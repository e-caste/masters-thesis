[SOUND LOGO]

00:00:03.493 --> 00:00:11.980 align:middle line:90%


00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.290 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Thank
you all for coming.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.670 align:middle line:84%
So we're entering the last
one-third of the class.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:84%
I guess the best way to talk
about that would be schedule.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.670 align:middle line:90%
So we're down to these--

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:90%
you just had your second exam.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.810 align:middle line:84%
And the last and
final problem set

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:40.320 align:middle line:84%
was released a bit
late over the weekend.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.120 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, you
should have it now.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So what we're going to do is
the welfare theorems today.

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000 align:middle line:84%
And then things like existence
of competitive equilibria

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.930 align:middle line:84%
and Nash equilibria,
Gorman aggregation,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.260 align:middle line:84%
when we're allowed to look at
that representative household

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:58.875 align:middle line:90%
or not.

00:00:58.875 --> 00:01:01.650 align:middle line:90%


00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.390 align:middle line:84%
And thinking about whether
models identify data.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.540 align:middle line:84%
In fact, whether you could
reject a model based on data.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.350 align:middle line:84%
So these first four lectures
are all in general equilibrium

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.540 align:middle line:84%
but nevertheless do
link to other themes

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.780 align:middle line:84%
that we've been
covering in the class.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, the last few lectures
go back to the welfare theorems

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.120 align:middle line:84%
and talk about how
they can fail but,

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.350 align:middle line:84%
in particular, also how you
can construct market remedies

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.880 align:middle line:90%
for failures.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.540 align:middle line:84%
And then, we end
with monetary theory.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.930 align:middle line:84%
So about, I guess, seven
or so lectures left.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.030 align:middle line:90%


00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.830 align:middle line:84%
And then, if we look on the
reading list, optimality

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.090 align:middle line:90%
and competitive equilibria.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.970 align:middle line:84%
This was the welfare
theorem lecture.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.050 align:middle line:84%
And there's only
one starred reading,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:90%
which is Kreps, section 6.3.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.460 align:middle line:84%
So again, I do recommend
that you look at-- this

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.020 align:middle line:90%
is more textbook style.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.590 align:middle line:84%
But it is written at a
fairly straightforward level.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.125 align:middle line:84%
And I think you
will find it useful.

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:15.090 align:middle line:90%


00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.640 align:middle line:84%
So let me start
in on lecture 16.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.240 align:middle line:84%
So the fundamental
welfare theorems,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.370 align:middle line:90%
there are two of them.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.900 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be
the focus today.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.880 align:middle line:90%


00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.250 align:middle line:84%
First one, competitive
equilibria or while raising

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.970 align:middle line:90%
equilibria are Pareto optimal.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.540 align:middle line:90%


00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.600 align:middle line:84%
We've defined both
concepts earlier.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.060 align:middle line:84%
We'll raise the equilibrium
Pareto optimality.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.670 align:middle line:90%
So that's review.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.950 align:middle line:84%
I've mentioned that these
welfare theorems are true,

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.030 align:middle line:84%
but we've never gone through
exactly under what conditions

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.725 align:middle line:90%
and how the proofs go.

00:03:01.725 --> 00:03:03.100 align:middle line:84%
That's the first
welfare theorem.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.390 align:middle line:84%
The second welfare theorem,
any Pareto-optimal allocation

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.480 align:middle line:84%
can be supported as a
competitive equilibrium

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.340 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.180 align:middle line:90%


00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.970 align:middle line:84%
And again, we'll go
through the proofs.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.440 align:middle line:84%
Actually, two kinds of proofs
of the second welfare theorem.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.215 align:middle line:84%
One, I would say
is constructive.

00:03:24.215 --> 00:03:26.510 align:middle line:84%
It's matching up
first-order conditions.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.060 align:middle line:84%
And the second one is using
separating hyperplanes

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.820 align:middle line:90%
in convex spaces.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:38.050 align:middle line:84%
The second is more general
than the first, in the sense

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.510 align:middle line:84%
that it applies to
many environments.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:45.580 align:middle line:84%
But the first
constructive proof is

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.550 align:middle line:90%
providing a lot of intuition.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.510 align:middle line:84%
So in some sense, when
these welfare theorems hold,

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.320 align:middle line:84%
you can go back and forth
between optimal allocations

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.900 align:middle line:90%
and competitive allocations.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.970 align:middle line:90%


00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.540 align:middle line:84%
A particular competitive
equilibrium is Pareto optimal,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.610 align:middle line:84%
but that doesn't mean that you
couldn't contemplate others.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.340 align:middle line:84%
It's associated with a
particular distribution

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:17.260 align:middle line:84%
of wealth from
private ownership.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.140 align:middle line:84%
And if you want to get to
other redistribute wealth

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.890 align:middle line:84%
and benefit, some at
the expense of others,

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.680 align:middle line:84%
find another
Pareto-optimal allocation,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.920 align:middle line:84%
there's also a way to support
any additional one like that.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.650 align:middle line:84%
But it is going to require
these kinds of transfers.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.340 align:middle line:84%
So that's the overall
theme for today.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.500 align:middle line:84%
So let me remind you, paste
in some slides from earlier.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.150 align:middle line:84%
This is village India,
with income over time

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:48.320 align:middle line:90%
and over households.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:54.410 align:middle line:84%
And you may remember this
gradient, that in some sense,

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:58.700 align:middle line:84%
average income is going up
as you go from the landless

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.210 align:middle line:90%
to the big landowners.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.560 align:middle line:84%
That's an income, but on the
same scale, so a bit harder

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.610 align:middle line:84%
to see, it is nevertheless
present in consumption

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.950 align:middle line:90%
as well, with this upsloping.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.810 align:middle line:84%
So in some sense, this
cross-sectional gradient

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.810 align:middle line:84%
reflects the lambda
weights, so to speak,

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.540 align:middle line:84%
when we solve for the
optimal allocation

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.190 align:middle line:84%
of risk sharing in this
village India environment.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.910 align:middle line:84%
We maximize the lambda
weighted sum of utilities

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.380 align:middle line:84%
and intuitively as
well as, in particular,

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.730 align:middle line:84%
for particular functional forms,
the higher are the lambdas,

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.880 align:middle line:84%
the higher would be
average consumption.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.480 align:middle line:84%
So that gradient reflects
the lambda, so to speak.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, we only looked
at Pareto optimality

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:55.070 align:middle line:84%
when we did the optimal
allocation of risk sharing.

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.440 align:middle line:84%
We didn't really link it up
to competitive equilibria,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.720 align:middle line:84%
but we're going
to do that today.

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.890 align:middle line:84%
And in particular, we could ask
whether the implicit lambdas

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.830 align:middle line:84%
in that gradient are
related to wealth.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.500 align:middle line:84%
Think about the village
achieving its allocation

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.070 align:middle line:84%
of resources to competitive
markets and, in particular,

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.690 align:middle line:90%
through private ownership.

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:18.800 align:middle line:84%
Then, we should see a
correlation between the lambda

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.020 align:middle line:84%
weights and other variables
that represent wealth.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:25.640 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think I showed
you this slide earlier.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.600 align:middle line:84%
It is in the paper risk and
insurance village India.

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.090 align:middle line:84%
And here, you can
see a regression

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:38.530 align:middle line:84%
of that gradient, the lambdas in
particular, that are backed out

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.850 align:middle line:84%
from the empirical work, from
the optimal allocation of risk

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:43.570 align:middle line:90%
sharing.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Those lambdas are
correlated with things

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.660 align:middle line:84%
like landholding, where the
value of the bull that they own

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.350 align:middle line:84%
and plow with and the
value of inheritance.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.170 align:middle line:84%
So that would seem
to suggest there

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:05.140 align:middle line:84%
is some correlation between
wealth and the lambda weights,

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:14.740 align:middle line:84%
although it's not uniform and
not true at all in Shirapur.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:18.460 align:middle line:84%
So it's mostly apparent in
only one of the three villages,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:19.870 align:middle line:90%
in Aurepalle.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.330 align:middle line:84%
And what you don't
know from this table

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:28.600 align:middle line:84%
is that the ownership of
bulls and so on moves around

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.630 align:middle line:90%
over time.

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:34.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's not so representative
of wealth anyway.

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:38.770 align:middle line:84%
So this might suggest that the
allocation in those villages,

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:42.910 align:middle line:84%
even if achieved through
competitive market forces,

00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:47.350 align:middle line:84%
also includes some
kind of redistribution

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.230 align:middle line:84%
from the upper-caste
landowners to the poor.

00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:53.520 align:middle line:90%


00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.300 align:middle line:84%
So let's turn to the
welfare theorems.

00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:02.760 align:middle line:84%
First one, suppose we had a
competitive allocation, denoted

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:08.190 align:middle line:84%
x star, y star with
price p and wealth w.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:84%
And actually, this slide
treats it more generally.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.390 align:middle line:84%
A competitive equilibrium
with transfers.

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:20.380 align:middle line:84%
A special case, of course,
of a competitive equilibrium

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.600 align:middle line:84%
would be no transfers and
just private ownership.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.560 align:middle line:84%
But let's start with a
competitive equilibrium

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.660 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:33.820 align:middle line:84%
And if preferences are rational
and locally nonsatiated,

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:39.750 align:middle line:84%
that allocation x star, y star
is Pareto optimal or, for sure,

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:43.320 align:middle line:84%
competitive equilibrium
or Pareto optimal.

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:47.910 align:middle line:90%
Strikingly, you don't need much.

00:08:47.910 --> 00:08:51.810 align:middle line:84%
All you need is essentially
rational preferences

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:55.200 align:middle line:90%
and local nonsatiation.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.110 align:middle line:84%
And intuitively, the
reason you need so little

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:middle line:84%
is that we're given
a lot to begin with.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:03.970 align:middle line:84%
We're given the existence
of a competitive equilibrium

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.640 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.142 align:middle line:84%
So we don't have to have all the
assumptions that go with that

00:09:10.142 --> 00:09:12.070 align:middle line:90%
that ensure that equilibrium.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.040 align:middle line:84%
That's kind of taken as
a given in the statement

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.890 align:middle line:90%
of the problem.

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:20.590 align:middle line:84%
In particular, we don't have
to talk about the consumption

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:24.130 align:middle line:84%
sets of the agents,
other than they

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:27.010 align:middle line:84%
have to be constructed
in a way that

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.530 align:middle line:84%
is consistent with
local nonsatiation.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.980 align:middle line:84%
We don't have to say anything
about production sets,

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:35.800 align:middle line:84%
other than evidently they're
nonempty because there's

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:42.220 align:middle line:84%
a y star up here, although in
principle, that could be 0.

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.430 align:middle line:90%
So very little is assumed.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.500 align:middle line:84%
So here's an illustration
in the Edgeworth box

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.240 align:middle line:90%
of the first welfare theorem.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.420 align:middle line:84%
We start out with the
endowment, private ownership.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:57.100 align:middle line:90%
No production.

00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:03.390 align:middle line:84%
And we find prices such
that each of the two agents

00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.970 align:middle line:90%
here are maximizing.

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:11.550 align:middle line:84%
And along their budget line,
it's the same line for each,

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:12.315 align:middle line:90%
in some sense.

00:10:12.315 --> 00:10:15.540 align:middle line:90%


00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:18.090 align:middle line:84%
Household 1 giving up
Good 1, getting Good 2.

00:10:18.090 --> 00:10:21.150 align:middle line:84%
Household 2 going in
the opposite direction,

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:24.060 align:middle line:84%
giving up Good 2
and getting Good 1.

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.050 align:middle line:90%
And here's the equilibrium.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:28.650 align:middle line:84%
And you can see
how beautiful it is

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.780 align:middle line:84%
because the marginal
rates of substitution

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.720 align:middle line:90%
match up with the price ratio.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.330 align:middle line:84%
And we've achieved the
competitive equilibrium.

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:39.810 align:middle line:84%
So competitive equilibrium
is Pareto optimal.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:42.130 align:middle line:84%
Of course, it's
not the only one.

00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:46.500 align:middle line:84%
There are many, many
others, as you can see.

00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:47.970 align:middle line:84%
But the first
welfare theorem just

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:52.980 align:middle line:84%
starts with a particular
competitive equilibrium,

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.200 align:middle line:90%
in this case, private ownership.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.315 align:middle line:84%
Now, how do we
prove the theorem?

00:10:57.315 --> 00:11:00.460 align:middle line:90%


00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.220 align:middle line:84%
The picture makes
it seem obvious.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.515 align:middle line:84%
But we want the proof
to be more general.

00:11:05.515 --> 00:11:08.530 align:middle line:90%


00:11:08.530 --> 00:11:13.560 align:middle line:84%
So if preferences are
locally nonsatiated, then,

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:19.310 align:middle line:84%
in particular, if the Xi star
of the competitive equilibria

00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:25.950 align:middle line:84%
is maximizing under
Agent I's preferences,

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:29.610 align:middle line:84%
maximizing in the sense that
it's the utility maximizing

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.770 align:middle line:84%
object in h and i's budget set,
this is expenditures less than

00:11:34.770 --> 00:11:41.340 align:middle line:84%
or equal to wealth, then for
any other point Xi, which

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:48.820 align:middle line:84%
is at least as good in
the preference as Xi star,

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.790 align:middle line:84%
it must be the case
that the valuation

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:56.680 align:middle line:84%
of that other allocation,
evaluated price's p,

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.770 align:middle line:84%
is not less than,
is greater than

00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:03.940 align:middle line:84%
or equal to the
valuation of expenditures

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.430 align:middle line:90%
at the competitive equilibrium.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:08.170 align:middle line:90%
That's kind a lot to take in.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:11.680 align:middle line:84%
The key part of it
is this implication,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:13.960 align:middle line:84%
and I used to have the
proof all written out.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.240 align:middle line:84%
But it takes like
six or seven lines.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.010 align:middle line:84%
Let me just give
you the intuition.

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:20.260 align:middle line:90%
Suppose it weren't true?

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:27.830 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that if pxi were
strictly less than pxi star.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:31.320 align:middle line:84%
Well, they're spending
everything they have.

00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.570 align:middle line:84%
So pxi star is their
wealth, and they could

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.480 align:middle line:90%
spend less if they chose to.

00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.840 align:middle line:84%
If pxi were less
than pxi star, that

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:45.810 align:middle line:84%
would be a point where
they're spending less.

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:50.060 align:middle line:84%
However, finally, we come
back to the nonsatiation.

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.350 align:middle line:84%
Draw a little ball
or circle around Xi.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.160 align:middle line:84%
If you remember the
statement, there

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.410 align:middle line:84%
has to be a bundle
that's strictly preferred

00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:01.230 align:middle line:90%
to Xi that's close by.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:07.450 align:middle line:84%
Since it's close by, it is also
spending less than Xi star.

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.410 align:middle line:84%
So now, there's
a preferred point

00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.700 align:middle line:84%
because Xi is at least
as good as Xi star.

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.170 align:middle line:84%
This other point is going to
strictly dominate Xi and hence

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:22.240 align:middle line:84%
dominate in the
preference at Xi star.

00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:25.560 align:middle line:84%
So there's a point in the
carrier of the budget set

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.040 align:middle line:84%
which is strictly preferred
to the chosen point Xi

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.360 align:middle line:84%
star, which contradicts
utility maximization.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.130 align:middle line:84%
Even took me quite
a while to say

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.400 align:middle line:84%
it, but it's quite intuitive
when you think about it.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.220 align:middle line:90%


00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:44.010 align:middle line:84%
So this innocuous
little Lemma is

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:49.050 align:middle line:84%
about to get used with the proof
of the first welfare theorem,

00:13:49.050 --> 00:13:55.150 align:middle line:84%
namely that a competitive
equilibrium is Pareto optimal.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:56.980 align:middle line:90%
Proof by contradiction.

00:13:56.980 --> 00:13:58.285 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not.

00:13:58.285 --> 00:13:59.800 align:middle line:90%
You say it is.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:03.440 align:middle line:84%
But I'm going to assume
it's not Pareto optimal.

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.480 align:middle line:84%
Well, any point that's
not Pareto optimal means,

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:09.440 align:middle line:84%
of course, you
guys all remember,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.770 align:middle line:84%
that there's a feasible
allocation, which

00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:15.050 align:middle line:84%
has the property
that it's at least as

00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:20.150 align:middle line:84%
good as the star competitive
allocation for all i

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:25.700 align:middle line:84%
and strictly dominates for at
least one agent, in this case,

00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:26.885 align:middle line:90%
denoted i prime.

00:14:26.885 --> 00:14:29.670 align:middle line:90%


00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we mean by Xi
star not being Pareto optimal.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:43.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, clearly, for
the guys, Xi prime,

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.330 align:middle line:84%
these bundles are strictly
preferred to the one chosen.

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.880 align:middle line:84%
So they cannot be
in the budget set.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:53.090 align:middle line:84%
So we have a strict
inequality in expenditures

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:54.515 align:middle line:90%
for those i prime guys.

00:14:54.515 --> 00:14:57.460 align:middle line:90%


00:14:57.460 --> 00:15:00.550 align:middle line:84%
But what about these guys that
were only weakly indifferent?

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:01.940 align:middle line:90%
That could be a problem.

00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.210 align:middle line:90%
But no, we've got it covered.

00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.040 align:middle line:84%
By the previous
Lemma, we already

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:11.460 align:middle line:84%
know that expenditures
are not less.

00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:16.050 align:middle line:84%
So we have strictly
greater, weakly greater

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:22.020 align:middle line:84%
expenditures of the alternative
supposed dominating allocation

00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.010 align:middle line:84%
with the given
competitive allocation.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.670 align:middle line:84%
Let's sum up the values
over all the households

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.270 align:middle line:84%
I, and we're going to
get a strict inequality.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:36.260 align:middle line:84%
So if it were true that there
exists an allocation, which

00:15:36.260 --> 00:15:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Pareto dominates the
competitive equilibrium,

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.560 align:middle line:84%
it would be associated
at the equilibrium prices

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:46.130 align:middle line:84%
with the higher
aggregate expenditure.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:51.620 align:middle line:84%
Then, the next step is to
review the definition of profit

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.130 align:middle line:84%
maximization in a
competitive equilibrium,

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:59.720 align:middle line:84%
meaning at yj star, the
valuation of profits

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:03.830 align:middle line:84%
is not less than
any other feasible--

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:09.290 align:middle line:84%
technologically
feasible vector yj.

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:14.310 align:middle line:84%
And this is true for each firm
j, hence true for all of them.

00:16:14.310 --> 00:16:17.120 align:middle line:90%
So we can sum up over them.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.440 align:middle line:84%
And now we take this
statement for firms

00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.980 align:middle line:84%
with the statement on the
previous slide for households

00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.420 align:middle line:84%
and start using them
both simultaneously.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:32.860 align:middle line:84%
So from the previous slide,
we have the summation over I

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.880 align:middle line:90%
pxi strictly dominates pxi star.

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:41.380 align:middle line:84%
But we also had a competitive
equilibrium given to us

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:46.210 align:middle line:84%
as an initial condition,
therefore feasible.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:52.630 align:middle line:84%
Therefore, xi star is equal
to omega bar plus y star.

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:54.440 align:middle line:90%
And I should have pointed out.

00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.670 align:middle line:84%
I think I just skipped
over it too fast.

00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.190 align:middle line:84%
It's easiest to
think about prices

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:02.600 align:middle line:90%
as being strictly positive.

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.450 align:middle line:84%
So the only algebra going on
here is to take dot products,

00:17:08.450 --> 00:17:12.500 align:middle line:84%
take prices, put it
outside the parentheses,

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:15.349 align:middle line:84%
then collect terms,
put it back inside.

00:17:15.349 --> 00:17:21.619 align:middle line:84%
So p dot xi, summation
over I, but Xi

00:17:21.619 --> 00:17:25.560 align:middle line:84%
is equal to a omega
bar plus yj star.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.660 align:middle line:84%
So if we put p outside and
then multiplied it inside,

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:35.130 align:middle line:84%
we get price times the
odd quantity object

00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.020 align:middle line:90%
in each of the two terms.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:39.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, this last inequality
is the statement

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:41.490 align:middle line:90%
of profit maximization.

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:45.600 align:middle line:84%
Holding the valuation of the
aggregate endowment of fixed py

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:51.060 align:middle line:90%
star j is no less than pyj.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle line:84%
And so now, we
again do this trick.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.480 align:middle line:84%
We take prices, put
in on the outside,

00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:01.200 align:middle line:84%
and look at all terms
inside the parentheses,

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:07.650 align:middle line:84%
and we've got the Xi over here
and the omega bar and the yj

00:18:07.650 --> 00:18:08.230 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:18:08.230 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
So we collect those
terms together,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:11.970 align:middle line:90%
and we get this statement.

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:14.280 align:middle line:84%
But if this is
greater than this,

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:17.610 align:middle line:84%
then when you subtract
them, it's greater than 0.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle line:84%
So we finally arrive
at the contradiction.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:21.840 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.690 align:middle line:84%
Because this supposedly
Pareto-dominating point

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.330 align:middle line:84%
has to be feasible in
the sense of the resource

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:34.560 align:middle line:84%
constraint, which means this
has to be 0 for each component.

00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:39.510 align:middle line:84%
But by the argument achieved, it
can't be 0 for every component

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:84%
or this could not
be greater than 0.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.490 align:middle line:84%
So it is not true
that it's feasible,

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:48.390 align:middle line:90%
and that's the contradiction.

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.970 align:middle line:84%
So it's a big proof
by contradiction.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.015 align:middle line:84%
So something's
happening along the way.

00:18:54.015 --> 00:18:59.390 align:middle line:90%


00:18:59.390 --> 00:19:02.370 align:middle line:84%
We're going to go to the
second welfare theorem now.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:07.280 align:middle line:84%
Any Pareto-optimal
allocation can be implemented

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:11.390 align:middle line:90%
as a competitive equilibrium.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:13.020 align:middle line:90%
We can come back to this slide.

00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.710 align:middle line:90%
But here's the picture.

00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:18.970 align:middle line:84%
So we pick another
Pareto-optimal point

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.720 align:middle line:90%
in that Edgeworth box.

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.660 align:middle line:84%
Not this one that ran
through the endowment,

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:27.920 align:middle line:90%
but something southwest of it.

00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:28.920 align:middle line:90%
So here's the endowment.

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.700 align:middle line:90%
It's still there.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.540 align:middle line:84%
But now we're targeting
this other Pareto-optimal

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.920 align:middle line:90%
allocation.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:39.070 align:middle line:84%
And the theorem
says there's a way

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.790 align:middle line:84%
to redistribute wealth in
such a way to achieve it.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.920 align:middle line:84%
Note the marginal
rates of substitution

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:48.520 align:middle line:84%
all match up for
Agent A and Agent B.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.620 align:middle line:90%
They're equal to sum price.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:54.880 align:middle line:84%
The price, p1 over p2,
is captured by the slope

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.570 align:middle line:90%
of that, quote, "budget line."

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.360 align:middle line:84%
But I really want
to say wealth line

00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.740 align:middle line:84%
because it is not a line that
runs through the privately

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.800 align:middle line:90%
owned endowments.

00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.280 align:middle line:84%
So the previous slide,
which I skipped,

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.810 align:middle line:84%
just says that those star
allocations for A and B

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:18.560 align:middle line:84%
have the same slopes, which
are their marginal rates

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.030 align:middle line:90%
of substitution.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:22.100 align:middle line:84%
And the marginal
rates of substitution

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.500 align:middle line:84%
match up since they're
equal to each other.

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.880 align:middle line:90%
Just something called gamma.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.830 align:middle line:90%
So that's the picture here.

00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:30.440 align:middle line:84%
Margin rates of
substitution are equal,

00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.290 align:middle line:84%
equal to the slope of
this wealth line, which

00:20:33.290 --> 00:20:36.670 align:middle line:90%
has a slope of gamma.

00:20:36.670 --> 00:20:41.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, the point is that
if they had started

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:47.760 align:middle line:84%
from the endowment, this
thing, agent B would not

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:52.740 align:middle line:84%
have enough wealth to get to
this Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.500 align:middle line:84%
Conceptually, imagining
somehow the slopes

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:01.080 align:middle line:84%
were the same if we had
drawn at those prices

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:05.790 align:middle line:84%
gamma line, a budget line
going through the endowment,

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:07.680 align:middle line:90%
Agent B has to be further out.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.570 align:middle line:90%
He has to have more wealth.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.920 align:middle line:84%
And where does that
wealth come from?

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:18.280 align:middle line:84%
Well, Mr. A over here
gets to make the sacrifice

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:23.950 align:middle line:84%
because he has gone southwest
of where he would be in terms

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:26.410 align:middle line:84%
of the budget line through
the endowment if we insisted

00:21:26.410 --> 00:21:29.290 align:middle line:84%
that didn't go
through the endowment.

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:32.130 align:middle line:84%
So all of that is
summarized on this slide.

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:36.390 align:middle line:84%
If we start out with
that price ratio--

00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:38.310 align:middle line:90%
by the way, gamma 1, why?

00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:43.300 align:middle line:84%
Because the slope of
this thing is p1 over p2.

00:21:43.300 --> 00:21:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So we might as well set p2
equal to 1 as the numerator

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:49.360 align:middle line:84%
because we're not
going to get any more

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.790 align:middle line:90%
determination than that.

00:21:51.790 --> 00:21:54.880 align:middle line:84%
So it looks weird when
you write it like this,

00:21:54.880 --> 00:22:00.506 align:middle line:84%
but p equal p1 equal
gamma p2 equal to 1

00:22:00.506 --> 00:22:03.710 align:middle line:90%
are the prices we need.

00:22:03.710 --> 00:22:08.570 align:middle line:84%
Agents are going to
maximize at those prices,

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.720 align:middle line:84%
depending on what
their wealth is.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:17.570 align:middle line:84%
But the allocation at
those prices for Agent B

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:22.520 align:middle line:84%
costs more than the valuation
of Agent B's endowment

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:27.260 align:middle line:90%
at the price gamma 1.

00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So what we propose
to do to Agent

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:34.460 align:middle line:84%
B is to give them
the difference,

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.250 align:middle line:84%
just give them
enough extra wealth

00:22:37.250 --> 00:22:43.080 align:middle line:84%
so that Agent B can afford
to buy the star bundle, which

00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:46.980 align:middle line:84%
requires more than the
valuation of his wealth

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.770 align:middle line:90%
at his previous endowment.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:53.520 align:middle line:84%
So we call this a transfer
to B. And it's positive,

00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:56.310 align:middle line:84%
as you could see
from that diagram.

00:22:56.310 --> 00:22:58.050 align:middle line:90%
And A makes the sacrifice.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:02.710 align:middle line:90%


00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.655 align:middle line:90%
There seems to be a typo here.

00:23:04.655 --> 00:23:09.510 align:middle line:90%


00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:13.670 align:middle line:84%
It's probably--
anyway, you can see it.

00:23:13.670 --> 00:23:16.030 align:middle line:90%
The wealth transfer is the same.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:20.790 align:middle line:84%
It goes from B to A, and
this is written oddly

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:24.360 align:middle line:84%
as if it were B's endowment
and B's expenditure.

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.120 align:middle line:84%
But it's really referring
to the point on the box

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.770 align:middle line:84%
here, which is simultaneously
the point for B and for A.

00:23:31.770 --> 00:23:38.460 align:middle line:84%
And so we just move southwest,
taxing A, and giving the tax

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.760 align:middle line:90%
to B as a physical transfer.

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.000 align:middle line:84%
So we found a price
equilibrium with transfers

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.080 align:middle line:84%
that will support that target
Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.090 align:middle line:84%
And it's possible to
do any one of them.

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.660 align:middle line:84%
So if you go back here, this
was the private ownership Pareto

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:56.520 align:middle line:90%
optimum.

00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:59.070 align:middle line:84%
There are all these other
Pareto-optimal allocations.

00:23:59.070 --> 00:24:04.740 align:middle line:84%
The theorem says, give me any
Pareto-optimal allocation,

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.550 align:middle line:84%
and I can redistribute
wealth in such a way

00:24:08.550 --> 00:24:11.620 align:middle line:84%
as to support it as a
competitive equilibrium

00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.020 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:16.200 align:middle line:84%
Who gets taxed and who gets
the transfers depends on which

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:20.170 align:middle line:84%
optimum we have
under consideration.

00:24:20.170 --> 00:24:24.640 align:middle line:90%
So this one takes more.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:29.250 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to start
assuming stuff for the theorem

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.090 align:middle line:90%
to be--

00:24:30.090 --> 00:24:34.470 align:middle line:84%
for sufficient conditions
for the theorem to be true.

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:39.150 align:middle line:84%
We start with the
notation of our economy.

00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:46.710 align:middle line:84%
Consumption sets for the agents,
utility functions, endowments,

00:24:46.710 --> 00:24:52.650 align:middle line:84%
production sets, shares
in ownership of profits,

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:56.190 align:middle line:84%
which is a quick review of the
notation you've seen before.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.420 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have to
assume that these consumption

00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:04.880 align:middle line:84%
sets essentially can be
formed by combinations

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.690 align:middle line:90%
of quasi-concave functions.

00:25:06.690 --> 00:25:10.370 align:middle line:84%
This first line is
the most awkward.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:13.220 align:middle line:84%
And if you wish,
you could just think

00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:20.090 align:middle line:84%
about these being the
non-negative orthant,

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:24.940 align:middle line:84%
that any positive
consumption bundle is fine.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:27.100 align:middle line:84%
I only put the most
general version

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:31.600 align:middle line:84%
because I want to emphasize you
need restrictions on things.

00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:35.860 align:middle line:84%
Here's a statement about
the production sets.

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.750 align:middle line:84%
Production sets Yj admit
a concave transformation

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.760 align:middle line:90%
function called F.

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.570 align:middle line:90%
What the heck does that mean?

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:49.600 align:middle line:84%
Well, it means that for any
vector Y in the production set,

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.870 align:middle line:84%
it can be represented
through some function

00:25:52.870 --> 00:25:58.480 align:middle line:84%
F, which is non-negative
when evaluated at that Y.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:01.960 align:middle line:84%
An example, because
this is really obscure,

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:05.950 align:middle line:84%
suppose we have
an input z mapped

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:11.070 align:middle line:84%
through production function
little f to get output q.

00:26:11.070 --> 00:26:13.370 align:middle line:84%
And we throw away
some of the output.

00:26:13.370 --> 00:26:16.880 align:middle line:84%
So we're not on the frontier,
we're in the interior.

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:23.814 align:middle line:84%
Then if you rewrite this as f
of z minus q, it's non-negative.

00:26:23.814 --> 00:26:26.470 align:middle line:90%


00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:34.520 align:middle line:84%
So any input-output
combination, zq,

00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.030 align:middle line:84%
when evaluated under F,
which takes this form,

00:26:38.030 --> 00:26:41.140 align:middle line:90%
is non-negative.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.260 align:middle line:90%
So it really is quite innocuous.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.060 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
convenient just to talk

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:50.240 align:middle line:84%
about this concave
transformation.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.000 align:middle line:84%
I should be emphasizing
again, these

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.010 align:middle line:90%
are sufficient assumptions.

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:59.390 align:middle line:84%
Something about consumption
sets being represented

00:26:59.390 --> 00:27:05.240 align:middle line:84%
by quasi-concave, this thing
being a concave transformation,

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.340 align:middle line:84%
preferences to get
down to 3 are going

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:12.320 align:middle line:84%
to be concave and
locally nonsatiated.

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.210 align:middle line:84%
Locally nonsatiated
we had before.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:20.340 align:middle line:84%
Concave is new, which
you know from one

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:22.890 align:middle line:84%
of the early lectures is
equivalent to preferences

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:27.450 align:middle line:84%
being rational, convex,
continuous, and nonsatiated.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:30.570 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we have
an interior point

00:27:30.570 --> 00:27:35.950 align:middle line:84%
so that none of these
constraints or representations

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:41.080 align:middle line:84%
are binding at 0, namely
non-negative, non-negative,

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:43.420 align:middle line:84%
and even in terms
of the resource

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:47.080 align:middle line:84%
constraint through
existing allocation, which

00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.610 align:middle line:84%
doesn't use up all of the
endowment plus production.

00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:57.560 align:middle line:84%
That's a technical
interior condition.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.910 align:middle line:84%
If we have all of these
things for this economy,

00:28:01.910 --> 00:28:06.160 align:middle line:84%
then we get the
second welfare theorem

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.020 align:middle line:90%
stated in terms of the lambdas.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:12.610 align:middle line:84%
For any lambda, which is
a Pareto weight vector,

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:17.650 align:middle line:84%
there exists a price vector p
in this L dimensional Euclidean

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:18.730 align:middle line:90%
space.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And our vector of
wealth, one for each

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.250 align:middle line:84%
of the i agents
such that x star,

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:31.670 align:middle line:84%
y star, p and w star is
a Walrasian equilibrium

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:35.170 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.750 align:middle line:84%
That's a formal
statement of the theorem.

00:28:37.750 --> 00:28:40.780 align:middle line:90%
Now, we're going to prove it.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.850 align:middle line:84%
And again, in the proof,
it's kind of easier

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:47.010 align:middle line:84%
to assume that those lambdas
are strictly positive.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And it will generalize
to some of them being 0.

00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.010 align:middle line:90%
But it just gets in the way.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So let's make it a little
bit easier on ourselves.

00:28:56.840 --> 00:29:01.610 align:middle line:84%
The proof is constructive
and a bit tedious,

00:29:01.610 --> 00:29:04.010 align:middle line:84%
but it is
straightforward enough.

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:05.570 align:middle line:90%
I'll try to guide you.

00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:11.090 align:middle line:84%
Step 1, characterize the
Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:29:11.090 --> 00:29:13.820 align:middle line:84%
That's the given that
we want to achieve

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.970 align:middle line:84%
with a competitive
equilibrium of transfers.

00:29:16.970 --> 00:29:22.190 align:middle line:84%
2, characterize the conditions
for a competitive equilibrium

00:29:22.190 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:90%
with transfer.

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:28.130 align:middle line:84%
And then, 3, kind of
match up those conditions

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:31.070 align:middle line:84%
and show that if we have the
conditions being satisfied

00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:32.960 align:middle line:84%
for the optimal
allocation, they're

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.920 align:middle line:84%
going to be satisfied for
the competitive allocation,

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.330 align:middle line:90%
if we choose properly.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:45.280 align:middle line:84%
This was the Pareto
problem, written out now

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.190 align:middle line:90%
for the fully specified economy.

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:51.550 align:middle line:84%
To find a Pareto-optimal
allocation,

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:55.430 align:middle line:84%
we're going to find the
solution to maximizing

00:29:55.430 --> 00:29:58.700 align:middle line:84%
a lambda-weighted sum of
utilities, subject to resource

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.400 align:middle line:84%
feasibility and
production constraints.

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:04.520 align:middle line:90%
Max, subject to 15 and 16.

00:30:04.520 --> 00:30:08.510 align:middle line:84%
You've seen this many
times before, in like six

00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:10.670 align:middle line:90%
or seven applications already.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:12.270 align:middle line:90%
This is a full statement.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:14.570 align:middle line:90%
So the so-called Pareto problem.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:16.640 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes I call it
the math problem.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:19.460 align:middle line:84%
And you may remember that
solutions to this problem

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:23.180 align:middle line:84%
generate Pareto-optimal
allocations

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:26.570 align:middle line:84%
and that any Pareto-optimal
allocation can be achieved

00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:28.080 align:middle line:90%
as a solution to this problem.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:32.030 align:middle line:84%
So we're not losing anything
by restricting our attention

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:34.070 align:middle line:90%
to these Pareto problems.

00:30:34.070 --> 00:30:37.190 align:middle line:84%
Second step is to
use the Lagrangian.

00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:40.400 align:middle line:84%
And the reason I was emphasizing
on the previous slide

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.820 align:middle line:84%
all the concavity and
convexity is those,

00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:47.000 align:middle line:84%
it's not just getting
the necessary conditions

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.210 align:middle line:84%
for an optimum from
the Lagrangian method,

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:53.180 align:middle line:84%
those conditions are
also sufficient when

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.550 align:middle line:90%
we have this kind of concavity.

00:30:55.550 --> 00:30:57.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll remind you momentarily.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.530 align:middle line:84%
So we've got production
constraints here.

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:02.670 align:middle line:90%
We've got resource constraints.

00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:05.360 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking for an
allocation consumption

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.240 align:middle line:84%
in the consumption
set, positivity

00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:12.980 align:middle line:84%
from those concave
transformations, and resource

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.210 align:middle line:90%
clearing.

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:16.340 align:middle line:90%
Here's the review slide.

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:18.440 align:middle line:84%
We did this, the
first time it came up

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:21.920 align:middle line:84%
was consumer optimization
subject to a budget.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:25.100 align:middle line:84%
And I said, oh, now we're going
to learn a cool tool, the tool

00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:26.880 align:middle line:90%
of constrained optimization.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.630 align:middle line:84%
So we maximize the function
subject to a series

00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:31.430 align:middle line:90%
of constraints.

00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:35.720 align:middle line:84%
We form the Lagrangian,
took derivatives,

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:39.800 align:middle line:84%
and looked at the additional
first-order conditions,

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:42.410 align:middle line:84%
which I'm about
to show you again

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.430 align:middle line:90%
in the context of the problem.

00:31:44.430 --> 00:31:46.470 align:middle line:90%
So that was a review slide.

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.630 align:middle line:90%
This is what we want to solve.

00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:52.350 align:middle line:84%
And the Lagrangian for
that is this problem.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:56.670 align:middle line:84%
So we want to solve to
maximize a lambda weighted sum

00:31:56.670 --> 00:32:02.880 align:middle line:84%
of utilities by choice of
an allocation Xi vector,

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:09.390 align:middle line:84%
with now we start writing out
the L resource constraints.

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:13.860 align:middle line:84%
But we put a Lagrange multiplier
gamma sub l in front of them,

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.160 align:middle line:84%
as we were instructed to
do from the algorithm.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:22.820 align:middle line:84%
We also put on to the
Lagrangian these positivity--

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:28.520 align:middle line:84%
these F's that represent the
production function frontier.

00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:30.260 align:middle line:84%
There are j of
those, and we come up

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:35.710 align:middle line:84%
with some notation for
the Lagrange multiplier.

00:32:35.710 --> 00:32:38.650 align:middle line:84%
And then, when we differentiate
this whole system,

00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:43.840 align:middle line:84%
say with respect to the L-th
good for the I-th household,

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.210 align:middle line:84%
we want to set the
Lagrangian derivative

00:32:46.210 --> 00:32:52.150 align:middle line:84%
to 0, which is the same thing as
lambda i U i prime add Xi star.

00:32:52.150 --> 00:32:55.000 align:middle line:84%
And where else does
that Xil enter?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.250 align:middle line:84%
It enters over here in
the resource constraint.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:33:00.040 align:middle line:90%
So it picks up a gamma.

00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.650 align:middle line:84%
And now, I start putting
stars on the solution

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:06.430 align:middle line:84%
because the solution
will satisfy

00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:07.820 align:middle line:90%
these first-order conditions.

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:10.510 align:middle line:84%
So there are special
allocations and

00:33:10.510 --> 00:33:14.940 align:middle line:84%
special Lagrange multipliers
because they are solutions.

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:20.610 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, for the L-th
good, for the J-th firm,

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:23.280 align:middle line:84%
set the derivative of
the Lagrangian with 0.

00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.750 align:middle line:90%
Where does that stuff happen?

00:33:24.750 --> 00:33:26.890 align:middle line:90%
It happens here.

00:33:26.890 --> 00:33:30.150 align:middle line:84%
So there's a picking
up a gamma l.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And over here, should
we pick up a derivative.

00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.270 align:middle line:84%
So this would be positive,
positive equal to 0.

00:33:40.270 --> 00:33:42.460 align:middle line:84%
So one of those terms
has to be negative.

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.600 align:middle line:84%
We subtract it off, and
we get this expression.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:51.280 align:middle line:84%
The gamma l is the
derivative of the function

00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.290 align:middle line:90%
F with respect to yl.

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:56.620 align:middle line:84%
This is for the J-th firm,
and we have this star

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.800 align:middle line:90%
on the Lagrange multiplier.

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:04.030 align:middle line:84%
So this equation 10 is
a set of conditions.

00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.360 align:middle line:84%
We need something, a
technical condition

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.739 align:middle line:84%
that there can be something
that these things are all--

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:12.429 align:middle line:90%
sorry.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:17.280 align:middle line:84%
Not technical, that the
constraints are all satisfied,

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:22.100 align:middle line:84%
and the Lagrange multipliers
are not non-negative.

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:25.600 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, this
complementary slackness

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.780 align:middle line:84%
condition that the
Lagrange multipliers

00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:34.780 align:middle line:84%
times the respective
constraints equals 0.

00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:37.420 align:middle line:84%
Probably a lot to
review, but it is

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.510 align:middle line:84%
in all this notation of the
environment exactly what you've

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:42.670 align:middle line:90%
learned before.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:56.290 align:middle line:84%
The point is that equations
10 and these others

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:03.930 align:middle line:84%
represent a solution to
the maximum Pareto problem.

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:06.150 align:middle line:84%
And they're not just
necessary, they're

00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:09.520 align:middle line:84%
sufficient because
of all the concavity.

00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:13.660 align:middle line:84%
And in particular,
these utility functions

00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.080 align:middle line:90%
are strictly increasing.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.500 align:middle line:84%
And I said earlier, everybody
has a positive lambda.

00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:24.910 align:middle line:84%
It's enough that at least one
person has a positive lambda,

00:35:24.910 --> 00:35:29.770 align:middle line:84%
then we're going to have to have
the gammas being positive y.

00:35:29.770 --> 00:35:33.250 align:middle line:84%
That's this thing because here's
the marginal utility, which

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:37.250 align:middle line:84%
is positive, a lambda,
which is positive.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:39.040 align:middle line:84%
So if the left-hand
side is positive,

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:40.730 align:middle line:90%
the right-hand side is positive.

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:46.040 align:middle line:84%
So that's where the positive
gammas are coming from.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.550 align:middle line:84%
So we know a little bit
more about the solution.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:49.870 align:middle line:90%
It's positive prices.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:54.760 align:middle line:84%
And from this complementary
slackness condition,

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:58.090 align:middle line:84%
if the prices are all
positive, and this whole thing

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:01.780 align:middle line:84%
has to be 0, then the interior
thing in brackets has to be 0.

00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:04.060 align:middle line:84%
So the resource
constraints are satisfied

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.060 align:middle line:90%
at equality, as is natural.

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:09.250 align:middle line:90%
So let's summarize.

00:36:09.250 --> 00:36:12.610 align:middle line:84%
We've characterized the
Pareto-optimal allocations,

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:14.530 align:middle line:90%
x star, y star.

00:36:14.530 --> 00:36:17.740 align:middle line:84%
Also denoted x star,
y star at lambda

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:21.250 align:middle line:84%
because we were given a
particular Pareto-optimal

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:24.370 align:middle line:84%
allocation, hence
a particular lambda

00:36:24.370 --> 00:36:27.910 align:middle line:84%
weighted sum was used in
the objective function.

00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:34.850 align:middle line:84%
And it's the solution to 14,
which is that Pareto problem.

00:36:34.850 --> 00:36:36.250 align:middle line:90%
So it's Pareto optimal.

00:36:36.250 --> 00:36:40.860 align:middle line:84%
It's feasible, and
there are these gammas,

00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:45.180 align:middle line:84%
which are strictly
positive for every good l.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:49.260 align:middle line:84%
And these Lagrange
multiplies on the production

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:55.490 align:middle line:84%
sets such that x star, y
star, gamma star, and phi star

00:36:55.490 --> 00:36:57.890 align:middle line:90%
satisfy 19 and 21.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:04.790 align:middle line:84%
19 and 21 were, yeah, something
happened in the process.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:05.425 align:middle line:90%
This is 10.

00:37:05.425 --> 00:37:08.540 align:middle line:90%


00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:14.960 align:middle line:84%
And 21 is the
feasibility constraint.

00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:15.460 align:middle line:90%
No.

00:37:15.460 --> 00:37:16.150 align:middle line:90%
It's right here.

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.650 align:middle line:90%
21.

00:37:16.650 --> 00:37:19.500 align:middle line:90%


00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.330 align:middle line:84%
So much for characterizing
the Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.780 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the second part,
characterizing the equilibrium

00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.910 align:middle line:90%
with transfers, just separately.

00:37:28.910 --> 00:37:30.680 align:middle line:84%
Forget the first
part for a minute.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.790 align:middle line:84%
We have a given while raising
equilibrium with transfers,

00:37:34.790 --> 00:37:36.230 align:middle line:90%
meaning what?

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.830 align:middle line:84%
Is x star, y star,
p and w star which

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:43.280 align:middle line:84%
must be consistent with
consumer optimization, profit

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:47.120 align:middle line:84%
maximization, resource
constraints being satisfied.

00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:50.360 align:middle line:84%
And since it's an equilibrium
with transfers, not necessarily

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.940 align:middle line:84%
private ownership,
we have to make sure

00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:55.340 align:middle line:84%
that the distribution
of wealths are feasible,

00:37:55.340 --> 00:37:57.680 align:middle line:84%
that the wealths add
up to the valuation

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:00.050 align:middle line:90%
of the endowment and profits.

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:02.690 align:middle line:84%
So let's just take
this one at a time.

00:38:02.690 --> 00:38:07.670 align:middle line:84%
Consumer op, firms
op, and start look

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:10.130 align:middle line:90%
at the first-order conditions.

00:38:10.130 --> 00:38:13.950 align:middle line:84%
Now, the third part of this is
putting these pieces together.

00:38:13.950 --> 00:38:16.010 align:middle line:84%
But at this point,
we're lost, right?

00:38:16.010 --> 00:38:17.880 align:middle line:84%
We don't remember
where we started.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:20.630 align:middle line:84%
We started from the
second welfare theorem.

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:25.130 align:middle line:84%
So we were given a
Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:28.070 align:middle line:84%
And we want to show that it
can be achieved as a price

00:38:28.070 --> 00:38:29.600 align:middle line:90%
equilibrium with transfers.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.650 align:middle line:84%
But we want to find the
components x star, y star, p

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:37.070 align:middle line:84%
and w star of the
competitive equilibrium

00:38:37.070 --> 00:38:39.380 align:middle line:84%
with transfers that's
going to give us

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.530 align:middle line:84%
back exactly the Pareto-optimal
allocations we started from.

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.280 align:middle line:84%
So let's start with
the households.

00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:50.870 align:middle line:84%
We have a set of conditions for
the Pareto-optimal allocation,

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:54.380 align:middle line:84%
and which are given because
we started with the Pareto

00:38:54.380 --> 00:38:57.150 align:middle line:84%
optimal-- now, you're not
used to seeing it like this.

00:38:57.150 --> 00:39:00.680 align:middle line:84%
We're usually writing lambda i
times the marginal utility is

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.030 align:middle line:90%
equal to gamma.

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.980 align:middle line:90%
Here it is.

00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:07.910 align:middle line:84%
All I did was divide
by lambda i and put it

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.170 align:middle line:90%
on the right-hand side.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:12.170 align:middle line:84%
That was part of the necessary
and sufficient conditions

00:39:12.170 --> 00:39:13.760 align:middle line:90%
for the Pareto problem.

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:14.720 align:middle line:90%
That's this.

00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:16.250 align:middle line:90%
So we're given this.

00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:20.570 align:middle line:84%
And we want to find Lagrange
multipliers mu and prices

00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:24.320 align:middle line:84%
p so as to satisfy this
optimizing first-order

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.980 align:middle line:84%
condition per household i in
the competitive equilibrium

00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:28.940 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.400 align:middle line:90%
Now, what would you guess?

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.780 align:middle line:84%
Well, we want-- this is
true, and we want this.

00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:38.560 align:middle line:84%
So let's guess that the
price that we want is

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:43.110 align:middle line:84%
the gamma, Lagrange multiplier
on the resource constraint

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:45.010 align:middle line:90%
for good l.

00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.380 align:middle line:90%
Pl equal gamma l.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.440 align:middle line:84%
And let's guess that the
mu that we want to find

00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:52.720 align:middle line:90%
is simply 1 over lambda i.

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.750 align:middle line:84%
That's down here
summarized at the bottom.

00:39:55.750 --> 00:39:59.290 align:middle line:84%
And the final guess would be
that the wealth allocation

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:02.050 align:middle line:84%
that we need in the
Pareto-optimal allocation

00:40:02.050 --> 00:40:05.650 align:middle line:84%
is just the valuation
of expenditures

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:08.650 align:middle line:84%
at that Pareto-optimal
allocation.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.380 align:middle line:90%
I use my words carefully here.

00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:15.580 align:middle line:84%
The valuation, though, is at
the shadow prices gamma l.

00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:18.700 align:middle line:84%
If you go back to
the Pareto problem,

00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.630 align:middle line:84%
these gammas were arbitrary
Lagrange multipliers

00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:25.620 align:middle line:90%
on the resource constraint.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:28.250 align:middle line:84%
And we went to the math of all
the first-order conditions.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:31.940 align:middle line:84%
But really, what
it is, is how much

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:38.620 align:middle line:84%
the solution that shadow price
reflects the incremental gain

00:40:38.620 --> 00:40:44.410 align:middle line:84%
in the objective function
to weakening the resource

00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:48.380 align:middle line:90%
constraint by a teeny amount.

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.350 align:middle line:90%
So it is like a shadow price.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:53.690 align:middle line:84%
We often call the Lagrange
multiplier shadow prices.

00:40:53.690 --> 00:40:56.800 align:middle line:84%
It's really marginal
utility pricing

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.520 align:middle line:84%
because we're incrementing
the weighted sum of utilities

00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:07.400 align:middle line:84%
a bit, hence like a derivative,
as we weaken the constraint.

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's natural really that
these Lagrange multipliers l,

00:41:12.830 --> 00:41:15.770 align:middle line:84%
for good l, should
be shadow prices.

00:41:15.770 --> 00:41:19.490 align:middle line:84%
And the actual competitive
equilibrium prices

00:41:19.490 --> 00:41:22.430 align:middle line:84%
in the corresponding while
raising in equilibrium

00:41:22.430 --> 00:41:24.560 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:27.650 align:middle line:84%
This thing down here,
very simply written,

00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:31.790 align:middle line:90%
is that mu i is 1 over lambda i.

00:41:31.790 --> 00:41:32.750 align:middle line:90%
Oh, who cares?

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:34.130 align:middle line:90%
No, no, no, no, no, no.

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:35.930 align:middle line:90%
Don't think of it that way.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.210 align:middle line:84%
Think of those beautiful
graphs of Kansas

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:40.310 align:middle line:90%
and so on at the beginning.

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:41.300 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.870 align:middle line:84%
So what this is
saying is mu i, which

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:46.790 align:middle line:84%
is the marginal
utility of income,

00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:53.408 align:middle line:84%
the marginal utility of wealth
in the target competitive--

00:41:53.408 --> 00:41:55.200 align:middle line:84%
we're raising an
equilibrium with transfers

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.580 align:middle line:90%
that we're trying to find.

00:41:56.580 --> 00:42:03.070 align:middle line:84%
The marginal utility of
wealth at that location

00:42:03.070 --> 00:42:07.670 align:middle line:84%
is inversely related to the
lambda weights in the Pareto

00:42:07.670 --> 00:42:08.170 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:11.080 align:middle line:90%


00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.990 align:middle line:84%
So the higher the
lambda weights,

00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:18.150 align:middle line:84%
the lower would be the
marginal utility of wealth.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.070 align:middle line:90%


00:42:21.070 --> 00:42:24.640 align:middle line:84%
Remember the first
two slides, I told you

00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:27.670 align:middle line:84%
that the gradient in
the consumption profile

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.340 align:middle line:84%
had something to do
with the lambda weights.

00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:32.140 align:middle line:84%
And we could look
in the data to see

00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:33.535 align:middle line:90%
if it was related to wealth.

00:42:33.535 --> 00:42:36.290 align:middle line:90%


00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:38.140 align:middle line:84%
So this may look
upside down, but that's

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:41.620 align:middle line:84%
only because mu i is the
marginal utility of wealth.

00:42:41.620 --> 00:42:45.410 align:middle line:84%
As wealth goes up,
marginal utility goes down.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.380 align:middle line:84%
So as lambda goes
up, and they're

00:42:47.380 --> 00:42:50.740 align:middle line:84%
more favored in
the Pareto problem,

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.350 align:middle line:84%
the marginal utility of
wealth is going down.

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:55.370 align:middle line:90%
And how does that happen?

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:59.700 align:middle line:84%
It happens because
they get more wealth.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:06.060 align:middle line:84%
So there's kind of a 1 to 1
mapping, a monotone mapping,

00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.350 align:middle line:84%
between the lambdas
in the Pareto problem

00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:12.890 align:middle line:84%
and the wealth that corresponds
to the competitive equilibrium

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.960 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And here it is falling
out in a very elegant way.

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:22.300 align:middle line:90%


00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:25.770 align:middle line:84%
And this other thing at
the bottom, that Wi star,

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:27.870 align:middle line:84%
is the valuation
of expenditures.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:33.450 align:middle line:84%
Again, that's pretty much
what we were doing in the box.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:36.090 align:middle line:84%
We took a target
allocation here,

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.120 align:middle line:84%
that it wasn't a
competitive equilibrium

00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:40.740 align:middle line:90%
with private ownership.

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:45.120 align:middle line:84%
But we could tax A
and transfer to B

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:51.000 align:middle line:84%
so these stars here represented
the target Pareto-optimal

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.450 align:middle line:90%
allocation.

00:43:52.450 --> 00:43:57.030 align:middle line:84%
And we're valuating
those expenditures

00:43:57.030 --> 00:44:02.080 align:middle line:84%
at the prices corresponding
to the budget line.

00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:04.530 align:middle line:84%
So you can start
them out with wealth

00:44:04.530 --> 00:44:09.280 align:middle line:84%
being at carefully
chosen prices,

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:15.430 align:middle line:84%
the valuation of the star
Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:18.430 align:middle line:84%
And that's this part
here at the bottom,

00:44:18.430 --> 00:44:20.230 align:middle line:84%
that the wealth
we give to Agent I

00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:24.790 align:middle line:84%
is just the valuation of the
Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:44:24.790 --> 00:44:28.450 align:middle line:84%
Now also is utility
maximizing allocation

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:32.270 align:middle line:90%
at the prices gamma, gamma star.

00:44:32.270 --> 00:44:35.390 align:middle line:90%
We did all that for consumption.

00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:38.900 align:middle line:84%
Something else happens
automatically along the way,

00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:43.470 align:middle line:84%
namely when you look at
those first-order conditions,

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:46.290 align:middle line:84%
we can define the marginal
rate of substitution

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:52.550 align:middle line:84%
of good l for good k for agent
I. The lambdas cancel out,

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:53.050 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:56.980 align:middle line:84%
It's lambda I for a
household i for any good l.

00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.990 align:middle line:84%
So if we take the
derivative of utility

00:44:58.990 --> 00:45:04.900 align:middle line:84%
with respect to the two
goods, in this case l and k,

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:08.330 align:middle line:84%
the lambda is in the numerator
and denominator it cancels out.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:13.860 align:middle line:84%
So this is the marginal rate
of substitution corresponding

00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.350 align:middle line:84%
to these optimizing first-order
conditions for household

00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.065 align:middle line:90%
I's, obviously equal to--

00:45:19.065 --> 00:45:23.240 align:middle line:90%


00:45:23.240 --> 00:45:25.730 align:middle line:84%
the I's, as I said,
are canceling out,

00:45:25.730 --> 00:45:33.510 align:middle line:84%
equal to the ratio of prices,
back to some other household h.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:37.440 align:middle line:84%
So this is the math of what
you already saw in the picture

00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:40.890 align:middle line:84%
that I've shown you three
times, the marginal rates

00:45:40.890 --> 00:45:43.440 align:middle line:84%
of substitution are
equated across households

00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.350 align:middle line:84%
and equal to the
common price ratio.

00:45:46.350 --> 00:45:49.320 align:middle line:84%
All of that coming from
the first-order conditions

00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:52.980 align:middle line:90%
that we've now formally derived.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:55.810 align:middle line:90%
One more step, firms.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:59.200 align:middle line:90%
So we have profit maximization.

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.990 align:middle line:90%
Oh, are you lost again?

00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:05.950 align:middle line:84%
I say that a bit tongue in
cheek because everything

00:46:05.950 --> 00:46:07.553 align:middle line:84%
is equivalent to
everything else.

00:46:07.553 --> 00:46:08.970 align:middle line:84%
And it's easy to
get turned around

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:11.240 align:middle line:90%
and forget our starting point.

00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:14.530 align:middle line:84%
So we started with a
Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:16.600 align:middle line:84%
We looked at the first-order
conditions, which

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:19.040 align:middle line:90%
are necessary and sufficient.

00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:24.140 align:middle line:90%
And we got this thing.

00:46:24.140 --> 00:46:27.190 align:middle line:90%
So this is true.

00:46:27.190 --> 00:46:29.500 align:middle line:84%
Now, we want to find the
conditions for profit

00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.340 align:middle line:84%
maximization in a competitive
equilibrium with transfers.

00:46:33.340 --> 00:46:38.800 align:middle line:84%
So we want this equation
to be satisfied.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:43.510 align:middle line:84%
As long as we can choose
the gammas and the piece

00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:46.840 align:middle line:84%
appropriately, we'll be done,
and it's easy to choose them.

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:49.570 align:middle line:84%
P, we already
pinned down already.

00:46:49.570 --> 00:46:50.530 align:middle line:90%
p sub l.

00:46:50.530 --> 00:46:53.770 align:middle line:84%
The price of good l
is the shadow price

00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:56.590 align:middle line:90%
derived previously gamma l.

00:46:56.590 --> 00:46:59.980 align:middle line:84%
And it just remains to figure
out what this delta l is.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Can we find that Lagrange
multiplier somehow?

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:04.390 align:middle line:90%
Searching?

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:04.900 align:middle line:90%
Sure.

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.200 align:middle line:84%
Let's let it equal to
the associated Lagrange

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:12.230 align:middle line:84%
multiplier and the solution
to the Pareto problem.

00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:14.660 align:middle line:90%
And again, because all these--

00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:18.740 align:middle line:84%
if you can satisfy this because
it's necessary and sufficient,

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.350 align:middle line:90%
then we have profit max.

00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:27.560 align:middle line:84%
So we just pick the delta
and the p to be what--

00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:30.560 align:middle line:84%
obviously, it would
be true so that we

00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:33.730 align:middle line:90%
have profit maximization.

00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:35.010 align:middle line:90%
So we're almost there.

00:47:35.010 --> 00:47:37.680 align:middle line:90%
We have a solution.

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:40.090 align:middle line:84%
We started with a target
Pareto-optimal allocation.

00:47:40.090 --> 00:47:42.960 align:middle line:84%
We have a solution to
the household problem

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.750 align:middle line:84%
in the competitive
equilibrium with transfers.

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:48.200 align:middle line:84%
We have a solution
to the first problem.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:49.950 align:middle line:84%
So what do we know
about feasibility,

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:55.080 align:middle line:84%
and what do we know about
the allocation of wealth?

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:59.520 align:middle line:84%
So we know what householdized
wealth has to be,

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.510 align:middle line:90%
as I've been saying.

00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:06.990 align:middle line:84%
It's just the valuation of
the assignment, the Xi star

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:12.380 align:middle line:84%
assignment in the Pareto problem
at the prices gamma equal to p.

00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.150 align:middle line:84%
So that's the wealth
of household I.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:16.235 align:middle line:84%
Let's sum them up and
make sure it's feasible.

00:48:16.235 --> 00:48:19.040 align:middle line:90%


00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:25.990 align:middle line:84%
So we sum up the valuation
of the target at prices p.

00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:27.910 align:middle line:90%
But now we do this trick.

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:29.320 align:middle line:90%
Bring p outside.

00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:30.940 align:middle line:90%
It's common.

00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:35.380 align:middle line:84%
I suppose it's strictly positive
in all the components too,

00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:37.270 align:middle line:90%
just to make it easy.

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:41.290 align:middle line:84%
Then, this summation
of-- because of we

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:44.050 align:middle line:84%
started with a
Pareto optimum, so it

00:48:44.050 --> 00:48:46.520 align:middle line:90%
had to be resource feasible.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:51.950 align:middle line:84%
So now, we use that fact, that
the summation over i Xi star

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:55.400 align:middle line:84%
must be equal to
the summation over i

00:48:55.400 --> 00:49:00.330 align:middle line:90%
of the endowment plus output.

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:03.200 align:middle line:90%
So demand is equal to supply.

00:49:03.200 --> 00:49:06.290 align:middle line:84%
Demand is equal to
endowments plus production.

00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:09.220 align:middle line:90%


00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:16.640 align:middle line:84%
And then, you can
rewrite the p dot yj's

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.110 align:middle line:84%
to be consistent with the
claim on those profits

00:49:20.110 --> 00:49:24.770 align:middle line:84%
under these ownership
shares, theta ij.

00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:27.680 align:middle line:84%
It probably would have
been clearer if p were also

00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:29.700 align:middle line:90%
still multiplying each part.

00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:30.380 align:middle line:90%
But it's there.

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:33.140 align:middle line:84%
It's just outside
the parentheses.

00:49:33.140 --> 00:49:35.930 align:middle line:90%
And then, we group--

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:38.750 align:middle line:84%
finally, we do put
the p's on the inside.

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:42.420 align:middle line:84%
And we have what we
want because this

00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:44.940 align:middle line:90%
is total wealth in the economy.

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.110 align:middle line:90%
It's the total value.

00:49:46.110 --> 00:49:48.390 align:middle line:84%
It's the valuation of
the aggregate endowment

00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:51.140 align:middle line:90%
plus profits.

00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:56.540 align:middle line:84%
And it adds up to the
sum of the wealths

00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:01.460 align:middle line:84%
that we need, according to
the solutions to the consumer

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:03.180 align:middle line:90%
maximization problem.

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:04.970 align:middle line:90%
So now we're done.

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.273 align:middle line:84%
This last slide is
always a bit mysterious.

00:50:07.273 --> 00:50:09.440 align:middle line:84%
It's like, well, why do we
have to do anything else?

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:12.170 align:middle line:84%
Well, again, just
remember the definition

00:50:12.170 --> 00:50:14.480 align:middle line:84%
of a competitive
equilibrium with transfers.

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.940 align:middle line:84%
Because it's transfers,
it's specified

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.590 align:middle line:84%
not in terms of
private ownership

00:50:18.590 --> 00:50:20.000 align:middle line:90%
but in terms of wealth.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.680 align:middle line:84%
So whatever those
wealths are, they

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:24.590 align:middle line:90%
have to add up to the total.

00:50:24.590 --> 00:50:27.880 align:middle line:84%
That's what this
slide is all about.

00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's what we call
the constructive proof,

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:37.560 align:middle line:84%
is just using finite
dimensional Euclidean spaces,

00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:40.680 align:middle line:84%
putting in a lot of concavity,
convexity, et cetera,

00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:43.740 align:middle line:84%
then sort of matching up
first-order conditions.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.260 align:middle line:84%
But the theorem
holds more generally.

00:50:46.260 --> 00:50:48.960 align:middle line:84%
The second welfare
theorem is true,

00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:52.650 align:middle line:84%
even without making special
assumptions about the commodity

00:50:52.650 --> 00:50:54.330 align:middle line:90%
space and so on.

00:50:54.330 --> 00:50:56.010 align:middle line:84%
A step along the
way is something

00:50:56.010 --> 00:51:00.360 align:middle line:84%
called the quasi-equilibrium
with transfers, quasi

00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:05.430 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's not quite
fully consumer maximization.

00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:07.690 align:middle line:90%
But it's going to be close.

00:51:07.690 --> 00:51:09.480 align:middle line:90%
So here's the definition.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:14.520 align:middle line:84%
An allocation, x star, y
star and a price vector p,

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:17.130 align:middle line:84%
constitute a price
quasi-equilibrium

00:51:17.130 --> 00:51:20.940 align:middle line:84%
with transfers if we can
find wealth levels that

00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:24.030 align:middle line:84%
add up to the total
wealth if each firm

00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:25.960 align:middle line:90%
J is profit maximizing.

00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.760 align:middle line:90%
So far so good.

00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.090 align:middle line:90%
Nothing different.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Here's the difference.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:32.670 align:middle line:84%
Household i, this
condition has to be true.

00:51:32.670 --> 00:51:37.230 align:middle line:84%
If Xi star is the
allocation we want

00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:40.950 align:middle line:84%
in the definition of the
equilibrium with transfer price

00:51:40.950 --> 00:51:43.470 align:middle line:84%
quasi-equilibrium
with transfers,

00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:46.620 align:middle line:84%
if you start with
that Xi star and there

00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:48.570 align:middle line:84%
were an allocation
that's strictly

00:51:48.570 --> 00:51:54.840 align:middle line:84%
better for household i, then
it costs at least as much

00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:58.350 align:middle line:84%
as the wealth assignment in
the price quasi-equilibrium

00:51:58.350 --> 00:51:59.050 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:51:59.050 --> 00:52:00.420 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of a mouthful.

00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:04.530 align:middle line:84%
One way to put this,
though, is that Wi star

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:08.640 align:middle line:84%
is the valuation of
expenditures at the equilibrium,

00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:10.860 align:middle line:90%
at the equilibrium Xi star.

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:14.820 align:middle line:84%
So then this says pxi, the
valuation of this arbitrary

00:52:14.820 --> 00:52:17.940 align:middle line:84%
Xi, which is strictly
preferred, the valuation

00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:22.200 align:middle line:84%
is not less than the
valuation of pxi star.

00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:26.310 align:middle line:84%
That means that pxi
star costs no more

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:30.930 align:middle line:84%
or is cost minimizing
over the upper contour

00:52:30.930 --> 00:52:33.330 align:middle line:84%
set of allocations
that are associated

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:35.280 align:middle line:90%
with strictly more utility.

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:38.175 align:middle line:84%
So you've seen this
before, way back when.

00:52:38.175 --> 00:52:41.970 align:middle line:84%
When we did the consumer
utility maximization problem,

00:52:41.970 --> 00:52:44.490 align:middle line:84%
I pointed out that this
is kind of a dual thing.

00:52:44.490 --> 00:52:47.280 align:middle line:84%
Instead of maximizing
utility subject to budgets,

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:51.090 align:middle line:84%
we minimized the budget
necessary to achieve

00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:52.710 align:middle line:90%
a given level of utility.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:54.540 align:middle line:90%
In fact, we did a lot with that.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:59.860 align:middle line:84%
We did Hicksian substitutions
versus Walrasian substitutions

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:00.360 align:middle line:90%
and so on.

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.560 align:middle line:90%
We had a whole lecture on it.

00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.680 align:middle line:84%
So here it is again,
except so instead

00:53:04.680 --> 00:53:07.410 align:middle line:84%
of assuming utility
maximization,

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:09.900 align:middle line:84%
we're going to assume
cost minimization.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:13.620 align:middle line:84%
That's the only difference
between a regular equilibrium

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:15.960 align:middle line:84%
with transfers and
this quasi-equilibrium

00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:16.650 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:53:16.650 --> 00:53:21.010 align:middle line:84%
The feasibility of the
allocation is the same.

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:23.130 align:middle line:84%
So I'll show you
the theorems now.

00:53:23.130 --> 00:53:27.660 align:middle line:84%
But just to say, when we do
the second welfare theorem,

00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:31.230 align:middle line:84%
we're going to say that it's
a price quasi-equilibrium

00:53:31.230 --> 00:53:32.130 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:53:32.130 --> 00:53:34.570 align:middle line:84%
And then, given the
structure of the economy,

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:37.140 align:middle line:84%
you may need a little
bit more to establish

00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.780 align:middle line:84%
that cost minimization
corresponds

00:53:39.780 --> 00:53:42.090 align:middle line:90%
with utility maximization.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:45.900 align:middle line:84%
So suppose that the production
sets are strict or convex,

00:53:45.900 --> 00:53:48.720 align:middle line:84%
the preference relations
are rational convex

00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:51.390 align:middle line:84%
and satisfy local
nonsatiation, then

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:middle line:84%
any Pareto-optimal allocation
has a price p such that x star,

00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:59.130 align:middle line:84%
y star p is a price
quasi-equilibrium

00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:00.060 align:middle line:90%
with transfers.

00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:03.900 align:middle line:84%
So it's looking pretty
similar, but we're

00:54:03.900 --> 00:54:05.740 align:middle line:84%
going to prove this
in a different way.

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:07.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's going to be
a proof that works

00:54:07.530 --> 00:54:10.860 align:middle line:90%
for quite arbitrary spaces.

00:54:10.860 --> 00:54:12.450 align:middle line:84%
And the proof
that's going to work

00:54:12.450 --> 00:54:14.970 align:middle line:84%
has to do with
separating hyperplanes.

00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:20.100 align:middle line:84%
So let me remind you
what that was about.

00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:22.920 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this is not
quite the right slide.

00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:27.300 align:middle line:84%
This was a review slide about
a supporting hyperplane.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:30.270 align:middle line:84%
The better slide was,
we had two convex sets

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:32.610 align:middle line:90%
that were tangent at a point.

00:54:32.610 --> 00:54:35.640 align:middle line:84%
And then we were able to
draw this hyperplane that

00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:40.200 align:middle line:84%
would be tangent to the common
slope of the two convex sets.

00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So all you needed
for the existence

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:44.940 align:middle line:84%
of supporting and
separating hyperplanes

00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:49.000 align:middle line:84%
is a presumption that
the sets are convex.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Here's a picture of it.

00:54:50.380 --> 00:54:52.990 align:middle line:84%
We've seen versions
of this before.

00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:56.080 align:middle line:90%
Here's one production set.

00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:58.690 align:middle line:90%
Here's another production set.

00:54:58.690 --> 00:55:03.860 align:middle line:84%
Here's the endowment somewhere
here, I think it was.

00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:07.540 align:middle line:84%
And so we add up the production
sets and the endowments,

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:11.780 align:middle line:84%
and we get this sort
of outer frontier.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.450 align:middle line:84%
The point being, it's
defining a convex set.

00:55:16.450 --> 00:55:19.800 align:middle line:84%
Things on the frontier
but also interior.

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:22.230 align:middle line:84%
Any linear combinations
of things in the interior

00:55:22.230 --> 00:55:24.740 align:middle line:90%
is also in the interior.

00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.720 align:middle line:90%
What's this other monster here?

00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:30.540 align:middle line:84%
This thing looks like
an indifference curve.

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.660 align:middle line:84%
But, in fact, we have
many, many households.

00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:34.740 align:middle line:90%
So what the heck is it?

00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:38.590 align:middle line:90%
Well, it's this thing.

00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:40.630 align:middle line:90%
It's the upper contour set.

00:55:40.630 --> 00:55:46.180 align:middle line:84%
It's the set of allocations,
which are weakly preferred

00:55:46.180 --> 00:55:50.050 align:middle line:84%
to the allocation x
star and summed up

00:55:50.050 --> 00:55:53.070 align:middle line:90%
over all the households.

00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:57.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's this thing that looks
like an indifference curve.

00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:01.300 align:middle line:84%
But because we have convexity,
this upper contour set

00:56:01.300 --> 00:56:03.100 align:middle line:90%
is also convex.

00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:06.160 align:middle line:90%
So now, we have two convex sets.

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:10.300 align:middle line:84%
We have a supporting
hyperplane for both of them,

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.340 align:middle line:84%
separating supporting
hyperplane.

00:56:13.340 --> 00:56:16.290 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to
define the price system.

00:56:16.290 --> 00:56:18.110 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind
of a graphical way

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:20.960 align:middle line:84%
to think about that
constructive proof

00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:23.360 align:middle line:84%
without taking
first-order conditions

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.970 align:middle line:84%
and matching up
Lagrange multipliers.

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:31.190 align:middle line:84%
We're defining using the
convexity and the separating

00:56:31.190 --> 00:56:34.020 align:middle line:84%
supporting hyperplane
theorems to get the prices.

00:56:34.020 --> 00:56:38.120 align:middle line:84%
So in 1954, Debreu
worked all this out.

00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:41.510 align:middle line:84%
He called his equilibrium
a valuation equilibrium,

00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:44.060 align:middle line:84%
as distinct from a
competitive equilibrium.

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:47.330 align:middle line:84%
Pareto optimality was
defined the same way.

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:49.410 align:middle line:90%
The environment is similar.

00:56:49.410 --> 00:56:53.420 align:middle line:84%
We have a finite number of
households getting allocations

00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.130 align:middle line:90%
in their consumption sets.

00:56:55.130 --> 00:56:59.000 align:middle line:84%
But when it says the consumption
set is a subset of this L,

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.570 align:middle line:84%
it does no longer mean a finite
dimensional Euclidean space.

00:57:03.570 --> 00:57:06.440 align:middle line:84%
It's an arbitrary linear
space, conveniently

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.450 align:middle line:90%
denoted L for linear.

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:10.850 align:middle line:84%
Preferences have a
complete ordering.

00:57:10.850 --> 00:57:12.290 align:middle line:90%
That's rationality.

00:57:12.290 --> 00:57:15.110 align:middle line:84%
Producers J have
a production set,

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:17.030 align:middle line:90%
choosing objects in the set.

00:57:17.030 --> 00:57:20.360 align:middle line:84%
Also a subset of
the linear space.

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.730 align:middle line:84%
Market clearing
looks pretty similar.

00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:27.140 align:middle line:84%
x equal y plus 6e or
x minus y equals 6e,

00:57:27.140 --> 00:57:29.180 align:middle line:84%
where x is the summation
over households,

00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:31.100 align:middle line:84%
y is the summation
over producers,

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.860 align:middle line:90%
and xi is the endowment.

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:37.670 align:middle line:84%
So we actually call a state
of the economy something

00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:40.670 align:middle line:84%
that's attainable being in the
production sets, consumption

00:57:40.670 --> 00:57:45.580 align:middle line:84%
sets, and satisfying
the resource constraint.

00:57:45.580 --> 00:57:48.280 align:middle line:90%
So then, we get to the theorems.

00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.200 align:middle line:84%
First and second
welfare theorems

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.920 align:middle line:84%
are similar, although the
assumptions are a little bit

00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:54.820 align:middle line:90%
different.

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.460 align:middle line:90%
Evaluation equilibrium, i.e.

00:57:57.460 --> 00:58:00.850 align:middle line:84%
competitive equilibrium,
is Pareto optimal.

00:58:00.850 --> 00:58:03.370 align:middle line:84%
What does the price
system look like?

00:58:03.370 --> 00:58:06.070 align:middle line:84%
In these general
linear spaces, it's

00:58:06.070 --> 00:58:09.040 align:middle line:84%
just called a linear
functional, meaning

00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.470 align:middle line:90%
that it's retaining additivity.

00:58:11.470 --> 00:58:14.260 align:middle line:84%
If you take the valuation
of a weighted average of two

00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.000 align:middle line:84%
bundles, it's the
weighted average

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.040 align:middle line:84%
of the valuation
of the two bundles.

00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:19.180 align:middle line:90%
Seems quite natural.

00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:22.330 align:middle line:84%
Obviously, for finite
dimensional Euclidean spaces

00:58:22.330 --> 00:58:26.060 align:middle line:84%
and the dot product,
this holds automatically.

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.790 align:middle line:84%
This is a generalization
of that idea.

00:58:28.790 --> 00:58:34.960 align:middle line:84%
So a valuation equilibrium is
attainable, maximizes utility,

00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.260 align:middle line:84%
subject to the budget,
and maximizes profits,

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:43.660 align:middle line:84%
where the price system is this
valuation function v. This

00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:48.040 align:middle line:84%
is literally utility
maximization because it

00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:52.810 align:middle line:84%
says that if it's in the budget,
it is not preferred to Xi.

00:58:52.810 --> 00:58:55.630 align:middle line:84%
If that weren't true, if you
had a point in the budget that

00:58:55.630 --> 00:59:00.070 align:middle line:84%
were strictly preferred
to the allocation Xi0,

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:02.020 align:middle line:90%
then it would be chosen.

00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:06.600 align:middle line:84%
So that would contradict
utility maximization.

00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:10.410 align:middle line:84%
The second welfare theorem
of valuation equilibrium

00:59:10.410 --> 00:59:12.990 align:middle line:84%
is a Pareto optimum
welfare theorem.

00:59:12.990 --> 00:59:18.360 align:middle line:84%
What we need, we need convexity
of the consumption sets

00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:22.560 align:middle line:84%
and a little bit more about
convexity of preferences.

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.840 align:middle line:90%
We did not need this previously.

00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.840 align:middle line:84%
When we had finite
dimensional Euclidean spaces,

00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.450 align:middle line:84%
I made a big deal of
saying all we needed

00:59:30.450 --> 00:59:32.640 align:middle line:90%
was local nonsatiation.

00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:35.070 align:middle line:90%
We need no satiation here.

00:59:35.070 --> 00:59:38.940 align:middle line:84%
We also need a little bit more
about convexity of consumption

00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.210 align:middle line:90%
sets and preferences.

00:59:40.210 --> 00:59:42.720 align:middle line:84%
So you're trying for
something bigger, something

00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:45.030 align:middle line:84%
that works for a very,
very large number

00:59:45.030 --> 00:59:46.740 align:middle line:84%
of economic
environments, you need

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.220 align:middle line:90%
to assume a little bit more.

00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:51.270 align:middle line:84%
The second welfare
theorem, any Pareto optimum

00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:53.950 align:middle line:84%
can be achieved as a
valuation equilibrium.

00:59:53.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:middle line:84%
So again, more things
about consumption sets.

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:02.550 align:middle line:84%
When your combinations of points
in the set are also in the set,

01:00:02.550 --> 01:00:03.660 align:middle line:90%
sets closed.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.240 align:middle line:84%
Production sets,
when aggregated up,

01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.730 align:middle line:84%
the aggregated
production set is convex.

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:12.930 align:middle line:84%
And here, either L is finite
dimensional or if infinite

01:00:12.930 --> 01:00:16.800 align:middle line:84%
or other dimensional, Y
has an interior point.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:19.050 align:middle line:84%
I know this is really,
really abstract.

01:00:19.050 --> 01:00:22.500 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to show you a couple
of applications momentarily.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:25.890 align:middle line:84%
And the theorem is,
assuming the 3, 4,

01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:31.300 align:middle line:84%
and 5, every Pareto-optimal
allocation, which is not

01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:36.040 align:middle line:84%
a satiation point, is associated
with a nontrivial continuous

01:00:36.040 --> 01:00:39.280 align:middle line:84%
linear function, where we have
a condition for households

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:40.780 align:middle line:90%
and a condition for firms.

01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:45.820 align:middle line:84%
So here, the condition for
households is that if Xi,

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:49.360 align:middle line:84%
we have the Pareto optimal
allocation Pareto Xi0.

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.030 align:middle line:84%
We have an allocation that
is strictly weakly preferred

01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:55.790 align:middle line:84%
to Xi0 and is in
the consumption set,

01:00:55.790 --> 01:01:00.160 align:middle line:84%
then this implies the valuation
of that other allocation Xi

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:03.430 align:middle line:84%
is not less than the
valuation of Xi0.

01:01:03.430 --> 01:01:06.670 align:middle line:84%
This corresponds to
cost minimization.

01:01:06.670 --> 01:01:08.620 align:middle line:90%
And again, just reverse it.

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:12.790 align:middle line:84%
If the valuation were
less than Xi0, then

01:01:12.790 --> 01:01:16.750 align:middle line:84%
that other point is, say,
better, maybe indifferent.

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:20.380 align:middle line:84%
But because we have
local nonsatiation, just

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:23.200 align:middle line:84%
like the Lemma, we could
construct something close

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.520 align:middle line:84%
by which is strictly better
and in the budget set for Xi0.

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.050 align:middle line:84%
So that would be
a contradiction.

01:01:29.050 --> 01:01:31.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is the cost
minimization part.

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:37.000 align:middle line:84%
This is why it's going to
be a quasi-equilibrium, not

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.190 align:middle line:90%
a full equilibrium.

01:01:39.190 --> 01:01:41.680 align:middle line:84%
So I feel like it
took a lot of work

01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:43.660 align:middle line:90%
to get through all of this.

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:45.970 align:middle line:84%
The main takeaways
are, there's a way

01:01:45.970 --> 01:01:49.090 align:middle line:84%
to do things more generally
with separating and supporting

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:52.990 align:middle line:84%
hyperplanes, as long as we
have sufficient convexity.

01:01:52.990 --> 01:01:55.990 align:middle line:84%
I took the time to take you
through Debreu's article.

01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:59.500 align:middle line:84%
It's really very similar,
apart from changes in notation,

01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:03.250 align:middle line:84%
to what we did with the finite
dimensional Euclidean spaces.

01:02:03.250 --> 01:02:08.260 align:middle line:84%
But it applies to
other economies,

01:02:08.260 --> 01:02:10.480 align:middle line:84%
in particular,
competitive equilibria

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.450 align:middle line:84%
in the space of
contracts, including

01:02:13.450 --> 01:02:16.030 align:middle line:84%
the possibility of
randomized allocations

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:18.690 align:middle line:90%
that we've used before.

01:02:18.690 --> 01:02:22.700 align:middle line:84%
So I think I mentioned
contracts with options,

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.520 align:middle line:84%
like CDs where you
could withdraw early

01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:29.150 align:middle line:84%
or pensions where you could
decide to take a lump sum

01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:31.130 align:middle line:90%
or take an annuity.

01:02:31.130 --> 01:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
I gave you those as examples
of contracts with options.

01:02:35.150 --> 01:02:36.650 align:middle line:84%
And then we had a
couple of lectures

01:02:36.650 --> 01:02:38.330 align:middle line:90%
talking about contracts.

01:02:38.330 --> 01:02:41.600 align:middle line:84%
I'm sparing you
working out through all

01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.670 align:middle line:84%
of that notation how the
contracts with lotteries

01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:51.020 align:middle line:84%
and indeed without
grids, so measures,

01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:55.160 align:middle line:84%
can be mapped into Debreu's
valuation equilibrium,

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:59.340 align:middle line:84%
and hence we get the
welfare theorems.

01:02:59.340 --> 01:02:59.840 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:03.010 align:middle line:90%
So that's all for today.

01:03:03.010 --> 01:03:11.000 align:middle line:90%

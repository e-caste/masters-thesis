00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.150
We consider the work done by
a gravitational force, which

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:08.070
was path-independent.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.444
Now let's generalize that to
any force between two points,

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:20.460
i, and another point,
f, that if the work done

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.550
going from the initial
point to the final point--

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.680
this is path-independent--
then we call this

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.802
force a conservative force.

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.350
There are many
conservative forces

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.600
that we'll analyze
in this class.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.540
Examples will be the inverse
square, electric force,

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.250
or the gravitational force.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.504
We've already seen
gravitational force.

00:00:49.504 --> 00:00:51.420
Near the surface of the
Earth is conservative.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.880
Spring forces are other
examples of conservative forces.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.820
But let's look a
little bit in detail.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.020
Suppose we call
this path 1 and we

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.000
consider a second path, path 2.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.590
Then a property of
conservative forces

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.740
is that the work done is
independent of that path.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.720
So if we total up the
work from the initial

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.560
to final on path 1 of f dot ds.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.590
And then we go from
the final point

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.800
to the initial point
on path 2 of f dot ds.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.550
Then because these intervals
are independent of the path,

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.229
and all we've done is shifted
the endpoints, we get 0.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.850
And that's the statement.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.620
And we'll write w conservative
here for conservative forces.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.500
So we're going to call
this force conservative

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.090
if it's path-independent.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.310
So what we have here
is the statement

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.550
that the work done by
a conservative force.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.120
Now what we'll do here,
is indicate a circle

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.640
by a closed path.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.350
The work done by conservative
force on a closed path is zero.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.490
What does a closed
path look like?

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.470
Well, remember, what we did
was we went from 1, but then

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.840
instead of going
in this direction,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.680
we came back on path
to, from the final,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.120
to the initial point.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.950
And if the force
is conservative,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.120
the work done around
a closed path is 0.

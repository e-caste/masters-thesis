Hi.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.020
I'm Angie, and
I'll be presenting

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.650
the recitation for this week.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.920
In lecture two, we saw
the story of Moneyball

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.740
and explored how to
build linear regression

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.570
models for baseball analytics.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.180
Today, we'll apply the same
method, linear regression,

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.770
to data from the
National Basketball

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.040
Association, the NBA.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.920
Let's get started.

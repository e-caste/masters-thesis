00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:22.260
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.870
As you're settling in, why don't
you take 10 more seconds

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.950
to answer the clicker
question.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.470
This is the last question we'll
see in class on the

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.780
photoelectric effect, so
hopefully we can have a very

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.110
high success rate here to show
we are all ready to move on

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.410
with our lives here.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.250
OK, good.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.480
So, most of you did get
the answer correct.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.460
For those of you that didn't,
you, of course, can ask your

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.890
TA's about this in recitation,
they'll always have a copy of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.860
these slides.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:56.280
But just to point out the
confusion can be we've

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.660
actually switched what
the question is here.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.950
What the information we gave was
the work function, which

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.610
is what we've been giving
before, but now we gave you

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.350
the kinetic energy of the
ejected electron, so you just

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.980
need to rearrange your equation
so now you're solving

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.190
for the incoming energy, which
would mean that you need to

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.810
add those two energies
together.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.950
So, hopefully everyone that
didn't get this right, can

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.130
look at it again and think about
asking it's just asking

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.610
the question in a different
kind of a way.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.940
All right.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.550
So, we can switch over
to the class notes.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.630
So today, we're going to
start talking about

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.880
the hydrogen atom.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.500
Now that we have our Schrodinger
equation for the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.740
hydrogen atom, we can talk about
it very specifically in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.170
terms of binding energies and
also in terms of orbitals.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.350
And we talked about on Wednesday
the conditions that

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.450
allowed us to use quantum
mechanics, which then enable

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.970
us to have the Schrodinger
equation, which we can apply,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.520
and part of that is the
wave particle duality

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.020
of light and matter.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:56.450
So there was a good question in
Wednesday's class about the

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.090
de Broglie wavelength
and if it can

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.200
actually go to infinity.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.380
So I just wanted to address that
quickly before we move

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.610
on, and actually address another
thing about dealing

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.660
with wavelengths of particles
that sometimes comes up.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:16.110
So, the question that we had in
last class, was if we have

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.370
actually a macroscopic particle,
and the velocity

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.670
let's say starts to approach
zero, shouldn't we have the

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.840
wavelength go to infinity, even
if we have a magic board,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.660
and even if the mass
is really large.

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.880
So, in most cases, you would
think that as the velocity

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.230
gets very tiny, the mass is
still going to be large enough

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.490
to cancel it out and still
make it such that the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.730
wavelength is going to be
pretty small, right.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.950
Because if we think about the
h, Planck's constant, here

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.040
that's measured in 10 to the
negative 34 joules per second.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.740
So, we would actually need a
really, really, really tiny

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.540
velocity here to actually
overcome the size of the mass,

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.195
if we're talking about
macroscopic particles, to have

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:04.380
a wavelength that's going
to be on the order.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.040
So, let's say we're talking
about the baseball, have a

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.610
wavelength of the baseball
that's on the

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.060
order of the baseball.

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.290
So, if we kind of think about
the numbers we would need, we

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.030
would actually need a velocity
that approached something

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.310
that's about 10 to the negative
30 meters per second.

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.640
So first of all, that's
pretty slow here.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.920
It's going to be hard to measure
anyway, and in fact,

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.640
if we're talking about something
going 10 to the

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.310
negative 30, and we're going to
observe it using our eyes,

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.640
so you using visible light to
observe something going this

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.370
slow, we're actually not going
to be able to do it because

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.880
we're limited by the wavelength
of light to see how

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.000
precise we can measure where
the actual position is.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.290
So let's say we have the
wavelength of light somewhere

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.010
on the order of 10 to the
negative 5 meters, being the

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.030
wavelength of light, we're
only going to be able to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.420
measure the velocity because of
the uncertainty principle

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.590
to a certain degree.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.070
And it turns out it's three
orders of magnitude that --

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.460
the uncertainty is three orders
of magnitude bigger

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.060
than the velocity that we're
actually trying to observe to

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.640
get to a point where we could
see the wavelength, for

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.240
example, for even a baseball
that is moving this slow?

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.330
So that the more complete answer
to the question is that

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.960
no, we're never going to be able
to observe that because

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.165
of the uncertainty principle
it's not possible to observe a

00:04:25.165 --> 00:04:27.680
velocity that's this slow for
a macroscopic object.

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.510
So, hopefully that kind of
clears up that question.

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.820
And, of course, when the
velocity actually is zero,

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.350
this equation that the de
Broglie has put forth is valid

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.900
for anything that has momentum,
so if something does

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.290
not have any velocity at all,
it actually does not have

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.540
momentum, so you can't apply
that equation anyway.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.770
And another thing that came
up, and it came up in

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.140
remembering as I was writing
your problem set for this

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.510
week, which will be posted
sometime this afternoon, your

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.910
problem set 2, is when we're
talking about wavelengths of

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.550
particles, and for specifically
for electrons

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.320
sometimes, you're asked to
calculate what the energy is.

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.820
And I just want to remind
everyone, so this is a

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:13.550
separate thought here, that we
often use the energy where

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.210
energy is equal to h c divided
by wavelength.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.290
So if we're talking about,
for example, we know the

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.530
wavelength of an electron and
we're trying to find the

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.300
energy or vice versa, is
this an equation we

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.640
can use to do that?

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.390
What do you think?

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.960
No.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.870
Hopefully you're going
to say no.

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.190
And the reason is, and this will
come up on the problems

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.670
and a lot of students end up
using this equation, which is

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:42.420
why I want to head it off and
mention it ahead of time, we

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.100
can't use an equation because
this equation is very

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.370
specific for light.

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.120
We know it's very specific for
light because in this equation

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.060
is c, the speed of light.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.590
So any time you go to use this
equation, if you're trying to

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.870
use it for an electron, just
ask yourself first, does an

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.030
electron travel at the
speed of light?

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:04.160
And if your answer is no, your
answer will be no, then you

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.470
just know you can't use
this equation here.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.660
So instead you'd have to maybe
if you start with wavelength,

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.580
go over there, and then figure
out velocity and do something

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.460
more like kinetic energy
equals 1/2 n b

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.660
squared to get there.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.835
So this is just a heads up
for as you start your

00:06:18.835 --> 00:06:21.170
next problem set.

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.500
All right.

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.750
So jumping in to having
established that, yes,

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.570
particles have wave-like
behavior, even though no,

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:31.460
they're not actually photons,
we can't use that equation.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.110
But we can use equations that
describe waves to describe

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.410
matter, and that's what we're
going to be doing today.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.570
We're going to be looking
at the solutions to the

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.740
Schrodinger equation for
a hydrogen atom, and

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.690
specifically we'll be looking
at the binding energy of the

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.380
electron to the nucleus.

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.640
So we'll be looking at the
solution to this part of the

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.130
Schrodinger equation where
we're finding e.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.780
Then we'll go on, after we've
made all of our predictions

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.770
for what the energy should be,
we can actually confirm

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:00.200
whether or not we're correct,
and we'll do this by looking

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.490
at photon emission and photon
absorption for hydrogen atoms,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:07.110
and we'll actually do a demo
with that, too, so we can

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.240
confirm it ourselves, as well
as matching it with the

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.080
observation of others.

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.060
And if we have time, we'll move
on also to talking about

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.780
the other part of the solution
to the Schrodinger equation,

00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:21.120
which is psi or this
wave function here.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.420
And remember I said that
wave function is just a

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.460
representation of the particle,
particularly when

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.400
we're talking about electrons
-- we're familiar with the

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.460
term orbitals. psi is just a
description of the orbital.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.740
So, we'll start with an
introduction to that if we got

00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.270
to it at the end.

00:07:39.270 --> 00:07:41.450
So, to remind you, when we
look at the Schrodinger

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:46.110
equation here, we have two parts
to it, so when we solve

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.980
the Schrodinger equation, we're
either finding psi,

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:52.950
which as I said, is a wave
function or an orbital.

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:57.070
And in addition to finding psi,
we can also solve to find

00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.960
e or to find the energy for any
given psi, and these are

00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.440
the binding energies of the
electron to the nucleus.

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.840
And the most important thing
about using the Schrodinger

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:09.180
equation and getting out our
solutions for potential

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.170
orbitals and potential energies
for an electron with

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:15.050
the nucleus, is that what
we find is that quantum

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.750
mechanics, and quantum mechanics
allowing us to get

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.140
to the Schrodinger equation,
allows us to correctly predict

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:24.450
and confirm our observations
for what we can actually

00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:27.620
measure are indeed the
energy levels.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.923
Here we're talking about a
hydrogen atom and that's what

00:08:29.923 --> 00:08:30.940
we'll focus on today.

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.550
And it's incredibly precise
and we're able to make the

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:35.860
predictions and match them
with experiment.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:38.270
Also, when we're looking at the
Schrodinger equation, it

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.020
allows us to explain a stable
hydrogen atom, which is

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.560
something that classical
mechanics did

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.760
not allow us to do.

00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.420
So here's the solution for a
hydrogen atom, where we have

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.040
the e term here is equal to
everything written in green.

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.260
We've got a lot of constants
in this solution to the

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:01.330
hydrogen atom, and we know
what most of these mean.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:04.850
But remember that this whole
term in green here is what is

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.480
going to be equal to that
binding energy between the

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:11.230
nucleus of a hydrogen atom
and the electron.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.430
So, let's go ahead and define
our variables here, they

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:17.830
should be familiar to us.

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:23.570
We have the mass, first of all,
m is equal to m e, so

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:29.360
that's the electron mass.

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.670
We also have e, which
is going to be the

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:40.010
charge on the electron.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:43.040
In addition to that, we have
that epsilon nought value,

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.820
remember that's the permittivity
constant in a

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:50.330
vacuum, and basically that is
what we use as a conversion

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:51.820
factor to get from units.

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:54.260
We don't want namely coulombs
to units, we want that will

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:56.630
allow us to cancel out
in this equation.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:10:00.330
And finally we have Planck's
constant here, which we're all

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.470
familiar with.

00:10:03.470 --> 00:10:07.140
So, what actually happens when
people work with the solution

00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:10.440
to the Schrodinger equation for
a hydrogen atom is that

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.990
they don't always want to deal
with all these constants here,

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.500
so we can actually group them
together and use them as a

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.690
single new constant, and
this new constant

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.450
is the Rydberg constant.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:25.940
And the Rydberg constant is
actually equal to 2 .

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.410
1 8 times 10 to the negative
18 joules.

00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:33.050
So when we pull out all of those
constants and instead

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:36.270
use the Rydberg constant, what
it allows us to do is really

00:10:36.270 --> 00:10:38.790
simplify our energy equation.

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.890
So now we have that energy is
equal to the negative of the

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:46.540
Rydberg constant divided
by n squared.

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.330
So, what we have left in our
equation is only one part that

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.320
we haven't explained yet, and
that is that n value.

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.460
And it turns out that when
you solve the Schrodinger

00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:57.700
equation, you find that there
are only certain allowed

00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.470
values of this integer n.

00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:07.020
And those allowed values range
anywhere from n equals 1, you

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:10.850
can have n equal that 2,
3, and it goes all

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.360
the way up to infinity.

00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.970
But the important part is that
there are only certain allowed

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:17.640
values, so for example,
you can't have 1 .

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.720
5 or 2 .

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.260
3, there are only these
interger numbers.

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:24.660
And this n here is
what we call the

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:34.630
principle quantum number.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:38.900
And what we find is when we
apply n and plug it in to our

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:42.370
energy equation, is that what
we see is now we don't just

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:45.810
have one distinct answer, we
don't just have one possible

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:48.450
binding energy of the electron
to the nucleus.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:52.070
We're going to find that we
actually have a whole bunch of

00:11:52.070 --> 00:11:55.550
possible, in fact, an infinite
number of possible energy

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:58.030
levels, and that's easier
to see on this

00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:00.700
energy diagram here.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:04.090
So, let's start with n equals
1, since that's, of course,

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.270
the simplest case.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:08.450
So, if we have n equals 1, we
can plug it into our energy

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:12.460
equation here, and find that the
binding energy, the e sub

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:15.650
n, for n equals 1, it's just
going to be equal to the

00:12:15.650 --> 00:12:18.320
negative of the Rydberg
constant, so we can actually

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.930
graph that on an energy diagram
here, and it's going

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:25.010
to be down low at the bottom
because that's going to be, in

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.650
fact, the lowest or most
negative energy

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.100
when n equals 1.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.240
But we saw from our equation
that there's more than just

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.530
one possible value for n, so we
could, for example, have n

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:42.110
equals 2, n equals 3, all the
way up to n equaling infinity.

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:46.160
So what this tells us here is
that this is not necessarily

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.100
the binding energy of the
electron in a hydrogen atom,

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.940
it's also possible that it
could, for example, have this

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.640
energy, it could have this
energy up here, it could have

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:56.390
some energy way up here.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:57.840
So we have this infinite
number of

00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.430
possible binding energies.

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.110
But the really important
point here is

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.550
that they're quantized.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:05.790
So it's not a continuum of
energy that we can have, it's

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:08.850
only these punctuated points of
energy that are possible.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.350
So as I tried to say on the
board, we can have n equals 1,

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.210
but since we can't have n equals
1/2, we actually can't

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:19.140
have a binding energy that's
anywhere in between these

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.980
levels that are indicated
here.

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.390
And that's a really important
point for something that comes

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:26.750
out of solving the Schrodinger
equation is this quantization

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.130
of energy levels.

00:13:29.130 --> 00:13:32.620
And thanks to our equation
simplified here, it's very

00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:35.420
easy for us to figure out what
actually the allowed energy

00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:36.530
levels are.

00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:40.850
So for n equals 2, what would
the binding energy be?

00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:41.910
Someone shout it out.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.590
Yup.

00:13:44.590 --> 00:13:48.690
So, I think the compilation of
the voices that I heard was

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.380
negative r h over 2 squared.

00:13:51.380 --> 00:13:54.930
We can do the same thing for 3,
negative r h over 3 squared

00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:57.170
is going to be our
binding energy.

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.590
For 4, we can go all the way up
to infinity, and actually

00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:05.540
when we get to the point where
it's infinity, what we find is

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.640
the binding energy at that point
is going to be zero.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.420
And when we get to infinity,
what that means is that we now

00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:17.620
have a free electron, so now
the electron has totally

00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.600
separated from the atom.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.580
And that makes sense because
we're at the point where

00:14:22.580 --> 00:14:25.640
there's no binding energy
keeping it stable.

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:28.470
You'll also know that all of
these binding energies here

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:32.050
are negative, so the negative
sign indicates that it's low.

00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:35.430
It's a more negative energy,
it's a lower energy state.

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.800
So whenever we're thinking
about energy states, it's

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:41.920
always more stable to be more
low in an energy well, so

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.720
that's why it makes sense that
it's favorable, in fact, to

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.720
have an electron interacting
with the nucleus that

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.010
stabilizes and lowers
the energy of that

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.000
electron by doing so.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.870
So, we actually term this n
equals 1 state gets a special

00:14:58.870 --> 00:15:02.230
name, which we call the ground
state, and it's called the

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:05.300
ground state because it is, in
fact, the lowest to the ground

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:05.950
that we can get.

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.740
It's the most negative and most
stable energy level that

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.900
we have. And when we think about
kind of in a more out

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.980
practical sense what we mean
by all of these binding

00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:21.460
energies, another way that we
can put it is to give it some

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.650
physical significance, and the
physical significance of

00:15:24.650 --> 00:15:28.540
binding energies is that they're
equal to the negative

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:30.960
of the ionization energies.

00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:34.750
So, for example, in a hydrogen
atom, if you take the binding

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.100
energy, the negative of that is
going to be how much energy

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.990
you have to put in to ionize
the hydrogen atom.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.920
So, if, for example, we were
looking at a hydrogen atom in

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:48.730
the case where we have the
n equals 1 state, so the

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:52.740
electron is in that ground
state, the ionization energy,

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:55.170
it makes sense, is going to be
the difference between the

00:15:55.170 --> 00:15:58.570
ground state and the energy it
takes to be a free electron.

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:01.810
When we graph that on our chart
here, it becomes clear

00:16:01.810 --> 00:16:04.420
that yes, in fact, the
ionization energy is just the

00:16:04.420 --> 00:16:07.380
negative of the binding energy,
so we can just look

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:11.410
over here and figure out what
our ionization energy is.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.160
So when we're talking about the
ground state of a hydrogen

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.930
atom, our ionization energy is
just the negative of the

00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:19.430
Rydberg constant, so
that easy, it's 2 .

00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:23.590
1 8 times 10 to the negative
18 joules.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:26.420
So, that should make a lot of
sense intuitively, because it

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:30.850
makes sense that if we need to
ionize an atom, we need to put

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:35.110
energy into the atom in order
to eject that electron, and

00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:37.480
that energy we need to put in
better be the difference

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.490
between where we are now and
where we have to be to be a

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:44.140
free electron.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:47.830
So in most cases when we talk
about ionization energy, if we

00:16:47.830 --> 00:16:51.080
don't say anything specific to
the state we're talking about,

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:53.820
you should always assume that we
are, in fact, talking about

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.330
the ground state.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.220
So, oftentimes you'll just be
asked about ionization energy.

00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:01.180
If it doesn't say anything else
we do mean n equals 1.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.280
But, in fact, we can also talk
about the ionization energy of

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:07.870
different states of the hydrogen
atom or of any atom.

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:11.560
So, for example, we could talk
about the n equals 2 state, so

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.400
that's this state here, and it's
also what we could call

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:15.810
the first excited state.

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:18.940
So we have the ground state, and
if we excite an electron

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:21.380
into the next closest state,
we're at the first excited

00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.620
state, or the n equals
2 state.

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:27.840
So, we can now calculate the
ionization energy here. it's

00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.910
an easy calculation -- we're
just taking the negative of

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:33.510
the binding energy, again that
makes sense, because it's this

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:35.610
difference in energy here.

00:17:35.610 --> 00:17:39.490
So what we get is that the
binding energy, when it's

00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.050
negative, the ionization
energy is 5 .

00:17:42.050 --> 00:17:46.580
4 5 times 10 to the negative
19 joules.

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:49.050
So we should be able to think
about these binding energies

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.660
and figure out the ionization
energy for any state that were

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:52.320
asked about.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.920
So if we can switch over to a
clicker question here and

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.720
we'll let you do that.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:02.690
And what we're asking you to
do is now tell us what the

00:18:02.690 --> 00:18:05.880
ionization energy is of a
hydrogen atom that is in its

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:21.120
third excited state.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:21.330
All right.

00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:36.030
Let's take 10 more
seconds on that.

00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:36.710
OK.

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:37.590
Interesting.

00:18:37.590 --> 00:18:40.280
Usually the majority is correct,
but actually what you

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:43.620
did was illustrate a point that
I really wanted to stress

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.880
and there's no better way to
stress it then to get it

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:48.080
incorrect, especially when
it doesn't count, it

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.860
doesn't hurt so bad.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.630
So, if you want to switch back
over to the notes, we'll

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:56.770
explain why, in fact, the
correct answer is 4.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.580
So the key word here is that we
asked you to identify the

00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:02.280
third excited state.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:06.630
So, what white is n equal to for
the third excited state?

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:07.910
4 OK.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:11.120
So that explains probably most
of the confusion here and you

00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:13.490
just want to be careful when
you're reading the problems

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:15.640
that that's what you
read correctly.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:18.720
I think everyone would now get
the clicker question correct.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.160
So, the third excited state,
is n equal to 4, because n

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.670
equals 2 is first excited, 3 is
second excited, 4 is third

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.060
excited state.

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.020
So now we can just take the
negative of that binding

00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:34.000
energy here, and I've just
rounded up here or 1 .

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.690
4 times 10 to the negative
19 joules.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:41.220
So, I noticed that a few, a
very, very small proportion of

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:43.530
you, did type in selections
that were

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.650
negative ionization energies.

00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:48.650
And I'll just say it right now
you can absolutely never have

00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:50.660
a negative ionization energy,
so that's good

00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:52.180
to remember as well.

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:54.240
And intuitively, it should make
sense, right, because

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.690
ionization energy is the amount
of energy you need to

00:19:56.690 --> 00:20:00.060
put in to eject an electron
from an atom.

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.290
So you don't want to put in a
negative energy, that's not

00:20:02.290 --> 00:20:05.010
going to help you out, you need
to put in positive energy

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:07.520
to get an electron out
of the system.

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.740
So that's why you'll find
binding energies are always

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:12.300
negative, and ionization
energies are always going to

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:15.040
be positive, or you could look
at the equation and see it

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.810
from there as well.

00:20:17.810 --> 00:20:18.240
All right.

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:21.440
So, using the equation we'd
initially discussed, the

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:26.010
negative r sub h over n squared,
we could figure out

00:20:26.010 --> 00:20:28.610
all of the different ionization
energies and

00:20:28.610 --> 00:20:31.320
binding energies for a hydrogen
atom, and it turns

00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:35.050
out if we change the equation
only slightly to add a

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:38.310
negative z squared in there, so,
negative z squared times

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:41.570
the Rydberg constant over
n squared, now let's us

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:46.250
calculate energy levels for
absolutely any atom as long as

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.600
this one important stipulation,
it only has 1

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.080
electron in it.

00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.540
So basically we're dealing with
hydrogen atoms and then

00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.240
we're going to be dealing
with ions.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.690
So, for example, a helium
plus 1 ion has 1

00:20:58.690 --> 00:21:01.250
electron at z equal 2.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:06.160
A lithium 2 plus ion has 1
electron, it has z equals 3,

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.790
so if we were to plug in, we
would just do z squared up

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.020
here, or 3 squared.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.610
Terbium 64 plus, another
1 electron atom.

00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:17.070
What is z for that?

00:21:17.070 --> 00:21:17.430
Yup.

00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.260
65.

00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:23.490
So again, terbium 64 plus, not
an ion we probably will run

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:27.580
into, but if we did, we could,
in fact, calculate all of the

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:31.030
energy levels for it using
this equation here.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.330
And the difference between the
equation, the reason that that

00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:37.500
z squared comes in there is
because if you go back to your

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:40.650
notes from Wednesday, and you
look at the long written out

00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:43.600
form of the Schrodinger equation
for a hydrogen atom,

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.250
or any 1 electron atom, you see
the last term there is a

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.010
coulomb potential energy
between the

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:51.960
electron and the nucleus.

00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:55.120
So, of course, when we have a
charge on the nucleus equal to

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.585
1, as we do in a hydrogen atom,
the z is equal to 1, so

00:21:58.585 --> 00:22:01.240
it drops out there, but normally
we would have to

00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:04.390
include the full charge on the
nucleus, which is equal to z

00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:06.940
or the atomic number
times the electron.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.780
So even if we strip an atom of
all of its electrons, we still

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.660
have that same amount
of positive

00:22:11.660 --> 00:22:13.680
charge in the nucleus.

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:17.500
So, this allows us to look at a
bunch of different atoms, of

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:20.230
course, limited to the fact
that it has to be

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:23.790
a 1 electron atom.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.630
So, now that we can calculate
the binding energies, we can

00:22:27.630 --> 00:22:31.600
think about is this, in fact,
what matches up with what's

00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:34.280
been observed, or, in fact,
could we predict what we will

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:36.800
observe in different kinds of
situations now that we know

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:39.820
how to use the binding
energy, and hopefully

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.100
we can and we will.

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:46.510
So one thing we could do is we
could look at the different

00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:50.080
wavelengths of light that are
emitted by hydrogen atoms that

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.820
are excited to a higher state.

00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:55.130
So what we'll do in a
few minutes here is

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:56.650
try this with hydrogen.

00:22:56.650 --> 00:23:02.740
So we'll take h 2 and we'll run
-- or actually we'll have

00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:05.880
h 2 filled in an evacuated
glass tube.

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.190
When we increase the potential
between the 2 electrodes that

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:12.430
we have in the tube -- we
actually split the h 2 into

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:16.200
the individual hydrogen atoms,
and not only do that, but also

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.600
excite the atoms.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.590
So when you just run across an
atom in the street, you can

00:23:20.590 --> 00:23:22.910
assume it's going to be in its
most stable ground state,

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:25.290
that's where the electron would
be, but when we add

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.060
energy to the system, we can
actually excite it up into all

00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:31.110
different sorts of higher states
-- n equals 6, n equals

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.740
10, any of those
higher states.

00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:36.210
But that only happens
momentarily, because, of

00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.080
course, if you have an energy in
a higher energy level, it's

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.890
going to want to drop back down
to that lower or more

00:23:41.890 --> 00:23:42.890
stable level.

00:23:42.890 --> 00:23:46.050
And when it does that it's going
to give off some energy

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:48.940
equal to the difference between
those two levels.

00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:52.000
And that will be associated
with a wavelength if it

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.210
releases the energy in
terms of a photon.

00:23:54.210 --> 00:23:56.260
So that's what we'll look
at in a few minutes.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.000
There's some important things
to point out about what is

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:00.260
happening here.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:03.000
Just to visualize exactly what
we're saying, what we're

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.280
saying is when we have an energy
in a higher energy

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.130
level, so let's say energy
level, this initial level high

00:24:10.130 --> 00:24:14.500
up here, and it drops down to
a lower final level, what we

00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.840
find is that the photon that
is going to be emitted is

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.960
going to be emitted with the
exact energy, and the

00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.230
important term here
is the exact.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:29.050
That is the difference between
these two energy states.

00:24:29.050 --> 00:24:32.120
That makes sense because we're
losing energy, we're going to

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.940
a level lower level, so we can
give off that extra in the

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.630
form of light.

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:38.780
And we can actually write the
equation for what we would

00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:40.980
expect the energy for
the light to be.

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.660
So this delta energy here is
very simply the energy of the

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:49.560
initial state minus the energy
of the final state.

00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:52.470
This is a little bit generic,
we're not actually specifying

00:24:52.470 --> 00:24:55.240
the states here, but we could,
we know we can calculate the

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.020
energy from any of the states.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:00.740
So, for example, let's say we
excited the hydrogen atom such

00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:04.790
that the electron was starting
in the n equals 6 state, so

00:25:04.790 --> 00:25:06.130
that's our n initial.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.760
And we drop down to the n equals
2 state, or the first

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:11.250
excited state.

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:14.080
Then we would be able to change
our equation to make it

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:17.810
a little bit more specific and
say that delta energy here is

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:22.200
equal to energy of n equals 6,
minus the energy of the n

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.860
equals 2 state.

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:28.060
When we talk about that
frequency of light that's

00:25:28.060 --> 00:25:30.590
going to be emitted, it's not
too commonly that we'll

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.700
actually talk about it
in terms of energy.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.450
A lot of times we talk about
light in terms of its

00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:39.260
frequency or it's wavelength,
but that's OK, because we know

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:42.840
how to convert from energy to
frequency, so we can do that

00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.700
here as well, where our
frequency is just our energy

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:49.610
divided by Planck's constant,
and since here we're talking

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.300
about a delta energy, we're
going to talk about the

00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:56.690
frequency as being equal
to delta energy over h.

00:25:56.690 --> 00:25:59.760
Or we can say the frequency is
going to be equal to the

00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.350
energy initial minus the
energy final all

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.090
over Planck's constant.

00:26:05.090 --> 00:26:07.660
So this means that we can go
directly from the energy

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.880
between two levels to the
frequency of the photon that's

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.230
emitted when you go between
those levels.

00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:17.590
What we can also do is say
something about the wavelength

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:20.150
as well because we know the
relationship between energy

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:22.640
and frequency and wavelength.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:25.300
So, in the first case here,
let's say we go from a high

00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:29.340
level to a low level, let's say
we go from five to one.

00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:32.660
If we have a large energy
difference here, are we going

00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:36.530
to have a high or
low frequency?

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:36.920
Good.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.360
A high frequency.

00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.830
If we have a high frequency,
what about the wavelength,

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:43.380
long or short?

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:43.720
All right.

00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:44.080
Good.

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.780
So we should always be
able to keep these

00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.390
relationships in mind.

00:26:47.390 --> 00:26:50.550
So, similarly in a case where
instead we have a small energy

00:26:50.550 --> 00:26:54.360
difference, we're going to have
a low frequency, which

00:26:54.360 --> 00:27:01.410
means that we're going to have
a long wavelength here.

00:27:01.410 --> 00:27:04.600
So now we can go ahead
and try observing

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.140
some of this ourselves.

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:09.870
So what we're actually going to
do is this experiment that

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.760
I explained here where we're
going to excite hydrogen atoms

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.040
such that they're electrons go
into these higher energy

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.340
levels, and then we're going to
see if we can actually see

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:23.610
individual wavelengths that
come out of that that

00:27:23.610 --> 00:27:25.840
correspond with the
energy difference.

00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.330
So, our detection devices are
a little bit limited here

00:27:30.330 --> 00:27:33.420
today, we're actually only going
to be using our eyes, so

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.120
that means that we need to stick
with the visible range

00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:38.080
of the electromagnetic
spectrum.

00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.200
Actually that simplifies things,
because that really

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.435
cuts down on the number of
wavelengths that we're going

00:27:42.435 --> 00:27:44.300
to be trying to observe here.

00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:47.770
So it turns out that in the
visible range, when you figure

00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:50.520
out the differences between
energy levels, in hydrogen

00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:53.470
atoms, there's only 4
wavelengths that fall in the

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.080
visible range of the spectrum.

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:58.120
So hopefully, when we turn out
the lights, we're going to

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:03.320
turn on this lamp here, which
has hydrogen in it and we're

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.140
going to excite that hydrogen.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:08.280
You'll see light coming out, but
it's, of course, going to

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:11.060
be bulk light -- you're not
going to be able to tell the

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.220
individual wavelengths.

00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:15.150
So what our TAs, actually if
they can come down now, are

00:28:15.150 --> 00:28:19.360
going to pass out to you is
these either defraction

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.230
goggles, or just a little plate,
and you're going to be

00:28:23.230 --> 00:28:26.870
splitting that light into its
individual wavelengths.

00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:30.960
And the glasses, there aren't
enough to go around for all of

00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:32.460
you, so that's why
there's plates.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.070
And though glasses do look way
cooler, the plates work a

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:37.470
little better, so either you or
your neighbor should try to

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:39.070
have one of the plates
in case one of you

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.300
can't see all the lines.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:49.920
So our TAs will pass these
around for us.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:53.390
And I also want to point out,
it's guaranteed pretty much

00:28:53.390 --> 00:28:56.040
you'll be able to see these
three here in the visible

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.860
range -- you may or may not be
able to see, sometimes it's

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:03.550
hard to see that one that's
getting near the UV end of our

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:04.550
visible spectrum.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:14.490
So we won't worry if
we can't see that.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:24.590
I'll take one actually.

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:53.330
Can you raise your hand if you
if you still need one?

00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:56.350
All right, so TA's walk
carefully now, I'm going to

00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:58.210
shut the lights down here.

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:10.140
All right, so we do still have
some little bits of ambient

00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:12.360
light, so you might
see a slight

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.290
amount of the full continuum.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.370
But if you look through your
plate, and actually especially

00:30:17.370 --> 00:30:20.810
if you kind of look off to the
side, hopefully you'll be able

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:25.240
to see the individual lines
of the spectrum.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.480
Is everyone seeing that?

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.390
Yeah, pretty much.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:29.730
OK.

00:30:29.730 --> 00:30:30.880
Can anyone not see it?

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.850
Does anyone need -- actually
I can't even tell if

00:30:32.850 --> 00:30:33.480
you raise your hand.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.380
So ask your neighbor if you
can't see it and get one of

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:37.680
the plates if you're
having trouble

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.470
seeing with the glasses.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.980
So this should match up with
the spectrum that we saw.

00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:46.380
And actually keep those
glasses with you.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.710
We'll turn the light back
on for a second here.

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:53.400
And hydrogen atom is what
we're learning about, so

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:54.740
that's the most relevant here.

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:58.580
But just to show you that each
atom does have its own set of

00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.990
spectral lines, just for fun
we'll look at neon also so you

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:17.280
can have a comparison point.

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.690
All right.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.320
So, this is probably a familiar
color having seen

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:28.720
many neon lights around
everywhere.

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.780
So you see with the neon is
there's just a lot more lines

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.700
in that orange part of the
spectrum then compared to the

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:39.980
hydrogen, and that's really what
gives you that neon color

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.480
in the neon signs.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.160
That's the true color of a neon
being excited, sometimes

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:49.060
neon signs are painted
with other compounds.

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.970
All right, does everyone
have their fill of

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:51.890
seeing the neon lines?

00:31:51.890 --> 00:31:53.950
STUDENT: No.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:56.490
PROFESSOR: All right, let's take
two more seconds to look

00:31:56.490 --> 00:32:01.920
at neon then.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.350
All right.

00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:08.350
So our special effects portion
of the class is over.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.850
And what you see when we see it
with our eye, which is all

00:32:10.850 --> 00:32:13.580
the wavelengths, of course,
mixed together, is whichever

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:15.900
those wavelengths
is most intense.

00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:18.290
So, when we looked at the
individual neon lines, it was

00:32:18.290 --> 00:32:21.560
the orange colors that was most
intense, which is why we

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.330
were seeing kind of a general
orange glow with the neon,

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:29.290
which is different from what
we see with the hydrogen.

00:32:29.290 --> 00:32:35.400
All right, so we can, in fact,
observe individual lines.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.860
There's nothing more exciting
to see with your glasses on,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:38.590
while you look nice.

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:42.690
You can take those off if you
wish to, or you can try to

00:32:42.690 --> 00:32:46.490
just be splitting the light in
the room until the TAs grab

00:32:46.490 --> 00:32:48.360
your glasses, either is fine.

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.130
It turns out that we are far
from the first people,

00:32:51.130 --> 00:32:53.950
although it felt exciting, we
did not discover this for the

00:32:53.950 --> 00:32:56.570
first time here today.

00:32:56.570 --> 00:33:01.930
In fact, J.J. Balmer, who was a
school teacher in the 1800s,

00:33:01.930 --> 00:33:05.810
was the first to describe these
lines that could be seen

00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:07.130
from hydrogen.

00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:11.060
And he saw the same lines that
we saw here today, and

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:16.200
although he could not explain,
even start to explain why you

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:19.090
saw only these specific
lines and not a whole

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:20.310
continuum of the light.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:22.600
Right, we already have an idea
because we just talked about

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.860
energy levels, we know there's
only certain allowed energy

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.540
levels, but at the time there's
no reason J.J. Balmer

00:33:27.540 --> 00:33:30.410
should have known this, and in
fact he didn't, but he still

00:33:30.410 --> 00:33:33.750
came up with a quantitative
way to describe

00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:34.920
what was going on.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:38.720
He came up with this equation
here where what he found was

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.180
that he could explain the
wavelengths of these different

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:48.040
lines by multiplying 1 over 4
minus 1 over some integer n,

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:51.140
and multiplying it by
this number, 3 .

00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:55.300
29 times 10 to the 15 Hertz,
and he found that this was

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.510
true where n was some
integer value --

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.900
3, 4, 5, or 6.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:11.990
So he could explain it
quantitatively in terms of

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:14.100
putting an equation with it, but
he couldn't explain what

00:34:14.100 --> 00:34:15.780
was actually going on.

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.310
But we, having learned about
energy levels, having had the

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:22.670
Schrodinger equation solved for
us to understand what's

00:34:22.670 --> 00:34:26.420
going on, can, in fact, explain
what happened when we

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:28.420
saw these different colors.

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.440
So, what we know is happening
is that were having

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:36.590
transitions from some excited
states to a more relaxed

00:34:36.590 --> 00:34:39.360
lower, more stable state
in the hydrogen atom.

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:43.630
And it turns out what we can
detect visibly with our eyes

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:46.930
is in the visible range, and
that means that the final

00:34:46.930 --> 00:34:49.630
state is n equals 2.

00:34:49.630 --> 00:34:52.830
Because you see how n equals 1
is so much further away, and

00:34:52.830 --> 00:34:55.060
actually that's not to scale,
it's actually much, much

00:34:55.060 --> 00:34:58.570
further down in the energy well,
such that the energy of

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:01.500
the light is so great that
it's going to be in

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.630
ultraviolet very high energy,
high frequency range.

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.600
So we can't actually see any of
that, it's too high energy

00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.560
for us to see.

00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.940
So everything we see is going to
be where we have the final

00:35:11.940 --> 00:35:15.210
energy state being n equals 2.

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:19.310
So if we think about, for
example, this red line here,

00:35:19.310 --> 00:35:23.980
which energy state or which
principle quantum number do

00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:30.450
you think that our electron
started in?

00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:30.910
STUDENT: Three.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:31.230
PROFESSOR: Good.

00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:33.540
So, it's going to be in 3,
because that's the shortest

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.960
energy difference we can have,
and the red is the longest

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.960
wavelength we can see -- those 2
are inversely related, so it

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.960
must be n equals 3.

00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:47.640
What about the kind of cyan-ish,
blue-green one?

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.440
Yup. so n equals
4 for that one.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:53.240
Similarly we can go on,
match up the others.

00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:56.630
So n equals 5 for the
bluish-purple and the violet

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:58.250
is n equals 6.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:01.230
And again, that matches up,
because the violet, or getting

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:05.750
really close to the UV range
here has the longest energy,

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.510
so the highest frequency, and
that's going to be the

00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:11.170
shortest wavelength and we can
see here it is, in fact, the

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:15.470
shortest wavelength that
we can actually see.

00:36:15.470 --> 00:36:19.670
So, we can see if we can come up
with the same equation that

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:23.700
J.J. Balmer came up with by
actually starting with what we

00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:26.830
know and working our way that
way instead of coming up from

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.880
the other direction, which he
did, which was just to explain

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.070
what he saw.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:33.830
So, if we start instead with
talking about the energy

00:36:33.830 --> 00:36:36.850
levels, we can relate these to
frequency, because we already

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:40.050
said that frequency is related
to, or it's equal to the

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:43.840
initial energy level here minus
the final energy level

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:47.540
there over Planck's constant
to get us to frequency.

00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.480
And we also have the equation
that comes out of Schrodinger

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.420
equation that tell us exactly
what that binding energy is,

00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.260
that binding energy is just
equal to the negative of the

00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:01.800
Rydberg constant
over n squared.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:05.060
So that means that our frequency
is going to equal,

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:10.250
if we plug in e n into the
initial and final energy here,

00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:14.690
1 over Planck's constant times
negative r h over n initial

00:37:14.690 --> 00:37:19.890
squared, minus negative r
h over n final squared.

00:37:19.890 --> 00:37:22.990
So we have an equation that
should relate how we can

00:37:22.990 --> 00:37:26.630
actually calculate
the frequency to

00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:29.180
what J.J. Balmer observed.

00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.055
We can simplify this equation
by pulling up the r h and

00:37:32.055 --> 00:37:35.450
getting rid of some of these
negatives here by saying the

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.560
frequency is going to be equal
to the Rydberg constant

00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:43.120
divided by Planck's constant
all times 1 over n final

00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.120
squared -- this is just to
switch the signs around and

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.460
get rid of some negatives
-- minus 1

00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:53.130
over n initial squared.

00:37:53.130 --> 00:37:56.760
We can plug this in further when
we're talking about the

00:37:56.760 --> 00:38:00.170
visible part of the light
spectrum, because we know that

00:38:00.170 --> 00:38:04.160
for n final equals 2, then that
would mean we plug in 2

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:06.940
squared here, so what
we get is 1 over 4.

00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.570
So this is our final equation,
and this is actually called

00:38:10.570 --> 00:38:13.590
the Balmer series, which was
named after Balmer, and this

00:38:13.590 --> 00:38:18.010
tells us the frequency of any
of the lights where we start

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:20.490
with an electron in some higher
energy level and we

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:23.300
drop down to an n final
that's equal to 2.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:25.690
So it's a more specific version
of the equation where

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:28.980
we have the n final
equal to 2.

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:31.930
And it turns out that actually
we find that this matches up

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:36.420
perfectly with Balmer's
equation, because the value of

00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:39.460
r h, the Rydberg constant
divided by the Planck's

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.950
constant is actually -- it's
also another constant, so we

00:38:42.950 --> 00:38:44.370
can write it as this
kind of strange

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:46.430
looking cursive r here.

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.630
Unfortunately, this is also call
the Rydberg constant, so

00:38:49.630 --> 00:38:50.800
it's a little bit confusing.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.560
But really it means the Rydberg
constant divided by h,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.250
and that's equal to 3 .

00:38:57.250 --> 00:38:59.970
29 times 10 to the
15 per second.

00:38:59.970 --> 00:39:04.140
So if you remember what the
equation Balmer found was this

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:06.470
number multiplied
by this here.

00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:09.830
So, we found the exact same
equation, but just now

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.730
starting from understanding
the difference

00:39:11.730 --> 00:39:14.000
between energy levels.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.740
So, sometimes you'll find the
Rydberg constant in different

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:21.010
forms, but just make sure you
pay attention to units because

00:39:21.010 --> 00:39:23.350
then you won't mess them up,
because this is in inverse

00:39:23.350 --> 00:39:26.230
seconds here, the other Rydberg
constant is in joules,

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:29.470
so you'll be able to use what
you need depending on how

00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:33.230
you're using that constant.

00:39:33.230 --> 00:39:37.570
So in talking about the hydrogen
atom, they actually

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:42.440
have different names for
different series, which means

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:46.000
in terms of different n
values that we end in.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.930
So we talked about what we could
see with visible light,

00:39:48.930 --> 00:39:51.250
we said that's actually
the Balmer series.

00:39:51.250 --> 00:39:54.750
So anything that goes from a
higher energy level to 2 is

00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.960
going to be falling within the
Balmer series, which is in the

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:00.610
visible range of the spectrum.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:03.830
We can think about the Lyman
series, which is

00:40:03.830 --> 00:40:05.280
where n equals 1.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.570
We know that that's going to be
a higher energy difference,

00:40:08.570 --> 00:40:12.660
so that means that we're going
to be in the UV range.

00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:15.140
We can also go in the
opposite direction.

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:18.690
So, for example, when n equals
3, that's called the Paschen

00:40:18.690 --> 00:40:21.430
series, and these are named
after basically the people

00:40:21.430 --> 00:40:24.650
that first discovered these
different lines and

00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:27.790
characterized them, and this
is in the near IR range.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:31.680
And again, the n equals 4 is
the Brackett series, and

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:33.270
that's an IR range.

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:36.530
I think there's names for even
a few more levels up.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:39.370
You don't need to know those,
but just because it's a

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:41.880
special case with the hydrogen
atom, they do tend to be named

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:44.970
-- the most important, of
course, tends to be the Balmer

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:47.670
series because that's what we
can actually see being emitted

00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:51.060
from the hydrogen atom.

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:55.900
So, now we should be able to
relate what we know about

00:40:55.900 --> 00:41:00.220
different frequencies and
different wavelengths, so

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:06.190
Darcy can you switch us over
to a clicker question here?

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:09.940
And we can also talk about the
difference between what's

00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:13.110
happening when we have emission,
and we're going to

00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:14.190
switch over to absorption.

00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:17.850
So, we just talked about
emission, so before we head

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.360
into absorption, if you can
answer this clicker question

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.580
in terms of what do you think
absorption means having just

00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:27.610
discussed hydrogen
emission here?

00:41:27.610 --> 00:41:31.030
So we have four choices in terms
of initial and final

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:33.276
energy levels, and also what
it means in terms of the

00:41:33.276 --> 00:41:36.320
electron -- whether it's gaining
energy or whether it's

00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.940
going to be emitting energy?

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:42.440
So, why do you take 10 seconds
on that, we'll

00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:54.500
make it a quick one.

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:55.100
All right, great.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.510
So already just from knowing
the emission part, we can

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:00.470
figure out what absorption
probably means.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:03.590
Absorption is just the opposite
of emission, so

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:10.220
instead of starting at a high
energy level and dropping

00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:13.800
down, when we absorb light we
start low and we absorb energy

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:17.750
to bring ourselves up to an
n final that's higher.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.100
And instead of having the
electron giving off energy as

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.920
a photon, instead now the
electron is going to take in

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:29.800
energy from light and move
up to that higher level.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.390
So now we're going to be talking
briefly about photon

00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:33.780
absorption here.

00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:37.260
So again, this is just stating
the same thing, and it could

00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:40.880
take in a long wavelength light,
which would give it

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:43.980
just a little bit of energy,
maybe just enough to head up

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:48.550
one energy level or two, or we
could take in a high energy

00:42:48.550 --> 00:42:51.800
photon, and that means that the
electron is going to get

00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:56.690
to move up to an even
higher energy level.

00:42:56.690 --> 00:43:00.110
And again, we can talk about the
same relationship here, so

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:02.670
it's a very similar equation to
the Rydberg equation that

00:43:02.670 --> 00:43:06.450
we saw earlier, except now what
you see is the n initial

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:08.810
and the n final are
swapped places.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.620
So instead now we have r h over
Planck's constant times 1

00:43:12.620 --> 00:43:17.470
over n initial squared minus
n final squared.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:20.570
And what you want to keep in
mind is that whatever you're

00:43:20.570 --> 00:43:23.230
dealing with, whether it's
absorption or emission, the

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.340
frequency of the light is always
going to be a positive

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.760
number, so you always want to
make sure what's inside these

00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.780
brackets here turns out
to be positive.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.540
So that's just a little bit of
a check for yourself, and it

00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.080
should make sense because what
you're doing is you're

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:39.160
calculating the difference
between energy levels, so you

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.620
just need to flip around which
you put first to end up with a

00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:44.770
positive number here, and that's
a little bit of a check

00:43:44.770 --> 00:43:48.250
that you can do what yourself.

00:43:48.250 --> 00:43:51.300
So let's do a sample calculation
now using this

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:55.050
Rydberg formula, and we'll
switch back to emission, and

00:43:55.050 --> 00:43:57.490
the reason that we'll do that is
because it would be nice to

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:01.450
actually approve what we just
saw here and calculate the

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:04.140
frequency of one of our lines
in the wavelength of one of

00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.850
the lines we saw.

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:09.340
So what we'll do is this problem
here, which is let's

00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:11.870
calculate out what the
wavelength of radiation would

00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:16.520
be emitted from a hydrogen
atom if we start at the n

00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:22.750
equals 3 level and we go down
to the n equals 2 level.

00:44:22.750 --> 00:44:29.990
So what we need to do here is
use the Rydberg formula, and

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:32.670
actually you'll be given the
Rydberg formulas in both

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.530
forms, both or absorption and
emission on the exams. if you

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:41.020
don't want to use that, you can
also derive it as we did

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:42.950
every time, it should
intuitively make

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:44.360
sense how we got there.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.010
But the exams are pretty short,
so we don't want you

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.420
doing that every time, so we'll
save the 2 minutes and

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:51.230
give you the equations directly,
but it's still

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.980
important to know
how to use them.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:56.980
So, we can get from these
energy differences to

00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:02.730
frequency by frequency is equal
to r sub h over Planck's

00:45:02.730 --> 00:45:07.960
constant times 1 over n
final squared minus 1

00:45:07.960 --> 00:45:12.710
over n initial squared.

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:16.090
So let's actually just simplify
this to the other

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:17.970
version of the Rydberg
constant, since we

00:45:17.970 --> 00:45:19.300
can use that here.

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:23.500
So kind of that strange cursive
r, and our n final is

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:30.830
2, so 1 over 2 squared minus n
initial, so 1 over 3 squared.

00:45:30.830 --> 00:45:35.660
So, our frequency of light
is going to be equal to r

00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:40.980
times 5 over 36.

00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.790
But when we were actually
looking at our different

00:45:43.790 --> 00:45:46.630
wavelengths, what we associate
mostly with color is the wave

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:49.770
length of the light and not the
frequency of the light, so

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:52.110
let's look at wavelength
instead.

00:45:52.110 --> 00:45:57.100
We know that wavelength
is equal to c over nu.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:02.140
We can plug in what we have
for nu, so we have 36 c

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:08.360
divided by 5, and that cursivey
Rydberg constant, and

00:46:08.360 --> 00:46:12.540
that gives us 36 times the
speed of light, 2 .

00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:23.500
998 times 10 the 8 meters per
second, all over 5 times 3 .

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:31.400
29 times 10 to the
15 per second.

00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:34.570
So, what we end up getting when
we do this calculation is

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:39.070
the wavelength of light,
which is equal to 6 .

00:46:39.070 --> 00:46:45.130
57 times 10 to the negative 7
meters, or if we convert that

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:49.580
to nanometers, we have
657 nanometers.

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:52.560
So does anyone remember what
range of light 657

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:55.390
nanometers falls in?

00:46:55.390 --> 00:46:56.080
What color?

00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:57.370
STUDENT: Red.

00:46:57.370 --> 00:46:59.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it's
in the red range.

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:00.430
So that's promising.

00:47:00.430 --> 00:47:05.050
We did, in fact, see red in our
spectrum, and it turns out

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:07.970
that that's exactly the
wavelength that we see is that

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:10.790
we're at 657 nanometers.

00:47:10.790 --> 00:47:15.330
So it turns out that we can, in
fact, use the energy levels

00:47:15.330 --> 00:47:18.290
to predict, and we could if we
wanted to do them for all of

00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:20.650
the different wavelengths of
light that we observed, and

00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.390
also all the different
wavelengths of light that can

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:26.810
be detected, even if we
can't observe them.

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.490
All right, so that's what we're
going to cover in terms

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:32.290
of the energy portion of the
Schrodinger equation.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:36.400
I mentioned that we can also
solve for psi here, which is

00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.700
the wave function, and we're
running a little short on

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:42.880
time, so we'll start on
Monday with solving

00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.670
for the wave function.

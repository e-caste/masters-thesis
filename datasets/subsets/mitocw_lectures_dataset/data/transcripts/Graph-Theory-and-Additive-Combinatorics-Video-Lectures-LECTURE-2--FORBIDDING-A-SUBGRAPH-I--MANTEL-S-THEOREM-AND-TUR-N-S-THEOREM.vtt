WEBVTT

00:00:19.088 --> 00:00:20.630
YUFEI ZHAO: So the
first topic that I

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.280
want to discuss in this course
is extremal graph theory.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.220
And in particular,
there is a whole class

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.690
of problems which have to do
with what happens if you forbid

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:47.750
a specific subgraph.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.400
Forbid a specific subgraph.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.400
And I ask you, what's the
maximum number of edges

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.330
that can appear in your graph?

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.129
In particular, and
this is the question

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.700
that we saw at the
end of last lecture,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.070
which, now we're going to
pretend that's a theorem.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.510
Mantel's theorem
essentially asks,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.720
if you know that your graph
has no triangles, what's

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.770
the maximum number
of edges it can have?

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.880
And Mantel's theorem tells
us that the extremal example

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.940
is when your graph
consists of putting

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.580
half the vertices
on one side, half

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.220
the vertices on the
other side, and putting

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.350
in all the edges
between the two sides.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.490
So this is a complete
bipartite graph.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.920
For these partitions, we denote
complete bipartite graphs

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.980
like that.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.870
And Mantel's theorem
tells us that this graph,

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.820
among triangle-free graphs,
has the most number of edges.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:21.740
Triangle-free graph, n
vertices, has at most--

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.745
so the number of edges there
is n squared divided by 4.

00:02:26.745 --> 00:02:32.340
Round down-- that many edges.

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.800
And from this example,
this bound is tight.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.260
So Mantel's theorem
them gives us

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.620
a completely satisfactory
answer to the question of,

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.630
what's the maximum
number of edges

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.755
in a graph without triangles?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.500
And I want to begin by showing
you a few different proofs

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.760
of Mantel's theorem.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.430
So we're illustrating
some different techniques

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.870
in graph theory.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.890
So we'll see quite a few
proofs in today's lecture.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.010
The first one begins--

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.990
well, here's the setup.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.660
I have G, an n vertex graph.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:17.190
And let me denote the vertices
and edges of G by V and E.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.040
If I have an edge in G
between vertices x and y,

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.922
then note that they cannot
have any common neighbors.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.040
Because if they did, I
would see a triangle.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.039
So I assume G is triangle-free.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.190
So what can we say about
the degrees of the two

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.830
endpoints of this edge?

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.746
Well, they cannot add up to?

00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:57.783
AUDIENCE: They can't
have more than n.

00:03:57.783 --> 00:03:59.700
YUFEI ZHAO: They cannot
add up to more than n.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.750
So in particular-- so exactly.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.050
So the degrees of
these two endpoints,

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.450
there's at most n
whenever xy is an edge.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.240
So here I'm using
d to denote degree.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:19.950
Well, OK.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.060
So now let me consider
the quantity which is

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.995
the sum of the squared degrees.

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:37.400
On one hand, I claim that the
sum is equal to this quantity

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.280
here, where I sum
over all edges.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.580
And the reason is,
well, look at the sum.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.010
Suppose, imagine writing
out all the sum n's.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.632
How many times does
each dx come up?

00:04:51.632 --> 00:04:59.800
So each dx appears one
for each edge x is in,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.820
so appears exactly dx times.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:14.120
But we saw from up here that
each sum n is at most n.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.710
So this sum here
is that most mn.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:25.010
On the other hand, let's
consider the quantity which

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.465
is just the sum of the degrees.

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.950
And you sometimes know it
as the handshaking lemma,

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.210
that the sums of the degrees is
just twice the number of edges.

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.840
Each edge is considered
twice in the sum.

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.130
Well, now we apply the
Cauchy-Schwarz inequality,

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.980
which, as you'll see many
times in this course,

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:52.080
although you might think of it
as a fairly simple inequality,

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.240
it's extremely powerful.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.925
And it will come up pretty
much throughout this course.

00:05:57.925 --> 00:05:59.300
By the Cauchy-Schwarz
inequality,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.020
you compare these
two quantities.

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:15.130
I find that we have this
inequality over here relating

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:18.490
the sums of the
degrees and square

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.300
of the sum of the degrees.

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:30.170
But we saw, on one hand, the
left-hand side is 4m squared.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.370
And we also saw that
the right-hand side

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.870
is at most mn squared.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.850
Putting them together, we see
that m is at most n squared

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:45.540
over 4.

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.510
And of course, because
it's an integer,

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:50.920
it's at most the
floor of this number.

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.400
And that's a proof
of Mantel's theorem.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:05.090
What can you tell me about the
equality case in this proof?

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:13.220
So I'll let you
think about that.

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.930
But let me show you
some other proofs.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.970
In other words, are there
graphs with the same number

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:25.820
of edges as the graph
shown up there that

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.840
is also triangle-free?

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:27.980
Is that a unique example?

00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:33.840
So let me show you a different
proof of Mantel's theorem.

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.260
In this proof, so
we begin with a step

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:43.090
that seems a little tricky.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:48.960
Let's let A be a
subset of vertices such

00:07:48.960 --> 00:08:01.426
that A is a largest
independent set of G.

00:08:01.426 --> 00:08:04.010
So remember, independent
set is a subset of vertices

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.890
with no edges inside.

00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:09.770
It may have many
independent sets all having

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.360
the same maximum size.

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:14.120
Take one of them.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.930
So why should you do this step?

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.650
Well, you know,
sometimes magic happens.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.280
Let's consider some vertex.

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.440
So consider some
vertex, let's say x,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.809
and look at its neighborhood.

00:08:32.809 --> 00:08:36.400
The neighborhood must
be an independent set.

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.870
Otherwise, I get a triangle.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:46.780
So every neighborhood
is an independent set.

00:08:49.910 --> 00:08:53.740
And as a result, the
degree of every vertex

00:08:53.740 --> 00:08:58.010
is at most the size of the
largest independent set.

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:23.950
So now, let B be the complement
of A. So I have this A and B.

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.180
Every edge has to intersect
B. The edge cannot be entirely

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:30.010
containing A, because
it has no edges.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:48.090
So the number of edges
of G is at most--

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:55.140
well, I count over the
vertices in B, the degree.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:56.690
So maybe I overcount.

00:09:56.690 --> 00:10:00.020
So the edges containing B, I
count twice, but that's OK.

00:10:00.020 --> 00:10:03.550
So this is an upper bound
on the number of edges.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.920
But I also know that
every vertex in the graph

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.490
has a degree at
most the size of A.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:15.270
So each sum n is at most the
size of A. And I have B terms.

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.440
So I have that.

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:31.240
Now, by the AMGM inequality,
you'll have that.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.410
And the sizes of A and B
add up to the entire vertex

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:42.322
set, n squared over 4.

00:10:42.322 --> 00:10:46.180
So that gives you another
proof of Mantel's theorem.

00:10:48.910 --> 00:10:51.940
What does this proof tell
us about the equality case?

00:10:55.876 --> 00:10:58.710
Now, something I always want
you to keep in mind when

00:10:58.710 --> 00:11:00.870
we do proofs is,
especially if we

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.660
have a tight example like that--
and later on in the course,

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:05.970
we'll almost never have
good examples like that.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:08.100
So this is still early
on in the course.

00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.530
And we're still very clean
in the examples-- is to keep

00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:12.960
the extremal example in mind.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.140
And every step in
your proof, it should

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:18.180
be tight for that example.

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.050
Otherwise, something went
wrong with your proof.

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.860
Let's think about
the inequalities.

00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:33.690
At equality, we must have that--

00:11:33.690 --> 00:11:38.430
so looking at this inequality.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:49.595
So there are no edges in
B. We also have that--

00:11:52.385 --> 00:12:07.290
so by that, so every vertex in
B is complete to A. And finally,

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.180
A and B should
have the same size.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:15.270
So it is exactly the
configuration shown up there.

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:18.790
Now, when n is odd,
we're rounding down by 1.

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.580
So you can lose a little bit.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.870
But you can check
that actually what

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:25.420
we described up there is
also the unique example.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.380
So that graph, the
complete bipartite graph

00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:35.530
with two equal parts, is
the unique maximal example,

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:37.770
number of edges in a
triangle-free graph.

00:12:42.216 --> 00:12:43.210
Great.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:45.970
So once we know
what the answer is

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:49.240
for triangle-free, of course,
we should ask further questions.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:50.950
Instead of forbidding
a triangle,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.520
what if we forbid other graphs?

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.570
And what are some natural
next steps to take?

00:12:57.570 --> 00:13:01.690
Well, say, instead of triangles,
we can ask, what about if we

00:13:01.690 --> 00:13:06.550
forbid a K4, a clique
of four vertices?

00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:10.240
Or in general, what if we
forbid a clique on the fixed

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.170
number of vertices?

00:13:11.170 --> 00:13:20.450
So what is the maximum number
of edges in a Kr plus 1-free--

00:13:20.450 --> 00:13:24.080
there's a good reason
why index is r plus 1--

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:28.670
graph on n vertices.

00:13:28.670 --> 00:13:31.850
So for example, if we're
interested in K4-free--

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:40.830
so what might be a good
candidate for a graph with lots

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:42.790
of edges that has no K4's?

00:13:42.790 --> 00:13:44.610
I mean, certainly,
that example we saw,

00:13:44.610 --> 00:13:47.540
it does not have K4's, because
it doesn't have any triangles.

00:13:47.540 --> 00:13:50.820
But we can do even better.

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.860
Instead of taking two parts,
you can take more parts.

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.450
For K4, if I take
three parts, each

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.910
with n/3 number of
vertices, of course,

00:14:03.910 --> 00:14:07.020
if n is not divisible by
3, round up and run down.

00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:13.680
And putting all the edges
between different parts,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:15.900
you can see this
graph here has no K4.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.210
So that's an example
of a K4-free graph.

00:14:22.210 --> 00:14:25.670
Well, does it have the maximum
possible number of edges?

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:28.270
So is this the best
that we can do?

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.220
So it turns out
the answer is yes.

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.820
And that's the next
theorem that we'll see.

00:14:32.820 --> 00:14:36.130
But just to give it a name, so
we're going to call graphs like

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:38.010
these Turán graphs.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:40.735
So the next theorem
is proved by Turán.

00:14:40.735 --> 00:14:42.100
It's Turán's theorem.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:48.940
So a Turán graph, so
we'll denote T sub nr.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:59.450
It is a complete
r-partite graph such

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:06.250
that there are n
vertices whose part sizes

00:15:06.250 --> 00:15:12.289
are all nearly the same,
up to at most 1 difference.

00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:19.930
So this is an example here.

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:25.770
But in general, maybe
you have r parts.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:38.780
And I put in all the edges
between different parts.

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.940
So it's not too hard to
calculate the number of edges

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.470
in such a graph.

00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:50.470
And Turán's theorem tells
us that that is the extremal

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:51.620
example.

00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:55.720
You cannot do better in
terms of getting more edges.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:15.950
So if G is an n vertex, try
a K sub r plus 1-free graph.

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:28.170
Then it has at most the number
of edges of the Turán graph.

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:38.360
It's a generalization
of Mantel's theorem.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:42.350
And well, you can think about
if the proofs that we did

00:16:42.350 --> 00:16:46.310
for Mantel's generalizes
to Turán's theorem.

00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:50.360
And it's actually not
entirely clear how to do it.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:53.390
So let me present for you
three different proofs

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:55.598
of Turán's theorem.

00:16:55.598 --> 00:16:57.140
So some of them,
you can think about,

00:16:57.140 --> 00:16:59.240
are they related to the
proofs of Mantel's theorem

00:16:59.240 --> 00:16:59.740
that we did?

00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:02.930
And they all are going to look
somewhat different, but maybe

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:06.280
superficially.

00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:13.930
The first proof, we
will use induction

00:17:13.930 --> 00:17:15.299
on the number of vertices.

00:17:18.250 --> 00:17:21.089
So actually, this is one of the
very few times in this course

00:17:21.089 --> 00:17:23.212
where we will see induction.

00:17:23.212 --> 00:17:25.170
So of course, induction
is a powerful technique

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:25.920
in combinatorics.

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.000
But for almost the
rest of the course,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.030
we're not going to
have clean examples.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.280
And when we do have clean
examples to work with,

00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:36.640
somehow increasing n by 1
doesn't buy you all that much.

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:40.020
Here, there are very clean
examples, very clean answers,

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.360
and induction works
out quite well.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.130
When n is small, of course,
you should always address that.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.600
You can come up with
many funny proofs

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.142
if you don't address
when n is small.

00:17:51.142 --> 00:17:55.840
So when n is small, this
problem is basically trivial.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.310
n is almost r.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:18:01.210
You could have the complete
graph on r vertices.

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:03.350
And then we're good.

00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:10.090
So let's assume that
we're not in this case.

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:11.810
And also, by
induction hypothesis,

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:19.345
let's assume that it is true
for all graphs fewer than n

00:18:19.345 --> 00:18:19.845
vertices.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:31.830
And let G be a graph
that is K sub r

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:36.990
plus 1-free on n vertices.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:41.800
And also, let's assume a
maximum example to begin with.

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.610
So let's assume that
the G that you chose

00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:50.350
has already the maximum
possible number of edges.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:52.310
There are only finite
of any such examples.

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:55.230
So pick one that already has
the maximum number of edges.

00:18:55.230 --> 00:18:59.190
And let's think about what
properties this graph G has.

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:08.460
I claim that G must already
contain a clique on r vertices.

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:14.390
So think about that.

00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:18.290
If G does not contain
a clique on r vertices,

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:20.240
then I can add in more edges.

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:34.100
And I can still
maintain the property

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.960
of being K sub r plus 1-free.

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.320
So I can assume that G
must contain a K sub r.

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:48.320
So let's look at one
of these K sub r's.

00:19:48.320 --> 00:20:04.200
So let n be the vertices
of some r clique in G.

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:12.420
So we have some A. And
the complement to that,

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:21.490
let me call that B.

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:28.940
Look at the vertex in B. How
many neighbors can have in A?

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.730
It cannot be complete to A,
otherwise I would have an r

00:20:32.730 --> 00:20:34.610
plus 1 clique.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:51.200
So every vertex in B has at
most r minus 1 neighbors in A.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:53.700
So let's count all the edges.

00:20:56.640 --> 00:21:00.530
The number of edges
in G is that most--

00:21:00.530 --> 00:21:04.070
well, first, we should account
for the edges inside A.

00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:08.730
And there are-- or
choose two of them.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.080
And then the edges between
A and B, for every vertex

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:19.050
in B, there are at most
r minus 1 vertices going

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:32.650
to A for each vertex in B. And
finally, the edge set of B.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:38.060
Well, we can say something
more about these quantities.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:42.740
We know that the size of
B is exactly n minus r.

00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:49.060
But what can we say about
the number of edges in B?

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:51.450
We can use induction hypothesis.

00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:55.990
So B is also r
plus 1 clique-free.

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:59.080
So the number of edges is
at most the number of edges

00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:02.920
in a corresponding Turán graph.

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.880
Now, at this point, you
can do a calculation.

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:08.100
Well, I mean, you should
expect that the answer

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.680
we're looking for is--

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:13.350
I mean, this should be
equal to the number of edges

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:14.430
in the Turán graph.

00:22:14.430 --> 00:22:16.410
So you can either
do a calculation

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:18.630
to figure this out,
or remember what

00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:23.400
I said earlier, that keep
the tight example in mind,

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.640
and everything should check
out for the tight example.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.570
So in particular, if
you are in the situation

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:37.750
of a complete multipartite
graph with equal size or nearly

00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:42.540
equal-size parts, what is A?

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:52.740
So A is one vertex
from each part.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.560
So you take out one
vertex from each part.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:07.610
And read off this calculation
for this graph over here.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:10.042
And then you see that
that is indeed equality.

00:23:10.042 --> 00:23:11.000
So it should check out.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.824
You don't need to do
any actual calculations.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.890
Any questions about the
proofs we've done so far?

00:23:25.285 --> 00:23:28.200
All right.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:31.140
Let me show you another
proof of Turán's theorem.

00:23:39.390 --> 00:23:43.970
So this proof has a name.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.552
So it's called Zykov's
symmetrization.

00:23:55.408 --> 00:23:58.020
So Zykov has the
unfortunate honor

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.120
of having a name
that's hard to beat

00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:02.320
in terms of alphabetical order.

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.180
I think, if he and I
were to write a paper,

00:24:04.180 --> 00:24:05.430
I wouldn't be the last author.

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:12.550
So what's this about?

00:24:12.550 --> 00:24:16.930
So let G be the graph.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.690
Again, as before, we're going
to take a maximal example.

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:30.810
So be the n-vertex graph
that is free of cliques

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:35.790
of r plus 1 vertices and has
already the maximum number

00:24:35.790 --> 00:24:36.400
of edges.

00:24:44.410 --> 00:24:46.850
So here's the property I want
to prove about this graph.

00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:55.240
I claim that if you look at
the complement of the graph,

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.980
of this extremal
example, it must

00:24:57.980 --> 00:25:00.230
be an equivalence relation.

00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:07.970
So more precisely, claim
that if xy is a non-edge,

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:19.650
and yz is a non-edge, then
xz must also be a non-edge.

00:25:19.650 --> 00:25:27.270
So in other words, non-edges
form equivalence relation.

00:25:34.973 --> 00:25:36.390
And again, you
should always think

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.390
about the extremal example.

00:25:39.390 --> 00:25:41.330
And it is true for
the extremal example.

00:25:41.330 --> 00:25:44.005
Because the complement
are a bunch of cliques.

00:25:44.005 --> 00:25:45.380
So it is an
equivalence relation.

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:53.310
So let's prove this claim.

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:57.240
So let's assume that the
conclusion is not true.

00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:06.240
So suppose, for the contrary,
that we have xy and yz being

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:12.000
non-edges, but xz is an edge.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:26.580
So let's think
about what happens

00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:32.210
to the degrees of
non-adjacent vertices.

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:36.710
So I claim that
if the degree of y

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:40.920
were smaller than
the degree of x, then

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:42.880
I can do something
to the graph that

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:47.150
violates the maximality
of the number of edges.

00:26:47.150 --> 00:26:59.250
Namely, I can replace
y by a clone of x.

00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:05.230
So I chop off y from the graph.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.550
And I look at x.

00:27:06.550 --> 00:27:07.990
And I clone.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:12.100
So cloning it means
taking some x prime.

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:17.500
And I join x prime to all
the same neighbors as x.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.790
So clone x into some
other vertex, x prime.

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:24.430
Now, when you do this,
I claim that you also

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:30.820
get a graph that is
free of K sub r plus 1.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:41.630
So we also obtain a K
sub r plus 1-free graph.

00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:46.325
So why is that?

00:27:46.325 --> 00:27:50.710
So if you were to have
an r plus 1 clique,

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:54.510
well, it shouldn't have
both x and x clone.

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.410
Because there's no
edge between them.

00:27:56.410 --> 00:27:59.468
So it only has one
of x and x clone.

00:27:59.468 --> 00:28:02.010
But then that would have been
a clique in the original graph.

00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:12.460
However, what about
the number of edges

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:16.300
that we obtain after
this transformation?

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:20.800
If x had more outgoing
edges, a higher degree

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.790
than y, then cloning
x to replace y

00:28:24.790 --> 00:28:26.500
increases the number of edges.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.780
We obtain a graph that is
also K sub r plus 1-free

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:45.820
and has more edges than
G, which is not possible,

00:28:45.820 --> 00:28:49.180
because we assumed that g
started with the maximum number

00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.163
of edges.

00:28:51.163 --> 00:29:00.600
So therefore, the degree of y is
at most the degree x, basically

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:05.520
for every non-edge xy.

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:12.080
Likewise, we also
have that there

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.840
is no edge between y and z.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.400
So the degree of y is--

00:29:23.712 --> 00:29:25.920
thus the degree of y is at
least the degree of x now.

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.748
So degree of y is at
least the degree of z.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:38.910
Now, y has a lot
of outgoing edges.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:44.160
So now let's replace both
x and z by clones of y.

00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:02.650
As before, we obtain some
graph that we'll call G prime.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:07.600
And G prime, same reason as
before, is K sub r plus 1-free.

00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.100
If you had a K sub r plus
1, then the same clique

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.390
should have shown up in
G. So G prime does not

00:30:16.390 --> 00:30:18.130
have r plus 1 cliques either.

00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:20.960
But what about the number
of edges in G prime?

00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.490
So the number of
edges in G prime--

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:34.320
well, we started with
G. We deleted x and z.

00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:42.170
So we deleted this many edges.

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.730
Here, we're crucially
using the fact

00:30:43.730 --> 00:30:47.260
that there is an
edge between x and z.

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:51.160
But now we also added
back in a bunch of edges

00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.320
coming from the clone of y.

00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:59.482
And they are 2 times
dy edges added back in.

00:30:59.482 --> 00:31:02.240
Now, you see, because y
has degree at least that

00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:06.680
of both x and z, we obtain
that this number of edges

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:13.010
is strictly bigger than
that of G, which contradicts

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:29.080
the maximality of G.

00:31:29.080 --> 00:31:32.410
So at this point, we know
that the complement of G

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:35.390
must be an equivalence relation.

00:31:35.390 --> 00:31:38.910
So the complement is
a bunch of cliques.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:40.613
And that's a lot of information.

00:31:40.613 --> 00:31:42.030
So that's almost
the best thing we

00:31:42.030 --> 00:31:43.822
can hope for is the
structural information.

00:31:43.822 --> 00:31:46.510
We're not quite done yet.

00:31:46.510 --> 00:31:47.220
And why is that?

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.962
Well, we're almost there.

00:31:52.962 --> 00:31:54.170
But we're not quite done yet.

00:31:57.128 --> 00:32:00.086
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
you can figure out

00:32:00.086 --> 00:32:02.155
the sizes [INAUDIBLE].

00:32:02.155 --> 00:32:02.780
YUFEI ZHAO: OK.

00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:08.590
So we need to figure out the
sizes of the individual parts.

00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:11.390
So we need to figure out the
sizes of individual parts.

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:15.610
And also, note that you
cannot have too many parts.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:20.950
So at this point,
after the claim,

00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:28.210
we know that G is a
complete multipartite graph.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:43.130
It has at most r parts.

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:45.710
If it had r plus 1 parts,
I would see a clique

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:46.745
in r plus 1 vertices.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:53.665
So then, finally,
I need to show--

00:32:53.665 --> 00:32:55.390
I mean, the rest
is fairly routine.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:58.540
I need to show what
the part sizes have

00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:01.180
to be to maximize
the number of edges.

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.535
And basically, if you
had some two parts--

00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.690
so consider exactly r parts.

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.090
They're all empty parts.

00:33:10.090 --> 00:33:12.780
And some two parts
have the number

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:23.390
of vertices differing
by more than 1.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:27.350
Then what I can do is--

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:32.956
so if you had one part much
bigger than the other part,

00:33:32.956 --> 00:33:36.730
you can imagine moving
one vertex from one part

00:33:36.730 --> 00:33:38.690
to the other part.

00:33:38.690 --> 00:33:41.540
And you should convince yourself
that this operation should

00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:44.270
strictly increase
the number of edges.

00:33:50.520 --> 00:34:01.700
And then moving vertices
should strictly increase

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:04.960
the number of edges of G.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.720
And putting this
all together, we

00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:09.840
see that the extremal
example necessarily

00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:14.070
has to be the
current graph, namely

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:19.630
a complete r-partite
graph, where

00:34:19.630 --> 00:34:22.860
all the parts have
the same size, up

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:24.456
to almost 1 difference.

00:34:29.126 --> 00:34:30.540
Great.

00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:33.030
Any questions?

00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.530
Yep?

00:34:33.530 --> 00:34:35.530
AUDIENCE: Can the Zykov
symmetrization technique

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:37.649
be used for any other
type of problem?

00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.960
YUFEI ZHAO: So the question is,
can the Zykov symmetrization

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:46.715
technique be used for any
other types of problem?

00:34:46.715 --> 00:34:48.090
I do have something
else in mind.

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.839
But I don't want
to discuss it now.

00:34:52.719 --> 00:34:54.098
Any more questions?

00:34:58.082 --> 00:34:59.078
Great.

00:34:59.078 --> 00:35:03.180
And you see that in both proofs,
if you look at this proof

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.100
as well, you see
that the Turán graph,

00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:09.370
it's the unique extremizer.

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:12.250
I want to give you a
third proof that has

00:35:12.250 --> 00:35:13.730
a somewhat different flavor.

00:35:13.730 --> 00:35:16.000
So these two proofs,
they're both somewhat

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.265
combinatorial in flavor.

00:35:17.265 --> 00:35:22.340
So I'm doing some arguments
either looking at,

00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:24.730
in this case, a
clique and arguing

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:26.050
what happens outside of it.

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:29.230
And over there, again, I'm
looking at maximal example.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:30.910
The third proof
I want to show is

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:32.770
more of a probabilistic proof.

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.485
So this highlights an important
method in combinatorics,

00:35:35.485 --> 00:35:39.280
and almost a
probabilistic method,

00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:43.550
where we start with a problem
that comes with no randomness.

00:35:43.550 --> 00:35:48.920
But we introduce some randomness
to make the problem amenable.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:50.120
It's a very pretty idea.

00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:11.240
So we start, again, with G being
a n-uniform, so n-vertex, K sub

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:17.520
r plus 1-free graph on m edges.

00:36:20.532 --> 00:36:25.700
And what I want to do is to
randomly sort the vertex set.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:36.400
Consider a random
order of the vertices.

00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:45.030
So I put all the
vertices on the line,

00:36:45.030 --> 00:36:47.610
but the vertices are
chosen at random order.

00:36:47.610 --> 00:36:53.574
And you see some of
the edges like that.

00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.070
Let me show you how
to find a clique.

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:07.810
And essentially, we do
it in a not-so-smart way.

00:37:07.810 --> 00:37:11.620
Namely, I basically
pick all the vertices

00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:13.870
in some greedy-like
manner, where

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:16.540
I include the vertex
in my set if it

00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:23.720
is adjacent to all
earlier vertices.

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:28.730
So if all of its neighbors--

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:35.090
so I include V, if
V is the earliest

00:37:35.090 --> 00:37:38.138
vertex among its neighbors.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:49.590
So earliest means the leftmost,
so if I go from left to right.

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:54.680
So in this case up here, so
I look at the first vertex.

00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.335
Well, the first vertex
should always be in your set.

00:37:58.335 --> 00:38:01.440
So this vertex has one
neighbor, just to the right.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.600
So that's OK.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:09.350
And hold on.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:11.930
It's-- no.

00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:12.640
Sorry.

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:16.250
That's not what I want to do.

00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:20.390
Sorry.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:25.320
So I actually do mean what I was
going to write down initially.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:41.975
So if V is adjacent to
all the earlier vertices

00:38:41.975 --> 00:38:42.600
in this order--

00:38:54.450 --> 00:39:00.090
so for example, this
vertex, it's OK.

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:04.230
And I'm also going to
include this vertex here,

00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:12.150
because both of its
earlier vertices are in--

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:16.350
both the earlier vertices are
adjacent to the third vertex.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:18.020
And I think that's it.

00:39:20.882 --> 00:39:25.160
Now, this set x, I
claim two things.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:29.490
One, that x has to be a clique.

00:39:29.490 --> 00:39:34.050
So claim that x
has to be a clique.

00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:41.200
Because every vertex in
the x is adjacent to all

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.540
of the [INAUDIBLE]
vertices in particular.

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:48.480
All the vertices in x
are joined to each other.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:54.930
On the other hand, how big is
x, at least in expectation?

00:39:54.930 --> 00:40:05.202
So for every vertex, I want
to understand the probability

00:40:05.202 --> 00:40:10.630
that this v is included in x.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.790
So v has a bunch
of non-neighbors.

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:19.880
And the property of
v being included in x

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:24.660
is that all of its
non-neighbors appear after v.

00:40:24.660 --> 00:40:31.350
So the probability that v,
little v, is in the set x

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:37.740
is equal to the
probability that v appears

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:42.210
before all its non-neighbors.

00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:55.720
All v and its non-neighbors,
they're sorted uniformly.

00:40:55.720 --> 00:41:04.300
So the probability that this
occurs is exactly 1 over 1

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.190
plus the number
of non-neighbors,

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.320
which is n minus the degree of.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:28.980
Well, we know that
this graph G has

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.950
no cliques of size r plus 1.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:40.720
So if we consider the expected
number of the size of x,

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:43.600
on one hand, it is at most r.

00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:48.610
Because G K sub r plus 1-free.

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:52.810
On the other hand, by
linearity of expectations,

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.330
each vertex is included
with some probability.

00:41:55.330 --> 00:41:58.340
So the size of x in
expectation is just

00:41:58.340 --> 00:42:05.650
a sum of all of these individual
inclusion probabilities, which

00:42:05.650 --> 00:42:18.480
individually we've
computed above like that.

00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:23.190
Now, by convexity,
I can conclude

00:42:23.190 --> 00:42:28.410
that this quantity, this sum
here, is at least the quantity

00:42:28.410 --> 00:42:31.620
that would have been obtained
if all the decrease were

00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.490
equal to each other.

00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.700
And if you rearrange this
equation, this inequality,

00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:46.370
we obtain that an m
is at most 1 minus 1

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:51.740
over r times n squared over 2.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.620
And if you compare this
number to the number of edges

00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:59.610
in the Turán graph, so you
see that this is basically

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:07.300
the number of edges, and this
gives you a proof if n is

00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:13.810
divisible by r.

00:43:13.810 --> 00:43:17.710
And in fact, the number of edges
in the Turán graph is exactly

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:22.190
this number here, if this
divisibility condition is true.

00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:24.940
If it's not, you need to
do a little bit more work.

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:29.040
Because we were a little
bit lost here in this step.

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:31.570
So you should see that
this quantity here

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:35.535
is minimized when all
the degrees are roughly

00:43:35.535 --> 00:43:36.910
equal to each
other, and you make

00:43:36.910 --> 00:43:39.250
them as close to each
other as possible.

00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:45.430
So with a little bit more work,
you can get the exact version

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:46.740
of Turán's theorem up there.

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:50.160
But at least what
we've shown is--

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:58.000
so from here, we've shown that
the number of edges is at most

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.950
this quantity, which,
for most purposes,

00:43:59.950 --> 00:44:01.997
is basically as good
as Turán's theorem.

00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:08.470
Any questions about
this proof here?

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:11.046
And so it's a probabilistic
method of proof.

00:44:11.046 --> 00:44:13.600
So we're introducing
some randomness

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.298
into the problem that
originally had no randomness.

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:20.010
Great.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:22.500
So let's take a very
quick 2-minute break.

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:26.150
And then when we come back,
I want to show you that even

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:27.977
though we've shown so
many different proofs

00:44:27.977 --> 00:44:30.560
of Turán's theorem and Mantel's
theorem-- you might think, OK,

00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:32.900
this is a pretty simple thing--

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:36.075
even if I tweak the
problem just a little bit,

00:44:36.075 --> 00:44:38.200
there are so many things
that we do not understand,

00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.460
and many important open problems
in combinatorics that are

00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:44.743
variants of Turán's theorem.

00:44:44.743 --> 00:44:45.910
So let's take a quick break.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.930
So so far we've been talking
about Turán's theorem,

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:59.830
or generally the problem of, if
you forbid a certain structure,

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:05.730
forbid a certain subgraph, what
is the maximum number of edges?

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:07.970
We're going to spend the
next few lectures discussing

00:45:07.970 --> 00:45:09.480
more problems of that form.

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:13.520
And it turns out, for the
answers we've just seen,

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:15.300
they are deceptively simple.

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.690
And for almost any
other situation,

00:45:17.690 --> 00:45:20.340
we don't really know
the exact answer.

00:45:20.340 --> 00:45:22.910
And for many questions, we
don't know anything close

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:24.038
to the truth.

00:45:24.038 --> 00:45:25.580
And in particular,
I want to show you

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:29.000
one variant of this
problem, namely

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.640
what happens, instead
of looking at graphs,

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.640
if you look at hypergraphs.

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.860
And there, that's a major
open problem in combinatorics,

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.150
what the truth should be.

00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:47.850
So here is an open
problem, which is,

00:45:47.850 --> 00:45:53.270
what happens to Turán's theorem
for 3-uniform hypergraphs?

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:02.570
So don't be scared by
the word hypergraph.

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:06.160
So whereas you think of graphs
as having edges consisting

00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:08.260
of pairs of vertices,
a hypergraph

00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:12.200
is simply a structure where,
for a 3-uniform hypergraph,

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:14.625
the edges are triples,
triples of vertices.

00:46:17.130 --> 00:46:26.770
So the question is, what is
the maximum number of triples

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:37.820
in 3-uniform
hypergraph without--

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:40.040
well, for Mantel's
theorem, we asked what

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.885
happens without a triangle.

00:46:41.885 --> 00:46:45.560
For a 3-uniform, the
basic question you can ask

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.940
is, what about
forbidding a tetrahedral?

00:46:53.590 --> 00:47:02.280
So suppose you do
have four vertices

00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:08.370
such that every triple inside
the four vertices is a niche.

00:47:08.370 --> 00:47:10.770
What's the maximum
number of edges

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:17.600
you can have in an n-vertex,
3-uniform hypergraph.

00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.990
Already, it's not so easy to
come up with good examples.

00:47:21.990 --> 00:47:24.710
So Turán's theorem says
take a bipartite graph,

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:26.700
complete bipartite graph.

00:47:26.700 --> 00:47:30.090
Well, here, it's not so easy
to come up with examples,

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:31.890
but there are some examples.

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:35.630
And in fact, Turán suggested
the following construction.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:41.790
Namely, you divide the set
of vertices, as before,

00:47:41.790 --> 00:47:46.610
to three roughly
equal-sized parts.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:50.960
And let me take all triples that
look like one of the following

00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:57.150
forms, either three vertices,
one in each vertex set,

00:47:57.150 --> 00:48:00.720
or a triple, looking
like that-- two

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:03.580
vertex in one set,
one in the next set,

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.990
or going cyclically, like that.

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:11.870
So I include all triples,
one of these forms.

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:15.990
And you should check
that this construction

00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:19.580
has no tetrahedron.

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:21.340
If it had a
tetrahedron, you would

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.910
have had at least two
vertices in one part, also

00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:28.566
then where the other
two vertices can be.

00:48:28.566 --> 00:48:32.640
If you check that,
it cannot happen.

00:48:32.640 --> 00:48:35.780
So then, how many
edges does it have?

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:37.400
The exact number is
not so important.

00:48:37.400 --> 00:48:40.442
But what's important is
that the edge density--

00:48:40.442 --> 00:48:43.550
of all the possible
triples, the fraction

00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:47.840
of edges that are containing
this construction is 5/9.

00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:54.790
And it is conjectured
that this is optimal.

00:48:59.410 --> 00:49:02.500
However, we're quite far
from proving this number.

00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:09.920
So the best upper bound that
is currently available--

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:13.640
and it's found quite recently
using this fairly new method

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.730
in graph theory called
flag algebras, essentially

00:49:16.730 --> 00:49:20.840
a computerized way to try
to prove such inequalities.

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:28.690
And the best upper bound
is something like 0.562.

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:32.910
And there's a major open problem
to either prove or disprove

00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:36.780
that this construction
here is the optimal one.

00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:39.840
So you see, even though I
presented so many proofs

00:49:39.840 --> 00:49:42.210
of Mantel's theorem and
Turán's theorem, at this point,

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:43.660
hopefully they should all be--

00:49:43.660 --> 00:49:46.200
they seem quite
simple in retrospect.

00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.100
It's deceptive.

00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.320
And even if I changed and tweak
the problem just a little bit,

00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:57.000
going to 3-uniform
hypergraph instead of graphs,

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.670
we really have no
idea what's going on.

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:00.170
Yes?

00:50:00.170 --> 00:50:00.690
Question?

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:02.790
AUDIENCE: So
basically, how do you--

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:07.250
why you say that this is really
bad compared to a two-number?

00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:09.355
It doesn't seem like
that big a difference.

00:50:09.355 --> 00:50:09.980
YUFEI ZHAO: OK.

00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:10.620
So great.

00:50:10.620 --> 00:50:14.380
So the question is, why do
I say it's a pretty big gap.

00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:19.070
So we know that there
has to be some proportion

00:50:19.070 --> 00:50:21.570
of the total number of triples.

00:50:21.570 --> 00:50:23.810
So, well, you have two numbers.

00:50:23.810 --> 00:50:28.290
And well, I mean, to me,
they seem pretty far apart.

00:50:28.290 --> 00:50:30.200
It's not some lower-order gap.

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:31.600
So this is a first-order gap.

00:50:34.150 --> 00:50:35.145
Any more questions?

00:50:35.145 --> 00:50:36.770
But it's true that
later in the course,

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:38.930
we'll see gaps that
are much bigger.

00:50:38.930 --> 00:50:42.820
We'll see gaps where there's
a polynomial on one side

00:50:42.820 --> 00:50:46.350
and a power of exponentials
on the other side.

00:50:46.350 --> 00:50:48.290
And there, I agree,
that's much worse.

00:50:48.290 --> 00:50:49.300
The gap is much bigger.

00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:50.810
Here, it's just two numbers.

00:50:50.810 --> 00:50:55.285
But in the worst case, there
can be two numbers anywhere.

00:50:55.285 --> 00:50:58.745
Any more questions?

00:50:58.745 --> 00:51:00.120
So throughout this
course, I will

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:02.340
try to bring out
some open problems.

00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:03.850
And there are lots.

00:51:03.850 --> 00:51:05.970
So I will tell you
what we do understand.

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:08.160
But most things, we
do not understand.

00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:11.850
And hopefully, some of
you will go out and try

00:51:11.850 --> 00:51:14.640
to understand them better so the
next time I teach the course,

00:51:14.640 --> 00:51:16.223
I could have something
new to present.

00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:28.880
So now that we've addressed
the question of what's

00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.920
the maximum number of
edges if you forbid

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:35.090
a triangle or a clique, the
next natural thing to ask

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:39.510
is, what about if you
forbid a general H?

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:45.440
So give me a graph H. And what's
the maximum number of edges

00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.700
if you forbid that H?

00:51:56.430 --> 00:51:58.550
It will be helpful
to do some notation.

00:51:58.550 --> 00:52:02.750
So the extremal number,
which we'll denote by ex,

00:52:02.750 --> 00:52:06.920
and this is also called
the Turán number sometimes

00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:11.350
because of Turán's theorem.

00:52:11.350 --> 00:52:15.770
So I'll probably call it
the extremal number more

00:52:15.770 --> 00:52:18.240
frequently.

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:21.560
So this number here is defined
to be the maximum number

00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:40.430
of edges in an n-vertex
graph containing no copy of H

00:52:40.430 --> 00:52:41.050
as a subgraph.

00:52:51.900 --> 00:52:55.090
I want to just clarify
a piece of notation.

00:52:55.090 --> 00:53:02.130
So when I say a subgraph,
so what do I mean?

00:53:02.130 --> 00:53:06.060
So there are several notions of
different kinds of subgraphs.

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.720
And a couple that come
up somewhat frequently,

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.280
one is subgraph.

00:53:11.280 --> 00:53:13.920
And then there's something
called induced subgraph.

00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.700
So it's probably easiest if
I just show you an example.

00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:30.170
So suppose my H
is the four cycle.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:34.910
So in the example of
H being a subgraph,

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:38.900
suppose I have this graph here.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:49.770
So H is a subgraph of this graph
here in many different ways,

00:53:49.770 --> 00:53:53.316
but in particular, like that.

00:53:53.316 --> 00:53:56.070
But you see there are
some more edges that

00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.330
are among the vertices.

00:53:57.330 --> 00:53:57.960
But that's OK.

00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:02.070
So subgraph only requires you
to have a subset of vertices

00:54:02.070 --> 00:54:07.560
and a subset of edges,
whereas induced subgraphs--

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.745
this is not an example
of induced subgraph.

00:54:09.745 --> 00:54:17.670
And so induced
subgraph means that you

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:22.190
take this set of
vertices and you

00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:26.090
look at all the edges
in the big graph

00:54:26.090 --> 00:54:29.060
among your set of vertices.

00:54:29.060 --> 00:54:30.430
So that's an induced subgraph.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:35.720
So here, the four cycle is
an induced subgraph, but not

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:38.730
induced subgraph over here.

00:54:38.730 --> 00:54:40.700
So I just want to make
that distinction clear.

00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.550
And for now, in
this chapter, we'll

00:54:43.550 --> 00:54:48.205
only talk about subgraphs--
so not induced, necessarily.

00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.000
All right.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.710
So let's recap what happened
for Turán's theorem.

00:55:01.090 --> 00:55:09.900
So Turán's theorem told us that
the extremal number of these

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:17.620
cliques, well, we know very
precisely to be the number

00:55:17.620 --> 00:55:21.110
of edges in the Turán graph.

00:55:21.110 --> 00:55:24.440
And in particular, we saw
from the last proof, but also,

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:26.630
similarly, if you
just do a calculation,

00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:32.650
that it is at most this
quantity over here.

00:55:32.650 --> 00:55:36.860
And it's basically
that quantity.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:45.410
So the number of edges in this
Turán graph is asymptotically

00:55:45.410 --> 00:55:50.000
that quantity up to
a lower-order error;

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.330
if you like n go to
infinity, r fixed.

00:55:56.050 --> 00:55:58.570
And the basic question
is, what about general H?

00:55:58.570 --> 00:56:05.580
And so if I give you some
arbitrary graph H, what can you

00:56:05.580 --> 00:56:08.430
tell me about the
maximum number of edges

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:14.930
in the graph forbidding
this H as a subgraph?

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:18.240
And it turns out, for most
H's, we have a pretty good

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.370
understanding, and perhaps
quite surprisingly,

00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:21.870
because you can
imagine this problem

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.030
looks like it might
get quite complicated.

00:56:24.030 --> 00:56:27.990
All the proofs that we've done
are very specific to cliques.

00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:31.590
But it turns out that we
already understand a lot.

00:56:31.590 --> 00:56:34.290
And the critical
parameter that governs

00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:39.640
how this quantity behaves is
the chromatic number of H.

00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.850
So if you call me the
chromatic number of H,

00:56:41.850 --> 00:56:44.520
I can already tell
you quite a lot.

00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:47.910
So just to remind you, the
chromatic number of a graph

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:51.150
is the minimum number
of colors you need

00:56:51.150 --> 00:56:54.390
to properly color this graph.

00:56:54.390 --> 00:57:04.060
Chromatic number of
H, denoted chi of H,

00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:13.970
is the minimum number
of colors needed

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:29.060
to color the vertices of H so
that no two adjacent vertices

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:29.930
have the same color.

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:44.730
So for instance, if I give you
a clique of r plus 1 vertices,

00:57:44.730 --> 00:57:46.920
so all the vertices must
receive different colors,

00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:49.090
because every pair of
vertices is adjacent--

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:52.520
so the chromatic
number is r plus 1.

00:57:52.520 --> 00:58:00.991
The chromatic number of
the Turán graph is what?

00:58:05.290 --> 00:58:05.790
It's r.

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:09.030
So the chromatic number
of the Turán graph is r.

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:12.130
I can color each part in
this complete bipartite

00:58:12.130 --> 00:58:15.120
graph using a different color.

00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:17.230
And that's the best I can do.

00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:28.220
Now, if I have one graph being a
subgraph of another graph, what

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.960
can you tell me about
the relationships

00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:31.460
between their chromatic numbers?

00:58:38.945 --> 00:58:47.227
So if H is a subgraph
of G, so what can

00:58:47.227 --> 00:58:48.810
you tell me about
relationship between

00:58:48.810 --> 00:58:49.830
their chromatic numbers?

00:58:52.752 --> 00:58:54.700
AUDIENCE: Chi of H is
less than the other chi.

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:55.450
YUFEI ZHAO: So OK.

00:58:55.450 --> 00:59:00.790
You're telling me that the
chi of H is at most chi of G.

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:03.050
And why is that?

00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:04.688
AUDIENCE: Because
if G can be colored

00:59:04.688 --> 00:59:10.503
with a certain number of colors,
then that also has [INAUDIBLE]..

00:59:10.503 --> 00:59:11.470
YUFEI ZHAO: Great.

00:59:11.470 --> 00:59:15.140
Whatever coloring you do for
G, you use the same coloring,

00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:17.760
and that's a proper
coloring for H as well.

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.240
So the chromatic number
of H might be smaller,

00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:23.380
but certainly cannot be
bigger than that of G.

00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:34.580
So in particular, if you have a
graph H with chromatic number r

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:44.400
plus 1, then this Turán
on graph is always H-free.

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:50.310
So if H requires four
colors, it cannot be embedded

00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:54.260
into the complete multipartite
graph of three parts.

00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:59.380
So the Turán graph is also an
example of an H-free graph with

00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:01.160
lots of edges.

01:00:01.160 --> 01:00:07.380
And this tells us that the
extremal number of H is

01:00:07.380 --> 01:00:11.600
at least that of
this Turán number,

01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:18.316
where r is defined as the
chromatic number minus 1.

01:00:18.316 --> 01:00:23.128
So that's some
lower-bound construction.

01:00:23.128 --> 01:00:25.000
So as we saw
earlier, and we know

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:29.170
what the asymptotic is like
for the number of edges,

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:31.769
this n goes to infinity.

01:00:31.769 --> 01:00:34.970
Namely, it's like that.

01:00:38.071 --> 01:00:41.340
And now the question is,
is this the right answer?

01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:43.410
Is it possible
that we completely

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:48.680
missed some construction that
might produce a lot more edges?

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:49.710
And it turns out--

01:00:49.710 --> 01:00:52.080
and I think this should
be somewhat surprising.

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:55.230
Because so far, I feel like
I haven't told you anything

01:00:55.230 --> 01:00:58.950
all that surprising yet.

01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:01.590
This seems like a fairly
mysterious problem.

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:06.210
But it turns out that this is
more or less the right answer.

01:01:06.210 --> 01:01:11.040
So you cannot do much
better than the Turán graph.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:20.090
And there's the theorem of
Erdos, Stone, and Simonovits

01:01:20.090 --> 01:01:36.240
rich that for every graph H--

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:42.890
so if I fixed H,
then the limit as n

01:01:42.890 --> 01:01:49.340
goes to infinity of
the extremal number

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.380
is a fraction of
total number of pairs.

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:55.270
So here, this is
the edge density.

01:01:55.270 --> 01:02:04.590
So this quantity here is
equal to 1 minus chi of H.

01:02:04.590 --> 01:02:08.230
So 1 minus 1 over
chi of H minus 1.

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:11.410
So the chromatic
number, in some sense,

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:18.530
completely determines how big
the extremal number should be.

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:22.010
And you see that so far
everything we've proved,

01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:25.140
Turán's theorem, Mantel's
theorem agree with this formula

01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:25.640
here.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:30.160
But if I give you some H,
maybe quite complicated,

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.560
and those previous
proofs don't work,

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:37.410
well, still you know the
first order asymptotics.

01:02:37.410 --> 01:02:38.660
But there's still more to say.

01:02:38.660 --> 01:02:41.030
But first, let me just
run through some examples

01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:42.370
for a sanity check.

01:02:42.370 --> 01:02:46.774
So if H is a triangle--

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:59.340
so if H, the chromatic
number, and this limit--

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:03.550
so if H is the triangle,
chromatic number is 3.

01:03:03.550 --> 01:03:06.230
So then this limit is 1/2.

01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:07.750
And that's indeed the case.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:10.240
So that's what we did
with Mantel's theorem.

01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.850
If H is a clique
of four vertices,

01:03:12.850 --> 01:03:16.510
then the chromatic number is 4.

01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:20.670
And the answer is 2/3.

01:03:20.670 --> 01:03:24.120
And also, that agrees
with Turán's theorem.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.630
It agrees with Turán's theorem.

01:03:25.630 --> 01:03:30.100
But I can give you some
fairly complicated-looking H.

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.920
So for example, H might
be the Petersen graph.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.200
So every good
graph theory course

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:45.710
should feature a Petersen
graph at least once, somewhere.

01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:48.660
So that's the Petersen graph.

01:03:48.660 --> 01:03:50.946
What's the chromatic number
of the Petersen graph?

01:03:50.946 --> 01:03:52.738
Actually, that's kind
of a tricky question.

01:03:52.738 --> 01:03:54.196
The last time I
taught this course,

01:03:54.196 --> 01:03:55.710
I even got the answer wrong.

01:03:55.710 --> 01:04:00.050
So it turns out you can
three-color the Petersen graph.

01:04:00.050 --> 01:04:03.390
So it's completely not
obvious how to do this.

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.660
But there are only
so many vertices.

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.240
If you stare at it long enough,
you can see what happens.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.220
But let me just show you a
three-coloring of the Petersen

01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:12.720
graph.

01:04:21.135 --> 01:04:26.640
Then the third
color is like that.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:30.880
So that's a three-coloring
of the Petersen graph.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:32.340
That's chromatic number 3.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:33.320
It's not 2.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:35.146
So why is it not 2?

01:04:35.146 --> 01:04:36.460
AUDIENCE: It's not bipartite.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:37.752
YUFEI ZHAO: It's not bipartite.

01:04:37.752 --> 01:04:40.770
It's a five cycle, which
cannot be two-colored.

01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:44.230
So then the limit is 1/2.

01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:47.410
And-- no.

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:50.070
That's 3.

01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:51.030
Great.

01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:52.740
So the limit is 1/2.

01:04:52.740 --> 01:04:55.650
And here, I think that
we can apply this theorem

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:58.350
of Erdos-Stone-Simonovits.

01:04:58.350 --> 01:05:01.420
And I think this should
be somewhat surprising.

01:05:01.420 --> 01:05:04.120
Because the Petersen graph
looks quite complicated.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.560
If you try to forbid
this graph in some big G,

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:10.380
it seems like it's
kind of hard to do.

01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:12.380
But it turns out the
chromatic number completely

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:18.120
governs the behavior of
the extremal numbers.

01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:23.510
But it turns out that's
not the entire story.

01:05:23.510 --> 01:05:26.280
Because while this is quite
a good theorem, and I said,

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.700
it gives you the
first-order asymptotics,

01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:30.000
actually, that's a lie.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:34.010
It doesn't always give you
the first-order asymptotics.

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:37.830
And when is
Erdos-Stone-Simonovits

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.300
not effective?

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:41.130
Or rather, it's
not the complete--

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:43.490
it's not the final answer.

01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:48.280
Well, you can say, well,
what about this little o?

01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:52.610
So we're still trying to
understand, there's a limit.

01:05:52.610 --> 01:05:56.860
And you can understand
what is the--

01:05:56.860 --> 01:06:00.810
how quickly does it converge
to this number here?

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:03.830
So that's certainly
a valid question.

01:06:03.830 --> 01:06:09.654
But more importantly, though,
if your graphic is bipartite,

01:06:09.654 --> 01:06:19.103
if chi of H equals
to 2, i.e. bipartite,

01:06:19.103 --> 01:06:22.190
then all this
theorem tells you is

01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:26.570
that the limit is equal
to 0, which somehow is not

01:06:26.570 --> 01:06:28.010
the most satisfying answer.

01:06:28.010 --> 01:06:30.590
You want to know the
first-order asymptotics.

01:06:30.590 --> 01:06:32.240
I mean, this still
tells you something.

01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:34.790
So the Erdos-Stone-Simonovits
theorem

01:06:34.790 --> 01:06:38.230
tells you that the
extremal number

01:06:38.230 --> 01:06:42.268
is little o of n squared.

01:06:42.268 --> 01:06:43.180
But of course, no.

01:06:43.180 --> 01:06:44.760
You are a curious mathematician.

01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:48.950
And you want to know, really,
what is the asymptotics?

01:06:48.950 --> 01:06:51.620
Is it like n to the 3/2?

01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.840
Is it like n to the 4/3?

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:56.670
You know, is this
is not satisfying.

01:06:56.670 --> 01:07:01.810
And it turns out, from
most bipartite graphs H,

01:07:01.810 --> 01:07:04.040
it is a very difficult
problem that we still

01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:06.050
do not know the answer
to, even what is

01:07:06.050 --> 01:07:08.510
the order of the asymptotics.

01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:11.240
So the next few lectures,
what I want to do

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.400
is to show you some
techniques that

01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:18.550
will allow you to
prove some upper bounds

01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:21.550
for this extremal
number in the case

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:25.090
when H is bipartite that shows
you that the exponent can

01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:27.500
be less than 2.

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:31.490
And I will also show
you some constructions

01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:34.940
that sometimes, but
in the very few cases,

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:37.020
matches the upper bound.

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:41.630
So there are very few examples
of graphs H for which we know

01:07:41.630 --> 01:07:43.860
the first-order asymptotics.

01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:47.450
And for most graph H, they
are major open problems

01:07:47.450 --> 01:07:48.465
in combinatorics.

01:07:48.465 --> 01:07:50.840
And there are some really old
ones for which any solution

01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:52.280
may be quite exciting.

01:07:56.580 --> 01:07:59.730
I will not show you a proof
of Erdos-Stone-Simonovits now.

01:07:59.730 --> 01:08:01.290
We will see that
later in the term,

01:08:01.290 --> 01:08:03.870
once we have developed
some more machinery.

01:08:03.870 --> 01:08:07.320
Although, later on in the
term, we'll see a proof using

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.450
the so-called Szemerédi's
regularity lemma,

01:08:09.450 --> 01:08:12.720
which I've mentioned a few
times in the first lecture.

01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:16.270
Although, you don't actually
need such heavy machinery.

01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:19.500
So the original proofs
of Erdos and Stone,

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.570
and also by Simonovits--

01:08:21.570 --> 01:08:25.290
so Erdos and Stone first
proved this result for H

01:08:25.290 --> 01:08:27.750
being a complete
multipartite graph.

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:30.750
And Simonovits
observed that knowing

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.760
H for a complete
multipartite graph

01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:35.109
actually implies this
result in general.

01:08:35.109 --> 01:08:38.430
So you will not find
a paper with all three

01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:41.170
of them being authors.

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:45.328
But this is what the
theorem is called.

01:08:45.328 --> 01:08:47.870
So later on in the course, once
we've developed the machinery

01:08:47.870 --> 01:08:51.859
of graph regularity lemmas,
I will show you how you can

01:08:51.859 --> 01:08:56.992
deduce Erdos-Stone-Simonovits
from Turán's theorem.

01:08:56.992 --> 01:09:00.140
So somehow you use Turán's
theorem and bootstrap it

01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:04.380
to Erdos-Stone-Simonovits.

01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:06.810
So that should seem
somewhat magical.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:08.580
So on one hand,
you have cliques.

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:11.399
On the other hand, you
have things that somehow

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:12.750
don't have cliques in them.

01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:14.250
They don't really
look like cliques.

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:16.460
But you can still
bootstrap one to the other.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.170
And so after we develop some
machinery, we'll do that.

01:09:19.170 --> 01:09:21.180
But there is a
combinatorial proof

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:24.689
which doesn't use any
of this heavy machinery.

01:09:24.689 --> 01:09:27.750
I won't discuss it in lecture,
but you can look it up.

01:09:27.750 --> 01:09:29.200
And it's quite nice.

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.930
It has some
combinatorial techniques

01:09:30.930 --> 01:09:33.004
and some double-counting
arguments.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:42.880
So going forward, I want to
show you some questions, mostly

01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:44.609
questions, but some
answers as well--

01:09:44.609 --> 01:09:49.640
so questions such as, what
is the extremal number of--

01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:53.920
well, so what are some of
the basic bipartite graphs?

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.620
One of them is just a
complete bipartite graph.

01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.000
So this has a name.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.170
It's called the
Zarankiewicz problem.

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:06.650
And for some values of s
and t, we know the answer.

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:09.700
But for most values, we have
no idea what the answer is.

01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:16.510
For example for K4,4, we do
not know what is the correct

01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:19.472
exponent on the n.

01:10:19.472 --> 01:10:23.020
So even fairly small cases,
it is very much open.

01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.240
So this is all to show you
that these simple proofs

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:29.425
that we did today, they are
perhaps too deceptively simple.

01:10:29.425 --> 01:10:32.587
Because even if you change
the question a little bit,

01:10:32.587 --> 01:10:33.670
we don't understand a lot.

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.520
So questions like
these will occupy

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.630
the next several lectures.

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:41.390
And I'll also show you
some constructions.

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:42.932
And there are some
constructions that

01:10:42.932 --> 01:10:45.540
use nice algebraic ideas and
some probabilistic ideas.

01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:49.730
So we'll see ideas coming
from many different sources.

01:10:49.730 --> 01:10:53.360
I want to close off by
just a cultural remark.

01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.110
So in this course,
especially the first half,

01:10:57.110 --> 01:11:00.530
we'll encounter a lot
of Hungarian names.

01:11:00.530 --> 01:11:02.600
So we already saw
a couple of them.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.000
And I just want to give
you a very quick tutorial

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.490
on how to pronounce
Hungarian names, just

01:11:08.490 --> 01:11:10.370
for cultural purposes now.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:12.380
In the past, when
I took this CLASS

01:11:12.380 --> 01:11:14.000
there were no
Hungarian speakers.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.560
But I think we do have at
least one Hungarian speaker

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.060
in the room.

01:11:17.060 --> 01:11:18.940
So I want you--

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:21.020
but you are a native
Hungarian speaker.

01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.580
So you should tell us.

01:11:22.580 --> 01:11:26.288
So can you help us
pronounce these names?

01:11:26.288 --> 01:11:27.530
AUDIENCE: Erdos.

01:11:27.530 --> 01:11:29.150
YUFEI ZHAO: Erdos.

01:11:29.150 --> 01:11:30.900
And this one?

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.720
AUDIENCE: That doesn't
seem like a Hungarian name.

01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:35.130
[LAUGHTER]

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:40.790
YUFEI ZHAO: So this,
Hungarian, it's Simonovits.

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:45.860
So I'll just tell you two
things about Hungarian names.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.637
One of them is that the S--

01:11:47.637 --> 01:11:48.470
AUDIENCE: It's /sh/.

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:52.160
YUFEI ZHAO: --is
pronounced like /sh/.

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:55.070
And another thing
that comes up is S-Z,

01:11:55.070 --> 01:11:56.870
which we saw in Szemerédi.

01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:58.560
So this is pronounced like /s/.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.275
Forget the Z.

01:12:01.275 --> 01:12:08.050
So Erdos, another thing about
Erdos that you should know

01:12:08.050 --> 01:12:09.190
is that--

01:12:09.190 --> 01:12:11.530
what is this accent?

01:12:11.530 --> 01:12:13.502
It is not a double dot.

01:12:13.502 --> 01:12:18.730
So in LaTeX you would
type it as slash H,

01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:24.460
and in particular,
not like that.

01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:31.320
So just a few cultural
remarks about names.

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:31.820
Great.

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:32.690
So we'll end today.

01:12:32.690 --> 01:12:34.910
And then next time,
we'll start looking

01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:40.260
at other extremal numbers
for more bipartite graphs.

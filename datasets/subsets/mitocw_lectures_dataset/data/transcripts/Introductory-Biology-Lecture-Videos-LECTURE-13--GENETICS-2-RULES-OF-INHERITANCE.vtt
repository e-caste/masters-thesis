00:00:16.673 --> 00:00:18.090
ADAM MARTIN: So
today, we're going

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.670
to continue with genetics.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.830
And we're going to
talk about the rules

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.870
or laws of inheritance.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.600
I expect that many,
if not all of you

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.540
have been exposed to
these rules before.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.970
And so what I really
want to do today

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.210
is make the connection
between these laws

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.670
and the behavior of
chromosomes, such

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.400
that when you're thinking
about genetics and inheritance

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.210
pattern you're thinking about
chromosomes undergoing meiosis.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.450
And I wanted to start just
to make the point that there

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:01.110
are a number of human traits
and human diseases that show

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.319
clear inheritance patterns.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:08.460
And what's shown up here is
what's known as a pedigree.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.020
So this is a pedigree.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.000
Let's block this off.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.280
I'm showing you a pedigree,
which shows relationships

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.380
and a family tree.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.720
And so what you can see--

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:27.450
what these symbols denote
are, you have an open box.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.700
That is an unaffected male.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.050
So open box is an
unaffected male.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.440
And what I mean by
unaffected is usually

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.630
it means they don't have
the disease that we're

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.850
talking about.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.100
Circles represent females.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.445
And so an open circle would
be an unaffected female.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.610
And finally, if you have
one of these symbols,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.890
either male or female,
and it's shaded in,

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.220
that, by convention, represents
an affected individual.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.050
So that's an individual that
has the disease or trait.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.860
So this is an
affected individual.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.820
So this is an
example of a disease

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.210
that you've already heard
about from Professor Imperiali.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.190
This is a family tree
that's indicative of a type

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.440
of inheritance that's seen in
families with a disease called

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.200
phenylketonuria.

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.200
And you'll remember from
Professor Imperiali's lecture,

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.570
this is a disease where there's
a mutation or allele in which

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.150
there is a defective enzyme that
can't process the amino acid

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.960
phenylalanine.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.960
And so patients
with this disorder

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.330
have to be very careful
about their diet

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.330
such that they don't intake
too much phenylalanine.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.400
And what you see about
this trait or disease

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.310
is that it's skipping
multiple generations.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.670
And then it manifests
itself down here.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.320
I'm not getting any arrow.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.130
So I'm just going to
use this pointer here.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.730
So here you see there
are several individuals.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.240
There's a male and a
female with the disease.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.050
And it results
from a relationship

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.120
between two first cousins.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.050
So only in this case does
the disease sort of appear.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:49.000
And you can think of this
as a recessive trait.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.430
In this case, it's
autosomal recessive.

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.340
So for PKU, this is
exhibiting what's

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.350
a type of inheritance known
as autosomal recessive.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.050
And the reason
that it's recessive

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.870
is because if an
individual just has

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.840
one copy of a
functional enzyme, then

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.180
they don't have the disease.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.899
So you can see that it's
only individuals that

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:22.390
have both defective
versions, which

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:26.800
are labeled lowercase a here,
that exhibit the disease.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.170
So in the case of PKU,
lowercase a represents

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:33.160
the defective enzyme.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.290
And uppercase A denotes
a functional enzyme.

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.790
Now, it's not shown
here, but it's possible

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:58.120
that an ancestor sort of
above this parental generation

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.760
also exhibited this
disease, such that there'd

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.930
be a sign that this is being
inherited across generations.

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.990
So that's not as obvious
in this disorder,

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.020
because it's a very
rare genetic disorder.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.110
But more common disorders,
such as color blindness,

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.770
show a more clear inheritance
from generation to generation.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:24.320
So is anyone here colorblind?

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.100
I ask just to know how to
set up my slides as well.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.400
No one's colorblind.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.050
OK, that's good.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.550
Then you'll all see the
difference between the image

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.680
on the left and the
image on the right.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.390
So if you have
normal vision, that's

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.240
what you see on the left
from this fruit stand.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:46.340
But for those that are
missing the red photopigment

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.770
in your cone cells, you
exhibit color blindness.

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:57.030
And this fruit stand would look
like the image on the right.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:02.530
So this is a clear example of
an inherited trait in humans.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.800
And this is an example
of an inheritance pattern

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.300
that would be similar
to human colorblindness.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.700
And here you can
see a clear example

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.890
where you have an affected
individual, an affected

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.290
male here.

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:19.350
That male has five
daughters, none of which

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:23.430
exhibit the
phenotype or disease.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.920
But several of those daughters
give rise to progeny, sons,

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.390
that have the disease.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.440
So in this case, you see this
trait skips a generation.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.460
But essentially, the grandfather
here has passed on the trait

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.330
to his grandsons.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:50.160
And so colorblindness is a
little bit different from PKU,

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.780
not only in the fact
that it's more frequent--

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.920
so it's about 10% of males
exhibit colorblindness

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:57.640
in the population.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.560
But also you see with
PKU you had both a female

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.330
and a male affected.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.210
And in this case, you're
seeing a preponderance

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:10.030
of affected males, which
seems to be not random.

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:16.650
And so this colorblindness
exhibits a different type

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:21.280
of inheritance pattern, which is
known as sex-linked recessive.

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:30.300
And I'm going to come back
to this inheritance pattern

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.070
at the end of the lecture.

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:35.460
Because it's actually this
type of inheritance pattern

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.700
which helped researchers
about 100 years ago

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.910
make the connection between
the unit of heredity

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:45.150
the gene and chromosomes.

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:47.700
So we'll talk about
another example

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:52.260
of this type of inheritance
pattern at the end.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.050
So for today, what we're
going to talk about is

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.500
we're going to start with
some of the basic laws

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.110
of autosomal inheritance.

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.420
And so we're going
to talk about Gregor

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.410
Mendel and his seminal
studies in the pea plant.

00:08:07.410 --> 00:08:09.390
And then towards the
end of the lecture,

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.610
we're going to talk
about sex linkage.

00:08:11.610 --> 00:08:14.790
And I'm going to tell you
about work done in fruit flies,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:18.690
and specifically, their
eye color trait, which

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.620
led to the linkage between
the behavior of genes

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.230
and the behavior of chromosomes.

00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:27.390
So that's what we have
in store for today.

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.289
So first, I'm going to tell
you a little bit about what

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.780
enabled Mendel's theory.

00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:40.260
I guess I could start over here.

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.159
So what enabled Mendel's theory?

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:51.545
And I presume that most of you
have heard about Mendel before.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:09:00.150
So there might be a little
bit of a reminder for you,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.580
but I also hope
that we kind of make

00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.870
a very clear connection
between Mendel's theory

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.330
and the behavior of chromosomes.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:15.090
So Mendel did his seminal
studies using the pea plant.

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.870
And one aspect of
pea plant biology

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.900
that was really essential
for Mendel's theory

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:31.080
is that you can both
self-pollinate pea plants,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:35.400
meaning you can take the
male gametes from a pea plant

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.150
and mate it to the female
gametes from the same pea

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:38.670
plant.

00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:42.450
So it's entirely
within the same plant.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:47.250
So you can self-pollinate,
meaning you do a cross--

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:51.150
you basically cross a plant
to itself, which, obviously,

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:52.710
we can't do with humans.

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:55.050
You can't do with
many organisms.

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:59.250
Or you can
cross-pollinate, meaning

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:03.150
you take the male
gamete from one plant,

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.520
and you combine it
with the female gamete

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.525
from a different plant.

00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:15.810
And as we go through
Mendel's experiments,

00:10:15.810 --> 00:10:18.690
you'll see how this
was used to define

00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.220
the rules of inheritance.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.610
Another property of the
pea plants and something

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:31.800
that Mendel took
advantage of was he

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:39.420
chose traits of pea plants that
exhibited a very clear dominant

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.770
or recessive phenotype.

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:54.180
So he used visible
traits, visible traits

00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:57.430
with a very clear
dominance or recessiveness.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.540
And if we go back to
our example of PKU,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.330
you can see how this human
disorder, the genes that

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.160
determine this disorder--

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.420
the alleles have a very clear
dominance or recessiveness.

00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:30.940
The dominant allele is often
denoted with a capital letter.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.200
In this case for PKU, you
we used capital letter A.

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.750
Or in this case, the disease
allele was lower case a.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:41.980
And that's recessive.

00:11:41.980 --> 00:11:47.530
And if an allele has dominance,
what that essentially means

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.220
is that being homozygous
for the dominant allele

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:56.980
is equivalent to having just
one copy of that allele.

00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:00.190
And so I think if you
think of the PKU example,

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.810
this is very clear.

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:05.050
Because the disease
phenotype results

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:07.420
from a defective enzyme.

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:11.680
So if you just have one copy of
the enzyme that's functional,

00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.230
then the human can have wild
type or normal function.

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:20.680
So in order to really lack
function of this enzyme,

00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:23.790
you need to be homozygous for
the non-functional allele.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:29.980
So you need to not have any
normal copy of that enzyme.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.920
Because if you just have one
copy of that enzyme, you're OK.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.690
Because you have
an enzyme that's

00:12:34.690 --> 00:12:37.390
functional and will
carry out that function

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.620
in the cells of your body.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:49.500
The last point I want to make is
that Mendel did his experiments

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.580
starting with what are known
as pure breeding lines.

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.605
So he started with
pure breeding lines.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.030
And what I mean by
pure breeding are

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:05.640
these are lines that if
you take these plants

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.760
and just self-cross them over
and over again, generation

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.490
to generation, they
will only give rise

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:16.230
to plants with
traits that reflect

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:18.390
the parental generation.

00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:20.220
So there's basically
no variation.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.370
And you'll see in just a
moment that another way

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:33.270
to denote pure breeding means
that for a certain trait

00:13:33.270 --> 00:13:37.710
you have an allele combination
which is homozygous.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.400
So another way to think
of pure breeding lines

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:47.690
are these are plants that have
a homozygous allele composition.

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:50.610
Homozygous meaning
that either they

00:13:50.610 --> 00:13:54.490
have two copies of one allele or
two copies of the other allele.

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.710
I just want to make
the point that Mendel

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:11.400
had to overcome a
number of hurdles

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.090
in order to get these results.

00:14:13.090 --> 00:14:16.020
And Mendel is not
exactly your sort

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:21.810
of clear example
of a success story.

00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.380
So Mendel applied to get
a teaching certificate

00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:27.000
in university.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.370
And he failed out.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:34.350
And I'll quote one of his
instructors who said, I quote,

00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:36.930
"He lacks insight and
the requisite clarity

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:39.600
of knowledge."

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.570
So that guy feels stupid.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:46.980
So next-- so Mendel
did his experiments.

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:53.190
And the significance
of his work was never

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:55.080
recognized throughout
his lifetime.

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:58.950
He did his experiments
in the 1850s and '60s.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.960
He died in 1884.

00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:04.200
He died not knowing at all what
the significance of his work

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.130
was.

00:15:05.130 --> 00:15:09.420
Because his work was then
found again in the early 1900s

00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:12.840
by the likes of Thomas
Hunt Morgan and others.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.600
And they made the connection
between Mendel's laws

00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.180
of inheritance and chromosomes.

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:19.830
And it was really
then that Mendel

00:15:19.830 --> 00:15:22.230
became the father of genetics.

00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.200
Because then there
was a physical model

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.180
for how inheritance was working.

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:32.160
But he died before
that happened.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.300
So he didn't realize that he
was the success that we now

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.920
know him to be.

00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:39.730
Another interesting story.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:42.390
He started his work with mice.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:46.140
He wanted to breed mice
with different coat colors.

00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.570
But he got in trouble
with his bishop,

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:52.320
because his bishop didn't
approve of him promoting sex

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.960
among these mice.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.960
Luckily, his bishop didn't
take a plant biology course.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.925
Because of course,
plants also have sex.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:08.490
But he had to under come
a number of hurdles.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.160
But he took advantage
of his garden.

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:14.550
And I was talking to someone
in my lab the other day.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:17.400
And she said, you know
what's great about Mendel?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.780
He had a garden.

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.630
And he just didn't
put it on Instagram.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:25.660
So he used his garden
to his advantage.

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:29.820
And so with his
modest garden, he

00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:35.430
came up with what are now known
as the rules of inheritance.

00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:37.500
And I'll start with
Mendel's first law.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.580
So Mendel's first law
is that every adult

00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:51.840
has a pair of genes
for a given trait.

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:55.590
And these are now what
we refer to as alleles.

00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:58.110
And we now refer to
them as genes as well.

00:16:58.110 --> 00:17:00.150
Mendel did not
use the term gene.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:05.400
He just had these abstract
sort of units of heredity.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.980
So his first law states
that, every adult

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:12.690
has two sort of units of
heredity that can be different.

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:16.770
And that they split during
the formation of the gametes.

00:17:16.770 --> 00:17:20.160
And the probability
that a gamete

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.520
will have a given
allele or a given unit

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.819
is equal probability.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:30.870
So what I hope you can see
is that this law, which

00:17:30.870 --> 00:17:34.200
is stated up there,
is a direct result

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.530
of the segregation of homologous
chromosomes during meiosis 1.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:55.720
Mendel did not know that.

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.850
But now looking back, we can
see how this manifests itself.

00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:08.130
And so during
meiosis 1, you recall

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:10.770
that the homologous
chromosomes here

00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.020
line up at the metaphase plate.

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.080
And they line up
opposite each other,

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.970
such that some of the gametes
will get the capital Y

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.620
allele shown here.

00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:24.450
And the other half
of the gametes

00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:27.000
will get this lower
case y allele.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.630
So there's a 50%
probability of a gamete

00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.110
either having one or the other.

00:18:34.110 --> 00:18:35.610
And of course, in
meiosis 1, this

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:39.690
is referred to as a
reduction or division.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.060
Because the
homologues are split.

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:45.180
And so the genetic
content of the gametes

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.310
are divided in half.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:57.250
So Mendel's first law,
the evidence for it

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:03.240
were the results of what is
known as a monohybrid cross.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.580
So Mendel did what is known
as a monohybrid cross where

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:16.170
he took pea plants that
were pure breeding for two

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.640
different traits.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.950
One was their pea color.

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.590
So it's yellow peas
versus green peas.

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:28.740
And he made a hybrid where
he takes a yellow plant that

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.590
arises from yellow
peas and crosses it

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:36.480
to a plant from a green pea.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:41.310
And this is known as
the parental generation.

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:54.990
And so the result of this
cross is that all of the peas

00:19:54.990 --> 00:19:57.090
were yellow.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:57.975
So 100%.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:05.100
This cross results
in 100% yellow peas.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:09.300
This is known as the first
filial generation, or the F1.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.630
And that should indicate to
you which of these traits

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:17.040
is dominant.

00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:20.760
Because if you take yellow peas
and you cross it to green peas,

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.070
and you get yellow
peas, that means

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:28.410
that the trait for
yellow peas is dominant.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:33.540
So for the rest of this, I
will denote the gene allele

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.590
that confers yellow peas
as capital Y and the gene

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:42.270
allele that encodes for
green peas as lower case y.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:46.570
And you see what I'm doing here
is I'm putting the phenotype--

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:50.160
I'm describing the
phenotype there,

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.450
which is just what the trait is
that manifests in the organism.

00:20:54.450 --> 00:20:57.150
But the genotype, which
is the combination

00:20:57.150 --> 00:21:02.250
of alleles in the organism, I'm
showing beneath the phenotype.

00:21:05.790 --> 00:21:09.030
And if these gene
alleles are splitting

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:12.750
during gamete formation
and then recombining

00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:18.390
during the formation of a new
plant, then, in this case,

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:24.280
this hybrid plant
is going to have

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:29.500
one allele that's capital Y and
one allele that's lowercase y.

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.840
And because these two
alleles are different,

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.960
this situation is
known as heterozygous.

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.860
So this is a heterozygous plant.

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:44.500
You can think of pure breeding
being analogous to homozygous.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.810
Because if you cross
yellow pea plant to itself,

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.780
you will only get
back yellow peas.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:51.460
So it breeds true.

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:53.770
You can think of
a hybrid as being

00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:56.970
equivalent to heterozygous,
because there are two gene

00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.620
alleles.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.590
So then what Mendel did
is he didn't stop there.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:07.820
He's self-crossed
or self-pollinated

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:11.575
these F1 plants and looked
at the resulting seeds.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:18.550
And so in the F2
generation, what he found

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:23.920
is that he got back both
the parental phenotypes--

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:31.720
so 75% of the progeny were
yellow, had yellow peas.

00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:37.900
And 25% had green peas.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.990
So there is this
3-to-1 ratio here.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:53.120
Now, if we think about this in
terms of Mendel's first law,

00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:55.010
where there's a
segregation of these

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:58.580
alleles during the
formation of gametes,

00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:01.250
and there's an equal
probability of having

00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:03.440
either one of these alleles--

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:07.910
if we think about
this cross here,

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:11.330
these plants, both the
male and female side,

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:15.590
are producing gametes that
are either big Y or little y.

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:26.510
So this would be
the female here.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:30.890
And so because
they're separating,

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:34.970
and there's a 1/2
probability of having

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:39.330
either the capital Y or
little y allele for the male--

00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:41.300
and there's also
a 1/2 probability

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:47.660
of having either of these
alleles for the female.

00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.930
So if you look at the possible
combination of gametes

00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.380
that could give rise
to the F2 generation,

00:23:54.380 --> 00:24:00.590
you have some that will
be pure breeding yellow.

00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:02.600
And the probability
here would be

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.880
the joint probability
of having this gamete

00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.080
and this gamete,
which is one quarter.

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.430
You then have two
classes here that

00:24:11.430 --> 00:24:16.910
have one copy of
the dominant allele

00:24:16.910 --> 00:24:18.860
and one copy of the
recessive allele.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:26.560
So these will have
the same genotype.

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:29.140
And these three will
have the same phenotype.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.510
They'll all be yellow peas.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:34.600
And so if you add up the
probabilities of all three

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:40.150
of these, you can see
that 3/4 will be yellow.

00:24:40.150 --> 00:24:46.360
So 3/4 of the progeny will
have the yellow phenotype.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:50.050
And you can see that another
quarter of the progeny

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:55.090
have the chance of getting two
copies of the recessive allele,

00:24:55.090 --> 00:24:56.290
and therefore will be green.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:03.280
So just by considering this as
a probability problem, which

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.650
is what Mendel did,
you can explain

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:11.560
the ratios of the progeny that
Mendel observed in his crosses.

00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:18.280
And I want to point
out the parallels

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:22.900
between this simple
cross with peas

00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:26.860
and the inheritance
pattern shown by PKU,

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:29.650
or phenylketonuria.

00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:33.460
So notice here you
have green peas

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.320
in the parental generation.

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:39.610
But green pea skips a generation
and only appears again

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.890
in a subsequent generation.

00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:44.140
So that's a lot
like PKU, where you

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:46.000
can see there's multiple
generations that

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.660
go by where the trait
doesn't manifest itself.

00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:53.890
But then it pops up again in
that later generation where you

00:25:53.890 --> 00:25:58.300
have inbreeding in this family.

00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:03.910
So there's a clear connection
between the results that Mendel

00:26:03.910 --> 00:26:06.340
got and cases of human disease.

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.130
Now we're going to go on and
talk about Mendel's second law.

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:30.640
So Mendel's second
law, which is often

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.650
referred to as the law of
independent assortment.

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:45.930
And another fortuitous
thing in thinking about

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.860
Mendel's experimental design
and setup which was fortuitous--

00:26:49.860 --> 00:26:51.270
he didn't know it at the time--

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:53.370
he chose traits
that actually were

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:57.000
present on different
chromosomes of the pea plant.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.022
So the traits
didn't exhibit what

00:26:59.022 --> 00:27:01.230
is now known as linkage,
where they're are physically

00:27:01.230 --> 00:27:04.740
connected on the chromosome.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.790
So this law of
independent assortment

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:11.970
can also be explained by
thinking about how chromosomes

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:20.760
behave during meiosis, where
the alignment of homologous

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:30.450
chromosomes at the
metaphase plate of meiosis 1

00:27:30.450 --> 00:27:31.620
is essentially random.

00:27:36.210 --> 00:27:39.160
So if we take a look
at this example here,

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.900
you can see I've drawn one
particular configuration

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.390
for the chromosomes.

00:27:45.390 --> 00:27:48.000
And I'm using sort
of one gene pair here

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.160
and another allele pair here.

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.560
And so if the chromosomes
were aligned this way, then

00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.230
when they segregate
during meiosis 1

00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.200
you'd get two
classes of gametes.

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:04.020
Some that are
capital Y, capital R.

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.130
And another class that's
lowercase y and r.

00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.020
So that's one possibility.

00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.430
But what's equally probable
during the alignment

00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:18.690
of chromosomes during meiosis 1
is that the chromosomes line up

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:19.680
like this.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.930
So rather than having
the dominant alleles

00:28:22.930 --> 00:28:25.860
all on one side of
the metaphase plate,

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.690
you have a dominant allele for
one homologous pair on one side

00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:34.230
and the other dominant
alleles on the other side.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.130
So how they arrange, how these
homologous chromosomes arrange

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:41.330
during meiosis is
totally random.

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:43.620
And if they arrange
like this, you'd

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:46.350
get alternative
types of gametes.

00:28:46.350 --> 00:28:49.980
You'd get gametes that are
uppercase Y, lower case

00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:54.960
r, and lower case
y, uppercase R.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.050
So this law of
independent assortment

00:28:58.050 --> 00:29:03.360
can be completely explained by
the behavior of the chromosomes

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:06.630
during meiosis 1.

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:09.870
So now I'm going to take you
through the experiment that

00:29:09.870 --> 00:29:12.140
illustrated this.

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.160
And this type of
experiment is what

00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.885
is known as a dihybrid cross.

00:29:21.910 --> 00:29:25.620
And so a dihybrid
cross is now a cross

00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:29.190
where you're taking plants that
differ in two traits rather

00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:30.480
than just one.

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.730
So di stands for two.

00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:37.140
And in this case, we're going
to consider both pea color.

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:39.680
Again, the pea colors
are yellow and green.

00:29:42.750 --> 00:29:44.830
But now we're also going
to consider p shape.

00:29:48.390 --> 00:29:53.203
So you can have peas that
are round and peas that

00:29:53.203 --> 00:29:53.745
are wrinkled.

00:29:58.572 --> 00:30:00.780
All right, I'm going to make
use of this board again.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:11.910
So let's consider the
round wrinkled case.

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:16.560
If you set up a cross
between a plant that

00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:18.960
was from a round
seed and a plant that

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.460
was from a wrinkled seed--

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:28.980
and let's say the round
allele is dominant,

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:31.050
what would you expect
to see in the F1?

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.235
So you have-- yes, Carlos.

00:30:38.235 --> 00:30:39.110
AUDIENCE: All rounds.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:42.560
ADAM MARTIN: You'd see
all round, exactly right.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:46.190
So let's go through,
now, this cross.

00:30:46.190 --> 00:30:50.750
So we're going to have a
parental cross where Mendel

00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:53.060
took two pure breeding lines.

00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:59.270
One of them has
yellow round peas.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:03.650
And he crossed the plant
from a yellow round pea

00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:06.980
with a plant that was derived
from a green wrinkled pea.

00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:18.290
And we already know
yellow is dominant.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:22.550
And as Carlos just pointed
out, if round is dominant,

00:31:22.550 --> 00:31:26.670
then you'd expect all of the
peas to be round as well.

00:31:26.670 --> 00:31:31.970
So in the F1 generation,
what Mendel found is

00:31:31.970 --> 00:31:36.485
you have 100% of the progeny
that are yellow round peas.

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.870
And then similar to
the monohybrid cross,

00:31:44.870 --> 00:31:50.040
Mendel self-crossed
these F1 plants.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.030
And by self-crossing
them, he observed

00:31:53.030 --> 00:32:05.270
a number of different
classes of progeny.

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:09.670
So he got back the parental
types, yellow round.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:19.660
He also got back this other
parental type, green wrinkled.

00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:33.640
So these, because these were the
same combination of traits that

00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:37.750
were present in at least
one of the original parents,

00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:39.952
are known as perennials.

00:32:39.952 --> 00:32:40.660
They're parental.

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.920
They had the same
parental phenotype as one

00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.690
of the original parents.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:57.040
But what Mendel observed was
two other classes of progeny

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.590
which were different
combinations

00:32:59.590 --> 00:33:02.680
of these traits that weren't
present in the original

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.420
parental generation.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:13.840
So those were yellow wrinkled
peas and green round peas.

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:20.930
So you'll notice that this
combination of traits,

00:33:20.930 --> 00:33:25.610
yellow and wrinkled,
is not present

00:33:25.610 --> 00:33:27.680
in the parental generation.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:29.720
This is all F2.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.180
This is F2 continued.

00:33:32.180 --> 00:33:34.400
You also see green
and round were not

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.780
present in the
parental generation.

00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:40.260
So these are referred to
as being non-parental.

00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:49.670
So this non-parental class
is a unique combination

00:33:49.670 --> 00:33:53.525
of traits that wasn't present
in the original parents.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:34:01.220
And what Mendel noted was
that in these dihybrid crosses

00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:09.530
he always got a stereotypic
ratio of 9 to 3 to 3 to 1

00:34:09.530 --> 00:34:13.880
for these different classes
of combinations of traits.

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.810
Now we have to think
about the probability.

00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:27.670
What leads to this
characteristic ratio?

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:29.550
And again, we can
think about this just

00:34:29.550 --> 00:34:34.530
in terms of probabilities
and these different gene

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:38.170
pairs segregating
independently of each other.

00:34:38.170 --> 00:34:43.440
So we already talked about for a
monohybrid cross for pea color,

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:45.690
3/4 of the progeny is yellow.

00:34:45.690 --> 00:34:53.400
Because they at least have
one dominant allele for color.

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:54.989
And one quarter are green.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.220
So the probability of having
this phenotype is 3/4.

00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.250
The probability of being
green is one quarter.

00:35:05.250 --> 00:35:11.250
And you can consider pea shape
as just a separate monohybrid

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.530
cross where the dominant
phenotype is also

00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:19.500
going to be present
at 3/4 probability.

00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.960
So 3/4 are going to be round.

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:24.315
And one quarter is
going to be wrinkled.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:32.650
So now if we just consider these
different classes of progeny

00:35:32.650 --> 00:35:36.850
here, we can consider
two monohybrid crosses.

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:41.710
And what's the joint probability
of being both yellow and round?

00:35:41.710 --> 00:35:44.980
So the joint probability
of being yellow and round

00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:49.220
is 3/4 times 3/4.

00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:56.800
So if we have 3/4 times 3/4,
that's going to equal 9/16.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:59.380
Now, if we consider
yellow and wrinkled,

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:04.510
that's the joint probability
of 3/4 and one quarter.

00:36:04.510 --> 00:36:09.310
So this probability
is being 3/4 times

00:36:09.310 --> 00:36:13.380
one quarter, which
is equal to 3/16.

00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:16.040
Green and round is similar.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.730
There's a quarter
probability of being green

00:36:18.730 --> 00:36:21.670
and a 3/4 probability
of being round.

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:25.870
So again, you have
one quarter times 3/4,

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.210
which equals to 3/16.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:31.570
And the least probable class
is being homozygous recessive

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.760
for both alleles.

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.880
Because there's a one
quarter probability of being

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:38.710
recessive for each.

00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:42.370
So the joint probability of
having all recessive alleles

00:36:42.370 --> 00:36:45.540
is one quarter times
one quarter, or 1/16.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.260
So you could draw a
massive Punnett square

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:51.880
and also derive this.

00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.740
But really you can
just consider it

00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:57.310
as two separate
monohybrid crosses

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.530
and then just calculate
joint probabilities.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:08.700
Any questions on Mendel
before I move on?

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.510
I'll just point out one thing
about Mendel's second law.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.860
This is a rule that I'm going
to break, now, in just a minute.

00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:20.700
And this law of
independent assortment

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.695
assumes that there
is no linkage.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:33.780
In other words, seeing this
type of inheritance pattern

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.330
really depends on the
two genes not being

00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:39.507
physically connected to each
other on the chromosome.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:51.460
Now we're going to
talk about fruit flies.

00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.040
And specifically,
we're going to talk

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.430
about a certain trait
in fruit flies, which

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:59.680
is their eye color.

00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.160
I brought some pets
to class today.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.420
And so we're going to talk about
the white mutant phenotype,

00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.550
where the fruit flies
have a white eye color.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.150
So I have three
pairs of vials here.

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:15.370
In one of them, there's
the white mutant.

00:38:15.370 --> 00:38:17.740
And you're going to
see it has white eyes.

00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:20.230
And then there's also
a corresponding sort

00:38:20.230 --> 00:38:23.710
of normal red-eyed
flies in the other vial.

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:25.720
So I'll just pass these around.

00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:28.330
Hopefully there's enough light
that you can see the eye color.

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:35.830
You're able to see
the eye color, Jeremy?

00:38:35.830 --> 00:38:37.517
Yeah.

00:38:37.517 --> 00:38:39.100
You might have to
come up to the board

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.642
lights at the end of class if
you want to see it really well.

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.920
So we're going to fast forward
from Mendel now and talk

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:55.940
about researchers who
picked up on Mendel's work

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:58.305
in the early 1900s.

00:38:58.305 --> 00:38:59.930
And specifically,
I'm going to tell you

00:38:59.930 --> 00:39:04.250
about research done in the
lab of Thomas Hunt Morgan, who

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:07.330
had a fly lab at Columbia.

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:10.475
So we're going to talk
about Thomas Hunt Morgan.

00:39:13.453 --> 00:39:14.870
And actually, we're
going to focus

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:18.800
a lot on work done
in Morgan's lab

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:20.300
in the next couple of lectures.

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.730
Because it turns
out his lab also

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:24.650
made the first genetic map.

00:39:24.650 --> 00:39:28.700
And we'll talk about
that in Friday's lecture.

00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:32.030
So the type of inheritance
that Morgan defined

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:39.920
is what is now known as
sex-linked inheritance, where

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.330
a given trait isn't a sorting
independently of an organism's

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:50.040
sex, but is somehow
connected to it.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.320
And I want to sort of
return your attention

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:56.470
to this example of
human colorblindness

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.290
where there appears to be
some sort of connection

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:03.370
between the disease phenotype,
in this case, colorblindness,

00:40:03.370 --> 00:40:06.400
and the gender of
the individuals.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.720
So you see this disease
is only affecting males.

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.090
And this type of
inheritance pattern,

00:40:13.090 --> 00:40:15.040
while observed in
humans, is really

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:19.060
explained by work done in
flies on this white mutant

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:23.020
that you're carrying
through the class.

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:27.310
So sex-linked inheritance, the
explanation for that is this

00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:36.520
is a trait that's carried by
a special type of a chromosome

00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:38.378
known as a sex chromosome.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:46.780
So fortunately, for
us, flies, like humans,

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.280
have a similar set--

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:59.950
or male flies and humans
have an X and a Y chromosome.

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:03.370
So the inheritance kind of
is similar between flies

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.370
and humans when
considering sex linkage.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:07.945
And females have two X's.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.630
So the presence of
these sex chromosomes

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:18.100
was known in the fly.

00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:21.610
And it was known that if a fly
had an X and a Y chromosome

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:23.200
it would be a male fly.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.420
And if a fly had
two X chromosomes

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.480
it would be a female fly.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:36.100
And normally, normal
flies have red eyes.

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:41.800
But Morgan's lab was interested
in variation in organisms.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.490
And they searched and
searched for flies

00:41:45.490 --> 00:41:48.970
that had abnormal
characteristics or traits.

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:54.120
And what they found in
Morgan's lab was a mutant fly.

00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:56.170
It was a spontaneous mutant.

00:41:56.170 --> 00:41:58.780
But this fly had white eyes.

00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:00.050
And it was male.

00:42:00.050 --> 00:42:04.870
So they found a single
white-eyed male,

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:07.570
which they continued
to study for some time.

00:42:07.570 --> 00:42:11.140
So they sort of defined some of
the rules of its inheritance.

00:42:16.650 --> 00:42:19.440
So what Morgan and
his lab did was

00:42:19.440 --> 00:42:24.270
they set up a set
of crosses that look

00:42:24.270 --> 00:42:27.210
a lot like Mendel's crosses.

00:42:27.210 --> 00:42:29.160
So you have a white-eyed male.

00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:30.780
They took a white-eyed male.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:40.395
And they crossed this white-eyed
male to a red-eyed female.

00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:49.890
And if you cross a white-eyed
male to a red-eyed female,

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:54.000
the result was actually similar
to what Mendel had predicted,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.900
which is that 100% of
the flies had red eyes.

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:04.020
So that's similar
to what you would

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:09.550
expect from a monohybrid cross
where red eyes is dominant.

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:12.720
So I'm going to refer to
the red eyed allele as an X

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.170
with a capital R. And
the white-eyed allele is

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.720
an X with a lower case r.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.660
Because this gene is
present on the X chromosome,

00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:25.050
but it's not present
on the Y chromosome.

00:43:25.050 --> 00:43:27.000
So the Y chromosome
is really small.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.390
And so the X chromosome has--

00:43:30.390 --> 00:43:34.380
all of its genes are
basically present in one copy

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.370
in the male.

00:43:35.370 --> 00:43:40.260
And that's going to manifest
itself in that sex linkage.

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:43.560
So then they took
this F1 generation

00:43:43.560 --> 00:43:45.840
where you have red-eyed males.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.040
And they crossed siblings.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.480
So they did a sibling cross.

00:43:51.480 --> 00:43:55.770
The one failing of flies
as a genetic system is they

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:57.870
can't self-cross.

00:43:57.870 --> 00:43:59.880
You have to have a
male and a female.

00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:06.270
So they crossed two individuals
in this F1 generation.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:07.440
And what they found--

00:44:07.440 --> 00:44:10.080
again, similar to what
Mendel would predict--

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:16.890
is that 75% of the
flies had red eyes.

00:44:16.890 --> 00:44:20.130
And 25% had white eyes.

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:27.540
So this is behaving a lot
like the yellow trait in peas.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:32.250
Except that all of the
white-eyed flies in this F2

00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.320
generation--

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:38.340
all of these white-eyed
flies were male.

00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:44.520
So only the males were getting
this trait of white eyes.

00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.770
And you can see that that's
very much reminiscent

00:44:46.770 --> 00:44:52.560
of colorblindness, where
you have a grandfather that

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.690
has white eyes.

00:44:54.690 --> 00:44:56.910
And the grandfather
is essentially

00:44:56.910 --> 00:45:02.070
passing on this trait
to his grandsons.

00:45:02.070 --> 00:45:05.260
So this pattern of inheritance
that happens in the fly

00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:09.360
is very similar to that
that happens in humans.

00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:11.910
So now let's think
about how this--

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:13.830
if we can explain
this by thinking

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.710
about chromosome segregating.

00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:24.330
So if we think about
this F1 generation,

00:45:24.330 --> 00:45:26.320
we have red-eyed males--

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.010
or actually, let's do
the parental cross first,

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:33.180
where we have white-eyed males
and we have red-eyed females.

00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:41.540
So all of the females are going
to get their X from their dad.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:44.290
And they're going to get a
wild type copy of this gene

00:45:44.290 --> 00:45:46.510
from their mom.

00:45:46.510 --> 00:45:48.940
So all the females
are heterozygous

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:51.412
for the white gene.

00:45:51.412 --> 00:45:53.620
So I'm going to call it the
white gene because that's

00:45:53.620 --> 00:45:55.570
what it's called.

00:45:55.570 --> 00:46:02.110
In flies, they name the genes
based on the mutant phenotype.

00:46:02.110 --> 00:46:04.960
So if you mutate it, and it
results in white-eyed flies,

00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:08.080
then they call it
the white gene.

00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.540
All the males are going
to have a functional

00:46:10.540 --> 00:46:13.210
copy of the white gene.

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:16.030
And thus, all of these
F1 flies are red-eyed.

00:46:21.490 --> 00:46:23.710
So now these siblings are mated.

00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:27.550
All the females are
heterozygous for this gene.

00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:34.900
The males all have a
functional copy of the gene.

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:37.380
So they're going to make
gametes that are either

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:45.190
an X that's functional for this
eye color or the Y chromosome.

00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:49.120
So now what you see is
that all of the females

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.738
are going to get this normal
copy of the gene from dad,

00:46:52.738 --> 00:46:54.280
and thus, are going
to have red eyes.

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:00.370
Whereas half the
males are going to get

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:05.350
a functional copy from mom,
and therefore, have red eyes.

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:07.750
But the other half
of the males are

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.750
going to get this
non-functional variant that

00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:13.570
can't produce red
pigment, and therefore,

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:16.240
are going to be white.

00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:20.020
So this here is
your white class.

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:23.770
And you can see because males
only have one X chromosome,

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:27.640
the only class of progeny that's
going to be white-eyed here

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:31.180
are those males that occur
with a quarter frequency.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:42.010
One thing I want you to think
about over the next couple

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:42.610
days--

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:45.040
and I'll sort of
take you through it

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:47.050
at the beginning
of next lecture--

00:47:47.050 --> 00:47:52.180
is what would happen if you
set up a reciprocal cross here?

00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:57.680
What if you mated red-eyed
males to white-eyed females?

00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.960
And I want you to tell me
what you expect would result.

00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.320
So my question for
next Friday is,

00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:11.680
what if you took red-eyed
males and mated it

00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:12.805
to white-eyed females?

00:48:17.950 --> 00:48:19.590
So I want you to
think about this.

00:48:19.590 --> 00:48:23.740
And I want you to think how
this is different from Mendel's

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:24.260
experiment.

00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:28.990
What if you did a reciprocal
cross for, let's say,

00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.330
the pea color?

00:48:31.330 --> 00:48:33.400
How would these two
different crosses

00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.240
compare with each other?

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:38.290
And we'll talk about that at the
beginning of Friday's lecture.

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:42.070
And we'll also talk about
the first genetic map,

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:45.260
which was actually created
by an undergraduate.

00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.110
So stay tuned for that.

00:48:47.110 --> 00:48:49.110
See you on Friday.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.460
PROFESSOR: All right,
so let's get started.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.720
OK, good afternoon.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.760
Finally spring here,
so which means you want

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.030
to be out, not inside a room.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.590
First, we're going to go
over the strategy aspect.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.500
This will give us a chance to
reflect the whole content we

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.280
went through the whole term by
maybe using the idea of setting

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.850
up a strategy to try to connect
the different sessions that

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.540
kind of covered throughout.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.110
And also we're going to
spend some time on the team

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.510
project final deliverable.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.900
I know there's some questions.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.525
You're going to-- you're meeting
with us if you haven't already

00:01:12.525 --> 00:01:13.920
meet already.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.790
And I want to
answer those so you

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.880
are prepared to work
on the final report.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.510
And then on Wednesday, we're
going to hear firsthand

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.630
from EMC on how they think
about sustainability strategy,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.210
the sustainability group.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.870
So the direct order
[INAUDIBLE] the head people,

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.010
they're going to come here.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.840
And you have a chance
to validate and maybe

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.980
get some of your
questions answered

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.250
on how a company actually makes
these happen in a little bit

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.040
larger scale.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.480
STUDENT: If you guys
want to go online too,

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.280
EMC has one of the better
sustainability [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.655
reporting.

00:01:45.655 --> 00:01:47.100
G on their website
and look around

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.558
at what kind of
information they're

00:01:48.558 --> 00:01:50.689
disclosing so you can look
at that relative to what

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:51.730
your company [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.563
Because I would say
they're sort of the game

00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:56.250
and also maybe some questions
to think about Katie

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.197
[? Sindel ?] who will
becoming on Wednesday.

00:01:58.197 --> 00:02:00.280
PROFESSOR: Great, so that's
[INAUDIBLE] little bit

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.170
of the administrative aspect.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.508
So this paper-- who
had read it before?

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.889
Before we assigned it?

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.374
So in the past-- in which
context did you read it?

00:02:14.374 --> 00:02:18.795
STUDENT: It was for a
McKinsey thing I was

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:20.440
on like a while back-- 2007.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.845
PROFESSOR: OK, how about you?

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:22.775
Where did you read it before?

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:23.566
STUDENT: Oh, sorry.

00:02:23.566 --> 00:02:25.090
I thought [INAUDIBLE] class

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.502
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK.

00:02:26.502 --> 00:02:27.960
This actually is
a very good paper.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.710
[INAUDIBLE] this
is actually the one

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.520
I always go back to over time.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.080
Because it has some fundamental
insights that I think

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.550
is worth revisiting.

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.170
This is, even though it's
not written for supply chain

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.990
necessarily-- it's not written
for environmental supply chain

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.490
either.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.800
It's really more general CSR.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.500
But I think some of the
key aspects of this paper

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.300
are, I think, critical
when you have to make

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.150
this happen in practice.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.590
This is very much connected
to what we see and Alexis

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.080
and I have been
talking to people on,

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.770
especially the
pitfalls-- so how people

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.970
address environmental aspects
in their company and beyond.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.260
So why don't we start by who
would like to kind of give me

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.540
a summary of the premise, the
basic premise, that Porter

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.050
puts forward in this article?

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.140
So we'll [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.100
STUDENT: Well, you've got to say
that just the CSR is not enough

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.915
and that people
are going to take

00:03:30.915 --> 00:03:32.600
the CSR as like the
end-all and trying

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.940
to put it in these indexes
without really knowing

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.154
all of the true information.

00:03:36.154 --> 00:03:37.570
So by doing that,
they're actually

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:40.107
kind of going away from
their true goal, which

00:03:40.107 --> 00:03:41.766
is improvement in these areas.

00:03:41.766 --> 00:03:47.440
So it's kind of looking at
what are different ways that

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.689
aside from this generally
accepted [INAUDIBLE] that we

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.150
can use to get
companies to focus more

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.905
on the social aspect,
social responsibility.

00:03:55.905 --> 00:03:57.430
PROFESSOR: OK, that's one.

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.940
Would you like to add
something to that?

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.020
STUDENT: It advocates for
moving from corporate social

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.750
responsibility towards
corporate social integration

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:14.220
and also that sometimes
this companies

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.360
spread their resources too
thin [INAUDIBLE] NGO demands

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.360
or kind of external pressures
that aren't necessarily that

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.440
integral to their supply chain.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.180
[INAUDIBLE] perhaps
have more of an impact

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.478
if they focus on one
area in particular.

00:04:38.382 --> 00:04:41.152
PROFESSOR: Let me see if I can
get those three ideas here.

00:04:41.152 --> 00:04:45.750
One is the, I guess focus
too much on the stakeholders.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.200
We'll talk a little bit
more about that one.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.600
They integrate to the
business I guess [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.808
what you were saying as well.

00:04:50.808 --> 00:04:53.480
So [INAUDIBLE] the index traps
is one of the stakeholders.

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.880
And this is not a
trivial problem.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.490
And let me just
relate back-- I'm

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:03.970
not sure I can tell the
full company name yet.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.570
But soon we will.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.530
So we were talking about
other major, major companies.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.600
And we were asking
them, how do you

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.990
start your green
sustainability strategy?

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:16.520
They said, we did this.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.330
We went to all the indexes
that were out there that

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.010
were ranking companies.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.890
We looked exactly at why
they were ranking as well.

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:29.580
And then we started
addressing, they give us

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.470
like a guiding post we wanted
to achieve, want to be number

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.350
one in all those indexes.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.490
And then we look at what was the
feedback they were providing us

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.650
and we work at it.

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.590
And we're doing very well.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.464
They're ranked much better,
of course, than before.

00:05:46.464 --> 00:05:47.880
But this is
specifically addressed

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.970
in this Porter article
specifically advises

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:52.910
against that.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.940
So it advises against it
in multiple dimensions.

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.100
One dimension is, you
know, these indexes

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:59.840
are convoluted, right?

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.050
But there's a
fundamental, I guess,

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.040
problem is that this doesn't go
beyond what your company does.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.990
It's what somebody
else cares about,

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.620
not what your
company cares about.

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.920
And the indexes, though they are
the most visible part, that's

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.100
not really is not going to be
there to stay, I think, yeah?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:19.990
That's really the thing is it's
not that it's bad to use them.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.440
It's just that if you think
that's the ultimate goal,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.410
you will never be able to go the
momentum beyond the CSR head.

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:28.450
Whomever started
this project, great.

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:30.300
They're going to be
able to move this ahead.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.730
But once this person leaves
or the company changes,

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.640
to this is going to be gone.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.850
This could be five years.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.430
This could be seven years.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.352
That's unknown, but
that's, I think,

00:06:41.352 --> 00:06:42.560
one of the ultimate problems.

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.170
So I want to list--
to tell that story.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.730
But focus too much
on the stakeholder.

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:52.300
And so you had a third idea
but I forgot what it was.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.800
You forgot?

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:53.793
STUDENT: I forget too.

00:06:53.793 --> 00:06:54.626
PROFESSOR: OK, good.

00:06:54.626 --> 00:06:56.980
That's good Anything
else that you

00:06:56.980 --> 00:07:01.050
think were the key messages
from this articles that

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.755
are not those three?

00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:05.460
STUDENT: I thought
the way he wrote down

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:07.530
four different types of CRS.

00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.250
So there was the
license to operate,

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.970
the [INAUDIBLE] obligation,
sustainability, and [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I think
taht's pretty good too.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.594
And the reason I
think it's pretty good

00:07:18.594 --> 00:07:21.190
is because most of us, the first
time we think through this,

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.910
these are the four that come
to mind of why a company do it.

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.295
So one is a moral argument.

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:33.070
The other one was the
license to operate argument.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.940
The other one that is maybe
the one that we even within MIT

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:42.080
we talk about more is the
sustainability argument.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:44.985
And the third one
is the reputation.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.050
Who remembers why those four
key claims are incomplete?

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.550
It's not that they're wrong.

00:07:56.550 --> 00:08:01.150
It's that they were incomplete
to capture the true motivation

00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.390
and meaning to drive and move
change in an organization

00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:06.456
towards CSR or sustainability.

00:08:06.456 --> 00:08:08.080
So let's talk about
the moral argument.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.750
What was the main
problem of using

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:15.070
a moral view of the world to
say, this is what we should do?

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:17.370
This is the good
thing for us to do.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.518
This is why our
business you do it.

00:08:20.518 --> 00:08:23.010
STUDENT: It wasn't
very easily measurable.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.360
PROFESSOR: Number one is
measurement, which is always

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.670
going to be a challenge, right?

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.680
So, measurement.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.589
So what was the problem
with the moral--

00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:35.630
what was the problem with
the measurement aspect?

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.296
Not easily measurable,
that's one thing.

00:08:37.296 --> 00:08:39.220
But what does he mean by that?

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:41.011
STUDENT: I think there
are some things that

00:08:41.011 --> 00:08:44.850
are kind of like a [INAUDIBLE]
a great area [INAUDIBLE] you

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.770
do one thing, but you kind of
destroy value in another area.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.719
And how do you actually
get that to mesh?

00:08:51.719 --> 00:08:53.135
PROFESSOR: Yes,
so the measurement

00:08:53.135 --> 00:08:55.150
is that we all as
individuals, we probably

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:56.780
have our own moral values.

00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:02.670
And when we decide, should I
take that extra piece of coke--

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:05.070
I paid for one drink,
I want to top it off.

00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:07.960
You put, like, a little
bit more than you paid for.

00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:09.850
You do, like, a moral
analysis, right?

00:09:09.850 --> 00:09:11.395
And you do it internally
in the [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:09:11.395 --> 00:09:13.340
You say, well, you know,
last time I had less.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.490
So maybe on average,
I'm consuming

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.057
the right amount of soda.

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.640
And I'm OK with going
back to the line

00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.540
and getting soda even
though I paid for one drink.

00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:21.790
It's like a moral choice, hm?

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.240
And you do it at the
individual level.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.100
It's easy maybe to do those
tradeoffs because they're not

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:25.830
quantifiable.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:27.910
But if you go like
a big company--

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:30.170
they use the example
of Google-- you

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.730
have two different
moral choices, right?

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:34.200
There's one-- openness.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.600
You want freedom.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.100
But on the hand, you
also want to give access

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.140
to people to technology.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.730
So how do you balance those two?

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:42.790
And when you cannot
measure things,

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:46.980
it all becomes a choice that
is of leadership or some sort.

00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.230
And you cannot translate
that into business over time.

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:49.730
That's one.

00:09:49.730 --> 00:09:51.500
The other thing is
the moral compass

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.820
changes-- changes from
one place to the other,

00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:56.280
from one context to the other.

00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.910
How can a company
be run that way?

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.530
It's not that morality is not
part of the business decisions,

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:04.950
but rather making that the
main driving force for CSR

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:06.976
does not allow you to
do trade offs property.

00:10:06.976 --> 00:10:09.350
That's kind of what his main
argument was-- a measurement

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.100
aspect.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.550
Lack of measurement is
reality on moral decisions.

00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:15.360
But you cannot make
the trade offs.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.970
And businesses are
all about trade offs.

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:20.450
That was one of his main
I'd say counter arguments.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:21.560
So that's morality.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.580
License to operate--

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.610
STUDENT: He said that
they don't take--

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:30.840
so as you're trying to look good
in the eyes of the community

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:36.170
you operate in, you are
[INAUDIBLE] to their requests

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.890
by you're not taking it
into account how you operate

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.830
and what your competitive
advantages are.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:43.820
PROFESSOR: Yes,
there's a dichotomy

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.990
between your capabilities
and what these community

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.610
wants, right?

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.015
So that's not
taken into account.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:03.096
Also, this goes back--
he talks in there

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:04.720
about different
context as well, right?

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.520
The context [INAUDIBLE].

00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.000
Reputation-- this is
the interesting one.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.310
Because actually, I
spent a lot of time

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:14.410
on trying to look
for this information.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:19.900
What was the main argument
against the reputation

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:23.660
kind of bad approach
for justifying CRS?

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:24.410
Someone remembers?

00:11:29.867 --> 00:11:31.450
STUDENT: A lot of
times, it can just--

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:32.410
PROFESSOR: Very quickly.

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.910
STUDENT: --just a
marketing campaign

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:37.020
instead of like a true
measure of what they're doing.

00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.080
Like, so they're just--

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:41.422
PROFESSOR: There's
something more fundamental.

00:11:41.422 --> 00:11:42.880
It's true, it's a
bit of marketing.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:45.330
But it's not proven.

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:47.670
See, there's not
even-- we are not

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:50.530
able to find real evidence
that this actually works,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.450
that this branding creates
business value, which

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.689
is very surprising.

00:11:56.689 --> 00:11:58.730
But it's surprising because
in the companies that

00:11:58.730 --> 00:12:01.940
are willing to do
it very well, it's

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.650
hard to differentiate how much
is brand, how much is business.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:09.500
How do you make that argument?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:12.770
And I think we tried several
times, [? Alexis, ?] to find

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.190
some good studies that
show that being greener

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:21.090
gives you better return over
investment or business value.

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:23.540
But actually, most of the
studies have it reverse.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:25.800
They say, well, companies
that are doing great,

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.780
they tend to be greener,
right, or more sustainable.

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:30.900
But you can never find
the other argument.

00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.100
So doesn't mean that
there's no value in it.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.200
It's just hard to
distinguish that value

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.260
from the normal operation
of the business.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.940
So even if you try
to go that path,

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:44.010
you will not ever get a good
sense of how good value they

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.790
will give you, which
goes back to why

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:47.080
will you even choose to do it?

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:50.780
When the times get tough
and you have to cut budgets,

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.290
how can justify doing this?

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.606
I mean, he always
thinks on how businesses

00:12:54.606 --> 00:12:55.480
should do this later.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:58.660
So a little bit of
the value of marketing

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.604
is unclear value of brand.

00:13:01.604 --> 00:13:03.705
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
do it the opposite way

00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:06.920
that if you got attacked
like in the case of Nestle

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.000
and-- Nestle and Kit
Kat situation when

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.840
there was the Greenpeace
attacks and we

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.940
wanted to see the stop dip.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:17.731
And it maybe went down
a few cents for one day

00:13:17.731 --> 00:13:18.355
and evened out.

00:13:18.355 --> 00:13:21.130
So unfortunately, even
the reverse is not true.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:23.660
PROFESSOR: The only example
we found which actually

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:27.660
is the scary example, the
only one was Nike, probably,

00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:28.910
back in the labor market.

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:31.350
That's the only example
that has been documented

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.735
that is closer correlated
between the attacks

00:13:34.735 --> 00:13:38.220
that they had on labor and
the actual stock value.

00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:40.860
But there were other factors
going on in that time.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:44.290
But that was enough to scare
people across the world, which

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:44.790
is good.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:45.700
I'm not saying this
is a bad thing,

00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.320
but he argues that
it's not enough.

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:48.970
And then we go to
sustainability.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:50.730
That-- what's the
argument he uses

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.603
for sustainability not
being a good driving force?

00:13:53.603 --> 00:13:56.786
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] There's
not a lot of basis for it

00:13:56.786 --> 00:14:02.250
and it can also lead to
misunderstanding the long term

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.126
cost for short term gains.

00:14:10.030 --> 00:14:12.350
PROFESSOR: So it's vague.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:16.110
So the definition is great,
but what is the long term?

00:14:16.110 --> 00:14:18.190
I mean, how long
is the long term?

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:20.800
How am I trading
off the long term?

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.280
Is this 10 years?

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.430
Is this 100 years?

00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:24.630
Is this 50 years?

00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.495
But I have to make decisions
now and evaluate it now.

00:14:27.495 --> 00:14:29.370
And if I always have to
make these trade offs

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:33.410
long term and short
term, the natural path

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:36.420
is going to be
postponed the long term.

00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:38.840
And you could just postpone
it, postpone it, postpone it.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.990
And it's hard to make
it, on a regular basis,

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:44.310
a decision of the short
term because it's so vague.

00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:46.630
Not know that it's
the wrong framework,

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.700
but it's too undefined.

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:55.030
I think those more or less were
the four arguments, roughly

00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:58.860
speaking, that were outlining
in the wrong reasons

00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:00.700
to do stability.

00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.820
However, you talk to people,
these are easier to explain.

00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.760
Look at it any CEO's pitch.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.610
All of them, if someone
is in operations,

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:14.730
they talk about this license to
operate-- like risk [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:14.730 --> 00:15:16.250
a little bit of risk.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:18.350
Risk management is very
easy to understand.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.933
If I don't do the
right thing, they're

00:15:19.933 --> 00:15:23.360
going to kick me out of
China or out of Brazil.

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:26.050
That's a very, very
natural way to do it.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:30.190
This also touches people.

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:33.360
That's a good way to get
a rallying cry for change.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.090
This, of course, is just
as the overall-- I guess

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:44.000
is the overall trend that you
in general by NGOs and media

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.280
and actually ourselves
here in academia.

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:49.700
And reputation is
another risk argument.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.360
And it's very well understood.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.970
You can bring it
into your company.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:55.054
But all of those
four, he basically

00:15:55.054 --> 00:15:56.720
says those should not
be the right ones.

00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.245
OK, so that's kind of the
summary of the bad things that

00:16:00.245 --> 00:16:00.870
were happening.

00:16:00.870 --> 00:16:04.170
So he proposes a
specific framework

00:16:04.170 --> 00:16:06.680
to try to think about this.

00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.900
So who would like to kind of
give the idea of framework

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:11.420
he proposes?

00:16:13.764 --> 00:16:14.680
[INAUDIBLE] remembers?

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:16.280
Doesn't this table?

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:23.390
I think the table is in page 18.

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:27.290
It says how to
prioritize social issues.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.255
And he talks about
two types of CSR.

00:16:31.255 --> 00:16:34.820
Well, it's actually the other
one-- it's page nine, probably,

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:35.822
is a little bit better.

00:16:35.822 --> 00:16:41.020
Page nine, he talks about
these generic social impacts,

00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.840
value chain social impacts,
and social dimensions

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.650
of competitive context.

00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:50.500
As you can, I always say Porter
is really good with words.

00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:54.210
Social dimensions of competitive
context-- pretty good.

00:16:54.210 --> 00:16:57.210
But those three
once basically are

00:16:57.210 --> 00:16:59.970
the way he proposes you
should think about this.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.310
So let me see-- who ventures
to try to make sense

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.740
of these three dimensions?

00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:09.042
Some one?

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:14.784
Guesses?

00:17:14.784 --> 00:17:17.200
Sorry, [? Gosa? ?] We have
someone [INAUDIBLE] [? Gosa? ?]

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:19.722
Two people?

00:17:19.722 --> 00:17:21.430
No one is venturing
yes, someone venture.

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:22.730
Go ahead.

00:17:22.730 --> 00:17:23.560
Save the day.

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] answer.

00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:38.340
PROFESSOR: The
answer is no answer?

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.932
[INAUDIBLE] So what he
basically-- yeah, go ahead.

00:17:42.932 --> 00:17:55.326
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] say that
there are [INAUDIBLE] should

00:17:55.326 --> 00:17:56.775
be more integrated.

00:17:56.775 --> 00:18:03.780
So a typical
response [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:09.760
to be more responsible and
to be [INAUDIBLE] in a way

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:15.760
[INAUDIBLE] dimension
and something that

00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:20.600
goes beyond just the response
to the sentiment of society

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:27.446
[INAUDIBLE] to bring [INAUDIBLE]
further in a [INAUDIBLE] way

00:18:27.446 --> 00:18:29.891
to operate [INAUDIBLE]
responsibility [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:31.602
And I will give an example.

00:18:31.602 --> 00:18:36.970
Like, for example, there's a
positive [INAUDIBLE] for me.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:39.450
It means that they
have this strategy

00:18:39.450 --> 00:18:44.274
of not only, for example,
being a zero carbon [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:44.274 --> 00:18:47.070
but they want to go
beyond it and [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.420
than they virtually consume
in their [INAUDIBLE] homes

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:52.604
and so have a net positive
impact in the end.

00:18:52.604 --> 00:18:56.232
So for me,
[INAUDIBLE] like this.

00:18:56.232 --> 00:18:57.940
PROFESSOR: So there
we have-- on one end,

00:18:57.940 --> 00:18:59.620
we have the good
citizenship, I guess.

00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.090
But what does he
really mean here?

00:19:02.090 --> 00:19:04.600
Is it-- could you
say that again?

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.324
Maybe I missed.

00:19:06.324 --> 00:19:07.740
What is the position
for a company

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:08.800
in the good citizenship--

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.633
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.755
PROFESSOR: It's a
little bit of saying,

00:19:13.755 --> 00:19:16.180
do nothing, but do
nothing responsibly.

00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:18.240
So basically, do nothing.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.050
You know, just take
a look at stuff.

00:19:22.050 --> 00:19:23.230
Just do the basics.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:25.020
Just stay there.

00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:26.270
Stay there.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:28.430
Definitely have
a code of conduct

00:19:28.430 --> 00:19:30.242
on how to do labor practices.

00:19:30.242 --> 00:19:32.200
But you don't have to
make these something very

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.283
important in your company.

00:19:33.283 --> 00:19:35.320
You just have to make
sure people understand

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.490
what expectations are,
have the minimal compliance

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:40.965
in some sense, and just
do the right thing.

00:19:40.965 --> 00:19:42.560
It's like what we do every day.

00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:44.460
Comply with the laws.

00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:47.202
Maybe you do not-- you're
not looking actively

00:19:47.202 --> 00:19:48.660
to see how these
laws are changing.

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:50.350
You just do them.

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:52.810
That's a bit on the left side.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.686
Why is this hard
for companies to do?

00:19:54.686 --> 00:19:55.310
STUDENT: Sorry.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.166
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:58.150
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
I was saying,

00:19:58.150 --> 00:20:00.450
being like a good
citizen means, like,

00:20:00.450 --> 00:20:04.400
trying to avoid adverse
effects from the business.

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.030
PROFESSOR: So just
avoidance-- avoidance

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:09.120
of effects on the business.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:14.890
So just make sure you
don't end up in jail, eh?

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:19.240
Which is-- this doesn't do
for a good marketing campaign.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.759
So we're going to avoid to
be in jail on labor issues.

00:20:21.759 --> 00:20:24.050
We're going to avoid to be
in jail on carbon footprint.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.770
I mean, that's why companies
don't talk about this that way.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:28.830
Because you have to.

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:30.290
It's not that sexy.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.540
So that's on one spectrum.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.660
So this is a little
bit of say no.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:37.765
Say no thanks.

00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.980
So say no, I'm not going to
try to solve this problem.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:47.190
I am aware of it.

00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:50.010
I recognize it and
I'm going to try

00:20:50.010 --> 00:20:52.290
to do what the basic
[INAUDIBLE] but I'm really

00:20:52.290 --> 00:20:55.962
not going to spend resources
or time trying to do this, hm?

00:20:55.962 --> 00:21:00.582
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] that is
just avoiding the [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:00.582 --> 00:21:02.420
while doing [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:07.090
Because [INAUDIBLE]
it's also [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:07.090 --> 00:21:12.630
to being to address
consequences of [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:15.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so he talks
about it in a little bit

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:16.460
of the next stage.

00:21:16.460 --> 00:21:19.450
He says there's
generic social impacts.

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:21.640
And then he has these
value chain social impacts.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.840
So there'll be some
of those that will

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.420
be closer to your business.

00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.885
So there's a few
of them that may

00:21:27.885 --> 00:21:30.390
be not as distant as others.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:33.580
But the ones that are a bit
closer, then definitely I

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.030
want to mitigate.

00:21:35.030 --> 00:21:36.730
So in a little bit,
then, they move

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:39.640
to say, no thanks,
to mitigate risk.

00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:44.530
But you're right.

00:21:44.530 --> 00:21:49.760
In some sense, you want to list
them down and have some sort

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:50.940
of conscious decision.

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:52.890
And I think this
is-- anyone that

00:21:52.890 --> 00:21:56.130
has studied strategy
knows that strategy is not

00:21:56.130 --> 00:21:57.592
what you decide to do.

00:21:57.592 --> 00:21:59.050
It's what most of
the time you make

00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:01.280
sure you are not going to do.

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:03.920
I'm not going to try to--
it's hard sometimes to say,

00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.720
I'm not going to
do this or that.

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:09.250
But someone, when you have
a good strategy your head,

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:10.240
you know-- this issue?

00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:12.470
I know it's important, but I'm
not going to try to tackle it.

00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:13.900
That's a little bit of what
the [INAUDIBLE] is trying

00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:16.660
to put forward here is
that you, even though it's

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:20.635
hard to say no to one of these
issues, you have to say no.

00:22:20.635 --> 00:22:23.760
Because you cannot
solve them all.

00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:25.280
That's the one end.

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:27.580
And then on the other
end, we have the more--

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:29.220
we call strategic CSR.

00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.900
This is what he
calls responsiveness,

00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:32.860
I guess responsive CSR.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:36.070
That is on the
framework of try to say

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:40.120
no to try to mitigate risk.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:43.240
And on the other hand, you
have the strategic CSR aspects

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:43.740
of it.

00:22:48.210 --> 00:22:53.350
Those are the ones that
you have to say yes to.

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.620
You say yes to in
two different ways.

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.900
One is the-- I think you
were saying earlier--

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.510
is the one that tries to
create new competitiveness

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:05.992
dimensions as a company.

00:23:05.992 --> 00:23:09.590
I think they use Whole
Foods as one example.

00:23:09.590 --> 00:23:10.860
This is my competitiveness.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.420
Like, my [INAUDIBLE]
organic food

00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:14.660
and I'm engaged with consumers.

00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:16.570
I'm engaged with
the community and I

00:23:16.570 --> 00:23:18.460
do everything just
to position myself

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:21.420
as a completely different
retailer where people can find

00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.570
certain goods, where
people can actually

00:23:25.570 --> 00:23:28.950
not only get their products,
but help the community.

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.420
And they attract a
certain kind of market.

00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:33.870
And everything sustainability
around Whole Foods

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:36.785
is really tied to not
only their values,

00:23:36.785 --> 00:23:39.795
but it's how they see
themselves competing.

00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.730
Most people-- Whole
Foods prides themselves

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:50.450
that whenever there's a Whole
Foods in a neighborhood,

00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:53.830
the real estate values increase.

00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:58.237
Because this is like a
source of change, hm?

00:23:58.237 --> 00:23:59.320
And they compete that way.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.200
And every green
environmental dimension

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.010
is tied to that competitiveness.

00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:10.370
But they also very
much so charge more.

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.380
Now, most people cannot
afford Whole Foods.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.900
So it's not the only value
proposition that a retailer can

00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:21.760
have. [INAUDIBLE] other
that are different-- scales

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.830
and just other things we
will talk about later.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:27.436
But that's the example
of a strategic CSR.

00:24:27.436 --> 00:24:29.060
And there's another--
he actually talks

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:30.570
about another example there.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:34.590
And we saw this-- we were
talking with Siemens.

00:24:34.590 --> 00:24:38.860
And I think you can help me
here with some of the Siemens

00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:39.940
vision.

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:44.780
So Siemens, they do all
kinds of electrical equipment

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:47.130
for big power plants.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:53.330
So for them, green energy is
the business of the future.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:55.700
So they decided,
we're going to sell

00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.320
all kinds of hydro wind energy.

00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:03.430
And they put lots of effort
into trying to sell this

00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:04.600
to other companies.

00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.050
But the only way you
can sell this outside

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:08.360
is if you use it inside.

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:11.440
If you don't have good energy
practices in your company,

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.980
you cannot sell the
product outside.

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:17.870
So for them, it became quickly
a transformation of the culture

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:20.350
and trying to do a much better
job with their own suppliers

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:22.150
in energy management.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:23.690
Because that's the
only way you can

00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:29.380
justify that future positioning
of selling wind energy

00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:32.940
and selling the future energy
solutions for the world.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:34.719
You have to sell new
products and then

00:25:34.719 --> 00:25:36.260
you have to work on
your supply chain

00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.080
to be as energy efficient as
the products yo want to sell.

00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:42.640
So they kind of transformed
their CSR and their supply

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:45.875
chain environmental practices,
focusing on energy reduction

00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:49.470
and energy savings, because
this was fully aligned

00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:50.900
to how they wanted to compute.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:52.590
GE is also mentioned,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:53.920
imagination projects.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.400
You hear about GE.

00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.740
Same thing-- they
see it as the future.

00:25:57.740 --> 00:26:00.350
People are buying these
products so my company also

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:02.830
has to be very good at
mentioning energy use

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.930
and saving energy
throughout my manufacturing

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:08.230
plants and my suppliers and
my suppliers' suppliers.

00:26:08.230 --> 00:26:10.470
I need to be consistent
because this helps

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:12.740
my positioning of my brand.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.490
And also, these suppliers
are going to be my customers.

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.840
If I sell energy
solutions and my supplier

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.840
needs to improve their energy,
they'll buy my products.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.379
So they had a bit of a
virtue circle, I guess.

00:26:25.379 --> 00:26:26.420
Toyota is the same thing.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:31.470
Toyota, they mentioned here
in the case in the article.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.080
Now, there is-- the
other group they

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.750
call here is called
transform value chain

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:43.190
activities to benefit society
while reinforcing a strategy.

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:44.980
That's a mouthful.

00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:46.792
What does it mean?

00:26:46.792 --> 00:26:49.125
STUDENT: I think-- well, it
gives the example of Nestle.

00:26:49.125 --> 00:26:51.065
And he's just talking
about fully integrating

00:26:51.065 --> 00:26:54.325
whatever your CSR
priorities are into how

00:26:54.325 --> 00:26:56.160
you do business every day.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:57.850
And that's what Nestle does.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.500
They work with small farmers.

00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:02.740
And so their impact
is fully integrated

00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.870
into their company strategy.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.600
PROFESSOR: So it's just,
so what you do, do it well.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:08.725
And do it well sustainably.

00:27:08.725 --> 00:27:10.820
So Nestle is a great example.

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:14.800
UPS-- who's working with UPS
and FedEx in their-- so UPS,

00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:16.350
another great example.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:20.670
So UPS, they also have
what-- the business

00:27:20.670 --> 00:27:27.890
of packaging on the distance
is a very thin margin business.

00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:31.700
Every single decision you
make that saves-- especially

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.950
at the scale of Fedex or UPS
or any of these packaging

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:36.610
companies, any
gallon of fuel you

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:39.510
save in one route multiplied
by the number of routes

00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:43.470
you run by every day multiplied
by the number of routes

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:46.950
per year, it's millions and
millions of dollars of savings.

00:27:46.950 --> 00:27:49.730
And if you do it well,
your business runs better.

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.980
And what they have
embraced sustainability

00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.100
is to connect it to
that particular thing.

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.540
We are going to save
fuel to the nth degree

00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:58.580
in every single operation we do.

00:27:58.580 --> 00:28:00.630
And this connects with
what they do very well.

00:28:00.630 --> 00:28:02.171
That is logistics
and transportation.

00:28:02.171 --> 00:28:06.060
So that's kind of about another
example of look at what you do

00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.600
and what you do
that matters to you.

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.230
You're going to do it as
sustainably or whatever

00:28:11.230 --> 00:28:12.945
the dimension as possible.

00:28:12.945 --> 00:28:14.680
You're going to
leverage what you're

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.290
good at to try to expand and
make it sustainable in some way

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:20.350
or another.

00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:23.570
And transform that function
into a competitive advantage.

00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:25.310
That's kind the
idea that he has.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:26.610
There's a problem with
all of this, though.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.068
We'll talk about
the problem later.

00:28:28.068 --> 00:28:31.970
But that's the strategic CSR.

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:33.800
It's strategic because
you see a new market

00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.010
coming or strategic because you
have core competence in the way

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:39.180
you run your business.

00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:43.670
And because of that, you
should spend time there

00:28:43.670 --> 00:28:44.910
and do it better.

00:28:44.910 --> 00:28:48.140
I think that that's
the basics, the way

00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.330
I like to see his article.

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:53.760
And if you ever go to
a company or-- this

00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.409
is a good one to keep around.

00:28:55.409 --> 00:28:57.700
[INAUDIBLE] to go back to it
and read it multiple times

00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:58.940
over your lifetime.

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:04.100
So before you lose your
access to the MIT libraries,

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:05.420
have it print a copy.

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:07.780
Or you have to pay--
how much is it? $6.99?

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:10.720
Well, you'll have the
budgets in the future.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.700
But let's look a little more
about what-- anything else

00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:19.167
that I have not covered on the
basic messages of this article

00:29:19.167 --> 00:29:21.250
that someone would like
to highlight that maybe he

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:24.160
mentions at the end?

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.510
No?

00:29:26.510 --> 00:29:27.438
All right.

00:29:27.438 --> 00:29:29.830
STUDENT: I just wanted
to make a comment.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.585
PROFESSOR: Yeah

00:29:30.585 --> 00:29:33.200
STUDENT: I'm taking a marketing
class, a branding class right

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:33.700
now.

00:29:33.700 --> 00:29:37.420
And the main takeaway
I got from here that's

00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:39.940
synonymous with what we're
learning in our branding class

00:29:39.940 --> 00:29:41.620
is DNA.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.700
What we see in a lot of
different case studies

00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.318
we've read is that when a
company doesn't incorporate

00:29:48.318 --> 00:29:51.126
the brand new message
and the attributes

00:29:51.126 --> 00:29:54.695
of-- the key attributes of
the company into their DNA,

00:29:54.695 --> 00:29:56.656
then they fall short
and they're less

00:29:56.656 --> 00:29:58.690
competitive against other
people who do it well.

00:29:58.690 --> 00:30:00.860
And so that's kind
of what I see.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:03.346
He's actually saying
that if you're

00:30:03.346 --> 00:30:06.330
going to position yourself
and integrate yourself

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:09.600
as this environmental
conscious company,

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.955
make sure you've intertwining
within the DNA of your company

00:30:12.955 --> 00:30:19.686
and don't just do it to
address some hot issue that's

00:30:19.686 --> 00:30:22.880
in the news at
this point in time

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.720
or that it sounds
favorable because it's

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:26.990
the flavor of the month.

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:30.390
Make sure that you integrate
it in everything that you do.

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:33.835
And then that will
have a huge benefit

00:30:33.835 --> 00:30:36.595
to your company in the
short term and long term.

00:30:36.595 --> 00:30:40.070
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
there's also the DNA which

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:44.310
when you hear people explaining
it is kind of sounds funny.

00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:47.350
But it's really the crux.

00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:50.147
Now, what does he mean
to make it happen?

00:30:50.147 --> 00:30:51.480
So this is very strategic level.

00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:53.230
We're going to talk a
little bit about it.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:54.296
OK, great.

00:30:54.296 --> 00:30:56.170
Now put it into my DNA,
how to put in my DNA.

00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.940
But let's look at a few
things that are not here

00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:06.060
explicitly mentioned on the list
that I believe are important.

00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:10.270
So even though he doesn't
talk about this in this paper

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:15.900
specifically, he really doesn't
talk much about the life cycle

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:18.110
view of products and services.

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:21.620
Not that-- because it's
[INAUDIBLE] CSR in general.

00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.590
So I think that's been much
more developed since this

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.320
was published.

00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.480
But this idea that
you really need

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.240
to think of the life cycle
of a product or a service

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:38.730
to try to inform this process
I guess is a specific, I guess,

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:41.380
tool or at least view
of the world that

00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.880
helps inform this process.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.490
Because how do you
inform which areas

00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:50.170
you can prioritize or not is
not very well determined here.

00:31:50.170 --> 00:31:51.630
That's one thing.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:54.260
And as a consequence of
that, if you remember

00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.550
from life cycle and all
the things we've heard,

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:59.360
is that most of the emissions
of any single company,

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:01.000
actually-- it doesn't matter
which company you look at--

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.460
are not within your
company, right?

00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:05.860
They're always in your suppliers
or your customers, which

00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:09.919
creates a more importance to
make those external connections

00:32:09.919 --> 00:32:10.960
as part of your strategy.

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:13.310
I think he does mention
it here in some places.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.950
But I think he was not as
clear because of the scope

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.340
of this particular paper.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.845
It was too CSR generic.

00:32:20.845 --> 00:32:22.720
When talking about
environmental, even social

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.914
aspects, most of the impacts
are outside your company

00:32:25.914 --> 00:32:28.080
just because of the way the
companies are structure.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.570
When you have a
life cycle view, you

00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:33.330
have to put more emphasis in
those external connections,

00:32:33.330 --> 00:32:35.800
more than maybe he
tries to portray

00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.990
in this particular
article, which

00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.520
is why we talk
about supply chain,

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:42.200
let's say, as an enabler
of this strategy.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.940
But the priorities
of the high level

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.530
need to be connected
to the same principles.

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.470
But this lack of emphasis on the
life cycle view on your supply

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.580
chain I think is the
one thing that I believe

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:52.580
is a little bit lacking.

00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.630
But let's look at page
five and take a look

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:58.030
at that diagram of page five.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.485
I think that diagram of page
five looks awfully familiar

00:33:01.485 --> 00:33:04.760
or at least should look awfully
familiar except that ours

00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:05.430
is prettier.

00:33:05.430 --> 00:33:07.250
Actually, his is prettier.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.530
So you have all the functions of
the firm, the same thing we had

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:13.970
on our day one on the class.

00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:18.390
And he has, like this inbound
logistics on the left side

00:33:18.390 --> 00:33:19.970
as the function to
bring things in.

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.940
And he has as well
some ideas that you

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:24.430
have [INAUDIBLE] looking
inside out aspect of it--

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:26.650
transportation, emissions,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:28.320
Then you have operations.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.559
You have emissions and waste.

00:33:29.559 --> 00:33:31.100
These are kind of
the things that you

00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.770
think you should look for inside
your company for inspiration

00:33:33.770 --> 00:33:36.100
of where to take action.

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:38.230
You have [INAUDIBLE] logistics.

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.920
He has packaging
use and disposal.

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.389
Then you have
marketing and sales.

00:33:42.389 --> 00:33:43.305
This more advertising.

00:33:43.305 --> 00:33:45.770
And information is more
about communication.

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:47.800
And you have the
after sale services

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.950
and you have your disposal
of obsolete products,

00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:55.047
handling of consumables, some
of the dimensions to look at.

00:33:55.047 --> 00:33:56.630
Then you have the
procurement function

00:33:56.630 --> 00:34:00.740
that, in the view of a
company and the strategy

00:34:00.740 --> 00:34:02.540
specifically the
way Porter likes

00:34:02.540 --> 00:34:05.070
to think about value
chains, he sees procurement

00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:08.159
as a about supporting function
for all these functions.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:09.860
And he lists on
the right side-- he

00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:13.370
talks about use of
particular inputs

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:15.210
and have this bullet
of utilization

00:34:15.210 --> 00:34:17.239
of natural resources.

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.179
So all these kind of
bullets here in this diagram

00:34:20.179 --> 00:34:23.940
are the area you should
look for-- things

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.110
to include in your
strategy, I guess,

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:27.820
and prioritize one
over the other.

00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:31.980
So you could choose and work
more on reducing of packaging.

00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.260
That's what you could do.

00:34:33.260 --> 00:34:35.530
All these are levers
that you can somehow

00:34:35.530 --> 00:34:38.679
engage that are aligned with
what you do as a company.

00:34:38.679 --> 00:34:40.670
And if you go through
this list, you

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:43.909
will see very quickly that
there's some things that you

00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:47.170
see all over the place happening
that make sense to companies.

00:34:47.170 --> 00:34:49.200
So let's start with one-- waste.

00:34:51.830 --> 00:34:56.570
waste-- why is waste always to
work in every single company?

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.650
Waste is money that you are
throwing to the garbage.

00:34:59.650 --> 00:35:01.730
So whenever you
can go to extract

00:35:01.730 --> 00:35:04.740
value of that waste--
always going to work.

00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.530
So this is kind of
a natural connection

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:08.280
with any environmental
initiative

00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.250
you find in the planet.

00:35:09.250 --> 00:35:10.541
Doesn't matter which one it is.

00:35:10.541 --> 00:35:13.115
Even if your company
does like zero interest

00:35:13.115 --> 00:35:16.490
in the environment, waste always
connects with the environment--

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:17.310
always.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.990
So that's always a
natural-- you see

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:21.195
that highlighted in your
reports of your companies--

00:35:21.195 --> 00:35:25.980
you know, zero waste plants,
zero waste to landfill.

00:35:25.980 --> 00:35:27.990
Waste is always
one of those areas.

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:31.270
And that's just because
that connects to operations

00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:32.720
very directly.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:37.157
That also is usually not
measured the first time around.

00:35:37.157 --> 00:35:38.490
The company has not measured it.

00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.000
And you start
measuring and people

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.050
can relate to dimensions
because they work with materials

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:42.800
every single day.

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:45.910
And you can put targets
that are very aggressive.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:48.470
And you can also put a vision
that everyone understands--

00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:50.890
that is, zero waste.

00:35:50.890 --> 00:35:55.102
So if you see of any company
that is doing tangentially

00:35:55.102 --> 00:35:56.560
trying to get this
started, you see

00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.630
some sort of waste initiative.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:35:59.180
Again, why?

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:04.810
Because any plant manager, any
distribution center manager,

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:08.820
anyone that manages anything
that is physical waste,

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.190
you can also relate it to.

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:13.410
That's always a good way
for companies to start.

00:36:13.410 --> 00:36:14.550
The problem is
it's not connected

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:15.925
to the whole
strategy, but that's

00:36:15.925 --> 00:36:17.950
always another thing
you find that I think

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.800
is very easy to
measure, which gives me

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:24.815
to the other one that is next
to it on outbound packaging.

00:36:24.815 --> 00:36:27.004
Packaging is another
way of waste.

00:36:27.004 --> 00:36:29.170
It's waste that happens
once you ship your products.

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:30.461
It's visible to your customers.

00:36:30.461 --> 00:36:32.990
That's an easy way to start.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.330
Transportation impacts
also on the bottom line.

00:36:35.330 --> 00:36:36.730
I'm looking at those.

00:36:36.730 --> 00:36:38.920
Those our people see
less miles traveled.

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:40.170
That's less cost.

00:36:40.170 --> 00:36:42.740
Less fuel consumption--
that's less fuel.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.560
That's also less cost.

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.100
Bury, resell your
[INAUDIBLE] that's

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:48.560
less distance, which is
less cost and also emission.

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:51.010
So you see that
those ones over there

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:54.760
are the ones that connect
easily with your business

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:58.860
but not necessarily connect
easily with your strategy.

00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:04.490
That's why companies have that
always because people grasp it.

00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.600
But that doesn't mean according
to the whole framework,

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.849
those are the issues
to put emphasis on.

00:37:11.849 --> 00:37:14.140
The fact that you can do them
doesn't mean you have to.

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:14.640
Go ahead.

00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.930
STUDENT: Here.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:21.790
I have a question.

00:37:21.790 --> 00:37:22.415
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:37:22.415 --> 00:37:24.970
STUDENT: It's how to
determine the boundaries

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:26.810
of your responsibility
as a company.

00:37:26.810 --> 00:37:29.310
Because especially when
you manage a supply chain,

00:37:29.310 --> 00:37:32.230
there are a lot of
levels of vendors.

00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:34.240
There are a lot of
suppliers that at the end,

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:35.770
you don't know
who's supplying you

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:40.622
and you don't know if they
are compliant with those,

00:37:40.622 --> 00:37:42.330
whether it's [INAUDIBLE]
for the company.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.990
So how to determine
those boundaries

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:47.340
of the responsibility
of the company.

00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:49.380
PROFESSOR: So let's
talk about that.

00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:50.840
Someone has a thought.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.640
How do you determine
your boundaries?

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.440
STUDENT: Well, we're
doing auto companies

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:58.000
and Ford is taking care of this.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.240
So they draw the boundary
at their tier one suppliers.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.550
And they say, we want all
of our tier one suppliers

00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:10.890
to comply with the ISO
14001 standards for shipping

00:38:10.890 --> 00:38:11.850
emissions.

00:38:11.850 --> 00:38:15.190
And then they've sort of
thrown-- not really thrown

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:16.670
out the level two
and level three,

00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:20.720
but they're doing studies with
the level three and saying,

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.770
we're seeing if we can figure
out what our level three

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:26.760
it suppliers are doing.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.240
But it's not really the focus.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.250
The focus is the tier one.

00:38:30.250 --> 00:38:32.890
They provide training
to the tier one

00:38:32.890 --> 00:38:34.767
on their environmental
management system.

00:38:34.767 --> 00:38:36.600
So they're actively
involved in the tier one

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:40.805
and sort of peripherally
involved in anyone beyond that.

00:38:40.805 --> 00:38:42.430
PROFESSOR: So let's
[? pick a little ?]

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.800
on Ford and the auto companies.

00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.500
So based on what you have read
on Ford, what do you think

00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:50.545
is their strategic
imperative for sustainability

00:38:50.545 --> 00:38:52.202
and environment?

00:38:52.202 --> 00:38:55.590
STUDENT: Well,
they hit it as far

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:58.360
as marketing for their vehicles.

00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.720
And then besides
that-- so it seems

00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:07.210
like they're getting heavily
driven by the Carbon Disclosure

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:07.710
Project.

00:39:07.710 --> 00:39:10.690
Because pretty much everything
that is on their sustainability

00:39:10.690 --> 00:39:13.070
website is almost
a copy and paste

00:39:13.070 --> 00:39:15.320
from what they put into the
Carbon Disclosure Project.

00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:19.100
So I think they've been
getting some external pressures

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:19.790
recently.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:22.690
And as far as their
corporate strategy

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:27.120
goes with stuff that's not
being marketed to the customer,

00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.069
they're sort of
convincing investors

00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:31.860
that they're starting
to do the right thing

00:39:31.860 --> 00:39:34.740
and being a good
corporate citizen

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.410
and starting to incorporate
environmental stuff

00:39:37.410 --> 00:39:39.990
in their strategic CSR.

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:43.050
But it's hard to determine.

00:39:43.050 --> 00:39:44.590
It's kind of hard
to figure them out

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:47.910
because they really
only give you

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:53.330
the politicians' line of, we're
doing this because it's good

00:39:53.330 --> 00:39:57.020
and we're looking, like, all the
way down to conflict minerals

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:58.470
for our sources.

00:39:58.470 --> 00:40:01.870
PROFESSOR: So from your
point of view, then,

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.300
should they spend
more time-- I'll

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.674
get back to you,
to the question.

00:40:04.674 --> 00:40:07.672
But should they spend
more time looking at

00:40:07.672 --> 00:40:08.630
their suppliers or not?

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:11.373
I mean, I know you're
not the Ford CEO, but--

00:40:11.373 --> 00:40:14.190
STUDENT: I mean, for a company
that's as large as them,

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:16.650
I think it would be extremely
difficult and very cost

00:40:16.650 --> 00:40:19.930
intensive for them because
they have tens of thousands

00:40:19.930 --> 00:40:20.600
of suppliers.

00:40:20.600 --> 00:40:23.782
And trying to track down
every single one, I think,

00:40:23.782 --> 00:40:25.060
would be insane.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.740
But they have a few level
ones and they are directly

00:40:29.740 --> 00:40:30.790
involved with those.

00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:34.840
And then the amount of
suppliers exponentially

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:37.720
grows when you leave tier one.

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:39.400
Like, as soon as
you get to tier two,

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.132
it goes up by order
of magnitude and then

00:40:41.132 --> 00:40:42.715
another order of
magnitude after that.

00:40:42.715 --> 00:40:47.000
And they think they have
10 tiers of suppliers.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.140
So to track down everyone
down to level 10 I think

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:52.410
is impossible.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.840
PROFESSOR: So I'll ask
[INAUDIBLE] of questions

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:58.570
if you remember [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:03.155
What was the life cycle impact
of a car in use versus--

00:41:03.155 --> 00:41:03.780
do yo remember?

00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:07.690
It was like 60% or 70%.

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:11.840
70% of the emissions of
the life cycle of a car

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:16.080
happens during use, which
means the number one

00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:20.360
issue of your car company
should be fuel use.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.080
Design better vehicles-- that
should be all your energy.

00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:25.210
The rest is important.

00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:29.715
Those 30% is important but
is not critical to achieving,

00:41:29.715 --> 00:41:32.980
let's say, significant
impact over time.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:35.150
So this is one way to
answer your question

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:36.250
and this is two ways.

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:39.050
One is where these
companies are trying

00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:41.683
to put most of their effort
is in designing products

00:41:41.683 --> 00:41:43.779
that are more efficient.

00:41:43.779 --> 00:41:44.820
That's where they should.

00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.620
I'm not saying they're doing.

00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:46.760
That's what they should be.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:48.940
Because you can
achieve both things.

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:51.645
You could achieve a better
sales, better market,

00:41:51.645 --> 00:41:53.270
but also that's where
your impacts are.

00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:56.180
I mean, if you really care
about the environment as Ford,

00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.450
you should pretty much
say, you know what?

00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:59.920
My number one
priority in the world

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:01.330
is to make the most
efficient cars.

00:42:01.330 --> 00:42:02.500
We [? say you ?]
sometimes do [INAUDIBLE] I

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.770
think they have this--
you showed it last time.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:07.440
They have all this zero
efficiency car or energy,

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:10.170
yep-- zero emissions car.

00:42:10.170 --> 00:42:12.150
And that's where
they are aiming for.

00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:14.575
And this immediately
answers how deep

00:42:14.575 --> 00:42:18.350
you should work in
your supply chain.

00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:21.502
Because if that's not
your number one place,

00:42:21.502 --> 00:42:23.210
you should definitely
do the right thing.

00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.880
What is the minimum
thing you should do?

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:28.480
You should mitigate risk
in your supply chain,

00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:30.850
kind of comply on the things
that people are asking.

00:42:30.850 --> 00:42:33.510
And that's why you probably will
see that they will go straight

00:42:33.510 --> 00:42:35.400
to the minimum
number of questions

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.295
that the CDP report
asks them to do.

00:42:37.295 --> 00:42:38.920
Because you want to
do the right thing.

00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:40.000
I mean, sure-- you're
going to save money.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.362
It's good for you as a company.

00:42:41.362 --> 00:42:42.570
It resonates with your brand.

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:46.050
You cannot sell a brand that is
zero emissions if in your whole

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:47.610
factory you have
a bunch of waste.

00:42:47.610 --> 00:42:50.490
And also this is related
to cost reductions maybe.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.140
So all these things
kind of immediately

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:55.260
tells you my focus
is the product that's

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:56.530
where the impacts are.

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:00.300
Maybe what I should focus in
my supply chain are things that

00:43:00.300 --> 00:43:03.510
have direct impact, put
my resources there--

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:08.100
some resources, and but try to
cover all the network of OEMs

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:11.770
that supply my car.

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:15.130
So this is kind of a--
I'm kind of backtracking

00:43:15.130 --> 00:43:18.150
on the question, but
the answer is not

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.730
tied to how big you should go.

00:43:19.730 --> 00:43:21.920
It's where your
impacts are or whatever

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:23.110
is the main purpose you do.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:26.040
If your impacts are
in the use phase,

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.969
then maybe you should
not spend that much time.

00:43:29.969 --> 00:43:31.510
I mean, do not ignore
your suppliers.

00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:32.382
Make them better.

00:43:32.382 --> 00:43:34.715
But it's not where you should
try to go all the way down

00:43:34.715 --> 00:43:38.250
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] They
might have design principles

00:43:38.250 --> 00:43:40.600
that they can help make
the car use less gas

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:45.350
or less-- be lighter
and drive farther.

00:43:45.350 --> 00:43:47.780
But in the case of, like,
the Booth's shampoo,

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.010
Booth's is a pharmacy
chain in Europe

00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:52.785
and they found out
when they looked

00:43:52.785 --> 00:43:55.240
through life cycles [INAUDIBLE]
shampoo that the largest

00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.610
impact is in the use.

00:43:56.610 --> 00:43:59.440
And so they decided they
want to do consumer campaigns

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.280
about taking shorter
showers, using less heat,

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.430
and obviously changing consumer
behavior around your shower.

00:44:06.430 --> 00:44:08.380
It's not a very easy to change.

00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:11.780
So I think they thus since
dropped that kind of campaign,

00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:13.250
realizing that they
can only affect

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:16.120
their own internal operations
and some of their suppliers

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.440
as opposed to the
downstream impacts.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:19.440
PROFESSOR: So yeah.

00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.490
So there was a couple comments
and then I'll keep talking.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:23.531
STUDENT: --going to say
is a point of comparison.

00:44:23.531 --> 00:44:27.850
I'm [INAUDIBLE] BMW and
most of the marketing

00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:31.050
material on their own website
and others [INAUDIBLE] BMW,

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:34.500
it's all about the
cars [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:36.557
or the technology that
they're developing to make

00:44:36.557 --> 00:44:37.640
their cars more efficient.

00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.020
A lot of that's driven by just
German engineering but also

00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:46.215
a lot of legislation that
is taking effect in Europe.

00:44:46.215 --> 00:44:47.715
But another thing
that's interesting

00:44:47.715 --> 00:44:51.400
is they have an electric
car sharing program

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.580
that they started up in
Europe and now in the US.

00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:57.010
And so they're
really drilling it

00:44:57.010 --> 00:45:01.167
on the use phase, which is
where they have the most impact.

00:45:01.167 --> 00:45:02.625
So they're doing
a pretty good job.

00:45:02.625 --> 00:45:04.410
PROFESSOR: And also
I think I do not want

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.830
to underestimate your insight.

00:45:05.830 --> 00:45:08.960
That is, these supply chains
are massive, you know?

00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.560
The car supply chain is
just incredibly complex.

00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.150
They have no idea really
where these things are.

00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:17.260
And they have really
very little resources

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:21.280
to try to spend time on
going after that information.

00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:23.130
So they are hoping
that by putting

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:26.920
some pressure in tier one, this
will propagate down somehow.

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:31.100
And I think they-- the
list of priorities they're

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.750
doing I think is the right.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.920
Tier one is probably
how far they should go.

00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:39.100
Now, let's look at
another company.

00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:39.810
Who else is--

00:45:39.810 --> 00:45:45.665
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] so
I know in many industries

00:45:45.665 --> 00:45:51.265
this is not even close,
but what if the place where

00:45:51.265 --> 00:45:54.180
you can help where
there's more of an impact,

00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:59.330
you're already very close to
being as efficient as possible?

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:03.860
So I mean, I'm assuming
that [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:05.060
this is not the case.

00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:08.250
But in super efficient,
putting more resources

00:46:08.250 --> 00:46:13.620
into that type of research would
yield much less results than,

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:15.940
for example, trying to work
with your supply chain.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:19.430
So how do you even
determine where

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:23.344
you're reaching a limit
of what your levels are?

00:46:23.344 --> 00:46:24.760
STUDENT: Well, my
take on it would

00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:27.500
be most companies have an
area that they can address.

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:31.489
And so they might say
their most controlled

00:46:31.489 --> 00:46:33.780
might be their logistics
system or their transportation

00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:34.120
network.

00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.530
And they can say they've
already optimized that.

00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:36.905
There's nothing
else they can do.

00:46:36.905 --> 00:46:38.990
But there's usually--
there's no company that

00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:41.150
can't go to the
next level hotspot

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:43.880
that they can start addressing.

00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.770
Some companies
we've talked to have

00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:48.270
done what they call a
materiality assessment where

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:51.060
they look at things that
are material to the business

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:54.140
and then they assess the
impacts on each of those given

00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:59.100
their products or their
operations or their employee

00:46:59.100 --> 00:46:59.600
engagement.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:04.080
And they pick all these spots
and they can kind of-- they

00:47:04.080 --> 00:47:07.860
can kind of rank how they
address each of those, trying

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.740
to address the hotspots
of their products

00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:12.198
or their own internal operations
and then maybe [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:12.198 --> 00:47:13.975
down that materiality
assessment on how

00:47:13.975 --> 00:47:17.010
they address those impacts.

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:21.065
I don't know if any-- has anyone
seen a a materiality assessment

00:47:21.065 --> 00:47:22.320
as they come through?

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:23.200
Nothing out there?

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.010
OK, interesting.

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:27.280
PROFESSOR: So I want to hear
from another of the case

00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:28.550
studies you're
working on in terms

00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:30.341
of how did you go to
into your supply chain

00:47:30.341 --> 00:47:33.186
or have you observed in the
companies you're working with.

00:47:36.930 --> 00:47:38.791
Roberto?

00:47:38.791 --> 00:47:40.290
STUDENT: I was
working because we're

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:42.936
doing Chevron and Exxon/Mobile.

00:47:42.936 --> 00:47:44.810
PROFESSOR: So your
splicing is kind of short.

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:45.516
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:47:45.516 --> 00:47:47.182
And it's pretty obscure.

00:47:47.182 --> 00:47:53.622
So one area we can look at
is shipping, ocean shipping,

00:47:53.622 --> 00:47:56.574
of crude oil from one
location to another.

00:47:56.574 --> 00:47:59.034
Which, of course, there's
a lot of impact on that.

00:47:59.034 --> 00:48:04.960
But aside from that, everything
else is just within the plan.

00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:08.420
STUDENT: I'm doing Toyota
alongside of BMW [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:12.675
And they have the halo effect
of their previous five billion,

00:48:12.675 --> 00:48:14.430
how many cars have they sold.

00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:17.300
Yet they get hammered with--
the CDP scores are pretty low.

00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:22.690
And I think that actually having
a car that is so successful,

00:48:22.690 --> 00:48:27.160
an image, reputation that is
good in that market actually

00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.770
keeps them from doing better.

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.830
And as a result, they
fall behind companies

00:48:30.830 --> 00:48:34.290
that have cars that typically
are a lot more gas guzzling.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:39.190
So I think you can have an
issue where a reputation

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:42.030
gain somewhere actually
prevents you from going further

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:45.180
in other areas.

00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.380
PROFESSOR: I want to
hear from somebody else.

00:48:47.380 --> 00:48:48.334
Which-- yep.

00:48:48.334 --> 00:48:50.660
STUDENT: We're
Nestle and Hershey's.

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:52.510
I presented this a
little while ago,

00:48:52.510 --> 00:48:58.300
but Nestle has a couple of
supplier tiers [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:58.300 --> 00:49:02.349
to [INAUDIBLE] and today
require their tier one--

00:49:02.349 --> 00:49:04.890
like, their direct suppliers--
to comply with their suppliers

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:07.250
code-- just in and of
itself a little vague.

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:09.496
But then the vast majority
of their suppliers,

00:49:09.496 --> 00:49:11.162
like, for their
commodities, they really

00:49:11.162 --> 00:49:13.972
have no control or
traceability over where

00:49:13.972 --> 00:49:15.609
those products are coming from.

00:49:15.609 --> 00:49:17.900
PROFESSOR: So let's talk
about-- that's a great example

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:21.820
and I'm glad you
brought up food.

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:25.100
And let's talk about
food in many ways.

00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:28.160
So I just-- so I
just-- full disclosure.

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.510
So Starbucks is a
partner of our center,

00:49:30.510 --> 00:49:34.600
which a partner means they
give us money for research.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.480
But this is part
of the work we've

00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:38.380
done before going to
research with them.

00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:41.370
But I'll talk about Starbucks.

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:44.700
The same with Unilever,
same with Nestle.

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.640
And they have actually
the imperative

00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:50.160
of trying to go as deep as
possible in their supply chain

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.402
as they can.

00:49:51.402 --> 00:49:53.080
And let me explain
a little bit why.

00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:58.480
So let's talk about
Starbucks, right?

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:08.190
So Starbucks coffee-- this is
supply chain that is very much

00:50:08.190 --> 00:50:13.230
goes to fragmented on sourcing
side-- lots of small farmers.

00:50:13.230 --> 00:50:15.807
Similar like Palm Oil, similar--
many of those are like this.

00:50:15.807 --> 00:50:16.890
Bananas are not like this.

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:19.390
But there's a few
big manufacturers.

00:50:19.390 --> 00:50:22.820
[INAUDIBLE] this one is
small parcel manufacturers.

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:29.180
And Starbucks, a little bit on
the way they see their business

00:50:29.180 --> 00:50:31.930
is that we are
providing our customers

00:50:31.930 --> 00:50:34.390
with like a third
home and third place.

00:50:34.390 --> 00:50:36.450
They have some sort of
wording along those lines.

00:50:36.450 --> 00:50:38.860
And coffee for us
is an experience,

00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.040
an experience that we want
to transmit to our customers.

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:45.710
And that experience cannot be
complete unless we can tell

00:50:45.710 --> 00:50:50.121
our customers that our product
is the best product ever,

00:50:50.121 --> 00:50:50.620
right?

00:50:50.620 --> 00:50:53.590
And the best product ever,
from their point of view,

00:50:53.590 --> 00:50:54.760
has multiple dimensions.

00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.182
It's, of course, quality,
right, the product, number one.

00:50:57.182 --> 00:50:58.640
Safety-- you don't
want to get ill.

00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.037
And you have a
place that is nice

00:51:00.037 --> 00:51:02.620
where you can enjoy your coffee
and have friends and so forth.

00:51:02.620 --> 00:51:05.097
But the other dimension they
are completely conscious about

00:51:05.097 --> 00:51:09.110
is we need to make sure
that you are paying premium

00:51:09.110 --> 00:51:11.460
for this experience and
we want to make sure

00:51:11.460 --> 00:51:18.271
that we make our suppliers as
prosperous as possible for two

00:51:18.271 --> 00:51:18.770
reasons.

00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:20.270
One, because it's
the image we sell,

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:22.780
but the other one is that if
we do not make them prosperous,

00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:26.540
we're not going to have the
best quality coffee ever.

00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:29.910
Because if you take corners and
you don't wash your beans well

00:51:29.910 --> 00:51:34.000
and you do not plan the
best coffee in the world

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.499
and you move to another
plantation and you-- then

00:51:36.499 --> 00:51:38.165
you lose the best
coffee in the company.

00:51:38.165 --> 00:51:41.440
I mean, it's somehow
embedded to you.

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:43.700
Unilever has a similar
view of the world

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:48.620
is-- we sell fish sticks.
[INAUDIBLE] it's no fish,

00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.370
no fish sticks.

00:51:50.370 --> 00:51:53.402
I sell fish sticks
for you to eat.

00:51:53.402 --> 00:51:55.360
But if there's no fish,
there's no fish sticks.

00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:59.610
So I have to care about how
people catch the fish-- maybe

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.730
not in the short term,
but in the long term.

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:05.640
So this immediately makes you
be much more aware on not only

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:09.320
the whole seller that you buy
your products from, but rather

00:52:09.320 --> 00:52:11.500
try to go as deep as possible.

00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:15.790
So in their cases, both
Starbucks, Unilever, Nestle

00:52:15.790 --> 00:52:17.860
are trying to do the
best we can on some

00:52:17.860 --> 00:52:22.080
of their key commodities to
try to go as deep as possible.

00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:25.320
Now, Starbucks, because their
ethos was a little bit more

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:28.412
on the sustainability
aspect, on the shared value

00:52:28.412 --> 00:52:30.620
aspect of your supply chains
from the very beginning,

00:52:30.620 --> 00:52:35.900
they actually have much
better progress on that area.

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:38.470
So they instituted
the CAFE Practices.

00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:40.648
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
CAFE Practices

00:52:40.648 --> 00:52:44.920
where they have actually a
supply chain certification

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:47.830
group that goes into the
farmers and actually certifies

00:52:47.830 --> 00:52:51.750
that the farmers are trying to
use less pesticides if they're

00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:55.130
organic and using less
water, making sure they're

00:52:55.130 --> 00:52:57.302
paid above minimum wage.

00:52:57.302 --> 00:52:58.760
And then Starbucks
Social has a lot

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.051
of different training programs.

00:53:00.051 --> 00:53:04.240
Because one of their
greatest problems is farming

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:07.050
is becoming less of a desirable
occupation around the world.

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:09.060
That's not just a coffee
problem but a chocolate

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.640
problem and a tea problem.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:15.500
And so kind of ensuring
that the farmers have

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:18.681
good quality of life so that
they continued to grow coffee

00:53:18.681 --> 00:53:20.680
and they have a sustainable
source of the coffee

00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.596
that they're sourcing.

00:53:21.596 --> 00:53:23.610
So they have auditors
that go around the world

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:25.510
and they work with
farmers when they

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:28.970
have a gap that they're able
to improve their practices

00:53:28.970 --> 00:53:29.640
in that area.

00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:32.040
So they started up the
program, I forget, in 2008.

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:37.550
And they said they're going
to get to 95% 25 2015.

00:53:37.550 --> 00:53:39.312
And so they're
about 93% of the way

00:53:39.312 --> 00:53:41.870
that all these farmers are
certified around the world.

00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:43.120
They're a third party auditor.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:47.257
So it's not Starbucks going out
to these farms in Costa Rica

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:48.090
and certifying them.

00:53:48.090 --> 00:53:50.050
So then you have
third party auditors

00:53:50.050 --> 00:53:53.690
that they then report to
Starbucks who kind of has

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:55.970
the overall deal with them.

00:53:55.970 --> 00:53:58.420
PROFESSOR: So they
have a database

00:53:58.420 --> 00:54:01.120
with all their suppliers that
[? our ?] CAFE already did,

00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:01.620
right?

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.670
This database is pubic.

00:54:02.670 --> 00:54:05.240
Actually, in theory, you can
go into the CAFE Practices

00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:05.740
website.

00:54:05.740 --> 00:54:06.906
STUDENT: You can request it.

00:54:06.906 --> 00:54:08.200
PROFESSOR: You can request it.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:10.880
It's not public published but
it's public of view requested.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.505
They may say no, but
you can ask again.

00:54:12.505 --> 00:54:16.690
And maybe eventually, they
give you some information.

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:19.250
So they have gone deep, deep,
deep in your supply chain--

00:54:19.250 --> 00:54:22.490
as deep as they can do with
the resources they have.

00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:24.250
And the resources
Alexi was outlining

00:54:24.250 --> 00:54:25.950
is we set up the practices.

00:54:25.950 --> 00:54:28.990
We ask our buyers of
coffee that unless you

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:30.680
are willing to pay
a little bit more

00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.580
for coffee that is CAFE
certified so you have

00:54:32.580 --> 00:54:35.440
the incentive and you're going
to eventually make this happen.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.540
We do not force our
suppliers to sell to us.

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.030
They can sell to other people.

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:41.880
So the CAFE practices are not
only for Starbucks suppliers.

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.712
Same with Unilever
and the Palm Oil.

00:54:43.712 --> 00:54:45.920
I guess you went through
all the Palm Oil discussions

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:47.130
so I will not repeat it.

00:54:47.130 --> 00:54:52.330
But Unilever is now trying
to go directly to Palm Oil.

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:54.290
Straight-- no commodity pricing.

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:58.290
Let's avoid that, let's say,
that lack of transparency.

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:01.460
Because it's so important
to us that we'd rather

00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:03.110
pay a little bit
more because this

00:55:03.110 --> 00:55:05.290
is what We need to care about.

00:55:05.290 --> 00:55:06.840
So it's a little
bit of how deep.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.256
In this case, it
went really deep.

00:55:08.256 --> 00:55:10.180
Because this is--
food supply chains,

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:13.720
especially agricultural ones,
are very critical for them

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:14.734
as a business.

00:55:14.734 --> 00:55:16.400
So this would be a
sense of how deep you

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.920
go is a function of
where you are impacts are

00:55:18.920 --> 00:55:21.150
and where your interests
are and your risks are

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:23.610
as well as a company.

00:55:23.610 --> 00:55:25.544
Anything else on that question?

00:55:25.544 --> 00:55:26.710
That's a very important one.

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:30.243
Any other of your companies
that you-- is either different?

00:55:30.243 --> 00:55:31.149
No?

00:55:31.149 --> 00:55:32.950
All right, good.

00:55:32.950 --> 00:55:37.830
So let me then get you
back to a couple of slides

00:55:37.830 --> 00:55:41.070
that we set up at the beginning.

00:55:41.070 --> 00:55:51.780
And I will try to
give you-- this

00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:54.280
was the first slide that
when we started the course,

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:55.980
we kind of went through it.

00:55:55.980 --> 00:56:04.220
So [INAUDIBLE] All
right, so these

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.980
were the way we
structured the course.

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.630
Let me kind of try to explain
why we did that work now

00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.947
that you have a better sense
of what the strategy is.

00:56:11.947 --> 00:56:14.280
The strategy is actually to
say no to many of the things

00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.400
that we have here.

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.690
That's what a company should do.

00:56:17.690 --> 00:56:21.190
One is to understand that just
because of the nature of how

00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:24.380
businesses have
been developed, you

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:26.980
have to somehow
take this life cycle

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:28.499
view of your
product, which means

00:56:28.499 --> 00:56:30.290
you have to not only
think about the things

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:31.664
you control and
buy from, and you

00:56:31.664 --> 00:56:34.810
have to somehow make sure
you keep in your radar

00:56:34.810 --> 00:56:37.410
how you use and
recover your products.

00:56:37.410 --> 00:56:39.160
Let me give you an
interesting example

00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:44.990
today which goes back to how
companies do their businesses.

00:56:44.990 --> 00:56:47.020
Do know what the
espresso-- the company that

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.977
does these automated things?

00:56:48.977 --> 00:56:51.060
So we have a friend of
mine from the Netherlands--

00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:52.560
and also I have an
espresso machine.

00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:54.420
He has an espresso
machine as well.

00:56:54.420 --> 00:56:55.470
Pretty crazy-- we're
talking about this.

00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:56.415
Oh, [INAUDIBLE] great.

00:56:56.415 --> 00:56:59.152
So are you part of
their recycling program?

00:56:59.152 --> 00:57:00.526
Espresso has a
recycling program?

00:57:00.526 --> 00:57:02.050
Yeah, they have one.

00:57:02.050 --> 00:57:03.830
It's very important to Europe.

00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:06.170
When you get all your
packages, you get like a bag.

00:57:06.170 --> 00:57:09.060
And you put your used bags
and they recycle it for you.

00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:11.350
Because these
instant-- the packages

00:57:11.350 --> 00:57:15.040
of coffee that you
process your machine

00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.070
are designed to be high quality.

00:57:17.070 --> 00:57:19.380
But they cannot be processed
in the US for recycling.

00:57:19.380 --> 00:57:21.465
So they're waste and
they're lots of waste

00:57:21.465 --> 00:57:22.340
and in Europe either.

00:57:22.340 --> 00:57:24.670
So basically, they
have the whole program

00:57:24.670 --> 00:57:28.740
for espresso customers is
highly advertised in Europe

00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:30.240
on the closed loop.

00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:33.940
And here in the US,
is there somewhere

00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:37.330
in the website that
is not the core thing?

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:40.710
And now they have-- just to
tell you that even this view,

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:44.710
you have to have a
market that cares, right?

00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:47.374
So even if you think of
the best process in the US,

00:57:47.374 --> 00:57:49.040
people maybe don't
care about recycling.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:50.050
So it's too expensive.

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.200
We know how hard it is
to set up those systems.

00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:54.970
So in Europe, that's
much more developed.

00:57:54.970 --> 00:57:56.850
Anyway, so the first
business to understand

00:57:56.850 --> 00:58:00.084
that you have to decide in
this system is not easy.

00:58:00.084 --> 00:58:01.250
And we know that's not easy.

00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:05.366
And you're required to either
partner with a third party

00:58:05.366 --> 00:58:06.740
and you have the
scale like we're

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:09.349
talking in [INAUDIBLE] and the
connection with the customer.

00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:11.890
You may be able to do this by
yourself, but most of the time,

00:58:11.890 --> 00:58:14.050
you'll probably
have to do, leverage

00:58:14.050 --> 00:58:16.610
a separate supply chain may
be expensive at the beginning.

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:18.310
But over time, it
will get better.

00:58:18.310 --> 00:58:19.706
But if you need
to own this, this

00:58:19.706 --> 00:58:21.080
is going to be a
little bit hard.

00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.780
So that's understanding a little
bit of the challenges of these

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.060
because this is very
less studied in general

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:28.910
in most companies--
was one of our goals.

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:31.990
Started using the life
cycle view of the world.

00:58:31.990 --> 00:58:33.980
Then we really went
into understanding

00:58:33.980 --> 00:58:37.860
how to make the measurements
of, at least in some degree, how

00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:41.630
a measurement is done
on the use of resources,

00:58:41.630 --> 00:58:43.191
the life cycle assessment.

00:58:43.191 --> 00:58:43.690
Why?

00:58:43.690 --> 00:58:45.310
Because measurement
is the only way

00:58:45.310 --> 00:58:49.890
you can eventually make
decisions at some point.

00:58:49.890 --> 00:58:53.467
Doesn't matter how
committed you are.

00:58:53.467 --> 00:58:55.300
At some point, you have
to make a trade off.

00:58:55.300 --> 00:58:57.420
Should I do this or do that?

00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:02.830
I love the talk from
Seventh Generation.

00:59:02.830 --> 00:59:04.130
I thought it was great.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:07.780
Should you should
use these bags that

00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:10.750
are worse off for
the environment,

00:59:10.750 --> 00:59:14.800
or should we use our laundry
detergent containers?

00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.740
That's a really
concrete decision

00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:18.950
you do every single day.

00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:22.580
If you have no measurement, you
cannot make the decision well.

00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:24.190
They know that
what they're doing

00:59:24.190 --> 00:59:28.740
is worse for the environment
on an individual unit basis.

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:31.020
But they also know that
if they don't offer that,

00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:32.980
they will not be in the shelf.

00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:36.470
So as a whole, it's better
to be bad on one product

00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:37.980
but better as a business.

00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:40.160
And that decision
can only be made

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:42.262
if you have the information.

00:59:42.262 --> 00:59:43.970
Otherwise, you will
never be able to make

00:59:43.970 --> 00:59:47.610
the decisions bad or
good or conscious or not.

00:59:47.610 --> 00:59:50.000
That's why life cycle
assessment, understanding life

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.290
cycle analysis,
and try to bring it

00:59:52.290 --> 00:59:57.895
as close as possible to product
design is very important.

00:59:57.895 --> 00:59:59.520
That's what we
including in this class.

00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.061
Even though it's a
supply chain class

01:00:01.061 --> 01:00:03.850
and this is a whole course
on life cycle assessment,

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.780
you need to understand that to
be able to make real product

01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:08.990
decisions and real
supply chain decisions,

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:13.710
you have to somehow get into
grabbing this information.

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.920
This is what Nike did very well.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.200
After the whole process
and labor and they

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:22.600
embraced sustainability,
they created

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:25.390
a Nike considered index
for their products

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:28.100
and they did life cycle
analysis of materials.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.290
And they tried to
inform their decisions

01:00:30.290 --> 01:00:32.710
as best as possible--
measurements

01:00:32.710 --> 01:00:35.150
so people can make the decisions
of the moment of making

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:37.250
that trade off.

01:00:37.250 --> 01:00:41.350
That was the idea of getting
carbon life cycles thinking

01:00:41.350 --> 01:00:43.550
into the course.

01:00:43.550 --> 01:00:47.510
And the other [? rest ?] of the
course was a little bit more

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:51.120
focused on the other
stakeholders that

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:58.510
push you one way or the other
to make the moral case, make

01:00:58.510 --> 01:01:02.009
the reputational case through
a tax or partnership, right?

01:01:02.009 --> 01:01:04.050
These are the stakeholders
that actually push you

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:08.240
a lot towards this thinking.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.164
This is stakeholders.

01:01:10.164 --> 01:01:11.330
You need to understand them.

01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:14.490
You need to somehow understand
them and engage them

01:01:14.490 --> 01:01:18.990
but engage them not to agree
with them on those cases,

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:21.910
but to try to use them
to inform eventually

01:01:21.910 --> 01:01:23.280
how to make those products.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:25.320
This is why you need
to really understand

01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.800
where policy is going.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.580
We saw the policy talk.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:31.540
Policy unfortunately
is going nowhere.

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.340
This is not going to
be a policy discussion.

01:01:34.340 --> 01:01:36.320
We know that policy
is very convoluted.

01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:37.790
It's going to be lagging always.

01:01:37.790 --> 01:01:39.956
So as a company, if you
really want to be strategic,

01:01:39.956 --> 01:01:42.170
you need to be more about
either understanding

01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:46.682
where the interests
are of your customers,

01:01:46.682 --> 01:01:48.390
where you can find
competitive advantage,

01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:50.860
where you can tie that to cost
savings, something like that.

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.110
But if you post, it's going
to move very, very slowly.

01:01:53.110 --> 01:01:55.370
You can drive policy a
little bit further ahead,

01:01:55.370 --> 01:01:58.240
but you saw the
process of Mercury.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.540
And that's the easy one.

01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:04.554
The CO2 greenhouse gas policy
discussion is stalled forever

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:05.970
and it will take
many, many years.

01:02:05.970 --> 01:02:07.970
That's not a reason not
to do anything about it,

01:02:07.970 --> 01:02:09.440
but you have to
be very much aware

01:02:09.440 --> 01:02:13.340
that really effective
policymaking is not

01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:16.680
in the foreseeable future unless
there's some big disaster.

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.130
If something terrible
happens and lots of people

01:02:19.130 --> 01:02:22.720
die for something that can be
connected with climate change,

01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:23.220
trust me.

01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.210
Next day, you have regulation.

01:02:25.210 --> 01:02:26.920
But right now, the
way things are moving,

01:02:26.920 --> 01:02:28.900
you saw the mercury processes.

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.176
How many [INAUDIBLE] in total?

01:02:30.176 --> 01:02:30.676
12?

01:02:30.676 --> 01:02:31.700
14?

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:35.350
From the science consensus
to getting all the things--

01:02:35.350 --> 01:02:38.730
and you saw that all this
is just really compromises.

01:02:38.730 --> 01:02:41.333
It's never going to give you
to taking specific action.

01:02:41.333 --> 01:02:43.690
So you have to be
very aware of that.

01:02:43.690 --> 01:02:47.050
And you saw the view of
the NGOs which, of course,

01:02:47.050 --> 01:02:50.380
they are really committed
usually to the moral argument.

01:02:50.380 --> 01:02:52.419
That's their main driving force.

01:02:52.419 --> 01:02:53.960
They believe this
is the right thing.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.950
They are the
conscience of humanity

01:02:56.950 --> 01:03:00.630
and they want to move companies
to do the moral thing.

01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:02.690
And companies need
to push all the time.

01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:05.160
I want to do the moral
thing, but that's not

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.970
where my strengths are.

01:03:06.970 --> 01:03:09.200
The best way is to try to
do something in between.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:10.880
OK, good, so we've
[INAUDIBLE] us

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:14.240
to how to make this
happen in a company.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.060
So this is the talk I give
to executives when they ask

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:19.760
me, oh, so give me a process.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.439
People like, like, five step
process or three checklist

01:03:22.439 --> 01:03:22.980
or something.

01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:24.980
But ultimately, it's
something like this, right?

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:26.650
It's what we were
talking earlier.

01:03:26.650 --> 01:03:31.520
It's that you have to understand
the pressures of your business

01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.540
which we have talked
to ad nauseam.

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:36.420
And you have to make
this decision that

01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:41.280
is, say no to some
things and don't go them.

01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:43.205
Somehow, do not do them.

01:03:43.205 --> 01:03:47.500
And not do them means do the
minimum, do the right thing,

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.860
or do the things [? where ?]
to mitigate your risk

01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.200
and pick a few that you
really want to do well.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:54.470
And that's a kind of--
and to do that property,

01:03:54.470 --> 01:03:57.280
you have to measure somehow.

01:03:57.280 --> 01:03:59.560
And once you do
that measurement,

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:03.100
then you really set
goals and targets,

01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:08.540
which these set goals and
targets is the one thing that I

01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.190
unfortunately cannot teach you.

01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:13.850
Because I don't
know how to do it.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.660
I wish I could tell you
what's the best goal to do.

01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.370
10% reduction of
waste per years?

01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:20.645
Zero waste by 2020?

01:04:20.645 --> 01:04:22.240
I mean, what is the best goal?

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.170
So Alexis, you have
a better advice

01:04:24.170 --> 01:04:26.151
to our esteemed students?

01:04:26.151 --> 01:04:28.150
STUDENT: Talking it through
companies, you know.

01:04:28.150 --> 01:04:30.087
They assess where
they're at currently,

01:04:30.087 --> 01:04:31.462
what quantities--
if you're going

01:04:31.462 --> 01:04:36.120
to look at waste management,
they look at how they-- a lot

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:38.820
of companies will do a pilot
and see how they can do it

01:04:38.820 --> 01:04:41.430
within the first year and look
at what the competitors are

01:04:41.430 --> 01:04:44.350
proposing and other
people in the industry

01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:45.940
and if they're the
first of the type.

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:47.940
The one thing that I've
read in a lot of reports

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:51.050
is that, you know, we're
putting high goals out here.

01:04:51.050 --> 01:04:53.369
We may not hit them,
so better go high.

01:04:53.369 --> 01:04:55.160
Then it's almost worse
if you put low goals

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:56.810
because then you'll get
critiqued for not shooting

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:57.160
high enough.

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.710
So you're never
really going to win,

01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:01.572
but they go through
a large assessment

01:05:01.572 --> 01:05:03.780
of what they think they can
do internally and looking

01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:05.940
at competitors and kind
of gauging it that way.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:11.017
STUDENT: What are thoughts about
levels of today or levels of--

01:05:11.017 --> 01:05:11.850
PROFESSOR: Go ahead.

01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:14.200
Yeah, have some thoughts, but
you have some thoughts as well?

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:15.960
STUDENT: I'm just wondering
if that's a good way to start.

01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:17.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so that's
a good way to start.

01:05:17.240 --> 01:05:18.710
So let me just position this.

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:22.590
If you look at any company, they
have these vision goals, right?

01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:25.815
Which just put
clear to the company

01:05:25.815 --> 01:05:27.190
where are your
priorities, right?

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:30.710
We're going to have a zero
emissions car by 2050, right?

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:34.020
Maybe 2049, maybe 2030,
whatever the number is.

01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:40.380
So you definitely need to have
this idea of that vision target

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:42.380
that tends to be
super aggressive.

01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:42.980
Why?

01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:45.104
Because that just tells
you where your priority is.

01:05:45.104 --> 01:05:46.900
That's a way to say,
this matters to me.

01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.562
This is why I want to do it.

01:05:48.562 --> 01:05:50.520
And that's what you see
in all the CSR reports.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:51.850
That's the number one.

01:05:51.850 --> 01:05:55.500
The next one they do
is like Alexis said.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.370
And this goes back
to the process

01:05:58.370 --> 01:06:02.850
of setting goals and
targets in any organization.

01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:06.280
Who here has experience
in a company doing

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.445
financial targets for sales?

01:06:09.445 --> 01:06:10.422
Who has done it?

01:06:10.422 --> 01:06:12.130
Who has been part of
a process for sales?

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:13.660
How is that done?

01:06:13.660 --> 01:06:15.590
How does it happen when
you, like a company--

01:06:15.590 --> 01:06:17.750
I'm the CEO of a
company and I need

01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:20.480
to go next quarter or
next year for my guidance

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:21.730
for Wall Street.

01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:23.590
And I need to set up
goals and targets.

01:06:23.590 --> 01:06:24.450
How do I do that?

01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:26.880
STUDENT: Well, we would just
have like an annual operating

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:29.680
plan process where basically
they would bring it

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:32.135
all the representatives
from all the sales divisions

01:06:32.135 --> 01:06:33.700
and they would come
in and say here's

01:06:33.700 --> 01:06:36.284
our major-- they could come in
one by one, like, all the adds,

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:38.408
and say, here are the
customers that fall under us.

01:06:38.408 --> 01:06:39.840
Here's what we
think. [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:41.548
we forecast the business
that we're going

01:06:41.548 --> 01:06:43.085
to do based on XYZ reasons.

01:06:43.085 --> 01:06:44.460
So therefore,
[INAUDIBLE] number.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:46.340
And they would roll
all that up into one.

01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:48.865
And operation [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:48.865 --> 01:06:50.740
PROFESSOR: So they get
a meeting and everyone

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:51.573
comes with a number.

01:06:51.573 --> 01:06:54.560
And that guys went back to his
team beforehand and said, guys,

01:06:54.560 --> 01:06:56.200
I have a meeting
tomorrow with the CEO.

01:06:56.200 --> 01:06:57.840
How much are we going to sell?

01:06:57.840 --> 01:06:59.740
And the guy asked the other
guy how much I'm going to sell.

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:01.490
Eventually, someone that
really knows what happens

01:07:01.490 --> 01:07:03.160
says, oh yeah,
have 20 customers.

01:07:03.160 --> 01:07:05.080
I predict my 20% growth.

01:07:05.080 --> 01:07:06.630
I see these opportunities.

01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:08.330
And they roll it
up and then they

01:07:08.330 --> 01:07:09.886
could make some guesses, right?

01:07:09.886 --> 01:07:12.260
And they just-- I rounded up
the number [INAUDIBLE] good.

01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.920
The CEO says it doesn't
look good enough.

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:15.544
You have to do better
than this, right?

01:07:15.544 --> 01:07:16.964
And the CEO says 10% more.

01:07:16.964 --> 01:07:17.880
You say, I don't know.

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:19.050
Yes, you do it and
then you do it.

01:07:19.050 --> 01:07:20.000
And next year,
they do it, right?

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.791
And that's-- and that's
the way it happens.

01:07:21.791 --> 01:07:24.105
And I'm kind of a little
bit excited [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:24.105 --> 01:07:25.480
But this is roughly
what happens.

01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:28.050
I mean, you can make all the
nice frameworks you want.

01:07:28.050 --> 01:07:29.300
You [INAUDIBLE] to the target.

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:31.550
But this explains what happens.

01:07:31.550 --> 01:07:33.810
Someone cares about this number.

01:07:33.810 --> 01:07:36.880
They force you to think about
what's the best way to do it.

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.435
And you go back to
your team and try

01:07:38.435 --> 01:07:40.810
to find some sort of middle
ground between what you think

01:07:40.810 --> 01:07:43.880
is doable, what you
really think you can do,

01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.630
and your manager and the
CEO tries to stretch you

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:47.920
beyond that limit.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:50.344
So you do not just set a
number that makes no sense.

01:07:50.344 --> 01:07:52.510
Because everyone's going
to put a number that I know

01:07:52.510 --> 01:07:53.880
I'm going to meet.

01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:55.160
And the CEO knows this.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.422
And because of that, he
says, I want double of that.

01:07:58.422 --> 01:08:00.060
And you play the
game of tension.

01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.050
And you miss one year.

01:08:01.050 --> 01:08:05.030
You don't get the bonus and
make sure you do a better job.

01:08:05.030 --> 01:08:06.926
That process is exactly
the same process

01:08:06.926 --> 01:08:09.680
you should go for
environment targets, right?

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:11.370
It's exactly the same process.

01:08:11.370 --> 01:08:16.026
I mentioned at the end of this
long rant one important thing.

01:08:16.026 --> 01:08:18.710
Your bonus is set
to this, right?

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:20.560
So that means money.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:22.660
But some sort of incentive
is set to this process.

01:08:22.660 --> 01:08:29.810
If there's no incentive or
penalty, nothing gets done.

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:33.160
So you can get, in the
short term, some things.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.742
But in other things, you need
to provide specific targets.

01:08:36.742 --> 01:08:38.200
So this is where,
again, we go back

01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:41.250
to-- you want to do carbon
footprint emissions?

01:08:41.250 --> 01:08:45.370
You have to tie it to something
that the person can do.

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:49.270
For example, if you want to
reduce 20% of your emissions

01:08:49.270 --> 01:08:52.180
or go to the same level
of emissions as 2020

01:08:52.180 --> 01:08:55.540
based on the 2001
baseline, then you

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:58.220
have to connect those
emissions to something

01:08:58.220 --> 01:08:59.918
you can take action
on-- energy use.

01:08:59.918 --> 01:09:00.418
Right.

01:09:00.418 --> 01:09:03.904
STUDENT: Don't you run the
risk, though, of kind of,

01:09:03.904 --> 01:09:10.387
I don't know, questioning
the integrity of the process?

01:09:10.387 --> 01:09:12.470
Because then you could
have engineering in the way

01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:14.390
you're reporting or measuring.

01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:17.000
And if you tie some sort
of financial incentive

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.040
to the goals, then
there is the potential

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.890
to have a lot of effort to have
good results on paper but maybe

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:26.719
not necessarily to be driving
more [? real results. ?]

01:09:26.719 --> 01:09:28.760
STUDENT: PROFESSOR: So
that's talk about-- that's

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:30.630
a really good point.

01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:33.950
So the companies that
are successful at this,

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:36.260
they-- somehow the
measurement systems

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.130
need to be as reliable as
possible to avoid that problem.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:42.609
Because if yo don't have a good
way to measure the progress,

01:09:42.609 --> 01:09:44.500
then you can fudge the numbers.

01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.250
So you have to connect
it back to whatever

01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:48.640
metric of your
business you can get

01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:50.870
actual reliable information on.

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:53.290
And I think that's why the
leading companies, I think

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:55.580
that's why they do
better is that, sure, we

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:57.830
want to do carbon footprint
and we do with [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:57.830 --> 01:10:00.700
this big [INAUDIBLE]
protocol CDP report.

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:03.090
But somehow as
they go down, they

01:10:03.090 --> 01:10:06.720
tie this to number of miles
driven on my car, number

01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:10.760
of kilowatt hours of my-- so
that process of kind of somehow

01:10:10.760 --> 01:10:13.180
connecting these goals
and measurement systems,

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:15.781
that I think is the hard part
that companies take a long time

01:10:15.781 --> 01:10:16.280
to develop.

01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:18.480
Because information
you need to measure

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:19.540
you may not be capturing.

01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:22.120
So you have to build, let's
say, that knowledge internally

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.260
and then eventually try it.

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:23.870
But I agree.

01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:27.330
If you do have some sort of
connection to the real business

01:10:27.330 --> 01:10:32.420
operations, you cannot really
set credible targets and tie it

01:10:32.420 --> 01:10:32.920
to money.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.340
And I'll give you
another example.

01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.256
I know you have a question
before we move to--

01:10:36.256 --> 01:10:39.640
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] measurement
like in the Palm Oil case

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:43.405
and also with Chevron to do
third party verifications

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:48.668
of things just to verify
before they award incentives

01:10:48.668 --> 01:10:52.240
or peform the
bonuses or whatever.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.860
PROFESSOR: So not
all the-- so not

01:10:56.860 --> 01:10:59.370
all the performance
gives bonuses,

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:02.160
but they do have an
impact on your evaluation.

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.860
So let's suppose you don't have
to try as a bonus something,

01:11:04.860 --> 01:11:07.030
but you have to meet
certain criteria.

01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:08.530
And if you don't
meet them, you know

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:09.988
there's a risk that
your job is not

01:11:09.988 --> 01:11:12.160
going to be there for you
in two, three, four years.

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.227
No one expects so.

01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:15.560
I mean, that was your question--
was that your question?

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.690
STUDENT: I'm just saying--

01:11:16.690 --> 01:11:17.690
PROFESSOR: As a comment.

01:11:17.690 --> 01:11:21.882
STUDENT: Yeah, one way to ensure
that the system isn't being

01:11:21.882 --> 01:11:23.460
exploited is that companies--

01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:24.120
PROFESSOR: Yeah, third party.

01:11:24.120 --> 01:11:25.080
STUDENT: --use third part--

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah, absolutely.

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.030
So third party
verification is one way

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:30.050
to try to achieve
that balance and make

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:31.620
sure you have a third--
especially as you go deeper

01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:32.495
in your supply chain.

01:11:32.495 --> 01:11:35.254
But I do want to emphasize
that to be serious--

01:11:35.254 --> 01:11:37.420
I"m not saying that these
companies are not serious,

01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:41.040
but to be able to fully embed
it to your business capabilities

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:45.150
as a company, somehow you need
to set goals and targets that

01:11:45.150 --> 01:11:47.700
are tied to ways that
are credible measures.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:50.900
You cannot just be do your-
everyone does their estimation

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.482
of CO2, right?

01:11:52.482 --> 01:11:55.740
It needs to be, I
have a CO2 calculator

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:59.190
that is somewhere in my system
that I can click a button

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:01.170
and know how things are going.

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:04.542
If I cannot do that, then this
is your CSR report that happens

01:12:04.542 --> 01:12:05.500
at the end of the year.

01:12:07.919 --> 01:12:09.710
Let me just differentiate
what I just said.

01:12:09.710 --> 01:12:11.180
So everyone can
come after the fact

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:14.585
that I can do an estimation of
CO2, hire MIT, hire Stanford,

01:12:14.585 --> 01:12:17.470
and I can go in and spend
six months, right, and do--

01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:19.670
this how much CO2 you save.

01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:22.040
Great, but that doesn't
mean that the company is

01:12:22.040 --> 01:12:23.330
doing anything right.

01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:26.550
If you're a manager, you have
to get a report every semester,

01:12:26.550 --> 01:12:28.200
every quarter, and
this is how we're

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:29.537
doing so you can take action.

01:12:29.537 --> 01:12:30.995
And the only way
you can do that is

01:12:30.995 --> 01:12:34.500
to connect that measurement
of environmental performance

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.500
to something that you are
collecting in your day

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:41.420
to day operation, whatever
it is-- energy use, again,

01:12:41.420 --> 01:12:45.120
number of tons of miles
you sold to waste disposal.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.090
Something, right?

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:48.554
And someone has to figure
out how that number connects

01:12:48.554 --> 01:12:49.970
with the environmental
goal you're

01:12:49.970 --> 01:12:54.450
trying to achieve and set
that target to that metric.

01:12:54.450 --> 01:12:56.780
This process is
what is difficult.

01:12:56.780 --> 01:13:01.050
And that's why the measurement
is kind of the tricky part

01:13:01.050 --> 01:13:04.200
because companies are
not used to measure.

01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:06.330
And if you do not do
that, the only thing

01:13:06.330 --> 01:13:10.670
you have is a great
CSR reporting machine.

01:13:10.670 --> 01:13:12.920
You are not really
changing your business

01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:15.120
or your suppliers' businesses.

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.140
You have a great CSR
reporting, which is needed.

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.490
It's a precondition.

01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:20.520
Unless you know how
to do it yourself,

01:13:20.520 --> 01:13:21.570
you cannot put it
in your metric.

01:13:21.570 --> 01:13:22.480
You have to trust it.

01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:24.074
You have to develop
the expertise.

01:13:24.074 --> 01:13:25.490
You have to have
the right people.

01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:28.432
You have the SAP systems to be
rolled out whatever you use it.

01:13:28.432 --> 01:13:29.390
Someone needs to do it.

01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:31.410
If you don't have
it, you cannot do it.

01:13:31.410 --> 01:13:32.749
And this goes back to suppliers.

01:13:32.749 --> 01:13:34.540
And we'll talk about
suppliers in a second.

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:36.915
But is there any questions or
comments about what I said?

01:13:36.915 --> 01:13:39.397
I want to make
sure this is clear.

01:13:39.397 --> 01:13:41.730
STUDENT: A lot of the incentive
is based on stock price.

01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:43.521
Companies don't really
give out big checks.

01:13:43.521 --> 01:13:45.740
They give out 20
shares or whatever.

01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.890
And there's a conflict
between getting that share

01:13:47.890 --> 01:13:50.237
price to increase and
doing the right thing.

01:13:50.237 --> 01:13:51.945
For companies that
have target incentives

01:13:51.945 --> 01:13:54.660
that are stock driven, do
you have any suggestions

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:57.154
for setting goals and targets?

01:13:57.154 --> 01:13:58.820
PROFESSOR: That's
where-- the only thing

01:13:58.820 --> 01:14:01.550
I like there is the Dow Jones
sustainable index even though I

01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:03.540
hate that index.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:06.170
It's a great index because
at least people connect it

01:14:06.170 --> 01:14:07.726
to stock prices in
a more direct way.

01:14:07.726 --> 01:14:09.850
Even though the connection
is because of sales MIT,

01:14:09.850 --> 01:14:13.240
the majority is revenue-- like,
30% of [INAUDIBLE] is revenue.

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:15.060
But they have at
least some metrics

01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:17.750
that are environmental
transparency that people try

01:14:17.750 --> 01:14:19.760
to connect with stock prices.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:22.890
I have to say that
public companies have

01:14:22.890 --> 01:14:26.500
a really hard time to make
these aspirational goals

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.670
because they're not
connected to value directly.

01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:32.130
This long term,
short term trade off

01:14:32.130 --> 01:14:35.980
that prevents them of embedding
a good sustainability practice

01:14:35.980 --> 01:14:37.380
is very hard.

01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:40.280
Let me give you
the other answer.

01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:44.310
Who was talking here?

01:14:44.310 --> 01:14:47.630
Seventh Generation said
that, although they're not

01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:48.660
publicly traded.

01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:51.240
They said, our
shareholders know they're

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.470
getting lower return of
reinvestment than other.

01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:58.340
And they buy our stock with
that understanding, that?

01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:03.310
Unilever shareholders know that
Unilever is making some trade

01:15:03.310 --> 01:15:06.200
offs for the long term and
they're buying their stock.

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:08.680
Now, the promise
and the belief is

01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.110
that they're going to recover
that value over the long run.

01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:14.626
But ultimately
speaking, I do not

01:15:14.626 --> 01:15:16.500
think there's a good
connection you can make.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:17.980
Allow me to be totally honest.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:22.270
I have not seen it that you can
make a real concrete connection

01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:24.780
between stock price
and sustainability

01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:25.852
in the short term.

01:15:25.852 --> 01:15:27.310
What I've heard
the argument, which

01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:29.930
I think is a real
argument, is a company that

01:15:29.930 --> 01:15:33.860
can develop this kind
of system is a company

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:36.620
that must have a really
sophisticated management, which

01:15:36.620 --> 01:15:39.100
means this company must be
run by smart people, which

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.860
means this company must
be making some good money.

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:43.846
But this is a very
indirect argument.

01:15:43.846 --> 01:15:44.970
It's not a direct argument.

01:15:44.970 --> 01:15:45.790
Oh, you did this?

01:15:45.790 --> 01:15:47.040
You can get money back.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:50.310
It's more, if you're willing
to pull this off and not

01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:54.250
crash your business, that means
that you are really well run

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:56.310
management company
and we believe

01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:59.430
that you are going to be
able to achieve other things.

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.501
Because besides all
your complexity,

01:16:01.501 --> 01:16:03.750
you have been able to embed
sustainability in your day

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:04.500
to day operations.

01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.445
Is that-- it's kind
of a poor answer.

01:16:06.445 --> 01:16:08.100
STUDENT: --Wall Street is
going to let you get away

01:16:08.100 --> 01:16:09.230
with it for so long, right?

01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:10.646
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
for so long, yes.

01:16:10.646 --> 01:16:13.520
At some point, that's kind of
an argument of capabilities

01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:16.538
more than an argument of
delivering results is just,

01:16:16.538 --> 01:16:17.996
you should be able
to do this well.

01:16:17.996 --> 01:16:19.871
STUDENT: Just to quickly
build on this today,

01:16:19.871 --> 01:16:25.162
we actually had the CEO
of-- I'm going to remember

01:16:25.162 --> 01:16:27.080
the name of the company
in a little while.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:29.690
They were investing
not in sustainability

01:16:29.690 --> 01:16:31.945
in the green part
by [? Mosely ?]

01:16:31.945 --> 01:16:35.060
and investing in their
employees and paying them

01:16:35.060 --> 01:16:36.020
higher-- Costco.

01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:38.480
PROFESSOR: Costco--
Costco is big.

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:42.010
STUDENT: --while still offering
low prices to customers.

01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:44.550
And he was mentioning--
like, he was talking

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:47.046
about his experience of
having a really hard time

01:16:47.046 --> 01:16:48.545
at the beginning
when they initially

01:16:48.545 --> 01:16:53.150
went public because people in
Wall Street didn't understand.

01:16:53.150 --> 01:16:58.230
But they kept true to their
strategy and that now,

01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:01.460
their stock price has
gone up significantly.

01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:05.440
And people who buy their
stock and trade it and it's

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.800
actually a very valuable stock.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.780
But then it does take time.

01:17:09.780 --> 01:17:12.490
If your entire
strategy is long term,

01:17:12.490 --> 01:17:16.390
you kind of wait for Wall Street
to understand it [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:17.250
and into it.

01:17:17.250 --> 01:17:20.284
But if you have a
strategy, it does work.

01:17:20.284 --> 01:17:22.060
You wait for them, though.

01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:25.673
PROFESSOR: I think that's
the-- yeah, I agree.

01:17:25.673 --> 01:17:27.590
I think that's possible.

01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:28.700
Yes, it's always possible.

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:30.490
Let me actually
say two more things

01:17:30.490 --> 01:17:33.160
on setting goals and targets.

01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:38.240
So I'm trying to
emphasize this point.

01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.230
Supplier selection--
let's talk about when

01:17:40.230 --> 01:17:42.122
you want to go to your
tier one suppliers

01:17:42.122 --> 01:17:43.330
and make them greener, right?

01:17:43.330 --> 01:17:46.840
And you want to really make
them part of your strategy.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.380
If there's no measure in your
scorecards to your supplier

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:54.910
selection, this means nothing.

01:17:54.910 --> 01:17:57.960
So when the buyer is
sitting in the table

01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:01.860
and he has to make a decision
on which supplier to select

01:18:01.860 --> 01:18:08.530
and there's no metric there that
says sustainability, trust me.

01:18:08.530 --> 01:18:10.730
That person is going to
do their best effort.

01:18:10.730 --> 01:18:14.490
Now, the problem is if
you have never done it,

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:15.534
how do you start?

01:18:15.534 --> 01:18:17.200
How do you start
putting a metric there?

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:19.790
You have to give people--
educate them first.

01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:23.280
You have to first-- I recommend
you to measure this, right?

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.640
It's not part of our
evaluation process.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.129
You do that for
two or three years.

01:18:27.129 --> 01:18:29.420
You first understand your
capability of your suppliers.

01:18:29.420 --> 01:18:30.677
You have to get to know them.

01:18:30.677 --> 01:18:31.760
You get their information.

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.801
That's why the CDP report
actually is quite good.

01:18:33.801 --> 01:18:35.360
You have a structured processes.

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.550
They start knowing, you
know, we should mention your

01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:38.490
[INAUDIBLE].

01:18:38.490 --> 01:18:38.991
Oh really?

01:18:38.991 --> 01:18:40.115
OK, let me start measuring.

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:41.520
And the next year
they come back.

01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:43.390
I still do not
know how to do it.

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:44.700
The next year, they come back.

01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.020
And eventually, they
get good at measuring.

01:18:47.020 --> 01:18:48.410
You do the same for waste.

01:18:48.410 --> 01:18:50.510
You do the same for the
things you care about.

01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:54.110
You have to somehow
teach them what it takes

01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:57.244
to measure what you care about.

01:18:57.244 --> 01:18:58.910
Once they have that
in a few iterations,

01:18:58.910 --> 01:19:01.630
then you can really start
putting it in a contract.

01:19:01.630 --> 01:19:04.810
And I think if you see
what companies have done--

01:19:04.810 --> 01:19:06.640
whom I was talking recently?

01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:12.220
Yes, this may not be public yet.

01:19:12.220 --> 01:19:14.650
So they have been asking
for their sustainability

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:16.880
metric from their
suppliers for five years.

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:19.720
And next year is
going to be mandatory.

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:22.710
It's going to be a requirement
for buying products.

01:19:22.710 --> 01:19:25.440
It's a big CPG company-- huge.

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.560
And they have done all the
traditional greenhouse gas

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:30.760
metrics, waste metrics,
traditional ones.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.680
And they have always
said information for you

01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:34.452
to look into that information.

01:19:34.452 --> 01:19:36.410
Starting next year, it's
going to be mandatory.

01:19:36.410 --> 01:19:39.270
And if yo don't have it,
you're not our supplier.

01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:41.770
And in five years, they're
going to reduce by 20%.

01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:45.360
So I'm pointing out is that
there's a first phase where you

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.120
just ask for the information.

01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:51.720
So people build their own metric
systems you cannot expect them

01:19:51.720 --> 01:19:53.770
to be sustainable if
you have never measured.

01:19:53.770 --> 01:19:56.350
So by asking your supplies
for the information,

01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:59.580
even though it's not in
the scorecard of selection,

01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.340
you start this cycle for them.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:04.810
This is what matters to me.

01:20:04.810 --> 01:20:06.540
When I'm buying
from you, I want you

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:08.450
to tell me how much
energy you use,

01:20:08.450 --> 01:20:10.370
how much waste you generate.

01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:11.620
Oh, it matters to you?

01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.690
So I better start measuring it.

01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:16.820
You somehow start creating
this cycle with your suppliers.

01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:20.710
But only the moment where
you change this cycle into,

01:20:20.710 --> 01:20:24.730
I bring it into your
procurement organization

01:20:24.730 --> 01:20:29.210
as a decision making process
like price, quality, safety,

01:20:29.210 --> 01:20:31.530
CO2 reduction.

01:20:31.530 --> 01:20:36.680
Only at that time it really
becomes part of your business.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:39.350
Otherwise, it's
just good wishing.

01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:40.860
That is a long process.

01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:43.284
So what I just said
is a five year cycle,

01:20:43.284 --> 01:20:45.200
especially when you talk
about a large company

01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.590
with many, many suppliers.

01:20:46.590 --> 01:20:49.710
Great example of these--
Natura in Brazil.

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:54.287
They have specific targets for
the supplies of CO2 reduction.

01:20:54.287 --> 01:20:55.370
They have their templates.

01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:58.590
This is how you fill it
out, how much energy you do.

01:20:58.590 --> 01:21:00.472
This is exactly what
you expect from them.

01:21:00.472 --> 01:21:02.055
And this is exactly
how much reduction

01:21:02.055 --> 01:21:03.840
I expect from you year to year.

01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.090
And if you don't get it,
you're no longer my supplier.

01:21:07.090 --> 01:21:09.135
But this took some time,
even though they're

01:21:09.135 --> 01:21:13.680
a very sustainable
company as a whole.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:15.850
And this is what
you do internally.

01:21:15.850 --> 01:21:17.790
And of course, always
you have to stay

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:21.120
in tuned with your moral
compass, your partner that

01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:25.630
tell you which are the
issues that you think,

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:28.370
which areas of the world you
have to be worried about that

01:21:28.370 --> 01:21:30.390
could have more
regulation, right?

01:21:30.390 --> 01:21:32.030
How can you make sure
your reputation--

01:21:32.030 --> 01:21:34.880
you have to defend
all those dimensions.

01:21:34.880 --> 01:21:40.270
So this is, I think, how you
can develop long term strategy.

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:42.250
So we have to wrap up now.

01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:46.940
But on Wednesday, we're going
to hear someone from a company

01:21:46.940 --> 01:21:48.661
hopefully tell them
how they did it.

01:21:48.661 --> 01:21:50.160
So keep some of
these things in mind

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:52.639
to see if we can identify
these patterns going or not.

01:21:52.639 --> 01:21:53.930
I think some of them are there.

01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:54.590
Others are not.

01:21:54.590 --> 01:21:57.990
So we'll see how good they
are in their strategy.

01:21:57.990 --> 01:22:01.990
Ask tough questions and that
I wanted to do more guidance,

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.995
but I talk a lot.

01:22:02.995 --> 01:22:05.120
For the team project-- so
what we want in your team

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.760
project is to not only both of
you dividing your companies,

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:11.310
but actually comparing
them, discussing

01:22:11.310 --> 01:22:13.900
what makes them better,
and eventually trying

01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:16.180
to make an assessment
is, is this company

01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.362
that has a higher ranking
in CDP deserve this or not?

01:22:19.362 --> 01:22:21.820
And this is why they deserve
it based on some of the things

01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:23.720
we've talked so far, all right?

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:26.930
OK, thank you so much and
I will see you on Wednesday

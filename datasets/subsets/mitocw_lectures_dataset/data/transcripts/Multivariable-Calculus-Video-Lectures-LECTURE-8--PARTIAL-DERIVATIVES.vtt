00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So, so far, we've seen things
about vectors,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
equation of planes,
motions in space,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and so on.
Basically we've done geometry

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
in space.
But, calculus,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
really, is about studying
functions.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now, we're going to actually
move on to studying functions of

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
several variables.
So, this new unit,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
what we'll do over the next
three weeks or so will be about

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
functions of several variables
and their derivatives.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
OK, so first of all,
we should try to figure out how

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
we are going to think about
functions.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So, remember,
if you have a function of one

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
variable, that means you have a
quantity that depends on one

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
parameter.
Maybe f depends on the variable

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
x.
And, for example,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
a function that you all know is
f of x equals sin(x).

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And, the way we would represent
that is maybe just by plotting

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the graph of the function.
So, the graph of a function,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
we plot y = f(x).
And, the graph of a sine

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:45.000
function that looks like this.
OK, so now, let's say that we

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
had, actually,
a function of two variables.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
So, that means that the value
of F depends actually on two

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
different parameters,
say, if the variables are x and

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
y,
or they can have any names you

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
want.
So, given values of the two

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
parameters, x and y,
the function will give us a

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
number that we'll call f(x,
y).

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
That depends on x and y
according to some formula,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
OK, not very surprising so far.
So, for example,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I can give you the function
f(x, y) = x^2 y^2.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
And, of course,
as with functions of one

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
variable, we don't need things
to be defined everywhere.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Sometimes there is the domain
of definition.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So, this one is defined all the
time.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
But, if I tell you,
say, f of x,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000
y equals square root of y,
well, this is only defined if y

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000
is nonnegative.
If I tell you f(x,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000
y) equals one over x y,
that's only defined if x y is

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
not zero, and so on.
Now, so these are mathematical

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
examples given by explicit
formulas.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And, of course,
there's physical examples.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000
For example,
so examples coming from real

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
life, so for example,
you can look at the temperature

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
at the certain point on the
surface of the earth.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, you use maybe longitude and
latitude; that's x and y.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
And then you have f(x,
y) equals the temperature at

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that point.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
In fact, because temperature
depends also may be on how high

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
up you are.
It depends on elevation.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So, it's actually a function of
maybe x, y, z.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
And, it also depends on time.
So, in fact,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
maybe it's a function of t in x
y z coordinates in space.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
So, you see that real-world
functions can depends on a lot

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
of variables.
So, our goal will be to

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
understand how to deal with
that.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
OK, so now you will see very
soon, but actually it's already

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000
tricky enough to picture a
function of two variables.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
So, we are going to focus on
the case of functions of two

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
variables.
And then, we'll see that if we

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
have more than two variables,
then it's harder to plot the

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
function.
We cannot draw with the graph

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
looks like anymore.
But, the tools are the same,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the notion of partial
derivatives, grade and vector,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
and so on,
all the tools that we will

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
develop work exactly the same
way no matter how many variables

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
you have.
So, I'll say,

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:41.000
for simplicity -- -- we'll
focus mostly on two or sometimes

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.000
three variables.
But, it works the same in any

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:56.000
number of variables.
OK, so the first question is

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:05.000
how to visualize a function of
two variables.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So, the first thing we can do
is try to draw the graph of f.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:19.000
So, maybe I should say f --
which is a function of two

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
variables.
So, the first answer will be,

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
we can try to look at it's
graph.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
And, the idea is the same as
with one variable,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000
namely, we look at all the
possible values of the

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
parameters,
x and y, and for each of them,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
we plot a point whose height is
the value of a function at these

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
parameters.
So, we'll plot,

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
let's say, z equals f(x,
y).

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.000
And, now that will become,
actually, a surface in space.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
OK, so for each value of x and
y, yeah, we have x,

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
y in the x, y plane,
then we'll plot the point in

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.000
space at position x,
y.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000
And, z equals f of x, y.
OK, and if we take all of these

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000
points together,
they will give us some surface

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:24.000
that sits in space.
Yes?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Oh, a function of two
variables, shorthand.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Well, let's say how to
visualize a function of two

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
variables.
OK, so, how do we do that

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000
concretely?
Say that I give you a formula

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
for f.
How do we try to represent it?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:57.000
So, let's do our first example.
Let's say I give you a function

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
f(x, y) = -y.
OK, so it looks a little bit

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
silly because it doesn't depend
on x.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
But, that's not the problem.
It's still a valid function of

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
x and y.
It just happens to be constant

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
with respect to x.
So, to draw the graph we look

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
at the surface in space defined
by z equals y.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
What kind of surface is that?
It's a plane, OK?

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000
And, if we want to draw it,
z equals minus y will look,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
well, let's put y axis.
Let's put x axis.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Let's put z axis.
If I look at what happens in

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
the y, z plane in the plane of a
blackboard, it will just look

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
like a line that goes downward
with slope one.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
OK, so it will be this.
And, what happens if I change x?

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Well, if I change x,
nothing happens because x

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
doesn't appear in this equation.
So, in fact,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000
if instead of setting x equal
to zero I set x equal to one,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
I'm in front of the blackboard,
or minus one at the back.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Well, it still looks exactly
the same.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.000
So, I have this plane that
actually contains the x axis and

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:22.000
slopes downwards with slope one.
It's kind of hard to draw.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Now, you see immediately what
the big problem with graphs will

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
be.
But, these pictures are hard to

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000
read.
But that's our first graph.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:41.000
OK, a question so far?
OK, so let's say that we have a

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
slightly more complicated
function.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.000
How do we see it?
So, let's draw another example.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Let's say I give you f(x,
y) = 1 - x^2-y^2.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So, we should try to picture
what the surface z=1- x^2-y^2

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
looks like.
So, how do we do that?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Well, maybe you are very fast
and figured out what it looks

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000
like.
But, if not,

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
then we need to work piece by
piece.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So, maybe it will help if we
understand first what it does in

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:35.000
the plane of the blackboard.
So, if we look at it in the y,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.000
z plane, that means we set x
equal to zero.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000
And then, z becomes 1 - y^2.
What is that?

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
It's a parabola pointing
downwards, and starting at one.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
So, we should draw maybe this
downward parabola.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000
It starts at one and it cuts
the y axis at one.

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
When y is one,
that gives us zero.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
So, we might have an idea of
what it might look like,

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
or maybe not.
Let's get more slices.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Let's see what it does in the
x, z plane, this other vertical

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
plane that's coming towards us.
So, in the x,

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
z plane, if we set y equal to
zero, we get z equals one minus

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
x^2.
It's, again,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000
a parabola going downwards.
OK, so I'm going to try to draw

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
a parabola that goes downward,
but now to the front and to the

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.000
back.
So, we are starting to have a

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
slightly better idea but we
still don't know whether the

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
cross section of this thing
might be round,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
square, something else.
So, it wants more confirmation.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:16.000
We might want to also figure
out where the surface intersects

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the x, y plane.
So, we hit the x,

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:29.000
y plane when z equals zero.
That means 1-x^2-y^2 should be

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000
0, that becomes x^2 y^2 = 1.
That is a circle of radius 1.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.000
That's the unit size.
So, that means that here,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
we actually have the unit
circle.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
And now, you should imagine
that you have this thing that

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
when you slice it by a vertical
plane, looks like a downwards

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
parabola.
And, it's actually a surface of

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
revolution.
You can rotate it around the z

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
axis, OK?
Now, if you stare long enough

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
at that equation,
you'll actually see that,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
yes, we know that it had to be
like that.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
But, see, so these are useful
ways of trying to guess what the

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
graph looks like.
Of course, the other way is to

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
just ask your computer to do it.
And then, you know,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:30.000
you will get that kind of
formula.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.000
OK, well, I can leave it on if
you want.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
No, because I plotted a
different function that I will

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.000
show you later.
So, it goes this way.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000
I mean, if you want,
it's really going downward.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Yes, I agree that the sheet is
upside down.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000
That's because I plotted
something else.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:58.000
OK, so, in fact,
so I plotted in my computer was

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
actually x^2 y^2 that looks like
that.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000
See, it's the same with a
parabola going upwards.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000
If you want to see more
examples, I have various

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000
examples to show,
well, here's the graph,

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
y^2-x^2.
See, so that one is kind of

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
interesting.
It looks like a saddle.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:29.000
If you look at it in the y,
z plane, then it's a parabola

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000
going up, z = y^2.
And, that's what we see to the

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
left and to the right.
But, if you put it in the x,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
z plane, then that's a parabola
going downwards,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
z = - x^2.
So, we have a parabola going

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:48.000
downwards in one direction,
upwards in the other one.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And together,
they form this surface.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
And of course,
you can plot much more

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000
complicated functions.
So, this one,

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:00.000
well, if you can read very
small things,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
you can see the formula.
It doesn't matter,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:09.000
just to show you that you can
put a formula into a computer:

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:18.000
it will show you a picture.
OK, so that's pretty good.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
I mean, you can see that it can
get a bit cluttered because

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
maybe those features that are
hidden behind,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
or maybe we have trouble seeing
if we don't have a computer,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
that looks very readable.
But, this is kind of hard to

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
visualize sometimes.
So, there is another way to

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
plot the functions of two
variables.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:47.000
And, let's call it the contour
plot.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
So, the contour plot is a very
elegant solution to the problem

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
that it's difficult to draw to
space pictures on a sheet of

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
paper or on a blackboard.
So, instead,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:02.000
let's try to represent the
function of two variables by

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
just the map,
you know, the same way that

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
when you walk around,
you have actually geographical

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
maps that fit on a piece of
paper that tell you about what

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000
the real world looks like.
So, what contour plot looks

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:22.000
something like this?
So, it's an x, y plot.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
And, that, you have a bunch of
curves.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000
And, what the curves represent
are the elevations on the graph.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000
So, for example,
this curve might correspond to

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000
all the points where f(x,
y) = 1.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:46.000
And, that curve might be all
the points where f=2 and f=3 and

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
so on, OK?
So, when you see you this kind

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
of plot, you're supposed to
think that the graph of the

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000
function sits somewhere in space
above that.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000
It's like a map telling you how
high things are.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And, what you would want to do
with the function,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
really, is be able to tell
quickly what's the value at a

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
given point?
Well, let's say I want to look

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.000
at that point.
I know that f is somewhere

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
between 1 and 2.
Actually, it's much faster to

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
read than the graph.
On the graph I might have to

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
look carefully,
and then measure things,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
and so on.
Here, I can just raise the

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
value of f by comparing with the
nearby lines.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
OK, so let me try to make that
more precise.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:41.000
So, it shows all the points --
-- where f(x,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:53.000
y) equals some fixed values,
some fixed constants.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And, these constants typically
are chosen at regular intervals.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
For example,
here I chose one,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
two, three, and they could
continue with zero minus one,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
and so on.
So, one way to think about it,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
how does this relate to the
graph?

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Well, that's the same thing as
cutting, I mean,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:40.000
we slice the graph by
horizontal planes.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
So, horizontal planes have
equations of a form z equals

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
some constant,
z equals zero,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
z equals one,
z equals two,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
and so on.
So, maybe the graph of my

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000
function will be some sort of
plot out there.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And, if I slice it by the plane
z equals one,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
then I will get the level
curve,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:14.000
which is the point where f(x,
y) = 1,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:24.000
and so, that's called a level
curve of f.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:32.000
OK, and so we repeat the
process with maybe z equals two,

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000
and we get another level curve,
and so on.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:44.000
And, then we squish all of them
up, and that's how we get the

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
contour plot.
OK, so each of these lines,

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
imagine that this is like some
mountain or something that you

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
are hiking on.
Each of these lines tells you

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.000
how you could move to stay at a
constant height if you want to

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
get to the other side of the
mountain but without ever going

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
up or down.
You would just walk along that

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
path, and it will get you there
without effort.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
So, in fact,
if you have been talking about

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
hiking on mountains,
well, that's exactly what a

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.000
topographical map is about.
So, I need to zoom a bit.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
So, a topographic map,
this one from the US geological

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
survey shows you,
basically, all the level curves

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000
of an altitude function on a
piece of land.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000
So, you know that if you walk
right along these curves,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
you will stay along the same
height.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And you know that if you walk
towards, these don't have

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
numbers.
Let me find a place with

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
numbers.
Here, there is a 500 in the

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
middle.
So, you know that if you walk

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
on the line that says 500,
you stay always at 500 meters

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000
in elevation.
If you walk towards the

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
mountain that I think is below
it, then you will go up,

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
and so on.
So, you can see,

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
for example,
here there's a peak,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
and here there is a valley with
the river in it,

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
and the altitudes go down,
and then back up again on the

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
other side.
OK, so that's an example of a

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000
contour plot of a function.
Of course, we don't have a

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
formula for that function,
but we have a contour plot,

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
and that's what we need
actually to understand what's

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:36.000
going on there.
OK, any questions?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
No?
OK, so another example of

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
contour plots,
well, you've probably seen

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
various versions of these
temperature maps.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000
So, that's supposed to be how
warm it is right now.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
So, this one is color-coded.
Instead of having curves,

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
it has all these colors.
But, the effect is the same.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000
If you look at the separations
between consecutive colors,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
these are the level curves of a
function that tells you the

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000
temperature at a given point.
OK, so these are examples of

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:24.000
contour plots in real life.
OK, no questions?

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
No?
OK, so basically,

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000
one of the goals that one
should try to achieve at this

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
point is becoming familiar with
the contour plot,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
the graph,
and how to view and deal with

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:39.000
functions.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.000
[APPLAUSE]
OK, so -- Let's do an example.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Well, let's do a couple of
examples.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
So, let's start with f(x,y) = -
y.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
And, I'm going to take the same
two examples as there to start

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.000
with so that we see the relation
between the graph and the

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000
contour plots.
So, let's try to plot it.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000
So, we are asked for the level
curve, f equals 0 for this one?

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Well, f is zero when y is zero.
So, that's the x axis.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.000
OK, so that's the level, zero.
Where's the level one?

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Well, f is one when negative y
is one.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
That means when y is negative
one.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:57.000
So, you go to minus one,
and that will be where my level

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
one is, and so on.
f is two when y is negative

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
two.
F is negative one when y is

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000
one, and so on.
Is that convincing?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Do you see how we got that?
OK, let me do it again.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000
I don't see anybody nodding,
so that's kind of bad news.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000
So, if I want to know,
where is the level curve,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
say, one, I try to set f equals
to one.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Let's do this one.
f equals one means that

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
negative y is one means that y
is minus one,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:43.000
and y equals minus one is this
horizontal line on this chart.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
OK, and same with the others.
So, you can see on the map that

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
the value of a function doesn't
depend on x.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
If you move parallel to the x
axis, nothing happens.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
If you move in the y direction,
it decreases at a constant

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.000
rate.
That's why the contours are

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:03.000
evenly spaced.
How spaced out they are tells

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
you, actually,
how steep things are.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:08.000
So, that corresponds exactly to
that picture,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000
except that here we draw x
coming to the front,

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:14.000
and y to the right.
So, you have to rotate the map

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000
by 90� to get to that.
It's an unfortunate consequence

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
of the usual way of plotting
things in space.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000
OK, so these horizontal lines
here correspond actually to

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
horizontal lines here.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:54.000
OK, second example.
Let's do 1-x^2-y^2.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:00.000
OK, or maybe I will write it as
1 - (x^2 y^2).

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.000
It's really the same thing.
So, x, y, let's see,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000
where is this function equal to
zero?

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Well, we said f is zero in the
unit circle.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:32.000
OK, so, the zero level,
well, let's say that this is my

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
unit.
That's where it's at zero.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:48.000
What about f equals one?
Well, that's when x^2 y^2 = 0.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Well, that's only going to be
here.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:00.000
So, that's just a single point.
What about f equals minus one?

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000
That's when x^2 y^2 =2.
That's a circle of radius

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
square root of two,
which is about 1.4.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000
So, it's somewhere here.
Then, minus two,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000
similarly, will be x^2 y^2 = 3.
Square root of three is about

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
1.7.
And then, minus three will be

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
of radius two,
and so on.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
So, what I want to show here is
that they are getting closer and

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000
closer apart,
OK?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000
So, first it's concentric
circles that tells us that we

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
have a shape that's a solid of
the graph is going to be a

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
surface of revolution.
Things don't change if I rotate.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
And second, the level curves
are getting closer and closer to

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:59.000
each other.
That means it's getting steeper

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000
and steeper because I have to
travel a shorter distance if I

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
want my altitude to change by
one.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000
OK, so, this top here is kind
of flat.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
And then it gets steeper and
steeper.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
And, that's what we observe on
that picture there.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:24.000
OK, so just to show you a few
more, where did I put my,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:30.000
so, for x^2 y^2,
the contour plot looks like

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.000
this.
Maybe actually I'll make it.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
OK, so it looks exactly the
same as this one.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
But, the difference is if you
can see the numbers which are

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.000
not there,
so you can see them,

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
then you would know that
instead of decreasing as we move

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000
out,
this one is increasing as we go

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
out.
OK, so that's where we use,

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
actually, the labels on the
level curves that tell us

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
whether things are going up or
down.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000
But, the contour plots look
exactly the same.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:14.000
For the next one I had,
I think, was y^2-x^2.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
So, the contour plot,
well, let me actually zoom out.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
So, the contour plot looks like
that.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
So, the level curve
corresponding to zero is

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
actually two diagonal lines.
And, if you look on the plot,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000
say that you started at the
saddle point in the middle and

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:33.000
you try to stay at the same
level.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
So, it looks like a mountain
pass, right?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Well, there's actually four
directions from that point that

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.000
you can go staying at the same
height.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
And actually,
on the map, they look exactly

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
like this, too,
these crossing lines.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
OK, so, these are things that
go on the side of the two

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
mountains that are to the left
and right, and stay at the same

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
height as the mountain pass.
On the other hand,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
if you go along the y
direction, to the left or to the

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
right, then you go towards
positive values.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:11.000
And, if you go along the x
axis, then you get towards

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:18.000
negative values.
OK, the equation for,

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000
the function was y^2-x^2.
So, you can try to plot them by

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
hand and confirmed that it does
look like that.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
But, I trust my computer.
And, finally,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
this one, well,
so the contour plot looks a bit

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
complicated.
But, you can see two things.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
In the middle,
you can see these two origins

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.000
with these concentric circles
which are not really circles,

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000
but, you know,
these closed curves that are

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
concentric.
And, they correspond to the two

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000
mountains.
And then, at some point in the

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
middle, we have a mountain pass.
And there, we see the two

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000
crossing lines again,
like, on the plot of y^2-x^2.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000
And so, at this saddle point
here, if we go north or south,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
then we go down on either side
to the Valley.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:17.000
And, if we go east or west,
then we go towards the

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
mountains.
We'll go up.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
OK, does that make sense a
little bit?

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.000
OK, so, reading plots is not
easy, but hopefully we'll get

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
used to it very soon.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000
OK, so actually let's say,
well, OK, so,

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
I want to point out one thing.
The contour plot tells us,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
actually, what happens when we
move, when we change x and y.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
So, if I change the value of x
and y, that means I'm moving

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
east-west or north-south on the
map.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:12.000
And then, I can ask myself,
is the value of the function

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
increase or decrease in each of
these situations?

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Well, that's the kind of thing
that the contour plot can tell

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
me very quickly.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000
So -- OK, so say,
for example,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
that I have a piece of contour
plot.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
That looks, you know,
like that.

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Maybe this is f equals one,
and this is f equals two.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:13.000
And here, this is f equals zero.
And, let's say that I start at

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
the point, say,
at this point.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:23.000
OK, so here I have (x0, y0).
And, the question I might ask

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000
myself is if I change x or y,
how does f change?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Well, the contour plot tells me
that if x increases,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:41.000
and I keep y constant,
then what happens to f(x,

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
y)?
Well, it will increase because

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
if I move to the right,
then I go from one to a value

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
bigger than one.
I don't know exactly how much,

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
but I know that somewhere
between one and two,

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000
it's more than one.
If x decreases,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
then f decreases.
And, similarly,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
I can tell that if y increases,
then f, well,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000
it looks like if I increase y,
then f will also increase.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
And, if y decreases,
then f decreases.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
And, that's the kind of
qualitative analysis that we can

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
do easily from the contour plot.
But, maybe we'd like to

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
actually be more precise in
that, and tell how fast f

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
changes if I change x or y.
OK, so to find the rate of

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
change, that's exactly where we
use derivatives.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:47.000
So -- So, we are going to have
to deal with partial

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:58.000
derivatives.
So, I will explain to you soon

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000
why partial.
So, let me just remind you

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:12.000
first, if you have a function of
one variable,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:18.000
then so let's say f of x,
then you have a derivative,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
f prime of x is also called
df/dx.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:31.000
And, it's defined as a limit
when delta x goes to zero of the

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000
change in f.
Sorry, it's not going to fit.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:42.000
I have to go to the next line.
It's going to be the limit as

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
delta x goes to zero of the rate
of change.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
So, the change in f between x
and x plus delta x divided by

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:56.000
delta x.
Sometimes you write delta f for

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
the change in f divided by delta
x.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And then, you take the limit of
this rate of increase as delta x

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.000
goes to zero.
Now, of course,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
if you have a formula for f,
then you know,

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
at least you should know,
I suspect most of you know how

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:19.000
to actually take the derivative
of a function from its formula.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:30.000
So -- Now, how do we do that?
Sorry, and I should also tell

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.000
you what this means on the
graph.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
So, if I plot the graph of a
function, and to have my point,

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
x, and here I have f of x,
how do I see the derivative?

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Well, I look at the tangent
line to the graph,

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
and the slope of the tangent
line is f prime of x,

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
OK?
And, not every function has a

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
derivative.
You have functions that are not

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000
regular enough to actually have
a derivative.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
So, in this class,
we are not going to actually

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
worry too much about
differentiability.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:16.000
But, it's good,
at least, to be aware that you

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
can't always take the
derivative.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
So, yes, and what else do I
want to remind you of?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Well, they also have an
approximation formula -- --

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:39.000
which says that,
you know, if we have the value

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
of f at some point,
x0,

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:47.000
and that we want to find the
value at a nearby point,

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
x close to x0,
then our best guess is that

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:58.000
it's f of x0 plus the derivative
f prime at x0 times delta x,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
or if you want, x minus x0,
OK?

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Is this kind of familiar to you?
Yeah, I mean,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
maybe with different notations.
Maybe you called that delta x

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
or something.
Maybe you called that x0 plus h

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000
or something.
But, it's the usual

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
approximation formula using the
derivative.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
If you put more terms,
then you get the dreaded Taylor

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
approximation that I know you
guys don't like.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:36.000
So, the question is how do we
do the same for a function of

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:41.000
two variables,
f(x, y)?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000
So, the difficulty there is we
can change x,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
or we can change y,
or we can change both.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
And, presumably,
the manner in which f changes

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
will be different depending on
whether we change x or y.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
So, that's why we have several
different notions of derivative.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:37.000
So, OK, we have a notation.
OK, so this is a curly d,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
and it is not a straight d,
and it is not a delta.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
It's a d that kind of curves
backwards like that.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:50.000
And, this symbol is partial.
OK, so it's a special notation

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
for partial derivatives.
And, essentially what it means

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
is we are going to do a
derivative where we care about

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
only one variable at a time.
That's why it's partial.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
It's missing the other
variables.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
So, a function of several
variables doesn't have the usual

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
derivative.
It has only partial derivatives

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:15.000
for each variable.
So, the partial derivative,

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:23.000
the partial f partial x at (x0,
y0) is defined to be the limit

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:29.000
when I take a small change in x,
delta x,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:43.000
of the change in f -- --
divided by delta x.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
OK, so here I'm actually not
changing y at all.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:51.000
I'm just changing x and looking
at the rate of change with

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000
respect to x.
And, I have the same with

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
respect to y.
Partial f partial y is the

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:04.000
limit, so I should say,
at a point x0 y0 is the limit

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:13.000
as delta y turns to zero.
So, this time I keep x the

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:21.000
same, but I change y.
OK, so that's the definition of

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:26.000
a partial derivative.
And, we say that a function is

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:29.000
differentiable if these things
exist.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
OK, so most of the functions
we'll see are differentiable.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000
And, we'll actually learn how
to compute their partial

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
derivatives without having to do
this because we'll just have the

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000
usual methods for computing
derivatives.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
So, in fact,
I claim you already know how to

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
take partial derivatives.
So, let's see what it means

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
geometrically.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:07.000
So, geometrically,
my function can be represented

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000
by this graph,
and I fix some point,

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000
(x0, y0).
And then, I'm going to ask

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.000
myself what happens if I change
the value of,

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000
well, x, keeping y constant.
So, if I keep y constant and

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
change x, it means that I'm
moving forwards or backwards

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
parallel to the x axis.
So, that determines for me the

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:46.000
vertical plane parallel to the
x, z plane when I fix y equals

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
constant.
And now, if I slice the graph

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:59.000
by that, I will get some curve
that goes, it's a slice of the

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
graph of f.
And now, what I want to find is

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
how f depends on x if I keep y
constant.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
That means it's the rate of
change if I move along this

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000
curve.
So, in fact,

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
if I look at the slope of this
thing.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000
So, if I draw the tangent line
to this slice,

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
then the slope will be partial
f of partial x.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
I think I have a better picture
of that somewhere.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Yes, here it is.
OK, that's the same picture,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
just with different colors.
So, I take the graph.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
I slice it by a vertical plane.
I get the curve,

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
and now I take the slope of
that curve, and that gives me

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.000
the partial derivative.
And, to finish,

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:59.000
let me just tell you how,
and I should say,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
partial f partial y is the same
thing but slicing now by your

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:05.000
plane that goes in the y,
z directions.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:11.000
OK, so I fix x equals constant.
That means that I slice by a

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
plane that's parallel to the
blackboard.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
I get a curve,
and I looked at the slope of

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
that curve.
OK, so it's just a matter of

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
formatting one variable,
setting it constant,

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000
and looking at the other one.
So, how to compute these

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000
things, well,
we actually,

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
to find, well,
there's a piece of notation I

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
haven't told you yet.
So, another notation you will

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:42.000
see, I think this is what one
uses a lot in physics.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.000
And, this is what one uses a
lot in applied math,

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
which is the same thing as
physics but with different

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:50.000
notations.
OK, so it just too different

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
notations: partial f partial x,
or f subscript x.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:01.000
And, they are the same thing.
Well, we just treat y as a

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:10.000
constant, and x as a variable.
And, vice versa if we want to

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:16.000
find partial with aspect to y.
So, let me just finish with one

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000
quick example.
Let's say that they give you f

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:28.000
of x, y equals x^3y y^2,
then partial f partial x.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Well, let's take the derivative.
So, here it's x^3 times a

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
constant.
Derivative of x^3 is 3x^2 times

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:42.000
the constant plus what's the
derivative of y^2?

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Zero, because it's a constant.
If you do, instead,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
partial f partial y,
then this is actually a

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
constant times y.
The derivative of y is one.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000
So, that's just x^3.
And, the derivative of y^2 is

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
2y.
OK, so it's fairly easy.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.000
You just have to keep
remembering which one is a

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
variable, and which one isn't.
OK, so more about this next

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000
time, and we will also learn
about maxima and minima in

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000
several variables.

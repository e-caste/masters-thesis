00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:24.780
PROFESSOR: We've been talking
so far about basically

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.700
overviews of supply and demand
relationships and

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.670
understanding how
markets work.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.950
Now we're going to step back and
get behind the supply and

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.400
demand curves and understand
where those curves

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.520
themselves come from.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.490
So we talked about, given that
we have supply and demand

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.730
curves, how they interact.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.650
Now we're going to get behind
that and see where these

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.400
curves actually come from.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:48.550
Thank you, by the way
for coming down.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:49.800
I appreciate it.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.490
So what we're going to do is,
we're going to start with the

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.410
demand curve, and we're going to
spend the next few lectures

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.830
talking about consumers and how
consumer preferences are

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.555
ultimately what leads
to the construction

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:03.380
of the demand curve.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.200
Then after that and after the
first exam-- that will cover

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.250
what's on the first exam--

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.740
after the first exam, we'll
start talking about firms and

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.380
what determines the
firm supply curve.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.210
So today we'll talk about
consumers and we're going to

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.580
talk about where the demand
curve comes from.

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.810
And where it comes from, and
where all consumer behavior

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.665
coming from in economics is
from utility maximization.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.980
That's where everything with
consumers starts is with

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.790
utility maximization.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.030
That's the basic building block
of consumer behavior.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.050
And basically, utility
maximization--

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.330
that's what this lecture will
be about, describing it.

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.410
But basically, an overview
is, we posit some type of

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:56.870
preferences.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:03.070
We posit consumer preferences,
what consumers would like.

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:10.370
We posit some budget constraint,
what resources

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:12.980
consumers have to get
what they'd like.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.360
And then we do a constrained
maximization problem that

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.500
says, given your preferences,
given what you'd like, subject

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.840
to the resources you have
available, what

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.870
choices will you make?

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.710
And in particular, we're going
to ask, the term we'll use is

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.860
we'll ask what bundle of goods
makes you the best off?

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.020
Given your preference, given
your constraints,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.510
what bundle of goods?

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.050
So think about consumers
choosing

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.160
across a set of goods.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.390
Typically, we'll think about two
goods because graphs are

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.760
easier to think about two
dimensions than more.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.230
So we'll typically think about
trading off two goods.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.140
So think about consumers with
preferences across two goods,

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.880
some budget they can
allocate, and how

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.080
they make those choices.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.170
But this basic framework applies
to the multiplicity of

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.790
choices we all make along
many, many dimensions.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.380
So doing two dimensions as one
of the simplifying assumptions

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.560
I'll talk about.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.590
But that's just a simplifying
assumption.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.930
So basically what we we're going
to do is we're going to

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.180
go through this in three
steps, not just in this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.740
lecture, but over the
next few lectures.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.600
Step one, is we're going to talk
about what assumptions we

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.300
make about preferences.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.235
So I'll talk today about
preference assumptions.

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.320
So the axioms that underlie how
economists model consumer

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.600
preferences.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.840
We'll then talk about how we
translate these preferences

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.770
assumptions into mathematical
tractability through the use

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.570
of the utility function, which
is basically a mathematical

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.690
representation of underlying
consumer preferences.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.660
So we'll talk about how we
basically take these

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.560
preferences and translate them
into something that we can

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.440
work with here at MIT by making
it mathematical, by

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.420
making a utility function.

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.560
And then finally, we'll talk
about budget constraints.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.360
And armed with these three
things, we'll then be able to

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.610
model how consumers
make decisions.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:18.120
Now, importantly for today's
lecture, we are not dealing

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.420
with budget constraints.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.690
So this is not happening
today.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.280
So today we're not going to
worry about the budget

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.530
constraints.

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.325
Today we're in a world where
we're just going to talk about

00:04:26.325 --> 00:04:28.590
what people want and we're going
to put out of our mind

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.140
whether or not they
can afford it.

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:32.690
So just talk about people want,
and we'll put out of

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.200
mind for today.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.440
We'll come back next time to
whether they can afford it.

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.910
We're just going to think
about unconstrained

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.810
preferences for today's
lecture.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:47.310
So let's talk about our
preference assumptions.

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:53.180
So, to model consumers'
preferences across goods,

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.360
we're going to impose three
preference assumptions.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:05.160
Three preference assumptions.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.260
Assumption one--

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.990
now once again, let me remind
you from the first lecture,

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.260
this is getting to some of
the harder material.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.320
I'm going to write messily and
talk quickly, so stop me if

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.520
anything is unclear.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.450
And if you don't stop me, I'll
just go faster and faster

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:19.860
until I explode.

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.190
So basically, feel free to
interrupt and stop me with

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.260
questions and such.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.400
Three assumptions
on preferences.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.800
The first assumption
is completeness.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.140
The first assumption is the
assumption of completeness.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.910
When comparing two bundles of
goods, you prefer one or the

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.180
other, but you don't
value them equally.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.720
OK when comparing two bundles
of goods, you prefer one or

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.870
you prefer the other, but
you're not indifferent.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.860
Completeness is the same
as no indifference.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.230
So what we're saying is whenever
I offer you two

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:56.170
bundles of goods, you
could always tell me

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:57.090
what you like better.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.490
Now it could be infinitesimally
better.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.440
I'm not saying you have to
have strong preferences.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.330
But you cannot say
I'm indifferent.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.680
You can never be purely
indifferent.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.390
There always at least some
slight preference for one

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:11.090
bundle of goods over another.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.340
That's the completeness
assumption.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:14.800
This is an assumption we make.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.640
Now in reality, oftentimes
we are indifferent.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.900
Well once again, this is one
of these simplifying

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.650
assumptions that will
make the model work.

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.200
And in fact, in reality if
forced, you can always decide

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.910
whether you like one thing
better than another, we just

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.440
often follow heuristic rules
which say we're roughly

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.250
indifferent.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.640
We're just going to say, more
precisely, you are never

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.300
purely indifferent.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.100
So, I'm not sure is
not an option.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.900
You can never say I don't know,
I don't know which I

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.470
prefer, I'm indifferent.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.450
I'm sorry, let me back up.

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:41.780
I'm using the wrong word.

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:43.416
Forget I said indifferent,
because we'll want to use that

00:06:43.416 --> 00:06:44.690
word in a different
context later.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.470
You can't say, I'm not sure.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.010
You can't say, I'm not sure.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.580
You can't say, I'm not sure,
can't say I don't know, I

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.830
don't know how I feel
about that.

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:05.250
Scratch what I said a few
minutes ago, because I want to

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.460
use indifference differently.

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:08.810
Completeness is not about not
being different, we're going

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.490
to use that.

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.510
What I'm saying is it's
about not being sure.

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:14.480
You've got to value every
bundle of goods.

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.720
You've got to be willing to
value every bundle of goods

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.610
that's given you.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.500
So you can't say that I don't
know, I don't know how I feel

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.110
about that.

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.570
You've got to have some
feeling about stuff.

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.880
You can't say I'm not sure.

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.810
You've got to have a complete
set of preferences over all

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:28.680
bundles of goods that
are given you.

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.910
OK, that's completeness.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.640
The second is transitivity.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:39.930
Which is something we've been
learning since kindergarten

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:41.000
about transitivity, right?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.570
And also, it's a different
context.

00:07:42.570 --> 00:07:45.020
That's just if you prefer x to
y, and y to z, you've got to

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.140
prefer x to z.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.650
OK, you guys should
do transitivity in

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.010
your sleep by now.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:50.970
OK, so the standard transitivity
we always assume

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.870
in math class, we're going
to assume here as well.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.800
OK, that should be pretty
noncontroversial.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:01.400
OK, and then finally, and
probably most controversial,

00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.990
is we're going to assume
non-satiation.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.520
Or the famous economic
assumption that

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.120
more is always better.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.260
OK.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.400
More is always better, that is,
you never would turn down

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.000
having more.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.950
Now we're going to talk later
today and tomorrow about why

00:08:21.950 --> 00:08:24.490
you might not like the next unit
as much as you like the

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.530
current unit.

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:28.270
But you'll always like
it greater than zero.

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:30.640
You're always happy
to have more.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.799
You never say, I've had enough,
I literally value at

00:08:32.799 --> 00:08:34.230
zero the next unit.

00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:37.070
You may value it as epsilon, but
you'll always value it as

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.289
greater than zero.

00:08:38.289 --> 00:08:40.130
That's the non-satiation
assumption,

00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:41.230
more is always better.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.259
Now, this is the most
controversial.

00:08:42.259 --> 00:08:43.840
And obviously we can think
of many contexts in

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.750
which that's not true.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.170
But if we don't allow for this
assumption, the modeling gets

00:08:49.170 --> 00:08:50.120
a lot trickier.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.350
So once again, let's put
it out of our mind.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:54.910
Realistically, we know once
we've eaten a certain amount,

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.060
we literally do not
want any more.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.680
OK, so we're going to
put that aside.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.480
Assume we're always in a space
where we can always eat a

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.240
little bit more.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.540
OK, we'll call it the
Jewish mother space.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:06.670
OK, you can always eat
a little bit more.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.430
OK, you can always eat
a little bit more.

00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:10.620
We're just going to assume we're
in that space for now.

00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.220
OK.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.360
And so, for large ranges,
we can see it is not an

00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:14.170
unreasonable assumption.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:15.800
Although, I think in extremes,
you could see this becomes

00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.320
unreasonable.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.090
OK, so those are assumptions.

00:09:19.090 --> 00:09:20.520
Completeness, which once
again, I screwed up in

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.360
describing.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.900
Come back to the second way I
described it, which means you

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:23.740
can't say you're not sure.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.970
You always have preferences
over things.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.390
That doesn't seem
unreasonable.

00:09:27.390 --> 00:09:29.360
Transitivity which we've been
living with since we were

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.070
kindergartners.

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.410
And non-satiation, which could
be a little controversial, but

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.820
we'll live with it for now.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:37.570
Now given these, we're going to
talk about the properties

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.820
of what we call indifference
curves.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.450
This is why I screwed
up before.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.080
Of course you can be indifferent
between things.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.990
That's the whole point
of economics.

00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:47.706
I don't know why I
got that wrong.

00:09:47.706 --> 00:09:50.160
I haven't taught this course
about six years, so I lost

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.130
track of things.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:54.170
Properties of indifference
curves.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:59.080
So indifference curves are our
name for what you could also

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:02.325
think of as preference maps.

00:10:02.325 --> 00:10:05.160
In economics, we like to be able
to describe everything,

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.600
as I said, three ways,
intuitively, graphically, and

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.590
mathematically.

00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:12.320
Preference maps are the
graphical representation of

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.950
people's preferences which we
do through graphics that we

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:17.130
call indifference curves.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:19.421
So now let's go to the example
I'm going to use that I'm

00:10:19.421 --> 00:10:21.680
going to use throughout these
next couple lectures of a

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.470
decision you have to make.

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:26.330
Now I tried to think of a cool
way to make this example cool,

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:26.920
and I just couldn't.

00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.630
So its going to be
a boring example.

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:31.400
It's going to be, imagine your
parents gave you some money

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.760
and you had to decide whether
to buy pizza or see movies.

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.340
I tried to make it at least a
little bit relevant even if I

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.760
couldn't make it cool.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.950
You've got to decide whether
to buy pizza or see movies.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:41.110
That's your decision.

00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:42.570
That's the trade-off
you're making.

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:47.150
We're in a world with only two
goods, pizza and movies.

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:49.930
And you're deciding how to
allocate the money your

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.210
parents gave you over
pizza and movies.

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.410
Now let's say we're going to
consider three choices of

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:00.490
pizza and movies.

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:01.740
So go to figure 4-1a.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:10.140
We're going to consider, you
could have two pizzas and one

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:15.530
movie, that's point A. You could
have one pizza and two

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:18.030
movies, that's point B. Or you
can have two of both, that's

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:21.500
point C. That's just three
choices you're facing.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.140
Once again, we're ignoring
paying for them.

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:24.860
Budget constraints
is next time.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:26.950
Now we're just saying I'm giving
these three choices.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:29.210
Well how do you feel
about them?

00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:32.010
Well let's assume that
you're indifferent--

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:32.970
and this is why you can
be indifferent.

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:35.070
What I said before,
just strike.

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:37.000
Let's say you're indifferent
between two pizzas and one

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.150
movie, and one pizza
and two movies.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:43.730
Let's say, if you had two pizzas
and one movie, or one

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:45.350
pizza and two movies, you pretty
much feel the same

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:46.360
about them.

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:50.880
But clearly you like two pizzas
and two movies better

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:54.200
than either of the first
two combinations.

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:57.000
Then what we can do is we
can draw what we call

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.510
indifference curves.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.820
And that's in figure 4-1b.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:04.330
These are maps of your
preferences.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:09.060
An indifference curve is the
curve showing all combinations

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:13.050
of consumption along which the
individual is indifferent.

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:14.600
And I'll say that again,
very important concept.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.970
An indifference curve is a curve
showing all combinations

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:22.490
of consumption along which an
individual is indifferent.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:23.800
So you have an indifference
curve.

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.810
I said you were indifferent
between A and B. So you have

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:30.370
an indifference curve that runs
between A and B. That

00:12:30.370 --> 00:12:33.400
means that all, and I'm assuming
that all combinations

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.670
along this curve, you're
indifferent.

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:37.850
So you're equally happy getting
two pizzas and one

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:39.820
movie or one pizza
and two movies.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:44.566
But point C, which is two pizzas
and two movies is on a

00:12:44.566 --> 00:12:45.530
different indifference curve.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:50.120
You're not indifferent between
point C and points A and B.

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.340
You're indifferent
between A and B--

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:53.210
I'm just assuming this, I'm
not saying you are.

00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.050
But I'm just assuming, let's
imagine you are.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:01.010
But you clearly like two pizzas
and two movies better

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:03.430
than one of one and
two of the other.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:03.927
Yeah?

00:13:03.927 --> 00:13:07.406
AUDIENCE: Does that break the
completeness rule for the--

00:13:07.406 --> 00:13:09.160
PROFESSOR: Does that break it?

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.120
Why would that break it?

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:11.411
AUDIENCE: Do you prefer
pizza over movies

00:13:11.411 --> 00:13:12.470
or movies over pizza?

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:13.460
PROFESSOR: No.

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:14.740
Because this is my
screw up before.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:16.600
Completeness just means you
know how you feel about

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.090
everything.

00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:22.110
So strike from the record
my initial description.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:24.030
Completeness means you just
know how you feel about

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:24.620
everything.

00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:25.960
You're allowed to
be indifferent.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.416
Completeness just means you
can't say, I don't know, I

00:13:27.416 --> 00:13:28.690
don't know how I feel
about pizza.

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.740
You've got to have feelings
for pizza.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:31.260
OK.

00:13:31.260 --> 00:13:32.490
You've got to know how
you feel about stuff.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.750
That's what completeness is.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:40.780
So armed with those assumptions,
there are four

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:43.530
key properties of indifference
curves that we have

00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:44.700
to keep track of.

00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:48.010
Four key properties of
indifference curves.

00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:51.770
The first is that consumers
prefer higher

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:53.440
indifference curves.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:58.410
So you prefer higher
indifference curves.

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.620
Prefer higher indifference
curves.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:05.290
What I mean by that is, the
further out the indifference

00:14:05.290 --> 00:14:06.920
curve, the more you prefer it.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.060
And this comes naturally from
the non-satiation assumption.

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.340
Given that we've assumed
non-satiation, you must always

00:14:14.340 --> 00:14:16.690
prefer an indifference curve
that's further from the origin

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:19.770
because it's more, and
more is better.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.960
OK so given non-satiation,
you will always prefer an

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.100
indifference curves that are
further from the origin.

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:29.000
That follows directly
from non-satiation.

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:39.750
The second point is that
indifference curves are always

00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.000
downward sloping.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.705
Indifference curves are always
downward sloping.

00:14:51.994 --> 00:14:54.050
Indifference curves are always
downward sloping.

00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:56.160
And that, once again, comes
from non-satiation.

00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.040
To see this, let's look at the
next figure, an upward sloping

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.020
indifference curve.

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.320
Why does an upward sloping
indifference curve, someone

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.529
tell me, violate
non-satiation.

00:15:07.529 --> 00:15:08.002
Yeah?

00:15:08.002 --> 00:15:10.367
AUDIENCE: Because you're
indifferent to getting more.

00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:10.681
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:15:10.681 --> 00:15:11.850
Because this would say
you're indifferent

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:13.480
between (1,1) and (2,2).

00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.770
It's not quite drawn right.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:18.010
We ought to just have this go
through to point (2,2).

00:15:18.010 --> 00:15:20.710
But basically, this would say
you're indifferent between

00:15:20.710 --> 00:15:22.610
getting one pizza and
one movie or two

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:23.870
pizzas and two movies.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.880
You can't be because that
violates more is better.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.710
So indifference curves can't be
upward sloping, they've got

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:33.510
to be downward sloping by the
non-satiation assumption.

00:15:33.510 --> 00:15:37.890
OK, that's the second property
of indifference curves.

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:40.730
The third property of
indifference curves is

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:42.530
indifference curves
cannot cross.

00:15:46.150 --> 00:15:50.080
Indifference curves
cannot cross.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.910
Why can't indifference
curves cross?

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:54.405
Well here I forgot to have
Jessica do a pretty diagram,

00:15:54.405 --> 00:15:57.840
so you'll have to deal with
my ugly handwriting here.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.720
So why can't indifferent
curves cross?

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.820
Well imagine a situation
where you have your

00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.230
pizza and your movies.

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:11.690
And imagine a situation where
you have one indifference

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.150
curve that looks like this,
and one indifference curve

00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.840
that looks like this.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.480
OK, two indifference curves.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:25.570
And you've got, let's label
these points A, B, and C.

00:16:25.570 --> 00:16:28.810
Now could someone give me, based
on the properties of

00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:31.405
indifference curves that we
talked about over here, given

00:16:31.405 --> 00:16:33.030
these three properties,
can someone tell me

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:35.440
why this is a violation?

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:35.845
Yeah?

00:16:35.845 --> 00:16:38.628
AUDIENCE: Because A and B are
on the same curve, meaning

00:16:38.628 --> 00:16:41.405
you're indifferent between A and
B. A and C are also on the

00:16:41.405 --> 00:16:43.990
same curve because you're
indifferent between the two.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.693
But that means you're also
indifferent between B and C

00:16:46.693 --> 00:16:48.426
which can't be true because
more is better.

00:16:48.426 --> 00:16:49.490
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.050
So transitivity says I must then
be indifferent between B

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.200
and C through the logic
you just laid out.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.090
But I can't be indifferent
between B and C because B

00:16:56.090 --> 00:17:00.390
dominates C. B has a basically
the same number of movies, but

00:17:00.390 --> 00:17:03.040
more pizza, so I must
like B better.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.810
So by the combination of
transitivity and non-satiation

00:17:06.810 --> 00:17:09.930
indifference curves
can't cross.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.269
And finally, completeness, which
is the most awkward of

00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:15.770
these assumptions, it simply
means you can't have more than

00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:18.930
one indifference curve
through a point.

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:24.790
So basically, the idea of every
possible bundle has one

00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:25.730
indifference curve.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:27.399
You can't have two indifference
curves through it

00:17:27.399 --> 00:17:29.250
sayin, I'm not sure which
indifference curve I'm on.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:30.650
I'm not sure how I
feel about this.

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:31.560
You know how you feel.

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:34.120
There's one indifference curve
through every bundle.

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:37.150
There's not two indifference
curves through a bundle.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:40.800
So this is the way we think
about preference maps which is

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.350
the sort of core building
block of utility theory.

00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:48.960
Now I was an undergrad here,
took this course, but I never

00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:51.820
really understood indifference
curves until I had a year off

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.900
with a grad student who was
trying to decide where to take

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.672
a job and he did it through
just showing me an

00:17:57.672 --> 00:17:58.900
indifference map.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.680
He said look, I'm trying to
decide where to take a job,

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:01.600
and I care about two things.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.730
I care about how good the place
is and where it is.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:09.230
So he said here, he had
location and he

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:10.870
had academic rank.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:21.060
And he said look, I'm
indifferent between Princeton

00:18:21.060 --> 00:18:26.130
which has a shitty location but
a wonderful academic rank.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:28.680
I'm from New Jersey, but it's
still a shitty location.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:32.240
OK, and Santa Cruz.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:37.130
And Santa Cruz which has not
such a good academic

00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.250
reputation, but a pretty
awesome location.

00:18:39.250 --> 00:18:42.680
And he said here's my
indifference map.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.810
And where did he end up going?

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:47.730
He ended up going to the IMF,
the international monetary

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.970
fund in DC which had a better
location than Princeton--

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:54.075
worse than Santa Cruz, but a
better reputation than Santa

00:18:54.075 --> 00:18:55.640
Cruz and worse than Princeton.

00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:57.710
So he decided he was indifferent
along this map,

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:00.180
and he ended up choosing
a point in the middle.

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.700
But indifference curves are just
a way of representing two

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:05.090
dimensional choices.

00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.110
Now very few choice in life are
really two dimensional,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.100
but that's a nice example.

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:08.865
Question in the back?

00:19:08.865 --> 00:19:12.590
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
IMF, the point would be

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:14.825
actually not on the curve,
but further out?

00:19:14.825 --> 00:19:15.719
PROFESSOR: If it were
further out.

00:19:15.719 --> 00:19:17.225
A great question.

00:19:17.225 --> 00:19:18.740
So imagine if IMF were here.

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:24.054
What should he have done?

00:19:24.054 --> 00:19:25.380
Definitely go to IMF.

00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:26.700
Here he was indifferent.

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.560
He could flip a coin and be
equally happy at all three.

00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:31.610
But if IMF were out here, and
maybe it was because that's

00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.520
what he chose.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:33.120
That's a good point.

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.440
I don't know if IMF
was here or here.

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.380
The fact that he chose
IMF, it can reveal it

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.390
wasn't anywhere in here.

00:19:40.390 --> 00:19:41.760
It's a very good
point actually.

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:44.510
It can reveal it wasn't
anywhere in here.

00:19:44.510 --> 00:19:45.510
That we know.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:47.420
But I can't tell if it
was on the curve

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:49.030
or outside the curve.

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:49.890
It could have been on the
curve because he's

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:51.720
indifferent, so who knows, he
could have flipped the coin.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.470
Or it could have been outside
the curve because it's better.

00:19:53.470 --> 00:19:54.360
We can't tell that.

00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.220
That's a good point.

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:57.110
All right.

00:19:57.110 --> 00:19:58.590
So that's a preference map.

00:19:58.590 --> 00:20:00.950
That's indifference curves.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:03.890
Now let's step from indifference
curves, which is

00:20:03.890 --> 00:20:07.935
a building block of preferences,
to utility.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:15.180
Now everything you need to
know about preferences is

00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:17.920
represented in those
indifference maps.

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:21.630
The problem is they're pretty
awkward to work with when we

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:25.990
need to actually prove theorems
and solve and

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:27.880
understand how people
make decisions.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.060
That's a lot easier if we have
a mathematical representation

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.540
of those preference maps.

00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:35.280
And that's the utility
function

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.200
So the utility function is a
mathematical representation of

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:40.770
preferences.

00:20:40.770 --> 00:20:41.950
That's all it is.

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:45.415
You're going to be hearing this
term in your nightmares

00:20:45.415 --> 00:20:46.910
for the next semester.

00:20:46.910 --> 00:20:48.060
Utility functions.

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:51.520
But remember, it's just a
mathematical representation of

00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:52.950
people's underlying
preferences.

00:20:52.950 --> 00:20:55.890
Don't be scared of it.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.450
And the key thing is that we
assume individuals have these

00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.820
well-defined utility functions,
and by maximizing

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.840
those utility functions we can
tell what choices they're

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.060
going to make.

00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.120
So for example, suppose that
I said that your utility

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:13.660
function over pizza and movies
was the square root of pizza

00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:16.390
times movies.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.360
That's a utility function.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.270
I'm going to say, what the
hell does that mean?

00:21:18.270 --> 00:21:19.570
Well, it doesn't mean anything,

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.820
it's a utility function.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:21.900
It's your preferences.

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.280
It's a mathematical
representation of your

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.530
preferences.

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.730
What does that mean?

00:21:27.730 --> 00:21:29.440
What it means is--

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.290
it doesn't mean anything
inherently, but it tells us

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:33.960
about your preferences.

00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.880
What it tells us is that
your preferences can be

00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.450
represented.

00:21:38.450 --> 00:21:43.030
If you flip back to figure 4-1b,
it tells us those are

00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:47.350
your preferences because you're
indifferent between two

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.390
pizzas and one movie and one
pizza and two movies.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.890
Of course you're indifferent.

00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:53.860
They both give a utility
square root two.

00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.265
But you prefer two pizzas and
two movies because that gives

00:21:56.265 --> 00:21:58.140
a utility of two.

00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:00.650
So this is a mathematical
representation consistent with

00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:02.110
those utility indifference
curves.

00:22:02.110 --> 00:22:03.540
Not the only one.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:04.910
There's other mathematical
representations that could be

00:22:04.910 --> 00:22:06.750
consistent with those
indifference curves.

00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.760
But let's posit that this is
your utility function.

00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.260
This is a mathematical
representation of your tastes.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.120
Now what does utility mean?

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:20.040
Utility means nothing in the
sense that it is not a

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.035
cardinal concept.

00:22:21.035 --> 00:22:23.690
It's only an ordinal concept.

00:22:23.690 --> 00:22:30.110
So if I say to you that you get
two utils from two pizzas

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:32.290
and two movies, that doesn't
mean anything.

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:35.450
It just means that you get
more than from one

00:22:35.450 --> 00:22:36.420
pizza and one movie.

00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:39.080
And we can even get the ratio
that you get square root of

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:43.320
two more, than you get from
one pizza and two movies.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.340
We can do ranking and
ordinality, but we can't

00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:47.560
assign cardinality.

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:52.260
I can't say how happy you are
in some abstract absolute

00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.120
sense from two pizzas
and one movie.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.270
I can't give a cardinal
form preference.

00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:58.150
But this is an ordinal ranking
of preferences.

00:22:58.150 --> 00:23:01.130
I can tell what you like
better than what else.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.192
That's why utility function
is a representation of

00:23:03.192 --> 00:23:04.400
indifference maps.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.340
They're just a mathematical tool
for comparing bundles,

00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.710
they're not some inner answer
to the value of your soul or

00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:11.250
something like that.

00:23:11.250 --> 00:23:12.660
Don't imbue these with
too much magic.

00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:15.050
They're just mathematical ways
of representing preferences.

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:22.530
The key concept, the single most
important concept, for

00:23:22.530 --> 00:23:25.170
consumer theory for
understanding how consumers

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:28.245
make decisions is the concept
of marginal utility.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:35.150
We'll talk a lot this semester
about marginal this and

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:36.560
marginal that.

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.220
And this is our first example.

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.840
Marginal utility.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:45.740
That is how your utility changes
with each additional

00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.390
unit of the good, or
the derivative

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:49.150
of the utility function.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:51.025
If you want to do it in calculus
terms, marginal

00:23:51.025 --> 00:23:52.790
utility is the derivative of
your utility function with

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:55.080
respect to one of the inputs.

00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:57.490
But if you don't want to put it
in calculus terms, it's as

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.040
you add each unit of one of the
elements of the utility

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.130
function, how does
utility change

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:08.380
So to see this, let's do an
example of marginal utility.

00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:13.330
Imagine for a moment that you
have two pizzas, p equals two.

00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:14.730
You've got two pizzas,
they're there.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.660
Your roommate's got
them or something.

00:24:16.660 --> 00:24:20.910
OK, now I want to ask, how does
your utility change as

00:24:20.910 --> 00:24:23.060
you see additional movies?

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:25.060
And to show that, let's
look at figure

00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:28.310
4-3 which isn't here.

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:29.410
Whoops.

00:24:29.410 --> 00:24:30.982
There's no figure 4-3.

00:24:30.982 --> 00:24:32.100
Do you got that figure 4-3?

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:33.865
AUDIENCE: There was never
any figure 4-3.

00:24:33.865 --> 00:24:37.310
PROFESSOR: There was never
any figure 4-3.

00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.620
So let's go to 4-5.

00:24:43.370 --> 00:24:43.933
So basically--

00:24:43.933 --> 00:24:46.588
AUDIENCE: Figure 4-4?

00:24:46.588 --> 00:24:47.838
PROFESSOR: No but--

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.110
actually fine.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:53.620
4-4.

00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.460
So basically what this is
showing, what figure 4-4 is

00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:00.010
showing, is it showing how--

00:25:00.010 --> 00:25:01.970
no actually, let's go to 4-5.

00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:02.910
They're out of order.

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:04.120
Let's go to 4-5.

00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.420
What 4-5 is showing--

00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:07.780
no, that's not going to work.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:09.540
OK, back to 4-4.

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:14.600
What figure 4-4 is showing, is
it's showing how your marginal

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:18.650
utility for movies evolves, how
your utility evolves as

00:25:18.650 --> 00:25:20.590
you get more movies.

00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:24.370
Given that you have two pizzas,
this is the evolution

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:28.440
of your utility as you
get more movies.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.900
So each additional movie
increases your utility.

00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:33.390
The slope is positive.

00:25:33.390 --> 00:25:35.610
By more is better,
we know that.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:40.420
Even if it's some date
movie, it still

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.510
improves your utility.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:46.590
So it still improves your
utility, but at

00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:48.010
a diminishing rate.

00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:50.910
And that's the key
is that we assume

00:25:50.910 --> 00:25:58.020
diminishing marginal utility.

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:00.550
The key assumption underlies
everything we'll do for

00:26:00.550 --> 00:26:05.110
consumers is diminishing
marginal utility.

00:26:05.110 --> 00:26:09.190
We assume that additional movie
increases your utility,

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:13.430
but at an ever diminishing
rate.

00:26:13.430 --> 00:26:19.670
So basically, we can actually
graph your margins.

00:26:19.670 --> 00:26:22.970
And that's what figure
4-5 is, is a graph of

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:24.220
your marginal utility.

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:38.080
So basically, when you have
two pizzas and one movie,

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.720
utility is square root
of 2, right?

00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.860
Now what I'm saying is if you
get one more movie, your

00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:49.120
utility is going to rise from
square root of 2 to 2.

00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.262
So the marginal utility
of that next movie --

00:26:53.262 --> 00:26:54.711
is that right?

00:26:54.711 --> 00:26:56.160
Two movies.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.740
1.4.

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.840
Yeah, it's going to rise by
the square root of 2.

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.746
You're going to multiply your
utility by the square root of

00:27:03.746 --> 00:27:05.110
two, so your marginal
utility--

00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:08.140
you're going to go from the
utility of square root of 2 to

00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:09.580
utility of two.

00:27:09.580 --> 00:27:11.730
So utility is going
to increase by the

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.170
square root of 2.

00:27:14.170 --> 00:27:15.400
Utility is going to increase--

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.681
I'm doing this wrong, hold on.

00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:21.370
One second.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.030
From one movie.

00:27:25.030 --> 00:27:25.520
I see.

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:25.850
I see.

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.650
So, I'm sorry.

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.710
This isn't the delta, this is
the level of marginal utility.

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:30.010
So I'm graphing the actual level
of marginal utility.

00:27:30.010 --> 00:27:30.700
Back up.

00:27:30.700 --> 00:27:33.115
OK, so I'm graphing the actual
level of marginal utility.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.880
So when you have two pizzas and
one movie, your marginal

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:44.730
utility, your actual utility--

00:27:44.730 --> 00:27:46.020
I see, that's what this is.

00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.480
This is the actual utility
I'm graphing.

00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.270
So I told you a minute ago, we
can't measure utility as a

00:27:49.270 --> 00:27:52.290
cardinal concept, but actually
here I'm doing it anyway

00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.190
because it's to illustrate
marginal utility.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:56.120
So your utility, OK.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:01.250
When you have one movie is
1.4, square root of 2.

00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.990
That's your utility.

00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:10.720
Now when you move from one movie
to a second movie, your

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:13.320
utility goes up from square
root of 2 to 2.

00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:15.700
Your utility goes up by 0.6.

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:19.560
So the marginal utility of
that second movie is 0.6.

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.680
Utility was 1.4, was
a square root of 2.

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.930
Now it's increased to 2.

00:28:25.930 --> 00:28:28.480
So the marginal utility of
the first movie is 0.6.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.390
Now let's say you add another
movie, you go to three movies.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:32.190
What's your utility now?

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:34.280
It's the square root of 6.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.020
So it's gone from 4,
to the square root

00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.070
of 6, which is 2.45.

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:44.380
So your marginal utility of
the third movie is 0.45.

00:28:44.380 --> 00:28:46.850
This graph is messed up because
the first one is an

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:48.450
actual utility level.

00:28:48.450 --> 00:28:49.873
So the first one I say,
for one movie, you

00:28:49.873 --> 00:28:51.630
have a utility 1.4.

00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:54.260
And then for the second movie,
I give the marginal utility,

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.800
the third movie marginal
utility.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.950
So, this graph sort of-- yeah?

00:28:56.950 --> 00:28:59.720
AUDIENCE: It shows the marginal
utility of the very

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.499
first movie.

00:29:00.499 --> 00:29:04.500
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I guess
that's right

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.200
because you're zero.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.390
You're zero movies.

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:07.100
OK, right.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:07.410
You're right.

00:29:07.410 --> 00:29:08.820
OK, so the first one is the
marginal utility of the very

00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.980
first movie, you're right.

00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.380
So the very first movie gives
you marginal utility of 1.4

00:29:12.380 --> 00:29:13.840
because you go from 0
to square root of 2.

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.420
That's right.

00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:15.490
My bad.

00:29:15.490 --> 00:29:17.610
So you go from 0 to square root
of 2 to get a marginal

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:20.473
utility of 1.4 for the first
movie From square root of 2 to

00:29:20.473 --> 00:29:23.550
2, you get 0.6 the next movie.

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:25.436
From 2 to square root
of 6, you get 0.45

00:29:25.436 --> 00:29:26.950
for the third movie.

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:29.950
For square root of 6 to square
root of 8, you only get 0.38

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:31.930
from the fourth movie,
and so on.

00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:35.270
So the key point is that these
marginal utilities are ever

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:36.990
decreasing.

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:42.790
Each additional movie gives you
less incremental utility.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:44.385
And if you stop and
think about it,

00:29:44.385 --> 00:29:45.720
it's kind of intuitive.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.620
Just stop and think, think about
the movies you want to

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:49.230
see right now.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:50.530
The four movies you
want to see.

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:53.970
Presumably whichever you ranked
first would give you

00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.320
more utility to see than
whichever you ranked second.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.860
And if you think the movies
that are out right now are

00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.930
pretty crappy like I do, by the
time you get to the fourth

00:30:00.930 --> 00:30:04.740
movie, you're not getting much
utility from it at all.

00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.620
Thinking about movies that are
out now, you're getting a lot

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:08.650
of utility from that first
movie you see.

00:30:08.650 --> 00:30:11.040
Marginal, extra utility from
the first movie you see.

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.200
But each additional one is
giving you less and less.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.920
And that's the idea of
diminishing marginal utility.

00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.370
Likewise with pizzas, if you
haven't eaten all day, that

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.050
first pizza can give you a very
high marginal utility.

00:30:21.050 --> 00:30:23.950
The enjoyment you get from
eating that first pizza can be

00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:25.890
very large.

00:30:25.890 --> 00:30:27.990
But the second pizza,
not so much.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.240
You're already pretty full.

00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:29.840
Third pizza, even less.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.660
And then fourth pizza would
probably violate

00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:34.030
non-satiation.

00:30:34.030 --> 00:30:35.000
So that's the basic idea.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:35.400
Yeah?

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:37.276
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:30:37.276 --> 00:30:40.090
Do we assume that the goods
are homogeneous.

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.910
Is it the same movie
watched four times?

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:45.016
Or different movies?

00:30:45.016 --> 00:30:47.180
PROFESSOR: Actually, that's
a great question.

00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.450
And you have to specify that
as part of the problem.

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.695
I haven't specified that here.

00:30:52.695 --> 00:30:54.710
Obviously it can't be the same
pizza eaten four times.

00:30:54.710 --> 00:30:58.060
It could be the same kind of
pizza eaten four times.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:03.340
But do you see the same movie?

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.940
I haven't specified that here.

00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.615
So there's not a general
assumption about that.

00:31:06.615 --> 00:31:08.775
It depends on how
I define movies.

00:31:08.775 --> 00:31:12.870
Did I define movies as--

00:31:12.870 --> 00:31:13.630
I don't know.

00:31:13.630 --> 00:31:14.170
God, I'm terrible.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:15.990
All I know that's out now is
the Guardians of G'ahoole

00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.290
because I've got a little kid
who is interested in it.

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:18.330
Whatever movie's out.

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:20.765
Do I define movies as Guardians
of G'ahoole, or do I

00:31:20.765 --> 00:31:23.050
define movies as
seeing a movie?

00:31:23.050 --> 00:31:24.340
And I didn't specify that.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.960
Implicit in my examples,
I specify

00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.980
movies as seeing a movie.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.660
But you have to specify that to
be more precise if you're

00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.510
actually trying to
figure out--

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.330
it depends what you're
maximizing over.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.270
If you're maximizing over seeing
any movie or maximize

00:31:36.270 --> 00:31:37.970
over seeing the same movie.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.220
And I didn't specify here.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:40.080
AUDIENCE: It can work
in both cases.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.830
PROFESSOR: It would work
in both cases.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.590
Clearly you could imagine,
actually it's a very good

00:31:43.590 --> 00:31:45.530
point, where do you think your
marginal utility would

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:47.590
diminish more?

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.940
Seeing the same movie.

00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:52.530
So what your example points out
is that different goods

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.830
will have different rates of
diminishing marginal utility.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:59.680
OK, so marginal utility will
always be diminishing, but at

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:02.500
very different rates for
different goods.

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.110
So the general principle is
that they'll be generally

00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:07.370
diminishing marginal utility.

00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:09.530
But at different rates
for different goods.

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:13.390
So after all my mess ups,
let me just review.

00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.430
Marginal utility is diminishing
because each good

00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:16.380
is worth less to you.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:20.240
It's always positive because
of non-satiation.

00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:24.140
And this graph represents the
marginal utility you get from

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:28.610
each movie you see conditional
on having eaten two pizzas.

00:32:28.610 --> 00:32:30.450
Marginal utility is
the increment from

00:32:30.450 --> 00:32:33.200
the next unit consumed.

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.750
Now let's get back
on track here.

00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:40.400
Now let's go to thinking
about--

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.890
now that we have this concept
of utility and marginal

00:32:43.890 --> 00:32:46.920
utility, let's now bring
utility back

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.570
to preference maps.

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:52.500
Let's ask, given what we know
about utility, what can this

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:55.720
teach us about the shape
of preference maps?

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.910
What's the linkage between
utility and preference maps?

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:05.700
And that linkage comes through
something we call the marginal

00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.950
rate of substitution.

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.270
The marginal rate of
substitution is the

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:16.950
mathematical concept that links
preference utility with

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:19.290
preference maps.

00:33:19.290 --> 00:33:22.680
The marginal rate of
substitution technically is

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.710
the slope of the indifference
curve.

00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:29.190
It's delta P over delta M. The
slope of the indifference

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:32.880
curve is the marginal rate
of substitution.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:35.930
That's what it means
graphically, but here's what

00:33:35.930 --> 00:33:39.120
you have to understand
at a deeper level.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:42.590
What it really is, it's
the rate which you are

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.900
willing to trade off.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.010
The rate at which you are
willing to trade off the

00:33:50.010 --> 00:33:52.180
y-axis for the x-axis.

00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:53.790
The rate at which you're
willing to trade

00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:55.040
off pizza for movies.

00:33:57.510 --> 00:34:00.070
So that's what it means
intuitively.

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:04.720
The slope of the curve tells you
that you're indifferent.

00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.630
Remember, you're indifferent
between any points along with

00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:07.540
this indifference curve.

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:12.260
You're indifferent between four
pizzas and one movie,

00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:15.159
you're indifferent between two
pizzas and two movies, and

00:34:15.159 --> 00:34:16.690
four movies and one pizza.

00:34:16.690 --> 00:34:17.679
You're indifferent
along all those

00:34:17.679 --> 00:34:20.090
combinations of figure 4-6.

00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:23.739
The MRS is the slope of that
curve telling you the rate at

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:28.750
which you're willing to trade
off pizza for movies.

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:32.820
Now just a side note here,
you're never, of course,

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:34.179
actually trading.

00:34:34.179 --> 00:34:35.850
There's not some market
where you bring a

00:34:35.850 --> 00:34:37.960
pizza and get a movie.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.659
So I didn't say trade, it's
not like baseball cards.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:42.429
I said trade off.

00:34:42.429 --> 00:34:47.190
What I mean is ultimately you
have some budget, and you have

00:34:47.190 --> 00:34:49.330
to allocate that budget.

00:34:49.330 --> 00:34:51.949
So if you decide to allocate
it on pizzas, you can't

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:53.190
allocate it on movies.

00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:55.215
Or the more you allocate on
pizzas, the less you can

00:34:55.215 --> 00:34:56.239
allocate on movies.

00:34:56.239 --> 00:34:58.110
So there's always a trade-off.

00:34:58.110 --> 00:35:00.350
Remember, I said, economics is
always about trade-offs.

00:35:00.350 --> 00:35:03.720
Given your limited budget,
there's always a trade off.

00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.720
And the rate at which you're
willing to trade off is your

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.180
marginal rate of substitution.

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:10.040
Given that you're going to have
to trade off-- and we

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:11.380
haven't got a bunch of
constraints yet, we'll get to

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:12.400
that next time--

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:13.713
the rate at which you're willing
to is your marginal

00:35:13.713 --> 00:35:14.600
rate of substitution.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:14.865
Yeah?

00:35:14.865 --> 00:35:17.755
AUDIENCE: Is that rate usually
related to the price?

00:35:17.755 --> 00:35:19.600
PROFESSOR: Ultimately no.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.090
I'm sorry.

00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:22.020
The marginal rate of
substitution purely comes from

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.310
your preferences.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:26.455
Ultimately to decide how much
you actually consume, you'll

00:35:26.455 --> 00:35:28.250
need to bring in the price.

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:30.850
So remember, I haven't talked
about prices here, we haven't

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:31.690
talked about that here.

00:35:31.690 --> 00:35:33.790
But this is a preference
concept.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:34.970
This has nothing to
do with prices.

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.230
But you're getting
ahead of us.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:39.990
We'll see next time, to decide
how much you actually consume,

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:41.570
you're going to relate the
marginal rate of substitution

00:35:41.570 --> 00:35:43.190
to the prices you face
in the market.

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:46.010
And that will decide how
much you consume.

00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:47.440
This is just a utility
concept.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:47.720
Yeah?

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:53.990
AUDIENCE: Did you say it was
the y-axis or the x-axis?

00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:55.902
That would be negative?

00:35:55.902 --> 00:35:56.390
PROFESSOR: It's negative.

00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:57.110
Yes.

00:35:57.110 --> 00:35:58.740
Of course.

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:00.080
Right, of course.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:03.620
The point is how many movies are
you willing to give up to

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.870
get another pizza?

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:09.230
How many pizzas are you willing
to give up to get

00:36:09.230 --> 00:36:10.010
another movie?

00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:13.010
MRS, it's very hard to remember
what's on the top,

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.490
what's on the bottom.

00:36:13.490 --> 00:36:14.620
Be very careful on this.

00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.080
But that's why I said remember
it's the y-axis or the x-axis.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.870
It's how many pizzas you're
willing to trade off to get

00:36:19.870 --> 00:36:21.120
another movie.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:26.870
Basically remember when I say
trade off, here, this is not

00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:30.310
that you're literally trading,
it's that ultimately you're

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:31.720
going to have to make
that trade-off.

00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.400
Ultimately when we come to the
next lecture and face a budget

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.670
constraint, you're going to have
to decide how do I want

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:37.540
to allocate my budget across
pizzas and movies?

00:36:37.540 --> 00:36:41.650
The way you're going to decide
that is by the relationship of

00:36:41.650 --> 00:36:45.220
how you feel about trading
off one for the other.

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.790
Now here's the key feature
of the MRS which

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:50.050
is the MRS is yeah?

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:51.254
Question?

00:36:51.254 --> 00:36:51.706
Yeah.

00:36:51.706 --> 00:36:53.559
AUDIENCE: That and exchange
rates are always changing

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:54.870
depending on how much you
happen to be trading.

00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:55.690
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:36:55.690 --> 00:37:00.010
The MRS is diminishing.

00:37:00.010 --> 00:37:02.180
Technically when you go to grad
school, you realize that

00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:04.020
marginal utility isn't actually
technically always

00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:04.440
diminishing.

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.010
I said it is.

00:37:05.010 --> 00:37:06.210
For this course it is.

00:37:06.210 --> 00:37:09.400
But if you want to get
mathematically correct, really

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:11.550
what's always diminishing that
you prove is the marginal rate

00:37:11.550 --> 00:37:14.670
of substitution is always
diminishing.

00:37:14.670 --> 00:37:16.230
So we have diminishing marginal
utility for the

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:19.490
purpose of this course, but the
really important concept

00:37:19.490 --> 00:37:23.320
is you have diminishing marginal
rate of substitution.

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:26.140
The rate at which you're willing
to trade off pizza for

00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:31.030
movies is going to fall
as you have less

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.700
pizza and more movies.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:37.940
So to see that, look at this
graph, and let's compute the

00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.060
marginal rate of substitution
along each segment.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.050
So let's localize.

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:44.170
Imagine the segments were
linear, imagine we had two

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:45.170
linear segments between
these points.

00:37:45.170 --> 00:37:46.000
We don't.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.210
But imagine for a
second we did.

00:37:48.210 --> 00:37:50.970
So the marginal rate of
substitution from the first

00:37:50.970 --> 00:37:55.140
point, four pizzas and one
movie, to the second point,

00:37:55.140 --> 00:37:57.940
two pizzas and two movies,
the marginal rate of

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:00.570
substitution is -2.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:06.380
You are willing to give up two
pizzas to get one movie.

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.980
This is the same graph,
figure 4-6.

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:11.160
This isn't on the graph, you
have to write it on.

00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.300
So going from that first point
to that second point, you're

00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:18.310
willing to give up two pizzas
to get one movie.

00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:21.330
So that rate of marginal
substitution is -2.

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:25.620
However, when you're at two
movies and two pizzas, and I

00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.220
say OK, how about giving up one
more pizza to see movies?

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:30.580
Now you say, wait a second.

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.420
To give up one more pizza,
I need to see two movies.

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.390
My marginal rate of substitution
on that second

00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:39.340
segment is -1/2.

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:40.680
The marginal rate of
substitution on the first

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.990
segment is -2.

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:43.940
The marginal rate of
substitution on the second

00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:44.690
segment is -1/2.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:46.860
Once again, assuming they're not
linear, so it's actually

00:38:46.860 --> 00:38:48.587
changing everywhere, but if they
were linear, that's what

00:38:48.587 --> 00:38:49.480
it would be.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.610
Can someone tell me why?

00:38:51.610 --> 00:38:55.230
Why is the marginal rate of
substitution falling?

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:58.060
Why is the marginal rate of
substitution lower on that

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.959
second segment than
on the first?

00:38:59.959 --> 00:39:04.699
AUDIENCE: Because marginal
utility increases the fewer of

00:39:04.699 --> 00:39:06.446
something you have.

00:39:06.446 --> 00:39:07.950
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.180
So go ahead, flesh it out, the
fewer of somthing you have, so

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:13.100
tell me in terms of the trade
you're willing to make.

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.315
AUDIENCE: You value it more, so
you want to trade more of

00:39:17.315 --> 00:39:18.205
something else for it.

00:39:18.205 --> 00:39:22.893
PROFESSOR: The point is when I
have four pizzas my marginal

00:39:22.893 --> 00:39:26.600
utility of that last pizza
is not very high.

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.380
And I'm fine to give
up two pizzas--

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:32.360
and plus I'm only seeing one
movie, there's a second movie

00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:33.820
I really want to see.

00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:36.220
So you say to me, look,
I've got four pizzas,

00:39:36.220 --> 00:39:37.700
I'm seeing one movie.

00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.420
You say hey, there's a
second movie out I

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.460
know you want to see.

00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.500
I know you don't really
value four pizzas.

00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:43.850
At the end, you're
totally full.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:45.350
Would you be willing to give
up two pizzas to see the

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:45.720
second movie?

00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.380
And you're like, sure why not?

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.210
Well once you have two pizzas
and you've seen two movies,

00:39:50.210 --> 00:39:51.930
you're not that interested in
a third movie and you'll be

00:39:51.930 --> 00:39:54.610
hungry if you have less than two
pizzas, so then you say,

00:39:54.610 --> 00:39:55.060
wait a second.

00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.970
If you want me to give up
another pizza, you've got to

00:39:56.970 --> 00:39:59.800
give me two movies.

00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:04.220
Because my marginal utility of
pizzas is rising, my marginal

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.570
utility of movies is falling.

00:40:07.570 --> 00:40:09.600
And that's why the marginal
rate of substitution

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:15.490
diminishes along the
indifference curve.

00:40:15.490 --> 00:40:18.160
So that allows us to write
mathematically the definition

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.470
of the marginal rate of
substitution is the negative

00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:26.180
of the marginal utility of
movies, or more generally

00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:32.030
what's on the x-axis, over the
marginal utility of pizza, or

00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:33.280
more generally what's
on the y-axis.

00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:37.670
The marginal rate of
substitution, the first key

00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:39.992
formula you need to know for
this course, the marginal rate

00:40:39.992 --> 00:40:41.060
of substitution is equal to the

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:42.310
ratio of marginal utilities.

00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:46.720
Now this is tricky.

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.060
Maybe you guys don't find it
tricky, it's the kind of thing

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.010
I find tricky.

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:57.810
Which is I defined it as delta
y-axis over delta x-axis.

00:40:57.810 --> 00:40:59.930
And yet, when I defined here
the marginal utilities, I

00:40:59.930 --> 00:41:01.880
flipped it.

00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:03.700
I did the marginal utility of
what's on the x-axis over the

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:04.810
marginal utility of what's
on the y-axis.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:05.300
Why is that?

00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.430
Can anyone tell me
why that is?

00:41:06.430 --> 00:41:08.154
Why is it flipped
when defined in

00:41:08.154 --> 00:41:09.595
terms of marginal utilities?

00:41:09.595 --> 00:41:09.910
Yeah?

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:12.518
AUDIENCE: It's a denominator.

00:41:12.518 --> 00:41:14.506
So utility over movies--

00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:20.510
PROFESSOR: Well, let me try for
slightly more, how does

00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:21.320
marginal utility relate?

00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:21.575
Yeah.

00:41:21.575 --> 00:41:28.291
AUDIENCE: Marginal utility
is delta P over

00:41:28.291 --> 00:41:30.279
P. So it gets flipped.

00:41:30.279 --> 00:41:30.780
Because of--

00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:32.140
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:34.620
Yeah, you're giving the
same answer, which

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.490
is technically right.

00:41:35.490 --> 00:41:38.470
What I was more looking for but
it's the intuitive version

00:41:38.470 --> 00:41:42.380
of that, marginal utility is a
negative function of quantity.

00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:44.810
Marginal utility is a negative
function of quantity.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.700
So the fact that it's a ratio of
the quantity of pizza over

00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.000
the quantity of movies is the
same thing as the marginal

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.340
utility of movies over the
marginal utility of pizza.

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:54.890
Because marginal utility is a
negative function of quantity.

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:56.300
The more quantity you
have, the lower is

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:58.440
your marginal utility.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:42:01.060
And that's the key
to understand.

00:42:01.060 --> 00:42:05.460
So it's the slope of the
indifference curve which is

00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.485
the ratio of the marginal
utilities, but it's the

00:42:07.485 --> 00:42:10.700
marginal utility of
movies over pizza.

00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:14.290
Because what that's saying is
that as you get more movies,

00:42:14.290 --> 00:42:17.730
you care less about each
additional movie and ditto

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:18.980
with pizzas.

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:22.250
Let's just look at this for
a minute, think about it

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:23.270
intuitively for a minute.

00:42:23.270 --> 00:42:25.590
We've seen it graphically,
we're seeing it

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:27.510
mathematically, let's make
sure we understand it

00:42:27.510 --> 00:42:29.120
intuitively.

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:33.630
What this is saying is that
as you get more movies--

00:42:33.630 --> 00:42:36.470
so let's relate this
to the graph.

00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:41.800
As you get more movies and less
pizza, as you move down

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:45.160
that curve, more movies, less
pizza, what's happening?

00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.930
What's happening to the marginal
utility of movies as

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:48.650
you move down that curve?

00:42:48.650 --> 00:42:50.190
What direction is it heading?

00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:51.500
AUDIENCE: It's decreasing.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:51.870
PROFESSOR: What?

00:42:51.870 --> 00:42:52.240
AUDIENCE: It's decreasing.

00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.270
PROFESSOR: It's decreasing.

00:42:54.270 --> 00:42:56.540
Because you're getting more
movies and marginal utility is

00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.260
a negative function
of quantity.

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:02.770
Likewise, the marginal utility
of pizza is increasing because

00:43:02.770 --> 00:43:05.850
you're getting less
pizza so you care

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:07.720
about each pizza more.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.900
And that's why the marginal
rate of substitution

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.150
diminishes.

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:16.470
That's why it diminishes because
as you move down that

00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:19.830
curve, the numerator is falling,
the denominator is

00:43:19.830 --> 00:43:20.690
increasing.

00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:23.220
And that's why we have
everywhere diminishing

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:24.470
marginal rates of
substitution.

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:35.140
So another way to think about
this is imagine for a moment

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:38.150
what life would be like if we
didn't have diminishing

00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:39.990
marginal rates of
substitution.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:42.460
And once again I'm going to try,
once again Jessica, next

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.700
year we'll let you
make this pretty.

00:43:43.700 --> 00:43:46.450
But I'm going to try to
draw it crudely here.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:48.990
Let's do pizzas and
movies again.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:53.980
Let's do pizzas and
movies again.

00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.570
Movies and pizza.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:01.639
And that's one, two,
three, four.

00:44:07.062 --> 00:44:10.000
One, two, three, four.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.560
Now let's imagine that instead
of diminishing marginal

00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.230
utility and instead of
indifference curves being

00:44:16.230 --> 00:44:19.200
convex to the origin, imagine
if indifference curves were

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.270
concave to the origin, which
is what increasing marginal

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:24.355
rate substitution would imply.

00:44:24.355 --> 00:44:26.200
So that would be something where
you'd be indifferent

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:32.530
between four pizzas and one
movie, between three pizzas

00:44:32.530 --> 00:44:36.740
and two movies, and between one
pizza and three movies.

00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.680
So your indifference curve
would look like that.

00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.495
Not quite to scale,
but you get it.

00:44:40.495 --> 00:44:43.390
It would be concave to the
origin instead of convex to

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.320
the origin.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:47.930
In this case, marginal rates
of substitution would be

00:44:47.930 --> 00:44:49.830
everywhere increasing.

00:44:49.830 --> 00:44:53.370
That is, basically I'd be
willing to give up one pizza

00:44:53.370 --> 00:44:55.390
to get one movie.

00:44:55.390 --> 00:44:58.670
But to get that next movie,
I'd give up two pizzas.

00:44:58.670 --> 00:45:02.050
But as you can see, that
doesn't make sense.

00:45:02.050 --> 00:45:04.900
It doesn't make sense that given
that as long as you're

00:45:04.900 --> 00:45:07.250
ranking movies, or even more in
the example of seeing the

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:08.590
same movie over and over
again, it's maybe more

00:45:08.590 --> 00:45:11.050
compelling.

00:45:11.050 --> 00:45:15.810
That basically what you can see
is that if you're willing

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.310
to give up one pizza to see that
movie a second time, why

00:45:19.310 --> 00:45:22.550
would you possibly give up two
pizzas to see it a third time?

00:45:22.550 --> 00:45:24.340
That makes no sense at all.

00:45:24.340 --> 00:45:27.210
If you only like it so much you
only give up one pizza to

00:45:27.210 --> 00:45:29.740
see it a second time, why would
you possibly give up two

00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:30.870
pizzas to see it a third time?

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:32.510
You wouldn't.

00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:33.650
It doesn't make sense.

00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:36.930
And that's why marginal rate
of substitution has to be

00:45:36.930 --> 00:45:39.520
everywhere decreasing, it
can't be increasing.

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:39.795
Yeah?

00:45:39.795 --> 00:45:42.450
AUDIENCE: Could it
remain constant?

00:45:42.450 --> 00:45:43.858
PROFESSOR: It could actually
remain constant.

00:45:43.858 --> 00:45:45.070
Yes, that's right.

00:45:45.070 --> 00:45:46.230
You can be indifferent.

00:45:46.230 --> 00:45:48.640
My indifference curves--

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:51.210
how many of you guys have
seen Toy Story 3?

00:45:51.210 --> 00:45:53.480
I think it's one of my 10
favorite movies of all time.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.970
The greatest children's
movie ever made.

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:56.900
I've seen it three times.

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.050
My indifference curve
is virtually--

00:45:58.050 --> 00:45:59.625
I've enjoyed it the third times
as much as the first--

00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:02.840
it's virtually flat with
respect to Toy Story 3.

00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:05.870
I could see it 10 more times and
feel pretty much the same.

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.340
So that's certainly possible
that it would be constant,

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.110
that I'd be willing to give
up whatever I pay--

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:12.840
$10 a shot to see it.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.180
It's possible.

00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:18.900
So basically, almost always,
inequalities will be greater

00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:21.020
than or equal to, or less than
or equal to in this course.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.250
It's more fun to talk about
the not equal to case, the

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.180
non-linear case.

00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.290
But linear cases will
exist as well.

00:46:26.290 --> 00:46:28.610
It's just a can't be can't
be opposite sign.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:31.370
You can't have an increasing
marginal rate of substitution.

00:46:31.370 --> 00:46:31.665
Another question over here?

00:46:31.665 --> 00:46:34.828
AUDIENCE: What about
addictions?

00:46:34.828 --> 00:46:36.078
You could want it more
the second time.

00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:40.210
PROFESSOR: That's interesting.

00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:41.885
So how would addiction
work? so basically--

00:46:41.885 --> 00:46:46.350
AUDIENCE: Well it's not
really decreasing.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:48.670
You need more the second
time, right?

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:49.297
So it has to--

00:46:49.297 --> 00:46:50.051
PROFESSOR: That's very
interesting.

00:46:50.051 --> 00:46:53.010
I mean in some sense.

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:58.160
So you give up one pizza for
the first shot of heroin.

00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:03.326
And then, you're hooked, so then
you'd be willing to give

00:47:03.326 --> 00:47:04.960
up two pizzas for the
next shot of heroin.

00:47:09.433 --> 00:47:10.700
Yeah, I guess so.

00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.610
I guess that's right.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:14.860
I guess we're going to have to
stay away from addiction in

00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:16.440
this course.

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:19.470
I guess an addictive good
could look like that.

00:47:19.470 --> 00:47:21.380
That's a very good point.

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.490
Other questions, comments?

00:47:24.490 --> 00:47:27.440
So what we're doing is we're
going to stop here,

00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:30.420
understanding that we're
going to have--

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:31.670
leaving this example aside--
we're going to have

00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:32.710
diminishing marginal--

00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:33.290
yes one more question?

00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:34.540
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:47:42.817 --> 00:47:45.970
PROFESSOR: Basically, we're
assuming by non-satiation that

00:47:45.970 --> 00:47:47.500
ever happens.

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:49.360
So once again, that would
violate the non-satiation.

00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.800
The problem with the
addictiveness example is the

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:54.580
reason it wouldn't work in
this course is eventually

00:47:54.580 --> 00:47:56.630
you'd violate your budget
constraint because you'd want

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:58.340
more and more and more.

00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.810
Maybe not.

00:47:59.810 --> 00:48:01.830
But in any case, we're going to
ignore that example, assume

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:04.090
diminishing marginal rate of
substitution, and we'll come

00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:05.930
back next time as I put this
together with a budget

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:07.360
constraint to actually
dictate your choices.

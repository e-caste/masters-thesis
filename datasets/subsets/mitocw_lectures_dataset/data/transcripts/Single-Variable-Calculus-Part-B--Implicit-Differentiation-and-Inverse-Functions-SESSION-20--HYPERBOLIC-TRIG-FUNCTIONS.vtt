JOEL LEWIS: Hi.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.970
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.980
Today I wanted to talk
about something that's

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.300
mentioned in the notes but
wasn't covered in lecture

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.250
because of the exam review.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.780
So this is, the subject is
hyperbolic trig functions.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.111
So first I just wanted to define
them for you and graph them

00:00:23.111 --> 00:00:25.110
so we can get a little
bit of a feeling for what

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.040
these functions are
like, and then I'm

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.240
going to explain to you why
they have the words hyperbolic

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.440
and trig in their names.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.950
So these are some
interesting functions.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.360
They're not, they don't--
aren't quite as important

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.470
as your usual, sort of
circular trig functions.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.050
But yeah, so let me introduce
them and let me jump

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.520
in just with their definition.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.340
So there are two
most important ones.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.150
Just like a regular
trigonometric functions

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.200
there's the sine and
the cosine and then

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.440
you can write the other
four trigonometric functions

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.370
in terms of them.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.370
So for hyperbolic
trig functions we

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.260
have the hyperbolic cosine
and the hyperbolic sine.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.760
So the notation here,
we write c o s h.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.970
So the h for hyperbolic.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.560
So hyperbolic cosine.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.530
And usually we
pronounce this "cosh."

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.880
And similarly, for
the hyperbolic sine

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.500
we write s i n h,
for hyperbolic sine,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.180
except in the reverse order.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.920
And we usually pronounce this
"sinch," so in American English

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.630
as if there were an
extra c in there.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.080
Sinch.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.580
OK.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.650
So these functions have
fairly simple definitions

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.570
in terms of the exponential
function, e to the x.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.050
So cosh of x is defined to be e
to the x plus e to the minus x

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.470
divided by 2.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.730
And sinh of x is defined to be
e to x minus e to the minus x

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.030
divided by 2.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.070
So if you remember what
your graph of e to the x

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.390
looks like, and your
graph of e to the minus x,

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.111
it's not hard to see that the
graphs of cosh x and sinh x

00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:58.360
should look sort of like this.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.200
So for cosh x, so we see as
x gets big, so e to the minus

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.150
x is going to 0.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.220
It's not very important.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.210
So it mostly is driven
by this e to the x part.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.570
And as x gets negative and
big, then this is going to 0

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.140
and this is getting
larger and larger.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.420
So we got something
that looks like this.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.647
So it looks a little
bit, in this picture

00:02:20.647 --> 00:02:22.230
it looks a little
bit like a parabola,

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.586
but the growth here is
exponential at both sides.

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:26.710
So in fact, this is growing
much, much, much faster

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.270
than, say, 1 plus x squared.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:30.730
So it's a much steeper curve.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.010
OK.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.060
And it reaches its
minimum here at x

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.780
equals 0-- it has the
value 1 plus 1 over 2.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.460
So its minimum there
is at x equals 0,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.872
it has its minimum value 1.

00:02:44.872 --> 00:02:47.080
For sinh, OK, so we're taking
the difference of them.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.370
So it's similar when x
is positive and large,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.230
e to the x is big,
and e to the minus

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.480
x is pretty small,
almost negligible.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.260
So we got exponential
growth off that side.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.230
When x becomes
negative and large,

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.060
e to the x is going to 0, e to
the minus x is becoming large,

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.380
but it's-- we've got
a minus sign here.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.880
So as x goes to minus
infinity, this curve

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.700
goes also to minus infinity.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.300
And again, the growth here
is exponential in both cases.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.400
And if you were curious, say
about what the slope there

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.970
at the origin is, you could
quickly take a derivative

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.760
and check that that's passing
through the origin with slope 1

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.140
there.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.640
OK.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.730
So this is a sort
of basic picture

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.810
of what these curves look like.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.260
They have some nice properties,
and let me talk about them.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.614
So for example,
one nice thing you

00:03:46.614 --> 00:03:48.030
might notice about
these functions

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:49.988
is that it's easy to
compute their derivatives.

00:03:49.988 --> 00:03:50.830
Right?

00:03:50.830 --> 00:04:01.640
So if we look at d/dx of cosh
x, in order to compute that,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.440
well, just look at the
definition of cosh.

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.450
So it's really just a sum of
two exponential functions.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.130
Exponential functions are
easy to take the derivatives.

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.490
Take the derivative of e to
the x, you get e to the x.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.390
Take the derivative of e to
the minus x, well, OK, so

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.790
it's a little chain rule, so
you get a minus 1 in front.

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:23.407
So the derivative of cosh x is
e to the x minus e to the minus

00:04:23.407 --> 00:04:25.310
x over 2.

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.810
But we have a name for this.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.250
This is actually just sinh x.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.550
So the derivative
of cosh is sinh,

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:42.370
and the derivative
of sinh, well, OK.

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.117
You look at the same
thing, take this formula,

00:04:45.117 --> 00:04:45.950
take its derivative.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.737
Well, e to the x, take its
derivative, you get e to the x.

00:04:48.737 --> 00:04:50.320
e to the minus x,
take its derivative,

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.220
you get minus e to the minus
x, so those two minus signs

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.860
cancel out and become a plus.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:01.660
So this is e to the x plus
e to the minus x over 2,

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.860
which is cosh x.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.942
So here you have
some behavior that's

00:05:05.942 --> 00:05:08.400
a little bit reminiscent of
the behavior of trig functions.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.980
Right?

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.510
For trig functions, if you
take the derivative of sine

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.514
you get cosine.

00:05:12.514 --> 00:05:14.180
And if you take the
derivative of cosine

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.390
you almost get back sine,
but you get minus sine.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.236
So here you don't have
that extra negative sign

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:19.902
floating around.

00:05:19.902 --> 00:05:20.690
Right?

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.560
So you, when you take
the derivative of cosh

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.550
you get sinh on the nose.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:27.080
No minus sign needed.

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.630
So that's interesting.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.150
But the real reason
that these have

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.200
the words trig in their name is
actually a little bit deeper.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.810
So let me come over here
and draw a couple pictures.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.960
So the normal trig
functions-- what sometimes we

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.270
call the circular trig functions
if we want to distinguish them

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.730
from the hyperbolic trig
functions-- they're closely--

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.420
so circular trig
functions, they're

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.560
closely related to
the unit circle.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.110
So the unit circle
has equation x squared

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:05.790
plus y squared equals 1.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:06.820
It's a circle.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.600
Well, close enough, right?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.870
And what is the
nice relationship

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:14.860
between this circle
and the trig functions?

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.500
Well, if you choose any
point on this circle,

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.990
then there exists
some value of t

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.980
such that this point
has coordinates

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.890
cosine t comma sine t.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.080
Now it happens
that the value of t

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.640
is actually the angle
that that radius makes

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.407
with the positive axis.

00:06:35.407 --> 00:06:37.240
But not going to worry
about that right now.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.830
It's not the key idea of import.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.330
So as t varies through
the real numbers,

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.500
the point cosine t,
sine t, that varies

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.130
and it just goes
around this curve.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.530
So it traces out
this circle exactly.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:55.550
So the hyperbolic
trig functions show up

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.670
in a very similar situation.

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.170
But instead of
looking at the unit

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.060
circle, what we
want to look at is

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.567
the unit rectangular hyperbola.

00:07:04.567 --> 00:07:05.650
So what do I mean by that?

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.790
Well, so instead of
taking the equation

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:11.240
x squared plus y squared
equals 1, which gives a circle,

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.340
I'm going to look at a
very similar equation that

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.310
gives a hyperbola.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:19.950
So this is the equation
x squared minus y squared

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.690
equals 1.

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:28.970
So if you if you graph this
equation, what you'll see

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:32.250
is that, well, it passes
through the point (1, 0).

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:38.690
And then we've got
one branch here,

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:40.650
we've got a little
asymptote there.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.550
So it's got a right
branch like that,

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.760
and also it's symmetric
across the y-axis.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:08:00.570
So there's a symmetric
left branch here.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.750
So this is the graph
of the equation

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:05.890
x squared minus y
squared equals 1.

00:08:05.890 --> 00:08:09.200
So it's this hyperbola.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:14.110
Now what I claim is
that cosh and sinh have

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:18.050
the same relationship to this
hyperbola as cosine and sine

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.020
have to the circle.

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.180
Well, so I'm fudging
a little bit.

00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:24.440
So it turns out it's only the
right half of the hyperbola.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:25.610
So what do I mean by that?

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.210
Well, here's what
I'd like to do.

00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:33.040
Set x equals-- so we're going
to introduce a new variable,

00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:41.090
u-- I'm going to set x equal
cosh u and y equals sinh u.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:43.540
And I'm going to
look at the quantity

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.850
x squared minus y squared.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:48.770
So x squared minus y squared.

00:08:51.481 --> 00:08:53.480
So this is, so we use
most of the same notations

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.020
for hyperbolic trig
functions that we

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:56.270
do for regular trig functions.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:04.820
So this is cosh squared
u minus sinh squared u.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.246
And now we can plug in the
formulas for cosh and sinh

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:08.110
that we have.

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:16.690
So this is equal to e to the u
plus e to the minus u over 2,

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:22.150
quantity squared, minus e to
the u minus e to the minus

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:25.990
u over 2, quantity squared.

00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:28.650
And now we can expand
out both of these factors

00:09:28.650 --> 00:09:33.070
and-- both of these squares,
rather, and put them together.

00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:37.540
So over 2 squared is
over 4 and we square this

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:39.860
and we get e to the 2u.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.480
OK, so then we get 2 times e to
the u times e to the minus u.

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:48.170
But e to the u times e to the
minus u is just 1, so plus 2.

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:59.170
Plus e to the minus 2u minus
e to the 2u minus 2 plus e

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:03.840
to the minus 2u-- so same
thing over here-- over 4.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:07.320
OK, so the e to the 2u's cancel
and the e to the minus 2u's

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.580
cancel and we're left
with 2 minus minus 2.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:10.420
That's 4.

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.860
So this is 4 over 4,
so this is equal to 1.

00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:14.360
OK.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:19.060
So if x is equal to cosh u
and y is equal to sinh u,

00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:21.970
then x squared minus y
squared is equal to 1.

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:26.270
So if we choose a point
(cosh u, sinh u) for some u,

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.850
that point lies
on this hyperbola.

00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:29.844
That's what this says.

00:10:29.844 --> 00:10:35.540
That this point-- OK, so
the point (cosh u, sinh u)

00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:38.150
is somewhere on this hyperbola.

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.040
And what's also true is the
sort of reverse statement.

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:45.980
If you look at all such points,
if you let u vary and look--

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.640
through the real
numbers and you ask

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.210
what happens to this
point (cosh u, sinh u),

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.620
the answers is that it
traces out the right half

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:53.700
of this hyperbola.

00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.805
If you go back to the
graph of y equals cosh x,

00:10:56.805 --> 00:10:59.750
you'll see that the hyperbolic
cosine function is always

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:00.580
positive.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.070
So we can't-- over here, we
can't trace out this left

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:05.610
branch where x is negative.

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:07.700
Although it's easy
enough to say what does

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.950
trace out this left branch.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:12.280
Since it's just
the mirror image,

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:18.740
this is traced out by
minus cosh u comma sinh u.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.520
So there's a-- so the
hyperbolic trig functions have

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.870
the same relationship to
this branch of this hyperbola

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.120
that the regular trig
functions have to the circle.

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.070
So there's where the words
hyperbolic and trig functions

00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:36.120
come from.

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.230
So let me say one
more thing about them,

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:41.830
which is that we
saw that they have

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:45.060
this analogy with
regular trig functions.

00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:45.560
Right?

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.820
So instead of satisfying
cosine squared

00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:52.350
plus sine squared equals 1, they
satisfy cosh squared minus sinh

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:53.590
squared equals 1.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.770
And instead of satisfying
the derivative of sine

00:11:56.770 --> 00:12:00.250
equals cosine and the derivative
of cosine equals minus sine,

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:03.150
they satisfy derivative
of cosh equals

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:05.990
sinh and derivative
of sinh equals cosh.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.690
So similar relationships.

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.680
Not exactly the
same, but similar.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.010
So this is true of a lot
of trig relationships,

00:12:13.010 --> 00:12:16.960
that there's a corresponding
formula for the hyperbolic trig

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.560
functions.

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.170
So one example of such
a formula is your--

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:24.790
for example, your angle
addition formulas.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:28.160
So I'm going to just leave
this is an exercise for you.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.482
So let me, I guess
I'll just stick it

00:12:31.482 --> 00:12:33.440
in this funny little
piece of board right here.

00:12:36.284 --> 00:12:36.825
So, exercise.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:13:03.580
Find sinh of x plus y and cosh
of x plus y in terms of sinh

00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:14.380
x, cosh x, sinh y, and cosh y.

00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:17.890
So in other words, find
the corresponding formula

00:13:17.890 --> 00:13:20.070
to the angle addition
formula in that case

00:13:20.070 --> 00:13:21.980
of the hyperbolic
trig functions.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.637
So I'll leave you with that.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Continuing our discussion of
acid-base theory,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
I have just drawn here on the
board for you the structure of a

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
popular indicator molecule.
Indicator molecules are used

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
for titrations.
And titrations will be of focus

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of today's lecture.
This is the indicator molecule,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
phenolphthalein.
It is easier to draw this

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
molecular structure than it is
to spell phenolphthalein,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
but you should know how to do
both of these things,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
or at least recognize them.
Now, how do indicator molecules

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
work?
Well, during a titration,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
you are mixing chemicals in a
way that leads to a changing pH

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.000
throughout the experiment.
And an indicator molecule like

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
phenolphthalein is,
in fact, a Bronsted acid.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And, if you inspect the
structure that I have drawn here

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
for phenolphthalein,
you should be able to begin to

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
understand just how it is that a
molecule like this can serve as

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
a Bronsted acid.
If I write out the formula,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
you will see that we have quite
a number of carbons and

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
hydrogens in the molecule.
And we have oxygens as well.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Those are the three elements
present in a phenolphthalein

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
molecule.
And two of the hydrogens in

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
this molecule possess Bronsted
acidity that makes them valuable

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
for the function of this system
as an indicator molecule.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
And what happens is when you
have this in solution at low pH,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
it is in this form.
It is neutral.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
And then, as you begin to raise
the pH, at some point a base

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
that has a lone pair of
electrons comes along and takes

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.000
one of these two protons in a
molecule, either this one or

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
this one.
Those two protons are

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
equivalent.
And what I am now going to draw

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
is a sequence of arrows
representing the electronic flow

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
in the phenolphthalein molecule
that occurs when H plus

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
is transferred over to the base
with its lone pair of electrons.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
So, I am starting these arrows
at pairs of electrons and I am

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
showing the flow of how they
move.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
And this is a pretty
interesting rearrangement

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
because it is complicated.
It is an electronic

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
rearrangement that is
transmitted through this

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
molecule such that here in the
center, this four coordinate or

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
sp three hybridized
carbon, which is bonded to this

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
oxygen, has a pair of electrons
that migrates to it.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
And, if I draw now the product
of this reaction,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.000
what you should be able to see
quite clearly --

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
And I am not always explicitly
drawing out the lone pairs of

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
electrons on each of the
electronegative oxygen atoms in

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
the molecule,
but the sequence of double

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
bonds and single bonds in the
molecule has been altered in a

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:23.000
profound manner because of the
base coming along and removing a

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
proton from one of these
peripheral oxygens,

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
namely, that one here.
So, we have now a singly

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000
negatively charged system.
And that charge is balanced,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000
over here, by the base that has
the proton attached to it.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000
That is the structure-function
relationship that is typical of

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
indicator molecules.
And indicator molecules can

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000
either be naturally occurring,
as they are in some plants.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Or, alternatively,
they can be molecules that are

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
synthesized to respond to
factors like pH in a given way

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that might be desired.
And, in the case of

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
phenolphthalein,
this change takes place between

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000
8.2 to 10.0 pH units.
And the color change associated

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000
with this is colorless to pink.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
Looking at the structure of the
anionic form of the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
phenolphthalein molecule that
results from its deprotonation,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
what you can see is that this
sp three hybridized

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
carbon atom at the center of the
molecule, which in the neutral

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
form is acting as an insulator,
preventing the pi-systems of

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
the three six-member rings from
communicating,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
is converted into a
three-coordinate sp two

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
hybridized carbon atom here at
the center, --

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
and provides a conduit for a
communication between the

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
pi-systems of the three
six-membered substituted benzene

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
rings that are in this molecule.
And that change in electronic

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
structure is what leads to the
production of this pink

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Chromaphor in the anionic
deprotonated form of a

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000
phenolphthalein molecule that is
important at high pH.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
All you have to do,
in fact, is to change the

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
substituents on this molecule in
order to get a response at a

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000
different pH value.
Bromothymol blue is an

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
indicator with a structure
similar to that of

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
phenolphthalein,
but with a sulfur here in place

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
of this carbon.
And in bromothymol blue,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000
we also have some isopropyl and
bromine substituents on the

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
aromatic rings.
And that modifies its

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
properties such that it goes
from yellow to blue as the pH

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
rises above 6.0 to about a value
of 7.6.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:29.000
So, if you go to a textbook and
look in a table of indicator

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000
molecules, you will be able to
select an indicator that is

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
appropriate for a particular
type of titration.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
And just to give you a very
simple schematic of a classic

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
type of titration,
I am going to show you here --

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000
-- the type of system that you
may need to think about in

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:06.000
connection with this next
problem set.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:13.000
And it is a system like this,
where we have a flask down here

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
at the bottom that contains,
initially, some volume of a

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
weak acid.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that weak acid might be,
for example,

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
acetic acid,
as we talked about last time.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And we will say,
for example,

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.000
that this could be 0.1 molar CH
three COOH.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
That is acetic acid.
And the calculation that we

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:51.000
left off with at the end of last
hour is one that we will get to

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
solving today that had to do
with what is the pH of a tenth

00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000
molar acetic acid solution in
water?

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Or, in other words,
what is the pH of this solution

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
down here containing the acetic
acid at the beginning of this

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
titration that we are going to
carry out.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
We might have a weak acid down
here.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
We might also have our
indicator present,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
so that we will see a color
change when we pass through a

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
particular pH.
And we are going to make the pH

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
rise by putting into this
burette here,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:36.000
which will allow us to control
a dropwise addition of a strong

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000
base solution that we are going
to add in and slowly neutralize

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
our acetic acid that is down
here at the bottom.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
So, this is strong base.
And, for example,

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
that might be tenth molar
sodium hydroxide.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
So, there is a typical
titration.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
And, if you think about it,
because we are adding one

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
solution to another,
we are going to have a

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:12.000
constantly changing volume in
this bottom solution throughout

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
the experiment.
And so ultimately what we are

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
going to be interested in,
in our questions such as the

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
following, as the volume
increases --

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And we will give the volume,
for the purposes of today's

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000
lecture, the symbol the lower
case letter m -- As the volume

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
increases, what happens to the
pH?

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.000
We know that we are using a
strong base to neutralize an

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
acid, so the pH is going to
start out low and somehow is

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
going to rise.
But what if we wanted to

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
predict the mathematical form of
the rise in pH as a function of

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
this increasing volume of the
solution?

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Then we would have to have some
equations that would be useful

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
for describing this physical
property as a function of this

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000
increasing volume.
This is what we often want to

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
be able to do in chemistry.
We want to be able to describe

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000
properties that change either as
a function of time or as a

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
function of some other variable,
here volume,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000
in a titration.
And we want to be able to see

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
if we can come up with a set of
equations that would predict

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.000
that change as a function of
this variable that is changing.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And, in order to do that,
here, I am going to first point

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.000
out that we can put together
some titration equations.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
And, ultimately,
we are going to want to

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000
generate a mathematical model
for this titration.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And then, if you are
experimentalist,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
you want to go ahead and take
that mathematical model and

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
compare it to actual
experimental data.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
But let's work on getting a
model generated,

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
here.
First we are going to have a

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.000
set of chemical equations.
These correspond to the acid

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:35.000
HA, which is acetic acid in our
example, in water reacting to

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000
give some concentration of H
three O plus plus the

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000
anion A minus,
which is acetate ion,

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000
in this particular case.
We have a strong base,

00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000
which is sodium hydroxide.
And when you put sodium

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000
hydroxide in water,
because it is a strong base,

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
it ionizes completely.
And I am signifying that with a

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000
single forward arrow rather than
with an equilibrium arrow.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
This going into water is going
to be Na plus and

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000
hydroxide, OH minus.
Now, at certain points in a

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
titration curve,
you would not need to

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
necessarily go much further than
this in order to have enough

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
information to start solving for
the pH at a particular value of

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:40.000
a volume m.
But at some points along that

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000
titration curve,
that is not enough information.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000
And that is because water
itself can sometimes get into

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
the equation.
Here is an interesting

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000
equation, which is H two O plus
H two O going to H three O plus

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.000
plus O minus.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000
That is a conceivable reaction
that could be occurring even in

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000
pure water, but the value of the
equilibrium constant for that

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000
reaction is very small.
And I will draw that as an

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
equilibrium to distinguish it
from the irreversible ionization

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
of sodium hydroxide in aqueous
solution.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I have a pair of equilibria
that I have written.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
I have one forward reaction.
And I want to point out,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
too, that this third equation I
have written here has a special

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
name, which is autoprotolysis.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000
I will tell you more about the
equilibrium constant associated

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
with autoprotolysis in a moment.
But because this equilibrium

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
constant is very small,
meaning that there is very

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
little H three O plus
and OH minus present in

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
pure water, because of that pure
water itself is not a very good

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000
electrolyte.
Meaning pure water itself is

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
not a very good conductor of
electricity, because the

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000
autoprotolysis reaction lies
mostly over here to the left in

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
pure water.
But at certain points along a

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
titration curve,
such as the one we are going to

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000
want to develop on this panel
here, we are going to need to

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000
include autoprotolysis in order
to get the right answer because

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
it is there, it can occur.
Let's continue.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Another type of equation that
we can use to put this into some

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:14.000
kind of a mathematical footing
is the balance of charge in a

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000
solution like the one that we
are talking about in that beaker

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:25.000
to which we are adding sodium
hydroxide solution.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:31.000
And the charge balance
consideration tells us that the

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000
concentration of hydronium ion
plus the concentration of sodium

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
ion must be equal to the
concentration of hydroxide plus

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
the concentration of acetate
ion, A minus.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Because what I have done here
in the charge balance

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
consideration is I have said
okay, what are all the possible

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
charged species in solution?
I can make a list of them.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
It is those four things.
And I know that the number of

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
positive charges must equal the
number of negative charges

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
because this is overall a
neutral beaker in which we are

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
putting things.
But everything that you put in

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
is charge neutral,
so the positives have to equal

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:22.000
the negatives.
That is a very nice limiting

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
equation that helps us
understand how the different

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
competing chemical reactions and
equilibria will all settle down

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000
and arrive at the physical
result, which will be our

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
observable.
And then, in addition to that,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
we have a mass balance
consideration.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And in this mass balance
consideration,

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:57.000
we will be able to write that
our HA initial value --

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000
-- that is square brackets,
once again, denoting

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000
concentration -- will be,
at any point in time,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
equal to the actual value of HA
plus the concentration of A

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
minus.
And that just says that when

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
you have acetic acid and you put
it into water,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000
it ionizes partly to hydronium
ion and acetate ion.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
And that which does not ionize
is unionized HA.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And so, the ionized A minus
concentration plus the

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000
unionized HA concentration is
equal to the sum total of the

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.000
acetic acid that is present in
solution.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000
And, similarly,
we have another mass balance

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000
equation, which is just that the
sodium hydroxide initial is

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
equal to our sodium ion
concentration because all of it

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
is ionized.
That is a little simpler than

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
the situation with the acetic
acid.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:20.000
And then, in addition to those
equations, we have our

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
equilibrium equations.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
And we are going to have two of
these because there are two

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
equilibria that I wrote over
there under titration equations.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:53.000
The first of these is going to
have the equilibrium constant

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Ka, and that is going to be H
three O plus times A

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
minus,
which is acetate in the case of

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.000
acetic acid, all over HA.
That is the expression for the

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
equilibrium of acetic acid
ionization in dilute aqueous

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
solution.
And I will give you a value for

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.000
this in a moment.
I won't write it right here.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Well, why don't I just do that.
It is 1.8x10^-5 for this

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.000
specific example of acetic acid.
And then, if you were working

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.000
with some other weak acid,
you would be able to go to a

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
table and look up the Ka value
for it, if it has been measured

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.000
and reported and tabulated.
And then, we have Kw.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000
And this is the equilibrium
expression for the

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000
autoprotolysis reaction that I
mentioned over there,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000
the other equilibrium,
which is H three O plus times

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:06.000
OH minus.
And that is equal to 1x10^-14,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
so a very small equilibrium
constant.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
And some of you may be
wondering why water is not

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000
appearing in an expression like
this one or like this one.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
And the reason for this is that
in the expressions that I am

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
deriving here,
we are using concentrations in

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
place of activities for these
species.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
In the derivation of the
equilibrium constants,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
the activity of pure water at
very high concentration is

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:46.000
approximated as one.
And so, this is simplified as

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
shown here.
And having put all these

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
equations together,
what we are going to want to do

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000
is take the following approach.
We are looking at the

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
expression for
electro-neutrality here,

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
the equal number of positively
and negatively charged species

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
in solution.
And I want to get this

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
expression rewritten in terms of
things that I know at any point

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
along the titration curve,
with the exception of the one

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
thing that I want to know,
the pH.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
And the pH we can calculate
easily if we know the H three O

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:32.000
plus concentration.
So, I am going to be seeking to

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
get Na plus,
OH minus,

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
and A minus rewritten
in terms of H three O plus

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
and constants using
the equations that I have up

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
here on the board.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
First, let's attempt to do that
for A minus using this

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Ka expression.
And I am going to rearrange it.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.000
And it is going to be equal to
Ka times HA divided by H three O

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
plus.
But I still have a problem with

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
this expression for A minus
because I am going to

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
need to replace HA with
something that will allow me to

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
get everything in terms of just
H three O plus and

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
constants.
And so, if I look over here at

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
the mass balance equation,
I can use this one and replace

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
HA with HA initial minus
A minus.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Now I have A minus
written in terms of an initial

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.000
concentration of HA itself and
constants.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I need to rearrange this a
little bit.

00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:00.000
I am going to multiply through
by H three O plus so

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:08.000
that I can write A minus times H
three O plus is equal to Ka

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:16.000
times HA initial minus Ka times
A minus.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And hopefully I have done that

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000
right.
And, if so, I will be able to

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:39.000
say that A minus is going to be
equal to Ka times HA initial all

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000
over H three O plus.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Does that look good?
Plus Ka, thank you.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
H3O+ plus Ka.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:15.000
And let's bring
that down here.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
Because now,
I would like to go ahead and

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
make this substitution for the
charge.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
We have our A minus.
The other ones are a little

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
easier.
We now have this equation H

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000
three O plus.
And we were going to replace Na

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:53.000
plus by NaOH initial.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:27:00.000
And we are going to recognize
that we can use the equation for

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:06.000
autoprotolysis to replace
hydroxide with Kw divided by H

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:14.000
three O plus.
And then now we have the A

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:21.000
minus being replaced
by Ka HA initial all over H

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:29.000
three O plus plus Ka.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And at this point,
you have actually done a really

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000
nice thing, because you have
generated a general titration

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:45.000
equation for the titration of
interest in this particular

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
case.
You can see that at any point

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000
along that curve for a given
volume m, we can now stop and

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
walk along in one milliliter
increments.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000
And, in each spot along that
curve, we could go ahead and

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000
solve this equation to get the
value of H three O plus.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
And then we would just have to

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
take the negative log of that,
and we would have the pH at

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
that position.
And we are interested if this

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
type of a model for the
mathematical form of the

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000
titration curve bears any
resemblance to what one sees in

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
reality.
And, if so, one could then be,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
at least for the time being,
until your theory no longer

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
fits, satisfied that you have
accounted for the various

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000
equilibria that could be present
in a system such as the one we

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000
are describing here.
This happens to be a cubic

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000
equation, and it has,
therefore, three roots.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:53.000
And when we solve it at each of
these points along the titration

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
equation, because of the
physically realistic quantities

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.000
that we are going to be
interested in,

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
only one of the roots is
positive.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
We are talking about H three O
plus concentration.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000
It cannot be a negative
concentration.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
The positive root is the one we
want, and then we can convert

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
that to pH and can see what kind
of result we get.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000
And so, I will show you how we
can do that using a tool

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000
available on Athena.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
First of all,
let me tell you that for the

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000
purposes of doing this,
I am going to replace these

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
various quantities by some
simpler symbols,

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
here.
I am going to go x plus a,

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
a is our NaOH initial,
is equal to (b over x) plus (c

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:35.000
times d) over (x plus d).

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.000
So, I am going to use those
simpler symbols for this

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
equation.
I could rearrange it and show

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000
you how it is a cubic equation,
you set it equal to zero,

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
and then you solve,
and you get the roots.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Just like a quadratic equation
but with another term.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000
And, instead of doing that,
we are just going to leave it

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
in this form,
which is simpler to look at.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
And we are just going to use
that.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:00.000
And so, let's go ahead and
define A.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
That is the initial
concentration of sodium

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000
hydroxide.
We are going to go 0.1.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
And remember I need to get this
in terms of the quantity m here,

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
which is the volume.
And so, I am going to take m,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
minus 20 over m.
And the reason I am doing is

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000
this is I am saying that we have
an 0.1 molar solution of sodium

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:32.000
hydroxide that we are adding.
But there is a dilution factor

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
that you have to take care of.
So, at every value m we are

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
saying that we are starting with
a volume of 20 in the acetic

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000
acid flask at the bottom there
at the beginning.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000
And then we are starting to add
volume units of sodium

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
hydroxide.
And so the volume,

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
m, is increasing.
That is how I take care of

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
that, there.
And then our value of b is Kw,

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000
so that is 1 E minus 14.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
That is for autoprotolysis.
And then we have c,

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
that is our initial
concentration of acetic acid.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
And we happen to have a
dilution factor here,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
too, but it is simpler,
just 20 divided by m.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
And there is that.
And then d, what did I say that

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.000
d was?
d is our equilibrium constant

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
for HA, 1.8 E minus 5.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
There is our acidity constant
for acetic acids.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Now I have the four things in
there that I need,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:46.000
and those are four things that
I know because of the initial

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
conditions that I am defining
for this problem.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And then I am going to define
my equation as being equal to x

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000
plus a is equal to (b over x)
plus (c times d) all over (x

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
plus d).
There is my equation.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
And this nice calculator,
all I have to do,

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000
in principle,
is tell it what the value of m

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000
is.
And then it is going to solve

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000
that cubic equation,
give me back the three roots.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
I take the positive one and I
take the negative log of it,

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:30.000
and then I know the pH at that
value of m.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
I can develop a whole titration
curve based on the equations

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
that we have been discussing.
And so let's choose a value of

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
m here to start with,
and I am going to choose 30.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:45.000
We are starting at 20.
At the very beginning of the

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000
titration, we are at 20.
Let's see what happens at 30

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
given the particular value of m.
Here is what I do.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.000
There may be other ways to do
this.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
I am defining this thing called
the solution set.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Because the solving of that
equation is going to give us

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
three values.
And then I want to be able to

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
pick the one that I want.
We would use sol-set is equal

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
to, we are going to solve that
equation, and we want x,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
which is our H three O plus
concentration.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
And sometimes it chokes.
Let's see what happens.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Sometimes it is a little slow.
But it takes a lot longer if

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
you actually try to work it all
out by hand.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
I have a picture of an image of
this that I grabbed.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
I can show you if this fails on
me.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Don't fail on me.
There we go.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
You can see it got the answer.
And so here is a positive root,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
and then there are two negative
roots to this cubic equation in

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
x.
And I want to find out the pH.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000
When we are up to 30 volume
units, m equals 30.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:13.000
And so, I will define p here as
equal to the negative log base

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
10 of the first of the answers
in my solution set,

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:23.000
sol-set one,
which is the positive x value.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000
And, bingo, there is the pH,
4.745 whatever dot,

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:32.000
dot, dot.
That is now the pH at a volume

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
of 30.
Now, you figure I am starting

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
with 20 volume units of 0.1
molar acetic acid.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.000
And by the time m equals 30
volume units,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
that means I have added ten
volume units of strong base,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
enough to quench half of my
acetic acid.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
And what if I had just only
quenched none of it?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
I can change m now.
Once you have this in here,

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
you don't have to retype these
things.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
I can go back here and say let
m be 20.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:11.000
And, if I do that,
now I am actually at the zero

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
point, before I add any strong
base.

00:36:13.831 --> 00:00:02.870
And there is the pH now,

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
The answer to the expression
that we had at the very end of

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
class last time that was going
to tell us what is the pH of

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
tenth molar acetic acid,
there is the answer,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:33.000
2.87, because that is what we
have when we start.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Now you can see that you could
just go through and use that to

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:46.000
get the pH at any value of m
along this titration curve.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000
And when you do that,
let's show you what the result

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000
is, now what you see here is a
set of data.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
I start at 20.
And I'm going up in single

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
volume units,
21, 22, 23, and 24,

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:09.000
I am showing what the pH is at
each of those choices of m.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000
And I have gone all the way
from 20 to 60.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And you take that data set --

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:51.000
And then you can take a file,
like the one I just showed you,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:00.000
which just had values of m and
corresponding values of pH.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And you can go ahead and just
plot that thing.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
And, when you do that,
you get the form of the

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
titration curve here,
which is the classic form of a

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:12.000
titration curve for titrating a
weak acid with a strong base.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
And you see that here,
m was 20, and we let it

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
increment through all the way up
to 60.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000
And what you see initially,
and you are going to need to

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000
study this one and the other
cases of titration curves that

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000
are in that chapter of your
book, is how the little subtle

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
features differ from one case to
another.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
They do differ.
A much simpler titration curve

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
than this one is obtained if you
titrate a strong acid with a

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
strong base.
This is titration of a weak

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
acid with a strong base.
And you see that initially,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
we have that 2.87 initial pH
value, that it kind of shoots up

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
quickly here at the beginning.
There is a steep rise,

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000
initially.
And then it kind of levels off.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
And in this region here,
the pH is not changing very

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
rapidly at all as you are adding
more sodium hydroxide.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Until you get out here,
and the pH just shoots up.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And you will notice that it is
around where we get to 40.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Because we started with 20 mLs
of tenth molar acetic acid.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
And, when we get out to m
equals 40, we have added 20 mLs

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000
of tenth molar sodium hydroxide.
At that point the pH just

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
shoots up.
And then over here it turns

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
over and just goes kind of
slowly for a minute.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
And it just approaches an
asymptotic limiting value over

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
here on the high pH side of the
scale.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
One thing you will notice here
is that at this point where we

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
have added the same number of
equivalence of sodium hydroxide

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
molecules as we had acetic acid
molecules to start with,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
this occurs over here at
greater than 8.0 pH units rather

00:39:56.000 --> 00:00:07.000
than at the neutral value of

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000
And I would like you to think
about why that might be.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:08.000
And that will be something that
will be covered in recitation,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
but it is important.
If we had derived here today

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
the expression for the titration
of a strong acid with a strong

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
base, then at 40 we would be
right at 7.0,

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
but when we were using this
weak acid, acetic acid,

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
it comes up here over 8.0 pH
units.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
This point where we have added
as many strong base molecules as

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
we started with,
weak acid molecules,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000
is called the equivalence or
the stoichiometric point in the

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
titration.
Moreover, where would your

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
indicator molecule change color?
At what point,

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
at what value of m,
for example?

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
It would be close to there.
It would be because,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
in the case of phenolphthalein,
it changes between right in

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
here.
It might change right around

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
maybe 41 or so.
m equals 41 might be where the

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000
color change from colorless to
pink occurs, for the reasons

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
that we have discussed.
And then right here,

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
it turns out at this value of m
equals 30, the pH is equal to

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
the pKa of acetic acid.
And that is a relationship that

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
I would like you to think about.
And it is a relationship that

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000
comes into play very strongly
when we talk about the

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
preparation of buffer solutions
according to the

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Henderson-Hasselbach equation.
At m equals 30,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
the pH value of the titration
is the pKa of acetic acid,

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000
which is right here at about
4.7 or so.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000
We did that one a moment ago.
We found out what that value

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
was.
And, in plus or minus 1.0 pH

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
units of that,
we have the part of the

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000
titration curve that is called
the buffering region.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.000
In here we have generated a
buffer in situ.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
And buffers help the pH not to
change too much when acids or

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
bases are added in solution.
That is what buffers do.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
They try to help you keep in a
constant pH range because lots

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
of things are dependent upon a
particular pH for proper

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
functioning.
And you know that this is

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:16.000
important in the world's oceans,
it is important in our

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
environment, and it is important
in our bodies.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000
So, the pH considerations for
aqueous solutions are quite

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
important.
And I hope that today I have

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:31.000
been able to give you a nice way
of thinking about some of the

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
math that goes behind a
titration curve.

00:42:33.691 --> 00:42:36.000
Have a nice Halloween.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.120
Let's now consider how
to find the velocity

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.930
of the center of mass of a wheel
that's rolling without slipping

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:12.790
down an inclined plane.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.130
So let's draw a picture.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.320
Here is the wheel that
starts at t equals 0.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.740
And this is an angle phi.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.480
And at some later time
t final, the wheel

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.110
has dropped a distance h
along the incline plane.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.590
And now let's figure
out what is the velocity

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.800
of the center of
mass of the wheel

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.540
when it gets to the bottom.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.740
And we're now going to
apply our energy arguments.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.180
Now the first thing we have to
realize is a very subtle point

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.630
here is that there
can be friction.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.870
And we saw that when a wheel
is rolling without slipping,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.070
there can be static
friction at the contact

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.700
point between the
wheel and the ground.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.520
There is a gravitational force.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.800
And a normal force.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:24.840
Now static friction does no
work because the point is always

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.960
instantaneously at
rest and f dot ds is 0

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.900
because the object is at rest.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.680
And so the ds is 0.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.680
So our static
friction does no work.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.289
And therefore, from
our energy principle

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:49.800
that the external work equals
E final minus E initial,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.210
we have no external work and
so our energy is constant.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.759
Now how do we
analyze our energy?

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.120
Well, I've set things up.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.370
So I'm going to choose my
potential energy to be 0

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:07.380
when it's at the bottom.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.350
And that our initial energy is
only equal to potential energy.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.670
If the wheel has a mass m,
gravitational force down,

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.060
the potential energy
initially is mgh.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:26.160
The final energy is
only kinetic energy.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.310
The wheel is rolling
with omega final.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.670
Its center of mass is moving
with v center of mass final.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.610
And we just saw that
the kinetic energy

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.530
has two contributions; the
translational kinetic energy,

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.320
1/2 m--

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.220
we'll just call
this final squared.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.000
And we'll make that the
final just to make it easier.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.190
And it has the kinetic
energy of rotation.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.060
Now the rolling without
slipping condition

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.760
is that the translational
center of mass speed

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.250
is equal to the
radius of the wheel,

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.440
r, times the angular
speed, omega final.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.320
So I can write E final
as 1/2 of m plus I

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:22.260
cm over r squared times the
final squared, where I'm just

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.690
replacing omega final
equals v final over r.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:34.230
And therefore, that the kinetic
energy by the energy principle

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.900
tells us that E
initial equals E final.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.110
So mgh equals 1/2
times m plus I cn

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.810
over r squared v final square.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:52.500
So we can find that v final is
equal to the square root of 2

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.510
mgh divided by m
plus 1/2 cm r square.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.840
And that is the final
speed of the center

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.110
of mass translational's
velocity of the wheel

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.280
as it dropped a height h.

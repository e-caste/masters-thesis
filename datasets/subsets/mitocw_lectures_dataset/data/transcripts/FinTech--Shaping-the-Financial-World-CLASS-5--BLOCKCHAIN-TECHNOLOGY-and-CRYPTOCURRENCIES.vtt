00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.450
GARY GENSLER: So we've
got a lot to cover,

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.520
but I'm going to start with
a little background about

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.490
the internet and the payment
riddle; something about money,

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.680
which is at the core, really,
of all classes on finance but we

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.950
usually take for
granted; and then Satoshi

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.280
Nakamoto's innovation--
who was Satoshi Nakamoto,

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.340
what is that innovation; a
bit about crypto markets;

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.950
the blockchain
technology use cases--

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.140
and then the core
really is, how to think

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.840
about viability of
those use cases;

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.180
a little touch on central
bank digital currencies;

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:43.930
and ground truths.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.550
So, a lot to cover.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.260
If we don't get
through it all, we

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.330
will talk about
this again when we

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:54.110
talk about payments in class 6.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.910
In terms of some
of the readings,

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.250
I shared with you two write-ups
that were done for a class

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.760
that Neha Narula and I
teach, an online class

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.410
called Cryptocurrency, which
is available through MIT.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.810
And those two write-ups,
the "Economics of Money

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.120
and Technology"--

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.390
I'm sorry, and the
"Responses of Big Finance"

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.070
sort of give you some
of the challenges

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:24.530
and how to think through
these technologies.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.930
Also, the Bank of
International Settlement

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.860
did a review just
earlier in 2020

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.200
about the central
bank digital currency

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.600
space, because so much
is going on there.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.500
And particularly after Facebook
announced their Libra project

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.140
in June of 2019, many central
banks took note and said, wait,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.790
maybe there's
something going on here

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.010
that we too need to do more.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.380
Now, before Facebook
Libra, there

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.130
were many projects the bank--

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.290
one of the world's
largest central banks,

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.840
the Riksbank in
Sweden, was already

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.490
looking at an e-krona project.

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.990
There were other projects.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.690
But all of a sudden, that
Facebook Libra project kicked

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.630
into high gear central
bankers around the globe,

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.140
and particularly
China's look and review

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.080
and announcements around the
Digital Currency Electronic

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.280
Payments Project also
got kicked into gear.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.200
So regardless of
where you come out,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.680
whether blockchain technology,
cryptocurrencies, are getting

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.720
rolled into the stack, rolled
into the technology stack

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.290
of big finance.

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.450
What we can say as of 2020,
what's really the case,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.420
is that cryptocurrencies
and blockchain technology

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.150
have at least been a
catalyst for change,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.410
an important catalyst for
change pushing upon big finance,

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.320
pushing upon central
banks to reconsider

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.210
how they do payments, how
they do the basics of money.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.160
And I laid out a few questions.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.255
Again, Romain will
look for some hands.

00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:01.630
We're going to keep this a
little shorter than we usually

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.820
do, just because we have
so much to cover, but,

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.800
how does Bitcoin fit into
the history of money?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.910
What are the strategic and
tactical considerations

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.540
assessing viability
and value propositions?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.220
And how are these
central banks thinking

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.450
about what they're doing?

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.660
And Romain, if we can just
see if we could get one or two

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.368
people in kind of each of
these three questions--

00:03:23.368 --> 00:03:24.910
and these are the
essential questions

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.458
I'm going to try to cover
in the next hour or so.

00:03:27.458 --> 00:03:28.000
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.725
Sounds good.

00:03:28.725 --> 00:03:30.100
Who would like to
get us started?

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.290
I'm watching for
your blue hands.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.550
GARY GENSLER: Quiet day today.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.410
AUDIENCE: If you wish, Gary,
I'm also happy to cold call.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.410
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:48.570
Well, I'm going to start.

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:50.280
I'm going to kind of just go.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.980
But I hoped that
everyone would come in.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.880
I start with this scene--

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.680
and I don't know anyone who
wants to raise a blue hand

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.840
and tell me what movie
this is from and the era.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:08.250
But this is the opening scene
of a movie from the mid 1990s,

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.040
The Net, 1995, Sandra Bullock.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:18.029
Now, I start with this, because
Pizza Net was actually real.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:24.050
Now, this cyber security
sort of spy thriller

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.680
with Sandra Bullock sort of
cracking through the computer

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.280
network--

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.990
remember, let's place this.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.540
Mid 1990s.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:38.420
It was only the early 1990s
that Tim Berners-Lee, associated

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:43.430
with MIT, actually came
up with the protocols that

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.930
connects the world wide web.

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.930
The internet had been
around for some time,

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.270
coming out of DARPA and
the Department of Defense

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.800
in the US and
academic institutions.

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.340
But by the early
'90s, it was actually

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.200
something that those
of us in the public

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.110
could use beyond universities,
beyond the defense

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.030
establishment and the like.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.610
But what hadn't
been solved, what

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.700
hadn't been solved
by 1995, was how

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.150
to move money on the internet.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.720
And Pizza Hut founded something
called Pizza Net, which

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.290
is thought to be the
first commercial use where

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.630
you could actually
order something online--

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.880
just 25 years ago--
order something

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.050
online through Pizza Net.

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.720
There was only sort
of one problem.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.360
You ordered the
pizza, and guess what?

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.130
You couldn't pay online.

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.760
Nobody had figured
out how to pay online.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.670
You had to have the pizza
delivery at your door,

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:39.270
and you paid.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:40.200
So just think.

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.720
It's in the middle of
the corona lockdown,

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:44.850
we're sheltering at home.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.730
And if it weren't for these
inventions of 25 years ago

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.540
we're about to discuss, you
would be paying for that pizza

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.600
at the door when the
delivery truck arrived,

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.620
or for your groceries, or
for any other household

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.370
goods that you have.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:05.280
So this riddle, what I call the
payments riddle, what others

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.940
call the payments
riddle, was at the core

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.130
of this new technology,
the internet.

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.240
Now, the internet has been fully
adopted into the technology

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.810
stack of finance by now.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:22.390
But in the mid 1990s, it
was, in essence, fintech.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:24.970
But the question is how to
move value on the internet,

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:30.370
to do it securely, efficiently,
and really importantly,

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:35.270
similar to the packets of
data that move on the internet

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.410
as packets of data,
and thus peer-to-peer.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:41.690
So the internet doesn't
really have central control.

00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.240
All the data that we're
live streaming right now

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.240
between and amongst us, between
78 participants on this Zoom

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.930
meeting right now,
is through packets

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:56.420
of data that's not through
one central control,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:00.920
even though we think, well, Zoom
might be controlling all this.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:03.080
But the challenge really
was, how could you

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.340
prohibit double spending?

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.310
How could you send a packet
of data to one person

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:09.980
and ensure that
that packet of data

00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.390
wasn't also sent to another,
in essence, double spending?

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:16.790
Having some data
like an email that we

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:18.470
might send to two people--

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.750
they were both reading
the same email,

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:23.750
they don't know that each
are reading the same email.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.730
So that was this
payments riddle--

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.440
secure, efficient
packets of data,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.350
but avoiding double spending.

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:33.470
Lots of challenges,
lots of attempts.

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.390
And there were
dozens of attempts.

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:37.970
Somebody even went to
go in to get patents

00:07:37.970 --> 00:07:41.040
and started businesses,
raised money.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:44.270
Some of them through the
earlier days of venture capital

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.030
were backed like
CyberCash and DigiCash,

00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:51.860
and E-gold, B-Money,
all of these failed.

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:54.770
All of them, and
dozens more beyond what

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:59.000
I list here in the 1990s,
and the hurdles were, well,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.520
of course the same hurdles
that any startup would

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:05.150
have around merchant adoption--

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.320
would the stores
actually adopt it--

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.900
but this issue of
double spending.

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.600
And the only sort of
solution to double spending

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:16.340
was using centralization.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:20.810
There was one central computer,
one central controller,

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:23.090
to avoid the double spending.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.270
Or the other side of it,
how did you form consensus?

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:29.870
If you didn't have a
central controller,

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:33.530
how to form consensus on
the say of who had the money

00:08:33.530 --> 00:08:35.190
and who didn't have the money.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:38.809
So this sort of central
payments riddle,

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:42.110
a big issue in the
1990s, attracted

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.800
the interest of a
cryptography group

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.110
called the cypherpunk community.

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.140
I kid you not, it's called
cypherpunk community.

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.170
It was an email list that
had started in the late 1980s

00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:56.460
and had gone on for some time.

00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:02.210
And so there were early
digital solutions that

00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:03.710
were a little bit different.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:06.470
And some of the cryptography
that was brought to it

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:10.020
was not brought from the
cypherpunk community,

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.800
it was brought to bear from
great cryptographers, some

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.830
of them at MIT, some
elsewhere, that came together

00:09:16.830 --> 00:09:19.150
by 1996 with a solution.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.430
It's this updated today the
same solution we use now--

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:27.360
secure socket layer and
transport layer security.

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.610
These two protocols, on hop
of Tim Berners-Lee protocols

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:36.450
about the world wide web from
four or five years earlier.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:38.610
These are the main protocols--

00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:40.770
there are many others
that were added.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:43.050
But these are the main
protocols that allowed

00:09:43.050 --> 00:09:44.850
us to secure the internet.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.150
It's how we do it right now--

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.340
a transfer of data
that's secured

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.800
by the use of cryptography.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.890
And what did that lead to?

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:58.110
That led to a lot
of things where

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.700
we could accept Visas and
MasterCard, American Express,

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.550
by the mid 1990s.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:09.750
Amazon, eBay were
both formed in 1995.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:13.410
It's a founder's dream
to get formed right when

00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.110
a technology is transitioning.

00:10:15.110 --> 00:10:18.450
If Amazon, if Jeff Bezos
had been formed in 1992,

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:21.720
would it still have
been around by 1996

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.770
when the secure socket
layer and the cryptography

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.170
was there for him to get going?

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:32.430
If Jeff Bezos had decided
to form it in 1998 or '99,

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:33.930
it might have been too late.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.870
Now, there's a lot
of things that Amazon

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:37.460
got right and Visa's got right.

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:40.650
But I'm saying timing was
one that was remarkable.

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:43.750
PayPal came along in 1998.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:46.740
And interestingly, the
first mobile payments

00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:51.420
was actually Ericsson teaming
up with Telenor in 1999.

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.062
Now, that product is
not around today--

00:10:54.062 --> 00:10:55.770
or maybe somebody will
correct me and say

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.250
there's still a little bit.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.190
But one of the early
ones that really took off

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:03.510
was Alipay and then
M-Pesa in Kenya.

00:11:03.510 --> 00:11:08.640
Now, All of this still
left the payments riddle.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.510
That payments riddle
was still there

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.130
to some in that
cypherpunk community.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.980
Now, the internet could
get commercialized,

00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:18.750
the internet could move on.

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:21.660
We had this way
through cryptography

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:23.670
to secure payments.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.410
But there was still
this question.

00:11:26.410 --> 00:11:30.100
And it goes to the
heart of, what is money?

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.310
And so I'm going to turn a
little bit to chat about money,

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.258
but just see if Romain
has any questions so far.

00:11:37.258 --> 00:11:38.550
AUDIENCE: Nobody at the moment.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.390
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.250
So I'd like to go back in time.

00:11:41.250 --> 00:11:47.697
I'd like to go back 2,300, 2,400
years in talking about money.

00:11:47.697 --> 00:11:49.530
It's not the first time
money was discussed,

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:51.270
because money was
really an invention

00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:54.210
of humankind thousands
of years before that.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.510
But I'd like to go back
to Plato and Aristotle.

00:11:57.510 --> 00:11:59.880
Plato did not write
extensively on money.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:03.510
But what he did
write is interesting.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:05.730
It's that money is
a symbol devised

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.290
for the purpose of exchanges.

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:09.720
To think, you and I were
going to exchange something--

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:13.050
at the time, maybe it
was a goat for wheat,

00:12:13.050 --> 00:12:16.890
maybe I needed the goat today,
you needed the wheat tomorrow--

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:20.790
but we can use this
symbol, as Plato wrote,

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:23.160
as a purpose of that exchange.

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:26.700
And interestingly,
separately Plato wrote--

00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.540
Plato wasn't in for using
gold and silver for money.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.430
Now, this is
interesting in contrast

00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:34.550
to Plato's student, Aristotle.

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:37.420
Now, Aristotle wrote
extensively about money.

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.220
It seemed like Aristotle wrote
extensively about many things,

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:43.650
but one of them was money.

00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:45.960
And Aristotle wrote
that it solves

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.780
the problem of
commensurability--

00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:50.950
the same sort of issue that
Plato was grappling with,

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.040
commensurability.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:57.060
You need rice, you need
grains, I need goats.

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:00.584
How do we have some
commensurability between that?

00:13:00.584 --> 00:13:03.960
Or the second point here,
money is a guarantee

00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:07.150
that we have what we
want in the future.

00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:09.900
So this is sort of a
time commensurability.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.210
I need something today, you
need something tomorrow.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:19.620
So these two forms of marrying
up needs and wants and values--

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:24.690
Aristotle talked also
as a philosopher about,

00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:27.000
what is values?

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.660
And then talked about
four absolute values.

00:13:30.660 --> 00:13:32.940
Now, I hate to disagree
with Aristotle.

00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.940
But, you know, over
time, there are

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.460
many of Aristotle's
great writings that

00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:40.890
have been challenged--
about the Earth and about

00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:45.060
the solar system, about the
heavens, the skies, the bodies.

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:48.090
So why not say that maybe
Aristotle didn't quite

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.320
have it right about money?

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.740
He talked about durability,
portability, divisibility.

00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:54.910
I still sort of agree.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:58.360
And most monetary economists
would agree on that.

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.510
It's this fourth point--
did it have intrinsic value?

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.135
I find myself more
associated with Plato, who

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.730
had said it was just a symbol.

00:14:06.730 --> 00:14:08.740
It's but a symbol.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:11.770
And so today when we
think about money,

00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.810
we often think of six
key characteristics.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.840
Is it durable,
portable, divisible?

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:20.050
These were--
Aristotle seemed to--

00:14:20.050 --> 00:14:23.320
2,300 years later people
still tend to agree.

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:28.600
But rather than intrinsic value,
that it's uniform, acceptable,

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.930
and stable we'll talk
a little bit more

00:14:31.930 --> 00:14:35.830
about that when we get to the
economics of cryptocurrencies.

00:14:35.830 --> 00:14:38.440
But remember, instead
of intrinsic value,

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.890
that it's uniform; that it's
the same unit of account

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:46.150
within some local
or national economy;

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.430
that others accept it, because
if others don't accept it,

00:14:49.430 --> 00:14:56.270
how can I know that that which I
take today I can use tomorrow?;

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.000
and then its value is stable.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.380
And we think over the
last 300-plus years

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.920
about institutions
that help ensure

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:10.940
that currency value is stable,
we call them central banks.

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.940
So instead of an
intrinsic value, that we

00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:16.990
humans create some form of
acceptability, uniformity,

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.940
and stability.

00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:21.570
Questions?

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:24.380
AUDIENCE: None so far, but I'll
give our students a few seconds

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.570
to raise their hand
if they want to.

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:28.720
Yes, we have a
question from Hassan.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:30.410
GARY GENSLER: Please, Hassan.

00:15:33.635 --> 00:15:34.760
AUDIENCE: Hello, professor.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:40.100
Yeah, my question
is, when you said

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:46.440
that people could exchange
things for other things

00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:46.940
as a mean.

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:51.880
So I mean, how could
the cryptocurrency

00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.210
survive if there is no
intrinsic value in it

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.190
and it's so volatile?

00:15:57.190 --> 00:15:59.770
And when you said that
central banks make

00:15:59.770 --> 00:16:04.500
sure that these currencies
are stable, it's because--

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.960
like for instance, in my
country the central bank

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.680
has to have gold
and other currencies

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:19.340
to support our currency,
our local currency.

00:16:19.340 --> 00:16:25.030
So I'm just baffled to see like
someone speak about, well, you

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:27.340
know what, it's only a symbol.

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:30.190
OK, I know that it
is a symbol, but it

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:32.250
has to have some value in it.

00:16:32.250 --> 00:16:34.210
Otherwise, the other
party would not

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:38.390
accept it as a means of
exchange, if that makes sense.

00:16:38.390 --> 00:16:41.330
GARY GENSLER: So Hassan
is associating himself

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.310
more with Aristotle
than Plato, and I

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:47.250
find myself more associated
with Plato than Aristotle.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:48.740
So this is a worthy
debate that's

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:52.700
gone on for well over a
couple of thousand years.

00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:56.330
But when I say that it
doesn't have intrinsic value,

00:16:56.330 --> 00:16:59.400
and it's more about uniformity,
acceptability, instability,

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.800
think about--

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.420
I'll take the US dollar.

00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:05.910
I don't know-- what
you're country?

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.839
AUDIENCE: I'm from Bahrain.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:09.339
GARY GENSLER: So
I'm not as familiar

00:17:09.339 --> 00:17:11.079
with your central bank.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:15.520
But let's take the US
dollar instead of Bahraini.

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.980
If you walk into
the Federal Reserve,

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:22.480
the US Federal Reserve, and
you have $100 bill-- you know,

00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:25.470
paper currency, $100--

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:26.963
what will they give you?

00:17:26.963 --> 00:17:29.130
I mean, other than that
they would probably send you

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:31.980
on your way and the
security guard would say,

00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:34.170
we're in this
coronavirus period,

00:17:34.170 --> 00:17:35.580
nobody's allowed
in the building.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:39.060
But what would they
do if you showed up

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:43.500
at the New York Federal
Reserve or the Richmond Federal

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:48.630
Reserve, and you said, I
want something for this $100?

00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:52.490
AUDIENCE: I suppose
that a few years ago

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:55.152
that they would give you like
gold, if that makes sense.

00:17:55.152 --> 00:17:55.860
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:58.900
So we got rid of that in 1933.

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:01.830
So "a few years ago" would
be like at the beginning

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.460
of the Great Depression under
President Roosevelt. What

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.130
would they give you in 2020?

00:18:08.130 --> 00:18:13.080
AUDIENCE: They would give me,
I think, the government's--

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.350
that the government
basically would support

00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.918
this piece of paper, I assume.

00:18:22.918 --> 00:18:25.210
GARY GENSLER: So you're
getting at the government which

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:29.240
sort of insure, through
its means and methods,

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:33.110
that it's acceptable
by other citizens,

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:34.880
and it's acceptable
by the government.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:35.790
How do they do that?

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:38.270
They say, well, we'll
take it for US taxes.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:40.820
We'll take it for
Bahranian taxes.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.820
And in most economies,
the governments

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.890
are anywhere from
a quarter to a half

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:48.890
of the economy in some
way, so they will accept it

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:50.690
for a government.

00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.420
They'll ensure that other
people accept it through what's

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.130
called legal tender laws.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:59.930
Through the coercive power
of the state, they will say,

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.100
others must accept it.

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.760
And this is not a new thing.

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.590
Genghis Khan was
doing this in China,

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:08.000
and it was pretty coercive.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.880
It was kind of [CLICKS TONGUE]
the coercive power

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.360
of the state, you must
accept the official currency.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.640
So acceptability can be
accepted by the government.

00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:19.670
It could be
acceptability that others

00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:23.910
must accept it for all
debts, public and private.

00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:27.290
And they can work on stability
and form central banks

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.490
to ensure that-- now, what
does it mean by stability?

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:35.150
It means addressing the
official sector to the supply

00:19:35.150 --> 00:19:37.070
and pricing of money.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.920
Supply and pricing--
the supply we

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:42.740
talk about the monetary
supply, the pricing

00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:44.620
is through interest rates.

00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.470
But can you go into
the US Central Bank,

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.380
can you go into Bahrain
and actually get gold?

00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:49.880
No.

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.860
You can go in and
get a $100 bill,

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:54.260
and they might
give you five 20's.

00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.800
If you really want,
they'll give you 100 1's.

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.110
But you still have
just a physical piece

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.350
of paper or a digital
representation

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.210
that I would contend--

00:20:05.210 --> 00:20:06.770
I'm sort of with Plato--

00:20:06.770 --> 00:20:08.330
it's just a symbol.

00:20:08.330 --> 00:20:11.780
It's a symbol that
our society, no matter

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:15.020
whether it's small or
big, has come together.

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:18.110
And it represents
a store of value.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:21.710
It represents a
means of exchange.

00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:26.450
But it frankly doesn't have
intrinsic value the way

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:27.920
Aristotle talked about it.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:33.540
It has only value because we
humans place a value on it.

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:37.410
But Hassan, are you on
still on the other side?

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:41.360
You feel gold has
intrinsic value.

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:42.350
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:46.160
I think because
it's a scarce metal.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.480
And I know that prices
could go up and down,

00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.380
but still I know that
I could sell it one day

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.020
and get money or get--

00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:59.920
GARY GENSLER: So gold is
what we now call an element.

00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.670
It's on the periodic table.

00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:07.240
It's got great attributes
because it's scarce.

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.310
It takes a lot of
human resources

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:11.480
to get it out of the ground.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.240
The other thing about gold,
it's divisible, it's portable,

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:15.850
it's uniform.

00:21:15.850 --> 00:21:19.620
It doesn't oxidize, so it's
a really good base sort

00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.790
of element in that way as well.

00:21:22.790 --> 00:21:26.140
And now we have, give
or take, 10,000 years

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.580
of acceptability, that it's
a human shared narrative.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.190
Some of it not good,
some of it about war,

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:38.060
and slavery, and all sorts of
challenges in human history.

00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.080
But gold, and to a
lesser extent silver,

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:44.290
were very acceptable and stable.

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:46.000
But think about
this for a moment.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.780
All the world's gold
that's ever been mined,

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.870
if you take all of
that gold, it can fit

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:56.090
in four Olympic-sized pools.

00:21:56.090 --> 00:21:59.300
Four Olympic-sized pools,
you. could put all that gold

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:01.130
into one space.

00:22:01.130 --> 00:22:03.730
Now, it's spread
around the world

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:06.500
in jewelry and secure vaults.

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.500
But it's only four
Olympic-sized pools.

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.620
I would kind of contend
that's just a symbol.

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:19.630
Again, it has some kind of
features that make it durable,

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:23.560
and it's got 10,000
years of human narrative

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.360
and acceptability.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.950
And I can assure
you that those who

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:32.980
are really in times of
trouble would probably

00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.780
take a piece of gold--

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:38.830
if it was really in
times of war and despair,

00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:42.253
take a piece of
gold over Bitcoin.

00:22:42.253 --> 00:22:43.670
But on the other
hand, we're going

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:45.550
to get into what
Bitcoin is and how

00:22:45.550 --> 00:22:49.610
it creates some digital
scarce store of value.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.810
So Hassan, we could keep
going with a lively debate,

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.990
but I hope that helps at least
frame the sides of this thing.

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just
have one thing to say.

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:05.230
Now, I mean, if the US
for some reason collapsed,

00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:08.140
what would happen to the
whole monetary system?

00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:11.860
I mean, it's very dangerous,
if that makes sense.

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:12.460
Because--

00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:14.710
GARY GENSLER: You're asking
what happens if a nation's

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:15.970
currency collapses.

00:23:15.970 --> 00:23:18.380
And we have history of that.

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:20.950
We don't have
recent history when

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.770
a world's dominant
currency collapses,

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:26.440
but we've certainly a
history of many countries'

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.490
currencies collapsing.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:31.780
In fact, right now Venezuela's
currency basically collapses.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:35.410
And what happens in countries
that where the currencies enter

00:23:35.410 --> 00:23:37.960
hyperinflation and
start to collapse,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.910
you start to see communities
reach out to another symbol,

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:48.580
some other symbol that is
acceptable and has stability.

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:51.790
It might be in the common
time, in the current time,

00:23:51.790 --> 00:23:54.980
that those people will
reach out to the US dollar.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.130
And your question is, what
if the dollar collapses?

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:00.850
But in monetary history
serves that usually

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:04.920
that when a currency goes
bad, people reach out

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.820
to the better currency.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:09.900
And it could be a
neighboring country.

00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.990
It could be a different
metal, like when

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:16.980
we had challenges between
different base metals,

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:20.220
or even earlier
times, when we had

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:23.310
money that looked a little
different than we currently

00:24:23.310 --> 00:24:26.250
looked like.

00:24:26.250 --> 00:24:29.160
Let me hold that about what
happens to the US dollar

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.140
for a moment and
just say, the role

00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.090
of money, because
we will lose time,

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:35.500
and I want to get going
as to what cryptocurrency

00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:37.660
and blockchain technology is.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.080
So the role of money
is three things--

00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.630
a medium of exchange,
as Plato and Aristotle

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:46.380
talked about; a store of
value, that Aristotle basically

00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.830
said that I can hold it today
for something tomorrow-- that's

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:55.200
a store of value; and it also
then becomes a unit of account.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:58.140
The US dollar is a unit
of account in the US,

00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:04.170
the yen in Japan, the euro
in Europe, a unit of account.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.840
These three roles of money.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.880
And it's looked very
different over time.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.430
Cowrie shells in Greece.

00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:15.860
But today, I put here
an Alipay mobile wallet.

00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:21.760
That's sort of what we use
dominantly around the world.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.390
We talked a little bit
about fiat currency

00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:27.570
when Hassan and I were
going back and forth.

00:25:27.570 --> 00:25:31.350
A fiat currency is
a representation

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:35.340
of some central bank liability.

00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:39.630
Central banks, an invention
of the late 17th century

00:25:39.630 --> 00:25:42.810
both in England and
in Sweden, just about

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:46.410
the same decade in
the late 17th century,

00:25:46.410 --> 00:25:47.880
was a check on the sovereign.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.100
You see the king,
the king in England--

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.990
using that story for a moment--

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.440
the king was at yet
another war with France

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.920
and wanted to borrow money.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:00.750
And when the king
wanted to borrow money,

00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:02.880
going to the noble
lords, the noble lords

00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:06.450
said, enough already,
king, and said, we

00:26:06.450 --> 00:26:12.490
need some mechanism to control
how much you can borrow.

00:26:12.490 --> 00:26:15.010
And how much you can
borrow is, in essence,

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.260
a representation of money.

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.300
And they set up the
Bank of England.

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:23.117
And in Sweden it was a
check also on the sovereign

00:26:23.117 --> 00:26:24.950
for a little bit different
political reasons

00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:27.150
than a war with France.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:30.500
And there we had the initial
sort of central banks.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.320
Here in the US we
went about it--

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.960
Alexander Hamilton thought
we should have something.

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:41.600
That was during the 1790s.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.300
By the 1830s,
Andrew Jackson said,

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:47.000
enough with this sort
of centralized banking.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.620
And then we went for nearly
80 years-- about 75 years,

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.170
from the 1830s to the 19-teens--

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.720
with no central bank.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.050
We had crisis after
crisis, and we formed one

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:03.200
during President
Wilson's time, one

00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:09.380
of the great progressive
movements of the day and just

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.390
about a hundred years ago.

00:27:11.390 --> 00:27:15.310
But fiat currencies are
representations of liabilities.

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:17.060
And Hassan would say,
well, but don't they

00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.490
have something behind it?

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:23.420
What they have behind it
is the government's ability

00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.810
to, of course, tax, the
government's ability

00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:30.530
to be trusted to keep
its promises to keep

00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.390
that currency stable.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.510
But again, just like when
that English king was

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.300
at war with France, sometimes--

00:27:38.300 --> 00:27:41.270
sometimes-- they
overprint the money.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:46.520
Sometimes it gets out of control
and central banks lose control.

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:51.020
But it has very big network
effects that we talked about.

00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:54.830
The acceptance for
taxes for legal tender,

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.490
it's accepted through
what Mundell would say

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:00.950
was an optimum currency area.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:04.310
Now, we have 180 currencies
around the globe.

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:07.610
And some work well and
some don't work so well,

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:10.510
like Venezuela right now.

00:28:10.510 --> 00:28:12.660
And so in the midst
of all of that,

00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.900
the question is, and
this a little humorous,

00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.960
is, what's money's future?

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.670
Is it digital currencies?

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:23.650
Or is it like in kind of
the fun movie Star Wars,

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:28.900
is it these types of things,
credit chips and the like?

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.610
Now, I would say if
you're a Star Trek

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.550
fan, in Star Trek Gene
Roddenberry didn't

00:28:33.550 --> 00:28:34.660
have any currency.

00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.030
If you go through
all the original Star

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:40.210
Treks and everything, they
actually didn't have any money.

00:28:40.210 --> 00:28:43.940
That was Gene
Roddenberry's future.

00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:48.120
So he sort of dispensed with
all this Plato and Aristotle--

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:50.350
Let's now sort of go a
little bit more serious

00:28:50.350 --> 00:28:52.560
and then talk about
Satoshi Nakamoto.

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:56.440
But Romain, any questions?

00:28:56.440 --> 00:28:57.370
AUDIENCE: None so far.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:58.537
Let's give it a few seconds.

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:05.610
No, I think we're good to go.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:07.193
GARY GENSLER: So
with that foundation,

00:29:07.193 --> 00:29:09.770
let's go back to
the payments riddle.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:11.900
So we get through the 1990s.

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.790
The internet is taking off, we
figure out how to secure it,

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:21.830
and the credit card companies
find a way to move money.

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:23.290
Some startups happen.

00:29:23.290 --> 00:29:26.150
PayPal and the like
start up in this area,

00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:28.820
the fintech of the late 1990s.

00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:31.640
Mobile payments
start by the noughts.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:39.310
We already have Alipay
and M-Pesa in Africa.

00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:41.260
But this payment
riddle is still there.

00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:44.770
And that cypherpunk mailing
list is still there.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:50.000
And on Halloween night in
2008, an eight-page paper

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.330
is written and is put up on
the internet on this cypherpunk

00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:57.400
punk mailing list-- there
might only be a couple people.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.940
"I've been working on a new
electronic cash system."

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:05.520
Peer-to-peer, no trusted third
party, no central authority.

00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.060
And what Satoshi Nakamoto wrote
in that eight-page paper, what

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:16.600
Nakamoto-san wrote was
Bitcoin white paper.

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.970
Had never used the word
"blockchain technology."

00:30:18.970 --> 00:30:21.490
We've come to call it
blockchain technology.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.460
So, what is the
blockchain technology?

00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:28.840
fundamentally, it's a
shared accounting system--

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:33.110
a shared accounting system
or a shared database system.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:37.690
So Satoshi Nakamoto had
timestamped ledgers.

00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:43.380
And a timestamped ledger with
cryptography to secure it

00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:44.700
was not new.

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:49.780
A timestamped ledger-- my
little illustration here,

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.920
Neha Narula and I use this,
so I want to give her credit

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.200
as well--

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.600
represents blocks of data.

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.840
Blocks of data, and between
these blocks of data

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.030
a cryptographic hash function.

00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.710
And a cryptographic
hash function

00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:07.470
we use every day
of our lives, just

00:31:07.470 --> 00:31:10.920
we don't know we're using
it, somewhere on the internet

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:13.190
to commit to data.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:18.540
This technology, this idea
of taking a block of data

00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.670
and adding another
block of data and having

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.970
a hash function in
between, was an innovation

00:31:23.970 --> 00:31:26.380
of the late 1980s.

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:29.700
Two Bell Labs scientists,
Haber and Stornetta,

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:32.760
wrote a paper about it,
even started a company

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:37.170
to notarize legal
documents by 1995,

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:40.200
a little startup called Surety.

00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:41.940
That existed.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:45.030
That existed, but what
Nakamoto-san figured out

00:31:45.030 --> 00:31:48.300
was how to have
multiple parties.

00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:51.680
Nakamoto-san solved
the consensus riddle,

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:55.860
or what some people call
Byzantine general's problem.

00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:00.880
The problem is, what if I don't
know the other people keeping

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.950
a ledger?

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:05.250
Again, the Byzantine
general's problem was not new.

00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:06.420
It wasn't even about money.

00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:08.460
The Byzantine general's
problem had been written

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:10.200
about in the early 1980s.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:13.080
It was a computer
systems problem.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:16.770
If you tie various computers
together, what if one of them

00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:17.370
fails?

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:20.850
Or even in an airplane, what
if one of the engines fails?

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.540
It's the question
of fault tolerance.

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.120
But what Satoshi Nakamoto
did was solved it

00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.480
through something
called proof of work.

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:33.240
And we don't have the time
to go through that, but what

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:38.280
this provided together was
a decentralized, auditable

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:39.450
database.

00:32:39.450 --> 00:32:42.630
Now, in the case of
Bitcoin 10,000 computers

00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:47.040
around the globe maintain
this auditable database.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.620
And this audible
database builds a block

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:53.640
of data on top of a block of
data on top of a block of data,

00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:59.550
but its shared accounting
system maintains it.

00:32:59.550 --> 00:33:03.090
There was one other thing that
went on in this period time.

00:33:03.090 --> 00:33:08.550
In the late 1990s, a
computer scientist Nick Szabo

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.180
wrote a paper and coined the
phrase "smart contracts."

00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:13.950
Again, not an original idea.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:16.110
But what Nick Szabo
said, what if we

00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:21.760
could take a set of promises,
put them in digital form,

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.600
and then the parties can
perform against them?

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:29.200
In essence, what if we
automate in computer

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:32.050
code the movement
of a property right?

00:33:32.050 --> 00:33:34.030
Now, I grew up in
Baltimore, Maryland.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.040
My dad had a vending
machine business.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:43.600
You know, cigarette machines
and candy machines and the like.

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.430
A vending machine
is a smart contract.

00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.890
It's a conditional movement
of property rights.

00:33:48.890 --> 00:33:53.030
It's a pack of gum if you put
some money in the machine.

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.040
So you can think
of a smart contract

00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:58.940
as digitizing, basically,
a vending machine.

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.400
They're not necessarily
smart, they're not necessarily

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:02.350
legal contracts.

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.680
So I'd be cautious about that.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:08.480
But these two concepts came
together-- smart contracts,

00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.760
meaning, can I digitize the
movement of a property right?

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:17.940
And then this accounting
system of a shared ledger,

00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:21.100
that multiple parties
can share a ledger

00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:23.860
with no central controller.

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.120
That's kind of the
conceptual frame where

00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.040
I want to pause for
a second, Romain,

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:36.340
and take questions
on what I usually

00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:38.739
cover in a lot more time
than the few minutes

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:39.670
that I just did.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.580
AUDIENCE: Any questions
from the students?

00:34:48.179 --> 00:34:49.929
GARY GENSLER: This
must be because we just

00:34:49.929 --> 00:34:56.658
went through holiday time and
we had our Zoom Easters and Zoom

00:34:56.658 --> 00:34:57.158
seders.

00:35:00.365 --> 00:35:02.032
AUDIENCE: There are
no hands raised now.

00:35:02.032 --> 00:35:04.710
Ah, we do have one
question from Celi.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:07.063
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:35:07.063 --> 00:35:08.480
AUDIENCE: So I was
just wondering,

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:12.410
can you explain a
little more the issues

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:15.920
of the decentralized
audible database?

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:19.640
You mentioned it very briefly
that it first came out

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:21.610
and how [INAUDIBLE] were solved.

00:35:21.610 --> 00:35:25.310
But can you-- just to understand
what issues they are solving.

00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:26.685
Can you kind of
explain a little?

00:35:26.685 --> 00:35:29.660
GARY GENSLER: So if I
understand the question,

00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.790
what Nakamoto-san
was trying to solve

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:37.280
was what has been come to
called double spending.

00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:44.750
Can you in a digital way move
a representation of value,

00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:46.820
in a digital way move
that, without having

00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.890
a central authority?

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:53.210
We move digitally representation
of values every day.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.330
When you go online and buy
something-- you go to Expedia,

00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:01.970
you go to Amazon,
you go to Alibaba--

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:05.330
we move digitally
representation of values.

00:36:05.330 --> 00:36:09.585
We no longer have much of
our economy on physical cash.

00:36:09.585 --> 00:36:14.030
But we always have some
central authority-- a bank,

00:36:14.030 --> 00:36:18.650
a payments company that
we'll talk about in class 6--

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:20.900
some central
authority controlling

00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.380
that to ensure that
you actually have

00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:27.620
that value, to
authenticate and authorize

00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.690
the movement of that money.

00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:31.820
So what Satoshi
Nakamoto was solving

00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:35.210
for is, what if there
was no central authority?

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:39.470
And it was a shared
database or ledger,

00:36:39.470 --> 00:36:42.050
or what I call a shared
accounting system.

00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:45.170
That would be the core thing.

00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:48.380
This kind of riddle
from the 1990s,

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.690
we send packets of data
around the internet

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.260
with this out-of-central
authority,

00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.500
maybe you could do that.

00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.480
And I don't think it's
a surprise this happened

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.050
in the middle of a
financial crisis, Halloween

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.550
in the middle of a
financial crisis,

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:04.100
when trust in central
authorities was quite low,

00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:07.220
and especially trust in
Wall Street and banking,

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.830
and banks in Europe
was quite low.

00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:16.600
This burst of innovation
came at that time.

00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.890
I hope that helps.

00:37:17.890 --> 00:37:20.260
And I think as we're going
to chat through today

00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.730
and in other
classes, the question

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.065
is, are there
other applications?

00:37:24.065 --> 00:37:26.050
See, this goes to
the heart of finance.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:27.820
It goes to the heart
of the plumbing.

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:32.755
Satoshi Nakamoto's innovation
still survives 12 years later.

00:37:32.755 --> 00:37:38.570
In this adversarial sort
of off-the-grid way,

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:42.400
Bitcoins still survives
12 years later.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.850
But are there other
applications in finance,

00:37:45.850 --> 00:37:51.820
where a shared database system,
a shared accounting system

00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:53.720
is the best way to go?

00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:56.200
And we've had
inventions like this,

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.610
infrastructure technologies that
have radically changed finance.

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.610
And one of them from
several hundred years ago

00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:04.900
was the joint stock company.

00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.300
When I talk about
a technology stack,

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.540
one from several
centuries ago was,

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:15.220
can we have a shared
ownership of a company?

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:17.550
And when that was
sort of invented,

00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:20.490
I guess some people would have
said, what do we need that for?

00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:24.990
This, instead of a shared
company, is a shared database.

00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.580
And so that's the debate.

00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:28.530
Is it really needed?

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.900
Will it be useful in the future?

00:38:30.900 --> 00:38:34.830
It has led to a crypto
market, about $200 billion

00:38:34.830 --> 00:38:42.310
as of yesterday, 2/3 of which
is Bitcoin, highly volatile.

00:38:42.310 --> 00:38:45.360
Hassan would say, but
what's the intrinsic value?

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.470
It is a digital
scarce store of value.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:52.470
And it only has value because
somebody else will move it.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.560
When Bitcoin was
rolled out in 2009,

00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.540
nobody saw that it had value.

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:02.490
It was just a kind of
interesting project.

00:39:02.490 --> 00:39:07.050
But by 2010, one person
who was in the community

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:09.840
said, let's see if I could
get anybody to give me

00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:12.450
something commercially.

00:39:12.450 --> 00:39:14.560
And it was actually pizza.

00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.720
It wasn't Pizza Net,
the Sandra Bullock

00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.330
movie we started with in 1995.

00:39:21.330 --> 00:39:27.960
But 15 years later in 2010, a
crypto enthusiast in Florida

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:32.760
put out-- on an email asked,
I will give you 10,000 bitcoin

00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:34.710
if you send me two pizzas.

00:39:34.710 --> 00:39:39.270
Two pizzas, 1,000
bitcoin in May of 2010.

00:39:39.270 --> 00:39:41.730
It took about a week
before anybody responded.

00:39:41.730 --> 00:39:43.980
But two pizzas showed
up at his door,

00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:49.620
and sure enough this crypto
enthusiast in Florida

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.190
sent the 10,000 bitcoin.

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:55.123
Now, at the time, there
wasn't a crypto market.

00:39:55.123 --> 00:39:56.790
At the time, it was
thought that the two

00:39:56.790 --> 00:40:02.130
pizzas were worth about $42 that
he had paid 10,000 bitcoin for.

00:40:02.130 --> 00:40:07.780
That 10,000 bitcoin today would
be valued at about $65 million.

00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.906
So 10 years later,
you kind of go, well,

00:40:10.906 --> 00:40:15.060
that was kind of an
interesting time to do that.

00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.760
It's led to different sectors.

00:40:17.760 --> 00:40:19.770
There's thousands
of these coins.

00:40:19.770 --> 00:40:21.960
The payment or store
of value tokens

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.500
are the dominant, about
3/4 of the market.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.330
Some of you may have
heard of Ethereum.

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:29.630
But platform tokens were--

00:40:29.630 --> 00:40:33.720
Vitalik Buterin rolled out
this thing called Ethereum.

00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:41.170
And Ethereum is conceptually
a worldwide shared computer.

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:48.040
It has many attributes
of operating system.

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:50.170
I wouldn't compare
it and contrasted

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:54.430
with iOS and Android, but it
does have attributes similar

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:59.050
to a worldwide platform
layer operating system,

00:40:59.050 --> 00:41:02.410
upon which distributed
applications or dApps can

00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:04.950
be put on top.

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.870
So this is this ecosystem.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:10.770
There's a few dozen payment
or store value tokens.

00:41:10.770 --> 00:41:12.960
There's dozens of
platform tokens.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:18.220
There's 1,000 to 2,000
applications placed on top.

00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.540
The conceptual framework
in these applications

00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.420
is they're decentralized.

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:28.050
Will anybody use them--
different questions

00:41:28.050 --> 00:41:30.070
along the way.

00:41:30.070 --> 00:41:31.800
So, what has this led to?

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:37.310
It's led to blockchain use cases
around speculative investing.

00:41:37.310 --> 00:41:40.090
Crowdfunding through
initial coin offerings--

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:45.310
from 2017 to 2019,
nearly $30 billion

00:41:45.310 --> 00:41:50.780
was raised by basically
selling a token

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.750
before you had a business.

00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:55.940
You might have a
good idea, you might

00:41:55.940 --> 00:42:00.380
have the legitimate players, and
you raised money off of this.

00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:03.440
You weren't selling equity,
you were not selling debt,

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.080
you were selling a
token that could be used

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.400
on some site in the future.

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.680
Now, those tokens
have largely been--

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.520
in 2020 this is--

00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:17.630
those tokens are largely
for crypto exchanges,

00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.000
for gaming, for
gambling, for something

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:24.090
called decentralized
finance, and file sharing.

00:42:24.090 --> 00:42:26.250
Now, there's something
that's consistent

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:29.010
about the first three--
crypto exchanges, gaming,

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:30.180
and gambling.

00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:34.100
Some of the users of these
gaming/gambling exchange sites

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:38.220
want a sort of a basis
of staying off the grid.

00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:41.190
They want censorship resistance.

00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:43.650
So the thing about
cryptocurrencies,

00:42:43.650 --> 00:42:47.920
the good and the bad sometimes,
is the official sector,

00:42:47.920 --> 00:42:50.670
though they can track some of
it, they can't track all of it.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:54.660
That it's some way sometimes
to stay off the grid.

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.010
I'm not advising this.

00:42:56.010 --> 00:42:59.100
I'm just saying the economics
of it, some of that,

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.560
is about censorship-resistant.

00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:07.910
All of the other uses has been
around blockchain technology.

00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:10.580
And the uses really
are potential uses.

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:11.600
They haven't taken off.

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:13.160
Can we use it in
payment systems?

00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.750
Can we use it in trade finance?

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.420
Can we use it in clearing
settling and processing?

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.330
And there are
hundreds of projects

00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:25.610
that have been in proof of
concept or pilot stages, none

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:28.230
that have truly broken out yet.

00:43:28.230 --> 00:43:32.850
And this is why I say it hasn't
come into the technology stack.

00:43:32.850 --> 00:43:34.960
You can, by the way,
get your MIT diploma

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.710
on blockchain technology.

00:43:36.710 --> 00:43:42.770
I'm saying that if you
do, you can decide also

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.780
to get it in paper form.

00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:48.050
I thought-- Romain, actually we
had a poll just to see how many

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.740
people--

00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:52.490
there's a poll on use of
cryptocurrency or something,

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.530
the first of those two polls.

00:43:55.530 --> 00:44:00.050
If folks don't mind just
giving a little flavor for,

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.215
have you ever owned
crypto, and so forth.

00:44:03.215 --> 00:44:08.780
So it looks like a third have
owned Bitcoin or Ethereum

00:44:08.780 --> 00:44:11.060
or AUT Coins.

00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:13.790
And we have-- does
Bitcoin exhibit

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:17.510
the three roles of money?

00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:22.400
A little over half yes, and
a little less than a half no.

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.340
I'm going to ask if somebody--
one person on the yes side, one

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.050
person on the no
side-- just points

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:31.100
to articulate why
it does not exhibit

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:33.440
the three roles of money--
the store of value,

00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.660
medium of exchange,
unit of account.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:41.100
And for this Romain,
we'll cold call.

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:47.002
So if somebody wants to take
the lead on either side.

00:44:47.002 --> 00:44:48.950
AUDIENCE: Any volunteers?

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:49.831
Camilo.

00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:53.890
GARY GENSLER: And
if you can declare

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.860
which side you're on so somebody
can volunteer on the other side

00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:58.370
as well.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:00.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
am on the no side.

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:00.990
I mean, I--

00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:01.990
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:04.270
So just for a moment, so
if somebody on the optimist

00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:05.980
positive side please volunteer.

00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.588
But Camilo.

00:45:07.588 --> 00:45:08.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah, no.

00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:13.160
I mean, I think that still
as a medium of exchange,

00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:16.460
Bitcoin and the rest
of the cryptocurrencies

00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:18.430
are really limited.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.870
If I want to go to, I
don't know, the public

00:45:20.870 --> 00:45:24.840
and buy something with
Bitcoin, it would be so hard.

00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:26.570
I'll have to find an
app that translates

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:29.960
my Bitcoin to real money
and then try to pay.

00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.580
And there is also a questionable
thing about the store of value.

00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:38.480
You know, Bitcoin at least-- and
Ethereum I think is also true--

00:45:38.480 --> 00:45:42.920
had been fluctuating
so much that you never

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.340
know how much value are you're
getting for a bitcoin day

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:46.870
to day.

00:45:46.870 --> 00:45:50.330
So I think there is still a
long way before fulfilling

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:52.330
the essentials of money.

00:45:52.330 --> 00:45:53.330
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:45:53.330 --> 00:45:57.620
So I think Camilo is saying,
I can't go to Publix,

00:45:57.620 --> 00:46:00.890
not a medium of exchange
where I want to go.

00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:06.420
And it's kind of this
volatile store of value.

00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.630
And you didn't address
a unit of account.

00:46:08.630 --> 00:46:10.220
But let's see if
there's somebody

00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.220
on the other side who just
wants to kind of articulate

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.120
the other side of this.

00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.403
AUDIENCE: We have Devin.

00:46:16.403 --> 00:46:17.570
GARY GENSLER: Devin, please.

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:18.500
AUDIENCE: Oof.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:22.310
I can give the counter,
at least in my opinion.

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:24.980
I don't think that the
idea of a store of value

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:28.190
and the medium exchange are
shortcomings of the currency.

00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:30.440
I think they're shortcomings
of the market in which it

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:32.400
operates.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.583
So you can use it
to exchange value.

00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:36.000
If the infrastructure
isn't there,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.937
that's not the
currencies fault, that's

00:46:37.937 --> 00:46:39.270
sort of the market participants.

00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:42.630
And then with the store of
value, it does store a value.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:44.550
That value does
fluctuate, that's true.

00:46:44.550 --> 00:46:47.070
But again, I think that's
because of the market it's in

00:46:47.070 --> 00:46:52.020
and speculation going on
around these currencies.

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:53.810
GARY GENSLER: Camilo
do you want to--

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:55.180
you both are unmuted.

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:59.200
You can cross-- and Devin
can stay unmuted, too.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:02.615
Any reply just for 30 seconds?

00:47:02.615 --> 00:47:03.490
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:47:03.490 --> 00:47:05.800
I just want to say that,
although it's true that

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:09.010
the value of the Bitcoin, it
fluctuates with the market,

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:14.110
the point is that if you want
a worldwide accepted medium

00:47:14.110 --> 00:47:18.070
of exchange, it cannot
fluctuate as much as a Bitcoin.

00:47:18.070 --> 00:47:19.720
Otherwise, the
financial system--

00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:24.100
and even people who have savings
wouldn't have their savings

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:24.790
in Bitcoin.

00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:26.970
I mean, you are not going
to put your funding,

00:47:26.970 --> 00:47:29.590
your savings account
into Bitcoin,

00:47:29.590 --> 00:47:33.160
because you might get
losses overnight, so.

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.470
GARY GENSLER: And [Devin.

00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:38.127
AUDIENCE: I agree that
it does fluctuate.

00:47:38.127 --> 00:47:39.460
I wouldn't put my savings in it.

00:47:39.460 --> 00:47:42.140
I never have, I never will.

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.750
But I do think it
kind of comes down

00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:46.540
to what is the exact definition
of the question you're

00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.300
trying to answer.

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.460
Can you store value in it?

00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:49.090
Yes.

00:47:49.090 --> 00:47:51.070
Is the value going to
be the same tomorrow?

00:47:51.070 --> 00:47:52.570
Maybe not.

00:47:52.570 --> 00:47:55.220
And that's something that
might stabilize over time as--

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.030
like, if it gets used more
for day-to-day interactions

00:47:58.030 --> 00:48:00.170
like going to the
shop, and it's not

00:48:00.170 --> 00:48:02.650
kind of speculation and
sort of hype around it,

00:48:02.650 --> 00:48:05.140
then maybe we can kind
of converge to a point

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:07.900
where it does satisfy
everything fully.

00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:10.690
GARY GENSLER: And this
debate that Devin and Camilo

00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:14.440
are helping frame is debate
that's a worthy debate.

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:18.280
I will tell you that I'm
not a Bitcoin maximalist,

00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.780
but I actually--

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:22.420
I'm probably a little
closer to Devin than Camilo

00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:27.490
on this in terms of, it is a
digital scarce store of value.

00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:29.950
Will it be worth something
10 years from now?

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:31.960
Maybe not, maybe not.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:35.260
But it has survived
kind of in this swamp,

00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.290
it's this uncertain sort
of world, for 12 years.

00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:45.360
And it has some
value to some folks.

00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.990
Hassan earlier would say, but
it doesn't have intrinsic value.

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:52.730
And I would say, well, it's
just a symbol in any regard.

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:56.850
It can be a medium of
exchange in certain places.

00:48:56.850 --> 00:48:58.250
But it needs an infrastructure.

00:48:58.250 --> 00:49:01.130
Camilo is absolutely right.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:06.430
The state treasurer of Ohio
in late 2018 had announced--

00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:09.260
a state controller, I
think it might have been,

00:49:09.260 --> 00:49:11.150
in Ohio, an elected office--

00:49:11.150 --> 00:49:15.050
that the state of Ohio would
accept Bitcoin for taxes.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:18.080
Was it just for
political reasons

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:20.960
that this gentleman
announced it,

00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:23.150
that he thought he was
associating himself

00:49:23.150 --> 00:49:25.820
with a new innovation
in the economy?

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.230
But they needed
an infrastructure

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:28.850
to accept the Bitcoin.

00:49:28.850 --> 00:49:35.510
They had to convert it for a
1% fee to US dollars for sure.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:37.430
It's not much of
a unit of account.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:41.030
But sometimes it becomes
a unit of account inside

00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:45.770
of these other decentralized
apps inside the ICO space.

00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:49.700
So it sort of probably exhibits
one out of the three mostly.

00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.280
It's a speculative
store of value.

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.110
It can be a medium of exchange.

00:49:54.110 --> 00:49:56.330
It can be a unit of account.

00:49:56.330 --> 00:49:58.400
But it hasn't adopted this.

00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:04.100
A number of years ago, the
Financial Stability Board,

00:50:04.100 --> 00:50:08.540
a worldwide organization of
20-- the G20 finance ministers

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:12.710
and central bankers, decided
that they would no longer call

00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:14.720
Bitcoin and others
cryptocurrencies,

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:16.860
and they'd call
them crypto assets.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:19.370
So they were associating
more with Camilo's side.

00:50:19.370 --> 00:50:20.745
They were saying,
we're not going

00:50:20.745 --> 00:50:24.800
to give this the kind of
word to call it a currency.

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.650
And yet, the US
Department of Treasury

00:50:27.650 --> 00:50:30.530
some seven years ago
had to address itself

00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:32.840
to the question
of whether Bitcoin

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:38.780
and other similar digital assets
were currency under US Bank

00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.710
Secrecy Act laws, against
money laundering and the like.

00:50:43.710 --> 00:50:46.760
And for that purpose,
they said that Bitcoin

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:48.740
was a virtual currency.

00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:52.820
So there's the US Department of
Treasury fitting it into a box.

00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:56.690
Now, I dare say they
needed to somehow address

00:50:56.690 --> 00:50:58.880
this public policy
issue as to whether it

00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:01.970
was going to be regulated
under the Bank Secrecy Act.

00:51:01.970 --> 00:51:04.400
So somehow they had
to call it a currency,

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.440
call it a virtual currency.

00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:08.060
Another part of
the US Department

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:10.370
of Treasury about
the same time said

00:51:10.370 --> 00:51:14.010
it was going to be treated
as property for tax purposes.

00:51:14.010 --> 00:51:17.930
So inside the US
Treasury Department,

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:20.600
clearly for purposes
of trying to decide

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.540
how it's going to be taxed,
how it's going to be treated

00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:27.410
for anti-money laundering
laws, one part of the Treasury

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:29.450
called a virtual
currency, another part

00:51:29.450 --> 00:51:35.510
of the US Treasury called it
property rather than currency.

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:37.440
And that fit into that.

00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:40.070
So I think I'll move
on a little bit.

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:44.030
But we can take down
the poll, I think.

00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:46.300
Or do I do that?

00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:46.800
You--

00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.330
AUDIENCE: So every
person should be

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.520
able to close that
little polling window.

00:51:52.520 --> 00:51:54.400
I do not have control over it.

00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.850
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:59.120
Then I need to do that here
for a second so that it closes.

00:51:59.120 --> 00:51:59.990
OK.

00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:03.570
So there's a lot of challenges
of this shared accounting

00:52:03.570 --> 00:52:04.070
system.

00:52:04.070 --> 00:52:06.680
Scalability,
performance-- you can

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:10.730
move about 7 or 10 transactions
on Bitcoin per second.

00:52:10.730 --> 00:52:14.490
You can move 10 to 20
transactions a second

00:52:14.490 --> 00:52:17.070
on Ethereum.

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:20.480
That's kind of not the shot
that we need to this system.

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:25.850
Our shared, centralized
equity-clearing system here

00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:33.093
in the US, the Depository
Trust, DTCC, needs to move--

00:52:33.093 --> 00:52:35.260
the Securities and Exchange
Commission sort of said,

00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:38.380
you need to be able to move
about 100 million transactions

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.742
a day.

00:52:39.742 --> 00:52:40.450
Well, guess what?

00:52:40.450 --> 00:52:44.230
In the middle of one of the
most volatile time in February,

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:48.237
DTCC was moving 350
million transactions.

00:52:48.237 --> 00:52:50.820
And when I say transactions, it
could be for a hundred shares,

00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:53.500
it could be a thousand shares
or if the volumes in shares

00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.110
was higher.

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:56.920
But I'm talking about how
many transactions were

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.840
moving through that system.

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:01.240
Blockchain technology
by and large

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:04.630
has a bunch of issues
still to sort through,

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:08.320
is the point, from public policy
issues, commercial use cases,

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.470
and the like.

00:53:09.470 --> 00:53:11.650
And the question
is for the 2020,

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.660
as these scalability,
performance,

00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:16.810
and efficiency issues,
as privacy and security,

00:53:16.810 --> 00:53:20.020
as some of these
are worked through,

00:53:20.020 --> 00:53:23.680
is a shared accounting system,
a shared ledger system something

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.420
that's going to take off?

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:30.640
And I go back to economic
work from the 1930s by Coase.

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:33.700
And i just sort of capture
it in a little slide here

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:37.960
the trade-offs of centralization
and decentralization,

00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:39.370
and these as a cost curve.

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:42.020
But centralization
does lead to cost,

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:46.360
about a single point of
failure, about economic rents,

00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:51.170
and about capture.

00:53:51.170 --> 00:53:54.140
We all know that we
pay more for something

00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:55.460
that's highly centralized.

00:53:55.460 --> 00:54:01.620
If you want to build an app
on top of iOS or on top--

00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:05.630
Apple's iOS or an app on
top of Google's Android,

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:07.850
you're going to pay a
fee, because they're

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:10.850
the two dominant
pipes if you need

00:54:10.850 --> 00:54:15.080
to deal with certain
centralized financial systems,

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:16.670
there's more economic rents.

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:20.010
And in fact, the
financial sector in the US

00:54:20.010 --> 00:54:23.070
takes about 7 and
1/2% of our economy.

00:54:23.070 --> 00:54:27.040
That's double what
it took in the 1960s.

00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:30.990
Now, it's a bigger economy,
it's a bigger financial sector.

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:34.630
But does it necessarily need to
take 7 and 1/2% of our economy?

00:54:34.630 --> 00:54:36.330
So some would say,
those are some

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:39.570
of the costs of centralization.

00:54:39.570 --> 00:54:42.870
And then there's also
cost of decentralization--

00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:45.530
coordination, governance,
security, scalability.

00:54:45.530 --> 00:54:48.600
Now, Coase was
writing in the 1930s

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:51.810
why do you bring together
certain attributes inside

00:54:51.810 --> 00:54:52.500
of a firm.

00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:54.300
It was about the
theory of the firm

00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.660
and why some things
are inside a firm.

00:54:57.660 --> 00:55:00.690
And it was the cost
of information,

00:55:00.690 --> 00:55:04.320
the cost of coordination, that
you bring some things inside,

00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.060
some things are left out.

00:55:06.060 --> 00:55:10.000
The question is, will this
change this balance somehow?

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.200
Vitalik Buterin talked
about a trilemma

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:17.140
and said it's hard to
get all three of these,

00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:19.330
to get security,
decentralization,

00:55:19.330 --> 00:55:20.430
and scalability.

00:55:20.430 --> 00:55:24.910
So Buterin is the innovator,
at 19, of the Ethereum network.

00:55:24.910 --> 00:55:28.870
He's now 25, maybe.

00:55:28.870 --> 00:55:31.690
But Vitalik Buterin
said, look, you

00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:35.170
can get decentralization like
in Bitcoin and secure it.

00:55:35.170 --> 00:55:38.320
It's reasonably secure,
but it's not scalable.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:40.900
You maybe can get
towards scalability,

00:55:40.900 --> 00:55:42.310
but you're probably
going to tend

00:55:42.310 --> 00:55:44.890
towards more centralization.

00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:49.070
Now, one of MIT's award-winning
computer scientists,

00:55:49.070 --> 00:55:52.220
Silvio Micali, says,
no, he disagrees.

00:55:52.220 --> 00:55:54.580
He says you can
actually solve for this.

00:55:54.580 --> 00:55:57.490
Silvio won the Turing Award.

00:55:57.490 --> 00:56:00.273
He's sort of the father--

00:56:00.273 --> 00:56:01.690
considered the
father of something

00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:03.658
called zero-knowledge
proofs, and said, no, you

00:56:03.658 --> 00:56:04.450
can solve for this.

00:56:04.450 --> 00:56:07.150
And Silvio actually
took a sabbatical

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:11.920
leave to create a cryptocurrency
and a company around Algorand.

00:56:11.920 --> 00:56:14.230
And I'm not sort of
marketing for him,

00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:17.200
but I'm just commenting,
there's this debate.

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:21.650
Can you solve, basically,
what Satoshi Nakamoto wanted--

00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:27.830
decentralization in a scalable
way and have it be secure?

00:56:27.830 --> 00:56:29.770
So how does one
assess use cases?

00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:31.540
Because this class
is ultimately about

00:56:31.540 --> 00:56:32.973
sort of sorting through this.

00:56:32.973 --> 00:56:34.390
Well, first he
asked the question,

00:56:34.390 --> 00:56:38.650
is the project a project that
actually uses cryptocurrency,

00:56:38.650 --> 00:56:39.810
or it services it?

00:56:39.810 --> 00:56:42.890
And I give examples
of companies that

00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:46.730
are in custody, in software, in
exchange operation, finances,

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:49.060
the crypto exchange.

00:56:49.060 --> 00:56:51.610
Coinbase is both an
exchange and custody.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:54.730
Fidelity, one of the world's
largest asset managers,

00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:59.340
said, we'll take custody and
hold your cryptocurrencies.

00:56:59.340 --> 00:57:02.370
So you could be on one
side of the divide and say,

00:57:02.370 --> 00:57:05.910
we're going to be even like
a hardware company BitMain

00:57:05.910 --> 00:57:10.330
and create the
hardware in this space.

00:57:10.330 --> 00:57:15.970
Those are kind of used
classic strategy analysis

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:17.250
to think about those.

00:57:17.250 --> 00:57:20.500
The sort of rougher
side of this is,

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.020
how do you consider what
are the strategic questions

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:27.010
about actually using
blockchain technology?

00:57:27.010 --> 00:57:29.710
What are the value
creation propositions?

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:31.720
And I think it's
embedded in this--

00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:34.630
is it worthwhile to have
decentralized computing

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:37.260
versus centralized computing?

00:57:37.260 --> 00:57:39.850
Is there an area
that you think has

00:57:39.850 --> 00:57:44.620
such high economic rents that
a decentralized competitor can

00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:46.300
come in?

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.810
You could create the case that
if Uber and Lyft didn't exist

00:57:49.810 --> 00:57:52.270
today, that Uber and
Lyft, you could say,

00:57:52.270 --> 00:57:57.270
could be created on a
decentralized ledger system.

00:57:57.270 --> 00:58:00.180
But nobody truly had control
of the ledger system,

00:58:00.180 --> 00:58:06.750
and all the ride sharing could
be with drivers and users

00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:08.940
using that decentralized app.

00:58:08.940 --> 00:58:13.910
But then again, who would
have actually gone into city

00:58:13.910 --> 00:58:16.610
after city, airport
after airport,

00:58:16.610 --> 00:58:19.370
and should have done what
Uber and Lyft and others have

00:58:19.370 --> 00:58:22.790
done to get into the system?

00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:26.350
So I think the basic value
question is centralization

00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:29.290
versus decentralization,
and secondly,

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:33.400
are you filling a gap in
the fiat currency system?

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:36.680
Fiat currencies
work pretty well.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.610
Now, we're going to talk in
the next class about the pain

00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:40.450
points.

00:58:40.450 --> 00:58:44.130
And there are a lot of pain
points in the payment system

00:58:44.130 --> 00:58:48.130
that take considerable
challenges

00:58:48.130 --> 00:58:51.250
and costs to overcome.

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:53.560
Clearly, strategically what
are the competitors doing--

00:58:53.560 --> 00:58:56.590
traditional competitors,
those using blockchain.

00:58:56.590 --> 00:59:00.100
Why use append-only
logs, this invention

00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:01.330
of this ledger system?

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:03.580
Why have multiple-party
consensus?

00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:08.060
Multiple-party
consensus is a cost.

00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:11.540
So if you're going to
use it for trade finance,

00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:13.540
you're going to try to
solve something and trade

00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:18.670
finance for instance, what is
it solving, what are the costs?

00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:22.040
It can lower verification
and networking cost.

00:59:22.040 --> 00:59:24.730
That's the core
of its economics.

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:27.490
But it comes with some cost.

00:59:27.490 --> 00:59:30.490
There are also a series of
tactical considerations--

00:59:30.490 --> 00:59:32.910
literally, what data
is going to be put in?

00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:35.920
Who is the multiple
stakeholders?

00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:38.050
What are the trade-offs?

00:59:38.050 --> 00:59:40.570
And I think what we've
found by and large

00:59:40.570 --> 00:59:45.100
is there are not that many
projects that have taken off.

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:47.180
I have here a little
bit deeper dive.

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:50.020
If you get so close to a project
that you think, all right,

00:59:50.020 --> 00:59:51.580
now let's think about it--

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:54.730
I come back to this question
about multiple-party shared

00:59:54.730 --> 00:59:56.620
ledgers.

00:59:56.620 --> 01:00:00.250
In Bitcoin, the multiple-party
shared ledger has worked

01:00:00.250 --> 01:00:03.550
in part because there
was a desire to have

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:05.770
a censorship-resistant token--

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:09.940
a token that could be global,
truly move around the globe,

01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:14.170
at times away from what the
official sector might ban,

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:19.450
away from certain money
laundering anti-terrorism laws,

01:00:19.450 --> 01:00:20.990
that's part of it--

01:00:20.990 --> 01:00:23.770
but also that it was,
at least initially,

01:00:23.770 --> 01:00:26.110
hard to track and trace.

01:00:26.110 --> 01:00:30.680
It's actually gotten easier
to track and trace over time.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.380
But really the
question is, if you're

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.110
going to think about using
blockchain technology,

01:00:35.110 --> 01:00:38.770
what verification cost
are you really lowering,

01:00:38.770 --> 01:00:42.550
and why have this multiple-party
distributed ledger?

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:45.220
A little bit like a
shared stock company

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.530
still has a lot
of centralization.

01:00:47.530 --> 01:00:50.770
You have thousands of people
that control a shared stock

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:53.990
company, this invention
of several centuries ago,

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:57.160
but you still have
the management team

01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.480
that controls it.

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.800
How do you deal with that here?

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.660
So, what have we found?

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.790
We found that the incumbents,
big finance, by and large,

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:10.350
have stayed over to the
left-hand side of this screen.

01:01:10.350 --> 01:01:13.570
They've stayed towards
traditional databases.

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:16.500
They haven't gone to
the cryptocurrency sort

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.870
of side of this screen--

01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:21.250
permissionless open protocols.

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:23.780
They're exploring a little
bit the middle, what's

01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:28.120
called private blockchain,
"private blockchain" saying,

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.610
20 or 50 companies get together.

01:01:30.610 --> 01:01:37.570
Maybe-- like in Australia,
there was much fanfare in 2016

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:41.170
into, actually, 2017,
there was much fanfare

01:01:41.170 --> 01:01:43.180
that the Australian
Stock Exchange

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:48.070
would use a permissioned
blockchain technology to update

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:50.440
their central clearing.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:52.690
Now, many people
would tell you by 2020

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:55.570
that what the
Australians have done

01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:58.400
was inspired by
blockchain technology,

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.850
but it no longer looks
like blockchain technology.

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:04.940
It's a decentralized,
distributed database.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:07.540
But what the Australian
regulator said is,

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.610
we need somebody
to control this.

01:02:09.610 --> 01:02:13.420
We need a central controller--
the complete opposite

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:15.850
of what Satoshi Nakamoto
was talking about.

01:02:15.850 --> 01:02:18.490
Nakamoto was saying
no central authority.

01:02:18.490 --> 01:02:20.170
But the Australians
said, well this

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:23.590
is the central clearing,
sort of the plumbing,

01:02:23.590 --> 01:02:26.820
the central plumbing, of
the Australian stock market.

01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.840
No, we need somebody who
has kind of the overall--

01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:36.680
plays the overall referee
role, so to speak.

01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:41.880
So incumbents by and large are
using traditional databases.

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.700
They're exploring some of
these permissioned databases.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:48.322
They're not really
off to the side.

01:02:48.322 --> 01:02:51.483
Romain, any questions?

01:02:51.483 --> 01:02:52.400
AUDIENCE: None so far.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.070
We have 12 minutes left.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:55.070
GARY GENSLER: All right.

01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:59.180
So let me just say something
about central bank initiatives.

01:02:59.180 --> 01:03:02.600
Central banks-- and we'll chat
about this a little bit more

01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:05.780
when we do payments-- central
banks have taken note of this.

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:10.470
And they've thought both, can
I use the blockchain technology

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:11.910
for our payment systems--

01:03:11.910 --> 01:03:14.130
because central banks
in most countries

01:03:14.130 --> 01:03:17.500
control those payment systems--

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:20.740
or can we actually create
a digital currency?

01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:23.500
At first, I mean,
Bitcoin was not

01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.080
really on the radar
of central bankers.

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:31.120
By 2018, it became on the
radar because the market had

01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.910
taken off and it was,
for a brief moment,

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:36.170
worth almost $1 trillion.

01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:40.750
It's back down to $200 billion,
now but they took note.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.670
And in some countries
like Sweden,

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:46.360
they really said, maybe we
should be doing something here.

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:52.630
We should be creating a crypto
equivalent, a digital currency.

01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:55.720
And one of the readings
was a Bank of International

01:03:55.720 --> 01:03:58.750
Settlement reading, which
showed three different ways

01:03:58.750 --> 01:04:01.120
that a central bank could
do a digital currency.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:02.620
And this is just
for your reference

01:04:02.620 --> 01:04:06.520
to remind you that it
was in the reading.

01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:10.660
But going back to these
projects a little bit,

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:15.880
some of the projects
are just papers.

01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:18.510
Ecuador tried to do
a project, actually--

01:04:18.510 --> 01:04:23.080
a dollar-denominated
cryptocurrency.

01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:27.310
And it failed because nobody
in Ecuador wanted to use it.

01:04:27.310 --> 01:04:29.950
Ecuador was already dollarized.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:33.700
But the one to watch
most closely, China,

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.520
which might be a hybrid--
and I'll go back to the chart

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.600
in a second--

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.900
China has announced they're
doing a digital currency

01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.610
electronic payment.

01:04:42.610 --> 01:04:46.120
It will be fully backed
by the central bank.

01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:50.600
It will be fully a
renminbi or digital block.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:56.210
And in a sense, it may be as
much a reaction to Bitcoin

01:04:56.210 --> 01:04:59.540
as it's a reaction
to Alipay and WeChat

01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:04.630
Pay being dominant in the
retail payment system in China.

01:05:04.630 --> 01:05:06.930
And it's also a
reaction to Facebook

01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:10.970
that was starting something
called the Libra project.

01:05:10.970 --> 01:05:14.420
So this, again,
is a central tenet

01:05:14.420 --> 01:05:18.920
where I am, where I think of
this as that the central banks

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:25.150
are reacting in part because
big tech has been reacting

01:05:25.150 --> 01:05:27.130
and startups are there.

01:05:27.130 --> 01:05:30.190
And they're saying, maybe
we can do something better.

01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:33.500
The opportunities that they
see, the opportunities is

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:34.900
that they say,
well, maybe we can

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:36.550
stay in the means of payment.

01:05:36.550 --> 01:05:39.100
We can promote
greater competition,

01:05:39.100 --> 01:05:41.540
and we can address
some pain points.

01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:44.890
But on the other side,
they're really worried.

01:05:44.890 --> 01:05:47.650
They're deeply
worried that if they

01:05:47.650 --> 01:05:54.570
offer the public a digital
representation of central bank

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:58.320
money, that they
might disintermediate

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.800
the commercial banks.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.840
The central strategic
question for central banks

01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:08.250
is, can we offer the public
a digital representation

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:11.380
of that which is paper?

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:15.462
So I've covered central bank
digital currencies too quickly.

01:06:15.462 --> 01:06:17.170
I'm going to come back
to it when we talk

01:06:17.170 --> 01:06:20.680
about payment systems as well.

01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.920
But Romain, we only
have a few minutes

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:26.120
so I'm going to take questions.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.020
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we have
a question from Victor.

01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.570
AUDIENCE: Hi, professor.

01:06:30.570 --> 01:06:33.860
I want to come back to this
point about handling databases

01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.083
through a private
blockchain network,

01:06:36.083 --> 01:06:38.250
because I didn't fully
understand how it would work.

01:06:38.250 --> 01:06:41.460
Could you give me some
more guidance on it?

01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:45.330
GARY GENSLER: So Satoshi
Nakamoto's concept

01:06:45.330 --> 01:06:49.860
is that you could have
hundreds or thousands of folks'

01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:52.920
computers sharing a
database, and it's

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:57.840
an open database, and
that that database can

01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:03.230
secure the ledger through this
concept of a log structure--

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:05.220
block of data,
block of data, block

01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:08.610
of data with cryptography.

01:07:08.610 --> 01:07:11.790
The commercial banks
and the financial firms

01:07:11.790 --> 01:07:16.620
said, we're not comfortable of
having hundreds or thousands

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:18.790
of people share a database.

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:19.650
In fact, we can't.

01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:25.320
Under various guidelines of
privacy, of data protection,

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.530
we can't have hundreds of
people share that database.

01:07:28.530 --> 01:07:32.010
But they're looking
at, maybe we can

01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:36.120
have a shared form
of cooperation,

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:38.790
or what somebody might
call coopetition.

01:07:38.790 --> 01:07:44.100
We'll cooperate around the
trade finance platform,

01:07:44.100 --> 01:07:45.870
and then we'll
compete on top of it

01:07:45.870 --> 01:07:52.090
for the provision of lines of
credit, and trade financing,

01:07:52.090 --> 01:07:54.160
and so on.

01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.780
So they've come
together and said,

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.050
maybe we can have a
shared closed system

01:07:59.050 --> 01:08:03.190
amongst 20 banks, 16 banks,
30 banks, and the like.

01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:05.440
And so there's five
or six big consortiums

01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:10.650
trying to put together a trade
finance private shared ledger.

01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:14.080
Now, once you have
that, once you say,

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:18.300
it's only these 18
firms will share it--

01:08:18.300 --> 01:08:21.779
this form of cooperating
on a shared database

01:08:21.779 --> 01:08:25.830
but competing on top of it,
that form of coopetition--

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:28.029
you don't necessarily
need a token.

01:08:28.029 --> 01:08:31.229
So there's no cryptocurrency,
it's just a shared blockchain

01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:33.149
technology database.

01:08:33.149 --> 01:08:38.750
Some call it a Digital
Ledger Technology, DTP,

01:08:38.750 --> 01:08:41.865
to contrast it with
cryptocurrencies.

01:08:41.865 --> 01:08:45.540
I'm a little bit looser in
the vocabulary, admittedly.

01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:49.680
But that's how-- that's the
conceptual framework for it,

01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:50.970
if that helps.

01:08:50.970 --> 01:08:52.087
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

01:08:52.087 --> 01:08:53.670
GARY GENSLER: Let
me just say a couple

01:08:53.670 --> 01:08:56.520
of ground truths in close.

01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:58.229
I really do think--

01:08:58.229 --> 01:09:00.390
and I don't know which
side to end up on,

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:04.090
Devin or Camilo's side,
in terms of, is it money?

01:09:04.090 --> 01:09:06.899
But I think Nakamoto
solved the payment riddle--

01:09:06.899 --> 01:09:08.220
avoiding double spending.

01:09:08.220 --> 01:09:10.800
It's lasted 12 years.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:15.359
Whether you like it, whether
you love it, hate it, two is--

01:09:15.359 --> 01:09:17.430
I'm sorry, Hassan--
I'm kind of--

01:09:17.430 --> 01:09:20.430
money is but a social
and economic construct.

01:09:20.430 --> 01:09:23.939
I'm deeply with
Plato on that one.

01:09:23.939 --> 01:09:26.939
But I respect those
that believe otherwise.

01:09:26.939 --> 01:09:28.500
I mean, there's a
good debate that's

01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.720
gone on a couple
of thousand years.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.420
We already live in an
age of digital money.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:38.335
And in fact, the corona
crisis will accelerate that.

01:09:38.335 --> 01:09:40.990
We will still have
physical paper money,

01:09:40.990 --> 01:09:44.240
but we'll use it less
and less in transaction.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:49.359
And physical paper money is more
and more just a store of value.

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:51.340
We're not using
physical paper money

01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:55.070
much as a medium of
exchange right now.

01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:57.490
Append-only logs and
multi-party consensus

01:09:57.490 --> 01:09:59.860
actually does provide
an alternative,

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:02.260
but it doesn't mean it's
everybody's alternative.

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:05.260
It can address
verification costs,

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:08.060
but it doesn't make sense to
adopt it unless there's really

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.990
some viability and a value
proposition of that shared

01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:14.250
ledger system.

01:10:14.250 --> 01:10:17.390
We didn't talk much about it,
but I will say one ground truth

01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:21.390
is that the crypto markets--
that $200 billion market--

01:10:21.390 --> 01:10:23.730
it's ripe with scams and frauds.

01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:25.960
It just is.

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:29.400
And so what's happened by
2020 is cryptocurrencies

01:10:29.400 --> 01:10:32.880
have evolved to be a speculative
asset class, generally

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.700
not that correlated
with equities and bonds.

01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.230
And I'll give you one statistic.

01:10:37.230 --> 01:10:39.190
The worldwide stock
of gold, that gold

01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:43.360
that could be in four
Olympic-sized pools,

01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:45.850
collectively is worth
$9 or $10 trillion,

01:10:45.850 --> 01:10:48.560
roughly, collectively.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:51.100
So some people would say a
speculative store of value

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:55.240
that's only worth 2%
of that, $200 billion,

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.710
might be worthwhile in a
big portfolio of a family

01:10:59.710 --> 01:11:02.900
office or a hedge fund.

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:07.060
The ICO boom and bust
raised about $30 billion.

01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:09.020
Not much is being
raised there now,

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:12.060
but it's worthwhile
to take note of.

01:11:12.060 --> 01:11:14.250
Most of this is
lightly regulated,

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:17.790
and so retail investors are
not getting much protection.

01:11:17.790 --> 01:11:20.730
I think that's unfortunate.

01:11:20.730 --> 01:11:22.550
But I still come back
to the last point.

01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:24.660
I think it's been a
catalyst for change.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:27.310
I think it might be one of
these technologies we look back

01:11:27.310 --> 01:11:31.760
in decades and say, it was a
remarkable catalyst for change

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.490
for central bankers,
and to think through

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:37.370
whether it's trade finance
or other areas in finance,

01:11:37.370 --> 01:11:40.760
was their way to
form some cooperation

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:44.780
and compete on top of
it-- so coopetition?

01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:48.140
But just like we didn't
know that the internet

01:11:48.140 --> 01:11:54.890
and geolocation devices would
lead to disruption in rides--

01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:59.210
you know, Uber and Lyft, we
couldn't predict in the 1990s

01:11:59.210 --> 01:12:01.190
that the taxicab
business in New York

01:12:01.190 --> 01:12:04.190
was going to be
completely disrupted.

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:08.090
We don't know what blockchain
technology and cryptocurrencies

01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:12.920
will disrupt later in the
2020s or in the 2030s.

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.220
So that's kind of my wrap on it.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.830
You can sort of
get a sense of why

01:12:18.830 --> 01:12:23.120
I'm not going to say I'm
a maximalist in this area.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.330
But I'm also not all
the way a minimalist.

01:12:25.330 --> 01:12:28.310
The minimalist would say, no,
none of these ground truths

01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:29.270
matter.

01:12:29.270 --> 01:12:32.540
I think it's a really important
technology, if nothing else,

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:35.390
because it's been a
remarkable catalyst for change

01:12:35.390 --> 01:12:39.170
on how central banks and others
think about payment systems,

01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:42.130
which we'll take up in our next

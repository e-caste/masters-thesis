00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
A very simply little
demonstration.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
And I would like you to take a
look at the two materials that

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
are in the two vials I have
here.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
One of these that I am taping
is a beige-colored solid,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and it is iron dichloride,
ferrous chloride.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And then over here,
I have an organic molecule that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
is colorless,
just white.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
And what I am going to do is
first make a solution of the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
ferrous chloride in water.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I am just using a very small
amount.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
And what you will see is that
the FeCl two dissolves

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
up pretty nicely in water,
and it gives a solution that

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
has very little color to it.
You might be able to see that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
it looks maybe pale yellow.
Can you see that?

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Okay.
To that solution of ferrous

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
chloride in water,
I am now going to add this

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
organic molecule.
I will draw the molecule for

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you before we finish today.
And I am just going to add a

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
small amount of this colorless
organic molecule --

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
-- to get a very nice intense
red color in the aqueous

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
solution.
And the person I am going to be

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
talking about today is the one
who really figured out what is

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
going on in a reaction like
that.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And this was a great mystery
for a long period of time,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
until Alfred Werner came along.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
I would encourage you while you
are at home, perhaps,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
or visiting friends over this
coming weekend,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
to go onto the Internet and go
to the Nobel Prize website,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
where you can read a very nice
short bibliography of Alfred

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Werner, because he won the Nobel
Prize in 1913.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
And he won this prize based on
a theory that he developed

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
stemming from observations he
made regarding reactions of

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
metal salts with various
substances.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
And I am going to point out
initially, here,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
that he studied the reaction of
cobalt three chloride.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I just used iron dichloride.
This is cobalt trichloride

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
reacting with six equivalents of
ammonia.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
And he observed that if to
aqueous solution of cobalt

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
trichloride was added six
equivalence of NH three,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:45.000
ammonia, followed by silver
nitrate, that that resulted in

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
no AgCl precipitate.
And that is rather astounding.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Sorry.
We will get to "no,"

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000
but this one is "all."
How does he do this experiment?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
He just puts these things in
solution, adds silver nitrate,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
and either there is or is not a
precipitative silver chloride,

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
which is very insoluble.
And that precipitate can be

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
collected by filtration,
dried, and then weighed.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And then, in comparison with
the mass of the added

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
substances, you would know how
much of the chloride that was

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
put into the reaction actually
came out as insoluble silver

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
chloride precipitate.
And he did a series of

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
experiments.
And so, if he uses cobalt

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.000
trichloride and less ammonia,
namely five equivalents of

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000
ammonia, then he finds that that
leads instead to two-thirds of

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000
the possible AgCl precipitate.
And continuing down.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000
If he uses now only four
equivalence of ammonia,

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
then the addition of silver
nitrate provides one-third of

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
the possible of the total
precipitated chloride.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000
And then, finally,
if he drops down the number of

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000
equivalents of ammonia to three,
then we get none,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000
zero of the AgCl precipitating.
And a further observation,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
to add to these four
observations,

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
was that in no case,
here, did the solution give a

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
reaction with hydrogen chloride.
What is the significance of

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000
that?
Hydrogen chloride,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000
of course, is a strong Bronsted
acid.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
And, if you have a base in
solution, it should react with

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
that Bronsted acid.
And what are we adding here?

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
We are adding ammonia.
And ammonia is a base,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
isn't it?
But when you do the experiment

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
like this and then test for any
reactivity with hydrogen

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
chloride, there is no reactivity
with hydrogen chloride.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
So what is going on?
And, secondly,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
normally, this reaction with
silver nitrate is used to

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000
quantitatively precipitate
chloride from solution.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
So it is a quantitative
analytical test for chloride in

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
solution.
And the less ammonia we add,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
the less silver chloride we are
getting as a precipitate.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
How are these facts related?
Well, Alfred Werner put it all

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.000
together, and he correctly
formulated these complexes.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Let me write this as follows.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
In that first instance,
when we have added six

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
ammonias, Werner decided that
the reason that ammonia is not

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.000
in solution in a form that is
reactive with hydrogen chloride

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000
is because the ammonia is
coordinated to the metal.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
And so he wrote the formula
this way.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Cobalt NH three six times.
And this species

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000
is a trication.
And to balance those three

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
positive charges,
we find that there must be

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
three chloride ions outside of
what we are going to call the

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000
inner coordination sphere of the
cobalt complex.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Now, there were lots of
different preparations that had

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
been reported in the literature
back at this time of materials

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
that seem to be composed of
metal ions and mixtures of

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
chloride or ammonia or other
types of molecules.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
And this kind of a formulation
of them was completely unique.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
And I really think that in the
history of chemistry,

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000
you can compare Alfred Werner's
leap, his development of the

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
coordination theory as very much
analogous to Kekule's

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000
description of planar benzene
with all equivalent C-C bond

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000
distances.
This is really a tremendous

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
leap in our thinking about
molecules.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.000
And then, in the case where he
is adding five equivalents of

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
ammonia, those five equivalents
all go onto the cobalt,

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
and so does one chloride ion.
So he writes it that way.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And that chloride ion is
balancing one of the three

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
positive charges on the cobalt
plus three ion.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
So this overall,
now, has a two plus charge,

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
and there are two chlorides
external to balance the charge

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
on that.
And then in case three,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000
we have added four NH three
per cobalt to solution.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Four of them go on the metal
and two chlorides remain and

00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:00.000
interact with the metal in a way
that we will discuss shortly.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
And that system now has two of
the plus three charges on cobalt

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000
three balanced by chlorides that
are in the inner coordination

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
sphere.
And only a single chloride,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
now, is needed externally to
balance that charge to give

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
overall a neutral system.
And then, finally,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000
when only three equivalents of
ammonia are added to solution,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.000
those three equivalents per
cobalt bind to the metal.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And all three of the original
chlorides can be included in the

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
primary coordination sphere,
balancing the three positive

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
charges on the cobalt three ion
and giving overall a neutral

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
coordination complex.
This is coordination theory.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
And the dominance of organic
chemistry at that point in time

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
was very great.
Most of the people who were

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000
thinking about these unusual
substances were thinking that

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000
they might have structures
analogous to those that organic

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
molecules have.
And typical hydrocarbon

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
molecules like n-pentane or
n-hexane have sequential joined

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
CH two groups,
repeating CH two groups

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000
in a line.
And so the type of formula that

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000
you were seeing people write for
these molecules at that point in

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
time was, for example,
a cobalt.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
And then NH three,
NH three, NH three,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000
NH three, somehow all stuck

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
together in a way that does not
seem very intuitive to us today

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
because we know so much more
now, partly due to the

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
accomplishments of Alfred
Werner.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
This systematic set of
observations,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
the use of silver chloride's
insolubility as a means of

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
precipitating it out so that you
could distinguish between

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
external chloride from chloride
that is actually in the

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000
coordination complex.
And let me define coordination

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
complex.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:34.000
The coordination complex is a
metal ion.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Plus its ligands.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:51.000
So there is another word that
you need to learn in this

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
context.
Here, I would like to define

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
the term ligand as an atom,
or a molecule,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
or an ion, that can bind
directly to a metal like cobalt

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
in its primary coordination
sphere.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And that means that they are
directly connected to the metal.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
And the amazing thing here and
what was so different from

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
organic chemistry at this time
was the idea that a single metal

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
ion can have a fairly large
number of ligands.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
In this particular case,
Werner analyzed his experiments

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.000
with the assumption of
coordination number being equal

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
to six.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
So here, it is six.
But coordination number is a

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
variable that depends on the
metal itself and depends on the

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.000
specific choice of the ligands.
Some molecules are known in

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
which there are very low
coordination numbers.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.000
A coordination number can be as
small as two or one in some very

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000
special instances for insoluble
molecules.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And for very large metal ions,
sometimes the coordination

00:14:18.388 --> 00:00:12.000
number can be as great as about

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000
So 12 atoms or ions or
molecules directly connected to

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
a central metal atom.
And ligands don't have to be as

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:37.000
simple as chloride or ammonia.
Ligands can have some pretty

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
interesting architectures.
And you can even dream up new

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
ligands with which to decorate a
metal ion and with which to

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000
imbue it with special properties
for purposes like catalysis.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
We will be talking soon about
metaloenzymes.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
These are proteins as ligands
to metal complexes.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
And very many important enzymes
are metaloenzymes that have

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000
these elements from the 3D part
of the periodic table bonded.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Here is what we call the
d-block, --

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:26.000
-- or transition elements.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
And, in the case of the 3D
series, you will know that we

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
have metals like titanium,
vanadium, chromium,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
manganese, iron,
cobalt, nickel.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:50.000
These are called transition
elements because oftentimes in

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000
ions stemming from these
elements, as you go from left to

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000
right across the periodic table,
you are adding more electrons

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:06.000
to an incompletely filled
d-shell.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And at the end today,
we are going to talk a little

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
bit about the bonding properties
of transition elements.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
And that will hearken back to
what I said with my discussion

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
of carbon monoxide and why it is
a poison.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
And it is the interaction,
actually, with certain

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
d-orbitals on the iron in
hemoglobin that makes CO a toxic

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
substance.
And so how does this work?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
How do ligands coordinate two
metals?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
Well, one simple way is if you
have a ligand like ammonia that

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
is a base, it can also be a
nucleophile, and the metal can

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000
be the corresponding
electrophile.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
I can draw that to represent a
lone pair of electrons on the

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000
nitrogen.
Now that we have studied

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000
molecular orbital theory,
you will know that I can also

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
call this the highest occupied
molecular orbital of the NH

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
three molecule.
And it is the one responsible

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.000
for the basicity of the ammonia
molecule and the one responsible

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000
for its ability to serve as a
ligand in coordination

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
complexes, like these.
And you might also suspect that

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
we might have some contributions
to this highest occupied

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000
molecular orbital from hydrogen
1s linear combinations.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
I will just draw that in to
make it a little bit more

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000
accurate.
And so, you can think of this

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
as a big fat lone pair that will
coordinate to Lewis acids.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
And the metal ion is a Lewis
acid.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000
But it is a very interesting
Lewis acid because,

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.000
unlike the BH three
molecule that has a single empty

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000
orbital, this metal seems to be
able to act as a Lewis acid six

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000
times and coordinate six bases
to it in forming this

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
coordination complex.
And if we go ahead and

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:32.000
crystallize molecules of this
sort and use X-ray diffraction

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000
studies to determine the bond
angles and bond distances in

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:43.000
systems like this,
what we would find is that

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
these nitrogens are located at
the vertices of a nice,

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000
regular octahedron.
So, in the case of our first

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:59.000
one, we can draw it out this
way.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
This first one is what would
result if, to that aqueous

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
solution of cobalt trichloride,
we were to add six equivalents

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
of ammonia.
This is Werner's first system.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
It is a molecule oriented like
this.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.000
That lone pair that comes from
the highest occupied molecular

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
orbital of ammonia is directed
right at the metal from each of

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.000
the six ammonia ligands.
And this system does have a

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
three plus charge that is
balanced by three chloride ions

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
in solution.
This locating of six nitrogens

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000
in an array in space that
approximates a regular

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000
octahedron is what makes the
octahedron such a central aspect

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
of the theory of transition
element chemistry.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000
And, if you are going to design
molecules that do include these

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
transition metal ions,
--

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
-- whether you are going to do
it for their color,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
like the red color there of the
iron complex that we made a few

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
moments ago, or whether you are
going to do it to take advantage

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
of the properties associated
with unpaired electrons like

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
magnetism, for example,
you would begin any such

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000
approach with the octahedron as
your starting point.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Let's go ahead and consider
some of the other examples

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
provided to us by Alfred Werner.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000
If instead of six,
we are adding only five NH

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
three molecules for
every cobalt,

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
then what happens --

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000
-- is indeed we do get an
octahedron, but one of the

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:11.000
chlorides is not ionized.
It is bound directly to the

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000
metal, and it is serving as a
ligand.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
And this species,
therefore, has a two plus

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
charge.
The cobalt ion is still

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
considered here to be in the
plus three oxidation state.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
And this system is balanced by
two chloride ions that are

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
floating around externally in
solution and that are not in the

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:39.000
primary coordination sphere.
These atoms here that are part

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000
of ammonia molecules that are
bonded directly to the metal are

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
in the inner coordination
sphere.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000
That is, the inner or primary
coordination sphere.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
What do you think happens if
you take a metal salt and

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
dissolve it in water?
I did that a moment ago with

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
ferrous chloride.
I dissolved it in water.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Water is a very polar solvent.
It promotes the formation of

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
ions in solution because of its
great polarity.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
It is good at solvating ions,
water is, as a medium.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
If I take FeCl two
and add it to water,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
as I did a moment ago,
and it ionizes,

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
what is happening to the iron?

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
The iron is going to take up
water molecules into its inner

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
coordination sphere.
When you dissolve FeCl two

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
in solution,
which might often be written

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
quite simply as FeCl
two aqueous,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
what you really have in
solution is the system in which

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
six water molecules are bonded
to that iron.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
And, because I used FeCl two,
this system had a two

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
plus charged balanced by two of
the chloride ions that

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.000
dissociate from the iron and
ionize and go out into solution

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
to be solvated separately from
the cation by water.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
That initial weakly-colored
solution contained iron in this

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000
form, hexaaquairon two.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:54.000
And I will tell you a little
bit about what made the color

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
change in a moment.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:10.000
But first I would like to
discuss an issue that arises in

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
the Werner system.
And this is the problem of

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
isomerism.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Werner found that you could
make different cobalt complexes

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
that would have the same
chemical formula,

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000
but, for example,
one would be red and one would

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
be green, or one would be
yellow, for example,

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000
even though they have the same
chemical formula.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
And that was because,
as he correctly reasoned,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000
they were forming isomers.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.000
And this comes into play,
for example,

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
when you add only four
equivalents of ammonia to

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
solution.
And here is why.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:06.000
If I put the first chloride up
on top, as I have done here,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
there are two choices of where
to put the second one that are

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
not the same.
I can either put a chloride

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
here, such that we have a bond
angle of 90 degrees between the

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
two chlorides.
And I will draw in our

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:30.000
remaining ammonia molecules that
are coordinating to the cobalt.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000
This is an isomer that we would
call "cis." Cis denotes a

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:41.000
proximal arrangement of the two
chlorides with a 90 degree bond

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
angle between them.
And then the alternative here

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:51.000
would be to put the other
chloride 180 degrees away from

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
the first one.
And that gives us what we call

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
the trans iosomer.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
And note that both of these
would have a single plus charge.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Trans means across.
So the two chloride ligands are

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
located in a mutually trans
disposition here.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Isomerism is very important.
I will discuss a couple other

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:29.000
types of isomerism that you can
get and that Werner contributed

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:34.000
to our understanding of very
greatly.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
And let me do that by
completing consideration of

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.000
this.
You might ask yourself in the

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000
case where we added only three
ammonias to the solution is

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
there a possibility for the
formation of isomers?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
And the answer again would be
yes, we can have two

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:04.000
possibilities.
And this is for a neutral

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000
system that contains three
ammonias and three chloride

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
ligands.
And let's say I put the first

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
one here, the second one here,
the third one here.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
That is one of our possible
isomers of this neutral

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:24.000
coordination complex.
And then the other possibility,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
the only other possibility is
with one there,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:33.000
one there, --
-- and then the third one here.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And so you can try to draw
different structures.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
And you will see that these are
the only two possible structures

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
that you can draw for a
combination of three ammonia

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:47.000
ligands and three chloride
ligands surround a central

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000
cobalt three plus ion
in an octahedral

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
array.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And these have names,
too.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
This one is the so-called fac
isomer.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:10.000
And that fac is an abbreviation
of the word facial,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000
because if you remember that
the octahedron is composed of a

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
set of eight equilateral
triangles, then the polyhedron

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:30.000
that we call the octahedron has
both vertices and faces.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000
And these chlorides,
in this particular case,

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000
can be seen to define one of
the eight faces of the

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
octahedron.
And so that is the facial

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
isomer.
And then, the other type of

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
isomer for this type of
structure is called mer.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
And that is an abbreviation of
the word meridional,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
which would be like the
meridians of longitude that you

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000
see on the globe.
They start at the top and run

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000
down through the equator and all
the way down to the South Pole.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
That is your meridional isomer.
These isomers,

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
here, are called geometric
isomers.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
There are different types of
isomerism.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Because the complexes that
differ only with regard to the

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:40.000
spatial arrangement of the
ligands, but not with respect to

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:47.000
the formula of the system,
these would be types of isomers

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
known as geometric.
We have the possibility of CIS,

00:29:53.000 --> 00:30:00.000
TRANS, FAC, MER geometric
isomers for molecules that have

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
the same formula.
And then, there is a further

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000
type of isomerism.
And here, again,

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.000
the contributions of Alfred
Werner were exceedingly
important, because it was
thought that this next type of

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
isomerism was restricted to
organic molecules.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
And this is stereoisomerism.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Stereoisomerism is a little
more subtle than geometric

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000
isomerism.
And it is a little more subtle

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000
because two molecules that are
stereoisomers of each other are

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
related in the same way that
your left hand and your right

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
hand are related.
They are non-superimposable

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
mirror images.
If you can find a way to

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
separate molecules that are
chiral, then you can have a

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
sample that can do interesting
things, like rotate the plane of

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:07.000
polarized light.
This happens when you have

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000
chiral molecules.
And if a molecule is chiral,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
that is to say it is
non-superimposable on its mirror

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000
image.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
And in order to see whether a
molecule is or is not

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000
superimposable on its mirror
image, you really need to get

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000
good at visualizing things in
three-dimensions and at rotating

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
molecules around in your mind.
You can also do it on the

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000
computer.
And doing it on the computer

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:51.000
will help you prepare for doing
it on the exam,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
where you have to do it in your
mind.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000
But if you like architecture,
and you like visualizing things

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
in three-dimensions,
you should know that that is a

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
lot of what we do in chemistry.
You should think about these

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
molecules, these 3D structures,
in ways that allow you to test

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
for a property like
stereoisomerism.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000
And I mentioned that it was
thought that stereoisomerism was

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000
a property associated with
organic molecules.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000
And organic molecules were
compounds of carbon that were

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
thought to be associated very
fundamentally with life and

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
living things.
And so the fact that Werner in

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
one of his most amazing
accomplishments was ultimately

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
able to synthesize a
coordination complex that

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000
contained no carbon at all but
exhibited stereoisomerism just

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000
shattered that theory and really
helped to bring science onto a

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
much more firm footing.
And that parallelism between

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
organic and inorganic chemistry,
I think, has stemmed from this

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
aspect of its history.
And so let's look at an example

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
of a molecule that is chiral --

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
-- that could be made from
cobalt.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And if you imagine carrying out
a reaction like we were talking

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
about up above but not even
giving it enough ammonia to

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:23.000
displace all the water molecules
then you could have an

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
intermediate like this.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
And in this type of species
what I've got are two water

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
molecules, two ammonia
molecules, two chlorides.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
And so if this is cobalt three,
we would have a single positive

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:56.000
charge on that ion.
And what I can represent here

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
by a dashed line would be a
mirror plane.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:08.000
That is our mirror.
And we are going to reflect

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.000
this molecule through that
mirror plane to see what its

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
mirror image would look like.
And then, if you can rotate it

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.000
around in your mind,
we can determine whether it is

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:22.000
or is not superimposable on that
mirror image.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
I am generating the mirror
image by reflecting this water

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
to this position.
This ammonia back here reflects

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000
over to here.
The top ammonia reflects still

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
into the top position.
This water behind the board

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000
reflects behind the board.
And over here,

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:47.000
this chloride coming out in
front of the board reflects over

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
to here.
And we have one more chloride,

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
down on the bottom.
That molecule is now our mirror

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000
image.
And let's go ahead and rotate

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000
it, like this.
Because it is a little hard,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
I am going to highlight the
position of the two ammonia

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000
ligands.
And to see if this mirror image

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
is superimposable on the
structure we started with,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
I am going to rotate this
around so that we can put the

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
two ammonia ligands coincident
with the two shown here

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
underlined in green on the left.
We are going to do a rotation.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
And I need to rotate this.
I am going to rotate here,

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000
around the cobalt-chlorine bond
access.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
And I am actually going to go
in the negative direction to

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000
generate the following
structure.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:48.000
This puts this ammonia up top,
and it will put this one down

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
below.
We have NH three and NH three

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
here.
Let me underline them.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
So those are in positions,
coincident.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
And this rotation also will
carry that chloride from the

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
bottom up here,
into what I may call an

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
equatorial position.
And it puts a water molecule

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
down.
And that rotation about this

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:21.000
cobalt chlorine bond left the
cobalt and chlorine on that bond

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
axis unrotated.
And then in the back,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:29.000
we have this OH two molecule.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
And what you can see is,
if you now bring this over,

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
what we have,
in fact, is a situation where

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:39.000
we are not currently
superimposable with that choice.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
I generated the mirror image.
I have rotated it by 90 degrees

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
around the cobalt-chlorine bond
axis to bring these two ammonias

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
coincident with these two.
So you can see that,

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
whereas we have a water
molecule on the bottom here,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000
we have a chloride over here.
So that is not superimposable.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:06.000
But we can do one more rotation
to check the other possibility,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000
and that rotation will be a
rotation by 180 degrees around

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
an axis, here,
that bisects the

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
nitrogen-cobalt-nitrogen bond
angle of 90 degrees.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:25.000
We will rotate 180 degrees
around that axis,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
and that will bring our
ammonias, again,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:35.000
into a position so as to be
coincident.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
And rotating around that axis
brings a water around front here

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
and puts a chloride in back,
rotating around there,

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
and it swaps this chloride with
that water molecule.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.000
So we now have chloride down
and OH two over here.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
And so if we take this,
we identify our ammonia

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
positions by green underlining,
they're coincident,

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
here.
And now where we have a

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
chloride coming out,
we have a water coming out,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000
so our mirror image is not
superimposable on the structure

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000
that we generated it from
through the process of

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
reflection through that mirror
plane.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000
And so, what we can say is that
this molecule and this one

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:33.000
constitute a pair of
stereoisomers.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
And because this condition was
satisfied that the mirror image

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000
was not superimposable on the
structure we generated it from,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
the molecule is chiral.
And you will see that I have

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:47.000
chosen a molecule that contains
no carbon, and yet it is chiral

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
and it has stereoisomers.
And that was thought impossible

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
prior to the time of Werner.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Let me show you another example
of a molecule that is chiral.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000
And I am going to use this
example, also,

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.000
to illustrate another important
feature that ligands can have.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:23.000
And that is that they can have
more than one atom that can bond

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.000
to the metal at the same time.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
I am drawing a cobalt ion three
plus complex that

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
has six nitrogens directly
bonded to the cobalt.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.000
But now, look what I am going
to do.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000
I am going to put some organic
material in here and link these

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
nitrogens by a CH two CH two
unit,

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
a CH2-CH2 chain here.
So it is CH2-CH2.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
These carbons that I am
representing as vertices here

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:03.000
each have two additional
hydrogens that I am not showing.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
And that is typical organic
shorthand.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000
And I am going to suggest that
this molecule would be generated

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
by adding three of these ligands
to the metal center.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000
And for each nitrogen,
if you consider it as being

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
derived from ammonia,
one of the hydrogens of the

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
ammonia is replaced with a
nitrogen-carbon bond.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.000
And we have used this organic
moiety here to tether two

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
nitrogens together.
This is a very popular and

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
ancient ligand in coordination
chemistry.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:54.000
And, by drawing in simplistic
form the two lone pairs on the

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
two nitrogens,
you can see that this set of

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:07.000
four atoms is able to organize
itself so as to simultaneously

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:14.000
point two lone pairs at the same
metal center.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
That is permitted by this
bridge.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
This particular ligand is
called ethylenediamine.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.000
And it is called en for short,
ethylenediamine.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000
And it is an example of a
bidentate ligand.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:53.000
And that means that it has two
teeth with which to bite down on

00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:00.000
the metal center.
It is a double Lewis base.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
And when it binds to the metal
center, we call that the process

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:08.000
of chelation.
When a bidentate or a

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
multidentate,
which would be maybe a

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.000
tridentate or a tetradentate
ligand, binds to a metal through

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:20.000
multiple points,
we call that a ligand chelate.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
And we call the process one of
chelation that forms these ring

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
structures with the metal as
part of the ring produced

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:37.000
through multipoint binding of
the ligand to the metal center.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
And you are going to see that
it is possible to have all kinds

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:45.000
of different architectures for
ligands in proteins or in

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000
synthetic systems.
And the reason that I carried

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
out over here earlier is one in
which I added three equivalents

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000
of a bidentate ligand to this
solution of iron two plus.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:01.000
And, when that occurred,

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:07.000
this bidentate ligand displaced
the water molecules from the

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
inner coordination sphere of the
metal.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
And the bidentate ligand that I
used was this one.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
This is a very common chelating
ligand, a planar aromatic

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000
ligand.
And you can see that,

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:31.000
like ethylenediamine,
its architecture promotes the

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:39.000
pointing of a pair of electrons
toward the same point in space.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000
So that this ligand can bind
itself to a metal center through

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000
two nitrogen lone pairs
simultaneously.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:51.000
And it is the interaction of
the d-electrons on the iron

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
center with the unsaturated pi
system of this organic ligand

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
that produces the red color in
ways that we are going to

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
explore in more detail in one of
our next lectures.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:08.000
But, before we do that,
we are going to need to

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:10.000
understand something about
d-orbitals.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
And, as you have learned,
when you are forming molecular

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
orbitals in systems that consist
of either s or p orbitals,

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
you needed to know something
about the nodal properties of

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
those atomic orbitals in order
to build proper molecular

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
orbitals.
And that will certainly be the

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
case for these more interesting
elements that have d orbitals.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Not just s and p valance
orbitals, but also a set of

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000
d-orbitals.
And I call those the 3d

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
elements because their principle
quantum number for those

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
elements is three.
And what we need to now know is

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000
what do these orbitals have,
as far as nodal properties,

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
depending on the other quantum
numbers?

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
And I will draw a set of
coordinate axes,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
here, on which to map these
orbitals.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:26.000
It should be pretty
straightforward for you to keep

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
straight the nodal properties of
the d orbitals of which there is

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:34.000
a set of five.
We had one s orbital for a

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:39.000
given valance shell,
and we had a set of three p

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:45.000
orbitals, and there is a set of
five d orbitals for the d-block

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
elements.
And they can have different

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
values for the quantum number m.
One is zero.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
One is plus one.
One is plus two.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:03.000
And m can be minus one,
and m can equal minus two.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:08.000
And this quantum number
determines the angular nodal

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:13.000
properties of the d orbital in
question.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Here, let's draw a fairly
simple one.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Let's say that we have x,
y, and z.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Then what we might have is a d
orbital that looks like this.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
d orbitals often have four
lobes.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:45.000
In fact, you will see that we
represent four of the d orbitals

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:51.000
this way and not the fifth.
And let me use this pink to

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:58.000
represent the negative phase.
And so this orbital here is

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.000
(d)xz.
And that means that it has

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
nodes.
You have two planes that are

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000
nodes for a (d)xz orbital.
And one of these is the

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
x,y-plane.
And then the other one is the

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
y,z-plane.
Those are planes when you go

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:22.000
from one side through one of
those planes to the other side.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:28.000
The wave function changes sign.
And, just like each p orbital

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:34.000
has a single nodal plane,
each d orbital has two.

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000
And this is (d)xz.
And we can also have one that

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.000
we call d x squared minus y
squared.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000
And that one lies right along
the coordinate axes like this,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
with the four lobes being
skewered by the x-axis and the

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
y-axis.
And we have negative phase

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:00.000
located along y for the d x
squared minus y squared.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
And you can see that the nodal

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000
surfaces here both contain z.
The nodes contain the z-axis

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
and bisect the x and y
coordinate axes.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:19.000
There is one plane up here that
contains the z-axis and one over

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
there located at 90 degrees to
the first one.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Those are the nodal planes for
d x squared minus y squared.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.000
In addition to that (d)xz

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:40.000
orbital, I have a (d)yz orbital,
which is located with its lobes

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:44.000
lying between the y and z
coordinate axes.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:49.000
And it will have phasing as
indicated here in pink.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
That is (d)yz.
And it looks exactly like

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000
(d)xz.
And it is just rotated by 90

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:02.000
degrees around the z-axis
relative to (d)xz.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
And then, finally,
we have one that looks just

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:11.000
like d x squared minus
y squared.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.000
And this one is (d)xy.
And, like d x squared minus y

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
squared, the (d)xy orbital lies
in the x,y-plane.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:26.000
And its lobes point between the
axes, as shown here with that

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
phasing.
And then, finally --

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.000
And we will return to this
point next week.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Our m equals zero orbital is
our d z squared **d(z^2)**.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:44.000
And d z squared lies along and
is skewered by the z-axis.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:49.000
It looks like a p orbital,
except the sign is the same on

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
top and on bottom.
And then it has this beautiful

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
torus here that is in the
x,y-plane like that,

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:03.000
so that its nodal surfaces are
actually conical rather than

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:07.000
planes.
That is our set of five d

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.000
orbitals with which we are going
to do a lot more to understand

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000
the chemistry and coordination
complexes.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Have a great break,
and please don't forget to read

00:50:21.205 --> 00:50:24.000

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.100
HONG LIU: OK, let us start.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.730
So let me first
remind you what we

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.190
did at the end of last lecture.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.640
So we start talking
about how to calculate

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:45.420
the Euclidean
correlation functions

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.370
or how to relate the
Euclidean correlation

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.895
functions in the boundary field
series to the bulk quantity.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.710
So the question we are always
interested in-- so the question

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.407
we are always interested
in in the field theory

00:01:06.407 --> 00:01:07.615
is the generating functional.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.030
And so this is defined,
say, in the Euclidean series

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.355
to be-- we insert this.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.750
You insert this information
into your Lagrangian.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.720
And then you just calculate
the correlation function

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.360
of this exponential, OK?

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.950
So even if I write down a single
field phi, single source phi,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.800
and a single operator-- so you
should really understand this

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.580
as the collapsing of
all possible operators--

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.770
all possible operators and all
possible corresponding sources

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.062
you can put in.

00:02:01.062 --> 00:02:02.770
And those are a lot
of important things--

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.790
is that you should imagine this
exponential as a power series,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:08.650
OK?

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.750
So this expression should-- for
the purpose of the generating

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:12.740
functional.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.160
And this exponential
should be understood

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.010
as a power series in phi.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.380
So we expand it in phi.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.080
And then the term
proportion to phi,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.290
then gives you the one-point
function proportion to phi

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.770
squared, give you the
two-point function of O.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.565
And the cubic term would
be the three-point function

00:02:34.565 --> 00:02:35.940
of O, et cetera.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:42.120
And so this should--
yeah, this exponential

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.930
does not need to make
sense non-perturbatively.

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.690
You only need to make sense of
it as a power series of phi,

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:50.190
OK?

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.440
You only need to make
sense of it perturbatively

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.340
and then just given by the
correlation functions of O.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.340
OK, so this is a
power series of phi,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.490
which is the coefficient
given by the correlation

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.997
functions of O, OK?

00:03:03.997 --> 00:03:04.580
So this clear?

00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:17.460
And then we argued last time
that given the relation phi

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.230
x is related to some
operator to some field phi,

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.520
to the boundary value of phi.

00:03:31.488 --> 00:03:36.730
Yeah, given that,
say, the operator O

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.140
is related to some
bulk field phi

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.880
and the nominal
[INAUDIBLE] modes,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.820
the boundary value of phi
should be related to the source

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.710
corresponding to this o,
then you can in some sense

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.860
immediately write down what
this generating function should

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.220
correspond to on
the gravity side.

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.950
This can be conceivably
just a partition function

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.850
with this deformation--
with this deformation.

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.490
And then this should be
the same as the partition

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.480
function on the gravity side.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.250
Then we should expect
that CFT phi should

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.970
be the same as the gravity
partition function reaches

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:33.880
the boundary condition, OK?

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.890
So we expect this
to be true, OK?

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.890
And so this is just
a heuristic way

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:46.590
of writing the more
precise relation.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.160
For example, for scalar,
the way to understand

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.580
this is that phi
xz at z goes to 0

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:03.640
should goes to phi x
z d minus delta OK?

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.785
So this is a precise
mathematical meaning

00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:11.710
of this relation.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.100
So the boundary
value of capital phi

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.420
should be given
by the small phi.

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:18.720
And of course, depending
on different fields,

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.550
then this power
may be different.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.800
So last time, we
talked about the, say,

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.500
for conserved current, we
just do it to vector fields.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.500
And then this power will be 0.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.460
And then also for the
[INAUDIBLE] perturbation

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:37.410
will be a different
power, et cetera, OK?

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.960
So any questions regarding this?

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.210
Good.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:59.960
So now, the thing
is that in general,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.590
we cannot really verify this
relation because the right-hand

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:07.660
side is very hard to compute.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.330
Actually, we don't even know how
to define the right-hand side

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:14.390
in the full quantum
gravitational regime.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.440
And it's just a
formal expression.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.330
Say for quantum gravity
exist, then maybe there should

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:24.140
exist a partition function, OK?

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:26.290
But there is a
regime-- we do know

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.570
how to calculate this side.

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.710
So this is so-called
classical gravity regime

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.900
or also called semi
classical regime.

00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:43.790
In the semi classical
regime, which

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:49.060
is the limit which
alpha prime goes to 0

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.590
and the G newton goes
to 0 or similarly gs

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:57.400
go to-- string
coupling goes to zero.

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.810
And in this limit, one can
formally write this z bulk just

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:08.490
as a Euclidean path integral
of all the bulk fields.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:19.680
OK, so now I use the convention
for the Euclidean path integral

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:23.140
without the minus sign.

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.830
So we just integrate, say--
so this is your action.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:30.730
Then you integrate over all
possible gravity fields.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:33.370
Again, this should be
integrated as a collection

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.970
of all the fields
on the gravity side,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:39.550
including whatever scalar field,
gravity, vector field-- you

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.220
catch everything, OK?

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.529
And there'll be some appropriate
boundary condition-- OK, so

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:46.820
appropriate boundary condition.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:59.080
And so this SE-- so this SE,
just the Euclidean action--

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.300
standard Euclidean action.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.120
Say the Einstein
term and the plus--

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.270
say the matter terms, OK.

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:24.010
And then the leading order in
this limit-- and the meeting

00:08:24.010 --> 00:08:26.100
order in that
limit, you can just

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:33.299
perform this integral by
saddle point of approximation,

00:08:33.299 --> 00:08:35.429
which is say, alpha
prime goes to 0 limit,

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.440
kappa goes to 0 limit.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.361
OK, kappa is essentially
the G newton.

00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:41.986
So you can calculate
this path integral

00:08:41.986 --> 00:08:47.760
by saddle point approximation.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.800
Just solve the equation motion
following from this action, OK?

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:56.049
I assume you all know what's
saddle point approximation.

00:08:56.049 --> 00:08:58.090
So the saddle point
approximation you just solve.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:08.740
So z bulk-- that's given by SE.

00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:10.460
Now you evaluate
it at the solution

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:11.970
of the classical
equation motion.

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:18.540
So phi c is just a
classical solution.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.301
It's a classic solution which
satisfies the right boundary

00:09:31.301 --> 00:09:31.800
condition.

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:41.830
Correct boundary condition, OK?

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.270
So in this limit, we can
really calculate this quantity.

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.040
And this is very good news.

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.950
This is very good
news because this

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:16.490
limit-- because this limit is
the-- what did we say before?

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:17.920
N equal to infinity.

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:24.019
And the lambda goes to infinity
limit of the boundary theory

00:10:24.019 --> 00:10:25.310
of the super Yang-Mills theory.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:43.630
OK, so we can actually--
so given this,

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.900
then essentially we know
the generating functional.

00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:49.360
Then we can actually calculate
the correlation functions

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:53.350
in the strongly coupled
field series, OK?

00:10:56.850 --> 00:11:00.670
And it's just by solving the
classical gravity equation,

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.735
just by solving the
classical gravity equations.

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:14.600
So we conclude-- this is
an important equation.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.560
So let me write it here.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:22.280
Yes, so let me just make a small
remark-- make a small remark.

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:29.790
So to [? read in ?] order,
this correlation function

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:33.150
essentially is controlled by
this 1 over 2 kappa square.

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:34.860
So this is 1 over 2 newton.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:45.610
So remember that
previously, we--

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:48.560
when we talk about relation
between the G newton

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.570
and the field theory relation,
this is proportional to N

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:57.050
square, N square of
the [INAUDIBLE] theory.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:12:00.230
And this is indeed consistent.

00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:02.756
So in the saddle point
approximation, the SE,

00:12:02.756 --> 00:12:06.160
this is just controlled by 1
over 2 kappa square when we

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.170
just [? put it ?] to N square.

00:12:08.170 --> 00:12:10.370
And this is indeed consistent
with our expectation

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:14.630
from [INAUDIBLE] theory that the
leading order, the generating

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.880
functional, should be
proportional to N square, OK?

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.088
We support for normalization.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.960
OK, so now we have obtained
something powerful.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.870
So now we have obtained
something very powerful.

00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:34.750
It said in the N
equal to infinity

00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:44.180
and the lambda goes to infinity
limit, the logarithm of CFT,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:58.280
the generating functional,
is related to-- we

00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:00.639
said the boundary condition,
the boundary value.

00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:02.180
Yeah, this is the
boundary condition.

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.080
Yeah, maybe.

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.640
Just, we have this,
which is the boundary

00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:19.800
value which phi c goes to
z to some power of phi x.

00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.390
And thus, z goes to 0, OK?

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.560
OK?

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:36.710
And this is the part of the
[? non-normalizable ?] mode

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:41.280
for this bulk field phi, OK?

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:46.730
And this a-- so this
precise number a

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:53.350
depends on-- so this
exponent a depends on, say,

00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:55.120
dimension of the operator.

00:13:58.630 --> 00:14:03.430
Dimension, spin-- say,
possible other quantum numbers

00:14:03.430 --> 00:14:03.985
of operator.

00:14:09.370 --> 00:14:15.210
So for scalar, we just have this
guy, which we just wrote, OK?

00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:21.060
And so let me remind
you for the vector,

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:30.170
for the conserved current,
which is due to a vector field,

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:35.380
to a gauge field, to a
massless vector field--

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:40.230
and then this gives
you a equal to 0.

00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:44.260
Yeah, maybe this just gives
you a equal to 0 in this case.

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:46.420
So the leading,
non-normalizable term--

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:50.360
so just the boundary
value of the vector field

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.780
is just given by the
source to the current.

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:59.990
And for the metric, we
discussed last time,

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.087
is that for the
metric perturbation,

00:15:03.087 --> 00:15:04.545
we just do it to
the stress tensor.

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:14.760
So this is corresponding
to a equal to 2, OK?

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:19.260
So where this comes from is
that, remember-- and last time,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.780
we say that A mu-- say if
you have a gauge field,

00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:27.500
say a [? mass ?] term, when
you go to the boundary,

00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:33.530
then you get a mu then
plus some b mu Z d minus 2.

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.960
So you see, there's no power
here, Z equal to 0 here, OK?

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.100
Similarly for the metric,
component of the metric,

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:47.590
go to 0, goes to 1
over Z square, say,

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:48.520
the boundary value.

00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:58.170
And the boundaries--
yeah, delta g mu

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:07.490
is the source to the-- for
[? T mu. ?] So here, the a is

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:10.700
actually equal to minus 2.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.104
Or a equal to 2, yeah--
a equal to minus 2.

00:16:18.104 --> 00:16:18.645
That's right.

00:16:21.381 --> 00:16:21.880
OK?

00:16:27.894 --> 00:16:28.810
Any questions on this?

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:42.050
Now let me make some remarks.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:58.100
So the first remark is what
I said a little bit earlier.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:07.589
It's that the phi x in
this generating functional

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:09.459
should be considered
as infinitesimal.

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.430
OK?

00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:27.614
So the reason we want
to consider same term

00:17:27.614 --> 00:17:28.780
is that what we said before.

00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.410
We said we should consider
the generating functional

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.580
simply just as a power series.

00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:36.220
Because we don't want
to take on perturbation

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:39.826
to deform your regional
series, to actually change

00:17:39.826 --> 00:17:40.700
your regional series.

00:17:40.700 --> 00:17:44.259
We just use it as a
generating function.

00:17:44.259 --> 00:17:46.300
So similarly, the same
thing should be considered

00:17:46.300 --> 00:17:49.860
the gravity side, OK?

00:17:49.860 --> 00:18:02.160
So similarly on the
gravity side-- so this phi

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.050
is due to the
non-normalizable mode.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:08.653
So this non-normalizable mode
should also be infinitesimal.

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:34.330
OK, so don't disturb your
asymptotic ADS geometry.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.280
OK, any questions?

00:18:49.130 --> 00:18:50.130
So this is first remark.

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:11.560
The second remark-- now
let me call this equation.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.810
Let me give the equation name.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:32.267
It said that both sides of star
are actually divergent, OK?

00:19:32.267 --> 00:19:33.225
Are actually divergent.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:44.220
So the left-hand side,
for a very simple reason,

00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:47.800
we are considering a
quantum field theory.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.380
We are considering a generating
function of composite operators

00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:53.750
in a quantum field theory.

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:56.530
They're always short distance
divergences when the two

00:19:56.530 --> 00:20:00.290
operators come together, OK?

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:10.680
So this is just the usual
uv divergences of a QFT.

00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.500
On the right-hand
side, we will see soon

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.775
in the example this
is also divergent.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:32.976
And the reason it's divergent
is also we have seen it before.

00:20:32.976 --> 00:20:36.115
So remember the ADS
metric is like this.

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:43.850
OK, so I write all boundary
directions together

00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:46.870
in terms of dx squared.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.240
So because when Z-- when you go
to the boundary, Z goes to 0.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:52.360
And then the whole
metric blows up.

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.500
So essentially, you
have infinite volume.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:59.710
And yeah, essentially--
so roughly you

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:08.440
can say this is a volume
divergence near boundary

00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:18.390
of ADS, OK?

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:22.230
So the relation between
them, of course,

00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:27.770
is precisely what we
called IR uv connection.

00:21:27.770 --> 00:21:31.650
So the IR-- so the volume
divergences associated, say,

00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:33.830
with the space time
have infinite volume

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:38.178
is related to the uv divergences
in the field series sites, OK?

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.930
So in order to actually
obtain the finite answer,

00:21:47.930 --> 00:21:49.370
we need to renormalize them.

00:21:58.890 --> 00:22:00.197
We need to renormalize them.

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:18.600
So the idea to role match
them from the field theory

00:22:18.600 --> 00:22:21.700
point of view,
essentially, you need

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:27.350
to add some counterterms to
cancel the divergences, OK?

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:31.320
You need to add the counterterms
to cancel the divergences.

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.740
So the similar logic we
do on the gravity side.

00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:39.230
So that means that in order to
make sense of this expression,

00:22:39.230 --> 00:22:46.820
we introduce a
renormalized action

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:52.195
which is defined by your
original action-- say,

00:22:52.195 --> 00:22:53.950
the [INAUDIBLE] action.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.670
But this is divergence.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.440
So we first need
to regularize it.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.270
So we normally do
regularization.

00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:03.300
So instead of
evaluating all the way

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.830
to z equal to 0, which
will be divergent,

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:10.360
we cut it off at some
z equal to epsilon.

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.430
So this is your full space time.

00:23:13.430 --> 00:23:15.580
So z equal to 0 is,
again, your boundary.

00:23:19.176 --> 00:23:21.050
So you integrate all
the way to z equal to 0.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.870
You will get a divergence.

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:27.800
So we just cut it off at
a z equal to epsilon, OK?

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:37.150
And then we added
the counterterm,

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.180
which can be expressed
in terms of the phi

00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:43.350
c evaluated at this epsilon, OK?

00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:49.590
And this [? displaced ?] row
should cancel the divergence

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.640
here, OK?

00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.050
Should cancel divergence here.

00:23:54.050 --> 00:23:56.900
But this St is
much-- so St should

00:23:56.900 --> 00:23:58.240
satisfy some simple criterion.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:08.430
In principle, this
St can be arbitrary,

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:11.470
but should satisfy
some criterion.

00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:28.320
First, this must be local
functionals of phi c, OK?

00:24:33.970 --> 00:24:38.478
The reason it must be
local functionals of phi c

00:24:38.478 --> 00:24:41.685
is because this should come
from short distance physics.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.900
And short distance
physics is not

00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:47.610
something we can
really control even

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:49.091
in the renormalizable theories.

00:24:49.091 --> 00:24:50.590
Even in the
renormalizable theories,

00:24:50.590 --> 00:24:55.240
we just look at
the quantity which

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.345
are insensitive to those
short distance physics.

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:06.510
So the short distance physics,
not something we can control.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:08.890
But one important thing
about short distance physics

00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:14.900
is that they all must come
from a single point, OK?

00:25:14.900 --> 00:25:19.350
So it means the counterterm
you act must be local, OK?

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.330
And of course must be
covariant, et cetera.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:25.700
So local, covariant-- satisfy
those basic conditions

00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:29.755
and the covariant, et cetera,
with all the right symmetry.

00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:34.890
Essentially, this is
the only condition

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:38.194
those counterterms
should satisfy.

00:25:38.194 --> 00:25:40.110
And then you can just
choose your counterterms

00:25:40.110 --> 00:25:44.650
to cancel the divergent
terms here, OK?

00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:48.240
But now the key
thing is that this

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:52.850
is different from just throwing
away the divergent term here.

00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:58.630
Because this counterterm also
contain some finite terms.

00:25:58.630 --> 00:26:01.720
So that's normally, in
the [INAUDIBLE] field

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:04.110
series, that may change
the finite terms here.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:06.370
And those finite
terms are constrained

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:08.200
by the locality
and the covariant

00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.620
and [? those ?] symmetries.

00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.200
And actually, there's no
ambiguity in them, OK?

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.780
Even though the divergent
term, in some sense,

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:16.730
there's ambiguity.

00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:18.880
But in the finite term,
there's no ambiguity.

00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:22.630
And so we will see an example
at the end of this class.

00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.870
OK, so we need to
renormalize them.

00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:32.670
And this is the criterion
to normalize it, OK?

00:26:32.670 --> 00:26:35.500
So once we have
renormalized it, then we

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:38.980
can just obtain the
n-point function.

00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:50.460
So the general
n-point function--

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:58.890
say, oy x1, on xn-- if you
look at this n-point function,

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:01.340
so let's say
connected, then we'll

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:04.610
be just corresponding
to the standard story.

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:11.515
You just take n derivatives
on the partition function, not

00:27:11.515 --> 00:27:14.430
the normalized one.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:19.870
OK, so you take derivative
over phi 1 corresponding to o1

00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:22.030
and then phi 2
corresponding to o2,

00:27:22.030 --> 00:27:27.410
et cetera, and the phi
n corresponding to xn.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:29.060
And then at the end
of the calculation,

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:32.480
after you have done
the derivative,

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.760
you set all the phi to 0, OK?

00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:43.700
So then you have extracted
n-point function, OK?

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.550
So this is the same
that you expand

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:49.750
that exponential in power series
and then only extract terms

00:27:49.750 --> 00:27:51.800
power n in phi, OK?

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:54.110
So same thing.

00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:57.180
And now because this
is now equal to that--

00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:01.040
so we can write this in
terms of gravity quantities.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.120
So writing as n-point
function of SE

00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:17.790
will normalize SE as a function
phi c, now phi 1 x1, phi n xn.

00:28:17.790 --> 00:28:21.470
Then at the end, you
take phi equal to 0, OK?

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:25.580
All the phi to 0, OK?

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:31.900
So now you in principle, by
calculating the gravity action

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.520
with the appropriate
boundary condition,

00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:39.104
then you would have obtained
any n-point functions

00:28:39.104 --> 00:28:40.020
from the field theory.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.470
Any questions about this?

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.220
Yes.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:54.845
AUDIENCE: Can we check that
relations start on the lattice?

00:28:57.344 --> 00:28:58.510
HONG LIU: Can we check that?

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:01.170
Yeah, in principle, you can.

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:02.975
But it's just not easy to do.

00:29:02.975 --> 00:29:06.300
AUDIENCE: Have people tried?

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.620
HONG LIU: So people have
tried, not for super Yang-Mills

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.200
series.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.720
So there's some version of
these for some matrix quantum

00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.750
mechanics.

00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:17.597
People have tried.

00:29:17.597 --> 00:29:19.680
In matrix quantum mechanics
on the left-hand side,

00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:22.520
you can actually calculate
using the lattice

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.450
or using Monte Carlo.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:24.800
So maybe not lattice.

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:26.800
It's just a matrix integral.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:30.580
You can calculate it
using a Monte Carlo

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:32.840
and then can compare
with the gravity.

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.850
Then they turned out to agree
with very high accuracy.

00:29:38.446 --> 00:29:40.570
But for super Yang-Mills
series, the left-hand side

00:29:40.570 --> 00:29:46.770
is not doable yet using
lattice calculation.

00:29:46.770 --> 00:29:49.910
So-- and the one
particularly important thing

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:51.830
is the one-point function.

00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:55.790
So maybe just separate
it to mention elliptics.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:57.220
So one-point
function is important

00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.500
because one-point
function just expectation

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:06.362
value, which of course we
often are interested in.

00:30:06.362 --> 00:30:07.820
So if you have a
symmetry breaking,

00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:09.710
whether you develop
expectation value

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:13.040
or if you want to extract the
expectation value of a stress

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.360
tensor, et cetera.

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.720
So the one-point function is
of very special importance

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.290
in many cases.

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:22.290
And also, if you know
the one-point function

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.650
in the presence of the
source, then essentially,

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.840
you actually know the
full n-point function.

00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.050
Because you can just take
the derivatives here.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.680
Then you can get to the
higher point functions because

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:36.536
of the-- yeah, if you
know the source here,

00:30:36.536 --> 00:30:38.160
if you take one
derivative, now you get

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.760
two-point function, et cetera.

00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.980
OK?

00:30:41.980 --> 00:30:44.230
So one-point
function-- so one-point

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.540
function we can write
as the following.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:53.806
So you just take one
derivative, delta phi

00:30:53.806 --> 00:30:58.900
x, due to this operator, OK?

00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:01.490
So now let's do the scalar case.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:06.300
But similar can be
applied to other case, OK?

00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:09.890
So you can just
replace this phi x

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:15.035
by the boundary
value of capital phi.

00:31:17.660 --> 00:31:19.970
So this is for the scalar case.

00:31:19.970 --> 00:31:27.340
And you could write it
as delta SE of phi c.

00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:35.300
On the right I said,
derivative over phi c z, x.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:38.230
And as z goes to 0.

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:43.200
Because phi c has to
approach phi with this power.

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.200
And essentially, you
just replace it, OK?

00:31:47.819 --> 00:31:50.360
But the reason we want to write
this form-- because this form

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:52.109
have a very nice
geometric interpretation.

00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:00.290
This has a very nice
geometric interpretation

00:32:00.290 --> 00:32:17.766
because delta SE, delta
phi c evaluated at z, x

00:32:17.766 --> 00:32:23.320
should be equal to phi c z, x.

00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:35.490
And this pi, which is
the canonical momentum

00:32:35.490 --> 00:32:52.460
conjugate to phi treating
the z direction as time.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:02.090
This z direction
treating as time.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:06.810
And so this pi c just means
it's the classical-- means

00:33:06.810 --> 00:33:12.960
that this is evaluated to
the classical solution--

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.600
classical solution phi c.

00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:25.180
So this expression-- is this
expression obvious to you?

00:33:29.419 --> 00:33:31.774
AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:31.774 --> 00:33:33.190
Just from the other graphs.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.793
HONG LIU: Hm?

00:33:33.793 --> 00:33:36.168
AUDIENCE: It's just [INAUDIBLE]
conjugation, essentially,

00:33:36.168 --> 00:33:37.110
right?

00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:43.930
HONG LIU: Yeah, this is
the-- yeah, actually,

00:33:43.930 --> 00:33:46.450
I forgot the name
of this equation.

00:33:46.450 --> 00:33:49.610
Maybe it's-- normally
this equation is taught

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:53.000
in the so-called
Hamilton-Jacobi theory.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.325
It's normally called in
the Hamilton-Jacobi theory.

00:33:57.325 --> 00:34:00.120
But this is a well-known fact
in the classical mechanics.

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.380
Let me just tell you one thing.

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.960
So consider you have a, say,
classical mechanical system.

00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:12.969
So you move from t0 to t1, OK?

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:14.550
And then suppose
you have already

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:16.370
found your classical solution.

00:34:16.370 --> 00:34:20.730
So this is a
classical trajectory.

00:34:20.730 --> 00:34:24.780
And then suppose you evaluate
your classical action.

00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:33.060
Say so this is t0 to t1 dt,
all evaluated at Xc, Xc dot, et

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.650
cetera, OK?

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:38.040
Xc is already
classical solution.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:44.350
And so this function-- and
let's suppose that Xc at t0

00:34:44.350 --> 00:34:49.530
is equal to X0, Xc
at t1 equal to X1.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:55.260
So this is the initial
value and the final value

00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:56.940
of your trajectory, OK?

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:03.970
And then-- so clearly, because
of this boundary condition,

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:09.600
the S depends on X0 and X1.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:12.360
Then this is an
important statement

00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.440
in classical mechanics--
is that delta S,

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:24.710
you do the valuation over the
final value of your location.

00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:29.320
This gives you the momentum
at that point at P1.

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:36.860
And if you do the
valuation over delta X0,

00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.500
then that gives you the initial
momentum, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:43.240
or the initial momentum,
at this point, OK?

00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:48.755
So if you're not
familiar with this fact,

00:35:48.755 --> 00:35:53.770
try to derive it yourself
when you go home.

00:35:53.770 --> 00:35:57.220
Take two minutes to derive it.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:59.980
If you find the right
the way to do it,

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.310
it's actually very simple.

00:36:02.310 --> 00:36:05.400
Yeah, but it's also in the
chapter 1 of Landau, Lifshitz.

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.760
And it's very-- essentially
the first few pages

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.310
of Landau, Lifshitz.

00:36:10.310 --> 00:36:12.430
You can also take
a look at that.

00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:16.730
And now this situation we have
here is very similar to that.

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:20.390
So we are evaluating the
classical action all the way

00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:22.430
to some value of z.

00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:26.750
And z essentially is the
boundary-- is the time here.

00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:31.170
And the phi c is the value
of phi at this value of z,

00:36:31.170 --> 00:36:34.892
which is the analog
of our X1 here, OK?

00:36:34.892 --> 00:36:37.100
Then you take the derivative--
so this is a function,

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.933
a version with that.

00:36:37.933 --> 00:36:40.750
Then you take the
derivative over phi c,

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:45.690
which is the value-- because
[? one you ?] take derivative

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:46.620
over X1.

00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:47.840
Then here, you get the P1.

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.013
There, you get equals 1 in
momentum conjugate to phi, OK?

00:36:51.013 --> 00:36:52.971
So this is just the
functional version of that.

00:36:56.130 --> 00:36:59.237
Any questions on this?

00:36:59.237 --> 00:37:00.945
So now we have a very
elegant expression.

00:37:06.834 --> 00:37:08.125
We said the one-point function.

00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:13.750
We said now, if you
look at this-- now,

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:19.530
the one-point function-- so even
in the presence of the source,

00:37:19.530 --> 00:37:24.190
you just z equal to 0
limit-- z to the power

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:30.450
d minus delta, pi c z, x.

00:37:30.450 --> 00:37:32.110
And of course,
this should also be

00:37:32.110 --> 00:37:39.550
renormalized because of
here, we renormalized R.

00:37:39.550 --> 00:37:41.590
So here, it should
also be renormalized.

00:37:41.590 --> 00:37:43.790
And so here-- yeah, OK?

00:37:51.698 --> 00:37:54.190
Yeah, so this is
a nice expression.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:57.946
So it tells you that
the one-point function

00:37:57.946 --> 00:37:59.320
you see essentially
just goes one

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:07.370
into a limit of the canonical
momentum to that field

00:38:07.370 --> 00:38:10.168
evaluated at the boundary, OK?

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:20.180
So now, with a
little bit of effort,

00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:28.630
we will show-- so you
remember phi x, z,

00:38:28.630 --> 00:38:34.020
when you go to z equal to 0, as
we said last time equal to Ax,

00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.455
you have two
asymptotic behavior.

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.570
So this A is related
to the source.

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:49.320
So A is related to the phi.

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:55.750
So we discussed last time A
is related to the phi, OK?

00:38:55.750 --> 00:39:00.470
So now you can show,
using this expression,

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:04.690
that the one-point
function is actually

00:39:04.690 --> 00:39:11.550
exactly equal to 2 nu times B.

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:14.790
And the nu-- yeah, let me
just introduce my notation,

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:17.120
remind you of which we
had been used last time.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.990
You said the delta.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.350
So last time, we
derived this delta

00:39:21.350 --> 00:39:24.736
equal to d divided by 2 plus nu.

00:39:24.736 --> 00:39:29.610
And the nu is equal
to d squared over 4

00:39:29.610 --> 00:39:33.200
plus m squared R squared
for scalar fields, OK?

00:39:36.750 --> 00:39:40.860
So you can show--
so we will do that.

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.890
We will reach this point at
the end of this class, OK?

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:48.510
So you show that actually, the
one-point function precisely

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.200
is given by B.

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.260
So this is very nice.

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:53.630
This is very nice.

00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:56.070
So you have two
asymptotic behavior.

00:39:56.070 --> 00:39:58.860
And one of them is
related to the source.

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.650
And the other is related to
the expectation value, OK?

00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:17.500
And so I urge you to do a
self-consistency check yourself

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:22.210
as we did last time that the
[INAUDIBLE] you can determine

00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:27.221
the dimension of this operator,
which is precisely delta.

00:40:27.221 --> 00:40:28.720
And from this
relation, you can also

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:31.470
check that this
relation is compatible.

00:40:31.470 --> 00:40:34.840
We said O have
dimension delta, OK?

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.210
And delta are given
by that delta.

00:40:38.210 --> 00:40:43.020
Again, this you can check just
by the scaling the two side,

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:47.680
the how two sides scale
under the scaling, OK?

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.316
AUDIENCE: So usually
in QFT there's

00:40:49.316 --> 00:40:52.360
no relation between
the conjugate momentum

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.720
and one-point function?

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:57.622
There's no kind of a--

00:40:57.622 --> 00:40:58.330
HONG LIU: No, no.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:01.840
No, this is conjugate
momentum in the gravity side.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:02.420
This is not--

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:05.490
AUDIENCE: So within
QFT, there isn't any--

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.240
HONG LIU: No, this is the
gravity canonical momentum

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.552
related to the field
theory one-point function.

00:41:11.552 --> 00:41:14.010
This has nothing to do with
canonical momentum on the field

00:41:14.010 --> 00:41:14.970
theory side.

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.750
So this is the canonical
momentum on the gravity side.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.590
The boundary value of
the canonical momentum

00:41:21.590 --> 00:41:24.190
on the gravity side with
the rate of direction

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.490
treated as the time, which
gives you the one-point function

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:28.645
in the field theory.

00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.060
Good.

00:41:42.654 --> 00:41:43.410
Good, OK.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:46.880
So now let's look at
them more explicitly.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:48.920
So let's now give you
an example to compute

00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:55.680
the two-point function
for scalar operator.

00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.930
And then we'll also
derive this relation.

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:02.520
We'll also derive
this relation, OK?

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.015
So before we do that, do
you have any questions?

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:09.940
Yeah.

00:42:09.940 --> 00:42:13.262
AUDIENCE: I guess
usually in QFT,

00:42:13.262 --> 00:42:16.664
when you have Gaussian integrals
and one-point function is

00:42:16.664 --> 00:42:21.660
0, in what case does
this happen here?

00:42:21.660 --> 00:42:24.990
HONG LIU: Say-- in
many cases, in QFT--

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:30.790
so if you have any state
with a non-zero [? energy, ?]

00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:33.070
any state above the
ground state where you

00:42:33.070 --> 00:42:35.170
have a non-zero stress tensor.

00:42:35.170 --> 00:42:38.490
And then the stress tensor
will have a one-point function.

00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:41.540
And so for example, if you
have a symmetry breaking

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:44.645
in the scalar fields, we also
have expectation value, yeah.

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:50.280
And also, if you have
charge density, than

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.969
the current will have
expectation value.

00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:53.469
Yeah.

00:42:58.050 --> 00:43:00.310
Any other questions?

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:04.390
So yeah, actually,
before we do the example,

00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:07.097
let me also make a brief
remark why we actually first

00:43:07.097 --> 00:43:09.055
considered the Euclidean
correlation functions.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:17.420
So now first, can
I ask the reason

00:43:17.420 --> 00:43:20.598
why we want to do the Euclidean
correlation function first?

00:43:24.530 --> 00:43:25.030
Hm?

00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.946
AUDIENCE: It's easier?

00:43:31.558 --> 00:43:33.430
HONG LIU: It's true.

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:33.930
It's true.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.470
And why it's easier?

00:43:43.541 --> 00:43:44.040
Hm?

00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.270
AUDIENCE: You can--

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:46.120
HONG LIU: Sorry?

00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.700
AUDIENCE: Usually
Euclidean takes less time.

00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:49.560
HONG LIU: It's true.

00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:54.390
Yeah, so there's several
reasons maybe to save time.

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:57.190
Actually, we don't
have much time.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:03.186
Several reasons-- first
Euclidean interval,

00:44:03.186 --> 00:44:05.435
you can more easily define
it using the Euclidean path

00:44:05.435 --> 00:44:07.580
integral.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.330
And so there's no ordering
issues, et cetera.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:14.402
And we just have Euclidean
correlation functions.

00:44:14.402 --> 00:44:16.110
But the Lorentzian
correlation functions,

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:17.500
there are many of them.

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.820
So it depends on the
orderings, et cetera.

00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:23.870
And the typical Lorentzian
function cannot be defined

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:26.190
straightforwardly
using path integral.

00:44:26.190 --> 00:44:28.140
So except the Feynman
correlation functions,

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:29.417
say time-ordered.

00:44:29.417 --> 00:44:32.000
So if you want to look at other
ordered correlation functions,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.770
they cannot be defined
straightforward.

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:35.945
They cannot be defined
straightforward using path

00:44:35.945 --> 00:44:37.020
integral.

00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:39.180
And so it's much
more complicated.

00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:42.570
Actually, for many
applications-- in particular,

00:44:42.570 --> 00:44:46.990
say, for the linear response
for the many body system--

00:44:46.990 --> 00:44:48.760
say for condensed
matter or for QCD,

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:51.160
et cetera, mostly we're
interested in the retarded

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.350
Green function.

00:44:52.350 --> 00:44:55.130
And that is not easy to
define using path integral.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:58.250
And so you need to
develop some other tricks.

00:44:58.250 --> 00:45:00.574
So that's why we are
doing the Euclidean first.

00:45:00.574 --> 00:45:01.073
OK?

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:16.547
So now let's look at example
two-point function of a scalar,

00:45:16.547 --> 00:45:17.046
OK?

00:45:23.047 --> 00:45:24.880
So this is essentially
the simplest example.

00:45:29.230 --> 00:45:34.940
And for a two-point
function, they only

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:39.124
need to have the
quadratic term in phi, OK?

00:45:39.124 --> 00:45:40.540
And that means
here, you only need

00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:43.520
to include the quadratic
term in capital phi.

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:46.640
So that means it's enough
just to consider the action

00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:48.955
to the quadratic reliable, OK?

00:45:48.955 --> 00:45:50.580
So that means that
if we are interested

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:53.800
in the two-point function
to leading order, then

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.280
you can just look at
the quadratic action.

00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:00.780
And for scalar, then,
for scalar operator O,

00:46:00.780 --> 00:46:03.522
then you are just [INAUDIBLE]
massive scalar fields.

00:46:03.522 --> 00:46:05.105
So we can write down
Euclidean action.

00:46:31.230 --> 00:46:33.180
OK?

00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:36.740
You don't have to worry about
the higher order corrections.

00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.230
And then the metric is the
Euclidean version of this.

00:46:39.230 --> 00:46:42.250
It's just the Euclidean metric.

00:46:42.250 --> 00:46:46.270
And this is dx
squared-- so dx squared,

00:46:46.270 --> 00:46:48.640
Euclidean metric,
dx squared will

00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:52.000
be just delta [? mu ?]
mu, dx mu, dx mu.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.140
It's really just the
standard Euclidean metric.

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.690
So essentially, we
take the-- so here,

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:04.020
where previously
was minus dt squared

00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:05.790
plus the vector x square.

00:47:05.790 --> 00:47:08.680
Then we take that dt square
into Euclidean signature.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.710
Then it just becomes
a pure Euclidean.

00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:12.110
All right, I hope this is clear.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:28.920
And then our goal is just
find renormalized phi c using

00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:34.078
this action, which satisfies the
right boundary condition, OK?

00:47:34.078 --> 00:47:35.830
OK, so this is our goal.

00:47:35.830 --> 00:47:38.310
And if we find this guy,
then you take the derivative.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:39.684
Then you get
two-point functions.

00:47:44.860 --> 00:47:47.500
OK, first, let me--
first, you can write down

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:53.760
the canonical momentum with
the z as the time direction.

00:47:53.760 --> 00:48:01.235
So this is just-- OK, so
this is canonical momentum.

00:48:03.770 --> 00:48:18.490
Under the equation motion--
OK, equation motion.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:23.660
And again, because of
a translation symmetry

00:48:23.660 --> 00:48:26.890
in those X in the
boundary directions,

00:48:26.890 --> 00:48:30.421
we can write it in
the Fourier transform.

00:48:30.421 --> 00:48:38.620
You can write x, z
in the form of k, z--

00:48:38.620 --> 00:48:45.370
so [? expression ?] ikx, just as
we did last time when we solved

00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:47.890
the [? free ?] theory.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.795
Then this gives
you-- so you plug

00:48:49.795 --> 00:48:55.340
this in when you put in
the explicit metric here.

00:48:55.340 --> 00:49:01.310
Then you get z d plus
1 partial z z 1 minus

00:49:01.310 --> 00:49:11.800
d partial z phi minus
k squared z squared phi

00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:19.544
and then minus m square R
square phi equal to 0, OK?

00:49:33.230 --> 00:49:35.147
So this is very similar
to what we did before,

00:49:35.147 --> 00:49:37.688
what we did last time when we
talked about normalizable modes

00:49:37.688 --> 00:49:39.650
and non-normalizable modes.

00:49:39.650 --> 00:49:41.189
This is the same equation.

00:49:41.189 --> 00:49:43.730
The only difference is now we
are in the Euclidean signature.

00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:56.630
So this equation can
be solved exactly-- so

00:49:56.630 --> 00:49:58.990
in terms of Bessel functions.

00:49:58.990 --> 00:50:01.405
But actually, we will not need
the explicit solution here

00:50:01.405 --> 00:50:02.680
at the end.

00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:06.210
So for now, we will not try
to solve it explicitly, OK?

00:50:06.210 --> 00:50:09.440
So we only do that at the end.

00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.637
So now let's first look at
the on-shell action, OK?

00:50:13.637 --> 00:50:14.720
So there's a simple trick.

00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:18.350
Because this is a quadratic, you
can actually do an integration

00:50:18.350 --> 00:50:20.080
by part in the action.

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:28.900
So let's say plug in the-- let's
plug in the classical solution

00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:35.340
to this equation, to the classic
equation, into this action.

00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:37.465
So let's do an integration
by parts in this term.

00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:51.200
Then when you do integration by
parts, then you get two terms.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.310
You get a boundary term come
from integration by parts.

00:50:54.310 --> 00:50:55.762
Then you get the bulk term.

00:50:55.762 --> 00:50:57.970
So the bulk term can be
written in the following way.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:07.780
So let me first copy
the m square phi c term.

00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.510
And then it's the term which
you obtained by integration

00:51:10.510 --> 00:51:12.040
by part of that term.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:23.410
So that term can be
written as partial m

00:51:23.410 --> 00:51:38.380
and then plus the boundary term
plus the total derivative term.

00:51:49.954 --> 00:51:51.245
Just did a simple manipulation.

00:51:51.245 --> 00:51:52.950
I did integration by parts here.

00:51:56.170 --> 00:51:57.880
So now you recognize this guy.

00:52:00.747 --> 00:52:03.330
It's precisely the combination
which appeared in that equation

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:05.900
motion.

00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:12.520
This is always the case when
you have a quadratic action, OK?

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.080
So this is just 0.

00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.680
So we don't need to
worry about this.

00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:21.638
So this term just said
[? N ?] equal to 0 on shell.

00:52:21.638 --> 00:52:25.030
So this is just equal to 0.

00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:28.090
And so we only have
a boundary term.

00:52:28.090 --> 00:52:29.340
So this is a total derivative.

00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:32.530
But the boundary-- so we
always see the boundary term

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:35.317
in, say, the directions
along the boundary.

00:52:35.317 --> 00:52:37.150
So you only need to
worry about the boundary

00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:38.195
term in the z direction.

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:46.180
So then this just translated
into the z equal to 0

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:49.238
and the z equal to infinity, OK?

00:52:54.790 --> 00:53:05.840
So this is translating to minus
1/2 d dx, then square root g,

00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.650
gzz.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:09.240
Only the z direction matters.

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:13.442
Then partial z phi times pi c.

00:53:13.442 --> 00:53:14.900
Then z equal to 0
and the infinity.

00:53:20.950 --> 00:53:24.160
So now you recognize
this guy is precisely

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:31.640
our pi with some minus
signs-- precisely our pi.

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:38.515
So this can also be
written as 1/2 d dx pi

00:53:38.515 --> 00:53:44.500
c and the phi c you write it as
a 0, infinity-- is equal to 0,

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:48.260
is equal to infinity.

00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:50.630
So sometimes, we also
write it in momentum space,

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.900
which is convenient
because we can solve it

00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:54.490
in the momentum space.

00:53:54.490 --> 00:54:06.330
So it can also be written as d
dk 2 pi d phi c kz and the pi

00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:11.775
c minus k, z, then 0, infinity.

00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:37.830
So we have now reduced it to
evaluate this on-shell action

00:54:37.830 --> 00:54:41.860
to just two boundary terms at
z equal to infinity and z equal

00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:45.750
to 0, OK?

00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:59.590
So now, we will later see
that at infinity, with pi

00:54:59.590 --> 00:55:05.270
c times phi c at z equal to
infinity just equal to 0, OK.

00:55:05.270 --> 00:55:13.106
We will see, OK?

00:55:16.610 --> 00:55:20.260
So we will see explicitly that
in the right solution, that

00:55:20.260 --> 00:55:23.080
both pi c and the
phi c, they go to 0.

00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:26.060
But actually, there's
also a simple way

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:32.570
to argue without looking
at the [INAUDIBLE] solution

00:55:32.570 --> 00:55:34.170
that this is actually
generically also

00:55:34.170 --> 00:55:36.265
0 for the following reason.

00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:44.850
It's that at
infinity, of course,

00:55:44.850 --> 00:55:47.750
we want the full solution
to be well-defined.

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.550
So we should also require
phi c or partial z

00:55:54.550 --> 00:56:04.300
phi c to be finite, OK?

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.970
We don't want them to diverge.

00:56:05.970 --> 00:56:09.380
Then you have a
singular solution, OK?

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:12.970
So we want them to be finite.

00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:14.030
And now you see the pi.

00:56:16.620 --> 00:56:20.620
The pi-- you work out
the fact of the pi when

00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:28.220
the z goes to infinity is
proportional to 1 minus d

00:56:28.220 --> 00:56:31.301
partial z phi, OK?

00:56:34.530 --> 00:56:37.740
Because of the square
root g-- square root

00:56:37.740 --> 00:56:40.370
g there take the determinant.

00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:45.340
It's 1 over z to the
power d, d plus 1.

00:56:45.340 --> 00:56:48.310
And the gzz inverse
is the z square.

00:56:48.310 --> 00:56:50.822
So you get this power, OK?

00:56:50.822 --> 00:56:52.140
You get this power.

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:55.160
So this-- we generically
go to 0 for z

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:59.210
goes to infinity when d
is greater than 1, OK?

00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:01.140
So for any dimension
greater than 1,

00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.310
if we impose this kind
of regularity condition,

00:57:03.310 --> 00:57:05.830
then this is always 0.

00:57:05.830 --> 00:57:08.380
But in fact, for this case,
if you solve those equations

00:57:08.380 --> 00:57:11.020
explicitly, you find actually
even for d equal to 1,

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:14.334
this goes to 0, OK?

00:57:14.334 --> 00:57:15.750
So this is actually
generically 0.

00:57:15.750 --> 00:57:17.291
So we don't need to
worry about them.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.720
So now let's just focus
on the z equal to 0 side.

00:57:28.370 --> 00:57:30.760
Now let's focus on
z equal to 0 side.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:48.090
OK, so we have this
condition for phi

00:57:48.090 --> 00:57:51.310
which we derived last time.

00:57:51.310 --> 00:57:56.840
It says phi c should satisfy
some Ax z to the power

00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:01.779
d minus delta plus some
Bx, the leading term.

00:58:01.779 --> 00:58:03.695
You know, because there
are sub leading terms,

00:58:03.695 --> 00:58:04.653
this is a leading term.

00:58:08.030 --> 00:58:12.660
And so from that expression,
you can also obtain the pi c

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:17.410
from that expression-- pi c.

00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:19.800
And then you can
easily work out.

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:27.300
And that's proportional
to, say, minus A d minus

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:31.350
delta, z to the minus
delta minus delta

00:58:31.350 --> 00:58:36.071
B z delta minus d, OK?

00:58:36.071 --> 00:58:40.780
So you just take the
derivative, and you find that.

00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:43.950
So just intuitively,
you have the same thing,

00:58:43.950 --> 00:58:48.630
this z minus d
factor multiplying

00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:50.550
the derivative of phi.

00:58:50.550 --> 00:58:53.800
So intuitively, now
we go to z equal to 0.

00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:55.330
Then this factor
actually is bad.

00:58:55.330 --> 00:58:58.300
Because this factor
goes to infinity, OK?

00:58:58.300 --> 00:58:59.884
This factor goes to infinity.

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:09.010
So you see that the pi
c indeed is generically

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:12.100
divergent because
of this term, OK?

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.356
Generically divergent
because of this term.

00:59:14.356 --> 00:59:16.230
So now let's look at
the product between them

00:59:16.230 --> 00:59:19.400
because this involves
the product between them.

00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:26.900
So the leading term product
between them, phi c pi c,

00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:34.730
is proportional to z to the
power of d minus 2 delta, OK?

00:59:37.410 --> 00:59:39.270
So this is all the
expression for the delta.

00:59:42.850 --> 00:59:47.124
And nu is always greater
than or equal to 0.

00:59:47.124 --> 00:59:49.040
So we see that this term
was always divergent.

00:59:55.540 --> 01:00:02.680
It's always divergent
for nu greater than 0.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:13.644
And for nu equal
to 0, it actually

01:00:13.644 --> 01:00:15.310
requires a little bit
special treatment.

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:20.890
Because for nu equal to 0, then
delta equal to d divided by 2.

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:23.280
Then these two terms
have the same power, then

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:25.676
become degenerated in
this logarithm term.

01:00:25.676 --> 01:00:27.050
And again, it will
be divergence.

01:00:27.050 --> 01:00:30.620
But I will not go into that, OK?

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:34.259
So the story is that
this is always divergent.

01:00:34.259 --> 01:00:35.300
This is always divergent.

01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.050
So this will confirm
what we said earlier.

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:50.150
So this tells you that
SE phi c is divergent.

01:01:02.630 --> 01:01:05.980
So we need to renormalize it.

01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:08.480
We need to renormalize it.

01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:12.650
So we need to add the
counterterm to it, OK?

01:01:12.650 --> 01:01:16.350
We need to add the
counterterm to it.

01:01:16.350 --> 01:01:21.440
So the choice of the
counterterm, as we said before,

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.050
should be local
on the covariant.

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:32.670
So here, it's very simple.

01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:34.730
We only work out
the quadratic order.

01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:37.650
We only need to write down
things quadratic in phi.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:40.180
So the counterterm should
also be quadratic in phi.

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:48.710
So we can write counterterm
as the following.

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:54.190
So it's easier to write in
the momentum space, say,

01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:56.065
evaluated at this epsilon.

01:01:56.065 --> 01:02:00.530
So we need to introduce our
cut-off equal to epsilon

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:03.220
and then introduce
a counterterm.

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:06.320
So the counterterm
introduced should be local.

01:02:09.810 --> 01:02:12.640
So the local term-- so
at a quadratic level,

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:16.420
all possible local terms
can be written as follows.

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:19.330
We can write it in momentum
space as the following.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.740
Say, as something which
is a function of k

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:38.250
squared-- phi c, k, say,
z phi c minus k, z, OK?

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:40.390
So the criterion is said fk.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:52.315
So the locality means that fk
must be analytic in k square.

01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:02.440
So let me just give
you some intuition.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.760
So this is a compact expression
using momentum space.

01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:09.050
But in coordinate space,
it's easy to understand.

01:03:09.050 --> 01:03:10.503
So this is analytic
in k squared.

01:03:10.503 --> 01:03:12.510
So you expand it in k square.

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:16.340
So k square is this Lorentz
covariant k square--

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.490
using this Lorenz
covariant k squared.

01:03:23.570 --> 01:03:27.460
Yeah, the same k square is here,
which is a Lorentz covariant k

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.520
square.

01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:33.000
So you can expand
this in k square.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.652
So the 0-th order
term just a constant.

01:03:35.652 --> 01:03:38.110
And the constant, when you go
back to the coordinate space,

01:03:38.110 --> 01:03:40.050
this is just phi square, OK?

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:40.720
This is simple.

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.470
It's a local term.

01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:44.270
You can write in
terms of two phis.

01:03:44.270 --> 01:03:47.130
And the next order
term will be k square.

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:49.460
k square, when you go
back to coordinate space,

01:03:49.460 --> 01:03:52.770
this will be just partial
phi square and et cetera.

01:03:52.770 --> 01:03:55.890
And indeed, these are the only
local terms you can write down.

01:03:55.890 --> 01:04:00.870
And so essentially, you can
summarize in the momentum space

01:04:00.870 --> 01:04:05.550
just as something which is
analytic in k square, OK?

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:10.100
So now, we want to
choose the k square

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:12.810
to cancel the divergence, OK?

01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:15.020
So want to chose the
case-- I chose this

01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:16.724
to cancel the divergence, OK?

01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:45.600
So now, in order
to do a-- so now I

01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:49.310
need to introduce a
little bit of notation.

01:04:49.310 --> 01:04:53.640
Because if we want to worry
about the locality-- and it's

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:58.570
not enough just to look
at this leading term, OK?

01:04:58.570 --> 01:05:00.900
Look at leading
term-- so remember,

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:08.080
those things-- so those behavior
obtained solving this equation

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.960
by setting this to be 0.

01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.590
So when z goes to 0
limit to leading order,

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:15.740
the kz just goes to 0
compared to this term.

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:18.700
So that expression,
which we did last time,

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:22.290
are obtained by
solving this equation

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:24.610
without this kz squared term.

01:05:24.610 --> 01:05:27.460
So we include this
kz squared term

01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.482
so that we include some
higher order corrections, OK?

01:05:30.482 --> 01:05:32.190
We include some higher
order corrections.

01:05:32.190 --> 01:05:35.712
But now since we worry about
whether this fk squared

01:05:35.712 --> 01:05:38.170
is analytic-- so we have to
worry about those k dependence.

01:05:43.270 --> 01:05:48.750
OK, so now let me introduce
some notation, OK?

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:57.710
So let's consider the
basis of solution--

01:05:57.710 --> 01:06:05.520
the basis of solutions
to this equation, phi 1,

01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:10.260
which I call phi 1, and phi 2.

01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:12.690
So phi 1 and phi 2 precisely
are defined by these two

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:15.530
asymptotic behavior.

01:06:15.530 --> 01:06:20.580
So phi 1 has the behavior
that goes to d minus delta.

01:06:20.580 --> 01:06:22.470
And the phi 2 then
have the behavior

01:06:22.470 --> 01:06:25.690
when you go to z equal to 0,
it goes to z to the power delta

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.520
as z goes to 0, OK?

01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:33.580
So this is the
leading term for phi.

01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:42.710
But for small z, this can be
written as a power series.

01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:46.370
And then the leading term
will be just like that.

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:50.570
Then you will have,
say, some a1 k

01:06:50.570 --> 01:06:55.980
squared z square term come from
treating the next order list

01:06:55.980 --> 01:07:04.530
term and also higher order
terms-- say, k4, z4, et cetera.

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:11.680
So similarly, phi 2 z,
k would be start with z

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:13.660
to the power of delta.

01:07:13.660 --> 01:07:15.480
Then will be also have
higher order terms.

01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:22.350
OK?

01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:26.040
So the key is that you can work
out those coefficients, OK?

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.820
Because this is local
expansion of infinity,

01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:33.160
and you can work out those
coefficients explicitly.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:36.910
And all the dependents on
k are local in the sense

01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:40.220
that they all are
dependant only on k square.

01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:42.800
It's because the k square
is what k square appears

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:44.900
in the original equations, OK?

01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:50.780
And similarly, you
can work out the pi.

01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:56.200
So the corresponding
pi 1 and the pi 2

01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:01.095
corresponding canonical momentum
for them equal pi 1, pi 2, OK?

01:08:01.095 --> 01:08:03.500
Then the pi 1, pi
2, each of them

01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:05.680
will have these
two behaviors, OK?

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:07.560
Each of them will have
these two behaviors

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.984
and along with these
higher order terms, OK?

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:19.660
Good?

01:08:23.359 --> 01:08:44.420
So now-- so now let's look
at this on-shell action.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:51.779
So this on-shell action, before
we regularize it, evaluate it

01:08:51.779 --> 01:08:54.770
at z equal to epsilon.

01:08:54.770 --> 01:09:02.370
So this would be-- oh right,
there's one more step.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:04.160
Sorry.

01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:05.920
So using this
notation, we can just

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:16.550
write our phi c equal to A phi
1 plus Bk same momentum case--

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:17.819
phi 2.

01:09:17.819 --> 01:09:22.729
So now these are exact
expression because the phi 1,

01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:25.479
phi 2 are two
bases and Ak and AB

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:27.609
are just linear coefficients
of that basis, OK?

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:34.434
And the pi c would
be similarly Ak,

01:09:34.434 --> 01:09:40.882
where pi 1 plus Bk pi 2, OK?

01:09:50.850 --> 01:10:09.880
So under the SE phi c would
be, if you plug this in,

01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:17.770
just have A square pi 1
and phi 1 plus B square pi

01:10:17.770 --> 01:10:34.420
2 phi 2 plus AB pi 1 phi
2 plus phi 1 pi 2, OK?

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:44.689
And this is the one
that's divergent.

01:10:44.689 --> 01:10:46.230
So this is the one
which is divergent

01:10:46.230 --> 01:10:50.890
coming from the
expression we said before.

01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:52.610
OK, this is divergent.

01:10:52.610 --> 01:10:56.814
And so this is phi
1, this is pi 1, OK?

01:10:56.814 --> 01:10:57.750
So this is divergent.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.360
And the other term you can
all check are finite, OK?

01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:08.670
So this is divergent.

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:10.155
So we need to cancel this term.

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:17.010
But you cannot just
abstract this term.

01:11:17.010 --> 01:11:20.040
You cannot just abstract this
term because this term is not

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.860
covariant.

01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:25.220
Because A-- because this
term is not covariant.

01:11:25.220 --> 01:11:28.970
This term does not have the
form of the phi square et

01:11:28.970 --> 01:11:33.690
cetera, does not have
this covariant form, OK?

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.580
So this term by itself
is not covariant.

01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.891
So you cannot just
subtract this term.

01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:49.680
But now, you can easily-- so
now, we have phi square here.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.460
So now you can easily pick a phi
just to cancel this term, OK?

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.340
Just by comparing
these two, we can just

01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:59.740
pick an f to cancel that term.

01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:19.940
So it turns out that f can be
written as pi 1 phi 1 times

01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:21.722
phi square, OK?

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.300
So essentially, this is our f.

01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:31.284
It's the ratio between
pi 1 and phi 1.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:38.710
So now if you expand it,
since I'm out of time-- so

01:12:38.710 --> 01:12:40.400
let me not do it here.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.340
If you expand it, you
can easily see this term

01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:47.790
cancels that term, OK?

01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:49.670
But there are other
terms from the covariant.

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:53.430
So there are also finite
terms brought by this term.

01:12:53.430 --> 01:12:57.450
But there's also finite
terms brought by this term.

01:12:57.450 --> 01:13:03.200
And this is local because this
is a ratio of pi 1 and phi 1.

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:08.410
And both pi 1 and
phi 1 are obtained

01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:13.600
by solving this equation
locally at the infinity

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.900
just by power series and
dependence on k squared.

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:19.380
It's always analytic, OK?

01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.270
So this is guaranteed.

01:13:21.270 --> 01:13:23.497
So this is analytic
function of k squared.

01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:32.630
OK, so you take a
little bit of exercise.

01:13:32.630 --> 01:13:38.087
You work out what is a
here, a1 here, et cetera.

01:13:38.087 --> 01:13:39.920
Then you can write this
term more explicitly

01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:43.130
in terms of standard term
like phi square, partial phi

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:44.570
square, et cetera, OK?

01:13:47.350 --> 01:13:50.869
So now you add
these two together.

01:13:50.869 --> 01:13:52.285
So now you add
these two together.

01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:07.010
You get a renormalized
counterterm, OK?

01:14:07.010 --> 01:14:08.760
Then you find the
renormalized expression.

01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:23.810
Then you find the
renormalized expression

01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:30.940
is SR phi c is
given by 1/2, again

01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:40.180
in momentum space,
2 nu A, minus k, Bk.

01:14:48.140 --> 01:14:51.770
So you find everything
depends on phi 1, pi.

01:14:51.770 --> 01:14:53.300
They all disappear in the end.

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:55.150
You just get
something like this.

01:14:55.150 --> 01:14:58.910
You get a finite term like this.

01:14:58.910 --> 01:15:00.760
So now this is ambiguous.

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.020
It's all finite and ambiguous.

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.589
So this is your on-shell action.

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:12.880
So normally, what we do is
that we solve this equation.

01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:20.020
Then we can find the
explicit A and B.

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:22.850
So we solve this equation
with the following boundary

01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:24.177
conditions.

01:15:24.177 --> 01:15:26.135
It said we first impose
the boundary condition.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:35.630
You have Ak equal to phi
k because A is the source.

01:15:35.630 --> 01:15:38.940
A is identified with the source.

01:15:38.940 --> 01:15:47.610
But we also need to
impose regularity

01:15:47.610 --> 01:15:50.340
at z equal to infinity.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:53.650
So we wanted the solution
to be well-defined

01:15:53.650 --> 01:15:56.210
at z equal to infinity.

01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:59.230
So it turns out these are the
two conditions which uniquely

01:15:59.230 --> 01:16:00.959
determine the solution.

01:16:00.959 --> 01:16:02.750
So that means these
two conditions together

01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:09.680
which will determine
B in terms of A. OK,

01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:13.350
so this will determine
B in terms of A.

01:16:13.350 --> 01:16:19.540
So in particular, this
is a linear solution.

01:16:19.540 --> 01:16:24.939
So B will have the form which--
some number chi times A. So chi

01:16:24.939 --> 01:16:26.730
is the thing which you
determine by solving

01:16:26.730 --> 01:16:29.950
the equation explicitly, OK?

01:16:29.950 --> 01:16:36.492
This is a form-- chi you obtain
from solving the equation.

01:16:44.110 --> 01:16:45.595
Just short a couple minutes.

01:16:45.595 --> 01:16:50.811
It's just-- so now you
plug this into that.

01:16:50.811 --> 01:16:51.810
You plug this into that.

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:01.610
Plug this into that.

01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:06.470
Unfortunately, I
erased my equation.

01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:12.090
OK, so you plug this into that.

01:17:12.090 --> 01:17:15.550
So chi you assume is
some known function

01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:17.770
which you obtain
after you are solving

01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:21.000
the equation explicitly.

01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.620
Then what you get--
so without that page.

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:33.110
So what you get is you will
get S renormalized action phi

01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:36.610
c equal to 1/2 the integration.

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:42.485
So 2 nu Ak-- 2 nu
lambda-- or we here

01:17:42.485 --> 01:17:49.040
call chi-- Ak and
A, minus k, OK?

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.860
So you remember this
is just all phi k.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:55.150
This is just all phi k.

01:17:55.150 --> 01:17:58.710
So now you can obtain
the one-point function.

01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:04.610
Just take the derivative
over phi-- say, minus k.

01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:05.820
You get the Ok.

01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:15.470
And this is precisely
just 2 nu chi times Ak.

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:19.677
And this is
precisely 2 nu B, OK?

01:18:19.677 --> 01:18:21.510
And you can write it
in the coordinate space

01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:27.310
also, Ox equal to 2 nu B.

01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:29.630
So this we derive
in the linear order

01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:32.120
by looking at the
quadratic equation motions.

01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.420
But actually, this turns out
you can prove it actually

01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:35.550
to all order.

01:18:35.550 --> 01:18:37.965
You work with nonlinear
equations, et cetera,

01:18:37.965 --> 01:18:41.460
you can show this is always true
that the one-point function is

01:18:41.460 --> 01:18:43.510
always given by this B, OK?

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:46.844
One-point function is
always given by this B.

01:18:46.844 --> 01:18:49.196
So let me say one thing.

01:18:49.196 --> 01:18:58.470
So now the two-point function--
so the two-point function, you

01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:59.690
just take two derivatives.

01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:07.670
You take two derivatives.

01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:14.240
So that just gives
you 2 nu chi, OK?

01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:17.002
Just the 2 nu chi.

01:19:17.002 --> 01:19:20.370
So this can also be
written as 2 nu B divided

01:19:20.370 --> 01:19:28.140
by A because the
chi is equal to--

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:29.940
and this makes perfect
sense physically

01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:35.910
because this is our Euclidean
correlation function, OK?

01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:38.110
And the 2 nu divided
by A can also

01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:40.640
be written using
what we write there.

01:19:40.640 --> 01:19:44.110
So this is the
expectation value divided

01:19:44.110 --> 01:19:47.700
by phi k divided by the
source, so A because it's phi

01:19:47.700 --> 01:19:50.190
and 2 nu B is expectation value.

01:19:50.190 --> 01:19:52.620
And then we see this
expression is precisely

01:19:52.620 --> 01:19:55.170
a so-called linear response.

01:19:55.170 --> 01:19:58.250
The expectation value in
the presence of the source

01:19:58.250 --> 01:20:05.186
is the correlation
function times the source--

01:20:05.186 --> 01:20:07.440
the correlation
times the source.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.840
So again, this equation
is completely general.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:11.610
So for any two-point
function case,

01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:15.130
we'll always find this B
divided by A times 2 nu.

01:20:15.130 --> 01:20:19.270
And you can also
alternatively written it

01:20:19.270 --> 01:20:25.430
as the ratio O
divided by phi, OK?

01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:26.565
So just the final minute.

01:20:29.136 --> 01:20:30.886
Now you can solve the
equation explicitly.

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:38.660
So now you can solve
the equation explicitly.

01:20:38.660 --> 01:20:41.380
You can solve the
equation explicitly.

01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:46.598
And you can solve your [? eom ?]
using the Bessel function.

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:54.810
And then you find that
actually, the function which

01:20:54.810 --> 01:20:58.860
is no [INAUDIBLE] the infinity
at z equal to infinity

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:01.590
is given by this form.

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:07.330
k-- so this Bessel k
function with index nu.

01:21:07.330 --> 01:21:08.900
Nu is the same as this nu.

01:21:12.540 --> 01:21:15.510
And then from here, you
just expand in small z.

01:21:15.510 --> 01:21:18.590
Then you can find
the B divided by A.

01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:22.940
Then you find B divided by A
as gamma, minus nu, gamma nu.

01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:25.650
So from here, you just
expand in small z.

01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:27.320
And then you extract
different power.

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:30.740
You obtain the ratio
of B divided by A, OK?

01:21:30.740 --> 01:21:34.290
So as you get gamma
nu-- minus nu,

01:21:34.290 --> 01:21:39.670
gamma nu k divided by
2 to the power 2 nu.

01:21:43.890 --> 01:21:45.680
So you find the
two-point function.

01:21:50.160 --> 01:21:53.330
So since the two-point
function is just the 2 nu B,

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:56.400
A-- so you find the
Euclidean two-point function

01:21:56.400 --> 01:21:58.890
in momentum space.

01:21:58.890 --> 01:22:04.600
It's just 2 nu gamma,
minus nu, gamma nu,

01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:08.860
k divided by 2 to the 2 nu.

01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:11.330
So in some sense,
this is precisely what

01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:12.940
you expect because
we are working

01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:15.830
with the conformal field theory.

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:19.320
And the two-point function can
only depend on k as a power

01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.400
because there's no other scale.

01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.560
There's no other scale.

01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:25.800
And the power is determined by
the dimension of the operator.

01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:30.080
And for example, if you go
to the coordinate space--

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:32.370
so you Fourier transform,
go to coordinate space.

01:22:32.370 --> 01:22:35.842
So that just gives you the
X to the power 2 delta.

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:43.240
Sorry-- I will stop here.

00:00:04.392 --> 00:00:06.070
PROFESSOR: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:07.560
Welcome back.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.100
So today we'd like to tackle
a problem in Fourier series.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.610
And specifically, we're just
going to compute the Fourier

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.510
series for a simple function.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.670
So the function we're interested
in is f of t, which we're told

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.290
is periodic with period 2pi--
f of t is 1 from minus pi to 0,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:32.880
and then it's minus
1 from 0 to pi.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.160
So first off, we're interested
in sketching f of t.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.890
Secondly, we'd like to compute
the Fourier series for f of t.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.980
And then thirdly, we'd like to
sketch the first non-zero term

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.640
of the Fourier series.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.590
And we can specifically
sketch this single term

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.299
on top of f of t.

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.340
So I'll let you think
about this problem for now,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.548
and I'll be back in a moment.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.900
Hi, everyone.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.632
Welcome back.

00:01:11.632 --> 00:01:13.340
So let's take a look
at sketching f of t.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.560
So for part a, we
have our axes, t.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.500
And we're told f of t
within some interval.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.280
So we might as well plot
f of t on that interval.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:42.910
So minus pi, pi and
0, we know that f of t

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:49.820
is 1 from minus pi to 0.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.080
We're also told that it's
minus 1 from 0 to pi.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.780
And now to fill in the blanks
or to complete the picture of f,

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.125
we're told that it
has a period of 2pi.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:07.500
So note that
they've told us what

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.020
f looks like over
the range of minus pi

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.560
to pi, which is
the length of 2pi.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.110
So basically what we can do
is we can use this as a stamp

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.160
and just pick up
this entire picture,

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.040
shift it over one
period 2pi, and just

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.690
thinking of this picture in
stamping it in multiple places.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:37.150
So just filling
this in it's going

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:46.530
to look like a square wave,
which jumps between minus 1

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.640
and 1 at every multiple of pi.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.890
So this concludes part a.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.780
For part b, which is the
real meat of the problem,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.010
we're interested in computing
a Fourier series for f of t.

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.950
Now, we can always write
down a Fourier series

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.530
for any periodic function.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.890
And specifically in
this case, for part b,

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.810
the periodic function we're
interested in has period 2pi.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.240
So for the class
notes, we've identified

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.230
L with half the period.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.360
So in this case,
L is 2pi divided

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.190
by 2, which gives us pi.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.200
And just to recall what a
Fourier series is, what we do

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.100
is we try and take
our function f of t

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.730
and write it down as a
summation of sines and cosines.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.565
So in this case for function
f of t, which is 2pi periodic,

00:03:45.565 --> 00:03:47.190
it's going to look
something like this.

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:54.155
It's going to a of 0 plus
sum from n equals 1--

00:03:54.155 --> 00:03:56.430
and there's going to be
infinitely many terms,

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.130
but in this case we have a
of n times cosine of n*t.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.280
And it's n*t here because
we have period 2pi.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.635
Plus b_n sine n_t.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.589
So this is the general form.

00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:20.269
And when asked to compute the
Fourier series of a function,

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.240
the main difficulty is to
compute these coefficients a_n

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.320
and b_n.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.400
However, that
essentially boils down

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.740
to working out some integrals.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:37.120
So let's take a look
at what a of 0 is.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.380
So the formula for a_0 is 1
over 2L-- so in this case,

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.310
it's 1 over 2pi--
times the integral

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.785
over 1 period of the
function, from minus pi to pi,

00:04:52.785 --> 00:04:53.410
of just f of t.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.100
So notice how a_0 is just
the average of the function.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.400
So if we take a look at
the function f of t, f of t

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.370
spends exactly half of its
time at 1 and half of its time

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:08.570
at minus 1.

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.730
So immediately we could
guess that the average value

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:13.170
of f of t is going to be 0.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:21.310
If you wanted to work
it out specifically,

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.700
we would have 1 over 2pi
minus pi to 0, f of t

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.180
takes on the value of plus 1.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.900
And then from 0 to pi, f of t
takes on the value of minus 1.

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.380
So we would end up getting
pi minus pi, which is 0.

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:56.810
For a_n, the formula is
1 over half the period.

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.320
So note how a of 0 is
just a special case.

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.980
We always have the full period
in a_0, but in a_n and b_n,

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.550
the factor that divides the
integral is always going to be

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:23.090
half the period times minus pi
to pi, f of t cosine n*t dt.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.790
And I should point out
that, in general, we only

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:28.520
need to integrate over one
period of the function.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.860
So in some sense there's nothing
special about minus pi and pi.

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.310
It's just very often
these are the easiest

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.790
bounds of integration
to integrate over.

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:43.220
But in practice, we
could have used 0

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.265
to 2pi or any other interval,
as long as it's exactly

00:06:47.265 --> 00:06:48.390
one period of the function.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:55.080
So in this case, I'd
just like to take a look

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.320
at the symmetry of f of t.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.580
And we note that
the function f of t

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.410
is actually odd
about the origin.

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:08.890
So if f of t is odd and cosine
t is an even function, then

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.420
an odd times an even function
is going to be an odd function.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.650
And when you integrate an odd
function from minus any value

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.520
to the same positive value, so
in this case minus pi to pi,

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.810
we always get 0.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.450
So this is actually
0, because we're

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:31.030
integrating an odd function
over a symmetric interval.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:48.730
So lastly, we have the values
of b_n, which are 1 over pi,

00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:59.200
minus pi to pi, f
of t of sine n*t dt.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.140
And if we were to look at just
the symmetry argument again,

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.590
f of t is an odd
function, sine t

00:08:04.590 --> 00:08:07.330
is an odd function, an odd
times an odd function is

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:08.560
an even function.

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.360
When you integrate
an even function

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:13.770
over a symmetric bound,
you will essentially

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:15.340
get twice the value
of the integral

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.200
from 0 to one of the bounds.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:20.155
So b of n in this
case doesn't vanish,

00:08:20.155 --> 00:08:22.030
which means we actually
have to do some work.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.020
So what we do?

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.860
Well, we know the value of
f of t on two intervals,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:34.909
so we're just going to have
to work out each interval.

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.330
Minus pi to 0, it takes
on the value of 1.

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:39.480
So we have sine n*t.

00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:51.790
And then from 0 to pi, f of t
takes on the value of minus 1,

00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:57.459
sine n*t dt.

00:08:57.459 --> 00:08:59.500
And you'll note that these
integrals are actually

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.000
the same.

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:15.730
So this is negative 2 over
pi, zero to pi, sine n*t dt,

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:26.470
which if we integrate is
negative 1 over n cosine n*t

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:28.130
evaluated between 0 and pi.

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:41.040
So if I work this out,
we get minus and a minus,

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:51.360
minus 1 over n cosine
n*pi plus 1 over n.

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:53.170
So note that cosine
of 0 is just 1.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:59.310
And now if we take a
look at cosine n*pi,

00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:01.660
we see that cosine n*pi
oscillates between minus 1

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:02.600
and 1.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.070
So cosine of pi is negative
1, cosine of 2pi is 1,

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.365
cosine of 3pi is minus 1.

00:10:07.365 --> 00:10:09.180
Dot, dot, dot.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.160
So this term right here is
actually negative 1 to the n.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:26.861
So we have 2 over n*pi 1
minus negative 1 to the n.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.320
And now if we just plug in
some values of b of 1, b of 2,

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:43.520
b of 3, b of 4, we can see what
pattern emerges in the b's.

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.930
So b of 1, if I plug in 1,
I get 1 minus negative 1.

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:51.570
It's going to be 2.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:56.490
So I get minus 4 over pi.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:04.252
b of 2 is going to be 1 minus
minus 1 squared is just 1.

00:11:04.252 --> 00:11:04.960
So this vanishes.

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:11.980
b of 3 is going to
be 1 minus minus 1

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.360
cubed, which is negative 1.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.460
So again, we get
negative 4 over 3pi.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.650
b of 4 is going to be 0.

00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:32.470
So it's sometimes
useful the write out

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:34.890
what the Fourier
series looks like.

00:11:34.890 --> 00:11:39.040
So I'll just write
it out right here.

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:47.710
So we have f of t is going to
be negative 4 over pi times

00:11:47.710 --> 00:12:02.815
sine of t plus 1/3 sine of 3t
plus 1/5 sine of 5t plus dot,

00:12:02.815 --> 00:12:03.320
dot, dot.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:15.050
So this concludes part b.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.710
And now lastly,
for part c, we're

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:22.270
asked to sketch what does the
first Fourier term look like.

00:12:22.270 --> 00:12:24.540
So in this case, the
first Fourier term

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:30.350
is going to be negative
4 over pi times sine t.

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.520
So I'm going to go back to
our diagram from part a.

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.180
So let's go back to our
diagram from part a.

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:40.530
Now what is minus 4 over
pi sine t look like?

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:45.730
Well, it's a sine wave that
has exactly period 2pi,

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:50.130
and it's going to line up
exactly with this square wave.

00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:55.740
In addition, minus 4 over pi
is just slightly larger than 1.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.230
So we're going to
end up with sin,

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:03.560
which peaks just slightly
above 1 and slightly below 1.

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:05.610
It's going to go
through 0, and it's

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:11.859
going to go through
each multiple of pi.

00:13:11.859 --> 00:13:13.400
So it might look
something like this.

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:36.285
So this is the first
Fourier term in the series.

00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:43.000
And notice how this first
Fourier term is actually

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.290
pretty good approximation to the
square wave, considering it's

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:48.860
just one term in a series.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.610
As we add more
terms in the series,

00:13:51.610 --> 00:13:54.370
we're going to get something
which looks closer and closer

00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:55.650
to a square wave function.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.740
So I'd just like
to quickly recap.

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:04.380
When computing the Fourier
series for a periodic function,

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.410
the first useful thing
to do is just write down

00:14:06.410 --> 00:14:08.922
the formula for
a Fourier series,

00:14:08.922 --> 00:14:11.130
and then write down the
formulas for the coefficients

00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:12.046
of the Fourier series.

00:14:12.046 --> 00:14:16.260
So write down the formulas
for a_0, a_n, b_n.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:18.110
When computing a_0,
you can often just

00:14:18.110 --> 00:14:20.740
look at the average
of the function.

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.290
When computing a_n and
b_n, it's also useful

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.910
look at the symmetry
of your function.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.830
And if it's either
even or odd symmetric

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.940
then typically, either all the
a_n's or all the b_n's will

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.380
vanish.

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.550
And then when you work
out the integrals,

00:14:34.550 --> 00:14:37.700
you can then reconstruct
the Fourier series.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.200
So I would like
to conclude here,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:41.356
and I'll see you next time.

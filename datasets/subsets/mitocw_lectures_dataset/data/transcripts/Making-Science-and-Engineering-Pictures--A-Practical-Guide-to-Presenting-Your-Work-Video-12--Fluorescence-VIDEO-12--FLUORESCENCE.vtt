00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.670
Here's a brief look at imaging
with fluorescing material.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.910
The wonderful thing
about our photography

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.570
is that we can image at
very long shutter speeds.

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.710
This particular image
was taken at four seconds

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.980
and I was on a tripod.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.420
So, we can do that when we
have the right equipment.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.260
You're looking at
a series of vials

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.100
that contain nano crystals,
and I am exciting it

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.770
with ultraviolet lamps.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.420
Here is another image
that I'm not crazy about.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.580
That's the image
that the researchers

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.890
would have preferred.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.010
I then went back
and started playing

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.010
with the cuvettes with all these
cadmium selenide nanocrystals.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.200
I placed it in
this order and then

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.850
I made it a little more random.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.480
You're not gonna do
this all the time,

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.800
but happens that this particular
material was screaming

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.530
to be played with, and, it
was really important research

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.850
about quantum dots.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.440
In these next two
images, here's one

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.780
that was taken under UV
light because these gels

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.770
in the petri dishes
are also fluorescent

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.500
(different wavelengths, of
course, from the previous one.)

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.110
And here it is with fluorescing,
with UV light, and, room light.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.430
I had a combination
of both on these.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.370
And here's another example
of those quantum dots.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.340
This time they were
infused into plastic.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.860
Here is a purely UV
illuminated image,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.500
and, once again, I decided to
turn on some available light,

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.850
and it's like a sort
of a combination

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.960
of using the UV lamp
and available lamp

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.250
light in the lab.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.690
MICHAEL SHORT: So I want
to do a quick review

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.773
of what we did last time,
because I know I threw--

00:00:26.773 --> 00:00:29.550
I think we threw the full six
boards of math and physics

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.600
at you guys.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.240
We started off
trying to describe

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.830
this general situation.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.870
If you have a small nucleus 1
firing at a large nucleus 2,

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.380
something happens, and we
didn't specify what that was.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.690
A potentially
different nucleus 3

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.080
could come shooting
off at angle theta,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.690
and a potentially different
nucleus 4 goes off

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.113
at a different angle phi.

00:00:53.113 --> 00:00:55.530
Just to warn you guys, before
you start copying everything

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.080
from the board,
starting last week

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.730
I've been taking pictures of
the board at the end of class.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.960
So if you prefer to look and
listen or just take a few notes

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.700
rather than copy
everything else down,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.033
I'll be taking pictures of
the board at the end of class

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:10.200
from now on and posting
them to the Stellar site.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.302
So up to you how
you want to do it.

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:14.010
We started off with
just three equations.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.710
We conserve mass,
energy, and momentum.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.320
Mass and energy-- let's see--

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.270
come from the same equation.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:28.320
c squared plus T1 plus
M2 c squared plus T2

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:37.260
has to equal M3 c squared plus
T3 plus M4 c squared plus T4.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:40.230
We started off making
one quick assumption,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.260
that the nucleus 2, whatever
we're firing things at,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.670
has no kinetic energy.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.115
So we can just forget that.

00:01:47.115 --> 00:01:48.810
What we also said
is that we have

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.660
to conserve x and y momentum.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:54.600
So if we say the x
momentum of particle 1

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.930
would be root 2 M1 T1
plus 0 for particle 2,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.650
because if particle 2 is not
moving, it has no momentum.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.090
Has to equal root 2
M3 T3 cosine theta,

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.480
because it's the x
component of the momentum,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.740
plus root 2 M4 T4 cosine phi.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.880
And the last equation
for y momentum--

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:29.940
we'll call this x momentum,
call that mass and energy,

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.360
call this y momentum--

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.050
was-- let's say there's no
y momentum at the beginning

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.350
of this equation.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.550
So I'll just say 0 plus 0.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.450
Equals the y component of
particle 3's momentum, root

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.230
2 M3 T3 sine theta, minus--

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.730
almost did that
wrong-- because it's

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:02.800
going in the opposite direction,
root 2 M4 T4 sine phi.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.140
We did something, and we
arrived at the Q equation.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.805
I'm trying to make sure we
get to something new today.

00:03:11.805 --> 00:03:13.430
So the Q equation
went something like--

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.110
and I want to make sure that
I don't miswrite it at all.

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.320
So when we refer
to the Q equation,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.700
we're referring to this highly
generalized equation relating

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.342
all of the quantities
that we see here.

00:03:31.342 --> 00:03:33.300
So I'm not going to go
through all of the steps

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.758
from last time,
because, again, you

00:03:34.758 --> 00:03:36.810
have a picture of the
board from last time.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:47.550
But it went Q equals T1 times M1
over M4 minus 1 plus T3 times 1

00:03:47.550 --> 00:04:01.348
plus M3 over M4 minus 2 root
M1 M3 T1 T3 cosine theta.

00:04:01.348 --> 00:04:03.640
And last time we talked about
which of these quantities

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.230
are we likely to
know ahead of time

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.480
and which ones might
we want to find out.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.460
Chances are we know all
of the masses involved

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.210
in these particles,
because, well, you guys have

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:15.790
been calculating that for the
last 2 and 1/2 weeks or so.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.920
So those would be
known quantities.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.360
We'd also know the Q value for
the reaction from conservation

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.160
of mass and energy up there.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.310
And we'd probably be controlling
the energy of particle 1

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:28.060
as it comes in.

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.920
Either we know--
if it's a neutron,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.397
we know what energy
it's born at.

00:04:31.397 --> 00:04:32.980
Or if it's coming
from an accelerator,

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.040
we crank up the voltage on the
accelerator and control that.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.010
And that leaves us
with just three quant--

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.080
two quantities that
we don't know--

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.800
the kinetic energy of
particle 3 and the angle

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.030
that it comes off at.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.580
So this was the highly,
highly generalized form.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.220
Recognize also that this is a
quadratic equation in root 3,

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.135
or root T3.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:09.180
And we did something
else, and we

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:16.140
arrived at root T3 equals
s plus or minus root s

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:21.700
squared plus t, where s and t--

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.200
let's see.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:33.980
I believe s is root M1 M3 T1
cosine theta over M3 plus M4.

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:36.510
And we'll make a
little bit more room.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.270
t should be-- damn
it, got to look.

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.770
Let's see.

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.232
I believe it's minus M4 Q plus--

00:05:46.232 --> 00:05:50.078
oh, I'll just take a quick look.

00:05:50.078 --> 00:05:51.620
All right, I have
it open right here.

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:54.141
I don't want to give you a
wrong minus sign or something.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.110
I did have a wrong minus sign.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.950
Good thing I looked.

00:06:04.175 --> 00:06:12.160
1 times E1 over M3 M4.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.870
And so we started
looking at, well,

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.960
what are the implications
of this solution right here?

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.350
For exothermic reactions,
where Q is greater than 0,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:28.710
any energy E1 gets
this reaction to occur.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.220
And all that that says, well,
it doesn't really say much.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.195
All that it really
says is that E3--

00:06:34.195 --> 00:06:40.140
I'm sorry-- T3-- and let me
make sure that I don't use any

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.420
sneaky E's in there--

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.770
plus T4 has to be greater
than the incoming energy T1.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:48.840
That's the only real
implication here,

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.780
is that some of the mass
from particles 1 and 2

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.940
turned into some kinetic
energy in particles 3 and 4.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.480
So that one's kind
of the simpler case.

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:06.120
For the endothermic case,
where Q is less than 0,

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.350
there's going to be some
threshold energy required

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.210
to overcome in order to
get this reaction to occur.

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.300
So where did we say?

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.550
So, first of all, where
would we go about deciding

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:22.575
what is the most favorable
set of conditions

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:24.200
that would allow one
of these reactions

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.448
to occur by manipulating
parameters in s and t?

00:07:27.448 --> 00:07:29.490
What's the first one that
you'd start to look at?

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:37.960
Well, let's start by
picking the angle.

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:39.610
Let's say if there
was a-- if we had

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.590
what's called
forward scattering,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.730
then this cosine
of theta equals 1.

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.850
And that probably gives
us the highest likelihood

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:52.002
of a reaction happening, or
the most energy gone into,

00:07:52.002 --> 00:07:53.710
let's say, just moving
the center of mass

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:57.025
and not the particles going
off in different directions.

00:07:57.025 --> 00:07:57.525
Let's see.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.010
Ah, so what it really
comes down to is

00:08:05.010 --> 00:08:08.670
a balance in making sure
that this term right here,

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.020
well, it can't go negative.

00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.440
If it goes negative, then
the solution is imaginary

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.630
and you don't have
anything going on.

00:08:15.630 --> 00:08:17.430
So what this implies
is that s squared

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:23.070
plus t has to be greater or
equal than 0 in order for this

00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:25.320
to occur.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:27.500
Otherwise, you would
have, like I said,

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.847
a complex solution to an energy.

00:08:29.847 --> 00:08:31.430
And energy is not
going to be complex.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.570
That means the
reaction won't occur.

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:36.760
So this is where we
got to last time.

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.260
Yes.

00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:40.890
AUDIENCE: When you say s
squared plus t is greater than 0

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:43.169
or greater than or equal
to 0, it's endothermic,

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.390
wouldn't it also be
greater than or equal to 0

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.290
for an exothermic?

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.290
MICHAEL SHORT: It would.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:48.870
But there's a
condition here that--

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:49.860
lets see.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:52.710
In this case, for
exothermic, Q is greater

00:08:52.710 --> 00:08:55.230
than 0 and that condition
is always satisfied.

00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:58.030
For an endothermic
reaction, Q is negative.

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:00.310
So that's a good point.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:06.210
So if endothermic,
then Q is less than 0,

00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:08.250
and it's all about making
sure that that sum,

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:10.720
s squared plus t,
is not negative.

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.480
What that means is in
order to balance out

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.360
the fact that you've
got a negative Q here,

00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.610
you have to increase T1 in order
to make that sum greater than

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:21.810
or equal to 0.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:22.310
Yes.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.660
AUDIENCE: So that
condition, s squared

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:25.300
plus t is greater
than or equal to 0,

00:09:25.300 --> 00:09:28.200
is that basically a condition
for the endothermic reaction

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:28.770
to occur?

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.060
MICHAEL SHORT: That's correct.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:32.910
If s squared plus t is
smaller than 0, which

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:36.660
is to say that this whole sum
right here doesn't help you

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.220
balance out the negative
Q, then the reaction

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.650
is not going to happen.

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:42.210
And something else might happen.

00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:46.110
So let's say you were looking at
a case of inelastic scattering

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:49.050
where a neutron would
get absorbed by a nucleus

00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:51.420
and be re-emitted at a
different energy level.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.300
If the energy is too
small for that to occur,

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.220
then the neutron is not
going to get absorbed.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.930
Instead it might bounce off
and undergo elastic scattering.

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.410
And as a quick
flash forward, I'll

00:10:01.410 --> 00:10:07.590
show you a quick plot of elastic
and inelastic cross-sections

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.210
that kind of hammers this home.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.550
You'll be looking at a
lot of these plots, that

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:15.030
are going to be
logarithmic in energy space

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:20.450
and probably logarithmic in
microscopic cross-section,

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.053
to bring back that
variable from before.

00:10:23.053 --> 00:10:24.470
If you remember,
the cross-section

00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:26.640
is like the probability
that a certain reaction

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.860
is going to occur.

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.080
The larger the
cross-section, the higher

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.650
the reaction rate for a
given flux of particles.

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.300
And let's say we'll split
this into two things.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:40.610
We'll call it sigma elastic
and sigma inelastic.

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.230
And we'll give them--

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:44.070
that will be-- oh,
we have colors.

00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:45.200
Let's just use those.

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.970
Even better.

00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:48.560
Where's my second color?

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.730
Under the paper.

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:51.410
Awesome.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:53.920
So let's say the elastic
cross-section is in red,

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.540
and the inelastic
cross-section is in green.

00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:03.140
And for white, we'll
plot sigma total.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.240
Usually, one of these
cross-sections for any old

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:05.842
interaction--

00:11:05.842 --> 00:11:07.550
I'm not even being
specific on which one.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:10.310
Let's just say neutrons
hitting something big--

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.050
would tend to look like this.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.750
There will be some insanity
here, that we'll discuss,

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.033
and it might start to
increase a little bit

00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:19.200
as it goes to high energies.

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:23.070
And this is definitely
not to scale.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:26.340
Just for the purposes
of illustration.

00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:28.830
The elastic cross-section
is going to look something

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:33.183
like exactly this.

00:11:33.183 --> 00:11:34.850
See how closely I can
draw on top of it.

00:11:39.660 --> 00:11:42.300
So at low energies,
when a neutron

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.270
can't be absorbed and re-emitted
at a different energy,

00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:48.690
the inelastic scattering
process can't happen.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.220
Which is to say that the
incoming kinetic energy--

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.720
so this log of E right
here, better known

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.360
as T1 in the symbols up there--

00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.562
it's not high enough to allow
inelastic scattering to occur.

00:12:00.562 --> 00:12:02.520
So if we want to graph
the inelastic scattering

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.290
cross-section, it
will typically look

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:11.570
like that, where once
you reach your threshold

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:16.390
energy, determined by
that condition there,

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.790
then the inelastic
scattering turns on

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:22.460
and it's actually
able to proceed.

00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:24.960
So this is why we're getting
into these threshold reactions,

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.840
because it helps
you understand why

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.970
do some of the
cross-sections that we study

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.980
have the shapes that they do.

00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.800
And this holds true
for pretty much

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.140
every inelastic
cross-section I've seen,

00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.940
is they all--
almost all of them,

00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:39.565
if you're starting
at the ground state,

00:12:39.565 --> 00:12:42.050
require some initial
energy input to get going.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:44.930
Whereas elastic scattering
can happen at any energy.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.570
So let's write that last
condition right here.

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:56.750
Elastic scattering,
which means things just

00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:01.490
bounce off like billiard
balls, you have Q equals 0.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:05.210
No energy changes
hands, so to speak.

00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:07.190
You just get some
kinetic energy from 1

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:11.870
being imparted to nucleus 2,
but you don't turn any mass

00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:12.590
into energy.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:17.330
So any questions here
before we go into--

00:13:17.330 --> 00:13:17.940
yes.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.880
AUDIENCE: If theta isn't
0 for cosine theta,

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.922
how would you plug it in?

00:13:20.922 --> 00:13:24.433
If you don't know what the angle
is, that it's not [INAUDIBLE]??

00:13:24.433 --> 00:13:25.850
MICHAEL SHORT: So
the question is,

00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:28.400
if you don't know the angle,
what do you do about it, right?

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:31.140
If you don't-- so in
this case, we've said,

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.330
what is the bare minimum
threshold for this reaction

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.860
to occur, and the best way for
that to happen is for theta

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.040
to equal 0.

00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.752
If theta is larger,
that will actually

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:42.210
mean that the reaction is not
allowed to proceed unless you

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.110
get to an even higher energy.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.290
So this condition still holds.

00:13:46.290 --> 00:13:53.140
But if cosine-- so let's say
if cosine theta is less than 1,

00:13:53.140 --> 00:13:58.410
then the value of s goes down,
and that makes this condition

00:13:58.410 --> 00:14:01.550
harder to satisfy.

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:03.140
So that's a good question.

00:14:03.140 --> 00:14:06.350
What that actually means is that
for certain nuclear reactions

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.060
very close to the
threshold energy,

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:09.760
only certain angles are allowed.

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.510
I'm not going to get
into the nitty-gritty

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:12.677
of which angles are allowed.

00:14:12.677 --> 00:14:13.940
I think it's--

00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:16.070
I'll call it minutia for
the scope of this class,

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:17.840
but it is in the
Yip reading, which

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.960
I'll be posting pretty soon.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.590
But suffice to say that the
only time you can-- let's say

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:26.050
if s squared plus t equals 0.

00:14:26.050 --> 00:14:28.600
The only time that can
happen is when theta

00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.700
equals 0 or cosine equals 1.

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.240
And that means that the nucleus
can only recoil in a very, very

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.130
narrow cone forward.

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:39.550
As that energy increases,
the allowable angles

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:42.018
start to increase further.

00:14:42.018 --> 00:14:43.310
Does that answer your question?

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.720
AUDIENCE: Well, yes.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.095
So you're just
saying [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:45.095 --> 00:14:48.500
0 is the minimum [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:51.310
MICHAEL SHORT: Or you'd say--
let's say if cosine equals 180.

00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:52.510
Then-- I'm sorry.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:54.680
If theta equals 180,
cosine would be negative 1.

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.330
And that would be, let's say,
the least favorable condition.

00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:00.404
Yes.

00:15:00.404 --> 00:15:04.180
AUDIENCE: Why did you
put the sigma total

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:07.490
under sigma elastic?

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.920
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, I'm saying--
so sigma elastic plus--

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.260
sorry-- sigma inelastic
would, let's say,

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.728
give you the total
scattering cross-section.

00:15:14.728 --> 00:15:16.520
AUDIENCE: And then what
was the green line?

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:19.460
MICHAEL SHORT: The green line--
oh, it is a little hard to see.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:22.620
The green line is the
inelastic cross-section.

00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:23.120
Yes.

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.280
I can imagine from
back there the green

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.620
and the white might look
a little similar, yes.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.280
OK, cool.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:29.780
Yes.

00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:31.820
Like one of these,
they give they give me

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.130
an almost black one.

00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.110
That's about as
invisible as it gets.

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:39.020
So make sure to
use visible colors.

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:39.950
OK.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:44.782
So now let's take the case of
elastic neutron scattering.

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:56.090
And can anyone tell me how
can we simplify the general Q

00:15:56.090 --> 00:15:58.610
equation for the
case of neutrons

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:00.910
hitting some random nucleus?

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:03.160
What can we start plugging
in for some of those values

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:03.952
to make it simpler?

00:16:08.073 --> 00:16:08.990
What about the masses?

00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:13.505
What's M1 in atomic mass units?

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:14.005
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:16:14.005 --> 00:16:17.345
MICHAEL SHORT: M1 is just 1 to
a pretty good approximation.

00:16:17.345 --> 00:16:22.940
It's actually 1.0087, which
we're going to say is 1.

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:25.770
And what about M3?

00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:26.640
AUDIENCE: 1.

00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:29.010
MICHAEL SHORT: Is
also-- yes, also 1.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:30.660
If this is elastic
neutron scattering,

00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:33.000
the same neutron
goes in and goes out.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.410
So M1 and M3 are the same thing.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:41.670
What about M2 and M4?

00:16:41.670 --> 00:16:45.320
Have we specified
what this nucleus is?

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:49.880
So what mass would we give it
if it's a general nucleus with N

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.160
neutrons and Z protons?

00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:51.660
AUDIENCE: A.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.200
MICHAEL SHORT: A, sure.

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.630
So A, that's again A
for the mass number.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.790
Cool.

00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.490
So with those in mind,
and then the last thing is

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.980
we only have T1 and T3.

00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:10.369
Just for clarity, let's call
T1 Tin, like the neutron energy

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:11.599
going in.

00:17:11.599 --> 00:17:14.450
And T3, we'll call Tout.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:20.960
So let's rewrite the
Q equation, the Q-eq,

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.819
with these symbols in there.

00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:24.829
And the last thing
to note, what's

00:17:24.829 --> 00:17:28.650
Q for elastic scattering?

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.220
0, yes.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:32.750
Because no mass is turned
into energy or vice versa.

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:37.180
So to rewrite the whole
Q equation, we'll get 0

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:45.520
equals Tin times M1 over
M4, which is just 1 over A,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:55.600
minus 1 plus Tout times
1 plus M3 over M4.

00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:04.670
M3 is also 1, M4 is also
A. And minus 2 root M1 M3.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.160
They're both 1.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:13.690
Tin Tout cosine theta.

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:15.570
So this looks a
whole lot simpler.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.480
I'm going to do one quick
thing right here and take

00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:22.440
the minus sign that's hiding
in here outside this equation.

00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:26.417
It's going to make the
form a lot simpler.

00:18:26.417 --> 00:18:28.500
So I'm just multiplying
the inside and the outside

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.375
of this term by negative
1, but hopefully you

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:31.920
can see that it's
the same thing.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.250
It will just make the form
a lot nicer in the end.

00:18:34.250 --> 00:18:35.850
And so now we want
to start asking,

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:39.120
what is the maximum
and minimum energy

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.895
that the neutron can lose?

00:18:41.895 --> 00:18:43.270
So let's start
with the easy one.

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:45.118
What is the minimum
amount of energy

00:18:45.118 --> 00:18:46.285
that the neutron could lose?

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:51.010
Anyone?

00:18:51.010 --> 00:18:52.420
I hear some whispers.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.260
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:54.290
MICHAEL SHORT: 0.

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:57.490
And if the neutron comes in--

00:18:57.490 --> 00:19:02.350
if theta equals
0, then you end up

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:08.230
with actually Tin
will equal Tout.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:13.720
And, that way, let's say
delta T1 or delta T neutron

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.920
could equal 0.

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:19.420
So a neutron can lose at
least none of its energy

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.810
in an elastic collision.

00:19:20.810 --> 00:19:22.310
Hopefully that makes
intuitive sense

00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:24.530
because we would
call that a miss.

00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.950
Now let's take the other case.

00:19:27.950 --> 00:19:30.680
At what angle would
you think the neutron

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:36.590
would transfer as much energy as
possible to the recoil nucleus?

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:39.360
So if we have a big
nucleus of mass A

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:46.230
and we have a little neutron
firing at it, at which angle

00:19:46.230 --> 00:19:47.850
does it transfer
the most energy?

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:52.230
Yes.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.930
AUDIENCE: Pi?

00:19:52.930 --> 00:19:53.812
If it's like--

00:19:53.812 --> 00:19:54.770
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:59.960
MICHAEL SHORT: At theta
equals pi, which means this--

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.720
we call this backscattering.

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.530
So, yes, good one.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.030
I'll correct your
statement, though.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:11.870
You said if the
neutron just stopped

00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:13.550
and the nucleus moved forward.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:16.300
Does not happen in every case.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.640
For example, if you were to--
and I'd say don't try this

00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:19.630
at home, kids--

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:23.800
put on a nice helmet and
run charging at a truck,

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.750
can you actually just stop cold?

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.180
And we're not assuming any
bones breaking or anything.

00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.080
Chances are you'd
bounce right back off.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:30.580
Yes.

00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.040
That's the analogy I like to
give for what happens when

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:34.930
a neutron scatters off uranium.

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.160
It's like running at a
truck with a helmet on.

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.940
It will just bounce back.

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:42.670
So in the case of
theta equals pi--

00:20:42.670 --> 00:20:47.760
so we're going to substitute
in theta equals pi.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.926
Therefore, cosine theta
equals negative 1,

00:20:51.926 --> 00:20:54.880
and we have an even
easier equation.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:21:03.610
0 equals, let's just say,
Tout times 1 plus 1 over A.

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:05.770
I'm going to arrange
these terms in order

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:10.120
of their exponent for Tout
since that's our variable again.

00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:15.460
And if this stuff is negative
1, then the 2 minus signs

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:18.890
cancel conveniently.

00:21:18.890 --> 00:21:25.550
And we have plus
2 root Tin Tout.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:26.050
Let's see.

00:21:26.050 --> 00:21:27.270
That's it.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:38.530
And we have minus Tin
times 1 over 1 minus A.

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.960
Ideally, we'd like to try
to simplify this as much

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:42.580
as possible.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.213
So let's combine.

00:21:44.213 --> 00:21:45.880
Let's try to get
everything in some sort

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.070
of a common denominator,
because that

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:49.720
would make things a lot easier.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:53.830
If we multiply each of
these 1's by A over A--

00:21:53.830 --> 00:22:03.970
so let's put that as a step,
because we can totally do

00:22:03.970 --> 00:22:05.770
that--

00:22:05.770 --> 00:22:12.220
we get 0 over Tout
times A over A plus 1

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:24.250
over A plus 2 root Tin
Tout minus Tin times A

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:28.270
over A minus 1 over A.

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:29.770
At this point, we can--

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:32.740
well, everything's in
common terms, right?

00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.480
We can just extend that fraction
sign and put the sign in here.

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:40.930
Extend the fraction sign,
put the sign in here.

00:22:43.882 --> 00:22:49.290
And we'll just say that's
A. We'll say that's A.

00:22:49.290 --> 00:22:52.110
Last step that we'll do
is try and isolate Tout

00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.840
so at least one of our quadratic
factors is going to be simple,

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.690
like 1.

00:22:56.690 --> 00:23:04.570
So next step,
divide by A plus 1.

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:10.810
And then we get 0 equals
just Tout plus 2 over A plus

00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:26.330
one root Tin Tout minus Tin
times A minus 1 over A plus 1.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:29.150
Now we've got a simple-looking
quadratic equation,

00:23:29.150 --> 00:23:31.490
even though it's quadratic
in the square root of Tout.

00:23:31.490 --> 00:23:31.990
Yes.

00:23:31.990 --> 00:23:35.368
AUDIENCE: What happened to
the A from the denominator?

00:23:35.368 --> 00:23:36.410
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's see.

00:23:36.410 --> 00:23:37.827
AUDIENCE: Could
it be Tout over A?

00:23:42.062 --> 00:23:43.270
MICHAEL SHORT: What did I do?

00:23:43.270 --> 00:23:45.320
Did I miss an A
or dividing by A?

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.760
AUDIENCE: The last
two equations.

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:47.870
MICHAEL SHORT: It's
from back here?

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:48.360
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.880
It's probably the
step you just did.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.260
MICHAEL SHORT: Just these steps.

00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:53.480
AUDIENCE: So you
divide by A plus 1.

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.980
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah, I see.

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.720
AUDIENCE: Should
it be Tout over A?

00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.565
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:57.565 --> 00:23:58.940
MICHAEL SHORT:
Yes, you're right.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.470
So I want to make
sure I didn't skip

00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:02.180
a step in dividing
an A. Let me just

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:04.172
check something real quick.

00:24:04.172 --> 00:24:05.630
AUDIENCE: There
should've been an A

00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:08.977
in the minus 2 square root.

00:24:08.977 --> 00:24:10.310
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, you're right.

00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:14.300
If we go back to
our Q equation--

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.190
let's see.

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:19.130
There's an M4
missing, isn't there?

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:21.296
That's it.

00:24:21.296 --> 00:24:22.220
Hah.

00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:26.150
See, this is what happens when
you don't look at your notes.

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.550
I'll go back and correct
those, because then there

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:35.240
should have been an over A.
There should have been an over

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.300
A. There should
have been an over A.

00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:40.710
Thank you for pointing that out.

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.100
And there should
have been another--

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:47.190
oh, in this case we can
just cancel all of the A's.

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:48.750
I knew it came out
nice and clean.

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:51.150
OK, cool.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:56.360
So at this point, this
is a quadratic in root

00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:03.350
Tout, where we have--

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:07.590
what are our a, b, and c terms
for this quadratic formula?

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.130
So what's a first of all if
it's quadratic in root Tout?

00:25:14.597 --> 00:25:15.550
AUDIENCE: 1?

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:16.482
MICHAEL SHORT: Just 1.

00:25:16.482 --> 00:25:18.440
That was part of the goal
of this manipulation,

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.440
is to make at least one of
these things pretty simple.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:22.010
What's b?

00:25:25.530 --> 00:25:29.048
AUDIENCE: 2 over A plus
1 times radical Tin?

00:25:29.048 --> 00:25:29.840
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.610
2 root Tin over A plus 1.

00:25:32.610 --> 00:25:34.590
And c is just that
whole term right there.

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:42.300
I'll do this up here.

00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:46.710
So then we can say root
Tout equals negative

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:55.360
b plus or minus the
square root of b squared.

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.110
So that's 4 Tin over
A plus 1 squared.

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:08.140
Minus 4 times a times c,
so just minus 4 times c.

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:18.820
So minus 4 times negative
Tin A minus 1 over A plus 1.

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:20.420
So let's see what cancels.

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.730
So, first of all, those
minus signs cancel.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.877
And everything has--
oh, and over 2a.

00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:28.960
Don't want to forget that.

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.620
Over 2a, which is just 2.

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.340
First thing we note is that
everything here has a 2 in it,

00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:40.850
either directly as a 2 or
hiding as a square root of 4.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.930
So we can cancel all of those.

00:26:42.930 --> 00:26:46.736
4, 4, 4, 4.

00:26:46.736 --> 00:26:50.565
Let me make sure that minus
sign is nice and visible.

00:26:50.565 --> 00:26:52.190
What else is common
to everything here?

00:27:00.748 --> 00:27:01.790
Well, I'll tell you what.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:04.160
I'll write it all out
simpler without all

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.200
the crossed-out stuff.

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:12.620
Minus root Tin over A
plus 1 plus or minus

00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:26.380
root Tin over A plus 1 squared
plus Tin times A minus 1

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.330
over A plus 1.

00:27:28.330 --> 00:27:30.220
So with that written
a little simpler,

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.188
what's also common and can be
factored out of everything?

00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:37.870
AUDIENCE: Square root of Ti?

00:27:37.870 --> 00:27:39.037
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:27:39.037 --> 00:27:40.240
Square root of Tin.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.232
Because there's a root Tin
here, and then you can--

00:27:43.232 --> 00:27:45.190
everything's got a Tin
inside the square roots.

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:47.590
You can pull that out.

00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:50.770
So we have a direct relation
between root Tout and root Tin.

00:27:54.490 --> 00:27:58.660
Minus 1 over A plus
1 plus or minus

00:27:58.660 --> 00:28:10.180
root 1 over A plus 1 squared
plus A minus 1 over A plus 1.

00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.568
What do we do here to
simplify all the junk

00:28:12.568 --> 00:28:13.360
in the square root?

00:28:21.690 --> 00:28:25.273
AUDIENCE: Multiply the right
side by A plus 1 over A plus 1.

00:28:25.273 --> 00:28:26.440
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.700
You can always multiply by
something, better known as 1.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.660
And that gets
everything here-- just

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.380
like there was a 2 or a root
4 everywhere in the equation,

00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:37.870
or there was a root
Tin and a root Tin

00:28:37.870 --> 00:28:39.490
everywhere else in
the equation, we'll

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:42.430
do the same thing to get
the A plus 1 out of there.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:48.078
So we'll multiply this by
A plus 1 over A plus 1.

00:28:48.078 --> 00:28:49.120
I'll stick it over there.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:54.190
OK.

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:58.660
And we get root Tout equals--

00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:03.400
now everything has an A
plus 1, so let's bring all

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.875
of those outside the fraction.

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:18.740
Root Tin over A plus
1 times negative 1

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:27.070
plus or minus the square root
of 1 plus A minus 1, A plus 1.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:29.330
Starting to get a lot simpler.

00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:32.250
Let's see how much-- if I run
out of space for this one.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:36.020
So this stuff right
here is just A squared

00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:40.180
minus A plus A minus 1.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:44.390
The minus A and the
plus A cancel out.

00:29:44.390 --> 00:29:47.580
And then the plus 1 and
the minus 1 cancel out.

00:29:47.580 --> 00:29:50.480
And all that's inside the
square root is A squared.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.600
So the only hopefully
nonlinear board technique,

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.470
I'm going to move to the left.

00:29:55.470 --> 00:30:04.010
And we end up with root Tout
equals root Tin over A plus 1.

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:08.380
And all that's left
there is A minus 1

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.390
if we take the positive root.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.840
Almost done.

00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.318
Just square both sides.

00:30:18.318 --> 00:30:20.110
And we should arrive
at a result that might

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:22.480
look familiar to some of you.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:32.790
Tout equals Tin times A minus
1 over A plus 1 squared.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:34.850
And we've gotten to
the point now where

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.780
we can determine how much energy
the neutron can possibly lose

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.610
or the recoil
nucleus can possibly

00:30:40.610 --> 00:30:43.680
gain in an elastic collision.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:45.650
It's this factor right here.

00:30:45.650 --> 00:30:48.620
I'll use the red since
it's more visible.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:54.860
This is usually referred to
in nuclear textbooks as alpha.

00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:58.860
It's sort of the maximum amount
of energy a neutron can lose

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.450
or a recoil nucleus can gain.

00:31:01.450 --> 00:31:07.380
So what we've arrived at is
a pretty important result,

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:13.730
that, let's say, the energy,
the kinetic energy of a neutron,

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:20.600
has to be between its initial
kinetic energy and alpha times

00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:22.610
its initial kinetic energy.

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:24.890
This right here is one
of the ways in which you

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:27.470
choose a moderator
or a slowing down

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:30.420
medium for neutrons in reactors.

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:32.880
So it's this alpha
factor right here

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.230
that really distinguishes
what we call a thermal--

00:31:35.230 --> 00:31:36.240
or what is it?

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.310
Like a light water reactor
or a thermal spectrum

00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:41.610
reactor from a fast
spectrum reactor.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:45.020
Let's look at a couple of
limiting cases to see why.

00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:45.920
Let's see.

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.600
Anyone mind if I
hide this board here?

00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.290
Or you have a question?

00:31:48.290 --> 00:31:48.873
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:53.030
Can you explain why you ended
up dropping the negative case?

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:54.080
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's see.

00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.820
If we took the negative case,
we'd end up with minus 1

00:31:58.820 --> 00:32:05.010
minus A. You just have
an A plus 1 on the top.

00:32:05.010 --> 00:32:05.510
Yes.

00:32:05.510 --> 00:32:07.060
So in that case, you just have--

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.790
let's see.

00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:10.040
You just have root Tin, right?

00:32:12.930 --> 00:32:13.430
Let me see.

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:15.472
AUDIENCE: Negative
root Tin actually.

00:32:15.472 --> 00:32:16.430
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, yes.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:18.650
So that wouldn't make
very much sense, right?

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:19.340
Yes.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.522
So in that case, well, you don't
want to have a negative energy.

00:32:22.522 --> 00:32:24.230
So that case doesn't
make physical sense.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:26.210
Thanks for making sure
we explained that.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.520
And did I see another question?

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.020
Yes.

00:32:28.020 --> 00:32:28.603
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:32:28.603 --> 00:32:30.320
What happened to
the coefficients

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:31.400
you had before Tin?

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:33.125
You had 4.

00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:34.900
You needed 4 or 2,
but [INAUDIBLE]..

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:35.650
MICHAEL SHORT: Ah.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:36.150
OK.

00:32:36.150 --> 00:32:39.500
So what I did is I took the
square root of 4 out of every

00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:42.950
term inside the square root
and said, OK, they're all 2's.

00:32:42.950 --> 00:32:44.930
Just like in the next
step, I said, all right,

00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.600
there's all of these
A plus 1's, including

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.360
all of these A plus 1's
squares inside the square root,

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:51.530
and took that out.

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:52.760
Or I think even over here.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.610
Yes, so the whole thing here
has been combine and destroy.

00:32:58.197 --> 00:33:00.780
Any other questions on what we
did here before I go on to some

00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.238
of the implications
of what we got?

00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.432
Cool.

00:33:05.432 --> 00:33:07.015
Let's look at a
couple limiting cases.

00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:13.390
I'll rewrite that inequality
right there because that's

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:14.640
the important one of the day.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.220
So what is alpha for
typical materials?

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:28.940
Let's say for hydrogen.
Alpha equals--

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:34.160
well, it's always A minus
1 over A plus 1 squared.

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.990
And for hydrogen, A
equals equals 1, equals 1.

00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:40.730
And then we have 1 minus
1 in the numerator.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:42.860
Alpha equals 0.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:45.620
What this means is that
for the case of hydrogen,

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:51.694
you can lose all of the neutron
energy in a single collision.

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.260
That doesn't mean that you lose
all energy in every collision

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.215
with a hydrogen atom
if you're a neutron,

00:34:01.215 --> 00:34:02.590
but it means that
you can lose up

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:05.710
to all of your energy
in one single collision.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:08.800
And this is what makes
hydrogen such a good moderator

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.770
or a slower down of neutrons,
is when it undergoes

00:34:11.770 --> 00:34:15.820
elastic scattering, especially
at energies below an MeV or so,

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.790
which is where most of the
neutrons in the reactor are,

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.050
it just bounces around.

00:34:20.050 --> 00:34:22.030
And the more it hits
hydrogens, the more

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:25.222
it imparts energy to those
hydrogens and slows down.

00:34:25.222 --> 00:34:26.889
Why do we want to
slow the neutrons down

00:34:26.889 --> 00:34:28.460
in the first place?

00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.219
Well, that has to do with
another cross-section,

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.219
that I'm going to draw
if I can find some chalk.

00:34:36.531 --> 00:34:37.989
Like I think I've
mentioned before,

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:42.080
every nuclear reaction
has its own cross-section.

00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:46.219
And this time I'm going to
introduce a new one called

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:50.840
sigma fission, the probability,
if a nucleus absorbs

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.179
a neutron, that it undergoes
fission and creates

00:34:53.179 --> 00:34:57.540
more neutrons and like
200 MeV of recoil energy.

00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:01.760
So in this case, I'll
draw it for U235,

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.250
since this is the one I pretty
much remember from memory.

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:08.240
And it looks
something like that.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:12.650
So what you want is for the
neutrons to be at low energies.

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:17.240
So this would be around the
thermal energy, better known

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.180
as about 0.025 eV.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:22.490
Your goal is that the
more neutrons that you

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:25.020
have in this energy region--

00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:27.890
oh, that chalk
erases other chalk.

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:31.010
The more neutrons you have in
that energy region, the higher

00:35:31.010 --> 00:35:32.720
probability you have a fission.

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.270
So this is the basis
behind thermal reactors,

00:35:35.270 --> 00:35:39.200
is the neutrons all start here.

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.740
They're born at
around 1 to 10 MeV.

00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:48.100
They don't undergo fission
very well at 1 to 10 MeV.

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.590
So your goal as a
thermal reactor designer

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:53.840
is to slow them down as
efficiently as possible.

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.130
What's the most efficient
way to slow down neutrons?

00:35:57.130 --> 00:35:59.680
Cram the reactor
full of hydrogen.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:03.810
What's the cheapest and most
hydrogenous substance we know?

00:36:03.810 --> 00:36:05.250
Water.

00:36:05.250 --> 00:36:10.000
This is why water makes such
a good reactor moderator.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.020
It's pretty cool.

00:36:11.020 --> 00:36:13.770
There's also lots of other
reasons that we use water.

00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.650
It's everywhere, which is
another way of saying cheap.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.330
It's pretty chemically inert.

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:20.070
There are corrosion
problems in reactors,

00:36:20.070 --> 00:36:22.710
but it doesn't just
spontaneously combust

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:26.880
when you see air, like sodium
does, another reactor coolant.

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.490
It takes a lot of
energy to heat it up.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:34.242
So it's specific heat
capacity, the CP of water,

00:36:34.242 --> 00:36:34.950
if you remember--

00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:42.210
I think it's-- was it
4.184 joules per gram?

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.645
That's a point.

00:36:44.645 --> 00:36:47.100
One of the highest
substances that we know of.

00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.800
So you can put a lot
of that recoil energy

00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:52.350
or a lot of heat
energy into this water

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:54.000
without raising its
temperature as much

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.740
as a comparative substance.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.137
Metals can have heat capacity's
like three or four times lower.

00:36:59.137 --> 00:37:01.470
So you wouldn't necessarily
want to use a metal coolant.

00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.180
Or would you?

00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:05.700
In what cases would you
want to use a metal coolant

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:06.630
for a reactor?

00:37:06.630 --> 00:37:10.140
Has anyone ever heard of
liquid metal reactors before?

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:10.900
Just a couple.

00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:11.400
Good.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:13.350
I get to be the first
one to tell you.

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:16.980
I did my whole PhD on alloys
for the liquid lead reactor.

00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:23.230
So let's take a look at lead,
which has an A of about--

00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:26.050
let's call it 200.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.390
I think there's some
isotopes, like 203 or so.

00:37:28.390 --> 00:37:31.390
There's probably an
isotope called lead 200.

00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:33.790
What would alpha be for lead?

00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:39.220
Well, let's just
plug in the numbers.

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:41.842
A minus 1 is 199.

00:37:41.842 --> 00:37:44.740
A plus 1 is 201.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:45.520
Square that.

00:37:48.250 --> 00:37:51.080
Almost 1.

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:51.580
Almost.

00:37:54.160 --> 00:37:57.910
This means that when neutrons
hit something like lead,

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:00.040
basically don't slow down.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.240
They can lose at least
none and at most almost

00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.032
none of their energy.

00:38:06.032 --> 00:38:07.490
And this is the
basis behind what's

00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:10.820
called fast reactors if you
want to use a coolant that

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.190
keeps the neutrons very fast.

00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:15.918
Because for uranium 238,
there's what's called a--

00:38:15.918 --> 00:38:17.960
well, what you do is you
want to capture neutrons

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.670
with uranium 238, make plutonium
239, and then breed that.

00:38:22.670 --> 00:38:29.493
Or uranium 238 has got its
fast fission cross-section.

00:38:29.493 --> 00:38:31.910
I don't think I want to get
into bringing it on the screen

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:34.590
today since we're
almost five of five of.

00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:36.590
What I will say is there's
lots of other reactor

00:38:36.590 --> 00:38:37.950
coolants besides water.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.950
And it sounds to me like
almost no one had heard

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:41.450
of a liquid metal reactor.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:43.370
Why would you want
to use a liquid metal

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:48.760
as a coolant besides keeping
the neutrons at high energy?

00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:49.690
Anyone have any ideas?

00:38:53.500 --> 00:38:57.050
What sort of properties do
you want out of a coolant?

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:59.790
Not even for a reactor
but for anything.

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:00.790
AUDIENCE: Heat transfer.

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:02.470
MICHAEL SHORT:
Good heat transfer.

00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.110
Metals are extremely
thermally conductive.

00:39:05.110 --> 00:39:07.750
So if you want to get the
heat out of the fuel rods

00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:09.850
and into the coolant and
then out to make steam

00:39:09.850 --> 00:39:12.790
for a turbine, liquid metals
are a pretty awesome coolant

00:39:12.790 --> 00:39:16.540
to use because they conduct
heat extremely well.

00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.080
What else?

00:39:19.630 --> 00:39:20.740
Let's try and think now.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.360
If you were a reactor
designer, you don't just

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.130
have to make the reactor
work but you want

00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.450
to make it avoid accidents.

00:39:26.450 --> 00:39:29.710
What sort of thermodynamic
properties about metals

00:39:29.710 --> 00:39:31.738
could prevent accidents
from happening?

00:39:31.738 --> 00:39:32.828
AUDIENCE: They solidify.

00:39:32.828 --> 00:39:33.620
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:34.740
So there's one problem.

00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:36.170
They could solidify.

00:39:36.170 --> 00:39:38.810
So coolants that have
been chosen for reactors

00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:41.660
have been things like
sodium, which melts just

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:44.840
below 100 Celsius, liquid
lead-bismuth, which

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.550
melts at 123 Celsius.

00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.180
And I know because I've
it in a frying pan before.

00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.590
So I did four years of research
on liquid lead-bismuth,

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:54.110
and if there's anyone that's
gotten enough exposure to that,

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:54.800
it's me.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.750
It does not seem to
have affected my brain

00:39:56.750 --> 00:39:59.780
too much because I only
made like two major mistakes

00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:01.580
on today's board.

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.480
Good enough.

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:03.980
Yes.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:07.370
So we've got hundreds of pounds
of lead-bismuth sitting around.

00:40:07.370 --> 00:40:08.990
It's pretty inert stuff.

00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:13.500
It's really dense, so it
can store a lot of heat.

00:40:13.500 --> 00:40:16.030
The other thing is
the boiling point.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.280
Anyone know what
temperature metals boil at?

00:40:21.022 --> 00:40:22.850
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.130
MICHAEL SHORT:
Extremely high, yes.

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:31.250
Sodium boils at approximately
exactly 893 degrees Celsius.

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:36.080
Liquid lead-bismuth boils at
approximately exactly 1,670

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.130
Celsius.

00:40:37.130 --> 00:40:39.110
You'll actually melt the
steel that the reactor

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:41.780
is made of before you
boil off your coolant.

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.370
And if you boil
your coolant, you

00:40:43.370 --> 00:40:44.870
have no way of
cooling the reactor,

00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:46.760
and that's something
you want to avoid.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:51.510
Water boils at
approximately 325--

00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:56.750
let's say 288 to 340 Celsius
depending on the pressure

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:58.310
that's used in the reactors.

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.470
And that does get reached
sometimes, especially

00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:01.940
in accident conditions.

00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:05.450
So if you want to make something
relatively Fukushima-proof,

00:41:05.450 --> 00:41:07.490
then you don't want
the coolant to boil.

00:41:07.490 --> 00:41:11.950
So use a liquid metal, which
introduces other problems.

00:41:11.950 --> 00:41:14.040
It also introduces
some other problems.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.190
I'm going to flash forward a bit
to neutrons and reactor design.

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:20.757
Because it does take time for
this scattering to happen.

00:41:20.757 --> 00:41:22.590
These collisions, they
happen pretty quickly

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:25.270
but they do take a
finite amount of time.

00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:26.820
And in the meantime,
you can have

00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:29.100
what's called
feedback coefficients,

00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.130
natural bits of physics that
help your reactor stay stable

00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:35.040
or they don't, depending
on whether it's called

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:37.950
negative or positive feedback.

00:41:37.950 --> 00:41:42.540
So we can have either
negative or positive feedback.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.750
I'll give you one simple
example that I'll just

00:41:49.750 --> 00:41:52.180
introduce conceptually,
and we'll actually

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.890
explain it a little
mathematically later

00:41:53.890 --> 00:41:55.010
in the course.

00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:57.400
Let's talk about
coolant density.

00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.650
If you were to heat
up your reactor

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:02.923
and the coolant were
to get less dense,

00:42:02.923 --> 00:42:04.840
what do you think would
happen to the reaction

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:09.040
rate of, well, anything--
scattering, fission,

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.408
absorption?

00:42:10.408 --> 00:42:11.650
AUDIENCE: Go down.

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:12.430
MICHAEL SHORT: It
should go down.

00:42:12.430 --> 00:42:13.472
Why do you think that is?

00:42:13.472 --> 00:42:15.852
AUDIENCE: Because there's
not as many particles that's

00:42:15.852 --> 00:42:17.732
close together, so [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:17.732 --> 00:42:18.690
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:19.570
Yes.

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:22.120
To reintroduce a bit of the
cross-section stuff I mentioned

00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.270
last time, the
microscopic cross-section

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:27.760
is the probability that,
let's say, one nucleus

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:30.140
hits one other nucleus.

00:42:30.140 --> 00:42:32.920
If you then multiply
by the number density

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.290
or how many of
them are there, you

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.260
end up with the
macroscopic cross-section.

00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:43.330
So I'll label this as
micro, label this as macro.

00:42:43.330 --> 00:42:46.560
And then the macroscopic
cross-section

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:52.930
times your neutron flux
gives you your reaction rate.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:56.110
So if you want to get less
moderating happening, or less

00:42:56.110 --> 00:42:58.570
fission, or less
absorption, the simplest way

00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.270
is-- well, that's a
property of the material.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:03.310
That's whatever your
reactor is doing.

00:43:03.310 --> 00:43:04.960
You can decrease
the number density

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:08.630
by heating things up and
decreasing the density.

00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:11.600
So this is one of those cases
where you can use the reactor

00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:14.780
to quickly respond with physics
before you could respond

00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:16.280
with human intervention.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.590
If you want, let's
say, a extra power

00:43:18.590 --> 00:43:21.380
transient or a sudden
increase in heat

00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:24.200
to slow down the nuclear
reaction and not speed it up,

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:27.870
you'd pick a moderator
that behaves in this way.

00:43:27.870 --> 00:43:30.410
So in this case, water
would get less dense,

00:43:30.410 --> 00:43:34.400
it would moderate less
well, and put fewer neutrons

00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:37.600
in the high-probability
fission region.

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:39.130
Then let's think
about what happens

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:42.460
if you're depending on
your neutrons to stay fast

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.840
or at high energy.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:46.240
Let's say you were to
have a really bad day

00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:48.840
and boil your liquid sodium.

00:43:48.840 --> 00:43:51.150
All of a sudden, what
little moderating power

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:55.350
exists in that sodium
disappears or gets even lower,

00:43:55.350 --> 00:43:58.380
and that would cause your
reactor power to increase.

00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:01.530
So one of the dangers of
fast spectrum reactors

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:04.740
is positive-- what's called
positive void coefficient.

00:44:04.740 --> 00:44:08.310
Or if you make a bubble
of gaseous sodium,

00:44:08.310 --> 00:44:10.830
your power increases
rather than decreases.

00:44:10.830 --> 00:44:12.120
That would increase the heat.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.620
That would cause
the power to go up.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.828
That would increase the heat.

00:44:14.828 --> 00:44:16.410
That would cause
the power to go up.

00:44:16.410 --> 00:44:18.660
Luckily, there are many,
many other negative feedback

00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:20.610
mechanisms that
could be built in

00:44:20.610 --> 00:44:23.700
to make sure the overall
feedback coefficients are still

00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:26.540
negative.

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:29.240
This also lets us understand
a little bit about what

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.400
went wrong at Chernobyl.

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.660
And I'll give you a
1-minute flashforward.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.140
Because the control
rods that were made of--

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:36.860
let's see.

00:44:36.860 --> 00:44:40.280
I don't remember what the
composition of the control rods

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.920
is, but they were
neutron absorbers.

00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:46.290
The control rods in
Chernobyl looked something

00:44:46.290 --> 00:44:50.490
like this, where there
was the absorber here.

00:44:50.490 --> 00:44:54.730
And this was-- they
were graphite tipped.

00:44:54.730 --> 00:44:58.230
And as you lower that graphite
down into the reactor,

00:44:58.230 --> 00:45:00.560
you're all of a sudden
introducing something.

00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:02.930
Well, that's an OK moderator.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:05.730
For carbon, let's
say A equals 12.

00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:12.950
So our alpha will be A
minus 1 over A plus 1.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:14.870
I'm not going to write
almost equal to 1

00:45:14.870 --> 00:45:17.470
because that isn't
quite almost equal to 1.

00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:18.720
What does this actually equal?

00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:19.220
Let's see.

00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.610
Let's just say
definitely less than 1.

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.040
There is some moderating
power to graphite.

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:29.350
It's also a very bad absorber.

00:45:29.350 --> 00:45:32.020
And what this meant, that
as you lowered those control

00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.210
rods into the reactor,
you suddenly introduced

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:37.300
a little more moderation when
things were already going bad,

00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:40.263
and that caused the power
level to increase further.

00:45:40.263 --> 00:45:41.680
There were other
problems, like it

00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.710
was designed so that if you
boiled some of the coolant,

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:46.623
you would have
positive feedback.

00:45:46.623 --> 00:45:48.790
And that is the sort of
1-minute synopsis as to what

00:45:48.790 --> 00:45:50.470
all went haywire at Chernobyl.

00:45:50.470 --> 00:45:53.350
But we'll be doing a second
by second or, in some cases,

00:45:53.350 --> 00:45:55.660
millisecond by
millisecond play of what

00:45:55.660 --> 00:45:57.662
went wrong with Chernobyl.

00:45:57.662 --> 00:45:59.620
And we could probably do
the same for Fukushima

00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:02.710
now, now that we understand what
happened, based on the physics

00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:05.740
you'll be learning
in this course.

00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:08.070
And this is actually a
perfect stopping point,

00:46:08.070 --> 00:46:09.990
because next up we're
going to be looking

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.810
at the different processes
of radioactive decay,

00:46:12.810 --> 00:46:14.910
many of which are a
simplification of this Q

00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:17.190
equation, and I
think some of which

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:18.660
are probably
familiar to you guys,

00:46:18.660 --> 00:46:22.680
because radiation decay is
part of the normal lexicon,

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.060
especially nowadays.

00:46:24.060 --> 00:46:26.380
So since it's five of
five of, do you guys

00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:28.380
have any questions on
what we've covered so far?

00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:31.140
Yes.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] if you
have water as your coolant

00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:36.912
and it gets too
hot, [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:39.768 --> 00:46:40.560
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:40.800
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:42.114
And that will decrease
the reaction rate.

00:46:42.114 --> 00:46:42.990
MICHAEL SHORT: Um-hm.

00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:47.690
AUDIENCE: And that's how
like the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:46:47.690 --> 00:46:49.005
MICHAEL SHORT: It's actually--

00:46:49.005 --> 00:46:50.380
are you asking
about it the water

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.760
feedback is part of the backup?

00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.160
That's your primary
line of defense.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.780
Your backup is
human intervention,

00:46:55.780 --> 00:46:57.280
because, compared
to physics, humans

00:46:57.280 --> 00:47:00.340
are really, really slow,
like many orders of magnitude

00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.360
slower.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.540
It takes microseconds for
things to thermally expand.

00:47:04.540 --> 00:47:07.870
It definitely takes more than
seconds for a human to respond.

00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:10.493
Anyone ever done those tests
where you have a light blinking

00:47:10.493 --> 00:47:12.910
and you have to hit a button
the second you see the light?

00:47:12.910 --> 00:47:16.970
What's the fastest any of
you guys have ever responded?

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:18.420
Anyone remember?

00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:20.646
Anyone beat a second?

00:47:20.646 --> 00:47:21.545
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:47:21.545 --> 00:47:22.420
MICHAEL SHORT: Maybe.

00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:24.294
A tenth of a second?

00:47:24.294 --> 00:47:28.590
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:31.202
MICHAEL SHORT: And there all
you have to do is hit a button.

00:47:31.202 --> 00:47:32.910
All you have to do is
hit the only button

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:34.925
when you see the only light.

00:47:34.925 --> 00:47:36.300
What if you're
piloting something

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:38.310
that's about as complicated
as the space shuttle

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:40.500
but more likely to explode?

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:43.920
What do you think your
reaction time will be?

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.820
Probably long.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:48.330
You'll probably have
to pull out the manual.

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.690
And probably you'll have
to RTFM for a little while.

00:47:51.690 --> 00:47:54.510
And maybe you'll find out what
you have to do and maybe you

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:55.410
won't.

00:47:55.410 --> 00:47:57.210
So it's actually
operator error that

00:47:57.210 --> 00:48:00.660
has caused most of the near
misses or actual misses

00:48:00.660 --> 00:48:01.560
in nuclear reactors.

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:04.710
The physics, except for
the Russian RBMK design

00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:07.140
that was for
Chernobyl, usually it's

00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.150
human error that's the
downfall of these things.

00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:12.130
So by understanding
the physics here,

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:15.130
we can rely on it
to keep things safe.

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:15.630
Yes.

00:48:15.630 --> 00:48:17.330
AUDIENCE: When you
have a lead reactor--

00:48:17.330 --> 00:48:23.623
or I don't know [INAUDIBLE] one
of these, but what is like--

00:48:23.623 --> 00:48:25.790
how do you cool the lead
once it starts getting hot?

00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:27.165
MICHAEL SHORT:
Ah, good question.

00:48:27.165 --> 00:48:28.610
How do you cool the liquid lead?

00:48:28.610 --> 00:48:31.010
You can't send liquid led
through a turbine, right?

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:33.260
So at some point you've got
to make steam and use that

00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:34.550
to drive a turbine.

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:36.620
You can use what's
called a heat exchanger.

00:48:36.620 --> 00:48:42.140
At its simplest, you can think
of it like a couple of tubes

00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:45.160
where the lead is
going through here

00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.670
and the steam is
going through here.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:52.700
And they have a very thin
barrier between them,

00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:56.870
so you have all this heat moving
from the lead, which is hotter,

00:48:56.870 --> 00:48:58.838
to the steam, which is colder.

00:48:58.838 --> 00:49:01.130
They actually have built a
bunch of these led reactors.

00:49:01.130 --> 00:49:01.910
AUDIENCE: Is that real?

00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:02.702
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:49:02.702 --> 00:49:05.630
The Russian fast attack
subs, the alpha class subs,

00:49:05.630 --> 00:49:08.870
were powered by and are
powered by liquid led reactors.

00:49:08.870 --> 00:49:12.090
They're the only reactor
that can outrun a torpedo.

00:49:12.090 --> 00:49:14.083
So when you have a liquid
lead reactor powering

00:49:14.083 --> 00:49:15.750
and you've got a panic
button that says,

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:16.950
forget the safety systems.

00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:17.880
Outrun a torpedo.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:21.240
You have a choice between maybe
dying in a reactor explosion

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.150
and definitely getting shot out
of the water with a torpedo.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.620
You do whatever you can.

00:49:25.620 --> 00:49:28.950
And these subs only run
two or three not slower

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:30.210
than a torpedo.

00:49:30.210 --> 00:49:32.460
So just like that
old algebra problem,

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:35.730
if this guy leaves
Pittsburgh at 8 AM traveling

00:49:35.730 --> 00:49:38.220
40 miles an hour, and I'm
trying to get to Boston,

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:41.640
30 miles an hour, if a
torpedo leaves one sub moving

00:49:41.640 --> 00:49:44.370
this velocity and the
alpha attack sub senses it

00:49:44.370 --> 00:49:45.870
from this distance
and starts moving

00:49:45.870 --> 00:49:48.330
at a similar velocity,
chances are the torpedo

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:51.930
runs out of steam before
it reaches the alpha sub.

00:49:51.930 --> 00:49:54.390
And that's only because
they can have an extremely

00:49:54.390 --> 00:49:58.237
compact liquid lead nuclear
reactor at the power source.

00:49:58.237 --> 00:50:01.060
AUDIENCE: So can
you [INAUDIBLE]??

00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.150
How do you move [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:03.150 --> 00:50:04.810
MICHAEL SHORT: Good question.

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:05.650
How do you use the--

00:50:05.650 --> 00:50:07.020
how do you move the liquid lead?

00:50:07.020 --> 00:50:08.760
You can move it by
natural convection

00:50:08.760 --> 00:50:10.500
but that's extremely slow.

00:50:10.500 --> 00:50:12.210
So there are multiple
ways of moving it.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.810
One of the cool ones is called
an EM or Electromagnetic pump.

00:50:15.810 --> 00:50:18.600
It induces eddy currents
in the liquid lead

00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:20.610
because it's also a conductor.

00:50:20.610 --> 00:50:24.690
And those eddy currents couple
with the EM field from the EM

00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.700
pump and cause the lead to
just start moving on its own.

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.670
So it's a no moving parts pump.

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:33.540
The only problem is it's
like 1% or 2% efficient.

00:50:33.540 --> 00:50:34.282
Yes.

00:50:34.282 --> 00:50:35.740
So they only use
those on the subs,

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:40.000
but you can use EM pumps to
move conductive coolants.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.190
So I think it's pretty awesome.

00:50:42.190 --> 00:50:44.580
And there have there have
been land submarines.

00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:47.070
In fact, there's a company
called AKME Engineering

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.040
in Russia that's
trying to commercialize

00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.630
a small modular
liquid lead reactor.

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:54.390
The other nice thing about
these liquid metal coolants

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:56.470
is you can make
the reactors much,

00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:59.880
much smaller and denser than
in a light water reactor.

00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.520
In a light water reactor,
you're relying on a lot of water

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.290
to cool things
and a lot of water

00:51:04.290 --> 00:51:07.382
to be there to
moderate your neutrons.

00:51:07.382 --> 00:51:09.840
In a liquid metal reactor,
where you don't need moderation,

00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:11.298
well, you don't
need-- all you need

00:51:11.298 --> 00:51:13.040
is enough coolant
to keep things cool.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.248
So you can tighten stuff up
and make it more compact.

00:51:17.223 --> 00:51:19.640
So that's one of the nuclear
startups coming out nowadays.

00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.860
This is an awesome
time to be in nuclear.

00:51:21.860 --> 00:51:24.800
When I started nuclear, there
were approximately exactly

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.480
zero nuclear startups.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.550
Like TerraPower
didn't even exist yet.

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:32.793
Now there's something
like 52 in the US

00:51:32.793 --> 00:51:33.960
and others around the world.

00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.240
So like this is the time
to be in nuclear if you're

00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.360
up for startups and not
just working in academia,

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.900
or a lab, or a big corporation.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:43.770
There's a lot of little
companies now doing

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:48.385
some crazy things based on
some pretty good physics.

00:51:48.385 --> 00:51:50.760
So maybe time for one more
question before I let you guys

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:51.260
go.

00:51:54.650 --> 00:51:56.930
If not, then I'll see
you guys on Tuesday

00:51:56.930 --> 00:51:59.053
when we start radioactive decay.

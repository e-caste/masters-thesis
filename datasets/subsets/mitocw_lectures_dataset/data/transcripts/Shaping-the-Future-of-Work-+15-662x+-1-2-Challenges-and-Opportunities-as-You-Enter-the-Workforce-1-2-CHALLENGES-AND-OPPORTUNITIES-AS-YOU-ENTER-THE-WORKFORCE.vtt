WEBVTT

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.450
Issues that arise
at work are often

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.660
a reflection of
problems occurring

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.840
in the larger society
and the tensions

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.810
that we're seeing
out there today.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:18.440
So today, unfortunately
all around the world,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.250
we're seeing conflicts,
sometimes verbal attacks,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.020
sometimes physical attacks.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.830
Maybe it's refugees from Syria
or other war-torn countries

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.400
trying to find a place
to live in Europe.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.490
Maybe it's a tax on immigrants.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.310
Maybe in the United
States, now it

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.170
seems to be attacks on
religious groups, Muslims.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.750
Sometimes now we're seeing
racial conflicts rise again.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.850
So we thought it would
be useful in this course

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.480
to have a conversation about
how these conflicts then affect

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.280
the workplace, and
what we've learned

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.240
over the years about how to
address them effectively.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.490
And we're fortunate to have
a world-class expert here

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:02.160
to draw on.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.780
I'm talking today with
Professor Mary Rowe, a friend

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.580
and colleague here
in the Sloan School.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:12.960
Mary has been the ombudsperson
for MIT for 40 years,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.330
and she's now taking
time to reflect

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.060
on the lessons she learned
from that experience

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.920
and its implications for
how we can move forward.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.430
So Mary, thank you
for joining us today.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.670
My pleasure.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.720
So why don't we start
right at the beginning.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.340
What is an ombudsman or a
ombudsperson or ombuds--

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.300
whatever the
appropriate term is?

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.730
And what does a person
in that role do?

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.170
An organizational ombud--
and there's lots of us

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.250
now around the world.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.160
I'm guessing that there
are probably about 1,000

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.320
of us in corporations
and government agencies

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.170
and academic institutions
around the world.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.300
It's a neutral.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.880
Many people know
what a mediator does.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.470
And if you can imagine
an internal mediator who

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.860
works on any kind of problem
that comes to him or her,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.410
that begins the picture.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.479
We're independent of all
line and staff offices.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.370
By standards of
practice, we report

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.320
to the chief executive officer
or above him or her to a board.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:17.960
We're informal.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.720
We don't have any
management power.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.500
We can't fix anything.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.510
And we are confidential.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.240
That's perhaps the most
important thing for your talk

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.060
today.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.150
We keep no case records
for our organizations.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.330
Anybody can-- we're called
a zero-barrier office.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.310
We should establish
an office where

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.250
there are no barriers
at all to being

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.490
able to come to talk with us.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.150
Well, that's a
good introduction.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.690
And I know you have emphasized
the need for multiple tools

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.300
to fit into what you have called
a conflict management system.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.370
Could you describe what
some of these tools

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.780
are that are needed for people
in your role to be effective?

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.940
Well, people in my role
need various kinds of tools.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.270
We think of a sense of humor,
integrity, intelligence,

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.480
caring.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.850
Especially important,
especially because of what

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.940
you were saying before about
the origins of conflict,

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.280
we think of ombudsmen
as needing to have a lot

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:26.830
of cross-cultural experience.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.090
And indeed, my profession is
one of the best integrated

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.030
professions in the world
by race and by gender.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.180
I'm very proud of that.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:37.280
But I think you're
also thinking about

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.790
what needs to be in an
organizational system

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.320
to deal with conflicts in the
workplace and with students,

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.890
and so on.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:45.530
Is that right?

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.170
That's right.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:49.840
Some of the tools and the
options that I know you

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.890
consider important.

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:53.880
Lots of people who think
about this question

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.580
think first about, do we have
a formal grievance procedure?

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.260
And that, of course, is
a very important question

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.680
for the most grievous
problems and the ones that

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.680
need a management decision.

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.750
But most problems will
yield to people thinking

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.080
about their own
interests and those

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.160
of others at what
people-- at what

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.120
organizations think of as
the lowest possible level.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.600
So at the lowest
possible level, we

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.370
want conflict settled
onsite, if possible.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.880
And at the last
end of the line, we

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.700
would think of formal
grievance procedures,

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.130
and then there are lots and
lots of steps in between.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:38.770
And some of those
steps really empower

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.900
individuals to deal with
conflicts more effectively.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.690
And I know you have spent
a lot of time working

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.850
to help individuals
figure out what

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.730
options are best for her or
for him in addressing these.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.050
What would some of
those options be?

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:55.530
When people think
about ombudsmen

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:58.150
or when they think about
taking an ombuds job,

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.010
they often think about
conflict management

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.920
as dispute resolution.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.320
A given dispute comes, and
they step in with a magic wand

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.560
and fix it.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.670
And point of fact, very
good ombuds and those

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.790
in place for a long time
generally spend more than half

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.010
their time helping
people help themselves

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:21.550
to learn how to
deal with conflicts

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.990
and even to prevent them.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.330
And that's true for both
individuals and for groups.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.320
So helping people
help themselves,

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.170
listening to people
talk about their issues,

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.240
getting them to
articulate their concerns,

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:42.470
having more formal consultation
in organizations and forums

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:47.520
for affinity groups, and maybe
sometimes counsels of people

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.490
coming together.

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:51.270
These are all part of
a larger system that I

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:53.656
know you have emphasized.

00:05:53.656 --> 00:05:55.530
Do we have room for me
to tell a quick story?

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.390
Sure.

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:58.790
You know, I'm just looking
back at my old papers.

00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:03.880
In the 1970s and '80s,
I was young economist,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.690
and I came from
the outside to MIT.

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.850
I was overwhelmed
by having 100 people

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:13.070
come to me in my first
week, no two of them

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.400
with the same issue.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.670
And I didn't have any
expertise on any one of them.

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:21.500
But what I did do
with the total backing

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.770
of my boss, the president,
was to get any two people who

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.930
had the same issue together with
each other to try to figure out

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.350
what kind of systems change
might help deal with that issue

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.030
or even prevent it.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.020
Now here's what I
just discovered.

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.440
In those 17 years, there were
at least 60 women's groups alone

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:44.070
and many minority groups--

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.300
I haven't yet got a
perfect count of them--

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:49.690
and many cohort groups like
engineering assistance,

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.640
who got themselves together
to, as affinity groups,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.880
if you will, to
propose solutions.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.110
So that's just one example
of what you're seeing.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.340
Well, I like the emphasis
that you put on systems,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.370
that these different
options need to be there,

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.910
because people have
different preferences for how

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.150
they approach these issues.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.490
And you have been very
skillful in helping

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.740
people find something
they're comfortable with.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.920
And I think that's really
critical to making these work.

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.610
But you've also developed this
concept of micro-inequities.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.480
And we've heard about
microaggressions,

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.340
but you've kind of
turned that into ways

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.180
to deal with these
in positive ways.

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:34.150
What are micro-inequities?

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:37.690
And then we can talk about
how to perhaps deal with them.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.600
But this is something
that I think

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:46.110
is particularly unique
to your own work.

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.010
I was very honored
before and just

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:53.760
after I came to MIT to have as
a mentor Dr. Chester Pierce.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.830
Many people nowadays remember
him, a very prominent

00:07:57.830 --> 00:08:01.450
psychiatrist and a neurologist.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:06.090
Chet Pierce came up with
the idea of microaggressions

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:12.430
in 1970, talking about racism
and talking about hostile acts.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.150
And he was simply
extraordinary in helping

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:17.300
to develop that idea.

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.100
When I came to MIT, very
grateful to him for what

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.270
I had learned about
microaggressions.

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:28.550
I found microaggressions,
and of course we still do.

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:32.760
But I found a great
deal more besides.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.559
There are hostile acts,
as all of us know,

00:08:35.559 --> 00:08:38.330
and there's a great deal
of small acts of racism,

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:41.909
and religious intolerance,
and sexism, and so on.

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:47.420
In addition, I discovered a
lot of complaints and concerns

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.640
that appeared to me to arise
out of unconscious bias.

00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.770
That is to say, not
available to the person who

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:59.150
is behaving in a way that
he or she might even regret.

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.760
And in 1973, I found
myself doing this.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:07.060
And in fact, my kids were simply
delighted to catch me doing it.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.910
So unconscious bias
was a big deal for me,

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:13.700
and then I began to discover
these little aggressions

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:16.640
or inequities, if
you will, that seemed

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.700
to arise just out of negligence.

00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.870
I knew better, but
I just blew it.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.840
And then finally, there
was a large clump of them.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:28.990
Again, problems that
were problems for me

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:34.930
myself that arose out of what
I will call innocent ignorance.

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:37.740
A lot of ignorance
is not innocent.

00:09:37.740 --> 00:09:42.270
But I lived in West
Africa just before I came.

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:46.250
I inadvertently served
food with my left hand

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.440
to Muslim colleagues.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.290
I made the mistake of
showing the bottom of my foot

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:59.220
in a meeting, and in a very
polite Muslim meeting in West

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.290
Africa.

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:03.100
I learned that it's
very easy to be

00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.920
very offensive on
the basis of problems

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.090
that one just didn't know exist.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.490
So with great respect and
with Chet Pierce's blessing,

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.230
I extended the idea
of microaggressions

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:19.470
to include these other
huge groups of problems.

00:10:19.470 --> 00:10:22.890
Sexism as well as racism,
and just plain bullying,

00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.270
as well as either.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:24.770
Yeah.

00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:30.710
So these micro-inequities often
are happening even though we're

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:33.030
not always aware of them.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.840
But you've tried to make
this a more positive approach

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:39.670
to addressing these issues.

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.670
And you call them
micro-affirmations.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:43.200
Tell us what you mean by that.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.000
Give us some examples
of how one can deal

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.350
with these micro-inequities.

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:53.370
Again, it was partly in
an effort to make sure

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.400
that I was myself not
committing, if you will,

00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:00.750
micro-inequities right and left.

00:11:00.750 --> 00:11:02.790
And here was my problem, Tom.

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.110
I thought to myself, if
some of these problems

00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.680
come from unconscious
bias, and there's

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:11.400
no way we can be aware,
without a lot of work at least,

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.620
to be aware of our
own unconscious bias,

00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:17.410
what hope is there for me?

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.730
So I read and I thought.

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.810
Psychology gave me
a clue, which is

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:28.500
that if one always behaves
in a respectful way

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.460
and seeks out that
which can be affirmed

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:34.400
in everything around
one in one's work group,

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.220
always genuinely, of course,
things that really are going

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.190
well, if one's
whole life is spent

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:43.830
in genuine affirmation of
other people's excellence

00:11:43.830 --> 00:11:46.600
and in respectful
behavior, you can block

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:49.270
your own unconscious bias.

00:11:49.270 --> 00:11:52.680
So my first thought
about affirmations

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:56.900
was really in an effort to
do something about myself.

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.970
It turns out that
micro-affirmations

00:11:58.970 --> 00:12:01.950
have a whole lot of other
good aspects to them.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:03.590
They make people happy.

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:05.930
The work of the
negotiation project

00:12:05.930 --> 00:12:11.540
on core emotional concerns shows
that approval and affirmation

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:14.740
are two of the most important
core emotional concerns

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:17.720
that every single person
has all over the world.

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.460
And if I lived my life
in micro-affirmations,

00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:27.080
I am by definition reaching out
to the core emotional wishes

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.990
of everybody I'm
interacting with.

00:12:28.990 --> 00:12:30.920
And those are just two of the--

00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:32.800
you'll have a chart--

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:35.960
those are just two of the
ways that micro-affirmations

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.110
can be helpful.

00:12:37.110 --> 00:12:42.550
So by affirming good
behavior and recognizing it

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:45.860
and providing psychological
rewards and role

00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:49.860
modeling in your own
behavior, you often

00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:52.400
make it contagious for
others in one's work group,

00:12:52.400 --> 00:12:53.140
it sounds like.

00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.450
This is the way
in which you show

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.810
by creating an
environment of support

00:12:58.810 --> 00:13:01.920
that we aren't going
to tolerate inequities.

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.400
And you change attitudes
by changing behavior.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.690
Exactly so.

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:10.110
We've known for a long time
that attitudes affect behavior.

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.750
More recently, we've
learned that our behavior

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.000
can change our own attitudes.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:15.870
That's a big deal.

00:13:15.870 --> 00:13:17.880
I think that's a
really important point.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:23.790
And it has good
psychological research bases,

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:26.460
but it also just makes
good common sense

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.620
that we learn from each others'
experience at young ages

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:33.350
and in our workplaces as well.

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.170
So that's very helpful.

00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:37.590
But I want to turn
to another idea

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:40.620
that you have
championed and used

00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:43.230
so effectively over the
years, and that's something

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.760
that we call bystanders,
that you call bystanders

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.820
in particular.

00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.400
And we're all bystanders, and
we see bad things happening

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.390
in our workplace, in our--

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.420
wherever we are in society.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:00.140
And we come home, and the next
morning in the shower we say,

00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.770
gee, I wish I would
have done something.

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:04.840
Tell us what you've
learned about how

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:13.520
to be an effective
intervener when one sees them

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.150
in a bystander role
and sees something bad

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:18.720
happening at the workplace.

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.670
Bystanders have a bad
name all over the world.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.760
And in fact, the
term bystander effect

00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:25.360
is often used to
mean somebody who

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:31.260
stands by and lets racism or
unsafe behavior or something

00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.300
terrible happen.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.100
When I began looking
at all of this,

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:41.660
I began looking at it from the
point of view of an ombudsman

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.010
because where very bad
things or very good things

00:14:46.010 --> 00:14:50.460
happen in the workplace, usually
there's no supervisor there,

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.370
but there are peers
and bystanders.

00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:54.700
So I thought, here
is enormous leverage

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.970
either in getting wonderful
recognition for good behavior

00:14:57.970 --> 00:15:00.970
or in getting unacceptable
behavior stopped.

00:15:00.970 --> 00:15:04.220
So I began to study it.

00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:07.580
First of all, the bystander
effect, the so-called bystander

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:11.380
effect, it was studied
in a very narrow context.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.790
And even in that context,
it isn't always the case.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.990
But so what do
bystanders actually

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:20.630
do when they see something
unacceptable or scary?

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:22.550
It could be a safety problem.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.080
It could be a mistake.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.660
It could be an error.

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.940
Or it could be really
unacceptable personal behavior

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:31.390
or group behavior.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.740
Most bystanders
funnel very quickly

00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:36.720
through a great many options.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.100
And this is really the point
of where I'm coming to.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.840
Those who run organizations
usually think of bystanders

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:49.270
as either doing nothing
or reporting immediately

00:15:49.270 --> 00:15:51.060
to the authorities.

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:54.960
That meaning, responsible
bystanders do nothing,

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.310
or I guess they
don't do anything.

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:02.100
And if they're responsible,
they only report to authorities.

00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:04.920
In real life, bystanders do
all kinds of other things,

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:08.750
and I began to study that for
my last 15 years as an ombud.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:12.990
I collected everything that
people told me in my office

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.450
that they had
considered when they

00:16:15.450 --> 00:16:18.730
saw either wonderful behavior
or terrible behavior.

00:16:18.730 --> 00:16:21.030
What options did they consider?

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.750
And it's very rare
that they considered

00:16:23.750 --> 00:16:28.250
going to authorities, and
mostly they did want to act.

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:31.840
So they came up with lots
of other possible options

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:37.490
for how to get something fixed
or prevented or remediated.

00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:39.190
What would some of
those options be?

00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:42.860
Obviously, it means one
has to sort of disrupt

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:48.440
the behavior in real
time in some way,

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:50.130
or change the behavior.

00:16:50.130 --> 00:16:55.750
So can you give us an example
or examples of actions

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:59.537
that you've seen people take
that have been effective?

00:16:59.537 --> 00:17:01.370
Well, again, your
question is a perfect one.

00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:04.970
Because in real life, people
often don't act on the spot,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:05.730
in the moment.

00:17:08.217 --> 00:17:09.050
They think about it.

00:17:09.050 --> 00:17:11.130
And they might act on
the spot in the moment,

00:17:11.130 --> 00:17:14.260
but they think about it,
and they worry about it.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:17.720
This is the responsible
bystander again.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:19.390
Some of the options
they choose would

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:22.470
be to go home and talk
with trusted family,

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:25.510
or in the workplace with
trusted friends and peers.

00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:30.050
Or if they have a boss
that they really trust,

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:33.140
they might ask about
it hypothetically.

00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:35.930
Like, boss, if
something like this

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.280
were to happen, what
would you think about it?

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:44.050
What could the organization
do with a problem like this?

00:17:44.050 --> 00:17:45.740
Other possibilities
would be that they

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.340
would get a generic
approach to deal with it.

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:51.310
If it's an organization
that does a lot of training,

00:17:51.310 --> 00:17:54.695
maybe a training program that
can be brought in in which

00:17:54.695 --> 00:17:56.695
we just happen to mention
this kind of behavior.

00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:03.080
Sometimes a person will act, but
only together with a coworker.

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:09.130
So Tom, I'm thinking now, who
do I trust in my workplace?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:12.030
Who would come with me
to talk with a boss?

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:14.750
I wonder if I
could write a note.

00:18:14.750 --> 00:18:17.280
I wonder if there's
any manager who cares

00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.450
about this kind of behavior.

00:18:18.450 --> 00:18:20.450
Sometimes it might be
[? audit,  ?] for example,

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:22.850
or it might be the EEO office.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:24.860
Maybe I could write
a note and have

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.870
them think about
this kind of problem

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:31.210
in my section of
my organization.

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:34.010
So there are lots and
lots of different options

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.430
that responsible
bystanders will choose.

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:40.100
Well, I like the
way in which you

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:45.280
describe how you talk with
people to generate options

00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:46.240
like this.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:50.230
Maybe really skilled
people or people

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:53.620
who have a mindset can
interrupt behavior on the spot,

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.180
but often it's reflecting,
OK, what could I do tomorrow?

00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.240
What could I do
today in retrospect?

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.840
And it's finding those different
approaches that's so key.

00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.530
So if I'm hearing you right,
Mary, what you're saying

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:13.680
is organizations
really need to have

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:20.350
respected, independent neutrals
who are supported by a conflict

00:19:20.350 --> 00:19:23.310
management system
with multiple options,

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:25.860
because people have different
approaches to dealing

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.910
with workplace problems, and
they need different outlets

00:19:28.910 --> 00:19:30.480
for addressing them.

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:33.790
And then secondly, they need
to have tools and training

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.430
so that not only are
the professionals

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:40.470
good at addressing these
issues, but so are managers,

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:44.070
and so are frontline
employees, so that they

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:48.150
can be ready to put
these tools to use,

00:19:48.150 --> 00:19:50.230
and they have to
trust these tools.

00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:52.450
And then third, you
have to create a culture

00:19:52.450 --> 00:19:58.320
in the organization that
empowers people to take action

00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.200
to help themselves and
help others safely.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.630
So do you have
any final thoughts

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:08.410
on how we can put all
these tools to use

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:13.890
to deal with the modern problems
that we see in workplaces

00:20:13.890 --> 00:20:14.830
today?

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:16.090
I have two final thoughts.

00:20:16.090 --> 00:20:18.950
One is if you who
are listening to this

00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:21.850
is just an individual by
yourself, and maybe even young

00:20:21.850 --> 00:20:24.770
and you think you have
no power, you always

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:27.810
have options, just one
person, to make things

00:20:27.810 --> 00:20:29.420
better wherever you are.

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:33.180
If you who are listening
to this are a manager,

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.050
think about a systems approach
within your organization

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:43.000
to help other people to help
you with a strategic plan

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.090
to build an affirming workplace.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:47.730
Well, Mary, thank you very much.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.580
Thank you for all that you do
and all that you have done,

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:53.370
not only here in
our organization,

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.830
but around the
world to help others

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:59.030
build these kinds of
systems and capacity.

00:20:59.030 --> 00:21:01.954
And so there's lots
of issues to address,

00:21:01.954 --> 00:21:03.370
and we just have
to stick with it.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.560
So thank you very much.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:06.400
Thank you, Tom.

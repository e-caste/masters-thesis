00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.700
PROFESSOR: Bob has got a
really interesting history

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.195
I think is relevant to a lot
of things we're talking about.

00:00:31.195 --> 00:00:32.570
You're going to
hear a little bit

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.490
about disruptive
innovation, you're

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:36.773
going to hear about someone
that's spent a lot of time

00:00:36.773 --> 00:00:38.190
on renewable energy,
trying to get

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.910
new technology to
the marketplace,

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.620
and about kind of the
trials and tribulations.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.820
So I would encourage you to kind
of really ask lots of questions

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.816
and enjoy yourself.

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:52.495
Bob, thanks very much.

00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:54.620
BOB DIMATTEO: And you can
ask those questions right

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.287
from the beginning,
so I would encourage

00:00:56.287 --> 00:01:00.270
you to just raise your hand
anywhere along the way.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.620
So when I was your
age, I sort of

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:06.170
wondered about why there were
little kids in the world that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.820
didn't have clean
water to drink.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.700
And that sort of bothered me.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.640
And it was that kind
of thing really got

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.410
me interested in
engineering and got

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.690
me interested in clean energy.

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.970
And it's hard to imagine
like 30 years have

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.230
gone by since that happened.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.300
I mean, you guys aren't
even 30 years old.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.220
That seems like forever.

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.170
So I'll tell you about MTPV.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.570
This is a clean
energy technology

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:33.230
that our startup company is
developing to bring to market.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.190
And I'll also tell you something
about my own personal journey

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.660
in clean energy.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.690
And happy to take it
wherever you want to go.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.310
So maybe I'll do
a couple of slides

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.160
on sort of the technology,
and then you'll

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.150
know where I am at the moment,
and then how we got here,

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.590
and then we could go from there.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.560
So our technology
is called MTPV.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.990
It stands for Micron gap Thermal
PhotoVoltaics-- blah, blah,

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.490
blah.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.560
It draws on nanotechnology,
MEMS, and photonics.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.710
And what really motivates us
is that we think that it has

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:14.110
the potential to change
how we think about energy

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.680
because it's a way of
applying these very powerful

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.700
techniques-- the whole chip that
we see in our iPhones and we

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.530
see changing so many aspects
of our socio-technical life,

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.000
if you will--

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.830
bringing these kinds
of capabilities

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.020
to bear on the energy world.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.260
Which in some ways is, as you've
been learning in this course,

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.960
is in some ways, it's changed
a lot, and in some ways,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.780
it hasn't changed very
much in the last 100 years.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.080
We still make heat from things
that we get from the ground.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.870
And then we do things with
that heat, consume it as heat

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.420
or turn it into
electricity, et cetera.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.190
Our technology turns
heat into electricity.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.990
And so we start with
photovoltaic cells.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.240
You're all familiar with them.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.270
You see them on
buildings these days.

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.510
It wasn't that many years ago
when folks really didn't even

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.150
know what photovoltaic
panels were because you

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.000
didn't see them around.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.970
It's quite remarkable.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.000
In fact, when I was
just about getting

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.210
ready to finish undergraduate
work was just about the time

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.040
that President Reagan
took the solar panels

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.230
off the White House.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.380
Now they weren't
solar electric panels.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.780
They were just they were
just hot water panels.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.000
But clean energy wasn't--

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.973
it wasn't the primary
focus of too many folks

00:03:31.973 --> 00:03:32.890
at that point in time.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.970
MIT actually in that time
frame had a solar house, even.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.620
Sort of modern
architecture, lots

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.450
of glass solar house that later
came down about 15 years later.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.480
But now lots of things
are moving in that domain.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.300
So we start with a
photovoltaic cell.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.790
You're familiar with
the sun putting photons

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.850
on the semiconductor material
and making electricity.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:59.380
There's another field
called thermophotovoltaics,

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.160
or TPV, where we have an
intermediate body which

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.930
receives the heat--
the heat can come

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.860
from any conventional
sources or solar.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.260
And this body at--

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.980
right now, what we're doing is
around 1,000 degrees Celsius,

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.610
things start to glow red
around 600 degrees Celsius.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.070
So this is very hot.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.290
It radiates photons.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.330
It glows red.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:25.300
And those photons-- and
then converts electricity

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.190
by photovoltaic cells.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.590
So how many of you have
heard of Planck's law?

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.240
OK.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.150
So Planck's law was
sort of the foundation

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:47.460
of quantum mechanics in modern
science in the 20th century.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.560
And Planck's law
tells you how many

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.880
photons come off
a heated surface

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.620
and what wavelength they are.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.260
And so the photon
flux, the number

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.880
of photons coming off that
surface per square centimeter

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:06.990
is given by Planck's law.

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.190
And we represent that here--

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.990
1x Planck's law.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.790
And there were reasons
that we thought

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.290
that if you brought
that real close,

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.957
you could do near-field
coupling and you

00:05:14.957 --> 00:05:16.080
could exceed Planck's law.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.510
And it was somewhat
controversial in the beginning.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.370
In fact, in a meeting
with Hermann Haus,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.020
who was a real power house
in electrical engineering

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:32.610
and photonics-- unfortunately,
passed away a few years ago--

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.590
the first time we came
in his office with this,

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.180
he said, forget it.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.690
He said, there's just no
way to violate Planck's law.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:43.080
And about an hour
later, he realized

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.670
that we weren't
really violating it,

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.750
that we were operating outside
of the limits of applicability

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.960
that Planck himself
had put on the law.

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:56.160
Planck's law says
that the geometry

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.620
of all the pieces of the
system have to be large

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:59.850
compared to the wavelength.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.280
And one of the geometric
pieces of the system

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.240
is the space between
these two surfaces.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.810
So literally, the gap
between the hot surface

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.970
and the photovoltaic surface.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.280
In MTPV, Micron gap
Thermal PhotoVoltaics,

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.050
we put them really
close together,

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:21.660
like 100 nanometers apart,
or 1/10 of a micron.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.750
And when you do that, you
get near-field coupling

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:27.180
and the photon flux,
and therefore, the power

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.210
out can dramatically go up by
about an order of magnitude.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.940
And so he said, oh OK.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.400
He said, so you actually want
to put the photovoltaic cell

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.460
into the near-field or
evanescent field of this heated

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:38.960
surface.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.380
And we said, yes, exactly.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:41.400
He said, OK.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.570
Well, maybe you can do
better than Planck's law.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.020
And so really this is the field
that we've been pioneering,

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:55.200
using this mechanism which
basically derives from the fact

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.930
that inside the hot
body, there are photons

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.910
generated in every direction.

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:02.430
It's only the photons
generated inside that come up

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:03.720
to that surface--

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.300
normal to the surface or
nearly normal to the surface--

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.570
that actually get out.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.500
So in a hot body, most
of the photonic energy

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:14.430
that's being generated all
the time is trapped inside.

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.910
But if you bring a surface
up close enough to it,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.700
as those photons
approach the surface,

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.030
a photon is-- as Professor
Haus pointed out-- actually

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.928
has extent, it has
size of something

00:07:26.928 --> 00:07:28.220
on the order of the wavelength.

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.830
So we don't usually think
of photons as having a size.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:33.340
But they have an
approximate size,

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.590
something like the wavelength.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.100
The wavelength we're
working with is 2 microns.

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.493
The gap here is only 0.1 micron,
so this big 2-micron photon

00:07:42.493 --> 00:07:44.160
comes traveling up
towards that surface,

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:47.190
and just goes right across
this vacuum gap between the two

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:48.930
surfaces, act as a
photovoltaic cell,

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:50.830
and then can become power.

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.330
So it's all the photons that
are impinging upon the surface

00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:58.470
off-normal that get into
the photovoltaic cell

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:01.800
here, in our technology,
MTPV, that do not

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.320
get out of that hot body.

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.070
They're trapped inside
the hot body there.

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:07.590
And that's what causes
this increase in power.

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:14.620
So why do we bother doing that?

00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.600
We think that there are a number
of places of application--

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.450
I think, in the course, you
guys have contemplated--

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.780
or about to contemplate a number
of different sources of energy

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.820
as well as uses of energy--

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:32.260
so one of the application
domains is vehicles.

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.390
And we'll come back to
this slide at the end

00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:36.490
to discuss it in a
little more detail.

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.940
There's solar energy,
portable power, industrial,

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.480
which is the first one that
we're working on right now.

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.910
The other one not shown
is building power, a cogen

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.340
for a building like this.

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.720
So the first one is waste heat.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:54.010
There is lots of waste
heat in lots of places.

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:56.590
The focus right now
for our technology

00:08:56.590 --> 00:08:58.840
is industrial waste
heat, the kinds of things

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:03.910
that you see in these pictures,
specifically a glass plant.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.920
These are the basic modules.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.600
These are the chips of which you
saw a schematic a moment ago.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.630
So this is actually
a chip stack.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:17.290
Each one of these is a pair
of chips-- the hot chip

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.060
and then below it, the
cold photovoltaic chip.

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:22.420
So we build them into arrays.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:26.020
And then we take these
modules and we build those

00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:31.510
into arrays, like this, where
we have a housing on the outside

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:36.460
and then the chips go on
a mounting and control

00:09:36.460 --> 00:09:40.210
substructure, if you will,
which is mounted inside

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.070
of this hollow housing.

00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:46.750
So the hollow housing protects
from the outside combustion

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:49.900
gases, et cetera, allows the
heat to go through the surface

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.610
into the chips,
makes electricity.

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.690
And that's it.

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.650
It's a very modular technology.

00:09:56.650 --> 00:10:00.670
And that's one of
the promises of it,

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:06.550
that it can be deployed-- we
call it kind of noninvasive.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:10.480
And you've talked about
disruptive technology

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.540
some in the class,
which has become

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:17.620
an important understanding
in the business of bringing

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.660
all technology-- and not
even just technology,

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.310
but products to market.

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:24.190
And the idea of
disruptive technology

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:25.990
is the new technology
comes along

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.750
and it's not very
good, technically,

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:31.030
compared to sort of
the incumbents that

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:32.800
are on the market.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.880
But it finds a niche
where it can perform.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.880
Often the niche is
called noncompetition.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.460
So developing a product--
you look for a place

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:44.200
where there is no competition.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:46.390
And this is an
example of a place

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:48.550
where there is no computation.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.510
This sits outside a coal mine.

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:55.030
Coal mines nowadays, they go
down in the ground, and then

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.630
the coal-- and then the front,
the digging front, if you will,

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:00.610
the interface between
the air and the mine

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:02.320
and the coal that's
still on the ground,

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.350
it comes down and then
proceeds horizontally.

00:11:05.350 --> 00:11:10.130
And one of the issues
with coal mines, as--

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:12.242
is there anybody who
has not heard of a--

00:11:12.242 --> 00:11:13.700
let's see how do
we want to ask it?

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.653
Has anyone heard of a
coal mine explosion?

00:11:16.653 --> 00:11:17.320
Raise your hand.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:20.760
OK.

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.820
So most folks have heard
of coal mine explosion.

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.640
So why the coal mines explode?

00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.266
Any guesses?

00:11:29.266 --> 00:11:30.016
AUDIENCE: Methane.

00:11:32.872 --> 00:11:33.747
BOB DIMATTEO: Please?

00:11:33.747 --> 00:11:35.060
AUDIENCE: Trapped methane.

00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:35.852
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah.

00:11:35.852 --> 00:11:38.230
Trapped methane, exactly.

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:40.660
Whenever you're digging
up coal, you also

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.100
liberate trapped methane--

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.290
natural gas-- very explosive.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.660
And so they go through lots of
ways of controlling the methane

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:52.110
content in the air so that
the coal mine doesn't blow up.

00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:53.360
But they do blow up some time.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.570
And so what people have
started to do is drill down

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:57.250
in front of the coal mine--

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:59.800
there's this vertical face
that's coming horizontally

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.580
under the ground--

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:02.750
they drill down
into it like this

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.340
and they liberate the
methane in front of that.

00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:07.090
And then what do they
do with the methane?

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:09.590
Well, this is what they do with
methane, believe it or not--

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:10.360
oftentimes.

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.120
I mean, if it's big enough,
if it's stable enough,

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:16.870
then they will actually
feed it into a combined

00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:21.260
cycle or some type of combustion
system to make electricity.

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:23.890
But first of all, the
coal mine front is moving

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:27.400
and steam turbines
don't like to be moved.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.980
And so that's why you
see this very portable

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.710
looking infrastructure here,
that they actually move it

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:35.668
as the coal mine is moving.

00:12:35.668 --> 00:12:37.210
And what they need
to do is they just

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.650
need to destroy the methane.

00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.670
So here is methane being
destroyed in that inner pipe

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:43.870
there.

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.390
And the idea is to just
take panels like this,

00:12:46.390 --> 00:12:48.670
and to run them down
the middle of that tube

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:50.710
and to turn that
into electricity.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.950
And so no one's really
doing this right

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:55.780
now because of some
of the reasons cited.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.880
You could do it with--

00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:59.440
maybe we should
ask the question.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:03.850
So are some of you are familiar
with steam turbines, or?

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:04.510
OK.

00:13:04.510 --> 00:13:05.230
All right.

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:09.100
So you could imagine
putting condensers in here,

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:11.440
gathering steam, and
running steam turbines,

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.340
and making electricity.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:17.830
But the idea is if
you had a module--

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.502
sort of like a photovoltaic
module, but made out

00:13:20.502 --> 00:13:22.960
high-temperature materials that
you could put in it, easily

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.290
move, that would be preferable.

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:28.427
And the reason that
this is sitting here

00:13:28.427 --> 00:13:30.760
in this picture the way it
is because the steam turbines

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.050
are not feasible now.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:37.030
And so what we're going-- this
is an example of noncompetition

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:38.530
in the energy space--

00:13:38.530 --> 00:13:40.270
and clean energy
space in particular,

00:13:40.270 --> 00:13:43.540
because it would be a
way of making electricity

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:47.440
with zero net emissions
relative to the status quo.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.040
I mean, this is the status quo.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.830
So those emissions
are going out anyways.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:52.538
If some of the heat
can make electricity,

00:13:52.538 --> 00:13:55.180
that electricity's
zero net emissions.

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:59.470
So this is an example
of noncompetition.

00:13:59.470 --> 00:14:02.770
We go after that, we could
not compete against GE's gas

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:03.880
turbines right now.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.650
The performance of our units
are not good enough to do that.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.960
But they are good enough to
do this in the near term.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:14.920
And just as the original
integrated circuit chips,

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.170
when they first came out,
they didn't immediately

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:21.413
displace tubes.

00:14:21.413 --> 00:14:23.080
But they got better
and they got better.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.480
And I think Hiram talked
about the disruptive

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.540
example of the Sony radio.

00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.390
There were still tubes in
radios for some amount of time

00:14:31.390 --> 00:14:34.420
after those chips were in
those tiny little radios.

00:14:34.420 --> 00:14:37.720
And so you could kind of
view our chips as an analog

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:39.580
to those chips and
those transistors.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.585
And this is an application
to the transistor radio.

00:14:42.585 --> 00:14:43.960
They had the
transistor radio had

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.002
to be able to move into
kids' bedroom, et cetera.

00:14:46.002 --> 00:14:51.040
Here, it has to be able to move
with the front of a coal mine.

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:59.590
Another application similar is
combusting volatile organics

00:14:59.590 --> 00:15:02.060
as they're loaded
on and off of ships.

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:03.610
So in the back
here is a harbor--

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:05.313
this is down in Houston.

00:15:05.313 --> 00:15:06.730
In the very back,
you can actually

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.970
see a little tiny flare,
which basically a flame

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:13.210
sticking out of pipe, which
is the older way of doing

00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:15.730
these things in which people
have tried to eliminate

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:18.580
because flaring of--

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.540
flaring of natural gas
reduces the greenhouse impact

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.815
by about a factor of 20.

00:15:24.815 --> 00:15:26.440
So if you have natural
gas and you just

00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:30.190
vent it to the atmosphere,
and you compare that

00:15:30.190 --> 00:15:32.590
with burning the natural
gas before you vent it,

00:15:32.590 --> 00:15:36.250
you reduce this global warming
impact by a factor of 20

00:15:36.250 --> 00:15:37.720
by burning it.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.480
So in a way, flares
are a big advance

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.370
on just venting natural gas.

00:15:42.370 --> 00:15:45.140
But flares have their
own pollution issues.

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:46.900
And so what has
become prevalent,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:51.820
particularly in the most
developed countries at least,

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.350
are enclosed flares.

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:56.440
So this is a stack, basically.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.710
And it encloses a
flare like this flame.

00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:04.270
So as the ships are loaded
here, the volatile gases

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:07.418
that fill the tanks before the
liquid goes in gets pushed out

00:16:07.418 --> 00:16:09.460
and it has to go somewhere
so it doesn't explode.

00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:10.127
And where to go?

00:16:10.127 --> 00:16:12.010
It goes to this right here.

00:16:12.010 --> 00:16:15.400
It gets burned, and that
heat is just liberated.

00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:18.340
And so we are working
with a vendor that

00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.580
would put our panels
right across this tube,

00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:27.540
right in this flame to convert
that heat into electricity.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.170
So it's another example
of nonconsumption.

00:16:31.170 --> 00:16:33.590
I mean, these things are
running all the time.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:36.940
And that heat is not being used
because there's no good way

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.260
to do it right now.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.860
And this is just another
example of the same module

00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.670
that you saw.

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.620
Bigger panels-- this
is the kind of panel

00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:49.300
that might go into a
glass factory, which

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:50.570
is depicted here.

00:16:50.570 --> 00:16:55.090
So natural gas comes in here, it
burns, it melts sand, and lime,

00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:57.910
and things, which get
pushed into this big furnace

00:16:57.910 --> 00:16:59.110
with bulldozers--

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:00.940
literally, it's quite amazing.

00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:04.569
And they melt it and it
becomes like volcano lava,

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:06.310
sort of, in here--
it's actually glass.

00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:08.707
And then out the other
end, it slows down

00:17:08.707 --> 00:17:10.540
and becomes plate glass
like for the windows

00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.470
up there, et cetera.

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:14.710
And so this is the exhaust duct.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:20.020
The exhaust comes up here, and
right now, a type of furnace

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.490
called oxyfuel furnaces where
oxygen is taken out of the air

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.130
and put it to the furnace,
they create the heat.

00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.948
The heat just goes
up the stacks.

00:17:28.948 --> 00:17:31.490
Our panels would go in there
and convert that to electricity.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:38.440
That's actually the first
application that we have--

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.655
that we are working
on developing.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:47.430
So I'm thinking about
pausing at some point.

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:50.820
And I guess one question
is, how many of you

00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:53.284
are not electrical engineers?

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.610
OK.

00:17:56.610 --> 00:17:57.780
AUDIENCE: Lots of
chemicals and mechanics.

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:58.488
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:17:58.488 --> 00:18:01.950
How many of you are
not chemical engineers?

00:18:01.950 --> 00:18:02.450
OK.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:06.250
And how many of you are
not mechanical engineers?

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.800
How many of you are bio-folks?

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:11.200
OK.

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.490
All right.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:14.800
OK.

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.960
And I know we have some DUSP,
and some poli-sci folks,

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.110
and ocean engineer folks today.

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:24.850
So OK.

00:18:24.850 --> 00:18:27.280
So this right here
is an actual picture

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.650
of the same kind of furnace
that you saw-- actually,

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:30.787
the exhaust port of it.

00:18:30.787 --> 00:18:32.870
And this is the same kind
of housing that you saw.

00:18:32.870 --> 00:18:35.440
And this is some
initial testing that we

00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:39.850
were doing moving the panels
in and out of this facility.

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:42.700
This is an earlier version
before we came to this--

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.060
what we call product platform,
which is the basic architecture

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:49.899
that we've been
talking about to date.

00:18:49.899 --> 00:18:52.066
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Do you
want to say a little bit

00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:54.451
about the journey that got
you from an undergraduate

00:18:54.451 --> 00:18:55.888
interested in energy to this?

00:18:55.888 --> 00:18:56.680
BOB DIMATTEO: Sure.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.930
Yeah.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:00.530
I'd be happy to do that.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:03.110
Yep.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.920
I initially kind of got
interested in this kind

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:07.330
of market here.

00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:11.980
And how many of you think you
might someday start a company

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:13.465
or be part of
starting a company?

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.740
Wow, that's a lot.

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:23.040
That's more than-- well
more than half the class.

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:23.540
OK.

00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:24.748
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] energy.

00:19:26.848 --> 00:19:28.640
BOB DIMATTEO: So what
are some of the ideas

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.600
you're thinking
about, just to get

00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.100
a few examples on the table?

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.882
Samuel?

00:19:32.882 --> 00:19:35.533
AUDIENCE: Well, I think solar
thermal fuels could be cool.

00:19:35.533 --> 00:19:36.950
BOB DIMATTEO: Solar
thermal fuels.

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:37.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:40.700
BOB DIMATTEO: So building like
liquid or gaseous fuels out

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:41.960
of solar thermal energy?

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:43.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like
finding some molecule which

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:45.250
can like-- acts as
like a photoconverter

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:48.272
and take the sun's energy and
store it as chemical bonds.

00:19:48.272 --> 00:19:48.980
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:49.480
OK.

00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:51.200
Sort of artificial
photosynthesis?

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:51.932
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:19:51.932 --> 00:19:52.640
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.150
All right.

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.950
Cool.

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:56.210
Somebody else?

00:19:56.210 --> 00:19:59.630
A lot of hands went up
for starting companies,

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.369
including energy companies.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.180
Oh come on.

00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:07.690
Yes.

00:20:07.690 --> 00:20:08.515
Back there.

00:20:08.515 --> 00:20:09.650
AUDIENCE: Biotechnology.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:10.900
BOB DIMATTEO: Biotechnologies.

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.700
OK.

00:20:12.700 --> 00:20:16.697
Can you say, in the energy
context or different than that?

00:20:16.697 --> 00:20:18.280
AUDIENCE: Probably
not energy context.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.480
BOB DIMATTEO: In the energy--

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.526
AUDIENCE: No, probably not.

00:20:20.526 --> 00:20:21.651
BOB DIMATTEO: Probably not.

00:20:21.651 --> 00:20:22.490
OK.

00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:23.990
What realm?

00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.735
Medicine, or?

00:20:24.735 --> 00:20:25.360
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.000
Probably something to do with
medicine and pharmaceuticals.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.920
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.770
OK.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:31.390
OK.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.310
Someone else-- either
energy or not energy.

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:36.030
Let's see, who else
had their hands up?

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.790
Engineers are so engaging.

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:46.390
I love them.

00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:49.255
I spend my whole life with them.

00:20:49.255 --> 00:20:51.213
AUDIENCE: A lot of folks
defeat the stereotype.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.660
BOB DIMATTEO: So what else?

00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.118
Even if you're not
interested in it

00:20:57.118 --> 00:21:00.340
yourself, something you know
that somebody else might start?

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.330
Christopher, yes?

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:01.955
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:01.955 --> 00:21:08.252
A system for converting hydrogen
into ammonia for fertilizer.

00:21:08.252 --> 00:21:09.460
BOB DIMATTEO: Oh interesting.

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:11.460
AUDIENCE: Because like
I'm originally from Iowa,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.260
and most of the things we have
a lot of is water and wind.

00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:18.325
And wind energy electrolysis
to produce hydrogen,

00:21:18.325 --> 00:21:20.800
and using that to produce
ammonia because we also have

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.488
a lot of farms in the area.

00:21:23.488 --> 00:21:25.030
BOB DIMATTEO: So
then that fertilizer

00:21:25.030 --> 00:21:26.745
would go into the
food production then.

00:21:26.745 --> 00:21:27.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:21:27.370 --> 00:21:30.905
Because wind energy, a lot of
times where the windmills are

00:21:30.905 --> 00:21:33.070
is far away from where the
electricity is consumed

00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:34.905
and you lose a
lot to resistance.

00:21:34.905 --> 00:21:36.280
And so would be
economically more

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.110
efficient to produce
ammonia out of it.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:42.970
BOB DIMATTEO: That is
a really cool solution

00:21:42.970 --> 00:21:44.890
to having to ship--
build big grids

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:46.460
and ship the power all around.

00:21:46.460 --> 00:21:49.270
So there's wind in Iowa, and
there are farms in Iowa--

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:52.437
wow, that's neat.

00:21:52.437 --> 00:21:53.020
Somebody else?

00:21:56.890 --> 00:21:57.390
All right.

00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:58.110
Let's see.

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.300
So who has not--

00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.100
who is thinking--
who is not thinking

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:03.260
about starting a business?

00:22:08.463 --> 00:22:09.200
All right.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.200
So do you mind if I just
call on a couple of you

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.495
to say what you're
thinking about?

00:22:14.495 --> 00:22:14.995
Latifa?

00:22:18.252 --> 00:22:21.100
AUDIENCE: I have no idea.

00:22:21.100 --> 00:22:23.830
BOB DIMATTEO: But you think
you might start a business.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.122
AUDIENCE: I mean, maybe, if
the right idea comes along.

00:22:26.122 --> 00:22:28.900
I mean, [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.730
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:31.360
OK.

00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:32.170
Yeah, Scott?

00:22:32.170 --> 00:22:34.120
AUDIENCE: I think
for myself, and I'm

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:36.222
guessing for a lot of
people in the room,

00:22:36.222 --> 00:22:37.930
I want to start a
business at some point,

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:39.805
but I don't have any
good ideas yet, which is

00:22:39.805 --> 00:22:41.562
why I haven't pursued that yet.

00:22:41.562 --> 00:22:43.790
So I think that like
a lot of people at MIT

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:47.230
have the entrepreneurial
spirit, but just don't

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.742
have the good plans yet.

00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:49.450
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.160
That's important.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:51.910
Yes.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:52.675
First name?

00:22:52.675 --> 00:22:52.990
AUDIENCE: Sean.

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.782
BOB DIMATTEO: Sean?

00:22:53.782 --> 00:22:54.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.180
Well, for me, I think even if
I were to have a good idea,

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.620
I don't think I
would even venture

00:22:59.620 --> 00:23:02.590
into trying to start a company
at this point in my life.

00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:04.680
I think that there
is valuable insights

00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:07.990
I could gain by working
in industry for a while,

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:09.400
whether it's engineering or not.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.260
And as you get more
experience, you actually

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:13.510
understood how things
work in reality.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:17.470
Then at that point, the idea
that you thought it was good,

00:23:17.470 --> 00:23:19.132
maybe it wasn't.

00:23:19.132 --> 00:23:21.010
And if turns out
to be, then you'll

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:24.442
have more experience to
actually make it happen.

00:23:24.442 --> 00:23:25.900
BOB DIMATTEO: Makes
a lot of sense.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:26.420
AUDIENCE: It's not
about the idea.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.520
It's about the experience.

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:28.210
BOB DIMATTEO: Absolutely.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:28.710
Right.

00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.090
It's the idea and
everything else

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:35.080
it takes to turn that into a
product, doing something useful

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:37.850
for people in the real world.

00:23:37.850 --> 00:23:40.030
OK.

00:23:40.030 --> 00:23:46.090
One more input, just to have
a little collection of inputs.

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:49.570
One more-- anyone
want to jump in.

00:23:49.570 --> 00:23:51.760
Columbus?

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:53.110
You thinking about what--

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.200
what year are you in?

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.158
AUDIENCE: I'm a senior.

00:23:55.158 --> 00:23:56.581
BOB DIMATTEO: Senior.

00:23:56.581 --> 00:23:59.350
AUDIENCE: It's the intersection
of kind of the environment

00:23:59.350 --> 00:24:00.680
and energy sector.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:10.070
So how renewable impacts
on environment [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.420
energy system.

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.772
So I'm not really sure.

00:24:13.772 --> 00:24:14.480
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:15.020
OK.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:16.850
Good.

00:24:16.850 --> 00:24:21.080
So just based on the very little
you know about our technology,

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:26.030
make an argument for starting--

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:27.452
which one you would start in.

00:24:27.452 --> 00:24:29.660
Because one of the most
difficult things in launching

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:31.850
a business, whether you're
doing it as a startup

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:35.030
or whether you're doing it
in an existing large company,

00:24:35.030 --> 00:24:38.510
is what market to go
after first, right?

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:41.030
And there are advantages
and disadvantages

00:24:41.030 --> 00:24:42.387
to different markets.

00:24:42.387 --> 00:24:44.720
One of the advantages doing
something in a large company

00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:47.210
is you may be able to go
after more than one market

00:24:47.210 --> 00:24:48.260
at the same time.

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:52.010
But oftentimes, not.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.660
So it's sort of like
selecting a spouse, right?

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:02.840
There are lots of different
interesting candidates

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.850
in the world, right?

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:09.200
And how do you narrow it down
to one particular person?

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.160
It can be a painful process?

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:13.910
And so this can be a
painful process, too.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:17.150
So somebody say something
about why you would or wouldn't

00:25:17.150 --> 00:25:22.580
choose one of these four as
an initial launch market?

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.411
Yes, Samuel?

00:25:23.411 --> 00:25:25.494
AUDIENCE: I would say take
the one with the lowest

00:25:25.494 --> 00:25:26.160
barrier to entry.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:27.743
BOB DIMATTEO: Lowest
barrier to entry.

00:25:27.743 --> 00:25:30.380
So what do you mean
by barrier to entry?

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:32.860
AUDIENCE: Like thinking about
like what sort of things

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.610
are going to stand in
the way from getting

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:36.270
your product into actual use.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:38.770
And I mean like things where
there's a lot of infrastructure

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:42.100
to go through, or even like
really established industries,

00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:45.920
they can be kind of hesitant to
take on new technologies, where

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.900
things that are kind
of less established

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.780
oftentimes will be more
open to just changes.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.820
BOB DIMATTEO: So how
might you address that--

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.537
did you have, right here?

00:25:59.537 --> 00:26:00.370
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:26:00.370 --> 00:26:01.630
I did have something to say--

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:03.172
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah,
please, go ahead.

00:26:03.172 --> 00:26:04.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.480
Oh, I was going to say,
if I were to choose,

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.450
I'd go in more of a
[INAUDIBLE] because it

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.500
seems like the market is there.

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.832
And it seems like it's growing,
like not only [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:23.201
And I think that there'd
be more potentially.

00:26:23.201 --> 00:26:25.030
Like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:25.030 --> 00:26:28.640
But since solar's more,
I guess, uncertain,

00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.840
it's more uncertain
than like industrial,

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:36.490
like it seems like there's a
lot of [INAUDIBLE] happening

00:26:36.490 --> 00:26:37.720
in there right now.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.636
Automotive-- I guess that
would be my second choice

00:26:40.636 --> 00:26:42.422
if I had to choose right now.

00:26:42.422 --> 00:26:43.400
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.462
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:26:45.462 --> 00:26:46.670
These are really good inputs.

00:26:46.670 --> 00:26:47.767
Charlotte?

00:26:47.767 --> 00:26:49.850
AUDIENCE: I think I would
go with industrial, just

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.230
because a lot of--

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:54.423
I mean, for solar power
in like industrial areas.

00:26:54.423 --> 00:26:56.030
A lot of times
industrial plants are

00:26:56.030 --> 00:26:57.170
located like outside of
cities, where there wouldn't

00:26:57.170 --> 00:26:58.520
be as much like interference.

00:26:58.520 --> 00:26:59.660
And I think that--

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:02.420
I mean, obviously, like
industrial plants produce--

00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:05.040
like use a lot of
energy [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.022
generation, so that
seems like a market.

00:27:09.022 --> 00:27:09.730
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:27:09.730 --> 00:27:10.438
Very interesting.

00:27:10.438 --> 00:27:14.410
So we have low barriers
to entry, portable power,

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.480
industrial sector, right?

00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.170
Interesting.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:18.165
John-Mario.

00:27:18.165 --> 00:27:18.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:18.790 --> 00:27:20.520
So I think--

00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.050
I mean, all of those
four are pretty capital

00:27:23.050 --> 00:27:26.230
intensive as far as
starting something goes.

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:29.777
So I think scalability
will be a big factor.

00:27:29.777 --> 00:27:32.110
So that's one thing also
industrial is very interesting,

00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:36.490
because if you
look into a lot of,

00:27:36.490 --> 00:27:38.950
I guess, clean energy
initiatives tend

00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:42.610
to be very focused on
like the utility sector,

00:27:42.610 --> 00:27:44.990
how you can make things more
efficient-- or industry,

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.156
in terms of manufacturing.

00:27:47.156 --> 00:27:50.620
And I think personally,
there's too much

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.990
emphasis focused
entirely on just--

00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:55.800
for startups, just
in technology per se.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.030
But I don't personally
see that meaning,

00:27:58.030 --> 00:28:00.670
for example, consulting
firms advising

00:28:00.670 --> 00:28:03.070
how startups can secure
government grants,

00:28:03.070 --> 00:28:06.370
or how startups can position
themselves to take advantage

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:09.390
of existing policies related to
energy or something like that.

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:12.160
I think there are a
lot of different areas

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:16.510
that you can use
knowledge about energy

00:28:16.510 --> 00:28:19.135
and so on, but without
necessarily producing

00:28:19.135 --> 00:28:21.678
anything, mostly advising
for this as well.

00:28:21.678 --> 00:28:24.220
BOB DIMATTEO: So there's a lot
more than just the technology.

00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:24.887
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:28:24.887 --> 00:28:25.990
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.700
These are all really
important points.

00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:34.000
And as engineers, that may be
one of the hardest ones to get.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.800
It sounds like you
guys probably already

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:38.338
have a very good sense
of that, the ecosystem,

00:28:38.338 --> 00:28:40.130
that there's more than
just the technology.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.460
But oftentimes, the
technology is hard,

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:43.970
so it takes lots of your focus.

00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:50.190
But then you've got to make
all these other decisions.

00:28:50.190 --> 00:28:55.480
So in our case, we really
struggled with portable power

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.600
because it's small.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.590
And so compared to the
industrial, industrial,

00:29:02.590 --> 00:29:06.550
you need like more chips, which
requires more capital, more

00:29:06.550 --> 00:29:07.745
manufacturing capacity.

00:29:07.745 --> 00:29:09.370
You've got to deal
with bigger vendors,

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:11.450
and there's more bureaucracy
and everything else.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:17.420
And so the portable power
was very attractive to us.

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.590
We ended up going
with industrial, OK?

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:26.020
And so any guesses as to
why we might have done that?

00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.773
Yes?

00:29:27.773 --> 00:29:29.690
AUDIENCE: From what I've
seen, your technology

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.180
is most aligned with them.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:35.660
They have very
energy-intensive processes that

00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:38.860
are also capital intensive.

00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:42.612
And a 4% or 5% efficiency
gain, something

00:29:42.612 --> 00:29:44.320
that's valuable to
them in the long term.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.000
And they also have
a long lifecycle.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.790
It's not like a laptop that
has a two-year lifecycle maybe,

00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.215
you're not going
to get a return.

00:29:50.215 --> 00:29:53.050
So it's not 1,000 degrees.

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:58.250
And you have a much more diverse
[INAUDIBLE] whereas here you

00:29:58.250 --> 00:29:59.700
have maybe 20 major players.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.472
They all have
enormous plants that

00:30:02.472 --> 00:30:03.680
operate at high temperatures.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:07.790
I think you make the decision
to save 5% with your capital.

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:08.540
BOB DIMATTEO: Yep.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:11.780
So that was
definitely part of it.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:14.240
Performance-- how
good a performance?

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:17.480
You start with the
technology is just new.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.550
How good does the
performance of the technology

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:24.470
have to get before
you can do X market?

00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:29.570
And here, we felt that it was
more stringent because here--

00:30:29.570 --> 00:30:31.880
say, we're going to
go into a laptop.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.450
We had to compete
with the lithium

00:30:35.450 --> 00:30:38.270
ion batteries that
are in laptops.

00:30:38.270 --> 00:30:43.970
And so this kind of goes to
technical details, really.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:46.700
But that was a
factor, that we felt--

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:49.180
there's no way you guys could
know a priori sitting here.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.930
But we felt that it
would have been harder

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:52.763
to get that level of
performance, as opposed

00:30:52.763 --> 00:30:56.900
to the industrial
situation, where it just--

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:58.220
basically, it's economic.

00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:00.620
It needs to be
economically feasible.

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:03.000
But it doesn't have to
be any better than that.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.470
And there's really
no competition.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:10.940
Another thing was-- some of you
guys mentioned related things.

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:12.950
And that is, how
tightly do you have

00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:15.020
to integrate with
other companies,

00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:19.820
with other technologies,
with other applications?

00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:23.030
And we felt that
in the industrial--

00:31:23.030 --> 00:31:24.890
for example, the heat source.

00:31:24.890 --> 00:31:26.780
What kind of heat source
are we going to use?

00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.700
Where are we going to
actually get the heat?

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.790
Here, the heat would have
to be produced in a very

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:34.010
small combustion device--

00:31:34.010 --> 00:31:37.000
a pretty high-tech
combustion device.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.380
And so we would need
to very tightly couple

00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:44.390
with another company
to do that, as well

00:31:44.390 --> 00:31:49.490
that the heat rejection, safety,
FAA regulations, et cetera.

00:31:49.490 --> 00:31:53.790
Whereas in the industrial space,
the heat was already there.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:59.108
So it was just another
piece of complexity

00:31:59.108 --> 00:32:00.540
that we didn't
have to deal with.

00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:04.730
OK.

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:07.830
So let's see.

00:32:07.830 --> 00:32:11.682
Let me-- that's about
all I have for slides--

00:32:11.682 --> 00:32:13.640
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: How
about your life story?

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.598
BOB DIMATTEO: My life--

00:32:14.598 --> 00:32:16.098
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
How did you get

00:32:16.098 --> 00:32:18.020
from undergraduate
kind of interested

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:21.038
in this stuff to
selling to glassmakers?

00:32:21.038 --> 00:32:21.830
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah.

00:32:21.830 --> 00:32:24.247
So my life story-- so you
really want everybody to be able

00:32:24.247 --> 00:32:25.610
to take a nap right now--

00:32:25.610 --> 00:32:26.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Doesn't have

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.550
to cover all aspects
of your life.

00:32:27.550 --> 00:32:28.592
BOB DIMATTEO: No, I know.

00:32:28.592 --> 00:32:31.020
I'm just kidding.

00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:31.520
Yeah.

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.937
So I mentioned at the beginning
what kind of triggered it,

00:32:33.937 --> 00:32:35.450
right?

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:37.520
And I guess there
were two things-- then

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.730
there was an energy shock
in like the '70s, when

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:41.390
I was a kid.

00:32:41.390 --> 00:32:43.940
And then I was in
late '70s in college.

00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:46.000
And it looked like energy
was really important.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.480
So I guess you
guys are sort of--

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.160
the fact that you're
in this class--

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.590
the fact that this class
exists and the fact

00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.780
that you guys are
in this class means

00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:58.730
that energy has gotten a
lot more visibility now

00:32:58.730 --> 00:33:02.960
than it did, say, in the '80s.

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.920
So at any rate, I started--

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.830
what got me actually started
was an article in The Boston

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:14.540
Globe in 1978, in the summer.

00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:17.510
I was sitting down the
Cape, at my girlfriend,

00:33:17.510 --> 00:33:21.770
later wife-to-be's cottage,
reading The Boston Sunday

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:22.740
Globe on a Sunday.

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.860
And there was an article
that said, "Kid in Texas

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:28.340
Gets 100 Miles per Gallon
From '68 Ford Galaxie."

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:32.465
'68 Ford Galaxie was a big
car that probably got like--

00:33:32.465 --> 00:33:34.880
I don't know-- 8 miles
per gallon on a good day--

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.590
right-- 100 miles per gallon.

00:33:37.590 --> 00:33:40.170
So could that be true?

00:33:40.170 --> 00:33:42.260
So who thinks that
it could be true?

00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:50.130
Who thinks that it
could not be true?

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:53.080
And who's not sure?

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:53.580
Good.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:54.080
OK.

00:33:56.490 --> 00:33:58.130
I'm not sure.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:59.550
No, I mean, it
all depends on how

00:33:59.550 --> 00:34:01.920
you define the vehicle,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.750
There are only so many
BTUs in a gallon of gas.

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:08.760
At any rate-- so
it led me to the--

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:12.940
I was thinking about
medical school.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:13.960
I used to--

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.790
I studied at a school
down the street

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:19.510
at the other end of Mass Ave. So
I used to drive by this place.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:21.699
I have three graduate
degrees from this place now.

00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:27.730
But the way I really discovered
it was driving down Mass Ave. i

00:34:27.730 --> 00:34:29.350
mean, obviously,
I knew about MIT.

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:30.370
But I really didn't--

00:34:30.370 --> 00:34:32.826
I really didn't understand
what engineering was.

00:34:32.826 --> 00:34:35.409
I thought if you liked math, and
science, and stuff like that,

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:37.090
well, you could be
a doctor, you know?

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:39.007
So I figured, well, maybe
that's what I'll do.

00:34:39.007 --> 00:34:40.750
So I was a government
major because I

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:42.969
was interested in
the kinds of things

00:34:42.969 --> 00:34:45.050
that you talk about
in this course.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.290
But I really like
math and physics--

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:49.130
science and math.

00:34:49.130 --> 00:34:53.290
And so I figured,
well, I'll do medicine.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:55.120
And then I read this
article, you know?

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:57.220
And so then they kind
of came together,

00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:59.080
just like you guys are
doing in this class.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.050
You have technical
backgrounds of various sorts,

00:35:02.050 --> 00:35:04.840
and you're here learning
about the whole picture

00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.310
of energy, which really is--

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:09.370
I mean, in some ways,
unfortunately much bigger

00:35:09.370 --> 00:35:11.950
than just the
technology because it

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.420
makes it much more complicated.

00:35:13.420 --> 00:35:18.200
But in a way, that's what makes
it that much more important.

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:23.530
And so did early
experiments in this realm,

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:27.970
found out about solar
energy and photovoltaics.

00:35:27.970 --> 00:35:30.220
Came over here,
and Steve Senturia

00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.530
taught the class on
microfabrication,

00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.590
the interest in photovoltaics
brought me there.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:37.420
I ended up spending
a semester here

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.360
while I was an undergraduate
down the street, which,

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:43.870
if any of you are not seniors,
I highly recommend just

00:35:43.870 --> 00:35:46.300
get yourself down Mass
Ave, take just one course

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.620
at that other institution.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.770
It's totally free.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:50.400
It's totally easy.

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.210
It's a very different world and
you'll be glad that you did it.

00:35:55.210 --> 00:35:59.290
You can write me for
your money back if you

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.591
don't think so afterwards.

00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:04.030
At any rate, so I
started my first company

00:36:04.030 --> 00:36:05.980
while I was a senior
in college specifically

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:07.870
to develop energy technology.

00:36:07.870 --> 00:36:11.900
And it took probably 15 years
to really do it directly,

00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:13.450
which is this right here.

00:36:13.450 --> 00:36:15.320
Although, along the way--

00:36:15.320 --> 00:36:18.947
so from in the family garage,
tinkering with engines

00:36:18.947 --> 00:36:20.530
and trying to figure
out, can somebody

00:36:20.530 --> 00:36:26.770
really get 100 miles per
gallon, and patient family

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:29.210
kind of dealing with all that.

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:32.560
And then right then
in the beginning

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.527
of the '80s,
difficult recession,

00:36:34.527 --> 00:36:35.485
where do you get a job?

00:36:35.485 --> 00:36:37.068
Do you really want
to do clean energy?

00:36:37.068 --> 00:36:38.530
There are no clean energy jobs.

00:36:38.530 --> 00:36:40.720
And I went to work in
the aircraft industry

00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.060
because I also taken Fred
McGarry's course here

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.560
in composite materials
because I was

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:46.300
interested in composite
materials for what?

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:48.383
Why might you be interested
in composite materials

00:36:48.383 --> 00:36:51.220
if you're interested in energy?

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:52.390
Wait a minute.

00:36:52.390 --> 00:36:54.130
We got to get somebody
else, John-Mario.

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:55.480
Thank you.

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.080
Come on.

00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.478
Kristin?

00:36:57.478 --> 00:36:58.810
AUDIENCE: Lightweight vehicles?

00:36:58.810 --> 00:36:59.977
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:59.977 --> 00:37:00.610
Exactly.

00:37:00.610 --> 00:37:01.390
Right.

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.500
Exactly.

00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.090
Yeah.

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.210
And so they wanted to build
lightweight helicopters.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:12.265
And so later on, I
realized that I--

00:37:12.265 --> 00:37:14.140
wasn't so clear at the
time that I was really

00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:15.598
working on clean
energy-- you know,

00:37:15.598 --> 00:37:17.380
lightweight, strong
materials which

00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:22.150
are now going in lots of
airplanes and vehicles.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.980
And I thought I was in
the aircraft industry,

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.460
but I was really working--
pursuing my interest

00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:29.890
in clean energy.

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:34.000
And then another stint with
a company up the street,

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.660
MITRE Corporation, another
spin-out out of MIT--

00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:39.610
well, Lincoln Lab
spun out of MIT,

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:42.680
and MITRE spun out
of Lincoln Lab.

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:49.030
And when we started to explore
some of these concepts--

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.480
but I really wanted to try
to do things more directly

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:58.900
and linked with sort of
energy as the food piece

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:01.180
that Christopher mentioned.

00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.525
And sort of the notion
that if a home--

00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:10.080
if a home-- it's part of like--

00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.680
like what's an energy
system in a home?

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.140
I know this is real
easy, but what's

00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.550
an energy system in a home?

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:23.360
That every home in
the United States has?

00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.424
Yeah, Jacob?

00:38:24.424 --> 00:38:25.292
AUDIENCE: HVAC.

00:38:25.292 --> 00:38:26.160
BOB DIMATTEO: HVAC.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.030
Exactly.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:30.140
So make making heat, keep
people warm in the cold weather.

00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.697
And what's another energy
system in the home?

00:38:32.697 --> 00:38:33.638
AUDIENCE: An oven.

00:38:33.638 --> 00:38:34.430
BOB DIMATTEO: Oven.

00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.930
OK.

00:38:34.930 --> 00:38:36.430
And what might the
oven run off of?

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:38.080
AUDIENCE: Natural
gas or electricity.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:38.630
BOB DIMATTEO: Or electricity.

00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:39.130
OK.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.640
So then electricity is
another energy system.

00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:45.950
So one thought is, what if there
was a food system in a home

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:46.910
also--

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:49.470
going back to
Christopher's point.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:53.450
And so just the notion of
the home as being the energy

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:55.940
central of your
physical well-being--

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.150
whether it's in the developed
world or developing countries,

00:38:59.150 --> 00:39:02.120
even more important perhaps,
in developing countries.

00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:05.330
Any rate-- so it made me
want to build a house.

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:07.520
And I built a house while
I was working full-time

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.780
and then built another one.

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:12.710
And so then I did that
for about eight years.

00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:16.340
And we were leaders in
energy efficient housing--

00:39:16.340 --> 00:39:18.610
no surprise.

00:39:18.610 --> 00:39:21.500
And over the course of
time, we built some miles

00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:24.500
of roads and 150 homes.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:29.960
And then I went back
to graduate school

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:34.040
to more specifically
concentrate directly

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:36.860
on energy technology
and the kinds of issues

00:39:36.860 --> 00:39:39.600
that I talked about earlier.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:46.310
And that's what led to MTPV
with the professors here.

00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:49.130
And then there's a laboratory
across the street, Draper

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:50.360
Laboratory--

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:53.720
it used to be the MIT
Instrumentation Lab.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:59.680
And they called me up and
said, we saw your resume

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:02.850
in the course 6 resume book.

00:40:02.850 --> 00:40:05.570
And now this was and--

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:07.760
this is in 1996.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:11.240
And energy-- so how
important-- how hot

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:13.820
a topic was energy in 1996?

00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.950
Not for those of us that
were working in the field

00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:18.330
and dedicated, but I mean,
do you guys have any sense?

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:20.060
How old were you guys in 1996?

00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:21.640
Just a couple of
examples, ballpark?

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.013
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:40:22.013 --> 00:40:22.386
AUDIENCE: Four.

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:23.011
AUDIENCE: Five.

00:40:23.011 --> 00:40:24.350
BOB DIMATTEO: Six, seven, OK.

00:40:24.350 --> 00:40:28.040
So it wasn't on the top of
you guys' agenda, right?

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:30.710
But do you have a sense of
like how relevant it is today?

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:35.030
How much in the news it
is today versus in 1996?

00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:36.410
More now or less now?

00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:39.050
How many think it's
more now than then?

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:40.070
OK.

00:40:40.070 --> 00:40:40.850
Yeah.

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:44.772
So it certainly seems that way.

00:40:44.772 --> 00:40:46.760
But at any rate, there
were folks over there

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.810
that thought energy
would be important.

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:52.910
And so we started developing
this MTPV technology there.

00:40:52.910 --> 00:40:57.890
First analysis, the visit
the Professor Haus mentioned

00:40:57.890 --> 00:41:01.910
earlier here on campus, who once
he realized that you actually

00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:03.500
could do better
than Planck's law,

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.240
that we weren't
violating Planck's law,

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.400
that we were just operating
outside of the limits

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:11.280
that Planck himself put
on his law, he said, OK,

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.560
go run the numbers.

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:14.930
So go back and crank
through Maxwell's equations

00:41:14.930 --> 00:41:16.430
and do all that stuff.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:18.650
And come back and tell
me how much more--

00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:22.040
how much better can you
do that Planck's law?

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.770
And so with a tremendous team at
Draper Laboratory, many of whom

00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:31.470
we still work with
today, we did that.

00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.370
And then-- so this is part of--

00:41:34.370 --> 00:41:36.230
one of you guys here
mentioned starting

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.240
in a larger company, right?

00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:42.530
What's it look like starting an
energy technology in a startup

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:43.820
versus the larger company?

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:47.073
In the larger company, there
is management to deal with.

00:41:47.073 --> 00:41:48.740
Management does the
resource allocation.

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.090
And hopefully, which
was the case for us,

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.730
they ask good questions.

00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:55.370
First they said, go
convince Professor Haus

00:41:55.370 --> 00:41:56.720
that you have it all right.

00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:59.550
So when the analysis was
done, then they said, OK.

00:41:59.550 --> 00:42:01.940
Now you're ready to
design experiments, start

00:42:01.940 --> 00:42:03.260
doing the experiments.

00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:05.270
We built tiny
chips, 2 millimeters

00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:10.730
by 2 millimeters-- so smaller
than half your baby fingernail.

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:15.410
And sure enough, the effect
was there as the theory--

00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:17.075
as the analysis predicted.

00:42:17.075 --> 00:42:18.950
We published that in
Applied Physics Letters.

00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:21.270
The government got
interested-- somebody mentioned

00:42:21.270 --> 00:42:22.520
government funding or whatnot.

00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:25.340
That can be a very important
part of energy technology

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.960
because how is energy--

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.310
how is energy technology
different than, say, software?

00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:33.230
Than, say, iPhone app?

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:38.910
Obeida?

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.933
Do you want to take a shot?

00:42:40.933 --> 00:42:42.600
AUDIENCE: It's more
of you have to build

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:46.138
your products [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:46.138 --> 00:42:46.930
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:48.780
AUDIENCE: You need the materials
to build your products.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:49.572
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah.

00:42:49.572 --> 00:42:52.522
AUDIENCE: More capital
for startup [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:52.522 --> 00:42:53.597
from your own company.

00:42:53.597 --> 00:42:54.430
BOB DIMATTEO: Right.

00:42:54.430 --> 00:42:55.210
Exactly.

00:42:55.210 --> 00:42:55.930
Yeah.

00:42:55.930 --> 00:43:03.370
And so there was a recent book
written called Lean Startup.

00:43:03.370 --> 00:43:05.080
And so this-- the
following is basically

00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:07.690
a plug for the engineering
field, a plug for what

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:08.950
many of you were doing.

00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:11.470
So this book called
Lean Startup--

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:15.850
and the folks at HBS
and Sloan are very much

00:43:15.850 --> 00:43:18.100
aware of it, et cetera.

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:22.630
But it turns out that
it's been kind of a hit

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:28.210
and almost sort of a craze
in the innovation world.

00:43:28.210 --> 00:43:32.110
But he says in it
that he assumes

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:37.730
that what they're trying
to do can be done.

00:43:37.730 --> 00:43:40.865
So in other words, if you're
making an app for the iPhone,

00:43:40.865 --> 00:43:42.820
you know that you can
actually produce it.

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.060
It can actually do the thing.

00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.815
Do you do it this
way for this market?

00:43:45.815 --> 00:43:47.398
Do you do it this
way for this market?

00:43:47.398 --> 00:43:52.740
And that's where the war gets
lost or won in that world.

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.760
But here in energy,
it's really not that way

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:59.990
because there's no guarantee
that things can be done.

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.540
Like we've seen
billions of dollars

00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:05.120
go into the liquid
biofuels-- which one of you

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.430
guys mentioned-- recently.

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:11.570
And it's turned out that
it's very hard to do--

00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.130
very hard to do.

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:17.630
So it really it was a
technical impediment,

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:19.740
which is dramatically
different than, say,

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:22.070
if you're in the software
world, where you basically

00:44:22.070 --> 00:44:24.800
know that you can build
what you want to build.

00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:26.828
And so whether you're
think about starting

00:44:26.828 --> 00:44:28.370
your own businesses
or whether you're

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:31.790
interacting with management
in some big business,

00:44:31.790 --> 00:44:37.790
that understanding of
applying the right questions

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:39.152
know and the right rules--

00:44:39.152 --> 00:44:40.610
so if you're in an
energy business,

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:42.770
you probably want
the engineers to be

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:44.575
more involved in
management decisions

00:44:44.575 --> 00:44:46.700
than maybe if you were
doing software or something.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.620
What you really need
to know is, it's

00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:51.170
the marketing people
that need to drive--

00:44:51.170 --> 00:44:53.120
that need to drive the process.

00:44:56.645 --> 00:44:57.145
OK.

00:44:59.816 --> 00:45:01.630
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Questions?

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:04.360
Reactions?

00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.780
More about his life story?

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:08.140
BOB DIMATTEO: So
we-- just to finish,

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.500
we developed this
for about six years--

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:11.000
excuse me.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.690
We developed this for
10 years at Draper Lab,

00:45:13.690 --> 00:45:14.915
literally across the street.

00:45:14.915 --> 00:45:16.540
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Government funded?

00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:19.900
BOB DIMATTEO: It was about half
internal and half government.

00:45:19.900 --> 00:45:23.500
And from starting with just
an idea, like you guys have

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.010
mentioned some ideas,
and then analysis,

00:45:26.010 --> 00:45:27.760
and quickly moving on
to actually building

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.177
hardware-- tiny
hardware with just

00:45:29.177 --> 00:45:34.240
scientific proof of concept
demonstration hardware.

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:37.210
And then scaling up to the
kinds of panels and modules

00:45:37.210 --> 00:45:40.420
that you see us working on now.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.120
The last five
years of that work,

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:48.160
I went on in the startup,
MTPV Corporation,

00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:52.600
which got spun out of Draper.

00:45:52.600 --> 00:45:55.210
I came back here for a
year as a Sloan Fellow--

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:57.130
plug for the Sloan
Fellows program.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:00.880
And actually, the first couple
of million dollars, roughly,

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.110
invested in our company was
from fellow Sloan Fellows,

00:46:05.110 --> 00:46:06.658
which was pretty remarkable.

00:46:06.658 --> 00:46:08.200
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Draper Labs also

00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:09.580
have-- do they have that IP?

00:46:09.580 --> 00:46:09.970
BOB DIMATTEO: Yes.

00:46:09.970 --> 00:46:10.470
Yes.

00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:11.860
Draper Labs involved as well.

00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:13.902
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And
did they give you the IP

00:46:13.902 --> 00:46:15.490
or do they have the IP?

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:18.670
BOB DIMATTEO: I actually
had the IP here.

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:21.320
And so it went with me
to there and then beyond.

00:46:21.320 --> 00:46:23.200
That was kind of part
of the original--

00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:27.430
another important person at MIT
whose name is Robert Rines--

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:29.920
none of you probably had the
pleasure of taking his course.

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:32.150
He kind of taught one of the--

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:34.570
the first course probably
for engineers in innovation.

00:46:34.570 --> 00:46:36.610
Now all you guys know
about entrepreneurship

00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:37.840
and innovation.

00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:41.020
Some of you are smart enough to
realize that entrepreneurship

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:45.010
and innovation isn't right
for everybody at every moment,

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:47.932
and it can be very
painful along the way.

00:46:47.932 --> 00:46:50.140
And I'm happy to talk about
some of that if you want.

00:46:50.140 --> 00:46:52.060
And if you were smart, you
would ask me about some of that

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:54.060
if you want, especially
the half of you thinking

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.380
about starting businesses.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:59.800
And but anyway, Robert Rines--

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:00.963
so he taught a course--

00:47:00.963 --> 00:47:02.380
it was taught out
of course 6, I'm

00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:05.590
not sure why for starting
like 50 years ago

00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:07.750
in innovation and patents.

00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:10.050
And I took that course.

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:13.570
And he became our patent
attorney for MTPV Corporation

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:17.540
until he passed away
a couple of years ago.

00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:22.600
So MIT is really all
over this technology.

00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.690
And I guess--

00:47:27.690 --> 00:47:29.440
Hiram said, you know,
you should tell them

00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:31.990
that you think that you
guys have the potential

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.600
to get to 60%
efficiency and like

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:36.728
a megawatt per square meter.

00:47:36.728 --> 00:47:38.770
And I hate talking about
those things-- it really

00:47:38.770 --> 00:47:40.390
is what keeps us going.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:42.730
I mean, these initial
niche markets,

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:44.140
they don't keep you going.

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:47.440
They keep you
focused so you know

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:50.000
what you need to do when
you get up every day.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.250
But they don't keep you going.

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:53.710
What keeps you going is a
larger vision about something

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:56.950
that-- it doesn't have to
be as large as producing

00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:58.780
50% of the world's energy.

00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:01.810
But it's a larger vision as
to how what you're working on

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:03.683
creates meaning.

00:48:03.683 --> 00:48:06.100
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: One of
the things I hear you saying--

00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:08.640
I hear in your
narrative and that I

00:48:08.640 --> 00:48:10.640
hear from a lot of
entrepreneurs-- and, in fact,

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:13.930
a lot of people, but a lot of
entrepreneurs in particular

00:48:13.930 --> 00:48:17.010
is your path has not
been a straight line.

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:18.010
BOB DIMATTEO: Certainly.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.135
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And
if you sort of sit there--

00:48:20.135 --> 00:48:22.070
sit out there and think,
I'm going to do this,

00:48:22.070 --> 00:48:23.550
then I'm going to do this,
then I'm going to do that,

00:48:23.550 --> 00:48:24.880
then I'm going to do that--

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.500
it sort of worked
for Bill Gates,

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.435
but it doesn't work very often.

00:48:28.435 --> 00:48:29.560
It doesn't work very often.

00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:29.650
BOB DIMATTEO: Right.

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:31.010
And not in the energy
field, it seems.

00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:32.020
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:48:32.020 --> 00:48:33.437
BOB DIMATTEO: Is
it possible there

00:48:33.437 --> 00:48:36.100
are some fields where it does
sort of go more linearly?

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:40.400
Like I don't know, maybe
biotech and drug discovery

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:41.400
and something like that?

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:41.920
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Oh, no.

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.260
BOB DIMATTEO: No?

00:48:42.260 --> 00:48:43.660
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: But I
mean for individual careers.

00:48:43.660 --> 00:48:44.480
BOB DIMATTEO: For
individual careers, OK.

00:48:44.480 --> 00:48:45.250
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Individual careers,

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.800
if you're going to be an
entrepreneur, a lot of people--

00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:49.450
I was with this
startup and it failed,

00:48:49.450 --> 00:48:50.800
and I worked with this company.

00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:53.830
And then I did this, and then
three of us had this idea.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:57.350
And you don't sit here
at 20, 21 years of age

00:48:57.350 --> 00:48:58.565
and you see that path.

00:48:58.565 --> 00:48:59.357
BOB DIMATTEO: True.

00:48:59.357 --> 00:48:59.470
Yeah.

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:01.440
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: The path
opens up in front of you.

00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:02.330
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah.

00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.510
Oftentimes true.

00:49:03.510 --> 00:49:06.490
And it's why there's a
lot of merit in starting

00:49:06.490 --> 00:49:09.550
a career in existing companies.

00:49:09.550 --> 00:49:11.680
Because as the young
man pointed out,

00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.200
you do get lots of
experience and knowledge

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:18.330
that addresses those kinds of
dilemmas and risk, et cetera.

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:19.740
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Questions?

00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:21.276
You want to hear about the pain?

00:49:21.276 --> 00:49:23.670
Ready to hear about the pain?

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:24.670
Give them a little pain.

00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:26.560
BOB DIMATTEO: Well,
I'll invite my wife in

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.530
to give you the pain, right?

00:49:30.530 --> 00:49:31.030
Yeah.

00:49:31.030 --> 00:49:35.170
So when you're with startups
and you're getting them funded,

00:49:35.170 --> 00:49:37.120
that can be challenging, right?

00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:41.200
So have any of you
funded anything to date?

00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:45.010
You know, even like lawnmower
business when you were a kid,

00:49:45.010 --> 00:49:46.450
you bought the lawnmower?

00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:49.286
Yes, over there.

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:51.478
AUDIENCE: Like raise
funding for something?

00:49:51.478 --> 00:49:52.270
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah.

00:49:52.270 --> 00:49:53.096
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:49:53.096 --> 00:49:55.576
I'm doing a project
this summer in Africa.

00:49:55.576 --> 00:49:58.552
And we have to raise a little
less than a thousand dollars

00:49:58.552 --> 00:50:00.040
to join the project.

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.975
So that's an initiative
from the companies

00:50:02.975 --> 00:50:05.838
to sponsor us themselves.

00:50:05.838 --> 00:50:06.630
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah.

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.935
So where are you
in that process?

00:50:08.935 --> 00:50:09.825
AUDIENCE: Excuse me?

00:50:09.825 --> 00:50:10.520
Where are we?

00:50:10.520 --> 00:50:10.830
BOB DIMATTEO: Yeah.

00:50:10.830 --> 00:50:12.120
In the fundraising process.

00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.110
Money's in the bank?

00:50:13.110 --> 00:50:13.650
Talking to--

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:14.275
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:14.275 --> 00:50:16.635
we're just-- we
recently [INAUDIBLE]..

00:50:16.635 --> 00:50:17.885
BOB DIMATTEO: Congratulations.

00:50:17.885 --> 00:50:18.830
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Nice.

00:50:18.830 --> 00:50:19.860
BOB DIMATTEO: That's
a real big deal.

00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:20.300
Yeah.

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:21.760
And what are you
doing in your Africa?

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:22.310
AUDIENCE: Will you be
able to transfer it,

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:24.020
are you actually
going to transfer it?

00:50:24.020 --> 00:50:25.490
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:25.490 --> 00:50:28.522
AUDIENCE: I'm hoping
we'll see something soon.

00:50:28.522 --> 00:50:29.230
BOB DIMATTEO: OK.

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:30.438
AUDIENCE: You will, I'm sure.

00:50:30.438 --> 00:50:34.170
BOB DIMATTEO: Well, that's
an important point to be at.

00:50:34.170 --> 00:50:37.160
The final little legal
details, and the little words

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:39.482
and everything else,
that can take a while.

00:50:39.482 --> 00:50:41.690
It can take a while for the
money to actually show up

00:50:41.690 --> 00:50:42.385
in the bank.

00:50:42.385 --> 00:50:44.510
So you can't count on it
until it's actually there.

00:50:44.510 --> 00:50:45.950
But sounds like you
guys are very close.

00:50:45.950 --> 00:50:46.617
Congratulations.

00:50:46.617 --> 00:50:48.120
What are you doing?

00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:50.330
AUDIENCE: Well, we're
launching a robotics league.

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:51.740
BOB DIMATTEO: Robotics league?

00:50:51.740 --> 00:50:52.610
In which country?

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:53.360
AUDIENCE: Nigeria.

00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.277
BOB DIMATTEO: Nigeria.

00:50:54.277 --> 00:50:54.920
Very cool.

00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.300
Wow.

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:58.250
Was there another hand?

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:00.110
Yes?

00:51:00.110 --> 00:51:03.380
AUDIENCE: I raised funds
for a high-school business

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:04.350
that I started.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:04.525
BOB DIMATTEO: Really

00:51:04.525 --> 00:51:05.390
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:08.600
Is was basically just selling
greeting cards to corporations.

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:12.320
And we raised money
by allowing people

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:14.670
to buy shares in the
company because we

00:51:14.670 --> 00:51:16.990
decided to liquidate it
at the end of the year,

00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:18.470
so we raised $600.

00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:19.470
BOB DIMATTEO: Excellent.

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:21.880
AUDIENCE: That
was all we needed.

00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:24.260
BOB DIMATTEO: OK, so you get
two real entrepreneurs here.

00:51:24.260 --> 00:51:26.202
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Asking people for money

00:51:26.202 --> 00:51:27.410
is an interesting experience.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:28.350
BOB DIMATTEO: Absolutely.

00:51:28.350 --> 00:51:28.850
Yeah.

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:29.890
Absolutely.

00:51:29.890 --> 00:51:30.890
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:51:30.890 --> 00:51:31.900
Any other questions?

00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:33.983
I did promise you
sort of a half an hour

00:51:33.983 --> 00:51:36.150
or something completely
different, so we'll do that.

00:51:36.150 --> 00:51:36.945
Thank you.

00:51:36.945 --> 00:51:37.240
BOB DIMATTEO: Great.

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:37.740
Thank you.

00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:40.390
[APPLAUSE]

00:51:40.390 --> 00:51:42.370
Thank you all.

00:51:42.370 --> 00:51:43.990
Pleasure speaking with you.

00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:46.900
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So to compromise

00:51:46.900 --> 00:51:48.880
between those who wanted
that talk and those

00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.890
who wanted this
talk, I'll give you

00:51:50.890 --> 00:51:53.200
a little bit of what
I would have tried

00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:55.480
to make an hour and
a half out of if you

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:58.600
had voted for economic
development and green growth.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:04.810
This story starts in '87
with the Brundtland Report,

00:52:04.810 --> 00:52:08.200
a Commission chaired by
Gro Harlem Brundtland,

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.410
a woman who was a former
prime minister of Norway, that

00:52:11.410 --> 00:52:13.690
coined the phrase
sustainable development

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:16.870
and gave it the definition
that you see there.

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:21.010
And in that first small bullet
is sort of the economist's

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:22.160
interpretation.

00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:25.160
And that is the economy has
a certain set of assets,

00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:27.430
intellectual capital,
and physical capital,

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:33.220
and the environment, and the
natural world, a set of stocks.

00:52:33.220 --> 00:52:36.340
And the notion is
you should pass on

00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:38.890
to be sustainable
a set of stocks

00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:42.610
that are as desirable as
the set you inherited.

00:52:42.610 --> 00:52:45.040
The first President Bush
called that stewardship.

00:52:45.040 --> 00:52:47.950
Since he was a Republican,
nobody used that term.

00:52:47.950 --> 00:52:51.700
But that's the concept, that you
have a certain set of assets.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.330
So you could say, for instance,
that economic development

00:52:55.330 --> 00:52:59.860
in 19th century Britain was
arguably sustainable, right?

00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:03.880
They burned all the coal, the
country was dirty as anything

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:06.370
for decades, but
they came out of it

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.070
with tangible capital,
intellectual capital,

00:53:09.070 --> 00:53:13.450
a whole set of other assets that
provided standard of living.

00:53:13.450 --> 00:53:19.340
Saudi Arabia is mostly spending
the oil money on consumption.

00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:20.920
So when the oil goes--

00:53:20.920 --> 00:53:24.640
British coal is long
gone, but Britain used it.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:28.120
And the issue is that when
the Saudi oil is gone,

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.990
that generation is not
going to have the assets.

00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:33.430
Now it's a little vague, right?

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:36.670
It doesn't distinguish
between intellectual capital

00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:38.530
and species.

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:42.220
And it doesn't say
anything about poverty.

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:46.750
And this question of the
future generations' own needs--

00:53:46.750 --> 00:53:49.750
I mean, if the future generation
wants to only play video games,

00:53:49.750 --> 00:53:52.490
then wiping out the
elephants won't matter.

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:53.950
But if future
generations actually

00:53:53.950 --> 00:53:56.530
care a lot about
the natural world,

00:53:56.530 --> 00:53:59.480
then having great video
games is not very important.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:03.040
So if you don't know what their
needs are, it's a little tough.

00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.410
And you know I was once
interviewed and asked

00:54:05.410 --> 00:54:07.840
what I thought sustainable
development meant,

00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.990
and I gave the
Brundtland definition.

00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:11.590
And they said, is
that all, you mean?

00:54:11.590 --> 00:54:12.692
That's kind of narrow.

00:54:12.692 --> 00:54:13.900
And I said, what do you mean?

00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:15.817
They said, what about
sustainable communities,

00:54:15.817 --> 00:54:17.920
and sustainable lifestyles,
and sustainable--

00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.020
it's gotten to mean sort
of everything that's good

00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:21.400
and wholesome and green--

00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:22.330
and a little vague.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:26.350
But nonetheless, start with the
sustainable development notion.

00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:30.280
The next big event was
the 1992 Conference

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.200
on Environment and Development.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:36.130
This was the conference that
led to the Framework Convention

00:54:36.130 --> 00:54:38.770
on Climate Change
and really started

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:41.740
that conversation-- the Kyoto
Protocol and all of that.

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:43.570
That was a big deal.

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:46.130
172 governments participated.

00:54:46.130 --> 00:54:50.260
108 heads of state or
heads of government went.

00:54:50.260 --> 00:54:51.170
That's huge.

00:54:51.170 --> 00:54:53.440
And what came out of
it was a lot of paper.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.510
But the Framework Convention
on Climate Change,

00:54:55.510 --> 00:54:59.650
which really structured
all the subsequent debate.

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:03.040
So now we come to
20 years later.

00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.930
And you've got this
whole UN machinery.

00:55:05.930 --> 00:55:09.520
And we ought to have
a conference Rio+20.

00:55:09.520 --> 00:55:13.750
Well, if the headline
was climate in 1992,

00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:16.840
the question is, what's
the headline now?

00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:20.230
And that leads to the green
growth discussion, right?

00:55:20.230 --> 00:55:23.390
So you began to get--

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:25.450
beginning a few
years ago, you began

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:28.480
to see staff papers
emerging talking

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:31.300
about the green economy,
and green development,

00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:33.760
and green growth.

00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:36.910
Now I have to say,
I've read a lot of this

00:55:36.910 --> 00:55:39.940
and the definition is
not entirely clear.

00:55:39.940 --> 00:55:45.130
It is described as a subset
of sustainable development.

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:48.700
And it seems to be that subset
of sustainable development

00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:52.540
strategies that doesn't
involve degradation

00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:55.750
of the natural
environment on the way.

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:59.260
So the British
development wouldn't be--

00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:03.460
might be sustainable because
at the end of all that dirt,

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.100
they had high living standards
and the prospect of higher

00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:10.720
living standards, but not green,
because the environment was

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:12.520
degraded rather substantially.

00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.620
It recovered, but it was
degraded substantially

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:18.280
in the process, and I'm sure
species were extinguished.

00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.430
So maybe you could do
fossil fuels and be green.

00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:23.980
I think so.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.590
But if you think about
alternative ways of doing

00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:30.340
sustainable development,
there's another--

00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:34.030
another part of the World Bank--

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:36.490
the World Bank, the UN,
the OECD, and others

00:56:36.490 --> 00:56:37.990
are talking about green economy.

00:56:37.990 --> 00:56:40.870
If you go on the World Bank
website and you look carefully,

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:44.410
you see papers on
inclusive growth.

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:47.560
And that says, well, you
have to be sustainable,

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:51.100
but you should focus on poverty.

00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:53.710
Green growth says, you
ought to be sustainable

00:56:53.710 --> 00:56:57.095
but you should focus
on the environment.

00:56:57.095 --> 00:56:57.595
OK.

00:57:00.650 --> 00:57:01.860
Where do you go from there?

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:07.490
Well, this is what is sort
of the interesting thing.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:10.250
Particularly the UN
now argues that if you

00:57:10.250 --> 00:57:15.080
make very large
investments in going green,

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.470
growth of living
standards will increase.

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:22.800
The phrase that's used is,
"a new engine of growth."

00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.100
Now if you're a
cynical economist,

00:57:25.100 --> 00:57:27.800
you realize that
not only does that

00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:32.730
mean there's a free lunch, but
one we'd all be paid to eat,

00:57:32.730 --> 00:57:33.230
right?

00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:35.660
Going green will
raise living standards

00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:38.670
after a very short
period of time.

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:43.340
So what I want to do is talk
a little bit about that.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:47.780
You can imagine how I
and others got engaged.

00:57:47.780 --> 00:57:50.630
This was sort of very--

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:55.490
if you don't know this world,
the World Bank and the OECD

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:58.700
and the UN have a lot of--

00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:00.350
not to insult
anybody, but they have

00:58:00.350 --> 00:58:03.650
a lot of very smart
people without much to do.

00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:07.490
So a lot of papers
generated, and mostly, people

00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:09.140
pay little attention to it.

00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:13.670
But suddenly-- and I'll get
into specifics-- suddenly,

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:16.820
you have these organizations
revving up for a big world

00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:19.070
conference talking about--

00:58:19.070 --> 00:58:23.780
talking about massive changes
in investment strategy.

00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:27.000
And I'll give you a sense of it.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.300
So economists have begun
to write about this.

00:58:29.300 --> 00:58:32.420
What's on the reading list--

00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:37.520
What's on Stellar is a
couple of the shorter

00:58:37.520 --> 00:58:39.140
I think World Bank and--

00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.950
I don't remember whether it's
UN or OECD publications--

00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:47.260
piece of mine commenting on
this whole thing that's--

00:58:47.260 --> 00:58:49.360
it'll be the introduction
to a special issue

00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.940
of Energy Economics.

00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:55.210
And then some other papers
that I want to talk about,

00:58:55.210 --> 00:58:57.550
about some of the issues.

00:58:57.550 --> 00:59:01.610
So let me talk about just
some of the issues here.

00:59:01.610 --> 00:59:05.980
One issue that everybody
points out is absolutely right.

00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:09.160
GDP doesn't pick this up.

00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:14.545
GDP-- we talk about stocks and
flows, you have family silver,

00:59:14.545 --> 00:59:16.420
you sell the family
silver, you have a party,

00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.050
the party shows up in GDP.

00:59:19.050 --> 00:59:21.660
The fact that somehow the
silver's out of your hands--

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:25.170
or it shows up in sort of
your consumption, certainly.

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:26.308
If you burn down--

00:59:26.308 --> 00:59:28.350
and there are plenty of
African countries, plenty

00:59:28.350 --> 00:59:30.750
of other countries, that
have basically burned down--

00:59:30.750 --> 00:59:32.460
New Hampshire did
it, Vermont did it--

00:59:32.460 --> 00:59:35.640
you burn down the forest to
fuel economic development.

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.970
There's a sense in which you're
changing one asset to another.

00:59:38.970 --> 00:59:41.700
Certainly, just looking
at what gets produced

00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:43.810
understates the cost.

00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:48.660
So if you look at net
national product which

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:51.480
gets depreciation
of some assets,

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.480
it subtracts from
gross national product.

00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.560
It picks up some of
this, but properly

00:59:58.560 --> 01:00:02.100
measured, you'd want to take
into account the fact that what

01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:04.740
happened in 19th century
Britain was they paid

01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:09.120
for economic development in part
by trashing the environment,

01:00:09.120 --> 01:00:12.480
in part by killing
people with the health

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.900
effects of all that
smoke, and degrading

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:16.900
the natural environment.

01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:19.150
So you'd want to take that
into account when you said,

01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:21.960
what's income, what are
living standards, really?

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.910
We don't know how to do that.

01:00:23.910 --> 01:00:26.640
There's work at the UN,
there's work at the US.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.850
But part of the
green growth argument

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:34.260
could be that what
you want to measure

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:38.310
isn't GDP growth, but growth
in living standards, taking

01:00:38.310 --> 01:00:40.567
into account all
this other stuff,

01:00:40.567 --> 01:00:42.150
taking into account
changes in health,

01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:45.460
taking into account changes
in the natural environment,

01:00:45.460 --> 01:00:46.630
and so forth.

01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:50.860
So you could say, OK,
that's a relevant point.

01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:52.620
Another relevant
point is they talk

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:58.410
about increasing investment,
taking 2% of world GDP

01:00:58.410 --> 01:01:01.900
and investing it
in green things.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.590
Well, if you make
massive investments

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:08.520
and they're not terrible,
they will eventually

01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:10.740
raise growth, right?

01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:13.870
So you're increasing-- there
are numbers in my paper.

01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:14.620
They don't matter.

01:01:14.620 --> 01:01:16.710
But it's basically
what the UN is

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:18.840
saying is the world
as a whole needs

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:21.840
to make a massive increase
in green investments.

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:23.880
If you do that, you
probably will raise growth.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:26.530
That doesn't mean
it's a good idea.

01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:28.360
If you doubled the
US capital formation,

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:30.130
you'd raise us growth.

01:01:30.130 --> 01:01:31.150
A, how do you do it?

01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:33.700
B, is it actually a good deal?

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:38.480
But the kicker here,
most of these models say,

01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.640
here's how we raise growth.

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:45.292
We raise growth by reducing
environmental limits on growth.

01:01:45.292 --> 01:01:46.750
What would
environmental limits be?

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:51.160
Well, in the limit,
everybody gets sick

01:01:51.160 --> 01:01:54.600
and production and
productivity falls off.

01:01:54.600 --> 01:01:57.640
So if you've ever
tried to breathe

01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.620
in large Chinese
cities, you get a sense

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:02.630
that there is some theoretical--

01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:04.570
that this may be
more than theory

01:02:04.570 --> 01:02:08.480
in some places at some times.

01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:14.600
But globally, probably not.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.890
So two good points and one point
that's sort of OK in theory.

01:02:19.890 --> 01:02:22.470
The good points are--

01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:26.250
in terms of going
green-- that GDP growth

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:28.920
isn't really a good measure of
growth in standards of living.

01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.060
It isn't a good measure of
sustainability, period--

01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.530
sure.

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:36.240
Increasing the
rate of investment

01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:39.600
in green technologies
and lots of other things

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:41.190
will raise growth.

01:02:41.190 --> 01:02:42.240
Yeah.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.650
So would investment
in railroads,

01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:45.108
so so would investment
in highways,

01:02:45.108 --> 01:02:47.010
so would investments
in education.

01:02:47.010 --> 01:02:50.130
But that's certainly true.

01:02:50.130 --> 01:02:55.200
It is possible that
one way going green

01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:58.350
increases economic growth
is by sort of reducing

01:02:58.350 --> 01:03:00.600
environmental limits.

01:03:00.600 --> 01:03:05.520
The soil's exhausted, the people
are sick, et cetera, et cetera,

01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:08.820
the aquifers are depleted,
and you're stuck.

01:03:08.820 --> 01:03:10.780
That is certainly possible.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.200
And if you're really
a pessimistic person,

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:15.690
you can look down the
road, and climate change

01:03:15.690 --> 01:03:19.530
is another set of mechanisms
that could do this.

01:03:19.530 --> 01:03:21.270
But is it globally
quantitatively

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:24.270
important in the near term?

01:03:24.270 --> 01:03:26.860
No evidence.

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:27.360
OK.

01:03:32.190 --> 01:03:34.650
More relevant points.

01:03:34.650 --> 01:03:38.220
Certainly in rich countries,
you can make the argument

01:03:38.220 --> 01:03:42.210
that, yes, we should be greener
than we are, particularly

01:03:42.210 --> 01:03:43.350
in this country.

01:03:43.350 --> 01:03:46.140
If you think carbon
dioxide does anything,

01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.230
it probably makes
sense to switch--

01:03:49.230 --> 01:03:54.450
that understates the case to
switch to less carbon-intensive

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:57.420
growth paths, cut
emissions, conservation,

01:03:57.420 --> 01:03:58.830
shift to natural gas.

01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:02.640
The interesting question,
and the politically tricky

01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:05.460
question, is in poor countries.

01:04:05.460 --> 01:04:06.870
Because the green
growth story is

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:08.880
a story not about
the rich countries,

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.810
it's a story about
mostly poor countries--

01:04:12.810 --> 01:04:18.420
massive investments in going
green in poor countries.

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.553
Well, massive investments
in almost anything sensible

01:04:21.553 --> 01:04:23.220
in poor countries
would be a good thing.

01:04:23.220 --> 01:04:26.160
Where does it come from?

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.290
Probably doesn't
come internally.

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:31.642
This is the climate problem
revisited in a way--

01:04:31.642 --> 01:04:34.100
probably doesn't come internally
because they don't have it

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.460
and they have other priorities.

01:04:36.460 --> 01:04:39.640
Again, telling the Chinese
not to use the coal

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.670
while so many millions
of people live in poverty

01:04:42.670 --> 01:04:45.880
is a tough point, tough sale.

01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.860
Massive foreign aid?

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:51.970
Well, appropriating
massive foreign aid--

01:04:51.970 --> 01:04:55.360
again, there's some numbers in
my paper, about $400 billion

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.540
a year from the US.

01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.790
Imagine walking into Congress
and saying, yes, yes.

01:04:59.790 --> 01:05:02.970
I know we have problems but
we need to send $400 billion

01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:05.640
a year in foreign aid.

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.830
You would not get a
vote on the floor.

01:05:07.830 --> 01:05:10.710
You would not get a
vote in a committee.

01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:12.840
And the other problem
is the history says,

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.470
if you dump lots of
foreign aid on countries

01:05:16.470 --> 01:05:18.840
that don't have good
governance structures,

01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:20.640
you don't get good results.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.570
It gets stolen.

01:05:21.570 --> 01:05:23.980
It gets wasted.

01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.590
So that's not likely.

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:29.490
So without the aid, how
can you possibly, say,

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:33.510
in Africa, in particular, where
there is hydro potential, where

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:38.180
there is coal, and where
there is a lot of poverty,

01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:39.000
why not use it?

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.130
Now you can say--

01:05:40.130 --> 01:05:43.460
you could say--
actually, that's wrong.

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:47.760
You can say the equity
issues are absolutely clear.

01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:52.110
We talked about this when we
talked about climate change.

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:55.670
If I'm a poor country
and you say to me,

01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:59.300
we really need you to go green.

01:05:59.300 --> 01:06:03.420
I would say to you, you didn't.

01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:04.290
You got rich.

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:05.790
You burned your coal.

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:06.930
You cut down your trees.

01:06:06.930 --> 01:06:09.360
Why can't I?

01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:11.820
If you give me
money, maybe I won't.

01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:14.460
But maybe if you give
me money, I'll waste it.

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:16.830
It'll go to a bank account
in Switzerland or the Cayman

01:06:16.830 --> 01:06:18.480
Islands.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:23.940
Or I'll hire my
brother-in-law to build a dam.

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:26.580
So this is sort of
a terrible thing.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:30.360
Now this is
something that's sort

01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:32.220
of not on, as the English say.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:35.688
There's just no way to get it
done without massive transfers

01:06:35.688 --> 01:06:37.980
of aid, and there's no way
to get the massive transfers

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:39.330
of aid done--

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:43.090
as far as I can
tell, in any case.

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:46.410
One point I do want
to make, though,

01:06:46.410 --> 01:06:50.220
and that is while you're
thinking about startups, one

01:06:50.220 --> 01:06:53.520
of the really
interesting opportunities

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:58.620
globally is the large
number of people who

01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.560
have no electricity, period.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.530
Who are off-grid, who
are in rural areas.

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:06.030
And that's one of
those interesting

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:07.980
bottom-of-the-pyramid
opportunities that a lot

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:11.870
of people have tried to
crack because having lighting

01:07:11.870 --> 01:07:13.980
at night makes a
huge difference.

01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:17.030
It means kids can
stay in school.

01:07:17.030 --> 01:07:20.090
It means the family can
work after the sun goes down

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:21.140
at various things.

01:07:21.140 --> 01:07:22.880
But in particular,
kids can study.

01:07:25.930 --> 01:07:28.330
And there are a lot of
people who have tried

01:07:28.330 --> 01:07:30.700
to crack that economically.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:33.070
Usually some version
of solar plus storage

01:07:33.070 --> 01:07:36.040
deployed at the community
level or solar lanterns that

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:38.770
could be sold cheaply and
charged in the daytime

01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:39.970
and used at night.

01:07:39.970 --> 01:07:42.400
So there are lots of
opportunities there.

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.620
It isn't massive.

01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:47.140
It isn't massive.

01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:50.440
The other thing to point out is
one of the real tragedies here,

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:53.440
and one of the reasons why
the whole green growth notion

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:58.000
is compelling, but painful.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:03.610
And that is, again, there's
a piece on Stellar--

01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:06.130
if you ask who's going to
be harmed by climate change,

01:08:06.130 --> 01:08:09.250
it's mostly the
developing world, right?

01:08:09.250 --> 01:08:12.100
I mean, we can afford to
build a wall around Manhattan

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.960
to deal with sea level rise.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:17.090
Bangladesh can't build a wall.

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:18.700
But of course, the
developing world

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.010
is also driving
climate change if you

01:08:21.010 --> 01:08:23.890
look at the growth in
emissions, as we talked about

01:08:23.890 --> 01:08:25.120
on several occasions.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:27.010
There's just no obvious fix.

01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:31.060
So the green growth is trying
to-- is an attempt by a whole

01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:36.939
set of staff people to advocate
for massive change in the way

01:08:36.939 --> 01:08:41.560
the world runs that's
probably not going to work--

01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:43.908
not going to work
politically, which

01:08:43.908 --> 01:08:46.450
is one reason why I didn't feel
like doing an hour and a half

01:08:46.450 --> 01:08:51.279
on it, because I think
the air has gone out.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:54.875
There will be a circus in Rio.

01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:58.240
There will probably be 100 heads
of state or government in Rio

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.979
next month.

01:08:59.979 --> 01:09:05.200
I'm told hotel rooms are going
for thousands of a night,

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.729
so it will be a big circus.

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:09.880
I'm told that the
official US government

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.910
position is that
Rio should produce

01:09:12.910 --> 01:09:17.350
a clean five-page statement
of principles and policies,

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:20.830
and that the current working
draft is 260 pages long.

01:09:24.340 --> 01:09:26.200
Diplomats do this.

01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:29.410
Diplomats do this.

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:34.630
So this is the story of
people trying to figure out

01:09:34.630 --> 01:09:37.300
what comes after the Framework
Convention on Climate

01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.779
Change, what comes after
thinking about sustainability.

01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:42.490
And the answer is--

01:09:42.490 --> 01:09:45.899
or was-- a major push
toward being green,

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:48.880
please, really a
serious, major push.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.310
I think it lacks
intellectual foundation,

01:09:51.310 --> 01:09:53.470
I think it lacks
political foundation.

01:09:53.470 --> 01:09:55.960
I think it will be
much discussed at Rio

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.550
and nothing will happen.

01:09:58.550 --> 01:10:01.720
I do hate the last
talk to be so cynical.

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:05.380
Maybe we'll be hopeful next
week when we hear your papers.

01:10:05.380 --> 01:10:09.140
Do you have questions or
comments on any of this?

01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.750
That's sort of the-- this is
the current diplomatic state

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:12.440
of play.

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.440
This is an attempt to do
climate by the back door

01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:17.030
and call it green.

01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:20.390
It isn't going to
work, sadly, I think.

01:10:20.390 --> 01:10:21.332
Yeah, Julien?

01:10:21.332 --> 01:10:23.540
AUDIENCE: I was just curious
if you expected anything

01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:27.020
like productive at
all to come out of it?

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:29.990
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, you know, diplomacy

01:10:29.990 --> 01:10:31.790
is a really strange process.

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.380
It's easy to mock, right?

01:10:33.380 --> 01:10:38.180
Because particularly
in climate, there's

01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.590
this group of
diplomats that like

01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.240
to get together
every couple of years

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:44.450
and talk and make progress.

01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:49.130
But without government
support, it's all just talk.

01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:52.190
Given that the main problem
the world sees right now

01:10:52.190 --> 01:10:55.550
is slow recovery from
a deep recession,

01:10:55.550 --> 01:11:00.320
and given the current state of
politics in the US on climate,

01:11:00.320 --> 01:11:04.850
I expect lovely prose
to come out of this.

01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:07.760
There might be agreement
on something small.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.222
They might get
something on forests.

01:11:10.222 --> 01:11:12.680
I could give you my cynical
lecture about forest protection

01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:15.370
sometime.

01:11:15.370 --> 01:11:17.540
As long as you don't affect
the demand for wood--

01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:21.830
protecting this forest doesn't
reduce the amount of wood cut.

01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:25.130
But that's just the economist.

01:11:25.130 --> 01:11:27.660
I expect there will
be some agreements.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:29.557
I don't think they
will be very important.

01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:36.440
And as I say, I expect a circus.

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:38.350
The folks in the
diplomatic community

01:11:38.350 --> 01:11:40.720
would say that's too cynical.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:45.190
Even just talking with
the whole world involved,

01:11:45.190 --> 01:11:47.830
putting a spotlight
on these issues,

01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:51.430
keeping up pressure of
some international kind

01:11:51.430 --> 01:11:54.670
on governments that
don't want to act helps.

01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:59.410
Sort of the water on a
stone view of the world.

01:11:59.410 --> 01:12:00.760
That's what they do.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.890
And every so often,
there will be a chance.

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.210
You'll get the Montreal--

01:12:04.210 --> 01:12:07.090
you'll get the Montreal Protocol
on ozone depleting gases

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:10.090
because that
process had started.

01:12:10.090 --> 01:12:11.900
Those meetings were being held.

01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:14.380
New science came, the
structure was in place,

01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.480
the support mobilized, bang.

01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:18.790
We got a very constructive
international agreement.

01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:21.100
It isn't going to happen here
because the preconditions

01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.140
aren't there.

01:12:23.140 --> 01:12:26.725
But the water will
drip on the stone.

01:12:26.725 --> 01:12:28.100
The water will
drip on the stone.

01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:28.850
Rory?

01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:31.910
AUDIENCE: Has anyone-- well,
[INAUDIBLE] response to--

01:12:31.910 --> 01:12:35.255
he was saying, the rich world
didn't follow a green growth

01:12:35.255 --> 01:12:37.310
path, but they followed
the greenest growth

01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:40.340
path available to them at
the time within economics.

01:12:40.340 --> 01:12:43.343
And you could argue that
Britain, if they could have,

01:12:43.343 --> 01:12:45.260
Britain wouldn't have
covered all their cities

01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.730
in smog and soot.

01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:47.850
But they couldn't.

01:12:47.850 --> 01:12:51.740
The growth is good
for its own sake.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:54.290
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:57.060
That's a decent debating point.

01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:00.410
But you also say, when
did the rich world

01:13:00.410 --> 01:13:03.880
begin to take the
environment seriously?

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:07.580
And when did it begin to
have any impact on policy?

01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:10.980
And that's sort of
'60s, '70s, right?

01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:12.240
You don't see much--

01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:14.870
you don't see much
conscious thinking about it.

01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:23.060
The big US event was DDT and
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring,

01:13:23.060 --> 01:13:25.820
which was-- do you remember?

01:13:25.820 --> 01:13:26.600
'57?

01:13:26.600 --> 01:13:27.470
'62?

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:30.250
Around there-- around there.

01:13:30.250 --> 01:13:32.903
Birds were dying because DDT
was making their shells too thin

01:13:32.903 --> 01:13:34.070
and they couldn't reproduce.

01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:36.195
That was like oh my God,
our chemicals are actually

01:13:36.195 --> 01:13:37.430
doing something out there.

01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:40.148
But to most people, better
things through better

01:13:40.148 --> 01:13:41.190
living through chemistry.

01:13:41.190 --> 01:13:44.000
So to argue that we were
doing the best we could

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.790
is to argue that we were
doing it unconsciously.

01:13:46.790 --> 01:13:50.210
And that may be
true, but it's not--

01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:51.910
that's not that persuasive.

01:13:51.910 --> 01:13:53.840
It's a good shot, though.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:54.740
Anything else?

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:57.750
Anything else on your minds?

01:13:57.750 --> 01:13:59.460
Feeling ready for the
quiz on Wednesday?

01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:03.030
You were brilliantly
reviewed on Friday.

01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:04.170
Ready to go?

01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:05.520
OK.

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.490
Off we go.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.810
ALAN OPPENHEIM: Hi,
I'm Alan Oppenheim.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:57.750
And I'd like to welcome you
to this self-study course

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.450
on digital signal processing.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.290
The fact that you're
interested in taking the course

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.310
suggests that you're probably
aware of the important role

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.120
that digital techniques
have been playing in signal

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.100
processing, in general.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.820
And in fact, the impact
of digital technology

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.990
has been rather dramatic.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.170
And the indications
are that it will

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.160
be even more so in the future.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.210
One of the primary
advantages to digital as

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.270
opposed to analog signal
processing techniques

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.470
is the tremendous flexibility
that digital techniques

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.930
and digital signal
processing offers.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.860
And because of this flexibility,
digital signal processing

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.900
techniques have
found application

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.690
in a rather large or
wide variety of areas.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.080
Speech processing, for
example, has represented

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.870
one of the major
areas of application

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.490
of digital signal processing
for, at least, the past decade.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.660
Both analysis of speech
and synthesis of speech

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.960
rely very heavily
on the notions of,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.530
for example, digital
filtering, other notions,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.100
such as the fast Fourier
transform algorithm,

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.800
and a variety of the
other digital signal

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.490
processing techniques
and algorithms.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.460
More generally, in
communication systems,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.780
digital signal processing
is being used for coding,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.020
for multiplexing
and, in fact, there

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.070
is a considerable amount of work
being done at present directed

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.120
toward, basically, replacing
all of the present filtering

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.970
in communications
and telephone systems

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.280
by digital filters
instead of analog filters.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.400
And I think that it's
likely that, in the not

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.770
too distant future,
we'll see most

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:56.610
of the filtering in
communication systems being

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.160
done digitally.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.830
Seismic data
processing represents

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.170
another very important
area in which

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.660
the flexibility of
digital signal processing

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.970
is very heavily exploited.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.730
In fact, seismic and
speech processing

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.170
have probably been the
two major catalysts

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.590
for most of the
important developments

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.090
in digital signal processing.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.160
In audio recording
and processing,

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.070
digital signal processing
provides an opportunity

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:34.770
for some very sophisticated
processing and enhancement.

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:39.540
And in fact, fairly recently,
Professor Thomas Stockham

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.000
at the University
of Utah has been

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.490
applying some sophisticated
digital signal

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.260
processing techniques to the
restoration of old Caruso

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.700
recordings.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.610
The problem, in that case,
is that the recordings that

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.150
were originally made
in the days of Caruso

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:06.090
involved a recording horn,
as I've illustrated here.

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.690
The singer, of course, singing
into the recording horn.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.630
And the output of the
recording horn being

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.709
stored on a recording disk.

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.700
The problem in that
particular application

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.440
is the fact that the frequency
response of the recording horn

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:26.340
is not flat.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.830
And what this tended to do is
give the resulting recording

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.400
a, sort of, megaphone
type of distortion.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.870
And one of the objectives
in enhancing or restoring

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.630
some of these old
Caruso recordings

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.010
is to compensate, in a
sense, for the frequency

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.960
distortion introduced
by the recording horn.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.390
What Professor
Stockham has done,

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.610
basically, is to use digital
signal processing techniques

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.460
to, first of all,
estimate the frequency

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.860
response of the recording horn.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.120
And second, to compensate
for that frequency response.

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.670
And all of the work
that he carried out

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.930
was done digitally, primarily,
as I indicated previously,

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.580
primarily to capitalize
on the flexibility

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.890
that digital signal
processing offers.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:27.520
And some of the results that he
obtained are rather dramatic.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.300
And let me just illustrate
in a very short passage what

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:36.150
some of this has sounded like.

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.060
What I borrowed from
Professor Stockham

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.110
is a recording of
the restoration

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.140
that he generated on
a digital computer.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:50.610
And this particular recording
is a two track recording

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.500
with the original
segment recorded

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.970
on channel 1 and the process
segment recorded on channel 2.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:03.110
And that will allow us to switch
back and forth between these.

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.700
The particular piece
that is illustrated here

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:11.420
is a section from the famous
aria "Vesti La Giubba"

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.870
as sung, of course,
by Enrico Caruso.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.420
So let me just quickly
illustrate this

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:21.560
as an example of some of
the type of processing

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:25.310
that is currently being done
using digital signal processing

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.530
techniques.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:30.740
Let me begin, first
of all, by playing

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:33.060
a little bit of the original.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.420
And then, I'll switch to the
result of Professor Stockholm's

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.590
enhancement.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.410
And then, switch back
and forth a few times

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:44.690
to present a comparison.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:49.970
So we begin, first of
all, with the original.

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:52.460
[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, "VESTI LA
 GIUBBA"]

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.356
And then switch to the enhanced.

00:06:57.356 --> 00:07:03.450
[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, "VESTI LA
 GIUBBA"]

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:04.550
Back to the original.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.334
[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, "VESTI

00:07:06.334 --> 00:07:09.792
LA GIUBBA"]

00:07:09.792 --> 00:07:12.040
And then, once more,
to the enhanced.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:22.250
[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, "VESTI LA
 GIUBBA"]

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.740
And I think what you
can observe with that

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:29.780
is a fairly dramatic increase in
the improvement in the quality

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:30.590
of the recording.

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.610
Primarily, the megaphone type
of quality in the original

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.980
has been, essentially,
eliminated.

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.370
Now to go even further
in illustrating

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:45.540
some of the flexibility of
digital signal processing.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.180
One of the things
that we observe

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.210
with this particular recording
and this particular example

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:53.930
is that, although there
is some enhancement that's

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:58.850
been implemented, there still
is some background noise that

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:03.170
is present in, both, the
original and the enhanced

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:04.490
or restored.

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.410
And so one of the
things, obviously,

00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:11.520
that we would like to do is
remove this background noise.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.830
In fact, using some rather
sophisticated signal processing

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:21.080
techniques, Professor Stockham,
together with Neil J. Miller,

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:25.560
have not only removed
the background noise

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:28.880
but, with the same
processing, removed also

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.890
the orchestral accompaniment.

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:33.770
Now this is, first of
all, rather dramatic.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.370
Second of all, somewhat useful
in the sense that in carrying

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.559
out a complete restoration
one can imagine then

00:08:40.559 --> 00:08:48.560
redubbing a new orchestra on
top of the restored recording.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.560
So let me just play a little
bit of this to, in fact,

00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.910
show you that it really has
been possible to not only remove

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.820
the background noise
but also to remove

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.090
the orchestral accompaniment.

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:07.520
So first let me move forward
on the tape to the right place.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:19.800
And what you'll hear now
in this case, on channel 1,

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:28.590
is the Caruso recording restored
as I indicated previously.

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:32.850
And on channel 2 is the
result of further processing,

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:35.460
the restored recording,
to eliminate,

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:41.190
both, the background noise
and also the orchestra.

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:43.410
So we'll begin
with the restored,

00:09:43.410 --> 00:09:44.760
which includes the orchestra.

00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.776
And then, the orchestra removed.

00:09:46.776 --> 00:09:49.056

00:09:49.947 --> 00:09:51.030
That's with the orchestra.

[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, "VESTI LA
 GIUBBA"]

00:09:54.204 --> 00:09:56.730
And with the orchestra and
the background noise removed.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:10.590
[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO, "VESTI LA
 GIUBBA"]

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:13.535
And then, once more, back to
the orchestral [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:13.535 --> 00:10:14.870
[MUSIC ENRICO CARUSO,

00:10:14.870 --> 00:10:18.440
"VESTI LA GIUBBA"]

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.840
Well I think that
you'll probably

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.170
have to admit
that, in fact, it's

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.320
a rather dramatic example of
some sophisticated digital

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.180
signal processing.

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.350
Another area in which
digital signal processing

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:38.280
has tremendous
potential is in the area

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:41.670
of digital image processing.

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:46.230
And in that case,
the basic notion

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:52.350
is to treat an image as a two
dimensional signal digitized,

00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.980
of course.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.500
And one is then
afforded the possibility

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.410
of applying digital signal
processing techniques

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:01.710
to the two dimensional signal.

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:05.790
For example, in a very simple
signal processing environment,

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:10.240
we might be interested in low
pass filtering a digital image.

00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.060
For example, if the image
has considerable grain noise,

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:18.000
grain noise, in fact,
tends to be high frequency.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.200
And low pass filtering then
will tend to reduce or eliminate

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.850
noise of that type.

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:27.360
Or we might be interested
in high pass filtering.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.190
For example, if we wanted to
enhance edges in a picture,

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.370
the procedure would
be or one procedure

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:41.370
might be to apply a two
dimensional high pass filter.

00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:45.600
More elaborately,
we could consider

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:50.220
some processing, which is
directed at general image

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.480
enhancement.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:55.530
And one example that I'd like to
show you is some digital image

00:11:55.530 --> 00:11:58.620
processing that was
carried out directed

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:04.560
at simultaneously reducing
the dynamic range of an image

00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.490
and increasing the
contrast of the image.

00:12:08.490 --> 00:12:10.230
Generally,
photographically, these

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.120
are conflicting requirements.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.820
But with some
sophisticated processing,

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:19.410
it's possible to simultaneously
reduce the dynamic range

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:21.930
and increase the contrast.

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:26.430
To illustrate how this
works with an example,

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:31.170
the first slide that I'll show
you is an original image, which

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:36.750
is, of course, a digital image
displayed on a computer scope.

00:12:36.750 --> 00:12:39.630
And one of the things that
we notice about that image

00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.330
is that it has a rather
high dynamic range.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:45.960
For example, the snow
outside the boiler room

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.280
is rather bright.

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:50.070
The inside of the
boiler room is dark.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.550
And of course, the contrast
inside the boiler room

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:57.540
is relatively low
because of the fact

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.960
that the illumination inside the
boiler room is relatively low.

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.800
So one type of processing
that we could consider

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.940
is the simultaneous
enhancement of contrast,

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:12.810
and reduction of dynamic
range, and applying some two

00:13:12.810 --> 00:13:15.000
dimensional signal processing.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.510
The result is what I show
you on the next slide

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:25.290
where, here, we've
processed to bring out

00:13:25.290 --> 00:13:28.140
the detail inside
the boiler room.

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.770
You can notice that the dynamic
range, in fact, is reduced.

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.860
The snow is darker than
it was in the original.

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.610
The boiler room is brighter
than it was in the original,

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:41.010
suggesting reduced
dynamic range.

00:13:41.010 --> 00:13:45.780
But also, the contrast
is very clearly enhanced.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:50.200
Just as another example of
the same type of processing.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.100
First, let's look
at an original where

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:56.020
we observe that there's a
brightly illuminated area,

00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:58.980
which is where the
radome moves is.

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:01.920
And then, a more dimly
illuminated area.

00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.092
The details in the
right hand corner

00:14:04.092 --> 00:14:05.175
with the trees and leaves.

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.850
And as a result
of processing to,

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:16.890
again, increase the contrast
and reduce the dynamic range,

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:20.130
we see in the resulting
processed image

00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:25.590
that the detail in the
dimly illuminated areas,

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.650
in fact, is brought out
rather dramatically.

00:14:29.650 --> 00:14:37.560
So this is one example of
some rather sophisticated

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.780
digital signal
processing applied

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.010
to two dimensional signals.

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.870
Namely, to images.

00:14:42.870 --> 00:14:44.970
And I should
mention incidentally

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:48.990
that the type of processing
that was applied for this image

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.040
enhancement is discussed in
considerable detail in chapter

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:55.540
10 of the text.

00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.300
Now there are, of course, a
long list of other applications

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:02.340
of digital signal processing.

00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.650
In the biomedical
area, for example,

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:06.780
digital signal
processing techniques

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.480
are playing a very
important role.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.990
In radar and sonar, those
are two additional areas

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.760
in which digital
signal processing

00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.440
is extremely important.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.840
And I'm sure that
there are other areas

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.780
that you're aware of that
I, perhaps, might not

00:15:21.780 --> 00:15:26.790
be where digital signal
processing is particularly

00:15:26.790 --> 00:15:31.010
important because
of its flexibility.

00:15:33.900 --> 00:15:36.630
Specifically, in
this course, we won't

00:15:36.630 --> 00:15:39.600
be focusing on applications.

00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:42.660
Although, it's important
to keep in mind as we

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.300
go through the course
that the material

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.620
that we're talking about has
very important applications.

00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.470
In the course, we'll be
concentrating specifically

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.670
on the fundamentals and
techniques of digital signal

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:59.310
processing.

00:15:59.310 --> 00:16:02.460
As I've indicated
in the study guide,

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.580
I will be assuming
that you previously

00:16:05.580 --> 00:16:10.470
have had a course in linear
system theory, continuous time

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:15.810
linear system theory, including
Fourier and Laplace transforms.

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:20.310
But I will not be assuming
any specific background

00:16:20.310 --> 00:16:24.060
in discrete time signals
and systems in Z-transforms,

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:24.990
et cetera.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:29.160
In fact, in the next
lecture, lecture two,

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:31.110
we will begin from
the beginning.

00:16:31.110 --> 00:16:34.590
Namely, we will begin with a
definition of discrete time

00:16:34.590 --> 00:16:36.250
signals and systems.

00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:40.710
And if you feel a little
rusty on basic linear system

00:16:40.710 --> 00:16:42.660
theory for continuous
time systems,

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.809
it might be well
before then to do

00:16:45.809 --> 00:16:47.100
just a little bit of reviewing.

00:16:47.100 --> 00:16:51.600
And I suggest some possible
books in the study guide.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.950
I would also suggest, before
beginning the next lecture,

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:00.540
that you read the
introduction to the text.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:05.520
And perhaps, also browse through
the text and the study guide

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:09.480
to get a general impression
of the scope of the course,

00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:13.020
and some of the
objectives of the course.

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.810
As I indicated,
next time, we will

00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:19.319
begin with the definition
of discrete time signals

00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.180
and systems.

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.180
I sincerely hope that you
find this set of lessons

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.010
to be interesting
and worthwhile.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:29.590
And I'll see you at
the next lecture.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.200
Thank you.

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:33.650

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.280
For a particle that's
moving in a circle,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:15.840
we found that when it's moving
at a constant rate of d theta

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.540
dt--- and let's recall what
we meant by theta of t--

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.500
and here's our particle,
and we introduced our polar

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.830
coordinates r hat and theta hat,
then we found that the velocity

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.550
was r d theta dt theta hat.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.840
And so let's assume that
this quantity is positive,

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.830
in which case the velocity is
pointing in the positive theta

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.800
direction.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.660
And that means that
everywhere in the circle,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.820
the velocity is
tangential to the circle,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.670
and the magnitude is a constant.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.560
So for this case of
uniform circular motion,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.440
we calculated that
the acceleration

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:10.350
was equal to minus r d theta dt
quantity squared r hat, which

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.470
means that at every point, the
acceleration vector is pointing

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:16.420
towards the center.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.990
Now we can write that
acceleration vector

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.420
as a component a of r-- r hat--
where this component is given

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.979
by r times d theta dt squared.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.630
It it's always negative, because
when you square this quantity,

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.500
it's always a positive quantity.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.770
The minus sign, just
to remember-- that

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.770
means that the acceleration
is pointing inward.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.420
Now how can we think about that?

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.930
Well, if we look at the velocity
vector, what's happening here

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.940
is the velocity is
not changing magnitude

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.960
but changing direction.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.750
And if you compare
two points-- and let's

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.040
just pick two arbitrary points.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.170
So let's remove this
acceleration for a moment

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.960
and consider two arbitrary
points-- say, a time t1 and t2.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.430
So our velocity
vectors are tangent.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.020
The length of these
vectors are the same.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.440
And if we move them tail
to tail-- [? Vt2-- ?]

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.570
and take the difference,
delta v, where

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.250
delta v is equal to v
of t2 minus V of t1,

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.070
then we can get an understanding
why the acceleration

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.340
is pointing inward,
because recall

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.810
that acceleration
by definition is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.980
a limit as delta t goes to 0.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.870
That means as this
point approaches

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.090
that point of the change
in velocity over time.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.730
And so when we
look at this limit

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.480
as we shrink down our time
interval between t2 and t1,

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.940
then this vector will
point towards the center

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.100
of the circle.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.074
And that's why
the direction of a

00:03:09.074 --> 00:03:13.000
is in the minus r hat direction.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.250
Again, let's just recall
that this is the case

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.510
for we called uniform
circular motion, which

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.880
is defined by the condition
that d theta dt is a constant.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.100
PROFESSOR: All right, so what
we're going to do for the next

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.490
few lectures, really through the
end of the course, is turn

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.280
away from what we focused on for
most of this course, which

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.710
is efficiency, and start
talking about equity.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.620
So most of this course, we've
talked about efficiency and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.750
the principles that lead
to efficient outcomes.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.700
We haven't talked a whole lot
about fairness and equity.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.160
We've mentioned it in passing
for things like why you want a

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.980
minimum wage, et cetera, but we
haven't really focused on

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.710
how society should consider
efficiency and equity as two

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.130
different goals, because
clearly it does.

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:05.850
So for example, a classic
example of the fact that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.530
efficient outcomes may not be
equally equitable is the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.390
perfectly competitive market
versus the perfectly price

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.850
discriminating monopolist.
Remember that both outcomes,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.200
both a perfectly competitive
market and a perfectly price

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.080
discriminating monopolist,
both lead to

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.610
maximum social welfare.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.790
So in the terms we've used in
this course, both provide

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.230
equal social welfare.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.250
The difference, of course, being
that in the perfectly

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.760
price discriminating monopolist
case, the producer

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.920
gets it all, whereas in the
perfectly competitive case,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.710
it's shared between producers
and consumers.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.960
So we actually care.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.260
We actually in the end are going
to care as a society,

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.160
not just about social welfare,
but who's getting the shares

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.650
of the pie.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.610
In other words, we're not going
to care just about the

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.985
size of the pie, but who's
getting what shares.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.410
So first of all, even for a
given size of the pie, we have

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.330
to decide who gets
what shares.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.130
Moreover, it gets much more
complicated than that because

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.550
the size of the pie
isn't fixed.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.570
And typically, in a society's
efforts to redistribute

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.490
shares, they shrink the pie.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.290
That is, societies typically
face the classical equity

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.540
efficiency trade off.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.430
Which is that in any effort
to redistribute resources,

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.790
inevitably we'll shrink
the total amount

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.670
of resources available.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.730
And that's roughly speaking,
because the efficient outcome

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.280
is where you start from.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.620
You start from an outcome
where you've

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.420
maximized social welfare.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.970
So any intervention that tries
to deviate from that by moving

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.810
resources across groups, by
definition will move us away

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.100
from that efficient outcome.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.260
We're starting with the
efficient outcome, let's say a

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.870
permanently price discriminating
monopolist,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:01.760
that's efficient.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.060
Any efforts we have to take
some money away from that

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.400
monopolist and give it to
other people will end up

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.140
causing distortions and reducing
the total size of

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.340
total social welfare.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.070
So basically, we're always
going to face this equity

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.240
efficiency trade off, and really
the question we want to

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.750
ask in this lecture is,
is it worth it?

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.810
How do we think about whether
it's worth it to redistribute

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.580
from rich to poor, even if along
the way, we shrink the

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.200
total size of the pie, even if
we have to deviate from the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.870
welfare maximizing point.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.890
And the best way to think about
this I think is due to

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:35.470
an analogy developed by
a famous economist

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.460
named Arthur Okun.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.060
And this is Okun's leaky
bucket analogy.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.970
So Okun's leaky bucket analogy
is the following, he said,

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.210
look, let's say as a society,
we agree that we should

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.470
redistribute from
rich to poor.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.400
And I'll come later to why we
might agree that, but let's

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.210
just say we agree as a society
that we should redistribute

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:55.290
from the richest members to the

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.810
poorest members of society.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:00.090
And let's think of that
redistribution as being

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.840
literally the rich people put
money in a bucket, and you

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.640
carry that bucket and then dump
it out in front of the

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.650
poor people.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.240
Let's say that's the way
redistribution happened.

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.540
Well, probably we'd have general
agreement that if Bill

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.240
Gates could put $1 in a bucket
and it could be carried and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.890
given to a homeless person,
that's a good thing.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.839
We probably in general agree
that if you distribute from

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:22.310
the richest people to the
poorest people, and $1 from a

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.390
rich person becomes $1
for a poor person,

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.560
that's a good thing.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.220
However, what if along the
way, some of that dollar

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.890
leaked out?

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.410
What if Bill Gates put $1 in the
bucket, but by the time it

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.510
got to the poor person,
it was only $0.80.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.840
You might say, OK, that's still
fine. $0.80 to a poor

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.740
person is a lot.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.440
Bill Gates isn't going
to miss $1, but $0.80

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.750
to them might matter.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.920
What if it's only $0.50?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.090
What if Bill Gates put $1 in, by
the time you carry it over,

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.690
it leaks out so much so the poor
person only gets $0.50?

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.610
What if it's $0.10?

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.380
What if literally every dollar
Bill Gates gives up, the poor

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.670
person only gets $0.10, then you
might say, gee, it's not

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.550
entirely clear it's
worth it anymore.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.990
I mean, yeah, $0.10 is worth
more to a poor person than a

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.040
$1 is to Bill Gates, but that's
really wasteful to have

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.800
$0.90 just leak out
along the way.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.700
So basically, what we have to
do is ask basically how does

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:17.430
society think about transfers
when some of what happens when

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.080
you transfer from rich to poor
is you lose some efficiency

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.110
along the way, something leaks
out of the bucket?

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:24.870
And that's basically what we're
going to talk about in

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.320
the next two lectures.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.390
We're going to do that
in four steps.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.195
We're first going to ask, how
does society value transfers?

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.240
How does society think about the
value of $1 to Bill Gates

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.740
versus $1 to a poor person?

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.800
How do we think about the value
of those dollars in

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.360
different hands, something
we haven't

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.240
talked about this semester?

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.920
We then are going to talk about
the facts on income

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:51.690
distribution.

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.510
How has the distribution of
dollars changed over time in

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:58.770
the US, and how do we compare
it internationally?

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.185
Then we're going to talk about
the sources of leakage.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:08.310
That is, what causes this bucket
to be leaky, in fact,

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:09.730
what causes the equity
efficiency

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:12.460
trade off in practice.

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.200
And then finally, we're going to
talk about what governments

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:21.470
do, what government does to
redistribute resources.

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.460
How does the US government in
particular redistribute

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.790
resources from higher to
lower income groups?

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:28.610
So that's what we're
going to talk about

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.370
the next two lectures.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.510
So we're going to start with
the question of how does

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.870
society value transfers, or
more generally, how do we

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:46.330
think about the socially
optimal

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:47.580
allocation of resources?

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.520
The key word here being
allocation.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.960
So we're no longer just going to
talk about the entire size

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.540
of the social welfare triangle,
we're now going to

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:06.010
talk about who gets what, and
how do we think about the

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.760
socially optimal distribution of
those resources, allocation

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.010
or distribution of
those resources.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:17.530
And to do so, we're going to
have to take an extra somewhat

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.500
uncomfortable step we haven't
taken before.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.120
Before, we've just talked about
a purely mathematical

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.120
concept of maximizing the
size of a triangle.

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:29.460
Now we've got to actually put
some value judgment on who

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:31.970
gets what within
that triangle.

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:33.850
And the way we make that value
judgment is through the

00:07:33.850 --> 00:07:36.095
introduction of what we call
a social welfare function.

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:43.730
A social welfare function,
which is literally the

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:46.440
mathematical representation,
because we're all

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:48.460
about the math here.

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.930
It's a mathematical
representation of how society

00:07:51.930 --> 00:07:54.740
values different groups.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.700
So social welfare function is
some function of the utility

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.370
of individual one, the utility
of individual two, all the way

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:04.980
to the utility of individual
350 million, however many

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.530
people we have now in the US.

00:08:07.530 --> 00:08:10.510
It's literally a mathematical
representation of how we take

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.400
every individual's utility and
come up with a measure of

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.650
social welfare.

00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:20.170
That's what the social welfare
function's going to be.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:20.850
So think about that.

00:08:20.850 --> 00:08:24.120
Let's look at figure 23-1,
which shows what we call

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.900
isowelfare curves.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.320
Think about a society with two
people, Ned and Homer, and

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.850
think about the government's
decision,

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.870
or think about society--

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:37.070
excuse the word government,
think about

00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:38.270
society right now--

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:42.610
society's valuation of the
allocation of resources across

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.370
these two individuals.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:49.030
Each of these curves is meant
to represent a social

00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:49.990
indifference curve.

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:51.510
In other words, think
of society as

00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:52.550
having a utility function.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:56.140
Think of this being a social
utility function, and the

00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.930
utility function has
indifference curves.

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.870
So society has some indifference
curves.

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:06.380
So what this depiction says is
society's indifferent between

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.270
Homer having u1h and Ned having
u1n, that is, with Ned

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.520
having a lot and Homer
having a little.

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:16.640
Or Homer having u2h and Ned
having u2n, that is Homer

00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:18.980
having a lot and Ned
having a little.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:20.770
So I've just made this up.

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:23.075
I've drawn this curve such that
society is indifferent

00:09:23.075 --> 00:09:24.325
between those two allocations.

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.090
And basically, these isowelfare
curves will look

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.000
just like our indifference
curves.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.620
So we've talked in this course
about choosing between goods.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:38.300
We've talked about choosing
between states of the world,

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.800
injured not injured.

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.660
We've talked about choosing
between periods of time, today

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.090
versus tomorrow.

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:46.220
Now I'm talking about the
hardest one of all, choosing

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.520
between people, choosing between
the utility of people.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.960
But it's the same damn
principle, it's the same stuff

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.780
we've always done, which is
there's some utility function,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.300
now we call it a social
welfare function.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:02.330
You maximize it across
its elements--

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.020
here it's the utility of Ned
and Homer, and you develop

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.190
some indifference curves.

00:10:06.190 --> 00:10:07.780
And they have all the properties
indifference curves

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.410
always had, further out is
better, that a society is

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:13.850
happier if both Ned and Homer
have more, and along the

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.760
curve, you're indifferent.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.910
So these are representations
of how society feels about

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.090
transfers across people.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:26.190
So the big question then
becomes, what does this social

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.270
welfare function look like?

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.580
Mathematically, how do you
represent this incredibly hard

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:34.790
question of the trade
off across people?

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.560
And this is an incredibly deep
question, but the standard

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.080
social welfare function that's
used is something due to

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.190
Jeremy Bentham, a famous
English philosopher.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:47.650
You can actually still see his
head if you go to University

00:10:47.650 --> 00:10:49.390
College London.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:50.660
Actually, it's not a
representation of his head,

00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.510
they actually had him stuffed
and his head on display, but

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.050
then apparently, students would
take it at night and use

00:10:55.050 --> 00:10:56.060
it for soccer.

00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.880
So they now just have a
representation of his head

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.560
there at UCL.

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:05.190
But Jeremy Bentham developed
what we call utilitarianism,

00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:08.160
the utilitarian social
welfare function.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.160
And utilitarianism simply says
that the social welfare of

00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:21.100
society is simply the sum of
each individual's utility.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:27.890
So u1 plus u2 plus dot dot
dot plus u350 million.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.720
That's social welfare.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:34.660
That is the social welfare of
US society, is the sum of

00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:37.070
everyone's utility.

00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:39.000
Very straightforward.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.650
So it's a linear social
welfare function.

00:11:42.650 --> 00:11:47.530
So what this says is this says
you would maximize social

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:53.330
welfare by transferring from
any one individual to any

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.910
other individual, if the first
individual has a higher

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.090
utility that the second
individual.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:04.750
So basically you maximize
social welfare, is that

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:07.300
basically if you--

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:08.620
I'm sorry, let me say
it another way.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.350
If transferring $1 from me to
you makes you better off than

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.660
it makes me worse off,
then we should do it.

00:12:18.590 --> 00:12:22.370
Now, your first instinct might
be, well, this isn't very

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.830
liberal in a sense, this is
just saying everybody's

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:25.680
utility is the same.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.590
That is, we consider Bill Gates
is one of these people,

00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.110
and I'm one of these people,
and you're one of these

00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:31.750
people, and the homeless guy
in Harvard Square is one of

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:32.540
these people.

00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.190
And they're all just added up.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:39.110
How is that fair?

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:40.840
In fact, let me ask the
question differently.

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:45.020
Why despite that is utilitarian
wealth, social

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:47.370
welfare function can it be
perceived as fairly liberal,

00:12:47.370 --> 00:12:49.160
despite the fact that everyone
just gets added up?

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.390
Why in fact is social welfare
function that's utilitarian

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:54.880
call for transfers from Bill
Gates to homeless person?

00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.360
Yeah?

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:57.290
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:58.400
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.570
If you maximize social welfare,
what it's going to

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:04.870
say is set marginal
utilities equal.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:06.910
If you differentiate this with
respect to everybody's

00:13:06.910 --> 00:13:10.600
utility, you're going to get
that the rule that you get

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.610
from maximizing, the first order
condition mathematically

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:16.750
is going to be that everyone's
margin utility should be equal

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:18.930
with utilitarian social welfare
function, which is

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:20.820
very radical.

00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:23.550
That says that we should
redistribute until Bill Gates

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:27.850
has the same marginal utility
as the homeless person.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:29.800
Thought of that way, that's
incredibly radical

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.570
redistribution.

00:13:30.570 --> 00:13:32.420
It's not weighting Bill Gates
equally to the homeless

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:34.860
person, it's weighting his
utility equal, but it's saying

00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:38.180
we should have massive
transfers.

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:41.950
In fact, basically we should
equalize income in society,

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:43.880
effectively.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:47.470
That basically, what
we should do is--

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:49.260
in fact, let me be
more precise.

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:52.360
If individuals are identical,
which they're not, but if

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:55.820
individuals had identical
tastes, the utilitarian social

00:13:55.820 --> 00:13:58.860
welfare function would say
that social welfare is

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:02.580
maximized with an equal
distribution of income.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.810
Pretty radical.

00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.570
If individuals are identical,
social welfare is maximized

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:09.920
with the equal distribution of
income, despite the fact we

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.910
started with this pretty
un-obnoxious looking function,

00:14:12.910 --> 00:14:14.850
we're simply going to weight
everybody equally.

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:16.700
We're not even saying we care
more about poor people than

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.730
rich people, we're saying weight
everybody equally.

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:22.030
That fairly innocuous looking
function delivers the radical

00:14:22.030 --> 00:14:24.620
implication that if everyone is
identical, we should have

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.970
an equal distribution of
income in society.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:30.770
And that's a typical social
welfare function

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.590
that we look at.

00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:35.485
But that actually is not
considered really a

00:14:35.485 --> 00:14:36.840
particularly lefty social
welfare function.

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:38.830
In fact, if you talk to the left
side of the philosophical

00:14:38.830 --> 00:14:41.380
distribution, they'll
say this is not an

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:43.610
appropriate measure to use.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:49.350
They much prefer something like
the Rawlsian criteria,

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:52.506
named for the philosopher
John Rawls.

00:14:52.506 --> 00:14:57.370
The Rawlsian social welfare
function is that the role that

00:14:57.370 --> 00:15:01.430
society's goal should be to
maximize the well-being of its

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.780
worst off member.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.720
That a fair and just society
is one which maximizes the

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.000
well-being of the worst
off person in society.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.610
So that says social welfare is
equal to the min of u1, u2,

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:19.860
dot dot dot dot.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:25.330
So it's a max-a-min criteria.

00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:30.120
You want to maximize the min,
maximize the minimum utility

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:33.130
in society is the Rawlsian
social welfare function.

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:44.980
Now, in some situations,
this can deliver--

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:48.820
in fact, if everyone's
identical, this would deliver

00:15:48.820 --> 00:15:51.820
in many cases the same outcome
as utilitarianism.

00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.750
But in some cases, it's much
more radically lefty.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:56.340
Think about it this way.

00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:01.500
Suppose we had a situation where
everybody but me and

00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.940
you, but me and this guy
have equal incomes.

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:10.070
Everybody in the world's equal
income is at $40,000.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:14.490
But my income is $1 million,
and his income is $39,999,

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:19.300
he's got $1 less income
than the rest of you.

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:22.080
And let's say that a new
government is running for

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:25.200
office that proposes to take
away all of my money, so I'm

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.480
down to $40,000, and
give him $1 and

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.242
bring him up to $40,000.

00:16:30.242 --> 00:16:33.060
Now in utilitarianism, that
would not be an appropriate

00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:36.120
thing to do, because clearly
my utility is going to fall

00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.580
more from going from 1 million
to 40,000 than his is going to

00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:42.240
go from going 39,999
to 40,000.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.020
So under utilitarianism this
would be a bad thing to do.

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:47.280
But in Rawlsianism, it'd be a
good thing to do, because he's

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.780
the worst off member.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:51.320
So it doesn't matter what
happens to me, it only matters

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.200
what happens to him.

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.640
So Rawlsiansim is an incredibly
radical theory,

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.510
which posits that we only care
what happens to the poorest

00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:01.190
guy, even if we have to like
take all the money away from

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:02.980
the richest guys,
we don't care.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.579
We only care about what happens
to the poorest guy.

00:17:06.579 --> 00:17:11.490
So that's a very radical sort of
lefty view of how we should

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:12.740
think about distribution.

00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:20.020
On the other hand, we have
a very radical--

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:22.829
well, some would say a more
radical view on the right,

00:17:22.829 --> 00:17:29.430
which is a Nozickian social
welfare function, named for

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:33.830
the philosopher Robert Nozick,
also at Harvard.

00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:35.960
Rawls and Nozick were
both at Harvard.

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.880
Nozick said this is just
way too radical.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.490
He said utilitarianism is
way too radical, way

00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:41.660
too far to the left.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.450
Forget Rawlsianiasm,
that's just nutty.

00:17:43.450 --> 00:17:45.420
Even utilitarianism is way too
far to the left, because he

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:50.040
says, basically what should
matter in society is an equal

00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:53.160
distribution of resources--

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:56.110
I'm sorry, an equal distribution
of opportunities.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.850
And conditional on equal
distribution of opportunities,

00:17:58.850 --> 00:18:01.190
if individuals take those
opportunities and choose to do

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:03.400
outcomes which give them
different incomes, that's

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.190
their problem.

00:18:05.190 --> 00:18:08.460
So for example, let's say that
we started with everyone in

00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:12.580
the world started with an equal
distribution of income.

00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.150
But let's say that MIT students
loved to hear me

00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:20.320
lecture, and were willing to pay
$100 to hear me lecture.

00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:23.750
And so at the end of the year,
every MIT student ended up

00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:27.430
$100 poorer and I ended
up a ton richer.

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.670
Well, under both utilitarianism,
and certainly

00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.180
under Rawlsiansim, that is an
outcome which is not social

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:36.550
welfare maximizing, because I
don't care about that last

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:38.180
$100 whereas you guys care
a little bit about

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.310
giving up the $100.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:42.390
So clearly social welfare would
be maximized if I gave

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:44.660
some of that money
back to you.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.880
Under Rawlsianism, clearly I
should give it all back to

00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:51.610
you, because all we care about
is you guys being $100 poorer.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.850
Nozick says this is crazy.

00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.690
This is a voluntary
transaction.

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.890
You guys voluntarily paid me
$100, making me richer.

00:18:59.890 --> 00:19:03.060
Why should there be any
redistribution?

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.100
Why should social welfare
be any lower from that

00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:06.710
transaction?

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:08.380
How could a voluntary
transaction

00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:10.280
lower social welfare?

00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:16.100
And this is sort of a right
wing approach to thinking

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.210
about social welfare, which is
look, everybody should have

00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:21.730
equal opportunities.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.520
It's not fair to have some
person not have access to

00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.420
education and things.

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:27.120
But once everybody's got equal
opportunities, there's no

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.090
reason why if you make voluntary
choices that lead to

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.680
unequal distribution of
income we should care.

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.030
Now this is actually
very compelling.

00:19:36.030 --> 00:19:40.530
It has a lot of merit, and
really should make us think

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:42.140
about our emphasis should be on

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.430
opportunities rather than outcomes.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:48.480
But it has one flaw, which is
that in fact, most of the

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:52.375
differences in society aren't
due to choices, but rather due

00:19:52.375 --> 00:19:56.890
to outcomes outside people's
control, often just luck.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:00.210
So basically, if it was true
that we all started equal and

00:20:00.210 --> 00:20:03.460
that any differences in income
came through our choices, then

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.000
this would be a very powerful
way of looking at the world.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.580
But in fact, if you look at
most differences in income

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:10.890
across people, they're not due
to their choices, or to

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.720
effort, or to other things you
can actually figure out how to

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.460
measure, they're due to
unmeasured things.

00:20:14.460 --> 00:20:17.160
Often it looks like luck.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.952
And in that case, you would care
about the fact that I end

00:20:22.952 --> 00:20:24.150
up richer than you.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:25.420
So if I end up richer than you
because you're willing to pay

00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.090
me, that's one thing.

00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:27.740
But if I'm richer than you just
because I won the lottery

00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:32.060
and you didn't, that's a
different thing altogether.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.690
And so basically, whether how we
feel about the equality of

00:20:35.690 --> 00:20:39.230
opportunities view versus the
equality of outcomes view

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.450
depends very much on what we
think is the source of

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.860
difference in incomes.

00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.050
If we think it has to do with
effort and choices, then

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.410
people can often favor this
view, that if people by their

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.880
effort and choices made more
money, let them keep it.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:56.040
But if people made more money
through luck and things beyond

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:58.810
their control, then people tend
towards more this view,

00:20:58.810 --> 00:21:01.010
saying look, if you got your
money through luck and things,

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.010
there's no reason why we should
have such an unequal

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.630
distribution of income.

00:21:04.630 --> 00:21:07.270
And that's sort of another
tension in thinking about

00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:08.600
these social welfare
functions.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.630
There are no right
answers here.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.395
I don't mean through my tone
or word choice to imply

00:21:12.395 --> 00:21:13.130
there's any right answer.

00:21:13.130 --> 00:21:15.400
I'm just trying to lay out the
arguments for these different

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.750
ways of thinking about it.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.480
Then finally, the last way we
could think about it, and to

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.430
many people, really the most
compelling, is through what we

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:27.940
call commodity egalitarianism.

00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:39.140
Commodity egalitarianism, which
is a fancy name for

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.360
saying look, it doesn't
matter who has what.

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.960
It just matters that everybody
can survive.

00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.313
This is kind of like a
reinterpretation of Rawls.

00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.600
It's almost a mix of Rawls
and Nozick in a way.

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:57.670
It's saying look, what matters
is that people aren't

00:21:57.670 --> 00:22:00.790
starving, that they have decent
shelter, decent health

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:03.060
care, et cetera, you can
define your minimum.

00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:07.570
But once you've defined a
minimum, we shouldn't care

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:09.520
about how rich people get
beyond that minimum.

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:16.180
So basically, the key thing is
that we should not care--

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:18.690
what commodity egalitarianism
focuses on, the insight it

00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:21.390
brings, which is an important
one, is it's not clear why

00:22:21.390 --> 00:22:22.780
relative should matter.

00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.740
What should matter
is absolute.

00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:26.040
It's not clear why I should
care how much

00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.770
richer I am than you.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:30.010
We should just care that you
have enough to live a decent,

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:31.420
socially acceptable life.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:35.290
And then if I want to get
rich, God bless me.

00:22:35.290 --> 00:22:38.490
So it's kind of like saying we
care about the minimum, but

00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:40.270
it's not all we care about.

00:22:40.270 --> 00:22:42.420
We care about making sure
there's a minimum decent

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.060
standard of living, defined
however you want to do it.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:46.100
Different people choose choose
different things.

00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:47.965
For some people, it's just
food and shelter.

00:22:47.965 --> 00:22:50.170
Other people could include
health care, or clothing, or

00:22:50.170 --> 00:22:51.330
other things.

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:53.230
I'm not saying what the
right minimum is.

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.500
Let's define some minimum, and
then say beyond that if guys

00:22:56.500 --> 00:22:57.940
get rich, God bless them.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:01.680
That's their prerogative, as
long as the poor people have

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.870
enough to survive.

00:23:03.870 --> 00:23:06.490
And this is an incredibly
interesting, compelling view,

00:23:06.490 --> 00:23:08.680
because it's a radically
different view, which says

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:11.480
relatives don't matter,
absolutes are all that matter.

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:13.655
All they're making sure is that
the absolutely people at

00:23:13.655 --> 00:23:17.490
the bottom have a decent
standard of living.

00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:20.980
And that's a very different
view as well.

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:25.750
So basically, social welfare,
when we talked about utility

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.595
functions, I didn't really talk
much, I just said, you

00:23:27.595 --> 00:23:28.970
write down a utility function,
we often use

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:30.790
square root of c, whatever.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:32.530
I didn't really talk much about
the form, I just said it

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:34.250
should have diminishing
marginal utility, and

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:36.470
otherwise I said sort
of all bets are off.

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:39.450
With social welfare functions,
it's a lot more open-ended and

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.520
a lot harder, and we don't
even really know what the

00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.790
right standards are.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:48.090
But it's just saying that we
can't get away from asking

00:23:48.090 --> 00:23:49.540
this awkward question.

00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:51.960
Because ultimately society does
end up with an unequal

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:55.040
distribution of resources, and
given that, we can't get away

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.180
from asking the question of
how do we feel about that?

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.960
Economics is about asking
uncomfortable questions.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.330
And this is an uncomfortable
question we have to answer,

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:06.150
which is how do we feel
about different

00:24:06.150 --> 00:24:08.400
distribution of income.

00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:09.690
And the reason this
is an issue--

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:10.030
Yeah?

00:24:10.030 --> 00:24:11.280
AUDIENCE: [UNINTELLIGIBLE]

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.050
PROFESSOR: That's a
great question.

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.270
I don't know.

00:24:18.270 --> 00:24:19.730
I wouldn't ask you
to write it down.

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.930
I mean, it's a much more
complicated-- there's not a

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:23.550
simple mathematical function
with your Nozick

00:24:23.550 --> 00:24:24.850
or commodity egal.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:26.300
Commodity egalitarianism,
I guess the

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.330
function would be that--

00:24:28.330 --> 00:24:31.300
the social welfare function
would be that there's some

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.520
minimum u bar.

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.960
Below u bar, we have an infinite
weight on you in our

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.900
social welfare function.

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.810
But once you get to u bar, we
only care about you the same

00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:42.060
as everybody else.

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:43.810
That would be sort of commodity
egalitarianism.

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:47.550
Nozick, I don't know how you
write it down mathematically.

00:24:47.550 --> 00:24:48.860
Why does this matter?

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:51.670
This matters because it turns
out in society we do have a

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:53.870
very unequal distribution
of resources.

00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:58.320
So to see that, let's go to the
next page, figure 23-2,

00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.860
this is from my textbook
that I use for my

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.420
course on public policy.

00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:06.920
And this shows the income
received by

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.010
quintile in the US.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.650
Let me explain what
this table means.

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:13.910
Each row is a fifth
of the population.

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:16.900
If we had an equal distribution
of income, then

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.530
each of these numbers
would be 20%.

00:25:19.530 --> 00:25:22.100
Each fifth of the population
would have a

00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:24.310
fifth of the income.

00:25:24.310 --> 00:25:25.630
But that's not true.

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:30.850
So if you look at 1967, the
poorest 20% of people only

00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.440
earned 4% of the income.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.710
And the richest 20% of people
earned 44% of the income, or

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:41.200
11 times as much, 43.8, about
11 times as much.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.780
That's an unequal distribution
of income.

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.600
What's interesting is
you can see over

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.530
time how it's changed.

00:25:47.530 --> 00:25:50.090
From 1967 to 1980, things
actually got

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.740
a little more equal.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.380
The poorest share actually grew,
and the richest share

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.290
fell a bit.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:59.120
Then this since 1980, things
have gotten a lot more

00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:04.180
unequal, to the point where in
2007, the poorest 20% of

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:06.470
people only controlled 3.4%
of our resources.

00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:11.050
That is, 1/33 of all resources
in society go to the bottom

00:26:11.050 --> 00:26:14.810
20% of the income distribution,
whereas 1/2 go

00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:16.450
to the top 20% of the
income distribution.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:20.420
So the richest 20% of people
get half the income that's

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:21.110
earned in the US.

00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:24.660
The poorest 20% of people get
1/33 of the income that's

00:26:24.660 --> 00:26:26.010
earned in the US.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:28.350
So this is why this stuff
matters, because there is

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:30.840
inequality in practice.

00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:33.050
In fact, it matters a lot in the
US in particular because

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:34.970
the next table shows how
we do relative to

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:36.900
the rest of the world.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.280
So this compares us to what's
called the OECD countries.

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.540
OECD is the organization for
economically something

00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:43.820
something, it's a
French acronym.

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.510
And basically, it's sort of
close to developed countries.

00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:50.400
It's a first and second
world if you will.

00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:54.710
It's different years because
the data is collected at

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:55.420
different frequencies.

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:58.010
But the rough facts are
constant over time.

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:01.510
This shows the share of income
in each of the quintiles

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:04.200
across all this list
of countries.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.450
And the bottom next to last
row shows the unweighted

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:11.740
average across these developed
countries compared to the US.

00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:15.240
What you see is we are the
second most unequal nation on

00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:18.030
this list other than Mexico.

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.500
We are more unequal than any
other nation on this list. On

00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.380
average, the poorest 20% of
society has more than twice as

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:29.740
much in other countries, whereas
the richest 20% has

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:33.130
about 20% less, 40% of the
resources instead of 50% of

00:27:33.130 --> 00:27:35.580
the resources.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:38.100
And so what you see is we
have a much more unequal

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.650
distribution of income than any
other major economy except

00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:43.900
for Mexico.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:50.230
So basically, this says we have
an incredibly unequal

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:54.320
distribution in American society
by some absolute

00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:56.930
standard, just if you look at
the numbers, it seems unequal,

00:27:56.930 --> 00:27:59.820
and relative to the
rest of the world.

00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.890
No country in history has ever
had all these numbers be 20%.

00:28:02.890 --> 00:28:04.780
Societies are always
unequal, the

00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:06.200
question is just how unequal.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.310
And compared to the rest of the
world at least, we seem

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:11.000
pretty unequal.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.740
So that says that under a
utilitarian function, or

00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:17.730
especially in a Rawlsian
function, we should worry that

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.750
we're not maximizing
social welfare.

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:25.340
Under a utilitarian social
welfare function, at least,

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.200
it's going to be hard to think
whether it maximizes social

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.470
welfare when there's
such an unequal

00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:31.140
distribution of resources.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:33.030
Certainly in a Rawlsian
function we're not.

00:28:33.030 --> 00:28:35.510
Nozick, who the hell knows.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.780
That depends on where we start
with opportunities, how much

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:41.620
is due to choice and how
much is due to luck.

00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.570
But of course, this doesn't
speak at all to the last view,

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.910
which is a commodity
egalitarianism view, which

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.840
says none of this matters.

00:28:49.840 --> 00:28:51.860
All that matters is the
measure of absolute

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.270
deprivation.

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:55.950
And we have such a measure in
the US, it's called the

00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:57.200
poverty line.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.510
The poverty line is a concept
that was actually thought up

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:08.040
by the mid-level government
bureaucrat in the 1960s.

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:11.500
What this woman, Molly
Orshansky, did is she said

00:29:11.500 --> 00:29:14.890
look, the typical family in the
US spends about a third of

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:17.470
their income on food.

00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:20.230
Let's figure out what a
minimally nutritionally

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.600
adequate diet costs.

00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.010
That is, how much do you have
to spend on food to have at

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.250
least a minimally
adequate diet.

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:30.320
No Starbucks, no Outback
Steakhouse, just enough to

00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.490
actually have a nutritionally
adequate diet, and then let's

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:35.790
multiply it by three, and we'll
call that what a family

00:29:35.790 --> 00:29:37.650
needs to live in the US.

00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:40.550
Food's typically a third of
consumption, let's figure out

00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.850
a minimally adequate diet,
multiply it by three, call it

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:45.280
the poverty line.

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:48.300
And basically, we've taken
this exercise and

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.210
used it ever since.

00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:53.150
We simply update it by inflation
to see how the

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:56.450
poverty line changes
over time.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:58.600
So basically, we've just taken
this concept and updated it by

00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.390
inflation over time.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:04.190
The result of what you get
is in figure 23-4.

00:30:04.190 --> 00:30:07.740
This shows the US poverty
line in 2006.

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.840
Actually, this is mislabeled,
it's 2009 actually.

00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.980
It's a typo in my book.

00:30:13.980 --> 00:30:18.610
What this says is that for a
family of one, the minimum

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:24.240
standard that you need
to live is $10,830.

00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.450
And it goes up with family size
because more people need

00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:28.090
more to eat.

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:32.960
Now, if you are from Mississippi
or maybe North

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:36.280
Dakota, this might look like
kind of a reasonably large

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.270
number to you.

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:39.725
If you're from Boston, this
looks like insane, like how

00:30:39.725 --> 00:30:43.335
could someone live on $10,830 a
year in Boston, New York, or

00:30:43.335 --> 00:30:45.960
DC, or San Francisco,
or any major city?

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.740
And the answer is they can't.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:51.060
The answer is that the poverty
line has not been kept up

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:54.120
appropriately, because we've
simply taken this number and

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.820
inflated it by inflation over
time, but it hasn't accounted

00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:58.110
for the fact that people's
consumption

00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.290
bundles have changed.

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:02.190
In particular, food is no longer
a third of the typical

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.230
person's consumption bundle,
it's now 1/6.

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.170
So in fact, the poverty line
should be much, much higher

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.020
than it is, but it hasn't been
updated over time in a

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.340
meaningful way.

00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:14.620
So you can think this is a very
low minimum standard for

00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.790
what people need to live, and
certainly below what anyone

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.590
needs to live in any major
metropolitan area.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.220
That said, we can look at what's
happened to the share

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.870
of population in poverty, and
that's in figure 23-5.

00:31:26.870 --> 00:31:28.890
So here's the sort of commodity
egalitarianism thing

00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.410
to look at, which is what's
happened to poverty.

00:31:32.410 --> 00:31:34.880
And what you see is there was
a massive decline in poverty

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:38.130
for everyone in the 1960s
to early '70s.

00:31:38.130 --> 00:31:41.560
We call this the War On Poverty
under the Kennedy and

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:46.100
Johnson administrations, a huge
reduction in poverty.

00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:50.780
What you see is that since about
1970, that reduction has

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.270
continued for one group, for
the elderly, their poverty

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:54.430
rates continued to fall.

00:31:54.430 --> 00:31:58.960
So in 1959, 35% of elderly
people lived in poverty.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.480
Then through massive expanses of
a program we'll learn about

00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:05.640
in a couple of lectures called
Social Security, that fell, so

00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:08.480
that today, only about
10% of elderly

00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:10.020
people live in poverty.

00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.010
On the other hand, for everyone
else, and especially

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.000
for kids, it's basically
flattened out or increased

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.280
since 1970.

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:20.305
So basically, overall poverty
rate hit about 13% in 1970,

00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:22.210
and it's been pretty
flat since.

00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:25.440
For kids, it fell to about
15%, and it's been

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.220
bounced up and down.

00:32:26.220 --> 00:32:28.770
It's now back up to about 20%.

00:32:28.770 --> 00:32:32.850
So from a commodity
egalitarianism view, even if

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:36.060
we take the poverty line as a
minimum acceptable level,

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:38.740
there are currently about 40
million families in the US

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.420
living below poverty.

00:32:40.420 --> 00:32:43.710
40 million people, I'm sorry,
living below the poverty line.

00:32:43.710 --> 00:32:47.460
So even at this minimum
standard, we've got a failure

00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:48.620
of redistribution.

00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:51.460
We're not maximizing social
welfare given that we've got

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.410
40 million people living
below this standard.

00:32:55.410 --> 00:32:59.640
So based on whatever standard
you want to use, except the

00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:03.070
hard to evaluate Nozickian
standard, we're clearly not

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:04.810
maximizing social welfare
at the current

00:33:04.810 --> 00:33:06.240
distribution of income.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.170
We've got an incredibly unequal
distribution of

00:33:08.170 --> 00:33:10.460
income, and even if all we
care about is making sure

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:12.990
people have a decent standard of
living, we're also failing

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:15.680
on that standard for upwards
of 40 million people.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.940
For a more realistic poverty
line, it might be more like 60

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.410
or 70 million people.

00:33:20.410 --> 00:33:25.010
So clearly there is an argument
here for some income

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:28.310
redistribution, whatever your
social welfare function is.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:29.190
So we can write down--

00:33:29.190 --> 00:33:30.640
I'm not going to ask you to
write down mathematically

00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:32.750
social welfare function and
maximize it and solve for

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.340
outcomes and stuff like that,
but what I want to leave you

00:33:35.340 --> 00:33:37.890
with here is simply
two points.

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:42.560
First of all, there are lots of
reasons why we might want

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.720
income redistribution in society
under any of these

00:33:45.720 --> 00:33:47.360
alternatives.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:48.655
That's point one.

00:33:48.655 --> 00:33:51.870
Point 2 is our current
distribution of resources

00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:55.740
seems sufficiently unequal that
we likely do want some

00:33:55.740 --> 00:33:59.110
redistribution of resources
in society.

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:02.030
For most social welfare
functions you can write down,

00:34:02.030 --> 00:34:05.010
given the facts I've shown
you, we would not be

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.139
maximizing social welfare at
the current distribution of

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:09.389
income in society.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:13.150
I'm trying to couch this in
a way that doesn't make me

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:14.760
particularly lefty or righty.

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.520
I'm just trying to couch this
in a way which just draws on

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.300
the uncomfortable fact that we
have to talk about this.

00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:22.480
We have to talk about income
redistribution.

00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.929
The only way to do so is
to have some framework.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:27.510
I've given you four frameworks
and said under all of them, or

00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:30.980
at least most of them, we would
be uncomfortable with

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.159
the existing distribution
of income in society.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:35.409
Questions about that?

00:34:37.989 --> 00:34:40.040
So what do we do about that?

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:44.820
What do we do about the fact
that we have unequal

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:46.150
distribution of resources
in society?

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.989
Well, we redistribute.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:50.610
We say look, let's get out
Okun's bucket and start

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:52.710
carrying some money around.

00:34:52.710 --> 00:34:54.630
We don't like the fact that
there's people living in

00:34:54.630 --> 00:34:55.500
poverty who can't eat.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:56.989
We don't like the fact that
the poor have so much less

00:34:56.989 --> 00:34:58.090
than the rich.

00:34:58.090 --> 00:35:00.200
Let's start redistributing.

00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:04.550
Once you do that is you
have to recognize

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:06.720
the leak in the bucket.

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.320
And recognize there's a trade
off, that it's not so simple

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.000
as saying, fine, let's take from
the rich and give to the

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.130
poor, because there's a
leak in the bucket.

00:35:15.130 --> 00:35:18.040
And so that as we take from the
rich and give to the poor,

00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:21.560
we shrink the total size
of social welfare.

00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:24.760
And that gives a trade off.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:30.270
And in particular, there's two
sources of leakage that we

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:32.560
have to think about.

00:35:32.560 --> 00:35:35.870
The first source of leakage is
that when you tax a rich

00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:41.260
person to take their money away,
they work less hard.

00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:43.690
And when they work less hard,
there's less goods produced in

00:35:43.690 --> 00:35:47.360
society, and that
shrinks the pie.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.140
The other source of leakage
you have to think about is

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.790
that when you give money to
poor people, they may

00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:57.320
themselves quit their jobs to
qualify as poor so they can

00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:01.170
get the money, and that further
shrinks the pie.

00:36:01.170 --> 00:36:05.040
So both the taxing the rich and
the giving to the poor are

00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.670
sources of leakage
in the bucket.

00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:09.860
And that's a trade off with
dealing with these enormous

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:13.850
distributional problems
that I laid out.

00:36:13.850 --> 00:36:16.580
So let's just go through one
example, general example to

00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.650
make this point.

00:36:18.650 --> 00:36:23.820
Let's say we have a society
where everyone is equal, and

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:28.000
everyone earns a wage
of $20 an hour.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.160
Equal society, everyone's
equal in terms of their

00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:35.470
underlying preferences, and
everyone earns $20 an hour.

00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:39.750
But people work different
amounts of hours.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:41.620
Now they could work these
different amount of hours

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.860
because they're lazy,
Nozick might say.

00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:46.200
They could work these different
amount of hours

00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.450
because they just can't find
a job, or because they're

00:36:50.450 --> 00:36:53.610
disabled, or because they're not
skilled enough to work a

00:36:53.610 --> 00:36:54.520
full-time job.

00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:56.740
Whatever the reason is, we're
going to stay away from what

00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:57.410
that reason is.

00:36:57.410 --> 00:36:59.200
Although obviously, what the
reason is matters for these

00:36:59.200 --> 00:37:00.580
social welfare functions.

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:02.740
Let's just say we have a society
where everyone earns

00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.800
$20 an hour, but we have a
distribution on how many hours

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.460
people work.

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:13.560
And let's say that we want
to start with a commodity

00:37:13.560 --> 00:37:16.320
egalitarianism view, and say
we want to make sure that

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.410
everyone has enough to eat.

00:37:17.410 --> 00:37:22.790
We want to make sure that
everyone has at least $10,000.

00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:25.440
So we come in and we say look,
we're worried about this

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:27.420
distribution of resources
in society.

00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:32.430
We want to make sure everyone
has at least $10,000.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:33.696
So what we're going to
do is we're going to

00:37:33.696 --> 00:37:36.850
give everyone a transfer.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:43.240
And that transfer function is
going to be equal to the max

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:51.600
of 0 and $10,000 minus
your income.

00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:53.430
In other words, if your
income is 0, we're

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.860
going to give you $10,000.

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.960
If your income's $5,000, we're
going to give you $5,000.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.140
If you income is $9,999, we're
going to give you $1.

00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.450
Once your income is $10,000,
we give you nothing.

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:09.090
So this is very much like a
commodity egalitarianism view.

00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:11.203
We're going to bring
you up to 10,000.

00:38:11.203 --> 00:38:13.550
We're going to bring you up to
10,000, but once you're above

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:16.410
10,000, we don't
care about you.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:19.780
So this is much less radical
than the utilitarian solution.

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:20.900
This is just saying,
we're just going to

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:22.390
bring the poor up.

00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.640
We're just going to
deal with that.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:28.980
However, if we're going to have
this program, we've got

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:29.560
to pay for it.

00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:30.850
We've got to give money
to poor people,

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.010
where's that come from?

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:34.650
Let's say we finance the program
by taxing higher

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:36.080
income people.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.590
What we're going to say in
particular is we're going to

00:38:37.590 --> 00:38:39.840
have a tax rate tau--

00:38:39.840 --> 00:38:42.910
so regular t is transfers,
tau is taxes--

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:52.290
which is 0 if your income is
less than $20,000, and 20% if

00:38:52.290 --> 00:38:55.640
your income is greater than
$20,000, greater than or equal

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:56.970
to $20,000.

00:38:56.970 --> 00:38:58.380
So we're going to have
a tax schedule.

00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.840
We're not going to tax you if
you're less than $20,000.

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.820
But once you earn more than
$20,000, we're going to tax

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:06.220
you at 20%.

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.880
So this is our redistributive
scheme in society.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.760
This is our Okun's bucket.

00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:12.420
The rich put the money in.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.530
We tax them to get the money
to put in the bucket.

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:16.470
We bring it over and give it
to the poor in the form of

00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:18.490
bringing everybody
up to $10,000.

00:39:18.490 --> 00:39:20.550
That's our redistributive
scheme, the simplest possible

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:23.750
redistributive scheme.

00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:25.590
What does this do?

00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:29.990
Let's now go to figure 23-6.

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:31.380
Pretty complicated figure,
so let's walk

00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.840
through this slowly.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:39.630
We initially have a budget
constraint that runs from the

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:44.470
intercept at 40,000 on the
y-axis to the intercept of

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:45.590
2,000 on the x-axis.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:48.400
So the initial budget constraint
is the outer budget

00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.270
constraint here running from
40,000 on the y-axis all the

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:54.170
way down to 2,000
on the x-axis.

00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:57.250
That's because we have a
$20 hour an hour wage--

00:39:57.250 --> 00:39:58.080
I'm sorry, let me go back.

00:39:58.080 --> 00:40:01.000
This is a consumption leisure
trade off, like we do whatever

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.460
we do in labor supply.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.420
When we do labor supply, we do
consumption leisure trade off,

00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:07.530
so you're deciding
how hard to work.

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:09.340
How do you decide how
hard to work?

00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:13.340
You can do it by trading off
consumption and leisure.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.790
You can either take
2,000 hours of

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:17.750
leisure and consume nothing.

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:21.720
Or you could take zero leisure,
work 2,000 hours to

00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.600
consume $40,000.

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.110
That's your trade-off, or
combinations in between.

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:29.660
And we have three individuals,
A, B, and C. A is someone who

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:30.870
works very little.

00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:35.170
They take a lot of leisure and
have very low consumption.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:37.340
C is someone who works a lot.

00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:39.570
They have low leisure and
high consumption.

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.230
And B's in the middle.

00:40:42.230 --> 00:40:47.040
Basic labor leisure trade off,
questions about that?

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:51.650
Now, how does this new
government policy affect the

00:40:51.650 --> 00:40:52.850
budget constraint?

00:40:52.850 --> 00:40:54.410
Well, it affects
it in two ways.

00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:58.640
First of all, for those
above $20,000, we

00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.140
now lower their wage.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:04.560
Instead of taking home $20 hours
an hour, they're only

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.960
going to take home $16 an hour,
because we're taxing

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.950
them at 20%.

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:12.710
So for everyone above $20,000,
we shifted the budget

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:13.590
constraint in.

00:41:13.590 --> 00:41:17.240
We have lowered the
price of leisure.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:21.630
We've lowered the price of
leisure by taxing them.

00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:25.090
So we've shifted that budget
constraint in.

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:26.940
It's the same budget constraint
up to 20,000, but

00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.180
now it pivots, and at
20,000, you're now

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.570
on the lower segment.

00:41:30.570 --> 00:41:32.860
With a slope, you can write
there, the slope is $20 at the

00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:37.000
higher segment, it's only $16
for that lower segment.

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.610
That's the first change you've
made to the budget constraint.

00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.410
That's the tax part.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:47.450
The second change is that for
anyone with income below

00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:52.400
$10,000, we've now said no
matter how hard you work,

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.980
we're going to give
you $10,000.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:00.210
So now we've said, once your
leisure is 1,500 hours, or

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:04.450
your work is 500 hours, anywhere
to the right of that,

00:42:04.450 --> 00:42:09.060
your income is always $10,000
no matter how hard you work.

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.890
If you earn $5,000, your
income is $10,000.

00:42:11.890 --> 00:42:14.030
If you earn $1, your
income is $10,000.

00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:18.870
If you earn $9,999, your
income is $10,000.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:23.610
So the new budget constraint is
a flat segment starting at

00:42:23.610 --> 00:42:27.740
the intersection of 10,000 and
1,500 and moving all the way

00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.690
to the right.

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:34.290
That is, no matter how much
leisure you take, above 1,500

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:37.190
hours of leisure, your
consumption is always $10,000,

00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:39.050
so it's flat.

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:43.410
So the new budget constraint
is the inner segment above,

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:45.840
then the old budget constraint
from $20,000 to $10,000, and

00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:50.570
then a flat from point B to
point D. I'm sorry, not from B

00:42:50.570 --> 00:42:53.950
to D. Kill that last comment.

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:56.830
From the intersection of 10,000
and 1,500 all the way

00:42:56.830 --> 00:43:00.710
to the right, that's the
new budget constraint.

00:43:00.710 --> 00:43:01.910
Questions about that?

00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:03.220
This is very important.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.270
This is just an application to
understand how these things

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.580
affect budget constraints.

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:09.450
What does this do to
people's choices?

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:13.470
Well, for a person like
C, they are now

00:43:13.470 --> 00:43:14.670
taxed on their labor.

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:17.170
Person C doesn't care about the
welfare program, they're

00:43:17.170 --> 00:43:19.660
rich, they don't care about
this $10,000 thing.

00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:22.840
But they do care about the
fact they're now taxed.

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:26.780
Assuming substitution effects
dominate, the price of leisure

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:31.050
has fallen, so they choose more
leisure and less labor.

00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:36.850
So person C, who was at C moves
to point E, working less

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:40.060
assuming substitution effects
dominate, more

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.940
leisure, less labor.

00:43:42.940 --> 00:43:48.420
Person A, for them, this
is a no-brainer.

00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.880
They can have both more leisure
and more consumption

00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:55.370
by moving from point A to point
D. Under this new budget

00:43:55.370 --> 00:44:00.490
constraint, they used to have
about-- it's not labeled

00:44:00.490 --> 00:44:03.035
there-- but have about 1,700
hours of leisure and consume

00:44:03.035 --> 00:44:05.120
maybe $5,000.

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.050
Now they can have more leisure,
they can have 2,000

00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:08.930
hours of leisure and
consume $10,000.

00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:14.920
So they move to point D. They
work less hard as well.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.030
Person B, the way I've drawn
this, this is critical.

00:44:19.030 --> 00:44:23.160
The way I've drawn this, their
indifference curve cuts

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.580
through the horizontal segment
running from the old budget

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:29.470
constraint to point D. Why
is that important?

00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:32.950
Because that means that
there'll be a higher

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:36.180
difference curve out at point D,
because indifference curves

00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:37.400
can't cross.

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:39.970
So if their old indifference
curve cuts through that

00:44:39.970 --> 00:44:43.210
horizontal segment, it must
mean that they would be

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:47.020
happier out at point D.
They're giving up some

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.170
consumption.

00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:51.680
This isn't a no-brainer like
for A, but they get so much

00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:54.340
leisure it's worth it.

00:44:54.340 --> 00:44:57.210
So you could have drawn B, if
I'd drawn B higher up, their

00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.910
indifference curve wouldn't have
crossed this horizontal

00:44:58.910 --> 00:45:00.720
segment, and then they wouldn't
have wanted to move

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.370
out to point D.

00:45:02.370 --> 00:45:04.060
So for A, it's a no-brainer.

00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:05.890
they move to D. For B
it depends on their

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:06.290
indifference curve.

00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.670
Yeah?

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:09.611
AUDIENCE: For C, doesn't he
change to working harder and

00:45:09.611 --> 00:45:10.553
consuming less?

00:45:10.553 --> 00:45:13.850
Because he moves [INAUDIBLE],
so his leisure [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:17.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you're right.

00:45:17.870 --> 00:45:18.650
This is drawn wrong.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:19.950
You're right, we draw it so
that income effect is

00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:20.440
dominating.

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:21.180
Good point.

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:23.090
I'm sorry, that should
have been--

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.240
good catch.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.970
Point E should be to the
right of point C,

00:45:27.970 --> 00:45:29.280
that's a mistake here.

00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:30.750
We should have drawn it with
substitution effects

00:45:30.750 --> 00:45:31.560
dominating.

00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:33.660
That would have been more
leisure and less consumption.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:36.790
He get less consumption,
but he works more

00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:37.460
because of the tax.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:38.810
But you're right, that should
have been to the right of

00:45:38.810 --> 00:45:41.390
point C. Please correct that.

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:43.350
They should have been to the
right of point C. Substitution

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.950
effect should lead
him to earn less.

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:50.330
So he earns less, although once
again, it's ambiguous.

00:45:50.330 --> 00:45:53.090
A clearly works less,
that's unambiguous.

00:45:53.090 --> 00:45:54.900
And B, it depends on their
difference curves.

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.950
But the way we've drawn it here,
B works less-- in fact,

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:58.860
B works a ton less.

00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:04.510
B goes from taking maybe 1,400
hours of leisure to taking

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.040
2,000 hours of leisure.

00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.620
This is a huge change for B.

00:46:07.620 --> 00:46:11.170
What this means is this tax
and transfer system has

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:16.310
massively reduced the amount of
labor supplied in society.

00:46:16.310 --> 00:46:17.115
Why do we care?

00:46:17.115 --> 00:46:22.160
Go to figure 23-7.

00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:24.680
We care because we
initially were in

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.150
equilibrium at point e1.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:32.560
But when people work less hard,
that's a shift inward in

00:46:32.560 --> 00:46:37.410
the labor supply curve that
reduces the total amount of

00:46:37.410 --> 00:46:41.110
labor supplied and causes
a dead weight loss.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:44.910
We've distorted the economy by
people working less hard.

00:46:44.910 --> 00:46:46.950
Trades that would've
made both parties

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:50.240
better off are not happening.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.810
Trades that would have made both
parties better off are

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:53.520
not happening.

00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:56.430
We've distorted the economy and
caused a dead weight loss.

00:46:56.430 --> 00:46:58.580
And that is the equity
efficiency

00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:02.360
trade off in a nutshell.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.990
The equity efficiency trade off
is we knew we wanted this

00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.990
tax and transfer system.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.940
We were very upset about
the number of

00:47:07.940 --> 00:47:09.550
people living in poverty.

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:13.120
But by putting this in, we've
caused a dead weight loss,

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.750
because it caused the rich
people to work less hard and

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:17.290
the poor people to
work less hard.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:20.680
There's leaks in the bucket
on both sides.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.310
This dead weight loss triangle
is the leak in the bucket, the

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:29.070
social waste that comes from
this redistribution system.

00:47:29.070 --> 00:47:32.020
Questions about that?

00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:37.170
So that leads us to mask,
was it worth it?

00:47:37.170 --> 00:47:40.640
Is a transfer system
like this worth it?

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:42.510
Well, there's a simple answer.

00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:44.330
You solve the social
welfare function.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:45.490
Once again putting
Nozick aside, we

00:47:45.490 --> 00:47:46.960
can't write that down.

00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:51.643
But if you're utilitarian, you
just solve it, because, in

00:47:51.643 --> 00:47:53.130
other words, what you say
is look, two things

00:47:53.130 --> 00:47:54.770
are going on here.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:57.410
Everyone's utility is
falling because

00:47:57.410 --> 00:47:58.490
there's a social waste.

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:03.420
So each of those u's goes down,
but the rich u's go down

00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.470
a little bit, and the poor
u's go up a lot.

00:48:06.470 --> 00:48:07.700
And you have to basically
ask which of

00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:09.500
those effects are bigger.

00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:11.220
In other words, if the dead
weight loss triangle is very

00:48:11.220 --> 00:48:13.290
small, then clearly--

00:48:13.290 --> 00:48:15.170
or if there's a small
leak in the bucket--

00:48:15.170 --> 00:48:17.350
then clearly, total utilitarian
social welfare

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:19.780
will go up with a scheme like
this, because the poor people

00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:21.600
will be made so much happier,
and the other

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.350
people won't care much.

00:48:23.350 --> 00:48:26.010
But if that dead weight loss
triangle is huge, let's

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:29.050
imagine half of society's output
disappears for this

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:31.370
transfer system, well, then
probably social welfare will

00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:34.500
fall, because so many people are
made sadder that the fact

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.900
a few poor people are made
happier isn't worth it.

00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.950
Remember, 40 million people are
in poverty, that means 300

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.070
million people aren't.

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:43.430
So if 300 million people, if
they see their incomes cut in

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:46.020
half so that 40 million people
can see their incomes raised

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.970
some, for most utilitarian
social welfare functions, that

00:48:49.970 --> 00:48:51.470
won't be a good deal.

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:54.110
So basically, we can literally
mathematically represent

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:59.130
whether this transfer was a
good thing or not by using

00:48:59.130 --> 00:49:01.230
this social welfare function
to evaluate it.

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.020
Under a Rawlsian function,
we know the answer.

00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.096
We know this is a good thing,
because Rawls doesn't care if

00:49:06.096 --> 00:49:08.210
we destroy all of society,
as long as that bottom

00:49:08.210 --> 00:49:10.240
guy gets pulled up.

00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:14.110
So basically, Rawls we know that
this is a good answer.

00:49:14.110 --> 00:49:17.520
Utilitarian, we don't know.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.840
That's going to depend on the
loss to the rest of us from a

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:23.120
smaller pie versus the
gain to the poor from

00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:25.370
getting more resources.

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:27.240
Questions about that?

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:29.870
All right, what we'll do is
we'll come back next time, and

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:33.440
we'll talk about what is the
government actually do to

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.260
actually affect redistribution
in society,

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:36.510
and how does it look?

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.480
We will now introduce a
new kinematic quantity

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.260
called angular momentum.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.960
Angular momentum
will be very useful

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.910
when we describe the
rotation and objects.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.250
In particular, how will
it be related to torque.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.110
Now, what is angular momentum?

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.740
Suppose we have an
object of mass m.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.380
And it's moving
in this direction.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.140
And it has momentum p.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.510
Remember, p equals mv.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.770
Angular momentum is always
defined about some point.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.310
So suppose we choose a
point s, and I wanted

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.020
to find the angular
momentum about

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.180
s due to this motion
of the object.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.920
And the way it's defined is I'll
draw a vector from the point

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.410
s to where the object is.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.320
And our definition of angular
momentum about s is equal--

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.690
this is three lines
for our definition--

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.950
it's the vector cross
product of the vector rs.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.650
We have the vector p.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.890
Now, how do we define the
direction of this vector?

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.400
Well, the way we do
that for any vector

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.860
product is we take
the two vectors

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.820
and we put them tail to tail.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.080
So let's start off
by drawing the vector

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.560
rs in that direction.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.070
And now when you
take a cross product,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.160
we draw an arrow from the
first vector to the second one.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.400
Remember, cross in vector
products are the same thing.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.800
And now we want to
use our right hand

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.259
rule to get the direction
of the angular momentum.

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.170
So we curl our fingers.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.420
And notice in this
case, it's pointing

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.150
into the plane of the figure.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.620
And so the direction of the
angular momentum about s

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.170
is given into the plane of
the figure in our light board.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.479
Now, we'll learn how to
calculate this cross product

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:54.470
in detail.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.810
But suppose we have
our vectors which

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.300
are in a slightly
different arrangement

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.400
as seen in this figure here.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.570
Well, what we see is with the
vector p and the vector rs,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.180
we still use our right
hand rule to calculate

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.978
the direction of Ls.

00:02:09.978 --> 00:02:12.860
Notice, whenever you have
a vector cross product,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.150
that the vector Ls is
perpendicular to both

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:23.840
the vectors rs and is
perpendicular to the vector p.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.150
And you can see in
both of these examples

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.420
that the angular momentum is
perpendicular to the plane

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.826
formed by the vectors rs and p.

DAVID THORBURN: Good
evening, people.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.770
We continue our
discussion of neorealism

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.360
by looking closely tonight
at one classic instance

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.160
of the neorealist
movement, the single most

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.920
famous film from that
school, Bicycle Thieves.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.190
Before I turn to talking a
bit about aspects of Bicycle

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.270
Thieves itself, which
I hope will frame

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.340
your viewing in a way that
will help you get a lot out

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.240
of the first
viewing of the film,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.720
I want to say a few words
about Vittorio De Sica himself.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.050
I mentioned this afternoon
that the neorealist movement,

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.620
although it was
immensely influential

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:08.600
and continues to be influential,
in fact, on realist filmmakers

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.930
and on documentarians, and it
was especially in its earliest

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:20.000
phases, hailed globally as
a very remarkable movement,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.320
it incited criticism almost
from the beginning inside Italy.

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.510
And I suggested
it this afternoon

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.590
that some complaints
against movie

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.960
essentially came from
conservative forces

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.610
in the society that felt
that the portrait of decay

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.140
and breakdown and
dislocation that

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.890
was at the center of neorealist
films-- after all, they

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.430
were about the
contemporary world

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:48.200
and about the broken universe,
the broken planet, at least

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.330
a broken Europe that we
encountered after the war.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.080
There were many kinds of
conservatives in Italy

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.010
who felt that it promulgated a
bad image for the society, that

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.390
made investment more difficult,
that it was a kind of downer.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.350
And this criticism
was very powerful.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.960
But what really
undermined the movement

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.770
in terms of getting financing,
the reason that the movement

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.480
sort of ended after
about the time Umberto

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:20.060
D, the last of the
truly neorealist films

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.020
that De Sica made,
was produced in 1952.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.474
It's life was very, very brief.

00:02:26.474 --> 00:02:28.640
Many people would say that
was the end of neorealism

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.056
although there are
some films that

00:02:30.056 --> 00:02:34.300
come after that have neorealist
dimensions and elements in them

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.020
including some by Fellini.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.400
Still the idea that the
movement had a very short life

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.247
despite its immense influences
it is an accurate one.

00:02:42.247 --> 00:02:43.830
But what I had left
out this afternoon

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.930
is an important
qualification or addition

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.020
which is that the films
also incited criticism

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.625
from the left.

00:02:52.212 --> 00:02:53.670
When you see Bicycle
Thieves you'll

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.410
see why that might
be a surprising fact,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.670
because the
sympathies of the film

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.060
are so totally on the side
of the underprivileged

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.130
and the underclasses
of the culture.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.320
It's difficult from our
contemporary vantage point

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.850
to see what would've
offended leftists.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.310
But there was a very
vigorous and theoretically

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.020
sophisticated communist
movement in Italy in this period

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.790
as there continues to
be today in some degree.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.860
And many people on the
left, especially communists,

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.400
but socialists as
well, also complained

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.380
about neorealist films.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.010
In particular about
De Sica's films

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.080
because their
complaint was not that

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.280
the difficulties of the
World War were exposed.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.410
They were perfectly
happy with that.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:43.951
But they were angry
that there wasn't

00:03:43.951 --> 00:03:45.060
a program for renovation.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.434
What they were
really angry about

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:49.880
was that there wasn't a Marxist
or a socialist program built

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.270
into the films.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.410
And it's always struck me as a
very revealing and interesting

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.020
fact about the movement that
it couldn't satisfy either left

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.890
or right, even though
these films are

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.250
among the most powerful
and compassionate films

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.990
about the lives of ordinary--
not just ordinary people,

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.910
but people without power,
of people without control

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.930
over their lives that
have ever been made.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.310
So it's a curious fact.

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.050
It bothered De Sica
all his life that he

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:24.580
seemed unable to
please either side

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.950
in that political argument.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:32.680
And at one point in an
interview he said something--

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.880
if I could find my notes,
I'd like to quote to you.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.274
He said in response
to a question

00:04:38.274 --> 00:04:40.190
that asked him why do
you think the socialists

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.150
and the communists were
somewhat-- or at least

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.120
some socialists, so
remember Zavattini

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.665
was a socialist, so he
collaborated deeply and loved

00:04:47.665 --> 00:04:50.560
De Sica and collaborated with
him on his most important film.

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.940
So I don't mean that all
socialists thought ill

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.040
of neorealism.

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.720
They did not.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.986
But some did and certainly
people on the far left

00:04:57.986 --> 00:04:58.610
definitely did.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.820
And here was De Sica's
response to why-- he expressed

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.310
disappointment about this.

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.540
But his response really
in a way is a critique

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.680
of the programmatic
demands that these people

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.190
were making on his films.

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.710
He said, "My films are a
struggle against the absence

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.970
of human solidarity."

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.800
You should think
about this quotation

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.670
as you're watching tonight's
film because as you'll

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.850
see in the film, the official
institutions of the society

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.470
seem to have broken
down or at least

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.890
to have become not effective.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.630
They're overburdened.

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.590
They're somewhat indifferent.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.090
It's mostly that
there overburdened,

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.900
that the problems
of the society are

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.430
too great for the
institutional structures that

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.540
are in place to
handle the problems.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:49.610
But in any case as
you're watching the film,

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.710
I think you'll notice
not only that clearly

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.280
this breakdown of
institutions are

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.090
very-- that we
might expect to be

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.440
helpful to Ricci in his quest.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.130
But what we will
also discover is

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.400
that there are other
forms of solidarity

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.740
that emerge in the film.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.210
One of them is the solidarity
of husband and wife.

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.230
Another is the solidarity
very much tested in the film.

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.150
It's the great central theme
of the film, the solidarity

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:13.570
of father and son.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:15.180
And then there's
also the solidarity

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:17.640
of what we might call
neighbors or neighborhoods.

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.380
And you'll see how
that element works

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.280
toward the end of the film in
its remarkable and surprising

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.470
conclusion.

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.810
Now here's the quotation.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.920
"My films are a struggle
against the absence

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.700
of human solidarity against
the indifference of society

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.510
towards suffering.

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.820
They are a word in favor of
the poor and the unhappy."

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.870
One reason I like the
statement is it so,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:43.630
in a certain sense,
unsystematic.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:46.980
It shows-- they seem to me
to be the words of an artist

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:48.900
not a political pamphleteer.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:53.090
And they partly explain the
richness, the resonance,

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:55.640
what I've been calling the
multiplicity of Bicycle

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.760
Thieves.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:00.380
There's a moment
in Bicycle Thieves

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.210
about which Andre Bazin has
written very beautifully.

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:06.920
The same critic
that was a champion

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:11.790
of French poetic realism and
of genre and of war of course

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.390
becomes one of the
great champions

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.740
of Italian neorealism.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.060
He can see that the
Italian form of realism

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.890
is an extension and
elaboration and in some ways

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:25.260
a deepening of the
implications of poetic realism.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.850
He's written brilliantly
about the neorealists

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.430
and especially about De Sica.

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.030
There's one place in the
film that he particularly

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.010
focuses on one of his essays.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:43.590
It's-- I have to give away a
small part of the plot in order

00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:46.285
to explain this but it
really won't trouble you

00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:49.982
because the plot engine gets
going so early in the film that

00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:50.940
it's hardly a surprise.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.190
In fact, you really know
what's going to happen almost

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:54.930
from the opening
dialogue in the film

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:57.400
where people are arguing
about who has bicycles

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.180
and who does not.

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.120
The film is organized in a very
elegant, relatively simple way.

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.600
It covers essentially
three days of time.

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.320
The first day is the
day in which Ricci gets

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.920
the commission for the job.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:24.192
And then goes with his wife
to get his bicycle out a hock.

00:08:24.192 --> 00:08:25.650
And you'll see that
they have to go

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:30.260
through certain kinds of tricks
to find the money to do this.

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.679
And then once he has his
bicycle he goes to work.

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:37.110
On his first day of
work, guess what happens?

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.630
Someone guess who
hasn't seen the film.

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:41.230
What do you think
might get stolen?

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.460
OK, right.

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:45.060
His bicycle is stolen on
the first day of work.

00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:46.970
Now the fact is
you're really not

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.770
surprised when it
happens because almost

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.270
from that first scene you're
aware that bicycles are

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:53.220
this incredibly precious
object in the world

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.020
and yet also incredibly common.

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:58.810
And that's part of why it's such
a resonant symbol in the film.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.830
But there at the
center of the film,

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:05.750
the most fundamental and most
memorable parts of the film

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:08.009
involve what I'll call
sort of the third segment.

00:09:08.009 --> 00:09:09.800
I don't know that the
segments are actually

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.320
equal in proportion
in terms of time.

00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.430
I think the third
is the longer one.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.820
But the third sequence
is the Odyssey

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.010
or the quest in which
Ricci and his young son

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.720
embark upon in order
to recover his bicycle.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:27.270
So he spends the whole-- I think
he gets his job, gets his bike,

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:32.280
starts his job on Friday,
has as bike stolen on Friday.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.800
Or maybe it's on Saturday.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.710
But in any case, he then
gets his bike stolen.

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.180
He then asks for help
from various sources

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:43.910
and the following day
he spends the entire day

00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.800
walking through the city of Rome
looking for the thief trying

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.710
to find his bike.

00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.640
He actually finds
the thief as you'll

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.880
see in the grand
climax of the film.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:57.710
Although the thief turns out to
be as miserable and at least as

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:01.270
much without prospects
as poor Ricci himself.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.690
Something very
interesting happens

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.860
in that moment in the film
because your sympathies

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.350
shift in some way to
the thief in an odd way.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:10.130
And you watch as
his neighborhood

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.850
gathers around the
thief to protect him

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.210
in certain respects.

00:10:13.210 --> 00:10:16.300
So the heart of the
film is this search

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.230
that the father and the son
go on through the third day

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.160
of the plot looking
for the bicycle.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.850
As the day wears on, the father
becomes more and more nervous,

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.530
more and more uneasy, more
and more filled with anxiety.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:34.540
The bike seems to him the
solution to all difficulties.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.790
And sometimes the
son slows them down

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.840
and there are scenes in
which the father becomes

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.540
annoyed or angry
with the son but I'm

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:42.850
getting a bit ahead of myself.

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:44.080
So I won't repeat this again.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.910
But I'll come back to these
matters in the theme of fathers

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:48.610
and sons.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:51.720
In any case there's a moment in
this Odyssey where the father

00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.450
and son are engaged in
the search for the bicycle

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:57.668
when it's just after-- I think
it's exactly at the moment when

00:10:57.668 --> 00:10:59.167
there's a gigantic
downpour, they're

00:10:59.167 --> 00:11:01.690
caught in a terrible rainstorm.

00:11:01.690 --> 00:11:03.890
I think in fact the
rainstorm caused this.

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:06.140
The boy has to pee very badly.

00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.990
And so he interrupts
the quest to go and pee.

00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:11.190
I mean he has- you have
to go, you have to go.

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:13.700
But the father is so upset
that the boy has slowed

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.970
him down that the slaps him.

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:18.950
And you get a sense that
it's maybe the first moment

00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.830
that this man has
ever struck his son.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:26.690
It's a tremendously
fraught moment.

00:11:26.690 --> 00:11:29.400
This is how Bazin
talks about it.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:32.060
And this is why I
mention this moment now.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:36.130
It's a way of illustrating
this principle of texture

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.570
or openness to experience--
that's part of the De Sica's

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:41.140
vision of the world.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.070
He is a socially
conscious director

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:48.450
but he's not a programmatic or
a politically preachy director.

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.700
So Bazin focuses on that moment
I've just described to you.

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.546
He says, the boy needs to pee.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.960
A downpour interrupt the chase.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.180
Then he says quote, "The
events are not necessarily

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.470
signs of something of
the truth of which we

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.800
are to be convinced.

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.950
They all carry
their own weight."

00:12:06.950 --> 00:12:11.530
The rain, the need to pee,
the father's anger, right?

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.560
"They all carry
their own weight.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.460
Their complete uniqueness.

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:19.190
They all have," Bazin
so finely, "They all

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:24.290
have that ambiguity that
characterizes any fact."

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.400
When a film is able to
capture that ambiguity that

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.410
characterizes any fact,
it's a work of art.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.210
It can be programmatic
if it does that.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:36.290
And in fact the
moment I'm describing

00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.430
is really in some
sense, a version

00:12:38.430 --> 00:12:41.050
of what I've been calling
the neorealist counter plot.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:43.620
What constantly happens
in good neorealist films

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:45.790
and what happens again and
again the Bicycle Thief

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.620
is that the ongoing
quest for the bicycle

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:53.970
is retarded or interrupted
by various kinds of accident

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:57.450
disturbance, strange encounter.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:12:59.786
So that the search
for the bicycle

00:12:59.786 --> 00:13:01.410
becomes something
much larger than that

00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:05.950
and every particular moment in
the film has, as Bazin says,

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.040
its own uniqueness,
its own-- you

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.970
don't feel that anything is in
the film to further the plot

00:13:10.970 --> 00:13:13.890
or to illuminate the
character or to tell you

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:16.387
something about what political
attitudes you should have.

00:13:16.387 --> 00:13:18.470
Although by the time you're
finished with the film

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.580
you do have a very
coherent sense

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.170
of how the society
is breaking down,

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.800
of how people are
sustaining themselves,

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:27.420
about how difficult life
is in postwar Italy.

00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:30.650
You're aware of all
of these things.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:33.430
And aware of them with a
concreteness and the clarity

00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:35.760
that you wouldn't have if
you read an abstract essay.

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.890
You've seen them embodied in
a totally believable fiction.

00:13:39.890 --> 00:13:42.340
But what gives the fiction
it's authority, what gives it

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.460
its power is precisely
that you don't

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.004
feel you're watching a sermon.

00:13:46.004 --> 00:13:47.670
You don't feel you're
watching something

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:51.170
in which some political moralist
is beating you over the head

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:53.870
and telling you, oh you better
love this poor guy, you better.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:57.370
And in fact as the film goes on,
one of the things you discover

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.110
is that there are nasty or
bad sides to poor Ricci.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:04.370
We understand that he's driven
by economic anxiety that's

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.150
very deep and partly
and certainly mitigates

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:08.060
his behavior.

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.330
But he behaves crudely
and cruelly to his son,

00:14:11.330 --> 00:14:12.390
never intending to.

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.150
Then of course there are moments
when he recovers and tries

00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.262
to make up with his son.

00:14:16.262 --> 00:14:17.720
I'll come back to
this in a moment.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.240
So this passage from
Bazin also calls attention

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:24.960
to what I think of as a
signal feature in these films

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.910
and especially in
the Bicycle Thief,

00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:30.380
that power that any
moment in the film

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.250
has to express a kind
of complete uniqueness,

00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:38.740
the ambiguity that
characterizes reality itself.

00:14:38.740 --> 00:14:42.140
Well, what I'd
like to briefly do

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:47.900
is give you a partial account,
a modest account of De Sica's

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:50.620
own career and then
say some things

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:53.980
about the Bicycle Thieves.

00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:56.340
De Sica was a stage actor.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.150
He gave regimental performances
when he served in the Army

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:00.635
in the first World War.

00:15:00.635 --> 00:15:04.090
He became a stage hand right
after the war and an actor

00:15:04.090 --> 00:15:06.340
in 1923.

00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.370
He joined a theater company
in 1925, a touring company,

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:12.430
and he became a
tremendous success

00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:14.860
in a series of performances.

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:18.930
In 1927 he appeared
on stage in Rome

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.130
in something called
[? Sabun ?] Reviews

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.540
and I think it involved
singing and dancing.

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.770
This was an unbelievable
success and turned him

00:15:27.770 --> 00:15:34.020
into a kind of a matinee idle
or at least a theater icon.

00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:38.790
He made his first film in that
same year in 1922 as an actor.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:42.720
And his first success
came-- he continued

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.120
to act in films intermittently
for the next decade

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:48.180
but he didn't become a
recognizably serious film actor

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:53.420
until his first major
success in 1932.

00:15:53.420 --> 00:16:00.650
Then for 10 years, he's a kind
of matinee idle Italian movies.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:03.310
He made over 40
films in the period

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:07.530
as an actor between
1932 and 1942--

00:16:07.530 --> 00:16:10.810
a very handsome man as some of
you may know if you've seen him

00:16:10.810 --> 00:16:16.390
and capable of great
subtlety as an actor.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:19.290
This may help to explain why
he was such a great director

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:22.980
of nonprofessional actors,
because he knew intuitively

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.200
I think, how to bring
out the performance

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:30.790
from someone who was not trained
in performing, in acting.

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.930
He begins to direct
in 1940 and makes

00:16:34.930 --> 00:16:38.840
a series of moments in
interesting but forgettable

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.120
films I suppose.

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.110
His first really significant
film from one angle

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:46.050
anyway, especially if we're
interested in the development

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:52.340
of neorealism, is a film he
makes in 1942, co-screenwriter

00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:59.320
Cesare Zavattini, it's entitled
The Children Are Watching Us.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:01.610
It's-- I've seen the film.

00:17:01.610 --> 00:17:03.740
It's not a great film.

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:05.290
But it's an interesting film.

00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:07.819
And there are some
remarkable moments it.

00:17:07.819 --> 00:17:10.900
The title tells you something
about the neorealist commitment

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:16.420
to focus on the under
privileged and the dis-empowered

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:17.930
in society.

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:21.730
Many neorealist films
focused directly on children.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.569
And The Children Are
Watching Us is one such film.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:28.290
And it almost announces
the idea that children

00:17:28.290 --> 00:17:31.510
are among the victims of society
because they are subjected

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:34.310
not only to all the political
and social authorities

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.170
of the society, but
also to the arbitrary

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:41.040
authority of their own parents
and their own immediate family

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:41.540
environment.

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.720
So The Children Are
Watching Us announces

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:51.580
this interest in the
disenfranchised and especially

00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:53.110
in children.

00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:55.130
It's a film about the
breakup of a middle class

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:59.360
marriage mostly told through
the eyes of children.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.810
So there are certain
things, certain behaviors

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.270
on the part of the adults
are never fully explained

00:18:04.270 --> 00:18:06.330
because you witness
and experience

00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.290
the film through
not just the eyes

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:11.280
but through the perceptions
the understanding,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.367
the sensibility of children
who are somewhat confused

00:18:14.367 --> 00:18:15.450
about what they're seeing.

00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:26.300
The film that established him
as an international figure

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.650
and established neorealism
as an international movement

00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.750
was one that to De
Sica and Zavattini

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.480
collaborated on in 1946.

00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:35.725
It was entitled Shoeshine.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.240
I sometimes have been tempted to
show Shoeshine in this course,

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.130
even though it's a much less
perfect film than Bicycle

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.270
Thieves because in its own way,
it's so powerful and moving.

00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:51.900
One of the most interesting
things about neorealism,

00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:54.110
apart from the fact that
it was so short lived,

00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:57.140
is how relevant the
films still feel today.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.050
If you watched Shoeshine
or another of the films

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.570
that I've listed here
on Umberto D which

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:07.600
is about the problems
that people who have gone

00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.010
into-- of the old, people
who are retired, pensioners,

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:16.730
and the problems they face when
there is horrific inflation.

00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:19.900
De Sica dedicated the
film to his father.

00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.610
It's about an old man
who was very proud.

00:19:21.610 --> 00:19:23.570
He used to be-- he
dresses very well.

00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:25.000
But he's tremendously isolated.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.020
He's terribly poor.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.574
He's almost reduced to begging
in the course of the film.

00:19:28.574 --> 00:19:30.490
There's even a moment
near the end of the film

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:33.390
where he contemplates and
then pulls back from suicide.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.720
But watching that
film today, it feels

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.660
much less dated
than some films that

00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:46.470
are much later than-- were
produced 10, 15, 20, 25

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.680
years after it because
the theme is so relevant.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.160
Because we know that
in society today there

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.640
are so many-- in all
of a Western societies

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.350
but especially in
the United States--

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.152
there are pensioners who
can't make in ends meet.

00:20:00.152 --> 00:20:02.110
The same thing is true,
I think, in some degree

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.190
of the role of the fate of
children in modern society.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.700
So Shoeshine, although it has
a very melodramatic and violent

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.620
ending, it's an
immensely powerful film.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:15.160
Essentially it's a story about
two boys, two Roman street

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.180
urchins who are taking
advantage of in some sense

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:23.681
by their own relatives who are
trafficking in black market

00:20:23.681 --> 00:20:24.180
goods.

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:27.540
It's set in the same moment
at the end of the war.

00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:33.190
In fact, the film opens
with these urchins

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:34.940
trying to make a living
as shoeshine boys.

00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:37.270
That's why where the
title comes from.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.850
And these shoeshine boys are
wandering the streets of Rome,

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:43.220
going up to American soldiers
who are dominating the streets,

00:20:43.220 --> 00:20:47.234
it's still an occupied
city, asking soldiers

00:20:47.234 --> 00:20:48.275
if they want shoe shines.

00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:55.240
The children are
unbelievable victims.

00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:57.090
They're very close friends.

00:20:57.090 --> 00:21:01.000
They end up buying a racehorse,
a broken down old racehorse

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.620
that can't race anymore and
they stable it someplace.

00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:11.544
They are very excited about
their possession of this horse.

00:21:11.544 --> 00:21:12.960
There's some early
scenes in which

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.219
you see them riding on the
horse with tremendous joy

00:21:15.219 --> 00:21:15.760
and so forth.

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:19.980
But of course this is the dawn
before the miserable night.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.410
Because what then
happens is the kids

00:21:22.410 --> 00:21:26.260
are taken advantage of by one
their-- by a close relative.

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.670
They're involved in
black market activities.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:31.051
The adults use the
children because they

00:21:31.051 --> 00:21:33.050
know that children are
less vulnerable than they

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:34.175
would be if they're caught.

00:21:34.175 --> 00:21:35.860
The children are caught.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:37.590
They're sent to reform school.

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.810
Most of the film takes
place in the reform school.

00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:42.920
You see these two bright-eyed,
beautiful young children,

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:47.510
maybe 10 years old, who are the
fastest and closest of friends

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.830
when they go into jail,
slowly breaking down.

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.480
You see their humanity
being beaten out of them

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.630
by the conditions in the
reform-- in the children's

00:21:55.630 --> 00:21:57.580
prison.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:22:02.840
It's a terrible
disturbing film in part

00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.420
because you could see that
the people who are running

00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:09.900
the prison actually mean well.

00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:14.240
They're not vicious, evil people
who want to harm children.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:18.610
The system seems designed simply
to cause more harm than good

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:22.300
and to destroy the
vitality and optimism.

00:22:22.300 --> 00:22:24.510
And when I say the film
ends melodramatically,

00:22:24.510 --> 00:22:28.370
one child strikes out at
his erstwhile best friend

00:22:28.370 --> 00:22:30.420
and knocks him down
a bank and he dies.

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.190
So he in effect accidentally
murders a person who

00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:35.592
had been his dearest friend.

00:22:35.592 --> 00:22:37.050
I think it's a
failure in the film.

00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.383
I think that you didn't need
the murder for the meanings

00:22:39.383 --> 00:22:40.860
of the film to be available.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.990
I think that De Sica
learned something from that.

00:22:42.990 --> 00:22:45.277
When you watch the ending
of the Bicycle Thief,

00:22:45.277 --> 00:22:47.110
one of the things I
hope you'll ask yourself

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.020
is why is it so
apparently undramatic?

00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.280
And why does that
undramatic ending

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:57.040
in the end seems so profound,
so moving, so meaningful?

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.240
It's as if De Sica sort
of learned his lesson.

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.440
It's as if he drove his
point home too heavily

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.930
at the end of Shoeshine.

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:06.820
He realized that to have
a truly organic text that

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.710
did what Bazin wants text
to do, reflect the unique

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:14.790
the unique ambiguity
of every experience.

00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.360
The ending of the
Bicycle Thieves

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:20.060
does that much more effectively
as I hope you'll watch

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.080
for when you you're
watching the film.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.400
Shoeshine made a
tremendous impact

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.520
and it won the first
of four Academy Awards

00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:34.720
that De Sica won
as best director.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.090
This was for the best foreign
film of the year in 1946

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:39.550
and it put new
realism on the map.

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:51.280
Then two years later
Zavattini and De Sica

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:53.850
followed with what I suppose we
could call their masterpiece,

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:55.160
Bicycle Thieves.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.010
I want to say that this is not
a complete-- remotely complete

00:23:58.010 --> 00:23:59.080
list of De Sica's films.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.780
I've just listed
some highlights here

00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:03.830
because I wanted to give
you a sense of his work.

00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:07.030
I mentioned Umberto D already,
the last neorealist film

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:10.710
according to many people,
and a very moving one

00:24:10.710 --> 00:24:12.780
about an old pensioner.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.210
The film Two Women
stars Sophia Loren,

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:18.680
one of the great sort of
pulchritudinous Italian movie

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.870
stars of the '50s and '60s.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:23.450
It got a lot of attention.

00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:26.540
There were many other
interesting films that he made.

00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:29.390
But one of his great triumphs
was the very last we made.

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:31.020
That's what I want
to mention it.

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:38.940
Zavattini returned to do
an uncredited coscreenplay

00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:42.550
work on Finzi-Continis and
you can feel Zavattini's hand

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.310
in many moments in the film.

00:24:44.310 --> 00:24:47.030
It's an adaptation of a novel.

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:51.050
As some of you may know,
it's really a Holocaust film.

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.240
It's about the buildup
to the Holocaust.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:57.050
The Finzi-Continis are
very wealthy Italian Jews.

00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.890
The story is about a poor
young Jewish scholar who is,

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.620
because of the
anti-Jewish laws that

00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:06.990
are developing in
fascist Italy, is barred

00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:09.220
from using the public library.

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:10.860
He's a very gifted
young scholar.

00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:12.270
He's in his early '20s.

00:25:12.270 --> 00:25:16.680
So he finds out that this very
wealthy aristocratic family,

00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.470
also Jewish, the Finzi-Continis
have a magnificent library.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:22.660
The Finzi-Continis open
their library to him

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.670
since he's barred from going
into the public library.

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.405
Of course what happens is,
you might guess this too,

00:25:28.405 --> 00:25:31.030
it's a wonderful novel although
the film is even more beautiful

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:32.010
I think.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:34.730
He falls in love with the
Finzi-Continis' daughter.

00:25:34.730 --> 00:25:36.970
Right, so it's a class issue.

00:25:36.970 --> 00:25:38.730
The poor boy, rich girl.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:47.430
So the foreground of the film
is this cross class romance.

00:25:47.430 --> 00:25:49.630
But in the background
of the film

00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:53.722
it's something like cabaret but
not as dramatic, not as overt.

00:25:53.722 --> 00:25:55.930
Because what's going on in
the background of the film

00:25:55.930 --> 00:25:58.040
is the growth of fascism.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.750
The end of the film ends with
many of the characters we've

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:05.190
gotten to know very well, both
young and old, all of them

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:08.110
Jews, some very
aristocratic and some

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.180
at the bottom of the
social hierarchy,

00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.770
all being herded together
being ready to be shipped off

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:13.830
to the camps.

00:26:13.830 --> 00:26:16.430
You don't actually go-- the
final scenes of the film

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:19.960
have them in the railroad
station being prepared

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.570
for their final journey.

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:31.350
The film is also full of comedy,
just as some of the passages

00:26:31.350 --> 00:26:34.560
that I showed you in clips
from this afternoon mix comedy

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.280
with socially serious themes.

00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:40.790
This is even truer of The
Garden of the Finzi-Continis

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:43.090
One of the reasons I like
the film so much is that it's

00:26:43.090 --> 00:26:48.270
a return to the energies and the
moral passion that had marked

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:49.990
De Sica's earlier career.

00:26:49.990 --> 00:26:51.540
And I think that
my own feeling is

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:53.900
the The Garden of
the Finzi-Continis

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.370
is one of the great
European films.

00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:58.990
It certainly would be
on my list of the best

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:07.270
15 or 20 European
films of the sound era.

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:11.190
I think many of you would find
it very instructive and moving.

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:12.950
But I think especially
so after you

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:16.040
saw some of the truly neorealist
films, the early neorealist

00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:17.170
films.

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:19.440
One can't really call The
Garden of the Finzi-Continis

00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:23.190
a neorealist film although it
has many elements in common

00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.560
with those earlier texts.

00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.380
So De Sica was a remarkable
man, a significant actor,

00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:31.430
a great director.

00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:35.270
He directed 25
films in his career,

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:38.960
won four Oscars for
best foreign film.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.780
He acted in more than
150 films, mostly

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.690
light, comic social
matters kind of roles.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:50.030
But there's one exception
I perhaps should mention.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:52.510
Playing in a film
for his friend,

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:57.040
Roberto Rossellini in 1959,
Rossellini's greatest film,

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:03.660
a film called General Della
Rovere, De Sica plays the lead

00:28:03.660 --> 00:28:07.830
and it's probably his most
memorable performance.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:10.350
It's a very, very
subtle and good film

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:12.560
about political
ambiguities and conflicts

00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:17.450
of loyalty, human frailty,
and human inadequacies

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:21.210
in a way that's characteristic
of the best neorealist work.

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:24.320
So those are all films
I recommend or urge you

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:30.970
to consider watching
in your leisure time.

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.595
Let me say a few words
now about Bicycle Thieves.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.670
I've already implied
or actually said

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.660
a part of what I want to say so
what I think I can be briefer

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:44.340
than I had originally planned.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.129
Let me remind you again
about the structure.

00:28:47.129 --> 00:28:49.170
I mentioned to you that
the structure of the film

00:28:49.170 --> 00:28:52.720
is elegantly simple, that
the amount of time the passes

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.490
is very compressed.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:29:00.370
And that's helpful because
the time compression

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:03.580
makes you aware of the
urgency of the quest

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.750
that the father and the son
are engaged in when they're

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.160
searching for the bicycle.

00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:15.600
So one way-- and as the story
unfolds, a number of things

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:17.880
begin to happen.

00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.620
The quest for the bicycle
becomes a kind of Odyssey

00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:22.090
in which several things happen.

00:29:22.090 --> 00:29:25.890
One is the film takes you
on an exploration of Rome.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:27.930
It's like one of the
great city films.

00:29:27.930 --> 00:29:29.010
It visits the city.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:30.250
It explores the city.

00:29:30.250 --> 00:29:32.710
You see different--
it's not just that you

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:35.870
see police stations and
religious institutions

00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:38.080
and the catacombs
underneath the city.

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.910
Where the unions
meet, and where Ricci

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:44.380
first goes to get help from
Union members who promised him

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.169
that they'll find his
bike, very easily,

00:29:46.169 --> 00:29:48.085
and they give him a plan
and he's very excited

00:29:48.085 --> 00:29:49.580
and then the next
morning when they

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:53.230
follow the instructions of the
union, the boss doesn't help.

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:56.220
So the unions are breaking down
as well as the church, as well

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:59.110
as certain kinds of welfare
organizations in the state

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.812
and so on.

00:30:01.812 --> 00:30:04.270
So one thing the film becomes
then is a kind of travelogue,

00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:05.840
a kind of exploration
of the city,

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:10.790
the city's geography as well as
the city's make up in some way.

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:12.620
You go into different
neighborhoods

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:14.460
and you hear-- I
think Italians can

00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.780
pick up the different
neighborhoods

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.440
speech patterns in
the film, at least

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:21.910
I've been told this
made by native Italians.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:24.060
So it's a kind of
travelogue in one sense.

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.490
It explores this place.

00:30:26.490 --> 00:30:31.330
And part of the
exploration of course

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:38.970
involves certain
ancillary or other themes

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:45.280
that are organically linked
to the story of going

00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.240
through the city
looking for the bicycle.

00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.630
One of course is
what we might call

00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.010
the social themes of the film.

00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:56.760
Because as the
protagonists make their way

00:30:56.760 --> 00:31:00.540
through the city searching for
the bicycle what you encounter

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.890
are little vignettes
that tell you something

00:31:02.890 --> 00:31:07.930
about the social hierarchies of
the society, about the efficacy

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:10.790
or in efficacy of
its institutions.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:12.570
I won't go into
great detail here.

00:31:12.570 --> 00:31:14.360
I hope you'll draw
your own conclusions

00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:18.760
and name some of the
specific examples that

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.470
reinforce this general idea.

00:31:20.470 --> 00:31:23.560
But I do want to
mention at least

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:29.920
one moment in this Odyssey.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.500
One of the most dramatic
and disturbingly comic

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.920
moments in the film occurs
when Ricci and his son

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:40.530
actually think they've
seen the thief.

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:42.820
They think they recognize
him and they follow him.

00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.540
And they get to
essentially a mission

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:50.590
where relatively well-off,
self-satisfied Christians

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:54.950
are serving meals to the
indigent and the poor, right?

00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:58.120
Ricci gets into this institution
not because he sort of wants

00:31:58.120 --> 00:32:00.510
the meal or because he
needs the religious uplift

00:32:00.510 --> 00:32:02.930
but because he's
chasing his thief.

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.650
And he finds once he's in
there that he can't get.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:09.130
It turns out that in
this institution that

00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:14.070
not only do the poor have
to pay for their meal

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:18.440
by agreeing to all kinds of
religious behaviors, prayers,

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.730
and other kinds of things.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.240
But they're also locked
into the building.

00:32:21.240 --> 00:32:22.500
They're not allowed
eat, they're not

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:24.840
allowed to leave at least
until they finish eating.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.490
Maybe they're not
allowed to leave

00:32:26.490 --> 00:32:28.573
until they can be checked
to make sure they're not

00:32:28.573 --> 00:32:29.690
stealing the soup bowls.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.057
But in any case, it's a
very interesting moment

00:32:33.057 --> 00:32:34.890
because you can see
that even the people who

00:32:34.890 --> 00:32:36.630
would intend to
do well in society

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.870
often do more harm than good.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:40.830
And of course the
implication is that

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:42.500
the traditional
religious institutions

00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.050
and traditional
religious arrangements

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:48.665
are not sufficient
to take care of

00:32:48.665 --> 00:32:54.070
or adequately to respect the
difficulties of the poor.

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:55.830
That's just one such moment.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.785
There are number of others.

00:32:58.785 --> 00:33:00.160
In fact there is
one other moment

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.720
I should mention as
a kind of contrast.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.760
I've said that we see
many instances in which we

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.040
understand that the larger
institutions of society

00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:12.230
like the police or the religious
system or the union system

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:14.614
are breaking down or not
really helping people.

00:33:14.614 --> 00:33:16.280
But I will but I've
also said that there

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.510
are some other sort
of unofficial, and

00:33:18.510 --> 00:33:22.090
non-institutionalized sources
of solidarity and comfort

00:33:22.090 --> 00:33:24.000
that emerge in the
course of the film

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.060
and I hope you'll watch for
them and think about what

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:29.160
their significance is.

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:39.340
But there's one moment which
complicates this argument

00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:43.590
because we can see the social
institutions of society not

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:46.570
actually functioning
effectively but at least showing

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:47.840
some compassion.

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.070
It's an astonishingly
vivid, meaningful moment

00:33:51.070 --> 00:33:53.346
in the film, another one
of these moments so full

00:33:53.346 --> 00:33:57.080
of multiplicity that the
meanings are so deeply embedded

00:33:57.080 --> 00:34:00.120
in what you dramatically see
that sometimes you don't even

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:03.140
step back to generalize on the
meaning of what you've seen.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:05.660
This is a scene very
early in the film

00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:09.250
where Ricci actually goes
to retrieve his bicycle.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:14.750
His wife has figured out a way--
basically what she figures out

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:16.199
is they sell her dowry.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.949
She has a couple of
fancy silk sheets.

00:34:18.949 --> 00:34:22.350
They take them to the hockshop,
and they pawn the sheets

00:34:22.350 --> 00:34:25.070
in order to get enough money
to get the bicycle out of hock.

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.611
It means they're
going to be sleeping

00:34:26.611 --> 00:34:30.690
on mattresses and but so what,
this is more important right?

00:34:30.690 --> 00:34:35.170
You see Ricci and his wife go to
the pawn shop which is clearly

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:35.900
run by the state.

00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:38.250
Is not like a
private pawn-- it's

00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.840
obviously a city
institution of some kind.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:45.050
And they bring the linen up to
the guy and he looks at them

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:47.136
and he says, OK, I'll
give you this much money.

00:34:47.136 --> 00:34:48.969
And they need a little
bit more because they

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:52.600
need to get the bike out of hock
so they ask him for more money.

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:55.159
And he looks at it, he says,
oh, it's not really worth it

00:34:55.159 --> 00:34:55.810
but, OK.

00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:58.370
And it's an act of
generosity on his part

00:34:58.370 --> 00:34:59.745
because he didn't have to do it.

00:34:59.745 --> 00:35:02.612
He gives them just enough money
for this stuff so that they

00:35:02.612 --> 00:35:03.820
can get his bike out of hock.

00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.800
And then, completely silent, you
see him pick this material up,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.450
this pawned bedding,
this pawned linen,

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:13.810
and he turns around-- I think
he does-- he may give it

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:14.685
to another character.

00:35:14.685 --> 00:35:16.682
I haven't looked at
this scene a year or two

00:35:16.682 --> 00:35:19.140
so I don't remember the exact--
you'll recognize the scene.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:21.431
I think it's the same man
who does it or he may give it

00:35:21.431 --> 00:35:22.260
to someone else.

00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:24.845
The material-- the three or
four sheets that are involved

00:35:24.845 --> 00:35:25.720
are taken by someone.

00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:27.910
He walks to the back
of a room, and he

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.140
begins to climb a ladder.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:34.470
As he climbs you realize that
what he's climbing up is-- he's

00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:37.720
climbing a ladder
which is leaning

00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:41.520
against a series of shelves
that seem to go on endlessly.

00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.280
They seem to be in an
auditorium the size

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:46.250
of the city of Pittsburgh.

00:35:46.250 --> 00:35:50.300
And they go up endlessly
high and every single shelf,

00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:52.050
every single inch of
space on the shelf

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:55.750
is filled with bedding as
if the entire city of Rome

00:35:55.750 --> 00:35:59.950
has pawned its bedding,
as if everybody in Rome

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.494
is sleeping on mattresses.

00:36:01.494 --> 00:36:03.410
Now the film never makes
a comment about this.

00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:05.750
No one in the film
says anything about it.

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:08.600
But it's an unbelievably
resonant and rich moment.

00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.970
And it's also-- it
does further the sort

00:36:11.970 --> 00:36:13.660
of social themes of the film.

00:36:13.660 --> 00:36:15.930
But it occurs in a moment
in which you will also

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:20.280
see the pawn broker showing
a moment of compassion

00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.280
and generosity.

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.030
And if you did not
show that generosity

00:36:24.030 --> 00:36:26.080
they wouldn't have been
able to get the bicycle.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.860
So it's a complicated moment.

00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.910
But if all this linen
has been pawned,

00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:33.400
there's some question
about whether or not

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:36.380
the city services are doing
much good for anybody.

00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:38.180
The city's in obvious
trouble if nobody

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.930
has any bed linen any longer.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:44.130
The implication is this is
an unbelievably impoverished

00:36:44.130 --> 00:36:46.410
and damaged environment.

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:50.670
But it's done in such a quiet
way there's even something

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:53.090
almost comic about
the sense you have

00:36:53.090 --> 00:36:55.199
of the endless number
of these things.

00:36:55.199 --> 00:36:57.740
Even the idea that you have to
distinguish one from the other

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.080
seems from our vantage
point a bit silly,

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.760
even though each one
has a ticket on it,

00:37:01.760 --> 00:37:03.940
each one belongs to
an individual family.

00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:05.060
So watch for that moment.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:11.220
It has some of that ambiguity
that Bazin talks about.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.260
So the structure of the
film is organic in the sense

00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:16.150
that nothing that
happens in the film

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:18.249
doesn't seem to
arise naturally out

00:37:18.249 --> 00:37:19.540
of the needs of the characters.

00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.760
We have to find our new bike.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.950
And in the course of their
travels other things happen.

00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:26.702
The boy has to pee,
they get hungry.

00:37:26.702 --> 00:37:27.410
They have to eat.

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:30.030
Or sometimes it rains, they
have to get out of the rain.

00:37:30.030 --> 00:37:30.530
Right?

00:37:30.530 --> 00:37:33.310
And that becomes part
of the ongoing sort

00:37:33.310 --> 00:37:37.040
of organic development
of the story.

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:39.690
You never once feel,
I think, in this film

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:43.360
that any event has been
imposed from the outside.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.900
Every event seems
to arise naturally

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.720
out of the circumstances and
nature of the characters.

00:37:49.720 --> 00:37:51.440
And that's why I
call it organic.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:56.890
It's a deeply organic way of
thinking about the material.

00:37:56.890 --> 00:37:58.880
But it's organic in
another way too course

00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.349
because it's deeply coherent.

00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:02.640
When you finally finished
the film, when you step back,

00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:05.280
you say, OK, yes the
film slowed down here.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:08.350
And yes, the film seemed
to generate what Thorburn

00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.530
calls a counter plot here.

00:38:10.530 --> 00:38:12.330
Nonetheless, taken
as a whole, there's

00:38:12.330 --> 00:38:15.720
a profound moral and
thematic coherence

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:19.300
in this organically fluid movie.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.070
So the structure of the
film is part of its essence.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:24.090
And although I haven't
put this on the outline

00:38:24.090 --> 00:38:26.660
because we've talked about
this so often already,

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:30.380
pay attention to the Renoir-ish
type camera behavior.

00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:33.380
The film's visual style
is like Jean Renoir's.

00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:36.240
There's a kind of
elegant restlessness

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:42.140
to the camera that's very much a
part of what the film achieves.

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.810
So in talking about
the social themes

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:46.270
all I meant to
call your attention

00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:49.360
to was the extent to which
in a variety of ways,

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.210
the film calls attention
to the miserably endangered

00:38:53.210 --> 00:38:56.390
circumstances of ordinary
people in this broken down, war

00:38:56.390 --> 00:38:59.180
torn environment.

00:38:59.180 --> 00:39:03.760
It also looks to those, or seems
to find without even looking,

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:07.640
to dramatize or reveal
those sources of support

00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:12.600
and sustenance that get
us through bad times.

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.350
As you're watching the
ending of the film,

00:39:14.350 --> 00:39:15.850
ask yourself what
these things mean.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.390
I won't actually
tell you whether he

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:25.420
recovers the bike or not, let
you see that for yourself.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:27.960
But ask yourself, whether
or not he recovers the bike,

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.650
would it have made
any difference?

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.620
Does it matter given what
the film is finally saying

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.760
to us in those final images?

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:38.067
Well, character.

00:39:38.067 --> 00:39:40.025
This is one of the great
films about character,

00:39:40.025 --> 00:39:42.600
I think, especially
about the relation

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.850
between the father of the son.

00:39:43.850 --> 00:39:45.520
They're at the very
center of the film.

00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.830
I've already said in a way that
this Odyssey that they go on

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:50.130
is a travelogue.

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.060
It teaches us about
the geography,

00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:56.790
social circumstances, social
arrangements, and class system

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.570
and institutional
systems of Rome.

00:39:59.570 --> 00:40:00.610
It does that.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:04.090
But it's also an Odyssey in
which the father of the son

00:40:04.090 --> 00:40:07.060
get to know each other in
a deeper and in many ways,

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:09.150
much more disturbing
way than has ever

00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:10.630
happened to them before.

00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.090
The most poignant and terrible
thing about this film in fact,

00:40:14.090 --> 00:40:16.640
is that the Odyssey
I've been describing

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:19.780
through Rome with
his son, by Ricci,

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:24.370
is also an initiation story,
a story about growing up.

00:40:24.370 --> 00:40:26.580
But what happens to
Ricci's son in this film

00:40:26.580 --> 00:40:30.850
doesn't happen to most young
boys until they're much older.

00:40:30.850 --> 00:40:33.610
And it happens gradually,
not all at once.

00:40:33.610 --> 00:40:38.000
But what Ricci's son discovers
in the course of this day

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.030
are his father's flaws.

00:40:40.030 --> 00:40:42.730
He discovers things
about his father

00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:47.240
that no boy really wants
to know even if he's 67

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:50.830
years old like your professor.

00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:56.400
And he discovers these things
about his father in the most

00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:57.980
stressful circumstances.

00:40:57.980 --> 00:40:59.810
His father's violent
toward him, his father

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:01.047
is indifferent toward him.

00:41:01.047 --> 00:41:03.130
Then there are moments
when after his father feels

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:05.657
terrible anxiety and
grief over the way

00:41:05.657 --> 00:41:07.740
he's treated him where his
father tries to make up

00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.650
with him and you can see the boy
not wanting to let them do it.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:13.065
It's unbelievably rich.

00:41:13.065 --> 00:41:15.190
And I don't think anyone
who pays attention to this

00:41:15.190 --> 00:41:18.400
will fail to recognize the
interactions between the father

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:22.000
and son as unbelievably
true, marvelously

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.365
accurate to the way in
which loving parents

00:41:24.365 --> 00:41:26.490
and loving children often
interact with each other.

00:41:26.490 --> 00:41:28.781
Because they have many moments
where they're really not

00:41:28.781 --> 00:41:30.530
happy with each other at all.

00:41:30.530 --> 00:41:32.370
What the boy discovers
about his father

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:34.200
are some things
that no child ever

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:36.410
wants to know about his father.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:39.240
Not just that he's flawed, but
he's deeply, deeply flawed,

00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:43.110
that he's capable of
really terrible behavior.

00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:46.570
And the boy is-- something
happens in this Odyssey.

00:41:46.570 --> 00:41:48.600
It's one of the subtlest
things about the film.

00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:53.200
The basic relations between
fathers and sons are reversed.

00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.770
We find that the son,
this little child,

00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.760
is twice in the film in
the position of having

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:02.740
to rescue his father.

00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.690
I'm simplify certain
things because I don't

00:42:04.690 --> 00:42:05.860
want to give away the plot.

00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:08.190
But you'll see how this
works out in the film.

00:42:08.190 --> 00:42:10.920
I mean there are two moments
in the film in which Ricci

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:14.830
fate would be far more dire
than it is because of his son's

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.940
presence.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.850
His son, in a sense,
is his Savior.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:20.810
The fathers are supposed
to protect their sons

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.350
not the reverse.

00:42:22.350 --> 00:42:24.060
Part of the meaning
of this adventure

00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.610
is that Ricci has been reduced
to such a miserable level that

00:42:27.610 --> 00:42:32.380
even has to rely on his son's
help in order to get by.

00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:36.530
Both of them, the father and
son experience this reversal.

00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:40.230
So it's a psychologically
traumatic and deeply moving

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:41.110
experience.

00:42:41.110 --> 00:42:42.380
Although don't misunderstand.

00:42:42.380 --> 00:42:44.420
I'm not suggesting
that the child doesn't

00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:48.340
come to terms-- he does come
to terms with what he learns.

00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.620
I think is quite remarkable.

00:42:49.620 --> 00:42:51.650
I mean I would have
had trouble with what

00:42:51.650 --> 00:42:53.900
that boy comes to
terms with as an adult

00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:55.120
but he does it as a child.

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.010
But I think of course it's
also believable as you'll see.

00:42:59.010 --> 00:43:03.060
So the film is
profound and serious

00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.380
about the social circumstances
of postwar Italy.

00:43:06.380 --> 00:43:09.200
Is profound and serious
about the indifference

00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.270
of certain kinds of
institutional arrangements

00:43:11.270 --> 00:43:15.470
to the real miseries
of human experience.

00:43:15.470 --> 00:43:18.820
And it is a powerful and deep
exploration of human character

00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:21.830
and especially,
centrally, the relation

00:43:21.830 --> 00:43:23.350
between Ricci and his son.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:25.440
The relation between
fathers and sons--

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:29.050
becomes a kind of one of the
great parables of the relations

00:43:29.050 --> 00:43:31.290
between adults and children.

00:43:31.290 --> 00:43:36.040
It's one of the great father
and son stories of all time.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.470
Let me conclude by
saying a couple of words

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:39.979
about the title.

00:43:39.979 --> 00:43:42.520
I mean there's much more in the
film I wish I can talk about.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:44.490
But by this time in
the course if you

00:43:44.490 --> 00:43:46.960
can't get this stuff yourself,
I haven't done my job.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.440
I hope all of you are watching
films much more attentively

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:52.212
and carefully than
you had before.

00:43:52.212 --> 00:43:53.670
I hope that your
enjoyment has been

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:55.470
increased rather than
decreased by what

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:58.500
you've learned in this course.

00:43:58.500 --> 00:43:59.970
Let the Bicycle Thief be a test.

00:43:59.970 --> 00:44:02.520
Because in many ways it's
not kind of film most of you

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:04.210
guys would go out to watch.

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:06.880
First of all it's
in black and white.

00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:10.845
Second it's more
than 50 years old.

00:44:10.845 --> 00:44:12.220
But I think you'll
I think you'll

00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:17.116
recognize that it hasn't
aged, that the film is

00:44:17.116 --> 00:44:19.490
as compelling now as it was
when it was-- maybe even more

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.989
compelling now than
when it was made

00:44:20.989 --> 00:44:23.680
because some of the political
turmoil has disappeared.

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:28.570
There's no longer the
taint of fascism hanging

00:44:28.570 --> 00:44:32.550
over Italian
artistic productions

00:44:32.550 --> 00:44:34.050
as they were at
the end of the war.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:37.210
There's a historical
sense of the importance

00:44:37.210 --> 00:44:38.320
of this movement.

00:44:38.320 --> 00:44:42.380
So maybe we can look at these
neorealist films with a more

00:44:42.380 --> 00:44:45.650
objective eye than the
original audiences could.

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:48.540
In any case the title
is an interesting one.

00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:50.830
When it was first
translated into English,

00:44:50.830 --> 00:44:52.330
and in fact it's
still widely known,

00:44:52.330 --> 00:44:55.800
you might have noticed a
slips of the tongue on my part

00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.240
where I started to call
it the Bicycle Thief.

00:44:58.240 --> 00:45:01.342
And the reason is, it's
still often called that.

00:45:01.342 --> 00:45:03.550
When it was originally
brought into the United States

00:45:03.550 --> 00:45:05.620
and translated both
in Great Britain

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.130
and in the United States, it
was called The Bicycle Thief.

00:45:09.130 --> 00:45:10.760
Now the Italian
is in the plural.

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.820
It's Ladri di Bicilette.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:16.940
Thieves of the bicycle would
be the literal translation.

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:20.050
Right now the question
is why the plural?

00:45:20.050 --> 00:45:24.770
I think you could imagine the
answer just from that opening

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:26.520
sequence that I showed
you this afternoon.

00:45:31.230 --> 00:45:33.120
Why would it be plural?

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.392
Why would the title be plural?

00:45:34.392 --> 00:45:36.600
One of the reasons is from
the very opening sequence,

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.640
we see that everybody--
that the bicycle

00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:43.370
is a very ambiguous and
complicated symbol in the film.

00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:44.760
Symbol is a bad
word because it's

00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:47.340
such an actuality that
it seems pretentious

00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:48.500
to call it a symbol.

00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:50.300
You see hundreds
of maybe thousands

00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:51.920
of bicycles in the film.

00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:54.500
That's part of what makes
Ricci's loss of the bicycle so

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:55.400
poignant.

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:57.840
You have the sense as he's
walking around the city,

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.860
oh my God, everybody
has a bicycle.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:02.180
There are 10 million
bicycles in this city.

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:05.400
Poor Ricci can't
find one, can find--

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:10.110
there's something horrific about
the idea that an item so common

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:14.250
could still for Ricci you be
so precious, as to constitute

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:17.020
his livelihood or threaten
against his livelihood

00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:19.190
if he can't find the bicycle.

00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:21.400
You can guess now based
on what I've already

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.090
said one reason for why
the title is plural.

00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:24.667
Why?

00:46:24.667 --> 00:46:26.750
As Ricci's walking around
looking for his bicycle,

00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:28.490
walking through a
city full of hundreds

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:31.960
and thousands of bicycles,
what might he think?

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.080
What might you think if you
needed the bicycle desperately?

00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:38.700
Why not pinch one?

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.730
Why not thieve?

00:46:39.730 --> 00:46:41.745
So one of the reasons
that the title is plural

00:46:41.745 --> 00:46:43.245
is that Ricci is
one of the thieves.

00:46:46.536 --> 00:46:48.410
I'm only suggesting that
he's a thief by sort

00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:49.710
of psychological inclination.

00:46:49.710 --> 00:46:51.590
He looks lovingly--
as you'll see,

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:53.340
the plot makes this
even more explicit.

00:46:53.340 --> 00:46:55.500
I don't want to
give away the plot.

00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:56.060
I will.

00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:58.940
He actually does in a
certain sense become a thief.

00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:01.140
But long before he
becomes a literal thief

00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:04.010
and actually puts his hands
on someone else's bicycle,

00:47:04.010 --> 00:47:06.980
you and I might even think
some people in the audience

00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.270
may get the idea
before Ricci does.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:13.000
When you're watching this
guy, so terrible, looking

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.650
every place for his bicycle,
he's surrounded by bicycles,

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:18.860
sees inundated by bicycles.

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:22.800
After he recovers the bicycle,
before he goes to work,

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:26.520
on his wife asks him to take
into a special location.

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.020
She wants to thank someone.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:31.490
It turns out, that he had--
and they get on the bike,

00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:33.800
she rides behind him and
he rides over on the bike.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.590
And he waits outside this
place while his wife goes up.

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:38.350
His wife is taking a long time.

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:41.200
So he leans his bike
against the wall.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:42.450
He starts to go up the stairs.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.910
He looks, and sees his bike is
vulnerable so he walks down,

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:48.230
he finds a kid, gives the kid,
I think he gives the kid a coin,

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.292
and tells the kid
to guard the bike.

00:47:50.292 --> 00:47:52.250
And then he starts walking
up the stairs again.

00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:53.541
This is very early in the film.

00:47:53.541 --> 00:47:55.220
And think how clever this is.

00:47:55.220 --> 00:47:58.620
You're aware of how vulnerable
the bike is from that moment.

00:47:58.620 --> 00:48:01.600
This is a day before
it's stolen, right?

00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:04.390
You're aware of how precious
is and as he ascends

00:48:04.390 --> 00:48:06.390
the stairs you
actually become afraid

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:09.970
that his bicycle
might be stolen.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:12.460
So one of the reasons
the title is ambiguous

00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:15.250
is I think in the end, the
title encompasses not just

00:48:15.250 --> 00:48:17.030
the thief who
steals Ricci's bike

00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:20.130
and not just Ricci himself
who contemplates becoming

00:48:20.130 --> 00:48:24.120
a thief in his desperation, but
also the audience which becomes

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:27.900
complicit Ricci's impulse
to criminality because we

00:48:27.900 --> 00:48:30.070
are ourselves think God,
steal a goddamn bike.

00:48:30.070 --> 00:48:31.900
Take the bike.

00:48:31.900 --> 00:48:32.970
Stop worrying about it.

00:48:32.970 --> 00:48:33.520
Get it.

00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:34.030
Get away.

00:48:34.030 --> 00:48:35.280
There's a bike you could take.

00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:37.020
And I think anyone
watching the film

00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:39.420
has this feeling after
a relatively short time

00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.770
so that we are bicycle
thieves as well.

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:44.450
So part of the subtlety
of the title-- and you'll

00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:48.150
see as the film works itself
out, I've already implied this.

00:48:48.150 --> 00:48:50.510
When they finally catch up
the thief, alleged thief,

00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:52.040
the guy they think
is the thief, he

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.790
turns out to be an even
more miserable specimen

00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:55.600
than poor Ricci.

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:56.790
He's an epileptic.

00:48:56.790 --> 00:48:58.210
He's out of work.

00:48:58.210 --> 00:49:00.050
He has to be protected
by this community.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:01.960
His mother's very
protective of him.

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:05.310
There's some modest minor
possibility that he's acting,

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:11.410
that he's faking
his mental problems

00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:13.100
and maybe faking everything.

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:15.690
But I don't think so.

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:18.950
You could judge yourself
whether what is in any case,

00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:23.190
any case surely true, is that
the neighborhood coalesces

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.026
around him because
Ricci and his son

00:49:25.026 --> 00:49:26.940
are strangers and
are attacking someone

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:27.940
from their neighborhood.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:35.760
So when this happens, one
of the things you'll feel

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:40.120
is not just that
the thief Ricci was

00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:42.800
going after deserves
some sympathy too.

00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:48.250
You begin to feel some sense
that his difficulties are-- not

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:51.700
that you excuse his thievery--
but you understand it

00:49:51.700 --> 00:49:54.177
in a deep and
generous way I think.

00:49:54.177 --> 00:49:56.260
That complicates your sense
of who the thieves are

00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:57.343
and what thieves are like.

00:49:57.343 --> 00:49:59.270
And then you've come
to recognize that Ricci

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:00.770
is a potential thief.

00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:02.070
And you care about Ricci.

00:50:02.070 --> 00:50:05.435
You see what a loving father
he is, how desperate he

00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:07.600
is to take care of his family.

00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.280
So you sympathize with him.

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:12.000
And then, you realize
if you've been thinking

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.500
about it, that of
course you've been

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.980
covering bicycles yourself.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.550
So the audience
and the real thief

00:50:18.550 --> 00:50:21.460
and Ricci the would-be thief
are all implicated together

00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:24.550
as if what he's saying is
that our common humanity is

00:50:24.550 --> 00:50:26.720
what bicycle thieves suggest.

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.680
And that's one of the
reasons that the title

00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:31.380
needs to be plural
because the film is not

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.460
about a single bicycle thief.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:37.350
It's about the bicycle
thief in all of us.

00:50:37.350 --> 00:50:39.520
Enjoy the film.

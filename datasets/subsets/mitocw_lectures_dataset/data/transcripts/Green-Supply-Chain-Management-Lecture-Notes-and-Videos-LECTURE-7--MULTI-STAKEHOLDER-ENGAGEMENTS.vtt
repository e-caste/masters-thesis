00:00:30.707 --> 00:00:31.790
ALEXIS BATEMAN: All right.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.000
So today we're going to do
multi-stakeholder engagement.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.280
This is a little bit
different than what

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.910
we've been talking
about, as opposed

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.400
to assessing the impacts
of the supply chain

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.450
and looking at where
environmental savings can

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.950
be made.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.920
It's who can collaborate
to make those changes.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.729
When a company is trying to
integrate different programs

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:53.270
within their supply
chain, often they

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.811
can't do it their
own because they're

00:00:54.811 --> 00:00:57.487
working with supply
chain tiers deep--

00:00:57.487 --> 00:00:59.320
further than tier one,
tier two, tier three.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.653
So they need some different
eyes and different expertise

00:01:01.653 --> 00:01:05.170
that can support their
additional effort.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.580
Palm oil is a really
excellent case of this

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.470
because it's really deep in
a lot of different companies'

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.120
supply chains.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.110
It's usually a very small
component of a product

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.780
that they might sell, like in
the case of Nestle's Kit Kat.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.470
So who, before reading this case
knew about the palm oil issue?

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.446
What do you know about
it, that it was--

00:01:24.446 --> 00:01:25.874
AUDIENCE: Not the best choice.

00:01:25.874 --> 00:01:27.540
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Not
the best choice, OK.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.740
Did you know about the
environmental impact of it,

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.207
or more just that it
was a bad ingredient?

00:01:33.207 --> 00:01:34.290
AUDIENCE: Bad ingredient--

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.176
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Ingredient, OK.

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:35.970
AUDIENCE: Nothing specific.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.180
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Anybody
else have-- yeah,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.607
what did you know about it?

00:01:38.607 --> 00:01:40.982
AUDIENCE: I knew somewhat
about the environmental impact,

00:01:40.982 --> 00:01:43.090
but yeah, not--

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.376
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Just knowledge
that it was not very good.

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:48.250
AUDIENCE: Doing research
for the CDP project,

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.871
they talked about the RSPO.

00:01:49.871 --> 00:01:52.920
That's one of the things
they-- my company highlighted

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.543
in their CSR, it's like,
we are 100% certified palm

00:01:56.543 --> 00:01:59.791
oil or whatever, and I was like,
what is certified palm oil?

00:01:59.791 --> 00:02:01.540
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Did
that cause you to look

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.700
into it a little bit more?

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.515
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Yeah.

00:02:04.515 --> 00:02:07.890
So palm oil is a perfect
example of a material that

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.889
has a lot of
different stakeholders

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.130
that are being affected by
the growing of palm oil,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.250
by who's sourcing it, and the
supply chain that's in between.

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.276
They have the growers,
they have the mill

00:02:19.276 --> 00:02:20.900
that they process it
in, then they also

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.900
have a lot of middleman.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.180
So that is where the
supply chain, because it's

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.360
a commodity, a lot of
times the supply chains

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.410
are very non-clear,
not transparent.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.830
So they're not
able to see what's

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.040
happening deep in their supply
chains, the actual practices.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.360
Did everyone watching
the Nestle video?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.420
Because I feel like that was the
linchpin of this whole story,

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.417
where-- did everyone see it?

00:02:42.417 --> 00:02:43.250
You guys all saw it?

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.880
Yeah, so that's
kind of where it all

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.220
began, where
Greenpeace decided--

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.290
they had been actually
looking at the palm oil

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.710
issue for quite a
while before they

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:54.000
actually when after Nestle.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.810
And that was a
big turning point,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.602
when they decided that they
needed to go after the brand.

00:02:58.602 --> 00:03:00.810
And that's commonly what
we've found in our research,

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.110
is that going after the brand
is the more effective strategy

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.300
than actually going into
the deep tier supplier.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.876
Because it gets
the publicity, it

00:03:06.876 --> 00:03:08.750
gets consumers pushing
the hand of the brand,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.461
and then the brand actually
looks into their supply chain.

00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:12.960
So what I thought
we would do today,

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.260
I was originally going to break
you up into bigger groups,

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.600
but since we have-- well,
that's pretty good attendance,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.590
but what I think I'll do is
match you up in groups of three

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.170
and you can talk about
the plan that you created.

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.360
Everyone had the assignment of
acting as a consultant for GAR,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.370
for Golden Aggregate Resources.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.820
And I want to see what the
differences were in your plans

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.264
and come to an understanding
of what you guys thought.

00:03:40.264 --> 00:03:41.930
And then we can go
through the questions

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.390
together and see how
you guys went about it.

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:47.480
So why don't we--
you guys, three,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.390
why don't we do
threes right here,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.760
and then three right here,
you guys both triangular,

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.886
three right here, and then
you two, and then back there,

00:03:56.886 --> 00:03:58.010
and then three in the back.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.040
So we'll spend about 15 minutes,
and you guys just get your plan

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.910
and talk about the
differences you saw.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.680
And then I'll be spot calling
on answering questions

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.425
and your group will have to
answer on how you look at it.

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.358
So were you guys' strategies
very similar or different?

00:04:17.358 --> 00:04:18.649
AUDIENCE: Completely different.

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:19.390
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Completely different.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.632
In what way?

00:04:20.632 --> 00:04:23.913
AUDIENCE: I said we go with the
complete Greenpeace approach

00:04:23.913 --> 00:04:26.210
and point fingers
at anyone who's not,

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.364
and run our marketing
campaign that way.

00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:31.530
And then Matt took the
completely different approach

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.821
that we should put Greenpeace
as an irrelevant outsider

00:04:33.821 --> 00:04:37.359
and not let the outsiders
run the industry, etc.

00:04:37.359 --> 00:04:39.150
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So what
was-- why would you

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.060
look at it that way?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:47.060
AUDIENCE: Just so that if,
particularly from the marketing

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.380
standpoint I wrote
about, from regulation,

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.780
so regulation is going
to be an unknown.

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.380
And you want to establish,
since the RSPO is the industry

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.810
and that represents the
self regulating body,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.300
if you can establish
yourself as self regulating,

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.250
then you increase the
chances that you will not

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.210
require external help.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.970
So hopefully the
Indonesian government

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.360
would play a hands
off role if they

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.150
thought you were
taking care of things,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.640
and then you can be the
master of your own destiny.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.290
And then from an
investor's side,

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.160
so that it doesn't look like
you're getting pushed around

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.720
and responding in a
reactionary way to everything

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.210
that any external organization
says so that there's

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:29.955
some confidence
for the investors

00:05:29.955 --> 00:05:31.830
that you're not going
to change your business

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.460
strategy the next time someone
else comes around and says,

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.690
we think you should do this.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.010
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Sure.

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.890
So we have the
pro-Greenpeace, and then we

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.260
had the non-Greenpeace.

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.408
Any hybrid perspectives?

00:05:43.408 --> 00:05:45.658
All right, we'll get another
team that haven't spoken.

00:05:45.658 --> 00:05:47.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think I might
have missed a couple of things

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:50.510
in that case study, but I really
took a market driven approach

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.580
to take some of these standards,
organizations they belong to

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.610
and set those as the low bar
and offer an even higher premium

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:01.560
product that meets the
Greenpeace requirements

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.880
and allow the market to
decide the best [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.466
And use that additional
revenue to drive change down

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:08.297
to the farmer and
government level.

00:06:08.297 --> 00:06:10.880
ALEXIS BATEMAN: OK, so we've got
three different perspectives.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.520
So why don't we diagram out
who everyone's involved,

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.520
and we can see what
everyone else was

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.660
thinking on who was involved.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.657
Who are all the
stakeholders in this issue?

00:06:25.657 --> 00:06:26.240
AUDIENCE: GAR.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.890
ALEXIS BATEMAN: GAR, so we've
got, they're at the center,

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:31.788
the supplier of palm oil.

00:06:31.788 --> 00:06:32.954
AUDIENCE: Rural communities?

00:06:32.954 --> 00:06:35.290
AUDIENCE: Customers,
the direct customers.

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.930
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Sure, there are--

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.110
so there's several customers.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.870
AUDIENCE: I mean the
major corporations.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:43.932
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Major
corporations, the Nestles

00:06:43.932 --> 00:06:44.890
and Unilevers and such.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:46.354
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
guess that would

00:06:46.354 --> 00:06:48.800
be the [INAUDIBLE] brands.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.090
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So
they're out here.

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.610
They're a little bit separated.

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:54.356
Who else?

00:06:54.356 --> 00:06:55.272
AUDIENCE: The farmers.

00:06:55.272 --> 00:06:56.855
ALEXIS BATEMAN: We've
got the farmers.

00:06:56.855 --> 00:07:02.085
So they're in between
GAR and the corporation.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.660
AUDIENCE: Indonesian government.

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.750
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Indonesian government.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:10.750
Where would we put them?

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.520
They're kind of
out in left field.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.355
Oh, we're going to test
my spelling skills.

00:07:23.155 --> 00:07:26.970
AUDIENCE: Don't we
see the processing

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.132
mills are an intermediary?

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:31.855
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Yeah, so there's
the mills and processing.

00:07:41.626 --> 00:07:43.108
AUDIENCE: The certifying bodies.

00:07:43.108 --> 00:07:44.774
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Certifying bodies, yeah.

00:07:54.987 --> 00:07:56.820
AUDIENCE: I would say
above the corporations

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:58.115
you have the consumers.

00:07:58.115 --> 00:07:59.156
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:08:09.299 --> 00:08:11.714
Anybody else?

00:08:11.714 --> 00:08:13.230
AUDIENCE: Environmental
ag agencies.

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:13.660
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Sure.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:14.862
Where should we put them?

00:08:14.862 --> 00:08:15.570
They're kind of--

00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:18.230
AUDIENCE: There's the
environmental engineer type

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:19.896
people, and then
there's just people

00:08:19.896 --> 00:08:21.230
who care about the environment.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:22.396
ALEXIS BATEMAN: That's true.

00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:28.730
AUDIENCE: And investors.

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:30.840
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Investors, absolutely.

00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.770
So they are kind of in between.

00:08:38.670 --> 00:08:41.385
And we have green customers.

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.384
So you have anyone else?

00:08:54.384 --> 00:08:55.550
AUDIENCE: Local communities.

00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:57.466
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Local
communities, absolutely.

00:08:57.466 --> 00:08:59.650
So they're down here
with the farmers.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:10.927
What about the people who
are impacted by the burning?

00:09:10.927 --> 00:09:12.260
So it is actually the community.

00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:13.840
Well, that would be also
local communities, but also

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.923
international communities.

00:09:14.923 --> 00:09:17.884
I actually lived in Singapore
when they had the burnings,

00:09:17.884 --> 00:09:19.050
and there was actually haze.

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:21.062
I was outside playing
soccer and coughed up

00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:22.520
a lung because you
could actually--

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.110
the haze was so thick.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:26.282
It's not a fake thing.

00:09:26.282 --> 00:09:27.740
We've got international
communities

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:31.455
as well that were impacted
by slash-and-burn practices.

00:09:39.095 --> 00:09:42.530
So you have all
these stakeholders

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:45.150
and GAR is trying to
figure out their strategy.

00:09:45.150 --> 00:09:47.670
So you think about who
Greenpeace went to.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:50.250
They went directly
to the corporation

00:09:50.250 --> 00:09:52.550
and attacked their strategy
and what they were doing,

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.466
their actual material
that they were sourcing.

00:09:54.466 --> 00:09:56.220
But then that got
translated back

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.942
to the actual company that
was dealing with the palm oil.

00:09:59.942 --> 00:10:01.650
And then they had to
go through all these

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.940
different-- so did everyone
think about these as they were

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.860
going through their strategy?

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.760
Yes?

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.460
Sort of?

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:09.960
Not really?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.590
No, you guys seem to
decide fairly quickly.

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:12.100
Anyone else?

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.370
Did anyone else not
account for one of these

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.780
and might think differently,
think about some

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:21.181
of these other
external stakeholders?

00:10:21.181 --> 00:10:21.680
No?

00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.140
All right.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:23.620
So everyone thought
about everyone.

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.080
Everyone's good.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:24.830
AUDIENCE: I forgot
about the mills.

00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.656
ALEXIS BATEMAN: The mills?

00:10:25.656 --> 00:10:26.156
Yeah.

00:10:26.156 --> 00:10:27.128
The mills and press.

00:10:27.128 --> 00:10:29.128
AUDIENCE: I was thinking
about the other growers

00:10:29.128 --> 00:10:31.856
and other competitors
who are joining the ISPO

00:10:31.856 --> 00:10:33.784
and who might also [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:33.784 --> 00:10:35.950
ALEXIS BATEMAN: The other--
I'm sorry, say it again.

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:36.780
AUDIENCE: Other growers
and competitors.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:37.780
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Oh, yes.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:39.637
The other companies
that are-- so there

00:10:39.637 --> 00:10:43.710
are also the other
palm oil companies.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.460
So they're also
kind of in between.

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.270
No, they'd probably
be over here.

00:10:51.270 --> 00:10:53.416
You get the picture.

00:10:53.416 --> 00:10:55.290
Anyone want to talk
about their strategy that

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.600
are different from these
three, that they thought--

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.140
the marketing strategy?

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:01.350
Let's start with
the first question

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:03.950
in terms of how you're going
to market your palm oil.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:07.870
Given the strategy they have
now, how would you go about it?

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.360
AUDIENCE: We thought--
we agreed that we'd

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.900
be more vocal about
publishing the fact

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.000
that we were trying
to take a leadership

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.010
role in sustainability.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.060
So one of those
things might include

00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:21.980
having an annual
sustainability report

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.405
or something along those lines.

00:11:23.405 --> 00:11:25.780
And then we talked
about continuing

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:31.230
to work with Greenpeace to
maybe even set increasingly,

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.357
slightly, higher standards
or goals for ourselves.

00:11:34.357 --> 00:11:36.542
And then again, just
talking about those goals

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:39.390
and putting those out
there so that it gave us

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:41.590
additional credibility
in the market

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.707
as a leader in that front.

00:11:45.707 --> 00:11:47.790
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So I don't
know if you guys caught

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.970
the difference between
Greenpeace and the Forest

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:50.610
Trust.

00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.310
Did you guys catch
any subtle difference

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:54.262
of how each of those NGOs work?

00:11:54.262 --> 00:11:56.220
AUDIENCE: The Forest
Trust kind of-- Greenpeace

00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:58.110
was more on the
attack, it looked like.

00:11:58.110 --> 00:12:01.241
And then the Forest Trust
was more of an interview.

00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:03.740
You're like, OK, we'll work
with you to try to get what they

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:06.570
want, but-- they were
kind of the trusting--

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.020
AUDIENCE: They were like
the technical experts.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:11.804
So they'd measure trees
and thinks like that.

00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:14.437
They'd know the carbon
content of the peat soil.

00:12:14.437 --> 00:12:16.770
Whereas Greenpeace was just
like, you're not doing right

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:17.895
and we're going to get you.

00:12:17.895 --> 00:12:20.019
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So they're
kind of the voice behind

00:12:20.019 --> 00:12:21.479
to get the medial attention.

00:12:21.479 --> 00:12:23.020
So maybe the Forest
Trust would maybe

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.470
be the more strategic
collaborator

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.312
if they were going
to have an NGO that

00:12:27.312 --> 00:12:29.430
was pushing their standards.

00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.390
Anyone else have
different-- so you thought

00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:33.550
about a sustainability
report and then

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.550
working with an environmental
NGO to push goals.

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:39.580
To push, to keep them,
to push their goals.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:47.540
AUDIENCE: As well as trying to
become a leader with the RSPO,

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.630
maybe backing away from
the NGOs and trying

00:12:50.630 --> 00:12:52.200
to embark on the
global standard,

00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.630
to bring it up to
the level you're at

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:57.130
and then use your influence
with the government

00:12:57.130 --> 00:13:03.492
and with the organizations,
you can set the standard

00:13:03.492 --> 00:13:04.630
to your advantage.

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:05.180
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So
why did you think

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:07.980
that the RSPO might be the
way to go instead of doing it

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.864
more individually?

00:13:08.864 --> 00:13:10.530
AUDIENCE: I thought
because people would

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:11.613
be able to recognize that.

00:13:11.613 --> 00:13:15.790
People like standards, bodies,
they like things set better

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:17.440
than just an
agreement worked out,

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.170
where one party can
back out any time.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.220
The RSPO, if it gets
big enough, it's

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:25.451
kind of hard for people to back
out and everything, and for it

00:13:25.451 --> 00:13:25.950
to change.

00:13:25.950 --> 00:13:32.922
So I think that the ordinary
consumer would see RSPO,

00:13:32.922 --> 00:13:34.380
they've seen that
enough, they know

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:35.754
that when they're
just like, ours

00:13:35.754 --> 00:13:38.280
is Greenpeace approved, well,
what does that exactly mean?

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.280
That might be different
for every company.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.946
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So,
some standardization

00:13:41.946 --> 00:13:44.490
in the industry.

00:13:44.490 --> 00:13:48.090
Did anyone think about the
Indonesian standard as the way

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:51.990
to go, in terms of who
they thought the local way?

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:52.490
No?

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:54.840
No one thought about that.

00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:58.609
And why didn't you guys think
that that was the way to go?

00:13:58.609 --> 00:13:59.650
AUDIENCE: Not a standard.

00:13:59.650 --> 00:14:00.941
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Not a standard.

00:14:00.941 --> 00:14:03.550
But the two differences--
did you guys look at the fact

00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:05.640
that one was voluntary and
then one was mandatory?

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.080
Did that play into your
decision factor at all?

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:11.824
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we all
talked about-- i mean,

00:14:11.824 --> 00:14:17.170
not like the marketing
fluff strategies,

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:19.010
but the bigger issue
bringing the product

00:14:19.010 --> 00:14:23.900
to market being that only
10% of palm oil is certified,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:28.660
and of that, a very small margin
is actually sold at a premium.

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:33.346
So the real issue is getting
out of the niche market

00:14:33.346 --> 00:14:36.690
and making it more of
a tradeable commodity.

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:43.185
And to do that, GAR
already complies

00:14:43.185 --> 00:14:45.199
by default with
the ISPO standards,

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:49.160
just because there are
global laws and regulations.

00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.740
And then, obviously, the
RSPO is more voluntary.

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.800
So I think if they work with the
government more as law and not

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:04.960
as much marketing, it would
help the whole industry bring

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.120
more certified product to market
and raise their profitability.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.810
And then the RSPO
could be like-- I

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:17.395
used the example of the LEED
building rating system, where

00:15:17.395 --> 00:15:19.270
it's this voluntary
thing that you can add on

00:15:19.270 --> 00:15:21.330
to increase the marketability.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:24.735
So it would be like
a two tiered system.

00:15:24.735 --> 00:15:27.751
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So the
standard and the marketing.

00:15:27.751 --> 00:15:28.250
Got it.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:31.040
So you touch on the
fact that there's

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.890
a price premium
that may or may not

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:34.460
be making it to the farmers.

00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.840
Do you guys see other issues
with making the sustainable

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:41.080
supply chain of palm oil,
what the challenges were

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.940
in translating what they RSPO
is doing into a sustainable palm

00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.430
oil supply chain?

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:51.326
AUDIENCE: For example, as we
were discussing in the group,

00:15:51.326 --> 00:15:56.757
[INAUDIBLE] and then
the RSPO accepts oil

00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:58.631
from certified and
non-certified plantations.

00:15:58.631 --> 00:16:05.370
So there are lots of blurry
points in the supply chain

00:16:05.370 --> 00:16:07.820
that will make it
difficult to assess

00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.740
if it's really sustainable,
and to what extent.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.894
ALEXIS BATEMAN: All right,
so a major challenge

00:16:13.894 --> 00:16:15.810
would be the transparency,
so you can't really

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:18.700
see where what sources
are coming in where.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:20.830
So even if Unilever
decides that they

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.431
want to source 100%
RSPO certified palm oil,

00:16:23.431 --> 00:16:24.930
doesn't necessarily
mean that that's

00:16:24.930 --> 00:16:25.680
all they're going to get.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:28.304
They're going to pay for it, but
that might not be the palm oil

00:16:28.304 --> 00:16:29.730
that they actually receive.

00:16:29.730 --> 00:16:31.800
Any the other
challenges you guys

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.680
see in this in terms of maybe
the RSPO as an intermediary

00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:41.590
in the funding having to be
paid for-- farmers having

00:16:41.590 --> 00:16:42.620
to pay for it?

00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.475
Did you guys think
about that aspect?

00:16:45.475 --> 00:16:48.522
AUDIENCE: Well, one of the
things that the ISPO addressed

00:16:48.522 --> 00:16:51.020
was that the small and medium
sized farmers couldn't afford

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.542
the certification process.

00:16:52.542 --> 00:16:55.916
So you have to address
that if you wanted

00:16:55.916 --> 00:16:58.326
to take on certification.

00:17:02.664 --> 00:17:04.339
AUDIENCE: It also
seemed like there

00:17:04.339 --> 00:17:05.900
was a great amount
of uncertainty

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:08.290
as to the actual cost.

00:17:08.290 --> 00:17:14.829
Some studies cited
Indian investors

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:18.382
buying stock in certified
companies because the fact

00:17:18.382 --> 00:17:24.470
that they were certified reduced
projected risk and processing

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:25.737
disturbances.

00:17:25.737 --> 00:17:29.530
They calculated that
the cost of certifying

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:33.760
would be mitigated
by or accounted

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:38.944
for by one day of a mill being
shut down due to global unrest.

00:17:38.944 --> 00:17:41.750
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So major
impacts to the smaller--

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:46.116
AUDIENCE: So there needs to be
some more industry collected

00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:49.470
data if we can agree on it.

00:17:49.470 --> 00:17:51.700
ALEXIS BATEMAN: More
information to make a decision.

00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.580
AUDIENCE: This is
sort of [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:06.919
but if we take a look at the
sustainability on the supply

00:18:06.919 --> 00:18:09.270
chain at the larger scale,
they were saying in the case

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:12.930
that investors and
financial people

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:18.534
were investing only in
plantations and in firms that

00:18:18.534 --> 00:18:20.187
had a sustainable supply chain.

00:18:20.187 --> 00:18:22.520
So I'm assuming that if they
don't have the transparency

00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.330
to assess this, they
might just not fund

00:18:26.330 --> 00:18:29.380
companies to produce palm oil.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.920
At some point, there
might be issues

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.905
also in the supply chain
for its long term cost.

00:18:35.905 --> 00:18:36.780
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Sure.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.890
So it's more of a
short term perspective.

00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.510
So what else haven't
we covered in here?

00:18:56.950 --> 00:19:00.260
So we were talking about the
burden on the small farmer

00:19:00.260 --> 00:19:02.459
and their inability
to be certified,

00:19:02.459 --> 00:19:04.250
and maybe the changes
in the uprun of costs

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.155
of certifying and changing
to sustainable practices.

00:19:07.155 --> 00:19:09.280
What do you guys think,
what do the different teams

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.990
think about what GAR should
do about that, in terms

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.130
of treating the small
farmers as opposed

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:15.450
to their larger farmers?

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.782
No one thought about
the small guys?

00:19:21.782 --> 00:19:23.240
AUDIENCE: I thought about them.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:26.435
It's more you actually
struggle to figure out

00:19:26.435 --> 00:19:30.950
how it can be incentivized
not to use all their land.

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:33.825
So thinking of somehow
a way to place a premium

00:19:33.825 --> 00:19:39.381
on the product that is
harvested with less land

00:19:39.381 --> 00:19:46.952
and putting in a cap on
how much virgin forest

00:19:46.952 --> 00:19:49.410
they need to have in order to
be able to sell into the more

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:50.999
premium market.

00:19:50.999 --> 00:19:51.832
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Cap.

00:19:55.830 --> 00:19:57.871
AUDIENCE: So one of the
things that we identified

00:19:57.871 --> 00:20:04.160
during our discussion was
that the Indonesian farmers

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.365
or production was
not very efficient,

00:20:06.365 --> 00:20:09.190
or they didn't have a
very high productivity.

00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:13.928
So one way we identified to
increase production and please

00:20:13.928 --> 00:20:16.373
local government and
local authorities,

00:20:16.373 --> 00:20:19.510
but also the Indonesian
government in general

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:22.028
was to actually help the
small farmers increase

00:20:22.028 --> 00:20:23.020
their productivity.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.508
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Oh, sure.

00:20:24.508 --> 00:20:29.230
Be sort of an Intermediary
to get them to that place

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:30.270
so they could afford it.

00:20:36.162 --> 00:20:38.617
AUDIENCE: I also found a
case that mentioned something

00:20:38.617 --> 00:20:42.000
about bans and
third party audits.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.590
So that's a very-- imposing
that relations on the farmer,

00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:51.295
I think it should motivate
them to be more sustainable.

00:20:51.295 --> 00:20:56.310
Instead of using that many
fees and scaring them away,

00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:58.320
incentivize them
to use sustainable

00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.856
practices and pay them or use
financial incentives to be--

00:21:03.856 --> 00:21:05.356
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So
carrot and stick.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.220
Did you guys think the
RSPO is more like a stick

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:16.700
because it's a costs burden?

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:20.590
Or how did you see the
RSPO certification?

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.346
AUDIENCE: More as
the carrot, I think.

00:21:22.346 --> 00:21:24.019
Because it gives
them the incentive

00:21:24.019 --> 00:21:26.005
whereas the ISPO
would be the stick.

00:21:26.005 --> 00:21:27.130
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Sure, yeah.

00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:28.500
Everyone agree with that?

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:33.052
Yeah, I think sort of the--
kind of see the difference.

00:21:38.290 --> 00:21:42.370
So what about
communication strategy?

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.190
We talked about
marketing, but then you

00:21:44.190 --> 00:21:46.350
have all these stakeholders
that you're then

00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:49.110
going to start deciding
what you're going to do.

00:21:49.110 --> 00:21:52.240
So there's a-- we
thought about a report.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.374
Sometimes I sit all
day in my office

00:21:54.374 --> 00:21:55.790
and I read
sustainability reports,

00:21:55.790 --> 00:21:57.748
and I think I'm the only
person who reads that.

00:21:57.748 --> 00:21:59.680
So what other
strategies do you think

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.010
that GAR can do to
get down to each

00:22:03.010 --> 00:22:06.120
of these stakeholders in terms
of translating what they're

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.814
doing?

00:22:07.814 --> 00:22:09.480
AUDIENCE: We talked
about Justin Bieber,

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.950
but then we were actually
talking about famous soccer

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:12.450
players.

00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:14.116
ALEXIS BATEMAN: I
wondered what you guys

00:22:14.116 --> 00:22:15.816
were talking about over here.

00:22:15.816 --> 00:22:18.670
Justin Bieber.

00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.470
AUDIENCE: We just
used somebody that

00:22:20.470 --> 00:22:24.820
is-- that all these guys can--
all these stakeholders can

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.700
relate to or see or know of.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:28.660
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Sure.

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:36.840
So maybe some sort of celebrity
advocating for sustainable

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.536
palm oil.

00:22:38.536 --> 00:22:40.360
AUDIENCE: Or
sustainability, yeah.

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.901
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Sustainability
in general or sustainable palm

00:22:42.901 --> 00:22:43.790
oil?

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:44.839
AUDIENCE: Palm oil.

00:22:44.839 --> 00:22:46.380
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Well, it's different.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:48.630
AUDIENCE: I think in general,
it's going to be easier.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:52.239
Otherwise, palm oil is such
a low-level ingredient that

00:22:52.239 --> 00:22:56.183
soccer players [INAUDIBLE] it.

00:22:56.183 --> 00:22:58.155
AUDIENCE: We were
mentioning in this group

00:22:58.155 --> 00:23:01.852
that the education of the
farmers and the trainees, that

00:23:01.852 --> 00:23:06.043
can also be a long term
return for the [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:06.043 --> 00:23:09.987
of the population is
education in sustainable ways

00:23:09.987 --> 00:23:13.684
to cultivate, and
also get in line

00:23:13.684 --> 00:23:17.382
with the ENGO and the
certifying bodies,

00:23:17.382 --> 00:23:19.880
medical communities, and
pretty much everybody.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:20.850
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Sure.

00:23:20.850 --> 00:23:23.600
So one challenge that's here is
there's usually an upfront cost

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:25.440
for the company.

00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.560
What would be your argument
for, if you guys can chime in,

00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.360
what would be the
argument for that,

00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.534
that this would be a valid--

00:23:31.534 --> 00:23:33.158
AUDIENCE: I think
also a better return.

00:23:33.158 --> 00:23:38.048
There is an upfront cost,
but if the farmers are

00:23:38.048 --> 00:23:42.952
able to have better production
and better education,

00:23:42.952 --> 00:23:46.896
then there might be also, first,
the better return in the end,

00:23:46.896 --> 00:23:48.868
and then a better
relationship with them.

00:23:48.868 --> 00:23:51.333
And they can also
be more cooperative.

00:23:51.333 --> 00:23:54.784
And it can also ground for
the long term [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:54.784 --> 00:23:59.277
in Indonesia and in
this part of the world.

00:23:59.277 --> 00:24:00.735
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
think that's key,

00:24:00.735 --> 00:24:03.070
because they were
talking about how

00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:06.000
negotiating with the
local communities

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.960
was becoming more
and more part of what

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.620
they had to do before they could
establish their bigger farms.

00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.770
If they had a reputation
of maybe providing

00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:17.040
educational services
or equipment

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:19.890
training to local
communities, they

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:24.544
could potentially acquire more
land and do more business.

00:24:24.544 --> 00:24:26.502
AUDIENCE: A lot of these
NGOs have deep pockets

00:24:26.502 --> 00:24:29.108
and far reaches, so if
you can partner with them,

00:24:29.108 --> 00:24:31.809
they would probably participate
in an education and training

00:24:31.809 --> 00:24:34.264
program where wouldn't have
to shoulder all of the cost.

00:24:34.264 --> 00:24:38.420
ALEXIS BATEMAN: NGO as a
source of collaboration.

00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:47.250
Anybody else?

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:50.510
how about when you're trying
to get to your investors?

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:51.940
What do you think?

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:52.650
An avenue that--

00:24:55.990 --> 00:25:00.090
AUDIENCE: Ford just puts
their sustainability strategy

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:04.910
into their business strategy,
so they have all the information

00:25:04.910 --> 00:25:07.310
on their corporate
website, which is probably

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:11.189
where current investors and
potential future investors

00:25:11.189 --> 00:25:14.980
are going to go to get
information about the company.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.880
And then I also said that Ford
has a specific sustainability

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.240
department.

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:25.296
So if you had the
resources and the manpower,

00:25:25.296 --> 00:25:26.670
that might be
something that they

00:25:26.670 --> 00:25:28.610
would want to look
at doing, just

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:31.430
to help communicate the
fact that this is something

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.479
that they think about.

00:25:34.479 --> 00:25:36.710
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So I'm
putting in the [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:39.484
That's the Q&A source.

00:25:39.484 --> 00:25:41.420
AUDIENCE: I think
it's also not totally

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:43.810
unprecedented for
governments to provide

00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.556
some kind of financial
incentives or tax breaks

00:25:46.556 --> 00:25:49.902
to companies that do good stuff.

00:25:49.902 --> 00:25:52.770
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Right.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:56.560
So GAR could probably get a lot
of different resources going

00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.390
to different stakeholders,
going iterative feedback.

00:25:59.390 --> 00:26:02.136
They can see how
they can help them.

00:26:02.136 --> 00:26:02.870
I like that.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.370
All right.

00:26:06.487 --> 00:26:07.070
Went to sleep.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.700
So then let's think
about the bigger picture.

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.020
So we've got all
these stakeholders

00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:19.915
to decide about a
marketing strategy, what

00:26:19.915 --> 00:26:23.602
are the angles of getting a
more sustainable supply chain,

00:26:23.602 --> 00:26:25.310
how we're going to
help the small farmers

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:27.287
versus large farmers,
and then how we're

00:26:27.287 --> 00:26:28.370
going to communicate that.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.860
So what are the overall impacts?

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.810
How is this going to
translate and impact

00:26:33.810 --> 00:26:36.190
in terms of whether
you're certifying,

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:37.660
working with the local farmers?

00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.660
If you guys have
some kind of broad

00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.060
take takeaways from the case?

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:45.481
AUDIENCE: Well, I thought
one of the major differences

00:26:45.481 --> 00:26:47.820
between what they're
doing now and what

00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.569
the current certification
bodies are doing

00:26:49.569 --> 00:26:51.337
is the deforestation issue.

00:26:51.337 --> 00:26:53.170
They have to make a
decision whether they're

00:26:53.170 --> 00:26:54.706
going to continue
that commitment

00:26:54.706 --> 00:26:58.108
and, I think, maybe add
a certification level

00:26:58.108 --> 00:27:01.996
on top of what's out there to
take credit for what they're

00:27:01.996 --> 00:27:04.580
doing for the
deforestation, or to lower

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.100
their standards to
become more competitive

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.475
with the other companies.

00:27:09.475 --> 00:27:10.900
And I think that
that's something

00:27:10.900 --> 00:27:12.918
they're going to have
to make a decision on

00:27:12.918 --> 00:27:16.060
as far as what they're going
to go with as a company.

00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:19.684
And I don't know,
based on the data,

00:27:19.684 --> 00:27:24.290
that there is a need for
something of that high level

00:27:24.290 --> 00:27:27.170
unless you say you're going to
a market with the United States

00:27:27.170 --> 00:27:28.790
or that's maybe more niche.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:32.193
Because it shows that the sales
right now aren't in markets

00:27:32.193 --> 00:27:36.050
that really care about
the sustainability.

00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.730
They're more
cost-driven markets.

00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:39.640
So I think overall,
they need to look

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.430
at where they want to
take their company,

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:43.320
if they wanted to the
niche sustainability

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.234
and maintain their
deforestation commitment

00:27:46.234 --> 00:27:47.900
or if they want to
lower their standards

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:49.937
and become competitive
in the bigger markets.

00:27:49.937 --> 00:27:51.770
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Yeah,
perfect way to put it.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:55.530
What did anyone else think
about going higher or lower?

00:27:55.530 --> 00:27:57.860
AUDIENCE: I'd say the same
in encouraging innovation

00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:01.860
in industry, trying to find
other ways to grow the business

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.160
without the deforestation.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.960
That was the
default for a while,

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.700
but maybe there are other
ways to use their land

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:10.950
and that sort of thing,
change the way they're growing

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:11.908
and that sort of thing.

00:28:11.908 --> 00:28:15.348
I thought it might open up the
industry to some innovation

00:28:15.348 --> 00:28:17.535
if they stay as
one of the leaders.

00:28:17.535 --> 00:28:18.410
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Sure.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:21.540
Push the industry in support
of defaulting to the standard.

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.030
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:24.030 --> 00:28:24.764
hasn't spoken?

00:28:24.764 --> 00:28:25.976
You have some thoughts?

00:28:25.976 --> 00:28:29.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah, one thought I
have is that for [INAUDIBLE],

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.842
the company seems
like it's passively

00:28:31.842 --> 00:28:34.800
responsible [INAUDIBLE] coming
from different directions.

00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:39.237
So I think they should take
some more proactive actions

00:28:39.237 --> 00:28:40.716
to take leadership.

00:28:40.716 --> 00:28:45.153
Inviting multiple different
stakeholders [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:45.153 --> 00:28:47.660
Especially for the
Greenpeace, I think

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:52.262
they should, instead
of just [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:52.262 --> 00:28:55.106
respond to the [INAUDIBLE],
they should try and work

00:28:55.106 --> 00:28:59.060
with Greenpeace,
set up common goals.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.525
Because the NGO [INAUDIBLE]
environmental issues,

00:29:02.525 --> 00:29:05.495
people tend to be more educated
in governmental targets.

00:29:05.495 --> 00:29:08.960
So if they are convinced that a
company is making great effort,

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.889
I'm sure I think they
are going to promote

00:29:10.889 --> 00:29:11.930
the brand of the company.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:18.870
So this will actually help to
boost [INAUDIBLE] corporations.

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:22.220
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Anyone else
have thoughts on implications

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.570
of working with Greenpeace
and getting them on board

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:27.857
with what they're doing?

00:29:27.857 --> 00:29:29.440
What's happening
there with Greenpeace

00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:34.530
as sort of the pushing
the buttons organization?

00:29:34.530 --> 00:29:36.590
Kind of the same, everyone
saw the same thing.

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.590
What about overall impacts,
other overall impacts

00:29:40.590 --> 00:29:41.470
of a new strategy?

00:29:46.446 --> 00:29:47.320
So, pretty confident?

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:49.840
So we're going to--
we're still stuck

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.500
between adopting a
higher-- anyone think

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.540
staying with a lower
standard is the way to go,

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:57.370
that going with the
way the trend is

00:29:57.370 --> 00:29:59.630
and committing to the
lowest common denominator?

00:29:59.630 --> 00:30:03.046
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] other
than the Greenpeace association.

00:30:03.046 --> 00:30:05.486
I was very surprised
because Greenpeace

00:30:05.486 --> 00:30:08.250
is defined as a pure
ENGO, as opposed

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:12.100
to ENGOs [INAUDIBLE],
for examples.

00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.470
So pure ENGOs are known to
be extremely pure in the line

00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.265
that they preach
and not to associate

00:30:19.265 --> 00:30:23.920
themselves anyhow with
corporations because they're

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:28.222
not pure enough and they
have to [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:28.222 --> 00:30:31.825
And [INAUDIBLE] firms
like all the primary ENGOs

00:30:31.825 --> 00:30:34.300
are working hand in
hand with corporations.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:36.280
So I was very surprised
that Greenpeace

00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:42.574
would associate itself with
GAR and work with them, even

00:30:42.574 --> 00:30:46.450
if the whole process is
not always sustainable.

00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:49.820
For me, in a way,
they are tied with GAR

00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.490
in a very consistent way with
what they do in a pure line.

00:30:54.490 --> 00:30:57.315
But then, I don't think
they're pushing the buttons.

00:30:57.315 --> 00:30:59.515
Because if we just take
a look at the bottom line

00:30:59.515 --> 00:31:05.660
of their chart of what they want
to do, they've cut off now also

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:07.090
ties to GAR.

00:31:07.090 --> 00:31:09.124
And they're also
associating themselves

00:31:09.124 --> 00:31:11.860
with something that
is not perfect,

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:16.101
which is a huge break compared
to what they usually preach.

00:31:16.101 --> 00:31:17.892
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So you
felt like Greenpeace

00:31:17.892 --> 00:31:20.130
should keep the hard
line and not associate--

00:31:20.130 --> 00:31:20.410
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:31:20.410 --> 00:31:21.220
That's not what I'm saying.

00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:21.810
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Oh, you don't know,

00:31:21.810 --> 00:31:22.965
it's just something you noticed.

00:31:22.965 --> 00:31:23.864
AUDIENCE: I was just
surprised that there

00:31:23.864 --> 00:31:25.986
was such a shift,
that they accepted

00:31:25.986 --> 00:31:28.370
such a shift in their model.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:29.604
Because usually they don't.

00:31:29.604 --> 00:31:30.770
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Right, yeah.

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.400
So a shift in
Greenpeace's strategy.

00:31:36.038 --> 00:31:39.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] the
perspective of other firms

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:43.099
[INAUDIBLE] environmentalism.

00:31:43.099 --> 00:31:46.508
And they're pushing the button
in what many people affirm it.

00:31:46.508 --> 00:31:47.969
I think, actually,
the consequences

00:31:47.969 --> 00:31:54.787
are [INAUDIBLE], given
the different models

00:31:54.787 --> 00:31:57.290
that they had first.

00:31:57.290 --> 00:31:59.730
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Do you guys
have any thoughts on maybe,

00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:01.170
because of this
and how everyone's

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.378
responding as the nature of
palm oil, or any thoughts

00:32:03.378 --> 00:32:07.820
on the issue of the commodity,
kind of a commodity product--

00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.850
material-- as opposed
to something that maybe

00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:11.452
had a more clear supply chain?

00:32:11.452 --> 00:32:13.660
AUDIENCE: Well, the problem
of the commodity material

00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:18.088
is that it's basically
almost not differentiable.

00:32:18.088 --> 00:32:21.532
And palm oil [INAUDIBLE]
commodity material.

00:32:21.532 --> 00:32:24.950
So what is the added value
of this high differentiation

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.700
and high efforts and a
sustainable supply chain

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.764
if it's a commodity in the end?

00:32:29.764 --> 00:32:35.740
So I think that customers of GAR
are really key in this process

00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:42.214
by pushing the system toward
more sustainable practices.

00:32:42.214 --> 00:32:46.740
But for me, they are the real
key of the whole process.

00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:48.990
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So you think
that the corporations are

00:32:48.990 --> 00:32:50.750
the key in what
they're sourcing,

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:54.650
like the Nestles, or the actual
buyer, like the consumers?

00:32:54.650 --> 00:32:57.106
AUDIENCE: I think it's
the ripple effect.

00:32:57.106 --> 00:32:59.238
In the case, it
was Nestle, but I

00:32:59.238 --> 00:33:03.420
think Nestle is acting like this
because they are engaged also

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:06.024
in sustainable practices because
the consumers are wanting it,

00:33:06.024 --> 00:33:08.955
and they don't want to have
this ripple effect on them

00:33:08.955 --> 00:33:10.700
like Unilever or
whatever, or they're

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.684
using suppliers are
destroying forests.

00:33:13.684 --> 00:33:15.850
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So who
thinks customers are actually

00:33:15.850 --> 00:33:17.990
demanding this?

00:33:17.990 --> 00:33:19.431
Sustainable palm oil?

00:33:19.431 --> 00:33:21.180
Did anyone know about
sustainable palm oil

00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:24.150
before they got here, when
they look at their products?

00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:24.950
No.

00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.350
So absolutely, great
point, customers

00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:29.650
are a key factor in
this, but in the end,

00:33:29.650 --> 00:33:32.080
when a customer picks
up their product,

00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:34.480
the likelihood of them
actually knowing that palm oil

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.623
is in the product, so
sometimes it's a challenge.

00:33:37.623 --> 00:33:41.600
AUDIENCE: I think a lot
of these companies also,

00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.900
so the corporate customers
probably look at as much

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:50.130
of a risk mitigation strategy
as they do with anything else.

00:33:50.130 --> 00:33:53.700
So my background before
this was in food and--

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.920
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Was in what?

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.550
AUDIENCE: I was in
food preparation.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.925
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Oh, that's great.

00:33:57.925 --> 00:34:00.520
AUDIENCE: And I was
in a lot of companies

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.800
where they might not believe
that their consumers currently

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.390
care about what-- about the
sustainability of a given

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:09.600
ingredient or product,
all it takes-- they also

00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:13.258
realize that all it takes
is like, you remember

00:34:13.258 --> 00:34:15.214
the pink sludge thing
that basically shut down

00:34:15.214 --> 00:34:17.179
an entire company in
a matter of a month.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.429
It just takes something like
that coming out, like one

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:21.870
video, and the next
thing you know,

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:23.309
then everybody
cares very deeply,

00:34:23.309 --> 00:34:24.989
and there's a big outcry, and
you might not have a business.

00:34:24.989 --> 00:34:27.070
So I think there's
some element too

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:32.026
where they should be thinking
about a long term risk

00:34:32.026 --> 00:34:33.484
mitigation strategy.

00:34:33.484 --> 00:34:35.914
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Sure, absolutely.

00:34:35.914 --> 00:34:39.540
Future risk planning
and maybe learning

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.919
from what happens to Nestle.

00:34:43.630 --> 00:34:47.247
Although Tony and I have been
working on a research book

00:34:47.247 --> 00:34:49.080
on environmentally
sustainable supply chains

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:51.530
with a couple of people, Dr.
Blanco and Professor Yossi

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:52.030
Sheffi.

00:34:52.030 --> 00:34:55.889
But we actually looked at
their shareholder price after,

00:34:55.889 --> 00:34:58.189
and it did absolutely
nothing to Nestle.

00:34:58.189 --> 00:34:59.730
It actually didn't
drop at all, so we

00:34:59.730 --> 00:35:00.896
were really sad to see that.

00:35:00.896 --> 00:35:03.292
But we looked.

00:35:03.292 --> 00:35:07.020
AUDIENCE: There's also the
looming biofuel discussion,

00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.030
which I don't know,
but I would imagine

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.815
there's even less transparency
in where you get that palm oil

00:35:12.815 --> 00:35:14.214
and how it's used.

00:35:14.214 --> 00:35:15.880
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Yeah,
I would encouraged

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.290
you guys to look into
ethanol, and you'll

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:20.740
see the same exact mess.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:21.690
Very similar.

00:35:21.690 --> 00:35:23.398
Anyone else who didn't
get to get to talk

00:35:23.398 --> 00:35:25.220
have any overarching
comments on what

00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.280
they thought about the case?

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.800
JB?

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.042
No, nothing at all?

00:35:31.042 --> 00:35:33.900
AUDIENCE: I think
overall, addressing

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:37.806
all this stakeholders is a
step in the right direction.

00:35:37.806 --> 00:35:40.901
Everything has a pro or con.

00:35:40.901 --> 00:35:42.276
The impact on what
they're trying

00:35:42.276 --> 00:35:46.341
to do to the environment--
it's in the right direction

00:35:46.341 --> 00:35:50.167
and everything is going
towards a more sustainable.

00:35:50.167 --> 00:35:52.000
There's still have a
lot of work to be done,

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.880
but getting involved with
farmers, stakeholders,

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:59.755
governments, even Greenpeace,
even though they kind of got

00:35:59.755 --> 00:36:00.980
manipulated into doing this.

00:36:00.980 --> 00:36:04.253
It actually ends up being
towards the greater good,

00:36:04.253 --> 00:36:07.360
not only for the communities,
but for the environment.

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.280
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So you're kind
of on the something's better

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:11.720
than nothing.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:14.630
Does everyone feel similar, or
feel like the high standard's

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.850
the way to go?

00:36:15.850 --> 00:36:18.331
I feel like we have
sort of a split in here.

00:36:18.331 --> 00:36:18.830
Anyone?

00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:23.233
All right, well--

00:36:23.233 --> 00:36:24.483
AUDIENCE: I do have something.

00:36:24.483 --> 00:36:26.430
Like I shared with
them, I just got back

00:36:26.430 --> 00:36:28.000
from Hershey, Pennsylvania.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:29.950
Went on the little
Hershey chocolate--

00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:30.990
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Did you bring back

00:36:30.990 --> 00:36:32.014
samples for the whole class?

00:36:32.014 --> 00:36:33.950
AUDIENCE: Actually, I
did, not for the class.

00:36:36.854 --> 00:36:40.555
I ate what I brought in.

00:36:40.555 --> 00:36:42.560
If you ever want to go,
it's a pretty cool tour.

00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.143
You do wind up with
a lot of chocolate

00:36:44.143 --> 00:36:45.610
when it's all said and done.

00:36:45.610 --> 00:36:47.776
But what I was going to
say, what I told them about,

00:36:47.776 --> 00:36:51.819
was one of the things they told
about Milton Hershey was back

00:36:51.819 --> 00:36:54.110
when he was starting the
company after he went bankrupt

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:57.070
several times, once
he went down to Cuba,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:36:59.060
he was trying to find
out about the sugar

00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:00.950
that he was using, where
it was coming from,

00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:04.010
how it was coming, basically
saw the deplorable conditions

00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:08.000
that the Cuban sugar cane
farmers were working in,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.564
and basically created his own
collective or his own co-op

00:37:11.564 --> 00:37:13.230
down there, if you
want to call it that.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:14.789
But did much along
the same lines.

00:37:14.789 --> 00:37:16.955
He went down there, he
wasn't prodded into doing it,

00:37:16.955 --> 00:37:17.860
he just did it.

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.600
He and his wife had gone down,
she had some medical issues,

00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.560
and they were still
looking for some place

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.564
to make her-- she had
what we would say today

00:37:25.564 --> 00:37:26.532
was multiple sclerosis.

00:37:26.532 --> 00:37:30.844
They went down and they
created a school, a hospital,

00:37:30.844 --> 00:37:31.760
put them all together.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:35.780
Again, much along the same lines
of everything on the board,

00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:37.270
by bringing them
all together, they

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:39.790
became more productive
sugar cane farmers.

00:37:39.790 --> 00:37:43.321
They had medical care,
they had education,

00:37:43.321 --> 00:37:45.820
they built schools and things
like that for them down there.

00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:48.530
And it was basically this board,
but it was somebody just doing

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:50.160
it on their own.

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.770
Of course, he was making
millions of dollars,

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.030
that probably didn't hurt.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:58.340
But along the same lines, just
without the NGOs thrown in,

00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.770
just somebody taking
it upon themselves.

00:38:00.770 --> 00:38:01.750
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Well,
if every corporation

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:03.416
had a Milton Hershey,
then we'd probably

00:38:03.416 --> 00:38:05.199
live in a better place.

00:38:05.199 --> 00:38:06.740
Perfect story, I
mean I think there's

00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.520
a lot of those examples.

00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.910
AUDIENCE: Very, very applicable.

00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:09.320
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Yes.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:09.940
Yeah.

00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:11.192
All right, great.

00:38:11.192 --> 00:38:14.090
Well, I hope you
guys enjoyed the case

00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.250
and learned a little
bit about palm oil.

00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:20.970
So actually, one of the cases
we learned about in our research

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:24.280
about palm oil is that actually
two Girl Scouts found out

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:28.590
that palm oil was in
Girl Scout Cookies,

00:38:28.590 --> 00:38:32.530
and they actually campaigned
against their own institution

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:36.360
and brought a huge issue against
the Girl Scout Corporation

00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:38.490
of America, their own--
so it was actually

00:38:38.490 --> 00:38:41.510
internal agitation, it wasn't
an external environmental NGO,

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:42.980
and that became a huge thing.

00:38:42.980 --> 00:38:45.930
You guys should look it up,
it's a pretty funny story.

00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.290
AUDIENCE: Did they change it?

00:38:47.290 --> 00:38:47.780
ALEXIS BATEMAN: What's that?

00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:48.780
AUDIENCE: Did they change it?

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.113
ALEXIS BATEMAN: They did commit.

00:38:50.113 --> 00:38:52.630
They did commit, so they're
in the same conundrum, where

00:38:52.630 --> 00:38:54.940
they've done some, like a
certain percentage of RSPO

00:38:54.940 --> 00:38:55.700
certification.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.440
But the actual Girl Scouts who
started when they're like 10

00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.194
and are like now about 17
or something, they're like,

00:39:02.194 --> 00:39:04.610
no it's not enough, we want
you to have a higher standard.

00:39:04.610 --> 00:39:06.193
So they're still
pushing the internal.

00:39:06.193 --> 00:39:08.960
So it's a huge media thing.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:11.740
But there's-- you can see
where different agitation comes

00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:13.136
in within stakeholders.

00:39:13.136 --> 00:39:14.510
So actually, what
we were talking

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:17.585
about with the NGOs and the
different types of NGOs,

00:39:17.585 --> 00:39:19.460
you mentioned the
Environmental Defense Fund.

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:21.600
Actually, next week,
Environmental Defense Fund

00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:24.880
is going to come, and they can
talk to your point a little bit

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:27.236
about-- I'm sure
you can push them

00:39:27.236 --> 00:39:29.390
on some questions on
what kind of NGO they are

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:34.160
and the more corporate
partnerships style, way

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.690
of working that
they do, as opposed

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:38.390
to somewhere like Greenpeace
that just goes in usually

00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:40.100
to attack.

00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:42.520
So for the rest
of today I thought

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.400
I am going to just kind of
give you a brief overview.

00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:51.870
Anyone else have any
questions on the case study?

00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:53.290
AUDIENCE: You mentioned ethanol.

00:39:53.290 --> 00:39:57.310
Are there any studies that
compare palm oil to ethanol?

00:39:57.310 --> 00:40:00.160
I'm assuming there's
probably more corn used

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.060
in the world than palm oil.

00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:03.530
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Yeah.

00:40:03.530 --> 00:40:06.180
I don't know about the
relative quantities

00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:09.310
and I'm not sure if
there's a study comparing

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:10.790
the issues behind that.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:15.430
There's definitely different
issues in palm oil and ethanol,

00:40:15.430 --> 00:40:18.884
but I'd encourage you to look up
what's happening in the ethanol

00:40:18.884 --> 00:40:20.550
supply chain and
what's happening there,

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:22.580
but not off the top my head.

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:26.650
If I find one, though,
I'll send it to you.

00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:30.590
So I thought the palm oil
was a perfect example.

00:40:30.590 --> 00:40:34.600
It's like one of the most-- not
the most, but a very complex

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.370
example of multi-stakeholder
engagement.

00:40:37.370 --> 00:40:43.060
This is just a small perspective
on how many actual stakeholders

00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:43.940
are involved.

00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.680
Within each of
those subheadings,

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:49.900
there's multiple
corporations, multiple mills,

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:51.210
thousands of farmers.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:40:53.370
And so getting all
these people together

00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:55.140
to agree on different
certifications

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.880
and how they're going
to actually run that

00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:01.210
was incredibly complex, and
it's still very much ongoing.

00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:04.420
There's still a lot of debate,
external debate from the World

00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.980
Wildlife Federation
on the standards.

00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:09.780
A lot of different NGOs are
commenting on how it's going.

00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:12.700
So we actually covered--
some of the stories

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:16.740
that we've looked at and a lot
of the times when companies do

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:19.250
tend to commit to
multi-stakeholder engagements

00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:21.826
or realize that they have
a gap in their strategy,

00:41:21.826 --> 00:41:23.200
in their sustainability
strategy,

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.360
is when an NGO finds it.

00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.840
And so that's sort ot--
these are just two.

00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.680
So Nestle and Greenpeace is
what we talked about today,

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.730
where Greenpeace
activists actually

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:36.410
dropped into their shareholder
meeting dressed as gorillas

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:38.640
and totally blockaded the doors.

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.270
And there's other
examples of Greenpeace.

00:41:42.270 --> 00:41:45.610
I don't know if they rock
climbed or parachuted

00:41:45.610 --> 00:41:49.770
onto the top of HP and actually
spray painted toxic materials

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:51.757
on the top of HP because
they're attacking

00:41:51.757 --> 00:41:53.340
HP for some of the
materials that they

00:41:53.340 --> 00:41:57.290
were using in their supply chain
that were labeled as toxic.

00:41:57.290 --> 00:42:00.266
So they have some very
Interesting campaign tactics,

00:42:00.266 --> 00:42:02.140
but definitely get people
to look, especially

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:04.220
with the Nestle commercial.

00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.660
This actually was
a different case

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:10.180
where the Rainforest
Alliance Network actually

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:11.230
attacked Mitsubishi.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:13.890
So Mitsubishi is actually
three different companies.

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:15.280
There's a parent
company and then

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.900
there's Mitsubishi
Electric, and then

00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:20.250
there's Mitsubishi Automotive
which is probably what we're

00:42:20.250 --> 00:42:22.440
most familiar with, the cars.

00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:26.670
But actually the parent company
was sourcing paper products

00:42:26.670 --> 00:42:28.490
that were unsustainable,
and there's a lot

00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:30.160
of clear cutting of rainforest.

00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.110
And what happened was that they
just don't have a public face,

00:42:33.110 --> 00:42:34.950
so the Rainforest
Alliance Network actually

00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:37.430
decided to attack the
automotive company,

00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:41.291
even though they actually had
no connection to the paper

00:42:41.291 --> 00:42:41.790
sourcing.

00:42:41.790 --> 00:42:45.529
So this is where NGOs are
using different strategies

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:46.570
to get it into the media.

00:42:46.570 --> 00:42:49.920
So they actually had
sit-ins at the dealerships.

00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:52.490
And what happened was the
dealerships then called

00:42:52.490 --> 00:42:54.220
Mitsubishi Automotive
Electric and said,

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:55.890
we can't deal with this,
we're losing sales.

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.400
And then the
Mitsubishi executives

00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.025
across three different
parent companies

00:42:59.025 --> 00:43:01.950
had to actually decide
what they were going to do.

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:05.100
The sad story is that the
electric and the automotive

00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:08.021
actually committed to
paper sourcing policies

00:43:08.021 --> 00:43:09.520
and the parent
company still didn't,

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.936
because they couldn't get down
to the actual root problem.

00:43:11.936 --> 00:43:13.580
So that's some of
the perspective

00:43:13.580 --> 00:43:17.220
on how NGOs go about getting
into these complex problems

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.755
by pushing the hand of
the public brand owners.

00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:27.140
So one of the most
clear, simple ways

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:29.450
that companies are
engaging is when

00:43:29.450 --> 00:43:33.490
they realize that they
need help in increasing

00:43:33.490 --> 00:43:35.070
their sustainability.

00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.500
Chiquita actually
has-- I think they

00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:43.890
started in 1992 with the
Rainforest Alliance Network.

00:43:43.890 --> 00:43:47.610
They were getting
training and information

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:51.630
on how to grow their
bananas more sustainably,

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:54.730
so they're using the RAN to work
with their farmers and growers.

00:43:54.730 --> 00:43:58.190
And so they've actually
used them for over 20 years.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.805
Chiquita has sort
of a checkered past,

00:43:59.805 --> 00:44:03.634
so they obviously decided
they needed to have a partner.

00:44:03.634 --> 00:44:06.050
That was a one-on-one partner,
and they've actually worked

00:44:06.050 --> 00:44:08.910
with them for many years
to look at organic issues

00:44:08.910 --> 00:44:12.430
and Sustainable transportation
their products and all

00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:13.690
of the above.

00:44:13.690 --> 00:44:17.160
And actually, Chiquita
sought out Tony Craig

00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:19.490
to do their carbon
footprint, so they obviously

00:44:19.490 --> 00:44:20.650
need a lot of help.

00:44:20.650 --> 00:44:23.990
They were actually
looking to Tony

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:27.260
to assess their entire carbon
footprint of a single banana.

00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:29.270
So we'd talked
about that earlier.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.225
Other one-on-one
partnerships-- Dell-- who

00:44:32.225 --> 00:44:33.581
has a Dell computer in here?

00:44:33.581 --> 00:44:34.080
Anybody?

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:37.360
So a pretty big brand.

00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:40.000
They've actually-- one
of their major problems

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.530
that they were attacked
with was their e-waste.

00:44:42.530 --> 00:44:45.979
So what are they doing with
the end of life products?

00:44:45.979 --> 00:44:47.770
Several years ago, when
they were attacked,

00:44:47.770 --> 00:44:49.020
I think it was
about 10 years ago,

00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:50.186
they weren't doing anything.

00:44:50.186 --> 00:44:51.650
And so instead,
now, today they've

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:54.180
partnered with Goodwill
as a collection point.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:58.732
So the Goodwill can actually
collect Dell products,

00:44:58.732 --> 00:45:00.440
and they also collect
any other products.

00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.860
Actually, if you
guys look it up,

00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:03.370
you can turn your
e-waste in there,

00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.620
and actually Goodwill
collects those products

00:45:05.620 --> 00:45:09.410
and then Dell pays for the
actual recycling and separation

00:45:09.410 --> 00:45:12.950
of their computers so that
they don't go into landfills.

00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:15.810
These are one-on-one
partnerships

00:45:15.810 --> 00:45:19.240
where the company decided they
needed help with their strategy

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:21.100
and then they sought
out a partner that

00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.160
was a technical expert in that.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:27.260
In the case of Walmart and the
Environmental Defense Fund,

00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.040
you guys will get a
little bit more insight

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.360
into what they're doing
in their partnership.

00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:37.390
But when Walmart decided to
integrate a sustainability

00:45:37.390 --> 00:45:41.810
program about in 2005, so
almost 10 years ago, they

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:44.964
needed many partners, and they
need one strategic partner

00:45:44.964 --> 00:45:46.630
to kind of guide their
overall strategy.

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:48.640
So they brought in
Environmental Defense Fund

00:45:48.640 --> 00:45:50.400
to look at their
overarching strategies

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.020
and how they were going to
drive that into their business.

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.640
So EDF is actually a
really unique story.

00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:00.360
We're hoping to get the woman
that is actually co-located

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:01.910
with Walmart in Bentonville.

00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:04.900
Their offices are in
Bentonville, Arkansas,

00:46:04.900 --> 00:46:07.359
and obviously Walmart,
being one of the largest

00:46:07.359 --> 00:46:09.400
retailers in the world,
has a significant impact.

00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:12.120
So they actually co-located
their office there so

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:14.450
that they could have
a person on site

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.810
and work with different
Walmart individuals

00:46:16.810 --> 00:46:18.640
as they come along with
different problems.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:23.060
So that's sort of
a unique thing.

00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.180
These are examples
of one-on-one,

00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.340
where the company
decided they needed help,

00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.290
they sought out
a single partner.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:32.700
Other cases are
when a company has

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:35.570
a lot of different partners, and
this is true of many companies

00:46:35.570 --> 00:46:38.360
where they've decided
they needed support

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:40.090
in different angles.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.434
Starbucks, a major
coffee company, I'm sure

00:46:42.434 --> 00:46:43.600
you guys don't know of them.

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:48.660
But they have brought in a
lot of different partners.

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.060
In terms of how they're moving
their cups and other products

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:56.000
to more recyclable-- and
using more recycled material

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:57.490
in their actual
products, they've

00:46:57.490 --> 00:47:00.460
[INAUDIBLE] the Sustainable
Packaging Coalition.

00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:03.060
They've had other-- for
more of their social issues,

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:06.147
looking at helping
their farmers that

00:47:06.147 --> 00:47:07.730
grow their coffee
and their chocolate,

00:47:07.730 --> 00:47:10.610
and they've partnered
with Root Capital.

00:47:10.610 --> 00:47:13.120
In terms of how they're
actually integrating

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.720
recycling into
their sites, which

00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.710
has been an ongoing
problem, they've

00:47:16.710 --> 00:47:18.990
had working with the National
Recycling Correlation,

00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.950
and so forth.

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.120
So each of these
different angles

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:25.700
that they've found
a blind spot, they

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:28.870
sought out a partner so that
they can improve their strategy

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:31.060
and also have an
expert in that area,

00:47:31.060 --> 00:47:33.440
as opposed to
developing internally.

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.820
In some cases, some
companies choose

00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.820
to develop that
expertise internally.

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:40.280
So they bring in a
sustainability person

00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:42.370
that is an expert in
packaging, and that's

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:43.600
true of some companies.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.550
And some decide
that they don't want

00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:47.080
to develop that
internal expertise,

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.580
they'd rather seek
out someone who's

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:53.242
already a leader in that area.

00:47:53.242 --> 00:47:53.825
Any questions?

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:01.190
And then the last
kind of major bucket.

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:02.970
Of course, these
can all be split

00:48:02.970 --> 00:48:04.880
into many different hybrid.

00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:07.800
Some people have a
one-on-one collaboration

00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:09.227
and their industry
collaboration,

00:48:09.227 --> 00:48:11.060
or they have multiple
partners and industry.

00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:13.874
So everyone pretty much
just everything now,

00:48:13.874 --> 00:48:15.040
most of the major companies.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.730
So the other kind of
example would be an industry

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:20.070
collaboration, as we talked
about with the RSPO, where

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:24.240
they bring together
multiple stakeholders.

00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:26.770
They are this
convening a group that

00:48:26.770 --> 00:48:29.050
discusses the major
issues, and then they

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:32.090
may provide certification,
they may provide training,

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:35.060
they may provide information for
the company's stakeholders, all

00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:35.610
of the above.

00:48:35.610 --> 00:48:38.260
So that was-- RSPO
is one example.

00:48:38.260 --> 00:48:40.670
Another example is the
Sustainability Consortium.

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:44.220
Has anyone heard of the
Sustainability Consortium?

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:49.780
OK, so that's the biggest
one, so it's all downhill

00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:51.720
from there.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.880
The Sustainability Consortium
actually came out of Walmart.

00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.890
So Walmart realized
that they could only

00:48:58.890 --> 00:49:02.194
influence so much in terms
of their environmental impact

00:49:02.194 --> 00:49:03.360
within their own four walls.

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.780
They realized most other impact
was outside their four walls.

00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:10.570
They're buying P&G detergents,
they're buying Unilever shampoo

00:49:10.570 --> 00:49:14.450
and s and they realize all
their suppliers were actually

00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:15.850
a major source of the impact.

00:49:15.850 --> 00:49:17.680
So instead of just
trying to focus

00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:20.590
on their own internal impacts,
they pumped a bunch of money

00:49:20.590 --> 00:49:22.719
into making an
institution where all

00:49:22.719 --> 00:49:24.260
of these different
suppliers, as well

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.870
as other people from
across the industry,

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:28.490
could come together
and understand

00:49:28.490 --> 00:49:29.980
the impacts of products.

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:35.010
The actual outcome of it has
been kind of mixed and not

00:49:35.010 --> 00:49:36.950
totally successful,
but it has been

00:49:36.950 --> 00:49:38.900
a source of provision
for companies

00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:42.020
to learn how where the greatest
impacts in major products are.

00:49:42.020 --> 00:49:44.800
So they have different
product groups like shampoo,

00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.635
and understanding where the
biggest hot spots of impact, so

00:49:47.635 --> 00:49:50.160
that a company can address
that in their own supply chain.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.860
So sort of serving as an
intermediary of information

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.880
for all these
different stakeholders.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.730
Another one is the Electronic
Industry Citizenship Coalition,

00:49:58.730 --> 00:49:59.670
EICC.

00:49:59.670 --> 00:50:04.970
Pretty much every major
electronics group, Apple, Dell,

00:50:04.970 --> 00:50:07.900
they're all part of EICC,
and that serves in a couple

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:11.440
different ways of helping
companies certify their supply

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.830
chains, and things
like conflict minerals,

00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:17.074
understanding how to go
deep into their supply chain

00:50:17.074 --> 00:50:19.240
to make sure they're not
sourcing conflict minerals,

00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.360
or looking at alternatives.

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:23.420
Looking at social
issues on how actually

00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:26.390
the end of supply chain,
how social issues are

00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:27.930
working in manufacturing sites.

00:50:27.930 --> 00:50:30.770
I'm sure everyone heard
about Apple's issues

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:34.410
with suicides and other
issues at Foxconn.

00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:37.940
So that was a systemic
issue there that EICC

00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.050
has served as sort
of a middle ground

00:50:40.050 --> 00:50:41.800
on how to deal with
those kinds of issues,

00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.530
going in your supply
chain and certifying

00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:47.490
that your manufacturing
sites are of good condition.

00:50:47.490 --> 00:50:50.410
The last one is the
Sustainable Apparel Coalition.

00:50:50.410 --> 00:50:52.021
This is-- there's many of these.

00:50:52.021 --> 00:50:53.020
You could go on forever.

00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:53.853
There's quite a few.

00:50:53.853 --> 00:50:57.000
But this one in particular
is looking at clothes

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.860
and how you certify the
impact, how you calculate

00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:03.820
the impact of the clothes
that you're making,

00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.762
from the materials you're
using down to getting down

00:51:06.762 --> 00:51:07.470
to the consumers.

00:51:07.470 --> 00:51:10.960
So they've come together to
understand a tool so that they

00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.840
can know the impact there.

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:18.010
AUDIENCE: It seemed
like, say, ten years ago,

00:51:18.010 --> 00:51:21.030
companies actually tried to say,
hey, here's what we're doing.

00:51:21.030 --> 00:51:23.862
Then it seemed they all
stopped, because they were just

00:51:23.862 --> 00:51:24.570
getting hammered.

00:51:24.570 --> 00:51:27.430
If they said, hey,
we're doing this,

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:30.740
then they would get hammered on
five or 10 or 15 other things

00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:32.676
that they just were like,
well, that's stupid.

00:51:32.676 --> 00:51:34.416
I tried to say I'm
doing something right,

00:51:34.416 --> 00:51:36.040
and you just bludgeoned
me mercilessly.

00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:37.385
ALEXIS BATEMAN: You're talking
about the communication

00:51:37.385 --> 00:51:37.885
strategy?

00:51:37.885 --> 00:51:39.380
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
Walmart especially.

00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:41.990
Walmart came out and said,
OK, we're wrong on all fronts.

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:44.114
And then they said, here's
what we're trying to do,

00:51:44.114 --> 00:51:45.655
and then they actually
got hit again.

00:51:45.655 --> 00:51:47.690
But it seems like
they've all gone away

00:51:47.690 --> 00:51:51.010
from saying what they're doing
to just simply now touting

00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:52.970
products, like we
said, this product

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:55.080
is using certified this or that.

00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.750
So they focus now
simply on products

00:51:58.750 --> 00:52:02.640
versus the corporate hey,
look what we've done.

00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:05.315
It just seems like
they've all gotten away

00:52:05.315 --> 00:52:10.192
from trying to put themselves on
a pedestal and just gone, well,

00:52:10.192 --> 00:52:11.400
you can look at that product.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.295
That's a good product, if you
really want to buy something--

00:52:13.295 --> 00:52:13.960
ALEXIS BATEMAN: So sort of a--

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:14.920
AUDIENCE: They focus on that.

00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:16.850
ALEXIS BATEMAN: A case
of a perfect case or--

00:52:16.850 --> 00:52:18.885
AUDIENCE: I think that
the corporations found

00:52:18.885 --> 00:52:20.885
that you can't say you're
doing something right,

00:52:20.885 --> 00:52:22.968
because there's too many
people that will continue

00:52:22.968 --> 00:52:24.500
to kick you in the shins.

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:26.660
I think they'll just stop.

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:28.244
We're trying, but
trying doesn't work.

00:52:28.244 --> 00:52:29.118
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Sure.

00:52:29.118 --> 00:52:31.540
I mean, in our research
we found there's quite

00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:32.850
a few different strategies.

00:52:32.850 --> 00:52:35.820
So you have, if
you're a brown firm,

00:52:35.820 --> 00:52:38.590
brown for meaning you're not
doing anything environmentally

00:52:38.590 --> 00:52:43.190
sustainable, if you say what
you're doing and open up,

00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:45.860
then you're going to get
kudos, because you're brown.

00:52:45.860 --> 00:52:47.404
And then if there's
a neutral firm,

00:52:47.404 --> 00:52:48.570
it's going to go either way.

00:52:48.570 --> 00:52:52.780
So it's not clear if you're
doing some things but not

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.290
others, whether if you're more
transparent and communicating

00:52:55.290 --> 00:52:55.950
what you do.

00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:59.745
And then on the green side,
typically they can communicate,

00:52:59.745 --> 00:53:01.870
they're just kind of assumed
to be a green company.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:05.590
Has anyone seen with
their project companies

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:09.721
any issues with the
communication practices?

00:53:09.721 --> 00:53:11.220
How they thought
they went about it,

00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:13.011
they should have been
communicating it more

00:53:13.011 --> 00:53:15.016
or communicating it less?

00:53:15.016 --> 00:53:16.772
Any thoughts on that?

00:53:16.772 --> 00:53:18.200
No?

00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:20.980
Nobody communicated?

00:53:20.980 --> 00:53:23.920
Well, it's a good point.

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.950
Especially in some of these
industries, they get a label.

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:31.534
A lot of these
collaborations and NGOs,

00:53:31.534 --> 00:53:33.450
they get a label like
the Rainforest Alliance,

00:53:33.450 --> 00:53:36.220
you saw in Chiquita Banana,
they had their RAN sticker.

00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.869
And so sometimes companies
want to put that on there

00:53:38.869 --> 00:53:41.410
because they want the consumer
to think it's a green product.

00:53:41.410 --> 00:53:42.993
Some other companies
don't, because it

00:53:42.993 --> 00:53:44.070
confuses the consumers.

00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.611
So there's a lot of
different choices

00:53:45.611 --> 00:53:50.640
and how this goes about,
and how do you choose.

00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:53.060
So in terms of-- this
is just an example

00:53:53.060 --> 00:53:56.230
of what the Sustainability
Consortium does for companies,

00:53:56.230 --> 00:53:58.857
just showing you the
information source.

00:53:58.857 --> 00:54:00.690
There's a lot of text
up here, so don't even

00:54:00.690 --> 00:54:01.648
worry about reading it.

00:54:01.648 --> 00:54:04.090
But what they have
done is decided

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:10.502
to do a literature review on
different products and existing

00:54:10.502 --> 00:54:12.960
research and finding out where
the different hot spots are.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.790
So they provide
this information,

00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:18.150
this kind of hot spots
of where issues are.

00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:22.800
So this is on chemical bleach
use in pulp manufacturing,

00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:26.080
so in terms of paper, where
the major hot spots and impacts

00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:26.580
are.

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:30.500
They've done a review of
the existing information.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:34.489
They tell the companies
where the major impacts

00:54:34.489 --> 00:54:36.280
are so the companies
can be aware that when

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:38.100
they're looking at
their supply chain

00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:39.799
and then provide
them different KPIs

00:54:39.799 --> 00:54:41.840
that they can actually
use to measure the impact.

00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:45.670
So that's one example of how
an industry association might

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:48.120
provide information or
support for a company.

00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:51.660
Does that makes sense?

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:54.540
Just an example.

00:54:54.540 --> 00:54:57.820
So lastly, the
Environmental Defense Fund

00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:00.320
will be here next
week, so actually it'll

00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:02.479
give you a lot more insight
on how they actually

00:55:02.479 --> 00:55:04.270
go about partnerships
with their companies,

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:06.600
which will be really great.

00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:09.940
They actually put
out this report

00:55:09.940 --> 00:55:14.220
with the Global Environmental
Management Initiative, GEMI.

00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:19.710
There's a lot of confusion about
how NGOs partner with companies

00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:23.210
and how payment works and
how the collaboration works,

00:55:23.210 --> 00:55:25.710
which is an ongoing issue.

00:55:25.710 --> 00:55:28.280
So they talked
about, first of all,

00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.880
you've got to define your
overall objective that you

00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:31.610
need help with.

00:55:31.610 --> 00:55:33.860
So in the case of
Nestle, they decided

00:55:33.860 --> 00:55:36.360
they didn't know anything about
their palm oil supply chain,

00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:37.740
so they had to find a partner.

00:55:37.740 --> 00:55:39.805
So the Forest Trust
was a good partner.

00:55:39.805 --> 00:55:42.180
They were an expert in the
area and they brought them in.

00:55:42.180 --> 00:55:46.080
So it's very, very clear
what they needed help with.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.890
So then next would be
design the project.

00:55:49.890 --> 00:55:54.220
So what are the criteria, what
are the overall objectives

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:57.550
in increasing the
transparency, and who's

00:55:57.550 --> 00:55:58.770
a good partner for that?

00:55:58.770 --> 00:56:01.220
So there's a lot of seeking
out the different experts

00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:04.900
in that area, as well
as project execution.

00:56:04.900 --> 00:56:06.860
So on the company
side, there has

00:56:06.860 --> 00:56:09.430
to be someone who is the
direct contact for the NGO

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:11.844
that's going to provide
them information.

00:56:11.844 --> 00:56:14.260
I don't know if you guys watched
a lot of the Forest Trust

00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:18.130
videos or not, but Scott
Poynton, who's the founder,

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:21.856
he's very vocal, and I talked to
him in interviews several times

00:56:21.856 --> 00:56:23.480
now, and he's very
vocal about the fact

00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:26.841
that they're not
a pay-and-go NGO.

00:56:26.841 --> 00:56:28.590
They don't want companies
just giving them

00:56:28.590 --> 00:56:31.210
cash so they can say they're
working with the Forest Trust.

00:56:31.210 --> 00:56:34.742
They're very much going to push
them on what they need to do

00:56:34.742 --> 00:56:36.700
and they're not going to
let them get off easy.

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:39.120
So there's different
kinds of NGOs,

00:56:39.120 --> 00:56:41.580
where some might be just
willing to take some cash

00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.832
and be sort of a
figure project lead

00:56:43.832 --> 00:56:45.540
and say they're working
with the company,

00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.919
whereas other NGOs are
much more hard hitting.

00:56:47.919 --> 00:56:49.460
Case of Greenpeace,
they don't really

00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:51.918
want to work with anyone, they
just want to push companies.

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:57.840
Finally, one challenge will be
the measuring of communication.

00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.970
A lot of companies sometimes
are reluctant partner,

00:56:59.970 --> 00:57:02.470
because what are
the actual outcomes?

00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:04.460
Vague, nebulous outcomes.

00:57:04.460 --> 00:57:08.010
At the end, we talked
about some risk strategy,

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:11.100
which is a very apparent
and necessary thing,

00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:13.750
but what are the actual
measurable outputs

00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:16.430
for a company at that time
sometimes ends up here.

00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:24.021
So these are major themes of
how stakeholder engagement can

00:57:24.021 --> 00:57:24.520
happen.

00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.160
And so- we will have-- yeah?

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:32.275
AUDIENCE: So we have so many
certification bodies and so

00:57:32.275 --> 00:57:33.610
many different standards.

00:57:33.610 --> 00:57:34.980
Some of them can be paid off.

00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:36.810
You can buy some of
these certifications.

00:57:36.810 --> 00:57:40.550
Is there any policing
body or any audit of these

00:57:40.550 --> 00:57:43.145
certification bodies that
actually pull down those that

00:57:43.145 --> 00:57:47.546
aren't really-- because
for a consumer, it's--

00:57:47.546 --> 00:57:48.920
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Sure, absolutely.

00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:53.070
I mean, it's a very--
there's Eco Label Index.

00:57:53.070 --> 00:57:57.210
There's actually a group
that compiles all the labels

00:57:57.210 --> 00:57:58.040
around the world.

00:57:58.040 --> 00:57:59.706
I think the last time
I checked, there's

00:57:59.706 --> 00:58:03.110
like 440 labels around the
world in 30 industries.

00:58:03.110 --> 00:58:05.857
So it's a ridiculous amount
of labels, and most of them

00:58:05.857 --> 00:58:06.690
don't mean anything.

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:10.420
There are within, most within
the United States and Europe,

00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:15.160
there are marketing bodies
with the government that

00:58:15.160 --> 00:58:18.410
can regulate if they feel
there's some greenwashing

00:58:18.410 --> 00:58:21.200
or if there is the actual
label isn't actually

00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:24.170
providing the certification
these standards it is.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:26.000
But the fact of the
matter is that there

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.850
is very little regulation.

00:58:28.850 --> 00:58:30.414
Some of these
marketing regulations

00:58:30.414 --> 00:58:31.330
contradict themselves.

00:58:31.330 --> 00:58:34.590
So unfortunately there's very
little in the form of that,

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:35.090
absolutely.

00:58:35.090 --> 00:58:40.200
But I do see some of the
labels becoming defunct.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.850
I actually found a label
that was called Green Label,

00:58:42.850 --> 00:58:45.890
and then you just had to go
in and type in that you had,

00:58:45.890 --> 00:58:47.360
you know, fluorescent
light bulbs,

00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:48.820
and that people carpooled.

00:58:48.820 --> 00:58:50.440
And then you could get a
label for your product,

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.648
and that's all you had to do.

00:58:51.648 --> 00:58:55.058
So there's certainly a
huge range of the rigor.

00:58:55.058 --> 00:58:56.641
AUDIENCE: I wonder
if there are things

00:58:56.641 --> 00:58:58.205
we can learn from
the organic farming,

00:58:58.205 --> 00:59:00.470
because they appear to be a
little more stable and more

00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:01.428
regulated on that side.

00:59:01.428 --> 00:59:04.570
So if there's anything that we
can learn from them and apply?

00:59:04.570 --> 00:59:06.810
ALEXIS BATEMAN: Yeah,
organic is a perfect example.

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:09.550
They've been around
for quite a few years,

00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:12.710
so there are also challenges
within the organic label.

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:15.290
The good thing about
organic is that's recognized

00:59:15.290 --> 00:59:18.370
and people understand, for
the most part, what it means.

00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:23.700
The challenge now in that is
that now the USDA is actually

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:27.090
accepting more materials
that can be certified organic

00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:29.860
that a lot of different
bodies don't feel

00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:32.110
should be able to be
classified organic.

00:59:32.110 --> 00:59:37.420
Because they're trying
to certify organic baking

00:59:37.420 --> 00:59:40.040
products, which has a lot
more inputs, as opposed

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:42.470
to an apple or a different
fruit or vegetable.

00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:45.680
So we could definitely--
we should talk, actually,

00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:49.450
at the-- later on, we're going
to have a sustainability supply

00:59:49.450 --> 00:59:51.779
chain strategy
discussion and I'll

00:59:51.779 --> 00:59:53.320
talk about organic
a little bit more,

00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:55.670
and some of the
labels challenges

00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:58.150
on what is happening in
some of these spaces.

00:59:58.150 --> 01:00:00.370
I think that'd be
a great discussion.

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:04.205
Another label that's well
recognized is Energy Star.

01:00:04.205 --> 01:00:05.580
Do you guys all
know Energy Star?

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:09.870
So there are few labels that are
being for the industry standard

01:00:09.870 --> 01:00:11.870
and they're kind of
consolidating around that.

01:00:11.870 --> 01:00:14.730
And so there are
some evidence where

01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:17.900
there is to go to label that
is seen as rigor and the labels

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.790
that people don't recognize.

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:22.950
So in that way, companies are
consolidating what they use

01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:24.700
and how they communicate
their strategies.

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.366
So we could talk about
that, definitely,

01:00:26.366 --> 01:00:27.880
later on in this course.

01:00:30.470 --> 01:00:31.980
I think that's it for today.

01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:35.980
Maybe we should talk about
what else we have due.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:37.190
What do we have due, Tony?

01:00:37.190 --> 01:00:38.222
Do we have anything due?

01:00:38.222 --> 01:00:38.930
You have no idea.

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.030
so let's just look
at it, because I

01:00:46.030 --> 01:00:47.100
know that we've been--

01:00:53.800 --> 01:00:56.044
So today was the
palm oil case study,

01:00:56.044 --> 01:01:02.030
so we have-- what do we have?

01:01:02.030 --> 01:01:04.100
Homework?

01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:06.284
I think next week you
guys are sort of--

01:01:06.284 --> 01:01:07.200
does anyone else know?

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:09.366
I think you're off the hook
for something next week.

01:01:09.366 --> 01:01:12.240
It's-- oh, you have something?

01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:12.740
OK.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:13.490
Well, that's good.

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:14.990
I wanted to-- oh, OK.

01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.790
Deliverable-- OK.

01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:16.789
You're not off the hook.

01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:18.920
I'm sorry.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:24.540
Project deliverable number--
yes, one week from today,

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.160
and then we're going
to make that-- so we're

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.350
going to do a 10 AM.

01:01:28.350 --> 01:01:29.787
Everyone OK with
this so we know?

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:31.370
Do we have a due
date already on that?

01:01:31.370 --> 01:01:33.876
No.

01:01:33.876 --> 01:01:35.500
AUDIENCE: It's already
on the schedule.

01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:36.416
ALEXIS BATEMAN: It is?

01:01:36.416 --> 01:01:37.991
OK.

01:01:37.991 --> 01:01:38.490
All right.

01:01:38.490 --> 01:01:42.279
So just plan for that,
that'll be your homework.

01:01:42.279 --> 01:01:44.570
So next week, we're going to
have Environmental Defense

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:47.566
Fund, so make sure you guys
get here bright and early.

01:01:47.566 --> 01:01:49.440
Well, not bright and
early, in the afternoon.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.470
But--

01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:52.904
AUDIENCE: For the
lecture on the 30th,

01:01:52.904 --> 01:01:56.760
we have Noelle Selin, who's a
professor in the Engineering

01:01:56.760 --> 01:01:57.950
Systems division.

01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:59.950
There may be some reading
to go along with that,

01:01:59.950 --> 01:02:01.515
just to prepare for it.

01:02:01.515 --> 01:02:03.265
And we'll post those
in the announcements.

01:02:03.265 --> 01:02:06.314
She's putting that together,
so we'll let you know.

01:02:06.314 --> 01:02:07.730
ALEXIS BATEMAN:
Yeah, so just make

01:02:07.730 --> 01:02:09.520
sure to check Stellar
in the next week.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:12.451
So you'll have the deliverable
and some others readings.

01:02:12.451 --> 01:02:12.950
All right.

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.140
Thanks, guys.

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.070
See you guys on Monday.

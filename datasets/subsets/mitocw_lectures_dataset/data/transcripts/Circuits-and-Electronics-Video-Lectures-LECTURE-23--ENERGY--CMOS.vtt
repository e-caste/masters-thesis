WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
All right, let's get moving.
Good morning.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let me take a quick poll.
So, how many of you have

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
completed Lab 4.
Completed Lab 4?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Wow, that's great.
So, how many people have begun

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Lab 4?
OK, well that's good.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I won't ask the last question.
OK so, well I hope you're

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
having fun with this lab.
Lab 4 was designed to be almost

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
like a mini-project.
And, it sort of ties together a

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
lot of the content of the entire
course.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And, it's not unlike the kind
of systems that people design in

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
industry, in systems that go
into a variety of devices like,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
say, for example,
digital CD players and stuff

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000
like that.
A lot of mixed signal stuff

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
goes in.
OK, so today,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I'm going to continue with our
discussion of energy and CMOS.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:34.000
CMOS will be a new topic that I
will introduce.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So, the last lecture,
we spent a fair bit of time

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
talking about energy,
and how to compute the energy

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
of our inverter.
So, let me start from where I

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
left off, and I've given you a
couple of extra pages of notes

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
today just to sort of tie it to
the previous lecture.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Right now, I'm going to start
off on page three.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
So, what we saw last time was
an inverter of this sort,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Vs, VIN, and we said,
let's study the situation where

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
this inverter was driving a load
capacitor, C.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Where did this load capacitor
come from?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Well, this inverter could be
driving one, or two,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000
or three, or four other larger
gates, OK?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So, this C is lumped value of
the gate capacitances of all of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
those inverters.
This may also include some

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
component due to wiring
capacitance and stuff like that.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000
So, for an inverter like this,
we showed in the last lecture

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that the formula for the average
power was,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
so this was a static power
independent of frequency,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
and this was called dynamic
power, and it had some bearing,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
it's related to the frequency
at which you clocked your

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
circuit.
So, this was related to standby

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
power, and this to dynamic.
So, what I also said is that I

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:38.000
gave you a bunch of numbers so
you could compute the power

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
consumption of a chip that
included 10^8 gates,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000
100 million gates,
and at a frequency of 1 GHz,

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and a bunch of other numbers.
C was given to be 0.1

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
femtofarads.
Femto is 10^-15.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So, F was 10^9.
VS was 5V, and for these

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
numbers, if you plonk them down
in something like this,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:25.000
for 10^8 gates on a chip,
the average power would be 10^8

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:32.000
times these two.
So, this would be five squared,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
which is 25,
divided by twice.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
RL was given to be 10
kilo-ohms, so,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
twice, 10^4.
And here we had CVS^2.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000
So, C was 10^-16,
0.1 femtofarads.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Vs^2 was 25,
and F was 10^9.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
So, if you commence through the
numbers here,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:20.000
what you end up getting is
something that looks like this,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
10^8 times this guy here.
This is 1.25mW plus this guy

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.000
ends up being 2.5 microwatts.
So, this should come as a bit

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
of a shocker.
If I take 1.25mW,

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
and multiply that out by 10^8,
this says that each gate

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000
suffers a standby power loss of
1.25mW.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
So times 10^8,
I get 125kW,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and this guy yields 250W.
OK, the 250W is manageable.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
It's still high,
and just so you don't think

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000
that this is unreasonable,
when the Pentium 4 first came

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000
out, it was consuming 170W of
power.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000
OK, you should see the heat
sinks on there.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
There's actually a huge heat
sink with a fan built into the

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
top of the heat sink.
OK, today it's down to more

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
reasonable numbers like 100W and
so on, but when it came out it

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
was in this range.
So it's high but not

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
unreasonable.
But this, of course,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000
is totally wacko.
OK, imagine carrying a laptop

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
around, and the sucker is
blowing 125kW.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
That'll be fun.
So, clearly there's something

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
wrong here.
What this is saying is that

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000
this gate here consumes 125kW,
there are 10^8 of these on a

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000
single chip.
OK, so we clearly have to do

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000
something about this,
otherwise the semiconductor

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
industry would fail.
So, anybody have any ideas?

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
What do you think you might do
here?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000
What do you think you might do
to this inverter to make this

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
look better, to bring it down?
What can I do?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000
Anybody?
Any ideas?

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
What do you think?
Well, the problem is that if I

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000
look at this 125kW,
well, there's a VS term here

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
and an RL term here.
So, I can increase RL.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
OK, I can make RL four times or
eight times as large.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
That'll bring the power down
somewhat.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Can anybody think of any
problem with increasing RL?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
If I make RL really,
really large,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
will I run into other problems?
Yes?

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Exactly, the slowdown of the
inverter.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Remember, the rise time of the
inverter depends on how quickly

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000
I can charge this capacitor
through RL.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000
So, if I make my RL really
large, I will consume less

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000
standby power from hundreds of
kilowatts to merely tens of

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
kilowatts.
But my gates will run as slow

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000
as molasses.
So, clearly that's not a

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
tradeoff I would like to make.
So, I can reduce my voltage to

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000
maybe a volt.
But that just reduces it by a

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
factor of 25,
VS squared.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000
So clearly, this is not going
to work.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I have to somehow do something
else, and that will be the topic

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
of today's lecture.
Also, I will dwell for a moment

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
on this term.
So, if you look at the spec

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000
sheet for the IBM's ASIC
processor that we handed out,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
if you recall,
we talked about power

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000
dissipation of 0.006 microwatts
per MHz per gate.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000
OK, now you see where this is
coming from.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Per MHz, that's because it's a
multiple of f,

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
the power.
Second is that it's per gate,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
so this is the power per gate.
So, as I have more gates,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
I just have that much more
power dissipation.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000
It also says power supply
voltage in the range of 0.7 to

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
1.3 right next to the power
expression.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
So, you can see why they tell
you all of that,

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
because both voltage,
and the frequency,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000
and the number of gates come
into the power of equation.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.000
OK, this really simple
expression here,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
it's amazing how close this is
to what people use for the

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
dynamic power in chips.
OK, so as the next step,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
what I'd like to do is,
this guy, what do we do about

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.000
that?
OK, so we've taught you to

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:13.000
build gates in a particular
matter, but it's a non-starter.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
So, how do we get rid of static
power?

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
How do we get rid of static
power?

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
OK, to do so,
let's build up a little bit of

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000
intuition.
OK, so the intuition goes as

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
follows.
So let's say I take my

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000
inverter.
Let me draw the circuit both on

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.000
the on state and in the off
state.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000
So, when VIN is high,
when VIN is high,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
I get the MOSFET turning on and
has a resistance,

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000
RON, and Vo is the output
voltage.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Similarly, when VIN is low,
so when VIN was high,

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Vo was low because RON is much
less than RL.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:27.000
So, this voltage was low,
while here, when VIN is low,

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:34.000
the MOSFET is off,
and so I have an open circuit

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:39.000
out here.
And because of that open

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
circuit, the voltage here was
going to be high because VS

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
would simply appear there.
So let's tailor this and see if

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
we can build up some intuition
as to what to do.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
So, when VIN is low,
I don't have any static power

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000
being dissipated because I don't
have a connection from VS to

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
ground.
OK, the current,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
i, is zero.
And, VS simply appears at the

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
output.
The reason this is so is have a

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.000
switch here.
So when this is low,

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000
the switch opens up and cuts
the path from power to ground.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000
This is a nice situation.
Here, when VIN was high,

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.000
there was no switch that turns
off.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Rather, I get a connection from
VS to ground.

00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000
OK, so think about this
situation here.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
The insight here is,
just imagine if I could do the

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
following.
Imagine if I could somehow

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
magically elevate RL to be a
very, very, very large number,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
if I could make this so high as
to make the power really low

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
only in the situation when the
input was high,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000
OK?
So, imagine if I could do

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000
something like this.
Imagine I could open circuit

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000
this guy, RON,
so when VIN was high,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:07.000
if I could, instead of having
an RL here, what if somehow I

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000
could make this RL become
infinity?

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:15.000
OK, so in this case,
output VO would be low.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000
OK, I get many benefits by
doing this.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000
One benefit is that,
look, I have opened this switch

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000
here so I don't have any standby
current.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000
OK, the standby current is
zero.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
The second benefit is that my
output gets dragged down to

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000
ground, OK?
Out here, my output was VS

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
multiplied by RON divided by the
sum of these two.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Out here, I have a direct
connection to ground,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
and nothing to the power
supply, VS, and so therefore I

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
have a nice, solid low.
So the question is that,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
can I get this situation?
OK, that is a key insight.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So, imagine that somehow,
when this was high,

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
I could get this to open up,
much like when this was low,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
I got this to open up.
OK, so think about it.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
So, the intuition is that what
I need instead of a resistor

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
here, what if I have something
like the MOSFET that I have

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
here?
So, I have a MOSFET here that

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000
turned off when VIN was low.
OK, what if I did the

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
complementary thing?
What if I put in some kind of

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
MOSFET here that would turn off
when VIN was high?

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.000
OK, so, much like the MOSFET
turned off when VIN was low down

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:47.000
here, imagine if I could find a
device that could turn off when

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.000
VIN was high?
OK, this would be on,

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.000
but this would be off.
So the behavior of this device

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
would have to be complementary
to this device.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000
So, we need some sort of a
switch to introduce this new,

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:12.000
little MOSFET device with
slightly different properties,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000
let me quickly review for you
the properties of the MOSFET

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
that we know about,
so our N channel MOSFET,

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.000
also called the NFET,
this is what we've been seeing

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000
all this while,
is drawn like this.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
I have a gate;
I have a drain;

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I have a source.
And this guy is on when VGS is

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:52.000
greater than or equal to VT,
OK, and off when VGS is less

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000
than VT.
You saw this before,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.000
OK, nothing new here.
So, what I need is a device

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
that behaves in a complementary
manner.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
OK, so the device is a P
channel MOSFET.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000
By the way, I must point out,
till about 1983-84 until the

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:24.000
early '80s, that's exactly
pretty much how chips were

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
designed, OK,
using an NFET for the switch

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
looking down here,
and a variety of different

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:40.000
kinds of devices to be used as
resistors.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.000
OK, that's when technology
began moving towards this new

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000
kind of technology I'm going to
talk about, and that

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000
dramatically reducing the power
consumed.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
And, the P channel MOSFET was
created, and this guy's called

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000
the PFET.
It's a complementary device

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000
that looks as follows.
OK, the difference here is

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.000
that, to show this is
complementary,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I'll put a little circle here.
It has a gate.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Just to make things a little
clearer, flip the drain and

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
source terminals,
and this guy is on at a

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:22.000
distinguished threshold voltage
of this with the NFET device,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000
let me put an N here to say
that this is the VT for the N

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000
channel device.
And for this guy,

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
this guy came on when VGS was
greater than some voltage.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
So, VTN could be,
for example,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
one volt.
So, VGS was more than one.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
This turned on.
In this case,

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:49.000
I wanted this to turn on when
VGS is some value which is lower

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
than, or much lower than,
the source voltage.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:18:00.000
OK, so this guy turns on when
the gate voltage is higher.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
This guy should turn on when
the gate voltage is

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
significantly lower than the
source voltage,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.000
just the complementary
behavior.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000
OK, so when VGS is less than or
equal to VTP.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
And in this case,
the threshold voltage for the

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
PMOS device, say,
just as an example,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
maybe -1V.
So this means that if the

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
source is at,
say, 5V, OK,

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
then this device would turn on
if the gate, for example,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
using that example was less
than 4V.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
So, this is five.
If the gate fell below 4V,

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
this guy would turn on.
In this situation,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000
remember, if this was at zero,
the gate would have to be

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
greater than 1V to turn on.
In this situation,

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000
the gate has to be less than 4V
if the source was at five to

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
turn on.
And, it's off.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000
OK, so this is a complementary
device that I postulate that

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
behaves in a complementary
manner.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
So, the gate voltage rises,
this guy turns on,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
and in this situation,
when the gate voltage drops

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
below the source voltage,
this guy turns on.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000
OK, so when there's a rising
guy that turns on in this

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
particular situation when it
falls, the gate turns on and

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
shows some resistance.
In this case,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000
the resistance would be RON.
And to show that it's N

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000
channel, let me say N.
And in this case,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000
the resistance,
when it turns on,

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:44.000
would be RONp to represent P
channel.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
OK, so now consider the
following circuit for the

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
inverter.
So, instead of my resistor,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I put a complementary device,
OK, and that's it.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
So all I've done here is
replace my resistor with a

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000
MOSFET that behaves
complementary to the N channel

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
MOSFET.
So this is my gate,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000
my drain.
This is my source,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
my gate, my source,
and my drain.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000
OK, and this guy is called a
pull up, and this guy is called

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000
a pull down.
OK, and the reason is that this

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000
guy pulls the output to ground
when it's turned on,

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000
while this guy,
when switched on,

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.000
will pull this node up to VS.
So, I pull it down or pull it

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000
up based on when the VIN is high
or low.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.000
So, let's look at the two
situations.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
So, let's say,
as an example,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
my VS is 5V,
and let's say VIN in one

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
situation being 5V,
and another situation being

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
equal to 0V.
Let's draw the equivalent

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.000
circuit in both these cases.
So, when VIN is high,

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:22.000
I have my usual circuit.
When VIN is high,

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000
this MOSFET,
as before, when VIN is 5V,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000
the N channel MOSFET below is
turned on, and so I have an RON

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
resistance here.
But remember,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
VIN is 5, and VS is 5V,
then the voltage across the

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
source and the gate of this P
channel FET is now equal,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000
five and five.
OK, so this one would turn off.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
And that's the circuit that I
get.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
The output is suitably low.
In this situation,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000
if VIN is zero,
what happens in this situation?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
Here's my output.
If VIN is 0V,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
the lower device turns off.
This is zero.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
This is zero.
This guy turns off,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000
and that's the situation for
the N channel MOSFET.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000
How about this guy here?
What happens here?

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
This is at 5.
So let me just,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
this is at 5V.
OK, and VIN is at 0V.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
OK, so therefore,
the GS of this is -5V.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000
If this is zero and this is
five, G, source,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:59.000
and drain, GS is -5V,
and -5V is significantly less

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:06.000
than the threshold -1V in our
example.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
So, this one will switch on.
And if this one switches on,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
what I end up getting is RONp
out there.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000
So, when this one kicks in,
it pulls the output high and VO

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000
goes high.
So, all I've done is replaced

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:36.000
my resistor with a complementary
device, which switches off when

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000
the input is high,
and switches on when the input

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:46.000
is low.
And the beauty of this is that

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
at no point, assuming all the
devices are ideal here,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000
at no point do I have a short
circuit between the output,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
do I have a current path from
the output to the ground from

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
the supply to ground,
OK, I have this turned off or

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:09.000
this turned off.
So, this type of logic

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:18.000
involving a PMOS transistor
here, and the N channel

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:25.000
transistor here is called CMOS
logic for, OK,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
it's called complementary MOS
logic.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:39.000
That's what CMOS comes from.
OK, so I'm sure you've read in

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000
a number of places that most
digital chips today use CMOS

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
technology.
It comes from complementary

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
MOS, and complementary comes
from the use of complementary

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
transistors: N channel,
P channel, turns on when high,

00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.000
turns off when high,
turns off when low,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
turns on when low.
OK, that's exactly

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000
complementary to each other.
OK, so what you've seen here

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:13.000
has been the workhorse of the
digital industry for the past

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
two decades, 20 years,
CMOS logic.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
OK, and even the most advanced
chip from Intel has an inverter

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
that looks exactly like that.
OK, if you count all the

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000
inverters in the universe today,
I would say a significant

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000
fraction of those look exactly
like that, no difference,

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:42.000
just so simple.
So, the key with something like

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000
that is there is no path from
the power supply to the ground,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
and so by that model,
I did not consume any standby

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000
power.
OK, my standby power in that

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
idealized model is zero.
So, let's compute P.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
So, what is P dynamic?
Let's use the method that we

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
adopted in the last lecture,
and draw the equivalent

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
circuit, and compute the power.
OK, so I'm going to model the

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:24.000
following situation,
and assume that I drive a

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000
capacitive load,
C.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
OK, and as an input,
as I did the last time,

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
I'm going to assume I have some
input voltage,

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000
VIN, that looks like this.
The cycle time,

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:53.000
T, and the frequency is 1/t,
and let me assume that this is

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000
T1, and this is T2.
OK, and I'm assuming that T1

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:09.000
and T2 are both much larger than
the respective time constants.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
OK, the time constants when,
for discharging here,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
is C RONn, and here the
relevant resistance is RONp.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:23.000
The charging time constant is
RONp times C.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000
OK, so T1 and T2 are assumed to
be much greater than these two.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000
So when you look at this,
there's one other benefit

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
besides the power benefit,
OK, of using CMOS logic

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
compared to using NMOS.
OK, it not only cuts out my

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
standby power,
but there is another

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000
significant advantage which is
almost equal to the power

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
advantage of this kind of CMOS
technology.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Anybody have any ideas?
What's the advantage?

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.000
What does intuition tell you?
Is CMOS going to be faster or

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
slower than NMOS?
Why?

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
That's right.
The key here is that the NMOS

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:16.000
design I showed you earlier was
relatively slow because it took

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000
me a while to charge up the load
capacitor from RL.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
In this situation,
RL will become really,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
really small;
it's RONp.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:32.000
It's roughly the same magnitude
as RONm.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
OK, if so both of these on
resistances are more or less

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
equal and small,
then the rise time will be of

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.000
the same order of magnitude as
the fall time,

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
which makes this much faster
than the NMOS.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
In NMOS, my time constant was
RLC, and RL was pretty large.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
In this case it's RONp C,
and RONp can be made to be very

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.000
small because when it's switched
off, the resistance here is

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000
infinity.
So, in this situation,

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
if I assume T1 and T2 are much
larger than the respective time

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
constants, I can go ahead and
draw my equivalent circuit.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
So, here's VS.
So, for charging up,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
let's say this one is going to
a one, or to a high.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
So, I have VS going through a
resistor, RONp,

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.000
to a capacitor,
and this thing is a switch.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
So I have RONp,
an ideal switch,

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000
going to a capacitor,
C, this is my V out node,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:46.000
OK, so it's VS going through a
resistance, RONp,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
an ideal switch,
to a capacitor,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
C.
That's a charging circuit.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:30:00.000
For discharging,
I have C, discharging through

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.000
an ideal switch with RONn.
So, this situation,

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
I have an ideal switch,
RONn.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:20.000
OK, so that's the equivalent
circuit for something like this.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:27.000
So, in this circuit,
during T1, this guy's off,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
and this guy's on,
on during T1,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000
and off otherwise.
This guy is on during T2,

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
and off otherwise.
OK, so just imagine,

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:45.000
this guy switches on,
this guy switches off,

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
this guy switches on,
this guy switches off,

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000
OK?
And remember,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:56.000
this is exactly the circuit I
had analyzed last time in the

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
last lecture,
and the result given by v

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
double asterisk.
And that result was simply

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
average power being CVS^2f.
That's the exact circuit we

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
used to compute the dynamic
power, CVS^2f.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
OK, so we're done.
And how did this come about?

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000
This came about because the
intuition here is that I'm

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:26.000
charging up the capacitor fully,
and then I'm discharging the

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
capacitor through this other
side, OK, and I'm consuming

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000
power, dissipating power,
in these two resistances during

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
charge up and during the
discharge.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Half the power gets consumed
during charge up,

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
and half during the discharge.
So, I'd like to go back to

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000
doing a few numbers here,
and taking a look at how,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:59.000
even with this expression,
life can get pretty thorny as

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:04.000
we go ahead into the next
decade.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:15.000
OK, so for our previous
example, we assumed that 10^8

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
gates, F=1 GHz,
C=0.1 femtofarads,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:32.000
VS was 5V, and I don't need RL
anymore.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
OK, why is it that I don't have
any resistance component here?

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
I don't have it here because
the power consumed by this

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
circuit is independent of those
resistances, provided T1 and T2

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
are long enough,
are much longer than the two

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:50.000
time constants,
RONp C, and RONn C.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
OK, so I don't have RL in my
equation anymore.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:33:00.000
I don't have any standby power.
So, based on this calculation,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:08.000
the calculation I did up there
showed that I had 2.5 microwatts

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:16.000
per gate, and for 10^8 gates I
had 250W for a chip with 10^8

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
gates.
So, I'd like to dwell on this,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:27.000
if you can move over to page
eight in your notes,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
here.
Let me dwell on this for some

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.000
time, and pontificate on a few
things.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
First of all,
this number,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000
as I said before,
is high, but not a disaster.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
OK, so you can't use this in
laptops, but it's quite OK for a

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
desktop or a server,
and so on.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
If you just go and put your ear
to a pedestal computer,

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
you'll always hear it making a
sound, and that sound is because

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:07.000
of a big fan that's inside it.
And, if you have a big enough

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
fan, 250W is not such a big
deal.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:17.000
But, this is certainly a real
problem for mobile devices.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
For a laptop,
this is unthinkable.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.000
OK, so we have to deal with
this.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000
The second issue is the
following, that it's 250W for

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
1GHz.
Now, the fastest Pentium 4s

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
that money can by today are,
what, how many GHz?

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
What's the fastest Pentium 4
you can buy today?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
What's that?
Does anybody have a 4GHz

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Pentium 4 here?
Oh, darn, you beat me.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Anybody have a 3?
3GHz?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
A couple.
So, I have a couple of 3GHz

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:03.000
machines, and our lab has a
whole ton of them.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000
So, if Intel comes out with
4GHz machines today,

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
they've been going up by about
1GHz roughly every year for the

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000
past couple of years.
And, within three or four

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000
years, you're going to see
chips, microprocessors that are

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
in the 5-10GHz range,
OK, assuming that all other

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
things stay equal,
which of course they're not,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
but just to give you some
insight here,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
if I clock these guys and build
circuits that are ten times

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
faster, I very soon go up to
2.5kW, again as I said,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
all things being equal which
they're not.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000
But just to give you a sense,
as I increase my frequency,

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
so does the power consumed by
the chip, OK?

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
So, I really have to do
something here.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:55.000
So, if I stare at this
equation, CVS^2f,

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
I want to increase f because
people will buy computers if I

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
have higher frequencies.
And, Intel has managed to use

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
its marketing campaigns to
pretty much convince consumers

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000
that high frequencies are a good
thing.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
OK, and whether they really
mean anything or not,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
that's a different issue.
So, we've got this huge power

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
for assuming 5V,
OK, so it turns out that

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
microprocessors,
as they come out,

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
newer and newer versions run at
lower and lower voltages.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
OK, they invent technologies
that use lower and lower

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000
voltages, and go from VS 5V to,
today, VS on the order of 1.5

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:44.000
to 1V, somewhere in that range.
So the moment you do that,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
you get a 25x reduction in
power.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
OK, so in going from 2.5kW,
you would now come down to

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:56.000
something on the order of 100W,
which is, again,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
much more reasonable,
again, all other things being

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000
equal.
It turns out that the

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:07.000
capacitance of devices also
changes as you go to smaller and

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
smaller devices.
And, 100W is also pretty high,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
and still not good enough for
mobile computers.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
So, there are many,
many other tricks that people

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
use to get even lower powers.
One trick is to play games with

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
the clock.
OK, what you do is,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
let's say for example in some
computation you are not going to

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
be using your floating point
unit.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Or let's say I'm going to be
using your integer adder unit.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
OK, so what you can do is you
can turn off the clock to those

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
devices so that those devices do
not even switch when they're not

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
working.
OK, if I turn off the clock to

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:46.000
a device, the device isn't even
going to switch,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
it's just going to sit there in
limbo without consuming any

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
power.
It's equivalent to turning off

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000
both transistors.
If you turn off both the PMOS

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000
and NMOS somehow,
OK, it's not consuming any

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000
power.
And by doing that,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
you can further cut down the
power.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
So, if you can idle some of
your function units,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
it's called idling a function
unit, idle a function unit for,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
let's say, half the time.
OK, you would cut down power by

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
another factor of two.
We can idle,

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000
then, 75% of the time,
come down to 25W.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
So, those are the classes of
tricks that people play.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
I'm going to stop here and
allow the underground guide

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
folks to do the survey.
But, suffice it to say that the

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000
power discussion that I've gone
through with you is a very high

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
level discussion as to the real
thing.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
In real life,
what actually happens is that

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000
there is a fair amount of
standby power even for CMOS

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
logic.
It turns out that although I

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000
don't have a path from VS to
ground for my two transistors,

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000
it turns out that there are
many leakage currents.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000
OK, currents leak through all
kinds of places through the

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
drain of the inverter,
and so on and so forth.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
And so, there is some standby
power.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000
So, let me show you a quick
demo while, I guess,

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
the review handouts are going
around.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
And this shows the temperature
of my CMOS inverter,

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
and as I increase the
frequency, you can just watch

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
the temperature go up,
and hopefully we'll blow this

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
transistor.
So, I'm increasing the

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
frequency as you can see on the
side here, and higher frequency

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
implies more power consumption,
more temperature,

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
OK, and hopefully you will see
some smoke coming out of,

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:42.000
OK, I think I blew the
inverter.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
So, the output is gone.
So, it's at 110 degrees there,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
and that blew it.
Sometimes we see smoke come

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.000
out, but I guess today is not
one of our lucky days.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
OK, so let me stop here and
have the underground guide folks

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000
go through the reviews.

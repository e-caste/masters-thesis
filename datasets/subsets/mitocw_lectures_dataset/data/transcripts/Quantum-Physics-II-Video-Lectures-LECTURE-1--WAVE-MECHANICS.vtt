00:00:21.246 --> 00:00:22.120
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.140
So, we'll get started.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.030
And as I mentioned,
to some degree

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.290
this is going to be review on
the setting of our notation

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.100
and conventions clear.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.735
So, our first topic is
the Schrodinger equation.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.110
So this Schrodinger
equation is an equation

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.340
that takes the following form.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.180
I h bar partial
derivative of this object

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:03.340
called the wave function
that depends on x and t

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:09.000
is equal to minus h squared
over 2m second derivative

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.103
with respect to x plus v
of x and t Psi of x and t.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.910
And that's the full equation.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.430
That's the Schrodinger equation.

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.460
Now actually, this is not
the Schrodinger equation

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:32.060
in most generality, but it's
the Schrodinger equation

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.310
for the case that you
have a potential that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.960
depends on x and t.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.760
For the case that we are doing
non-relativistic physics,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:46.560
because this thing you may
remember is p squared over 2m

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.400
is the kinetic energy operator.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.380
So p squared over 2m
is non-relativistic.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.740
That's a non-relativistic
kinetic energy.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.870
So this is non-relativistic.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.200
Moreover, we have
just one x here.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.460
That means it's a
particle in one dimension.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.800
So we've done a few things,
but this is generally enough

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.530
to illustrate our ideas.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.560
And the most
important thing that

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.190
should be said at
this point is that Psi

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:27.020
of x and t-- which is
the wave function--

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.200
belongs to the complex numbers.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.980
It's a complex number.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.600
And that's by necessity.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.410
If Psi would be real, this
quantity-- the right hand

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.760
side-- would be real.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.340
The potential is a real number.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.125
On the left hand side, on the
other hand, if Psi is real,

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:54.630
its derivative would be real,
and this would be imaginary.

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.620
So, it's just impossible to get
the solution of this equation

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.790
if Psi is real.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.070
So, Psi complex is really
the fundamental thing

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.300
that can be said about
this wave function.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.690
Now, you've used complex
numbers in physics all the time,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.210
and even in electromagnetism,
you use complex numbers.

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.900
But you use them really
in an auxiliary way only.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.060
You didn't use them in an
absolutely necessary way.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.860
So, for example.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:41.630
In E&M, you had an electric
field, for example,

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.620
for a circularly polarized wave.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.000
And you would write it as this.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.410
Let me put the z here.

00:04:00.046 --> 00:04:00.545
Zero.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.190
X hat plus y hat--
those are unit vectors.

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.440
I is a complex number.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.420
It's the square root of minus 1.

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.680
E to the IKZ minus omega t.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.610
You typically wrote
things like that,

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.280
but, in fact, you
always meant real part.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.580
An electric field
is a real quantity.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.740
And the Maxwell's equations
are real equations.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.740
This is a circularly
polarized wave.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.390
And this whole
thing-- by the time

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.280
you take the real part of
this, all these complex numbers

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.300
play absolutely no role.

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.370
It's just a neat way of writing
a complicated electric field

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.160
in which the x component and the
y component are out of phase,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.370
and that you have a wave at
the same time propagating

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.930
in the z direction.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:18.090
So this-- in the
here, E is real,

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:22.780
and all i's are auxiliary.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.840
This is completely
different from the case

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.590
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:36.990
This i there is fundamental.

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.090
The Psi is the
dynamical variable,

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.460
and it has to be complex.

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.910
So, we make a few remarks
about the Schrodinger equation

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:48.610
to get started.

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:56.490
First remark is that this
is first order differential

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.750
equation in time.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.020
This has implications.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.930
Those two derivatives
are maybe--

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.080
for some funny
Hamiltonians, you can

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.070
have even more than two
derivatives or more complicated

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.800
things.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.740
But definitely there's just
one derivative in time.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.887
So, what this means
is that if you

00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:26.960
know the wave function
all over space,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.940
you can calculate
what it's going

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.260
to be a little time later.

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.850
Because if you know
it all over space,

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.770
you can calculate
this right hand side

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.850
and know what is
the time derivative.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:41.500
And with the time
derivative, you

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.240
can figure it out what
it's going to be later.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.720
A first order differential
equation in time

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:51.020
is something that if you know
the quantity at one time,

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.830
the differential
equation tells you

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.830
what it's going to be later.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:59.200
So, that's really sufficient.

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:11.680
Psi of x-- of all x's-- at some
time t naught determines Psi

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:12.720
at all times.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.820
Second property,
fundamental property.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.155
The equation is linear.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.100
So, if you have
two solutions, you

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.430
can form a third by
superimposing them,

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.780
and you can superimpose them
with complex coefficients.

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.110
So, if you have two
solutions, Psi 1 and Psi 2,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:50.480
then a 1 Psi 1 plus A2
Psi 2 is a solution.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.650
And here the a's belong
to the complex numbers.

00:07:54.650 --> 00:08:00.430
So A 1 and A 2 are
complex numbers.

00:08:04.850 --> 00:08:07.300
As far as complex
numbers are concerned,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.550
the first thing you
just need to know

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:13.210
is the definition of the
length of a complex number.

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.720
So, if you have z, a
typical name people

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:21.210
use for a complex number,
having two components.

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:26.225
A plus ib, where
a and b are real.

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:33.049
There's the definition of
the complex conjugate, which

00:08:33.049 --> 00:08:37.049
is a minus ib, and
there's the definition

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.840
of the length of the
complex number, which

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:44.470
is square root of a
squared plus b squared,

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:48.380
which is the square
root of z times z star.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:57.700
So, that's for your
complex number.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:03.790
So, the property that this makes
this into a physical theory

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:06.860
and goes beyond math
is what you know

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.140
is the interpretation of the
wave function as a probability.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.770
So, what do we construct?

00:09:12.770 --> 00:09:20.580
We construct p of x and
t, or sometimes called

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.920
the row of x and t as a density.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:30.330
And it's defined
as Psi star of x t.

00:09:30.330 --> 00:09:35.100
Now, here the notation
means this Psi star--

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.490
we'd put the star
here-- it really

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.600
means Psi of x and
t complex conjugate.

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.590
You complex conjugate
the wave function.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:46.400
And you get that.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.070
We'd put the star here,
and typically don't

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:51.940
put the parentheses, unless
you have to complex conjugate

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:54.040
something that's a
little ambiguous.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:59.960
So, Psi star of x and
t times Psi of x and t.

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.495
And this is called the
probability density.

00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.140
Probability density.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:19.660
And the interpretation is
that if you take p of x and t

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:25.950
and multiply by little dx,
this is the probability

00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:41.770
to find the particle in the
interval x comma x plus dx

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:42.720
at time t.

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.780
So, this is our
probability density.

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:56.600
It's a way to make physics
out of the wave function.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.460
It's a postulate.

00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:02.620
And so the consequence
of this postulate,

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.570
since we're describing
just one particle,

00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:09.920
is that we must have the
particle as somewhere.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:22.136
So, if we add the probabilities
that the particle is somewhere

00:11:22.136 --> 00:11:26.646
all over space, this
is the probability

00:11:26.646 --> 00:11:31.350
that the particle is in
this little dx we integrated

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:34.570
that must be equal to 1.

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:36.925
And this must hold
for all times.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.950
In terms of things
to notice here,

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.650
maybe one thing you can
notice is the units of Psi.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:53.040
The units of Psi must be 1
over square root of length,

00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:55.860
because when we square it,
then we multiply it by length,

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:58.605
we get one, which has no units.

00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:07.090
Key property of the
Schrodinger equation.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:12.200
We will revisit the Schrodinger
equation later and derive it,

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.870
sort of the way [? De ?]
[? Rack ?] derives it in his

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:16.070
textbook.

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:19.970
As just a consequence of
unitary time evolution,

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.020
it would be a very
neat derivation.

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.070
It will give you a
feeling that you really

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.040
understand something deep
about quantum mechanics.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.500
And it will be
true, that feeling.

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.200
But here, we're going to
go the other way around.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:41.470
Just simply ask the
question-- suppose

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:51.280
you have a wave function
such that the integral

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.915
of this quantity at some
specific time is equal to one.

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:07.230
Will this integral be
equal to one for all times,

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:12.020
given that it is one
at some given time?

00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:15.170
Now, you say, well,
why do you ask that?

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:18.890
I ask that because actually
this could be a problem.

00:13:18.890 --> 00:13:22.850
We've said that if you know the
wave function all over space

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:25.210
at one time, it's
determined everywhere.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.140
So any time later.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:31.130
Therefore, if I know the wave
function at time equal zero

00:13:31.130 --> 00:13:35.850
is good-- time equal t zero--
is a good wave function,

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.370
I might warranty that when I
saw the Schrodinger equation,

00:13:39.370 --> 00:13:43.400
the wave function will be
normalized, well, later?

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:44.840
Yes, you are.

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:48.820
And it's a simple or
interesting exercise

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:52.570
that we'll call it
the quick calculation

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.300
that I'll leave
it for you to do.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:14.040
Which is show that d dt of
this integral Psi of x and t

00:14:14.040 --> 00:14:17.900
squared dx is equal to zero.

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:20.400
So, basically what
this is saying.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.680
You got one but, think of
this integral-- I'm sorry,

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.920
I'm missing a dx here-- think
of this integral for all times.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.650
Now it could be a
function of time,

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:36.310
because you put an
arbitrary time here.

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.660
The integral might
depend on time.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.600
So, it's a good question to
think of that integral that

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.730
may be a function of time
and take its derivative.

00:14:45.730 --> 00:14:49.410
If its derivative is
zero for all times,

00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:54.780
and that sometimes equal to
one, it will be one forever.

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:58.880
So, you must show
that this is true.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:03.240
Now, this I think you've done
one way or another several ways

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:05.270
maybe in 804.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.220
But I ask you to do it again.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:11.880
So this is left for you as a
way to warm up on this object.

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:17.260
And you will see actually
that it's a little subtle.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:20.880
It's a little delicate,
because how is it going to go?

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:25.430
You're going to go in and take
the derivative of Psi Psi star.

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.219
You're going to take
the derivative of Psi

00:15:27.219 --> 00:15:29.260
and you're going to use
the Schrodinger equation.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.740
You're going to take the
derivative of Psi star,

00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:34.180
and you're going to use
the complex conjugate

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:36.170
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:15:36.170 --> 00:15:37.720
It's going to be a little messy.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.230
But then you're going to
do integration by parts,

00:15:41.230 --> 00:15:44.010
and you're going to get zero,
but only if you throw away

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:45.650
the terms at infinity.

00:15:45.650 --> 00:15:49.420
And what gives you the
right to throw them away?

00:15:49.420 --> 00:15:50.770
You will have to think.

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.530
And the answer is that
you will throw them away

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:57.360
if the wave function
goes to zero

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:02.640
at infinity, which must do it.

00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.260
The wave function must
go to zero at infinity,

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:07.700
because if it didn't
go to zero at infinity,

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:10.170
it went to a
constant at infinity,

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:15.140
it would pick up an
un-normalizable thing here.

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:19.200
So the wave function definitely
has to go to zero at infinity.

00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:21.870
But that will also
not be quite enough

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:24.600
if you're careful about
what you're doing.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.720
You will have to demand that the
derivative of the wave function

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.550
doesn't blow up.

00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:34.840
It's not asking too much,
but it's asking something.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.620
A function could go
to zero, presumably,

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.770
and its derivative at
the same time blow up,

00:16:40.770 --> 00:16:43.760
but it would be a very
pathological function.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.650
This will bring us to
something that we said.

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.430
We're going to
try to be precise,

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.340
but it's not so
easy to be precise.

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.520
When you try to be
precise, you can

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.040
exaggerate and go
precise to a point

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.210
that you're paralyzed with
fear with every equation.

00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:04.859
We don't want to get that far.

00:17:04.859 --> 00:17:07.750
We want you to notice what
happens and just look at it

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.200
and state what you need.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.770
Why can't we be precise?

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:14.800
Because at the end of
the day, this equation

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.170
is extraordinarily
complicated, and maybe crazy.

00:17:18.170 --> 00:17:20.640
The potential is crazy enough.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.970
So, functions-- mathematicians
can invent crazy functions,

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:29.920
things like a function that is
one for every rational number

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.410
and zero for every
rational number.

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:37.360
Put that for a potential here,
and who knows what one gets.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.530
So, we're going to
take mild functions.

00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:42.400
We're not going to make
them a very complicated,

00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.700
and we're going to be stating
very soon what we need.

00:17:45.700 --> 00:17:47.780
So, what you need
for this to work

00:17:47.780 --> 00:17:49.850
is that the function
goes to zero

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.570
and the relative goes to zero.

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:52.606
Yes.

00:17:52.606 --> 00:17:55.730
AUDIENCE: The potential
has to be real always?

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.070
PROFESSOR: The potential
is real at this moment.

00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:59.250
Yes.

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.550
For the discussion
that we're doing here,

00:18:01.550 --> 00:18:04.688
v is also a real number.

00:18:07.616 --> 00:18:09.292
AUDIENCE: So it
can't be complex?

00:18:09.292 --> 00:18:10.000
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.380
AUDIENCE: Can it be complex?

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.570
PROFESSOR: It could be
in certain applications

00:18:13.570 --> 00:18:15.880
for particles in
electromagnetic fields.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.650
You can have
something that looks

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:19.830
like a complex Hamiltonian.

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:22.890
So we will not discuss that
in this couple of lectures,

00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:25.400
but maybe later.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:25.900
Yes.

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:27.316
AUDIENCE: Are there
any conditions

00:18:27.316 --> 00:18:31.610
that the potential has
to be time-dependent?

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:34.280
PROFESSOR: Well, at this
moment, I put it time dependent.

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:36.820
Also, it complicated
potentials, but they're

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:38.400
sometimes necessary.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.150
And we will discuss
some of them.

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:43.670
We will have very simple
time dependencies.

00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:47.410
Otherwise, it's difficult
to solve this equation.

00:18:47.410 --> 00:18:49.420
But very soon-- in
about five minutes,

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.200
I will say-- let's consider
time-independent things

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.470
to review the things that are a
little more basic and important

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:59.790
and that you should
definitely remember well.

00:18:59.790 --> 00:19:06.000
OK, so that's this part of
the Schrodinger equation.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.560
I want to remind you of
another concept called

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.890
the current--
probability current.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.980
Probability current.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:18.840
What is it?

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:22.420
It's a j of x and
t-- that you will

00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:26.570
review in the homework--
is given by h over m,

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:32.490
the imaginary part of
Psi star d Psi over dx.

00:19:32.490 --> 00:19:34.500
So, it's a real quantity.

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:41.820
And it's called a
probability current.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:47.520
And it goes together with
this probability density,

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:56.480
this probability density
that we wrote over here.

00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:00.260
So it's the current
associated to that density.

00:20:06.870 --> 00:20:09.480
Let's think a second
what this means.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:14.180
In electromagnetism, you have
currents and charged densities.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:19.580
So in E&M, you have a current.

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.790
It's a vector and
a charged density.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.500
Now, this current
could also be a vector.

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:27.870
If you're working in
more than one dimension,

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:29.790
it would be a vector.

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.730
But if you have
electromagnetism,

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.040
the most famous thing associated
to electromagnetism currents

00:20:36.040 --> 00:20:39.800
and charged densities is the
so-called conservation law.

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:47.490
This differential
equations satisfied

00:20:47.490 --> 00:20:49.950
by the current and the density.

00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:54.770
Divergence of j plus d
Rho dt is equal to zero.

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:56.983
That means charge conservation.

00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:01.550
You may or may
not remember that.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:05.410
If you don't, it's a good
time to review it in E&M

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:08.750
and check on that,
discuss it in recitation.

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.960
Think about it.

00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.990
This means charge conservation
as we usually understand,

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:18.610
and the way to do it--
I'm saying just in words--

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.700
is you think of
a volume, you can

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:23.450
see how much charge
is inside, and you

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:26.070
see that the rate of
change of the charge

00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:30.750
is proportional to the current
that is escaping the volume.

00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:34.680
Which is to say, charge is
never destroyed or created.

00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.720
It can escape a volume,
because the charges are moving,

00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.140
but if it doesn't escape, well,
the charge remains the same.

00:21:41.140 --> 00:21:42.920
So, this is charge conservation.

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.150
And this is the same thing.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.720
So the divergence
of j in this case

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:55.740
reduces to dj dx plus
d Rho dt equals zero.

00:22:00.530 --> 00:22:03.250
It has a very similar
interpretation.

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:06.500
So, perhaps in
equations, it's easier

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.290
to think of interpretation.

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:14.250
Consider the real line
and the point a and b,

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:16.550
with a less than b.

00:22:16.550 --> 00:22:21.190
And define the
probability pab of t

00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:31.940
of finding the particle in
this interval between a and b

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:32.675
at any time.

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:42.620
You should be able to
show-- and it's again

00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:44.330
another thing to review.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:45.370
This you can review.

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:50.795
And this review as well.

00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:58.360
You will use this differential
equation, things like that,

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:06.620
to show that dpab dt-- the
rate at which the probability

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:10.300
that you find the particle
in this interval changes

00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.780
depends on what the
current is doing here

00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.820
and what the current
is doing here.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:27.861
So, it's actually given by j of
a and t minus j at b at time t.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:38.740
You can show, and
please try to show it.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:41.210
So, what does that mean?

00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:43.730
You can have the particle
here at any time.

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.900
But if you want to know how
the probability changing,

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:50.010
you must see how
it's leaking from a

00:23:50.010 --> 00:23:51.570
or how it's leaking from b.

00:23:51.570 --> 00:23:54.740
Now j's are defined,
by convention,

00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:56.310
positive to the right.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.620
So, if there's a current--
a bit of current at a,

00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:01.370
it increases the probability.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:05.850
This particle is sort of
moving into the interval.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:09.544
And here at b, there's a
positive current decreases

00:24:09.544 --> 00:24:10.210
the probability.

00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:21.500
Finally, for wave functions,
the last thing we say

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:27.110
is that these wave functions
are-- you want them normalized,

00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:28.900
but we can work with
them and they're

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:32.940
physically equivalent if they
differ just by a constant.

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:44.080
So Psi 1 and Psi 2 are
said to be equivalent

00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:51.610
if Psi 1 of x and t is equal to
some complex constant of Psi 2

00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:52.850
of x and t.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.540
Now, you would say,
well, I don't like that.

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.760
I like normalized
wave functions,

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:05.490
and you could have
a point there.

00:25:05.490 --> 00:25:08.645
But even if these are
normalized functions,

00:25:08.645 --> 00:25:11.110
they could differ by a phase.

00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:13.620
And they would still be
physically equivalent.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:17.940
This part of the definition
of the theory-- the definition

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:21.440
of the theory is that these
wave functions are really

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:25.370
physically equivalent
and indistinguishable.

00:25:25.370 --> 00:25:29.580
And that puts a constraint on
the way we define observables.

00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.380
Any observable should
have this property

00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.900
that, whether we used this
wave function or the other,

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:40.660
they give you the
same observables.

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.700
So, if your wave
functions are normalized,

00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.540
this can be complex
constant of length one.

00:25:48.540 --> 00:25:52.280
Then one normalized implies
the other is normalized.

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.880
If they're not normalized, you
can say, look, the only reason

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:59.610
I'm not normalizing
it because I don't

00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:03.000
gain all that much by
normalizing it, in fact.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.190
I can do almost everything
without normalizing the wave

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:06.720
function.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.680
So, why should I bother?

00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:13.490
And we'll explain that
also as well very soon.

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.890
So, this is something
that this part

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:19.160
of the physical interpretation
that we should keep.

00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:23.200
So, now we've reviewed
the Schrodinger equation.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:27.430
Next thing we want to say is
the most important solutions

00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.590
of the Schrodinger equations
are those energy Eigenstates,

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.110
stationary states.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:37.520
And let's just go
through that subject

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.130
and explain what it was.

00:26:39.130 --> 00:26:42.560
So, I'm going to
start erasing here.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:51.530
So we're going to look at--
whoops-- stationary solutions.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.320
Now, I've used this
week wave function

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:07.250
with a capital
Psi for a purpose,

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.110
because I want to distinguish
it from another Psi

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.700
that we're going to
encounter very soon.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:15.640
So, stationary solutions.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:22.370
And we'll take it-- from now
assume v is time-independent.

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.460
The case is
sufficiently important

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:34.530
that we may as well do it.

00:27:34.530 --> 00:27:38.240
So, in this case, the
Schrodinger equation

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:44.020
is written as I h bar
d Psi dt, and we'll

00:27:44.020 --> 00:27:49.910
write it with something
called an h hat acting on Psi.

00:27:49.910 --> 00:27:53.010
And h hat at this
point is nothing else

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:58.560
than minus h squared over 2m
second derivative with respect

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:01.880
to x plus v of x.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:06.730
We say that h hat is an operator
acting on the wave function

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:10.740
Psi on the right.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:13.200
Operator acting on that--
what does that mean?

00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.440
Basically, when we say an
operator acts on some space,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.530
we mean that it takes
elements of that space

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.790
and moves them
around in the space.

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:29.240
So, you've got a wave function,
which is a complex number that

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:32.190
depends on x and t
ultimately, and then you

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:36.170
act with this thing, which
involves taking derivatives,

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:39.380
multiplying by v
of x, and you still

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.420
got some complex
function of x and t.

00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:47.140
So, this is called the
Hamiltonian operator,

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:49.390
and it's written like that.

00:28:49.390 --> 00:28:51.770
This Hamiltonian operator
is time-independent.

00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:03.190
So, what is a stationary state?

00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:08.970
A stationary state-- the way
it's defined is as follows.

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:28.370
A stationary state of energy
e-- which is a real number--

00:29:28.370 --> 00:29:35.020
is a Psi of x and t
of the following form.

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:36.470
It's a simple form.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:41.910
It's a pure exponential in
time times a function that

00:29:41.910 --> 00:29:44.340
just depends on x.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:46.715
So, it's a pretty simple object.

00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:51.130
So what is it?

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:56.230
We say that this is
a stationary state.

00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:03.250
e to the minus i Et
over H bar Psi of x.

00:30:03.250 --> 00:30:08.560
And this Psi is in purpose
different from this Psi.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.740
It doesn't have the
bar at the bottom,

00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:12.540
and that signals
to you that that's

00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:14.000
the time-independent one.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:20.270
So this also belongs
to the complex numbers,

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.910
but doesn't depend on time.

00:30:23.910 --> 00:30:30.220
So, it's called stationary
because, as it turns out,

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:35.160
when we will compute expectation
values of any observable

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:38.800
on this state, in
this stationary state,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.110
it will be time-independent.

00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:43.240
In particular, you
know, one thing

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:48.070
that observable is the
probability density.

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:53.260
And when you look at that,
you have Psi star and Psi.

00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:58.040
Since E is real,
this phase cancels--

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:00.980
this is really a face,
because E is real.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:05.270
Therefore, Psi star Psi, the
e cancels, and all the time

00:31:05.270 --> 00:31:09.760
dependence cancels
and goes away.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:14.300
Same thing here for the j.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:17.760
The x derivative over here
it doesn't do anything

00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:19.180
to that phase.

00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:24.170
Therefore, the phase e
to the i Et over H bar

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.660
cancels from there two.

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:29.120
And the current also
has no time dependence.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.685
So, this will be the case
for any operator that

00:31:33.685 --> 00:31:37.180
is called a
time-independent operator.

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:41.150
It will have time-independent
expectation values.

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:45.420
So you can ask anything about
some familiar operator-- energy

00:31:45.420 --> 00:31:49.740
operator, momentum operator,
angular momentum operator-- all

00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.170
the famous operators
of quantum mechanics,

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:56.330
and it will have real
expectation values.

00:31:56.330 --> 00:32:02.150
So, as you, you're
supposed to now plug this

00:32:02.150 --> 00:32:04.380
into this equation.

00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.500
And it's a famous result.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:10.370
Let's just do it.

00:32:10.370 --> 00:32:12.400
Plug back into the top equation.

00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.990
So, we have I H bar.

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:18.620
The DET will only
act on the phase,

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:28.080
because the Psi has
no time-dependence.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:31.575
And on the other hand,
on the right hand side,

00:32:31.575 --> 00:32:36.570
the H has nothing
to do with time,

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:40.460
and therefore it can slide
through the exponential

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:43.220
until it hits Psi.

00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:47.590
So here we have H-- well,
I'll put the exponential

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:52.935
in front-- H on little Psi.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:01.630
So, we multiply here,
and what do we get?

00:33:01.630 --> 00:33:03.510
Well, the H bars cancel.

00:33:03.510 --> 00:33:05.910
The i at minus i gives you one.

00:33:05.910 --> 00:33:08.750
You get that E in front.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:13.510
So you get E times
this phase Psi of x.

00:33:13.510 --> 00:33:15.200
And the phase is
supposed to be here,

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:18.250
but I cancel it with
this phase as well.

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:22.125
And I get on the
right hand side H Psi.

00:33:22.125 --> 00:33:26.230
I will put it as
a left hand Psi.

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:29.805
And this is the time-independent
Schrodinger equation.

00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:40.390
So far this is really
a simple matter.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:43.240
We've written a solution
that will represent

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.570
the stationary state,
but then this energy

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:50.340
should be such that you
can solve this equation.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.220
And as you've
learned before, it's

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:55.670
something not so easy
to solve that equation.

00:33:55.670 --> 00:34:03.330
So what do we want to
say about this equation?

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.540
Well, we have a lot to
say, and a few things

00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.679
will be pointed out now
that are very important.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:15.860
So, we have a
differential equation now.

00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:21.150
This differential equation has
second derivatives with respect

00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:21.780
to x.

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:23.940
Now it has no time derivatives.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.929
The time has been factored out.

00:34:26.929 --> 00:34:29.530
Time is not a problem anymore.

00:34:29.530 --> 00:34:32.230
This equation, in
fact, looks quite

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:37.969
real in that it seems that
Psi could even be real here.

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:40.139
And in fact, yes,
there's no problem

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.409
with this Psi being real.

00:34:42.409 --> 00:34:47.730
The total Psi just can't
be real in general.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:51.370
But this one can be
a real, and we'll

00:34:51.370 --> 00:34:54.409
consider those cases as well.

00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:57.480
So, things that
we want to say is

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.180
that this is a second
order differential

00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:01.950
equations in space.

00:35:01.950 --> 00:35:12.470
So second order differential
equation in space.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:13.905
You could write it here.

00:35:13.905 --> 00:35:16.940
The H operator has
partial derivatives,

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:20.540
but this time time,
you might as well

00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:24.680
say that this is minus
h squared over 2m.

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:32.800
The second Psi vx squared
plus v of x tines Psi of x.

00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:36.360
Because Psi only depends
on x, might as well

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.060
write it as complete derivative.

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.080
So, second order
differential equation.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.790
And therefore, the
strategy for this equation

00:35:46.790 --> 00:35:48.970
is a little out there in
relation to the Schrodinger

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:49.470
equation.

00:35:49.470 --> 00:35:51.280
We said, in the
Schrodinger equation,

00:35:51.280 --> 00:35:55.370
we know the wave function
everywhere, you know it later.

00:35:55.370 --> 00:36:00.360
Here, if you know it at one
point-- the wave function--

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:04.060
and you know the derivative
at that one point,

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.240
you have it everywhere.

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.080
Why is that?

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.530
Because that's how you solve
a differential equation.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:12.480
If you know the wave
function and the derivative

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.450
at the point, you go to
the equation and say,

00:36:14.450 --> 00:36:19.100
I know the wave function and
I know the first derivative,

00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:21.150
and I know the
second derivative.

00:36:21.150 --> 00:36:25.330
So, a little later I can know
what the first derivative is,

00:36:25.330 --> 00:36:27.830
and if I know what the first
derivative is a little later,

00:36:27.830 --> 00:36:31.060
I can then know what the wave
function is a little later,

00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.230
and you just integrate
it numerically.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:39.300
So, you just need to know the
wave function Psi of x zero

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:52.000
and Psi prime at x zero
suffice for a solution

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.550
when v is regular.

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:02.580
But this v is not too
complicated, or too strange,

00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.910
because you can always
find exceptions.

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:07.160
You have the square
well potential,

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.770
and you say, oh, I know
the wave function is here

00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.515
and its derivative is zero.

00:37:11.515 --> 00:37:12.890
Does that determine
the solution?

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:15.220
No, because it's infinite.

00:37:15.220 --> 00:37:19.050
There's no space here, really,
and you should work here.

00:37:19.050 --> 00:37:24.460
So, basically, unless v
is really pathological,

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.720
Psi and Psi prime are enough
to solve for everything.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.600
And that actually means
something very important,

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:37.330
that if Psi is equal to zero
at x zero is equal to zero,

00:37:37.330 --> 00:37:41.830
and Psi prime at x zero
is equal to zero, then

00:37:41.830 --> 00:37:46.110
under these regular conditions,
Psi of all x is zero.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:51.115
Because you have a
differential equation which

00:37:51.115 --> 00:37:54.500
the initial value is zero,
the Psi prime is zero.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.650
And you go through
the equation, you

00:37:56.650 --> 00:37:59.800
see that every solution
has to be zero.

00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:02.290
It's the only possibility here.

00:38:02.290 --> 00:38:05.340
So what happens now is the
following-- that you have

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:09.200
a physical understanding
that your wave function,

00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:13.740
when it becomes zero-- it may
do it slowly that it's becoming

00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:18.450
zero, but never quite being
zero-- but if it's zero,

00:38:18.450 --> 00:38:22.420
it does it with Psi prime
different from zero,

00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:26.790
so the wave function
is not zero all over.

00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:31.320
So, this is a pretty important
fact that is useful many times

00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:36.540
when you try to understand
the nature of solutions.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.710
So what else do we have here?

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:42.830
Well, we have energy
Eigenstates on the spectrum.

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:51.840
So, what is an
energy Eigenstate?

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.975
Well, it's a solution
of this equation.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:05.480
So a solution Psi--
a solution for Psi

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:09.260
is an energy Eigenstate.

00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:25.035
Then, this set of values
of E is this spectrum.

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.800
And these two values
of E-- if there's

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.500
a value of E that has
more than one solution,

00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:41.520
we say the spectrum
is degenerate.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:40:05.460
So a degenerate spectrum is
more than one Psi for a given E.

00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:11.340
So, these are just definitions,
but they're used all the time.

00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.200
So, our energy Eigenstates
are the solutions of this.

00:40:15.200 --> 00:40:18.120
The funny thing
about this equation

00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.370
is that sometimes
the requirement

00:40:21.370 --> 00:40:24.540
that Psi be normalized
means that you can't always

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:27.030
find the solution
for any value of E.

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.240
So, only specific
values of Es are

00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.360
allowed-- you know that for
the harmonic oscillator,

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:34.180
for example-- and
therefore there's

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:37.990
something called the spectrum,
which is the allowed values.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:40.010
And many times you
have degeneracies,

00:40:40.010 --> 00:40:42.260
and that makes for very
interesting physics.

00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.980
Let's say a couple more things
about the nature of this wave

00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.760
function.

00:40:54.760 --> 00:41:00.820
So, what kind of
potentials do we allow?

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:08.745
We will allow potentials
that can fail to be bounded.

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.540
What do we allow?

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.710
We allow failure of continuity.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.890
Certainly, we must allow
that in our potentials

00:41:26.890 --> 00:41:28.870
that we consider,
because you have

00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:30.860
even the finite square well.

00:41:30.860 --> 00:41:34.250
The potential is not continuous.

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:37.555
You can allow as well
failure to be bounded.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.100
So, what is a typical example?

00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:50.190
The harmonic oscillator,
the x squared potential.

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:51.150
It's not bounded.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:54.340
It goes to infinity.

00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.680
So, we can fail
to be continuous,

00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:01.210
but we can fail at one
point, another point,

00:42:01.210 --> 00:42:03.770
but we shouldn't fail at
infinitely many points,

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.300
presumably.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:07.280
So, it's piecewise continuous.

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:14.270
It can fail to be bounded, and
it can include delta functions.

00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.540
Which is pretty interesting,
because a lot of physics

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.770
uses delta functions,
but a delta function

00:42:26.770 --> 00:42:28.400
is a complicated thing.

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:32.060
We'll include delta
functions but not

00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:36.410
derivatives of them, nor powers.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:44.330
So we won't take anything more
strange than delta functions,

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:45.895
collections of delta functions.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:54.720
So, this is really how delicate
your potentials will be.

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:57.840
They will not be more
complicated than that.

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:04.260
But for that, we
will assume, and it

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.340
will be completely
consistent to require

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:09.590
the following for
the wave functions.

00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:21.500
So Psi is continuous-- Psi of
x-- is continuous and bounded.

00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:35.580
And its derivative is bounded.

00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.470
Psi prime is bounded.

00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:48.270
AUDIENCE: What about Psi's
behavior at infinity?

00:43:48.270 --> 00:43:49.087
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:43:49.087 --> 00:43:50.712
AUDIENCE: What kind
of extra conditions

00:43:50.712 --> 00:43:54.200
do we have to impose of
Psi's behavior at infinity?

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:59.810
PROFESSOR: Well, I will not
impose any condition that

00:43:59.810 --> 00:44:02.054
is further than that,
except the condition

00:44:02.054 --> 00:44:03.345
that they've been normalizable.

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:10.800
And even that we will
be a little-- how would

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:14.350
I say, not too
demanding on that.

00:44:14.350 --> 00:44:16.040
Because there will
be wave functions,

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:19.190
like momentum Eigenstates
that can't be normalized.

00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:21.250
So, we'll leave it at that.

00:44:21.250 --> 00:44:24.680
I think probably this is
what you should really box,

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.910
because for a
momentum Eigenstate,

00:44:27.910 --> 00:44:31.675
e to the ipx over h bar.

00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:36.360
This is a momentum Eigenstate.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:38.050
This is continuous.

00:44:38.050 --> 00:44:39.090
It's bounded.

00:44:39.090 --> 00:44:40.560
The derivative is bounded.

00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:43.460
It is not normalizable,
but it's so useful

00:44:43.460 --> 00:44:48.470
that we must include in the
list of things that we allow.

00:44:48.470 --> 00:44:51.260
So, bound states
and non-bound states

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.950
are things that are
not normalizable.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:54.540
So, I don't put normalization.

00:44:54.540 --> 00:44:58.420
Now, if you put normalization,
then the wave function

00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:01.280
will go to zero at infinity.

00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.880
And that's all you
would want to impose.

00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:04.660
Nothing else.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:07.440
So, really in some
sense, this is it.

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:09.072
You don't want more than that.

00:45:09.072 --> 00:45:11.030
AUDIENCE: Is normalization
sufficient to ensure

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:13.192
the derivative also goes
to zero at infinity?

00:45:13.192 --> 00:45:13.574
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

00:45:13.574 --> 00:45:15.990
AUDIENCE: Is normalization
sufficient to ensure that the--

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:17.220
PROFESSOR: Not that I know.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:18.190
I don't think so.

00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:19.940
AUDIENCE: Then why is
integration by price

00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.840
generically valid?

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:24.590
PROFESSOR: It's probably
valid for restricted kinds

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:26.470
of potentials.

00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:28.250
So you could not
prove it in general.

00:45:31.150 --> 00:45:33.680
So, you know,
there may be things

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.800
that one can generalize and
be a little more general,

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.860
but I'm trying to
be conservative.

00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.810
I know that for any
decent potential--

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:45.630
and we definitely need
Psi prime bounded.

00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:50.000
And wave functions that
go to zero, the only ones

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.730
I know that also have
Psi prime going to zero.

00:45:52.730 --> 00:45:55.840
But I don't think it's easy
to prove that's generic,

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.000
unless you make
more assumptions.

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:03.510
So, all right.

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:05.810
So, this we'll have
for our wave functions,

00:46:05.810 --> 00:46:09.290
and now I want to say
a couple of things

00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:12.180
about properties
of the Eigenstates.

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.370
Now, we will calculate
many of these Eigenstates,

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.900
but we need to understand
some of the basic properties

00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:20.990
that they have.

00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:25.080
And there's really two
types of identities

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.290
that I want you to be
very aware that they

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:33.370
play some sort of dual role-- a
pretty interesting dual role--

00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:36.420
that has to do with
these wave functions.

00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:44.050
So, the Eigenstates
of-- Eigenstates of H

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:46.440
hat-- these are the
energy Eigenstates.

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:56.440
you can consider them
and make a list of them.

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:02.690
So, you have an energy E zero
less than or equal an E 1, E 2.

00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:03.860
Just goes like that.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.450
And you have a Psi zero, Psi 1.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:09.080
All this wave functions.

00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:15.250
And then H hat Psi N
is equal to E N Psi

00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:18.596
N. You have a set of solutions.

00:47:22.090 --> 00:47:26.595
So, this is what will happen
if you have a good problem.

00:47:26.595 --> 00:47:32.470
A reasonable potential, and
nothing terribly strange

00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:33.550
going on.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:36.100
There would be a
lot of solutions,

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:41.030
and they can be chosen
to be orthonormal.

00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:49.240
Now at first sight, it's a
funny term to use-- orthonormal.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.430
This is a term that
we use for vectors.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:54.930
Two vectors are
orthogonal, and we

00:47:54.930 --> 00:47:58.231
say they're orthonormal if they
have unit length, and things

00:47:58.231 --> 00:47:58.730
like that.

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:05.540
But what do we mean the two
functions are orthonormal?

00:48:05.540 --> 00:48:09.140
Well, our function's vectors.

00:48:09.140 --> 00:48:13.030
Well, that's a little dubious.

00:48:13.030 --> 00:48:16.530
But the way we will think
in quantum mechanics

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:18.820
is that, in some
sense, functions

00:48:18.820 --> 00:48:22.930
are vectors in an infinite
dimensional space.

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:26.080
So, they're just vectors,
but not in three dimensions.

00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:26.980
Why?

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:28.090
Think of it.

00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:31.630
If you have a function,
you have to give values--

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:35.710
independent values-- at many
points-- Infinitely many.

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.150
And if you give
all those values,

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.150
you've got the function.

00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:40.647
If you have a vector, you
have to give components,

00:48:40.647 --> 00:48:41.730
and you've got the vector.

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:44.180
So, in a sense, to
give a function,

00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.810
I have to give a lot of numbers.

00:48:45.810 --> 00:48:48.750
And I can say the
first vector is

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.190
the value along the direction--
the first component is

00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:54.320
the value around zero.

00:48:54.320 --> 00:49:00.430
The second unit vector is the
value of about 0.01, 9.02,

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:01.490
going on and on.

00:49:01.490 --> 00:49:03.240
And then list of
them, and you have

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:06.240
a vector of infinite dimensions.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:09.480
You say, totally
useless. [LAUGHTER] No,

00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.290
it's not totally useless.

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:13.810
Actually, if you
visualize that--

00:49:13.810 --> 00:49:16.440
and we'll do it
later more-- you will

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:21.120
be able to understand many
formulas as natural extensions.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:27.250
So, what does it mean that these
two functions are orthonormal?

00:49:27.250 --> 00:49:31.490
Well, a dot product,
or orthonormality,

00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:33.715
is to say that the
dot product is zero.

00:49:33.715 --> 00:49:41.060
And the way we dot product
functions Psi m and Psi n of x

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:46.690
is we take their values at
the same point with star one,

00:49:46.690 --> 00:49:47.455
and we integrate.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.830
And, if this is
equal to delta mn,

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:57.915
we say the functions
are orthonormal.

00:50:05.810 --> 00:50:09.720
So, ortho, for
orthogonal, which says

00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:13.420
that if m is different from
n, the Kronecker delta,

00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:16.505
that symbol is equal to
one if the two labels

00:50:16.505 --> 00:50:19.560
are the same, or zero otherwise.

00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:21.580
If they're different,
you get zero.

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.620
The inner product--
this left hand

00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:26.150
side is called the
inner product-- is zero.

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:31.090
On the other hand, if they are
the same, if m is equal to n,

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:33.650
it says that the
Psi squared is one.

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:36.420
Kind of like a wave function
that is well normalized.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.560
So we say normal
for orthonormal.

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:44.220
So these are orthonormal wave
functions, and that's good.

00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.540
This is called orthonormality.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:50.010
But then there is a
more subtle property,

00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:53.650
which is that this
set of functions

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:58.770
is enough to expand any
function in this interval

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:00.560
that you're doing your
quantum mechanics.

00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:03.245
So, if you have any
reasonable function,

00:51:03.245 --> 00:51:08.750
it can be written as a
superposition of these ones.

00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:12.320
So, this differential
equation furnishes for you

00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.280
a collection of functions
that are very useful.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:17.080
So this is orthonormality.

00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:20.550
This is also
completeness, which is

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:26.780
to say that any
function can be written

00:51:26.780 --> 00:51:29.780
as a sum of of this function.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.280
So I will write it as this.

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:34.740
Psi of x-- an
arbitrary Psi of x--

00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:39.630
can be written as
bm Psi n of x n

00:51:39.630 --> 00:51:43.945
equals zero to infinity,
where the bn's are complex.

00:51:50.950 --> 00:51:56.980
So, this is an assumption, but
it's a very solid assumption.

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:59.900
When you study differential
equations of this type--

00:51:59.900 --> 00:52:01.790
Sturm-Liouville
problem-- this is

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:04.680
one thing that
mathematicians prove for you,

00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:06.700
and it's not all that easy.

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.570
But the collection
of wave functions

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:10.140
is good in this sense.

00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:13.690
It provides you a
complete set of things

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:17.080
that any function can be
written in terms of that.

00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:21.812
I'm not saying this satisfies
any particular equation.

00:52:21.812 --> 00:52:26.050
You see, this function satisfies
very particular equations--

00:52:26.050 --> 00:52:29.900
those equations-- but this
is an arbitrary function.

00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:32.470
And it can be written
as a sum of this.

00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:35.570
See, these equations
have different energies

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:37.760
for different Psi's.

00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:42.380
This Psi here satisfies
no obvious equation.

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:47.790
But here is a problem
that this is useful for.

00:52:47.790 --> 00:52:54.840
Suppose you're given a wave
function at, at the given time,

00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:57.290
you know what it looks like.

00:52:57.290 --> 00:53:00.865
So, here is your wave function.

00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:06.600
Psi.

00:53:06.600 --> 00:53:10.520
And you know that
Psi at x and time

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:15.430
equals to zero happens to
be equal to this Psi of x

00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:16.590
that we wrote above.

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:20.707
So, it's equal to bn Psi n of x.

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:33.910
Well, if you know that, if you
can calculate this coefficient,

00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:36.610
the wave function of time
equals zero is known,

00:53:36.610 --> 00:53:39.470
say, and it was given
by this thing, which

00:53:39.470 --> 00:53:41.780
is then written in this form.

00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.420
If you can write
it in this form,

00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.630
you've solved the problem
of time evolution,

00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:53.190
because then Psi
of x at any time

00:53:53.190 --> 00:54:00.440
is just simply obtained by
evolving each component.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:10.910
Which is bn e to the minus
iEnt over h bar Psi n of x.

00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:12.530
So this is the important result.

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:20.720
Now, look what has happened.

00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.570
We have replaced each term.

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:25.420
We added this exponential.

00:54:25.420 --> 00:54:26.900
Why?

00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:31.240
Because then each one
of these is a solution

00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:34.880
of the full
Schrodinger equation.

00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:38.170
And therefore a superposition
with complex coefficients

00:54:38.170 --> 00:54:41.660
is still a solution of
the Schrodinger equation.

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:44.280
Therefore, this thing
I've put by hand

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:46.580
is, you would say it's ad hoc.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:48.440
No, it's not.

00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.030
We've put it by
hand, yes, but we've

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:54.000
produced a solution of the
Schrodinger equation, which

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.740
has another virtue.

00:54:55.740 --> 00:54:59.040
When t is equal to
zero, it becomes

00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.490
what you know the
wave function is.

00:55:01.490 --> 00:55:04.340
So, since this solves the
Schrodinger equation--

00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:06.810
time equals zero gives
you the right answer.

00:55:06.810 --> 00:55:08.890
And you remember that
the Schrodinger equation,

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:10.830
if you know that
time equals zero,

00:55:10.830 --> 00:55:12.970
the term is a wave
function everywhere--

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:15.100
this is the solution.

00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.860
It's not just a solution.

00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:19.780
It's the solution.

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:23.250
So, you've solved this equation,
and it's a very nice thing.

00:55:23.250 --> 00:55:25.360
It all depends, of
course, on having

00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:27.660
found the coefficients bn.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:29.930
Because typically
at time equals zero,

00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:32.560
you may know what
the wave function is,

00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:34.440
but you may not
know how to write it

00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:37.780
in terms of these
coefficients bn.

00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:39.610
So, what do you do then?

00:55:39.610 --> 00:55:41.770
If you don't know
those coefficients,

00:55:41.770 --> 00:55:43.650
you can calculate them.

00:55:43.650 --> 00:55:46.550
How do you calculate them?

00:55:46.550 --> 00:55:50.250
Well, you use orthonormality.

00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:57.120
So you actually take this and
integrate against another Psi

00:55:57.120 --> 00:55:58.550
star.

00:55:58.550 --> 00:56:02.640
So you take a Psi star
sub m and integrate--

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.340
multiply and integrate.

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:08.860
And then the right hand side
will get the Kronecker delta

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.760
that will pick out one term.

00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:14.830
So, I'm just saying in
words a two line calculation

00:56:14.830 --> 00:56:19.940
that you should do if you
don't see this as obvious.

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:22.330
Because it's a
kind of calculation

00:56:22.330 --> 00:56:23.920
that you do a few times in life.

00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:28.360
Then it becomes obvious
and you never do it again.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:38.710
It's minus infinity to infinity
dx Psi m star of x Psi of x dx.

00:56:38.710 --> 00:56:42.250
So, bm is given
by this quantity,

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:45.360
or bn is given by this quantity.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:50.440
You obtain it from here
plus orthonormality.

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.510
So, once you have
this bn, you can

00:56:52.510 --> 00:56:57.210
do something that may-- if
you look at these things

00:56:57.210 --> 00:57:00.940
and say, well, I'm
bored, what should I do?

00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.070
I say, well, you have bm.

00:57:02.070 --> 00:57:03.380
Plug it back.

00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:06.740
What happens then?

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:09.120
You say, why would
I plug it back?

00:57:09.120 --> 00:57:10.800
I don't need to plug it back.

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:16.020
And that's true, but it's
not a crazy thing to do,

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:20.540
because it somehow must
lead to some identity.

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:23.380
Because you solve an equation
and then plug it back

00:57:23.380 --> 00:57:29.710
and try to see if
somehow it makes sense.

00:57:29.710 --> 00:57:33.120
So either it makes sense, or
you learned something new.

00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:37.580
So, we were supposed
to calculate the bn's.

00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:41.350
And now we have them, so
I can plug this back here.

00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:48.780
So what do I Get Psi of x now is
equal to the sum from n equals

00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.020
zero to infinity.

00:57:51.020 --> 00:57:58.815
bn-- but this bn is the integral
of Psi n star of x prime.

00:57:58.815 --> 00:58:01.500
I put here Psi of x prime.

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.240
dx prime.

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.840
I don't want to confuse
the x's with x prime,

00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:10.460
so I should put the x
primes all over here.

00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:12.580
Psi n of x.

00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:17.540
Well, can I do the integral?

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:19.290
No.

00:58:19.290 --> 00:58:24.060
So, have I gained anything?

00:58:24.060 --> 00:58:27.760
Well, you've gained something
if you write it in a way

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:35.910
that Psi is equal to
something times Psi.

00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:37.790
That doesn't look
all that simple,

00:58:37.790 --> 00:58:41.750
but we can at least organize it.

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:46.170
Let's assume things
are convergent enough

00:58:46.170 --> 00:58:48.860
that you can change orders
of sums and integrals.

00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:52.840
That's an assumption
we always do.

00:58:52.840 --> 00:58:53.890
I'll write it like this.

00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:54.920
dx prime.

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:59.570
And now I'll put the
sum here equals zero

00:58:59.570 --> 00:59:06.170
to infinity of Psi
n star of x prime.

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:08.830
And I'll put the other
Psi here as well.

00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:13.390
The Psi n of x over here.

00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:18.400
I'll put the parentheses, and
finally the Psi of x prime

00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:18.900
here.

00:59:23.530 --> 00:59:27.030
So, now it's put in a nice way.

00:59:27.030 --> 00:59:28.840
And it's a nice way
because it allows

00:59:28.840 --> 00:59:33.070
you to learn something new
and interesting about this.

00:59:33.070 --> 00:59:35.460
And what is that?

00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:40.790
That this must be a
very peculiar function,

00:59:40.790 --> 00:59:45.670
such that integrated
against Psi gives you Psi.

00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:48.540
And what could it be?

00:59:48.540 --> 00:59:51.210
Well, this is of
the form, if you

00:59:51.210 --> 00:59:54.770
wish-- the x prime--
some function

00:59:54.770 --> 01:00:00.670
of x and x prime--
times Psi of x prime.

01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:02.850
So, this k is this thing.

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:12.340
Well, you can try to
think what this is.

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:14.230
If you put the delta
function here--

01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:16.020
which may be a little
bit of a cheat--

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.540
you will figure out
the right answer.

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:23.200
This must be a function
that sort of picks out

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.710
the value of the function
at x by integrating.

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:29.800
So it only cares
about the value at x.

01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:32.290
So, it must be a delta function.

01:00:32.290 --> 01:00:38.280
So, in fact, this
is a delta function,

01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:41.080
or should be a delta function.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:46.050
And therefore the
claim is that we now

01:00:46.050 --> 01:00:52.070
have a very curious identity
that looks as follows.

01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:57.750
It looks like n equal zero
to infinity, Psi n star

01:00:57.750 --> 01:01:03.460
of x prime Psi n
of x is actually

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:06.385
delta of x minus x prime.

01:01:10.170 --> 01:01:11.850
So, this must be true.

01:01:11.850 --> 01:01:15.560
If what we said at
the beginning is true,

01:01:15.560 --> 01:01:21.660
that you can expand any function
in terms of the Eigenfunctions,

01:01:21.660 --> 01:01:25.630
then, well, that's not
such a trivial assumption.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:30.370
And therefore, it allows you
to prove something fairly

01:01:30.370 --> 01:01:34.050
surprising, that
this must be true,

01:01:34.050 --> 01:01:36.750
that this identity must be true.

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:41.880
And I want you to realize
and compare and contrast

01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.450
with this identity here.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.400
One is completeness.

01:01:47.400 --> 01:01:48.333
One is orthonormality.

01:01:51.530 --> 01:01:55.490
There are two kinds
of sums going on here.

01:01:55.490 --> 01:02:05.250
Here is sum over space, and
you keep labels arbitrary--

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:07.810
label indices arbitrary.

01:02:07.810 --> 01:02:09.430
So, sum over space.

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:13.660
These functions depend
on space and on labels.

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.140
Sum over space, and
keep the labels,

01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:20.710
and you get sort of a
unit matrix in this space,

01:02:20.710 --> 01:02:22.930
in the space of labels.

01:02:22.930 --> 01:02:30.540
Here, you keep the positions
arbitrary, but sum over labels.

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:33.030
And now you get
like a unit matrix

01:02:33.030 --> 01:02:35.530
in the space of positions.

01:02:35.530 --> 01:02:38.450
Something is one--
but actually infinite,

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:42.640
but you couldn't do better--
when x is equal to x prime.

01:02:42.640 --> 01:02:44.580
So, if you think
of it as a matrix,

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:49.310
this function in x and x prime
is a very strange matrix,

01:02:49.310 --> 01:02:52.410
with two indices, x and x prime.

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:55.050
And when x is different
from x prime, it's zero,

01:02:55.050 --> 01:02:57.250
but when x is equal
to x prime, it's one.

01:02:57.250 --> 01:02:59.510
But it has to be
a delta function,

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:01.820
because continuous variables.

01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:03.480
But it's the same idea.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:08.090
So, actually if you think
of these two things, x and m

01:03:08.090 --> 01:03:15.010
as dual variables, this
is a matrix variable,

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:19.700
and then you're sort of
keeping these two indices open

01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.660
and summing over
the other index.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:24.500
Multiplying in one way
you get a unit matrix.

01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:27.340
Here, you do the
other way around.

01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:30.250
You have a matrix in m and n.

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:32.680
This is a more familiar
matrix, but then you

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:35.100
sum over the other things.

01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:38.780
So, they're dual,
and two properties

01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:44.840
that look very different in the
way you express them in words.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:47.380
One is that they're orthonormal.

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:49.350
The other is that
they're complete.

01:03:49.350 --> 01:03:51.280
And then suddenly
then the mathematics

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:56.370
tells you there's a nice
duality between them.

01:03:56.370 --> 01:04:00.350
So, the last thing
I want to say today

01:04:00.350 --> 01:04:03.830
is about expectation
values, which

01:04:03.830 --> 01:04:11.150
is another concept we
have to review and recall.

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:14.300
So let's give those ideas.

01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:22.265
So, if we have a
time-dependent operator-- no,

01:04:22.265 --> 01:04:25.350
a time independent-- we'll do
a time-independent operator,

01:04:25.350 --> 01:04:26.175
I'm sorry.

01:04:26.175 --> 01:04:31.280
Time-Independent operator.

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:40.500
And this operator
will be called A hat.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:43.650
No time dependence
on the operator.

01:04:43.650 --> 01:04:48.960
So, then we have the
expectation value

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.040
of this operator on
a normalized state.

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.590
So what does that mean?

01:04:53.590 --> 01:05:01.330
The expectation value of this
operator on a state-- on a wave

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.100
function here.

01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:05.880
Now, this wave function
is time-dependent.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.880
So this expectation
value of this operator

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:14.830
is expected to be
a function of time.

01:05:14.830 --> 01:05:17.180
And how is it defined?

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:20.610
It's defined by doing
the following integral.

01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:23.870
Again, from minus
infinity to infinity,

01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:31.220
dx Psi star of x and t,
and then the operator

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:34.780
A acting on Psi of x and t.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:44.240
And Psi is supposed to
be a normalized state.

01:05:53.780 --> 01:05:57.920
So, notice the notation here.

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.540
We put the Psi here because
of the expectation-- whenever

01:06:01.540 --> 01:06:03.000
somebody asks you
the expectation

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.120
value for an operator, it
has to be on a given state.

01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:08.500
So you put the state.

01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:12.050
Then you realize that this is
a time-dependent wave function

01:06:12.050 --> 01:06:15.400
typically, so it
could depend on time.

01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:18.030
Now, we said about
stationary states

01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:20.520
that if the state is
stationary, there's

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.840
a single time exponential here.

01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:28.430
There's just one term, e to
the minus iEt over h bar.

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:32.270
And if A, of course, is a
time-independent operator,

01:06:32.270 --> 01:06:34.150
you won't care about
the exponential.

01:06:34.150 --> 01:06:36.600
You will cancel this
one, and there will not

01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:39.110
be a time dependence there.

01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:42.360
But if this state
is not stationary--

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.540
like most states
are not stationary--

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.400
remember it's very important.

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:50.160
If you have a stationary
state, and you superimpose

01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:54.280
another stationary state,
the result is not stationary.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:56.540
Stationary is a
single exponential.

01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:59.330
More than one exponential
is not stationary.

01:06:59.330 --> 01:07:03.260
So when you have this, you
could have time dependence.

01:07:03.260 --> 01:07:05.020
So that's why we wrote it.

01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.890
Whenever you have a state
that is not stationary,

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:11.150
there is time dependence.

01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:15.290
Now, you could do
the following thing.

01:07:15.290 --> 01:07:21.940
So here is a simple but
important calculation

01:07:21.940 --> 01:07:24.580
that should be done.

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:28.930
And it's the expectation
value of H. So

01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:34.170
what is the expectation value
of the Hamiltonian at time

01:07:34.170 --> 01:07:40.300
t on this wave function Psi
that we've computed there?

01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:43.290
So, we would have to
do that whole integral.

01:07:43.290 --> 01:07:50.070
And in fact, I ask
you that you do it.

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:51.870
It's not too hard.

01:07:51.870 --> 01:07:56.350
In fact, I will say
it's relatively simple.

01:07:56.350 --> 01:08:02.360
And you have H on
Psi of x and t,

01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.540
and then you must substitute
this Psi equal the sum of bn

01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:07.525
Psi n.

01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:13.250
And you have two sums.

01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:17.189
And the H acting on each
side n-- you know what it is.

01:08:17.189 --> 01:08:20.229
And then the two sums-- you
can do the integral using

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:22.229
orthonormality.

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:27.109
It's a relatively
standard calculation.

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:28.890
You should be able to do it.

01:08:28.890 --> 01:08:31.560
If you find it hard, you
will see it, of course,

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:32.819
in the notes.

01:08:32.819 --> 01:08:36.020
But it's the kind of thing
that I want you to review.

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:38.960
So, what is the answer here?

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.500
It's a famous answer.

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:47.229
It's bm squared En.

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:52.490
So, you get the expected
value of the energy.

01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:57.350
It's a weighted average over all
of the stationary states that

01:08:57.350 --> 01:09:00.069
are involved in this state
that you've been building.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:04.140
So your state has a little
bit of Psi zero, Psi 1, Psi 2,

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.040
Psi 3.

01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.270
And for each one, you square its
component and multiply by En.

01:09:10.270 --> 01:09:13.490
And this is time-independent.

01:09:13.490 --> 01:09:16.010
And you say, well,
you told me that only

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:19.260
for stationary states,
things are time-independent.

01:09:19.260 --> 01:09:23.300
Yes, only for stationary
states, all operators

01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:25.300
are time-independent,
but the Hamiltonian

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.029
is a very special operator.

01:09:28.029 --> 01:09:30.420
It's an energy
operator, and this

01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:32.330
is a time independent system.

01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.729
It's not being
driven by something,

01:09:34.729 --> 01:09:37.910
so you would expect the
energy to be conserved.

01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:40.540
And this is pretty
much the statement

01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:44.630
of conservation of energy,
the time-independence

01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:46.520
of this thing.

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:51.120
My last remark is technical
about normalizations,

01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:56.100
and it's something
you may find useful.

01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:03.390
If you have a wave function
that is Psi, which is not

01:10:03.390 --> 01:10:11.640
normalized, you may say,
OK, let's normalize it.

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:14.920
So, what is the
normalized wave function?

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.130
The normalized wave
function is Psi

01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:25.340
divided by the square root of
the integral of Psi star Psi

01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:25.840
dx.

01:10:29.820 --> 01:10:33.920
You see, this is a number, and
you take the square root of it.

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.640
And this is the Psi of x and t.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:42.945
If the Psi is not normalized,
this thing is normalized.

01:10:47.410 --> 01:10:52.240
So, think of doing this here.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:56.530
Suppose you don't
want to work too hard,

01:10:56.530 --> 01:11:00.550
and you want to normalize
your wave function.

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:03.130
So, your Psi is not normalized.

01:11:03.130 --> 01:11:06.730
Well, then this is
definitely normalized.

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:07.840
You should check that.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:10.130
Square it, an integrate
it, and you'll see.

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:11.560
You'll get one.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:17.200
But then I can then calculate
the expectation value of A

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.700
on that state,
and wherever I see

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:25.120
a Psi that should be normalized,
I put this whole thing.

01:11:25.120 --> 01:11:26.870
So what do I end up with?

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:29.620
I end up with this
integral from infinity

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:41.270
to infinity dx Psi star A A
hat Psi divided by the integral

01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:49.680
from minus infinity to
infinity of Psi star Psi dx.

01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:53.460
If you don't want to normalize
a wave function, that's OK.

01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:57.590
You can still calculate
its expectation value

01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:01.250
by working with a
not-normalized wave function.

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:08.180
So in this definition,
Psi is not normalized,

01:12:08.180 --> 01:12:11.690
but you still get
the right value.

01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:13.850
OK, so that's it for today.

01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:18.910
Next time we'll do properties
of the spectrum in one dimension

01:12:18.910 --> 01:12:23.340
and begin something new called
the variational problem.

01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:23.940
All right.

01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:24.840
[APPLAUSE]

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.990
Thank you, thank you.

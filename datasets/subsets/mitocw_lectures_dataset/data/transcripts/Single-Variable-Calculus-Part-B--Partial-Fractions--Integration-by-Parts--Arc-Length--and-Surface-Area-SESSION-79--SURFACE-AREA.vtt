00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:07.370
Hi.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.100
Welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.550
In class, one of the things
you've talked about recently

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.640
was computing surface areas
of solids of rotation.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.140
So I have a nice problem
relating to that here.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.880
So the circle with center
(R, 0) and radius little r--

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.400
so this is center big
R, 0, and radius little

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.660
r, which is less than big R--
is rotated around the y-axis.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.630
And the question is,
what's the surface

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.180
area of the resulting solid?

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.140
So we have here the circle.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.660
Its center is at
the point big R, 0,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.810
and its radius is
little r, so this

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:42.980
is the equation of that circle.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.435
And we're going to rotate
this circle around this axis.

00:00:45.435 --> 00:00:46.810
So we're going to
spin it around.

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:48.820
And what you're going
to get is a donut,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.900
or what mathematicians
call a torus.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.970
So here's a little
schematic of it

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.400
here, with one dotted little
cross section corresponding

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.540
to this circle.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.320
So the question is, what is
the surface area of this torus?

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.410
So why don't you
pause the video,

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.069
take a few minutes to work
this problem out yourself,

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:08.860
come back, and we can
work it out together.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.970
So when we solved surface
area problems in class,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.000
we took the curve that
we were going to rotate,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.830
and we cut it into lots of
little pieces with length ds.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.860
So let me draw that, just
very quickly, up here.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.270
So we had, you took
whatever your curve was,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.080
and you cut it into lots
of these little segments.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.090
And then for each segment,
you rotated it around an axis.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.200
And so if the segment has
this little length ds,

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.610
a little piece of arc
length-- so in our case,

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.370
we're going to rotate it around
the y-axis, so the length,

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:57.630
the area that this thing
traces out as it spins around,

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.550
is going to be this
little piece of area, dA,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.620
which is equal to 2*pi*x*ds.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.760
Now, this is a
little bit different

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.110
than most of the examples
Professor Jerison

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.900
did in class, because here we're
rotating around the y-axis, not

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.000
around the x-axis.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.390
So if you rotated
around the x-axis,

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.410
what you would get is 2*pi*y*ds.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.850
And here we get 2*pi*x*dx.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.510
The idea of the x and the
y in this formula, this x,

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.320
it's just telling
you what the radius

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.780
is between your little segment
and the axis around which

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.020
you're rotating it.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.380
So here this is, you know,
2*pi*x is the circumference

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.340
of this circle that it traces
out, and ds is its length,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.050
because it's giving you a
little ribbon as it goes around.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.740
So we have this formula,
dA equals 2*pi*x*ds.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.760
And so in order to get the
surface area, what we do,

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.070
is we have to integrate this
over an appropriate region.

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.250
So in order to do
that, we first need,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.510
you know, all the variables in
the integrand to be the same,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.190
so we need to write everything
in terms of x, or everything

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.040
in terms of y, or everything
in terms of some variable

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.010
that we can integrate against.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.310
So in our particular
case with this torus,

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.630
I think we can take
advantage of a little bit

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.890
of symmetry here, which
is that this, you know,

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:27.280
torus is top-bottom
symmetric, right?

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.580
As the top half of the
circle goes around,

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.035
it traces out one surface.

00:03:32.035 --> 00:03:34.370
As the bottom half of
the circle goes around,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.767
it traces out another surface.

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:37.850
But those two surfaces
have exactly the same area.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.558
They're just mirror
images of each other,

00:03:39.558 --> 00:03:42.060
because the circle is symmetric.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.540
So we can just
consider the problem

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.230
of spinning the top half
of the circle around.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.350
And so for the top
half of the circle,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:54.020
we can write down
an equation for y

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.030
in terms of x, and so then
we can integrate-- you know,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.950
that sets up a nice
integral with respect to x.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.490
So in order to do this, well
we're going to need two things.

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.980
So we're going to need
to know what ds is.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.740
And so you had a couple
of different formulas

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.240
for this in class.

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.520
So you had ds-- so one
easy mnemonic that I

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.310
like is to write ds equals
the square root of dx squared

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.040
plus dy squared.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.600
So for me, this always--
I can remember this,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.750
because it's just the
Pythagorean theorem, right?

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.900
So you have a little
dx horizontal distance,

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.150
and a little dy
vertical distance,

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.490
and so the ds is just a
hypotenuse of that triangle.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.740
So that's how I remember this.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.940
And so then you also have
the equivalent formula

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.580
if you factor out
a dx from here.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.000
You know, divide through by
dx and multiply outside by dx.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:57.950
You can write this as the
square root of 1 plus dy by dx

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:03.160
squared times, outside
the square root, dx.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.300
So this is our little piece ds.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.440
And OK, we have an x
in the formula already.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:14.970
So ds-- so we now have
ds with a dx here.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.160
So the only thing
we have left, is

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.660
we need to figure out
what dy/dx is in order

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.010
to put all this into the
formula, in order to integrate.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.510
So OK.

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.817
So dy/dx.

00:05:25.817 --> 00:05:27.650
So OK, so that means I
need y in terms of x.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:28.230
Now let-- OK.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.950
So if we're focusing only on
the top half of this torus, that

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.470
means y-- well, we can
solve this equation for y,

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:38.970
but when we take
the square root,

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:42.080
we're only taking the positive
square root, because we're only

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.900
looking at the top
half of the torus,

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.030
and then we'll just
double at the end

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.290
to account for the
bottom half as well.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.980
So this is y equals
the square root

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.990
of-- so you solve,
you subtract x minus r

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:58.370
squared from both sides.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.710
So this is little r squared
minus x minus big R squared.

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.290
So that's y.

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:13.830
And now you can differentiate
to get dy by dx.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.330
All right.

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.100
So now we have to do
our chain rule right.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.210
So we've got a 1/2 power.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.300
So this is 1/2
times-- well, it's

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.220
going to be the inside
to the minus 1/2.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:31.830
So this is over the
square root of r squared

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.990
minus x minus R quantity
squared, and now I

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:39.950
need to multiply by the
derivative of the inside, which

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:45.310
is minus 2 times x minus R. OK.

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:48.110
And the 2's cancel
out a little bit,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:55.750
so we can rewrite this as
minus x minus R divided

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:59.080
by the square root
of little r squared

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.170
minus x minus R squared.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.470
OK.

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.760
So that's dy/dx.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.490
The square root--
that's a little ugly,

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:11.940
but it's OK, because we're
about to square it out again.

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:12.780
So all right.

00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:13.750
So we've got dy/dx.

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.750
So now we go back,
now we can compute ds,

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:19.250
and then with ds, we can
go even further back,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.570
and we can compute dA.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:22.760
And once we've got
dA, to get a, we just

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.907
integrate dA over the
appropriate bounds.

00:07:25.907 --> 00:07:27.990
So-- which we haven't
figured out yet, by the way.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:30.324
We will have to talk
about that at the very,

00:07:30.324 --> 00:07:33.390
you know, in a minute.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.890
OK.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:36.650
So we take this,
so we have dy/dx.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:40.870
So from dy/dx, we
get ds is equal

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.740
to-- it's the square root of,
well, let's use this formula.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:49.150
It's the square root of 1
plus, now, dy/dx squared.

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:49.650
OK.

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:51.024
So I put this in
and I square it.

00:07:51.024 --> 00:07:56.820
So I get x minus
R squared on top.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:59.750
You know, you square the
minus sign, gives you 1.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.250
And on the bottom, we
square the square root,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:15.660
so we get little r squared
minus x minus R squared, OK, dx.

00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.230
Great.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:16.730
Good.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:18.730
So now we add these two
things together, right?

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:20.840
I mean, well we
want to-- I should

00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.050
say-- we want to simplify
this to a usable form.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.470
And so to put it
in a usable form,

00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:26.844
well we're going
to manipulate it

00:08:26.844 --> 00:08:29.630
until it looks nice, or as
nice as we could hope for.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.660
And in this case, right.

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.700
So we can, there's an
obvious simplification,

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.530
or simplifying step,
which is we can

00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.990
add this 1 into the fraction.

00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.820
OK.

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.640
And so this is little r
squared minus x minus big R

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.500
squared, over little r squared
minus x minus big R squared,

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:48.050
and so when you add it
to x minus big R squared

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:52.220
over little r squared minus
x minus big R squared,

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.300
this part cancels.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.900
And so you're left with-- OK.

00:08:55.900 --> 00:08:59.430
And now I'm just going to pass
the square root through right

00:08:59.430 --> 00:09:05.320
away, so this is little r over
the square root of little r

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:13.940
squared minus x minus
big R squared dx.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:14.440
OK.

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:16.023
So just a little bit
of algebra there.

00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:18.130
So this is ds.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:21.180
Now, OK, so now we're going--
we want to compute surface area,

00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.730
so we need dA, and dA
is 2*pi*x times ds.

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:27.530
So-- OK.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:31.080
So that's easy to write
down now that I've got ds.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:46.300
So this is dA equal to 2*pi*r*x
over r squared minus x minus

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:52.730
big R squared, square
root of that, dx.

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.230
All right.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:54.850
This is dA.

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:56.950
You know, we haven't done
any calculus, actually.

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.741
Oh, I guess we took a
derivative somewhere.

00:09:58.741 --> 00:10:01.460
We haven't done any
integration yet.

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.072
Now, to compute the surface
area, we just integrate this.

00:10:05.072 --> 00:10:10.350
So we get to, you know, the
calculus step of this problem.

00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.140
So integrate this.

00:10:12.140 --> 00:10:14.670
But of course, you know,
I'm expecting a number out

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:15.170
at the end.

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:17.020
I'm taking a definite integral.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.650
So I need bounds.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:21.190
Well, what bounds do I need?

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:23.580
Well, I'm integrating
with respect to x.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:28.310
So I need to integrate over
the relevant values of x.

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:29.972
What are the
relevant values of x?

00:10:29.972 --> 00:10:31.680
Well, come back to
our picture over here.

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.310
We have this circle.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.840
Its center is at x
equals R, y equals 0.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.280
And it has radius little r.

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.470
So, you know, the
relevant values of x

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:47.930
are just from the leftmost
point of the circle

00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:49.770
to the rightmost
point of the circle.

00:10:49.770 --> 00:10:51.640
And so this leftmost
point is just-- well,

00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:53.460
the radius is
little r, so this is

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.280
big R minus-- x equals
big R minus little r,

00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.520
and the rightmost point is x
equals big R plus little r.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:07.130
So the bounds-- so I'm going
to go up here-- so I have area

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:09.645
is what I get when
I integrate dA.

00:11:09.645 --> 00:11:14.720
And I want to integrate it from
x equals big R minus little

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:19.320
r to big R plus little
r, and dA is this thing

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.840
I found, just a moment ago.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.660
So this is-- well, OK.

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:27.970
So 2*pi little r is a constant.

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.350
I'm just going to factor
that out in front.

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:39.890
So this is 2*pi little r times
x over the square root of little

00:11:39.890 --> 00:11:51.130
r squared minus big R minus--
sorry-- x minus big R squared.

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.500
That's all under
the square root.

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.791
ds.

00:11:55.791 --> 00:11:56.290
OK.

00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.840
So now we have to figure out
how to integrate this thing.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.510
Right?

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.730
So this is a little ugly.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:05.970
It's not horrible, though.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:06.470
Right?

00:12:06.470 --> 00:12:08.550
So down here we have
something that's

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:13.270
really reminiscent of one of
these trig integral things

00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:13.790
we've done.

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:14.290
Right?

00:12:14.290 --> 00:12:16.400
We've got a square root
of a something squared

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.280
minus a something else squared.

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:21.510
So that, reminds, you
know, what does that

00:12:21.510 --> 00:12:23.740
remind, maybe some
sine substitution.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:24.950
Something like that.

00:12:24.950 --> 00:12:27.300
There's some there's some
trig substitution waiting

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.240
to happen here.

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:30.960
But, so OK.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:36.040
We could sort of shoot to do
it all in one substitution.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.040
I like, my life
always feels simpler

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.500
when I do one little
substitution at a time.

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.470
And so one little
substitution I could do

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.700
is to simplify this
x minus r thing.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.600
I could just shift this by r.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.560
So I'm just going to do a
little linear substitution.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:57.600
I'm going to do u
equals x minus big R,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.970
or I'm going to want to
substitute the other way,

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:06.050
so that's the same thing as
saying x equals u plus big R.

00:13:06.050 --> 00:13:11.460
And so du equals dx.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.110
This is a simple
little substitution.

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:15.980
And I'm going to have
to move the bounds,

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:22.680
so when x is big R minus little
r, then u is minus little r,

00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:25.600
and this top bound here, u is
going to be equal to little r.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.620
Positive little r.

00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:30.810
So let me just make
that substitution.

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:35.340
So area is 2 pi little
r, integral from

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:37.880
minus little r to plus little r.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:44.390
So x is u plus big
R divided by, now

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:48.930
this thing becomes square root
of little r squared minus u

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:51.510
squared du.

00:13:54.697 --> 00:13:55.280
OK, all right.

00:13:55.280 --> 00:14:01.990
So now-- this is really kind
of two separate pieces, right,

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:04.190
for purposes of
difficulty of integrating.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:07.154
There's the u over the
square root of r squared

00:14:07.154 --> 00:14:08.570
minus u squared
piece, and there's

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.280
the big R over the
square root of r

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:12.640
squared minus u squared piece.

00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:15.440
So let's think about
them separately.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.050
So for this first piece,
the u over the square root

00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:21.550
of little r squared
minus u squared,

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.610
this is something
you can integrate.

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:27.260
This is a-- you don't need a
trig substitution to do that.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.230
But it's actually-- you don't
need to do any work to do that.

00:14:31.230 --> 00:14:35.460
Because that function u
divided by square root

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.280
of little r squared
minus u squared,

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.110
that's an odd function.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.860
Right?

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:44.820
This part, the denominator
is even, u is odd,

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:46.870
and we're integrating
over an interval that's

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:48.260
symmetric around the origin.

00:14:48.260 --> 00:14:51.610
So when we integrate this u
divided by this denominator

00:14:51.610 --> 00:14:57.700
part between u from minus r to
r, that's just going to give 0.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.410
So I can forget
about that entirely.

00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:02.450
So this is nice.

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:04.000
And then I'll have
a constant here,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.740
so I'm going to factor
that out as well.

00:15:05.740 --> 00:15:09.780
So I get 2 pi little
r big R, integral

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:17.890
from minus r to r of du over the
square root of little r squared

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.780
minus u squared.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.820
OK.

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:24.320
Good.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.700
So far, so good.

00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.770
So we've got this
nice simplified

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:29.710
form for the integral.

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.090
So now this is screaming
out trig substitution to me.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:34.590
Right?

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:35.839
There's nothing else I can do.

00:15:35.839 --> 00:15:37.650
So there's sort of two
things you could do.

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:42.550
One is you could recognize
this as an integral related

00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:45.080
to arcsine, just because
you remember that.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:47.850
The other is, you have this r
squared minus u squared thing.

00:15:47.850 --> 00:15:50.890
And so r squared
minus u squared, that

00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.860
needs a trig substitution
of some sort,

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.000
and the relevant trig
substitution that you

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.530
would want to do,
is you would want

00:15:57.530 --> 00:16:07.290
to set u equal to r sine t.

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:07.790
Why?

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:11.630
Because then down here we'll
have r squared minus r squared

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:15.380
sine t, or if you factor out
the little r, that's just 1

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.310
minus sine squared t,
which is cosine squared t,

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:20.810
and then you take a square root,
and you're all good, right?

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.300
Square root of cosine squared t.

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.820
OK.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.660
So we find this
trig substitution.

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.220
So if we do u equals
r sine t, that's good.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:38.400
So du, then, is r
cosine t dt, and I

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.620
need to change the bounds, so
minus u is equal to minus r

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:46.800
when sine of t is
equal to minus 1.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.700
So that's at minus pi over 2.

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:51.810
And u is equal to r when
sine of t is equal to 1.

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:53.360
So that's a pi over 2.

00:16:53.360 --> 00:17:00.270
So this is equal to 2 pi
little r big R integral

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:12.060
from minus pi over 2 to
pi over 2 of r cosine t dt

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:12.980
divided by-- OK.

00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:16.590
So then down here, we
have the square root

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:22.420
of r squared minus r
squared sine squared t.

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:29.440
And as we said, so r squared
minus r squared sine squared t,

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.950
this is r squared
cosine squared t.

00:17:31.950 --> 00:17:34.970
And then you take a square root,
and you just get r cosine t.

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:38.280
And so r cosine t
cancels r cosine t.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.040
So the integrand here
is actually 1, or 1 dt.

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:43.670
So that's really
easy to integrate.

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:45.934
You integrate a constant,
you just get-- well,

00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:47.850
the constant times the
length of the integral.

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:55.740
So this is equal to 2*pi*r*R
times the constant is 1,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:59.250
times the length of the
integral, which is another pi,

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:00.580
times pi.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:01.080
OK.

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:10.890
So this is equal to 2 pi squared
little r big R. But remember,

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:13.850
so far we've only
computed-- this is just

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:16.910
the top half of the torus, is
all we've ever talked about.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:20.210
So we want to get the whole
torus, you just double this.

00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:23.900
So you double this, and you
get the area of the whole torus

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:30.330
is 4 pi squared little r big
R, which is a nice formula.

00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:34.750
So quickly, just to
summarize what we've done.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:37.220
Standard setup.

00:18:37.220 --> 00:18:41.390
Here we did it, we're rotating
around the y-axis instead

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.100
of the x-axis.

00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:46.940
So this formula for
dA looks a little bit

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.340
different than what you
saw in class, mostly.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:55.180
But the thing to remember
is just that what goes here

00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.820
is the radius that this,
that your little segment is

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.057
traveling.

00:19:00.057 --> 00:19:02.140
And this is the circumference
that it's traveling,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.899
and so this is the area
of that little ribbon

00:19:04.899 --> 00:19:05.690
that it traces out.

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:06.930
So dA-- OK.

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:10.490
And then we just did, you
know, the sort of usual thing.

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.300
For your formula,
you need-- you know,

00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.440
you remember the formula for ds.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:18.230
Then you needed to find this
derivative and plug it in.

00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:21.460
And so after you've done all
that preparatory work then

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:24.700
you have your integrand set up.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.330
And once you set
up your integrand,

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:31.070
you do whatever integration
tools you can to hit it with.

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.450
So in our case, that was
simplifying substitution,

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:39.660
and then a nice observation that
we used here to simplify this,

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:41.330
that this part was odd.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.690
I mean, you could've-- you
didn't need that observation.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:46.050
You could have done the
problem perfectly well

00:19:46.050 --> 00:19:51.810
with another substitution there
to kill off that first part.

00:19:51.810 --> 00:19:54.970
And then, OK, and then
a trig substitution,

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:56.525
remembering that
this is an arcsine,

00:19:56.525 --> 00:19:59.960
or related to an arcsine,
to finish it off.

00:20:03.170 --> 00:20:07.520
And is there anything
else I want to say?

00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.784
I think that's-- oh, yes.

00:20:08.784 --> 00:20:10.450
There's one other
thing I wanted to say,

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:13.340
which is that we could have
done this slightly differently.

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.960
Which is, here we solved for
y explicitly in terms of x.

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.520
And it would have been
possible to carry this

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.690
through using implicit
differentiation instead.

00:20:22.690 --> 00:20:24.600
It would have
actually simplified--

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.400
I would have had to write
this square root of little r

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:31.340
squared minus x minus big R
quantity squared fewer times

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:33.690
if I'd done implicit
differentiation, starting

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:37.137
from this implicit
equation relating x and y.

00:20:37.137 --> 00:20:38.720
You have to be a
little careful there,

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.100
whether you're doing the whole
circle all at once, or just

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.630
the top half or the bottom half.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.870
But you could do it with
implicit differentiation

00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:48.150
instead, and maybe save
yourself a little bit

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:52.640
of messy-looking arithmetic.

00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.622
So I think I'll end there.

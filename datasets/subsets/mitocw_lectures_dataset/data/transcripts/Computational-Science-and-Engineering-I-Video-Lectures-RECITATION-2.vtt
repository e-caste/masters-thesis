00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.940
PROFESSOR STRANG: So this
is the first true review

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.860
session in 18.085.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.820
The last Wednesday, the
first Wednesday afternoon,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:38.450
was a brief review of
topics in linear algebra.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.720
But now we're into the course.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.500
We've done four lectures
on the first four sections

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.210
of the textbook and one
homework problem in and back

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.530
and a second homework
set for next Monday.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.490
So I'm ready for any questions,
including questions that are

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.090
on the homework if necessary.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.020
But anything at all.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.270
Or maybe I'll just
ask whether the pace,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.740
so this is really informal.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.580
Is the pace of the course, now
today's lecture had a lot in it

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.490
as I realized when I saw
that the board was still

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.330
full of 18.085 and
there was a little more

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.050
still to do because we didn't
finish the matrix part.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:33.000
But are you okay with the
sort of speed of the course?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.890
So that'll be one question.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.770
And then, what about specifics?

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.461
Somebody start off if you will.

00:01:42.461 --> 00:01:42.960
Anybody.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.620
Yes, thanks.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.617
AUDIENCE: Well, actually
I had a question

00:01:46.617 --> 00:01:47.950
about the lecture earlier today.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.325
PROFESSOR STRANG:
Okay, go ahead.

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:51.760
AUDIENCE: I was just going to
look it up in the text, but.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.135
PROFESSOR STRANG:
That's alright.

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:54.970
AUDIENCE: But haven't
had a chance to.

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.260
But, okay, so I'm
not really sure

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.950
how you take the
initial conditions

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.300
and apply them to
the ramp function

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.070
to actually get a solution.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.720
PROFESSOR STRANG: So that's
what luckily happens to be still

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.620
here on the board, right?

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.450
We've got these boundary--
I would call them

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:16.160
boundary conditions.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.940
So this is definitely,
we're in a part of math

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.400
that's about boundary
value problems

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.470
more than-- time
isn't in the picture.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.350
I mean later time will
get into the picture.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:37.540
So with this particular
example, the general solution

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.540
is a standard ramp at the point
a where things are happening.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.360
Plus the C+Dx, the usual.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.270
So that's a particular solution.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:59.060
That particular solution has the
right behavior at the impulse.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.940
By the right behavior, I mean
that the second derivative

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:10.500
of the ramp is a delta and
when I put the ramp at a,

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.760
then the delta
will show up at a.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.850
And when I put on
that minus sign

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.950
it'll mean that the second
derivative is minus the delta.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.140
So the slope will step down.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.940
So that's a particular solution.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.220
But that by itself, what
does that equal at zero?

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.420
And what does that equal at
one if you remember the ramp?

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.770
So let me just draw
that ramp again.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.680
So the ramp was really based
on, centered at the point a.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.760
And I'll put it
with a minus sign.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.120
So it came along
there and down there.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.330
And now suppose this is
one end of our interval

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.480
and that's the other end.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.420
So is that ramp the
answer to our problem?

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.950
No.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.730
Well it happens to satisfy
this boundary condition,

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.130
happens to start out at zero.

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.710
But it doesn't end up at zero.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:19.150
So just like every particular
solution we need a little more.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.630
We have to include
more solutions

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.010
because that was only one.

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:26.100
All those are equally
good solutions.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.050
If I add C+Dx, the second
derivative of that is zero,

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.100
so it doesn't spoil
anything at all.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.750
On the contrary, it
adds more solutions.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.380
I mean the great
thing we're using here

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.630
is that our equations
are linear and when

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.560
zero's on the
right-hand side-- notice

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.300
there's no arbitrary constant.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.220
I'm not putting an
arbitrary constant

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.320
on that particular solution.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.110
Is one particular
solution plus a

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:02.890
subspace if I use that language.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.980
A lot of solutions to
the-- All the solutions

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.840
to the problem with zero
on the right-hand side.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.230
And these are the
solutions, these

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.350
are the null space guys,
the ones that have zero

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.410
on the right-hand side.

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.410
Now we need those.

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.190
And the effect of those
will be to move that ramp.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.880
And effectively, what
are they going to do?

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.620
They're going to swing that
ramp around, it'll stay a ramp.

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.750
But instead of being
level here, it'll go up.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.810
And instead of going down
there, it'll go down there.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.020
It'll be the same
ramp, with still

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.810
that slope dropped by one.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.460
Slope went down by
minus one and that's not

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.920
going to change here.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.380
The slope will still
go down by minus one.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:03.450
But now I've just adjusted
it so that it goes through

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:06.090
the-- it satisfies the
boundary conditions.

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:11.690
And in the second problem
with the free end,

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:14.630
again, here's my ramp.

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:16.240
But now I'm going to adjust it.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.410
And what happened?

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:20.470
It just needed
adjustment upwards.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.890
Because this was the zero,
this was the u=0 fixed guy.

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:31.740
And now if I'm doing
u'(0)=0, the free guy,

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.320
I can lift the whole thing up.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.290
So you see, I just
lifted it up to the point

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.390
where it came out right there.

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:44.200
So in this case I just
needed a C. And in this case

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.330
I just needed a Dx.

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.170
And in other cases I
might have needed both.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:51.910
A little bit of C
and a little of Dx.

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:58.000
Anyway that's what was--
maybe that's sort of repeating

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.270
what we did today a little bit.

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:08.670
But mechanically it's just,
we've got a particular solution

00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:12.790
and we've got the
complete solution

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.840
and then we just have
to choose C and D

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.330
and we've got two
conditions to do it with,

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:20.790
the two boundary conditions.

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.470
Could have other
boundary conditions.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.040
Now, what about, here's a, yeah.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.560
I guess what will often happen
in these review sessions is

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.410
I get on a roll and I just
keep, carry on with it.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:37.210
You know, you start me with
a question and I can't stop.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:42.890
So I'll go a little longer but
then I really will stop, ready

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:45.050
for the next one.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.360
So we haven't discussed
the free-free. u(0) equal--

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.260
u', sorry, free is u'.

00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:00.710
That's free at the left
and free at the right.

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:04.580
What's up with that?

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.070
What's the solution to that?

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:13.490
Again, I'm looking for
-u'' equal an impulse.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.920
With those two boundary
conditions, free-free.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.510
And do you know what's
going to happen?

00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:22.150
No solution.

00:08:22.150 --> 00:08:25.740
Now it'd be interesting
to see why not.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.130
Why no solution?

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.030
Well one way to do it is try.

00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:36.000
Other right-hand sides
could have a solution.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.280
So it's not just that this is--
something's the matter here.

00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:44.940
Specifically, that right-hand
side and most right-hand sides

00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:46.220
will fail.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.850
But let's just see
it with this one.

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.620
Why does that fail?

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:56.880
Well you can see I can't,
the slope here is zero

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.570
and the slope here is minus one.

00:08:59.570 --> 00:09:04.540
If I adjust those
I can't get, this

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.440
is asking me to get
slope zero at both ends.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.610
I can't do that, right?

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:17.130
Yeah, just not possible for me
to-- This will add a straight

00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:19.160
line but it's the
same straight--

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.210
I can't get a ramp that
comes flat at both ends

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:27.050
because there's-- once I say
what it's doing at the ends,

00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:28.160
I've got it.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.530
And you see what I mean?

00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:37.340
I'm looking for one that
starts flat and ends flat

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:45.620
and that's not in my
family of solutions.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.480
That problem just
doesn't have a solution.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.440
So that's one way to do it,
is look at the solutions

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.720
and realize you can't satisfy
both boundary conditions.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.150
Another way might be this.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:06.250
This is a little bit deeper
way and it leads to something

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:07.540
better.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.540
Suppose I take the integral.

00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.360
So this is an equation
that's supposed to hold.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:18.160
Let me integrate both
sides from zero to one.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.040
So there's the idea
I'm putting in now.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:23.380
To go a little
further, to discover

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.430
when this has a solution.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:28.080
Or let me take more
generally, -u''=f(x).

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.240
So some other load.

00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:37.210
Not necessarily a point load,
not necessarily a uniform load,

00:10:37.210 --> 00:10:39.030
but maybe some other load.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.780
And now my boundary conditions,
I'm trying to do free-free.

00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:48.400
And usually no solution.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.540
But let's just see why and
when there might be a solution.

00:10:52.540 --> 00:11:02.530
The key idea is integrate
from zero to one.

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.140
What do I get on
the right-hand side?

00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.280
Well, I get the integral
of f, whatever it is,

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.260
and I would call
that the total load.

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:16.650
Fair enough?

00:11:16.650 --> 00:11:21.300
The total load of-- If
it was a delta function,

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:24.900
the total load would be one and
it would be all in one spot.

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:28.570
If it was uniformly
over the whole interval,

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:31.340
well I guess that would
also integrate to one,

00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:33.900
so the total load would
be one spread out.

00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.560
But it could be a mixture of
the two, could be a few delta

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.530
functions, whatever.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:45.070
What happens when I integrate
the left side from zero to one?

00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:46.510
Can you do that one?

00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:47.980
The integral from zero to one.

00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:52.290
There's that dopey
minus sign. u''dx.

00:11:52.290 --> 00:11:55.220
What do I get?

00:11:55.220 --> 00:11:59.190
Why do I say that's a good idea?

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:02.370
If I integrate the
second derivative

00:12:02.370 --> 00:12:05.549
I get the first derivative.

00:12:05.549 --> 00:12:07.090
The integral of the
second derivative

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:11.020
will be the first
derivative with the minus.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.740
So it's minus the
first derivative.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:16.350
And what do I do now?

00:12:16.350 --> 00:12:18.970
I plug in the end points, right?

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:19.640
You integrate.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:20.990
I'm integrating zero to one.

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:22.650
So I've found the integral.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.100
I've put zero to one in there.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.770
So what is that?

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:33.210
That's minus the
derivative at one

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:40.820
plus the derivative at zero.

00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.870
And now, what's that?

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.010
That's zero.

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:47.610
By my boundary
conditions, that's zero.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:49.890
So what have I found?

00:12:49.890 --> 00:12:52.980
I've found that if these are the
boundary conditions, then when

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:57.120
I integrate the left side
it's going to give me zero.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:03.740
So when, what loads
could be okay?

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:14.480
What loads f(x) could allow
me to solve this equation?

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.550
The condition will
be I need, what do I

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:24.260
need for the total load to be
able to solve this equation?

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.500
The integral of the
left side was zero

00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:31.710
so the integral of the right
side had better be zero.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:34.740
So that's the condition.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:36.590
If I have these
boundary conditions,

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:38.430
then my problem is singular.

00:13:38.430 --> 00:13:40.090
Usually no solution.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.580
It's like having
a singular matrix.

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.920
It's like having this particular
singular matrix, of course.

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:48.530
Whoops, not that one.

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:51.700
Let me get the plus sign
in the right position.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.330
That's a plus.

00:13:53.330 --> 00:13:57.400
-1; -1, 2, -1; -1, 1.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.380
Right?

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:08.080
This is the discrete version
with a zero slope at both ends.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:10.540
It's our T matrix.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:12.880
No, what matrix is it?

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:18.880
B. It's our B matrix, both ends.

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.120
I'll just come back here and
then I'll do the discrete one.

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:26.930
So tell me a load
that we could handle?

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:30.060
A load we could handle.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.700
So the integral has to be zero.

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:39.640
So suppose my load has
a delta function at a.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:42.030
Well that integral is one.

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:45.860
So can you fix that,
change that load

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.590
or do something, maybe
put on another load

00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:53.770
to get a total load of zero?

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:55.980
What shall I do?

00:14:55.980 --> 00:14:59.650
Add another guy
with a minus sign.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:04.710
In other words,
maybe this, a delta

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.380
function at some other point b.

00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.890
Well, that would do it.

00:15:08.890 --> 00:15:11.190
I believe we could
solve that problem.

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:18.470
Even with these bad
boundary conditions.

00:15:18.470 --> 00:15:20.170
We could solve that problem.

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:23.530
Because the total load would
be, one from that, minus one

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:27.290
from that, the total
load would be zero.

00:15:27.290 --> 00:15:30.290
In other words, what would
are solution look like?

00:15:30.290 --> 00:15:32.810
It has to start with zero slope.

00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.520
So it would buzz alone
to a and then after b.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.890
And what does it
have to do here?

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:44.050
If I graph the
solution to this guy

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:48.570
from zero to one it
starts with, it's

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:51.480
free, so nothing's
happening until I get to a.

00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.940
Then what has to happen?

00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.980
Let's see, if I'm
graphing u, it'll be ramp.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.480
Right?

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:02.690
It'll be a ramp, yeah.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.320
Because I've two derivatives.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:11.110
And it has to ramp down by one,
so it'll ramp whatever it does.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.540
I don't know where it stops.

00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:16.190
Where does it?

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.150
Wait a minute.

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:21.150
I haven't practiced this.

00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:26.000
So I start from the other end.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.120
The other end is flat.

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.580
What's up?

00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.830
They gotta meet here.

00:16:36.830 --> 00:16:38.790
Oh, the other end is
flat, but not at zero!

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:39.780
Dumb, stupid.

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.280
Right.

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.040
Okay.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:43.340
Yes, the other end
is flat, right.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.050
And it's, oh yeah, look!

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:46.500
Oh, wonderful.

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.850
You see.

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.720
That slope dropped by
one and the slope there

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.130
increased by one back to zero.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:56.490
Slope was zero.

00:16:56.490 --> 00:17:00.460
It dropped to minus one
because of that load.

00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:03.030
Now it increased
back to zero because

00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:07.080
of this load with the minus
sign and there's a solution.

00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:10.020
So that's a solvable problem.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:12.330
Well, you say, okay, that
was a little surprising

00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.020
to get an answer for
a singular problem.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.990
And no, it can happen.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:21.850
If we have a total
load zero it'll happen.

00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:28.900
But, there is still a but,
that's not the only answer.

00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.780
That picture is a solution.

00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.310
But not the only one.

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:37.090
So what my point is
going to be, that when

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:40.140
the problem is singular,
if there's an answer,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:41.390
you say great.

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:44.710
But then something has to
go wrong and what goes wrong

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.140
is too many answers.

00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:54.440
So tell me some more, what other
graphs would draw solutions

00:17:54.440 --> 00:18:00.350
to this problem.

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:04.430
I could shift, I could
lift the whole thing.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:07.430
Here I've got a plus
C that I haven't used.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:10.480
I could just do the
whole thing higher up.

00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:11.260
Any of these.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:17.160
These would all work.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.470
It's like temperature.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:23.500
I don't have an absolute
temperature here.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:29.470
All I've got is, I would
have to-- It's not determined

00:18:29.470 --> 00:18:35.800
because there's a plus C
that-- the plus C satisfied

00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:37.050
everything.

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:41.270
A plus C, a constant has zero
slope, it has zero slope,

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:42.750
its second derivative is zero.

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:48.330
So it's like, unseen
by this equation.

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:50.890
And similarly can I
just make the analogy

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:55.440
as I always like to do with
discrete stuff, so suppose I--

00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:02.100
Tell me a right-hand side
that we think would probably,

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.320
is this going to be the
same story for this guy?

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.250
Yes.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:10.750
If I add those, where
I integrated there,

00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.940
here I would add and I
get zero, zero, zero.

00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.740
So this has to add to zero
if there's a solution.

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:22.270
So let me put for
example, [0,  1, -1].

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:26.800
That would be kind of like our
delta function in one direction

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.550
and our delta
function in the other.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:31.860
I believe I can
solve that problem.

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:34.540
So I'm just carrying,
because I always

00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:39.970
want you to see the discrete
one as well as the continuous.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:43.430
Continuous involved
this integration.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.310
The finite one just
involves adding.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:50.870
The left side adds to zero
so the right-hand side better

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:52.140
add to zero.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.540
That right-hand side does.

00:19:53.540 --> 00:19:54.770
Tell me a solution.

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:57.620
Well, let me start out
with a seven there.

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:04.250
What's the next guy going to be?

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.880
See, I want seven.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:10.540
Whatever I put there, I better
have a seven there, right?

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.680
Seven, seven, good.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.150
Minus seven, plus 14, oh geez.

00:20:16.150 --> 00:20:22.180
I didn't know this
was going to happen.

00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:26.160
No, I want to get
the answer one.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.250
What number goes there?

00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.940
Six, is it six?

00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.780
It's six, yeah, good.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:34.610
Minus seven, 14,
minus six is that.

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.540
And now my claim is
that we'll come out

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.440
right on the third equation.

00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:40.920
So far I've just
matched the first two.

00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.780
Now this one gives
minus seven, plus six,

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:45.750
that's minus one, good.

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:48.780
So there's a solution.

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:51.310
And I'll leave
this problem alone

00:20:51.310 --> 00:20:54.670
if you tell me the
rest, other solutions.

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:59.670
That [7, 7, 6] was a solution
to a singular problem

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:02.690
with a right-hand side
that had total load zero,

00:21:02.690 --> 00:21:04.380
so it was okay.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:08.530
But now that's a solution,
but there are more.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:13.550
Tell me another one.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.720
I can shift it, right?

00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.330
I could make it [17, 17, 16].

00:21:18.330 --> 00:21:21.091
I could add ten to everything.

00:21:21.091 --> 00:21:21.590
Right?

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:24.830
That's the plus C that
I could do over there.

00:21:24.830 --> 00:21:30.590
That can't change because
17 - 17 is still zero.

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:33.400
-17 + 16 will
still be minus one.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:35.370
All good.

00:21:35.370 --> 00:21:39.280
So actually that just
like helps our intuition,

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:42.170
and physically my
intuition is this.

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:49.180
That I've got this bar
and nothing's holding it.

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:57.210
So if I put a weight on it,
nothing to hold it, it'll just,

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.030
rigid motion will take
it out of sight, no good.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:02.380
But if I put another
equal weight on it,

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.470
no it's not a weight.

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:04.220
What do I call it?

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.870
If I lift it at
that point, that's

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.940
the other delta function
that's going the other way,

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.640
then it will sit there.

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:17.310
But it would still
be in equilibrium

00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:21.310
if I just moved it up to
there or moved it as I like.

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:26.690
I don't know if that is
kind of a dumb picture.

00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:31.780
But it's saying what
we've said from math.

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:33.940
Well, you see where
your question led.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:44.440
Yeah, thanks.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:49.300
No, the integral, it was--
Watch what we integrated.

00:22:49.300 --> 00:22:50.460
We integrated u''.

00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.940
So that's not the area.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:59.580
We integrated u'' and
got its integral was u'.

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:02.150
So that just told
us that a difference

00:23:02.150 --> 00:23:05.270
in slopes at the ends, yeah.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.904
Good, because our
intuition automatically

00:23:08.904 --> 00:23:10.320
is if we're
integrating something,

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:11.740
we're finding an area.

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:16.210
But here, if it was u , then
I'd be finding the area under u,

00:23:16.210 --> 00:23:19.910
but we integrated the
second derivative.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.420
Right, good.

00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:24.810
Now let's change the subject.

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:33.520
Yes, please.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:34.920
Yeah, I guess so.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:44.090
I'll try.

00:23:44.090 --> 00:23:45.100
Let's see.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:53.080
So my discrete
equation was like -u...

00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:57.160
Yeah, so let's back
up to the beginning.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.510
We've got this
minus sign and we're

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:00.720
using a second difference.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.880
So second differences
have coefficients

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:06.360
one, minus two and one.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.120
Now I'm reversing the
signs because of my minus.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:13.650
So I have -u at some point.

00:24:13.650 --> 00:24:17.020
Let's take that as
the point to the left.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:22.000
Two u's at what I'll think
of as the center point,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.160
minus u_(i-1).

00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:29.680
Is the load at that center.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:37.180
That center point
is i times delta x.

00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.820
That's where I would be looking.

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:44.320
So now I'm using subscript.

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.190
It's a little bit of practice
then to take subscripts, take

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:57.090
this way of writing the equation
and convert it to a matrix way.

00:24:57.090 --> 00:25:01.010
It's usually clearer once
you see it as a matrix.

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:04.850
Now this is happening
at all the points.

00:25:04.850 --> 00:25:24.610
At i=1, let's say, I have
-u_0+2u_1-u_2 is f at, agrees

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:30.010
with the load at the
first mesh point.

00:25:30.010 --> 00:25:36.060
That's the center,
the point h delta x.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:42.330
And then if I want to back up
further, I would have -u_(-1),

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:49.860
but that doesn't really exist,
plus 2u_0-u_1 should match

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:55.750
the load at zero.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:57.980
And so on forward.

00:25:57.980 --> 00:26:00.299
But now I want to put in
the boundary condition.

00:26:00.299 --> 00:26:01.840
That's what you want
me to do, right?

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.840
Put in this boundary condition.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:11.720
So what am I going to take
as boundary condition?

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:14.000
It has to be some
approximation to u'(0)=0.

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.510
Maybe I'm never going
to get to minus one.

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:33.870
Maybe I don't need minus one.

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:38.020
That's right, yeah, exactly.

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:41.530
We did.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.790
That's what we knew about it.

00:26:42.790 --> 00:26:45.220
Sending it forward, we knew
about forward difference,

00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:51.360
so I chose to do it.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.700
But then I think better of it.

00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:57.650
I chose to do it because it
made the point that we, that

00:26:57.650 --> 00:27:02.140
at that boundary we were
introducing a higher order

00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:08.020
error, first order error
that's going to wreck things.

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:13.350
I mean, it's going to spoil the,
this is second order accuracy.

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:17.520
And, but let me do
that first order.

00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.480
So what shall I take?

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:22.400
I'm going to approximate
that by u-- Shall

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:33.260
I take this one
as I did in class?

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.850
Yes.

00:27:35.850 --> 00:27:39.560
Ah, plus one, thanks, plus
one, right, thank you.

00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:42.370
Thank you, good.

00:27:42.370 --> 00:27:44.940
Okeydoke.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.200
Alright.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.000
This is how we got
to that equation.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.390
If I now bring in this
boundary condition--

00:27:53.390 --> 00:27:57.110
I guess I don't have to,
let me take your eye off

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:02.530
of that guy for the
moment, I think.

00:28:02.530 --> 00:28:05.140
We're getting
beautiful music here.

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.210
Is it coming out of this box or?

00:28:07.210 --> 00:28:08.420
No.

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:14.100
Anyway.

00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:17.730
So I'm going to use
this boundary condition

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.280
to say, well okay,
if u_1 is u_0,

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:23.800
I'm going to replace
this u_0 by u_1.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:28.680
This is the direct way.

00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.290
I replaced that u_0 by u_1
in that first equation.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:38.130
And then what I have is -u_1
and 2u_1, so that's the one

00:28:38.130 --> 00:28:40.660
and I have the -u_2.

00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:44.640
So do you see that that
equation, when I put those

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:53.650
together into a one, is
going to-- If this is u_1,

00:28:53.650 --> 00:28:58.190
this is u_2, this is u_3
onwards, that first equation is

00:28:58.190 --> 00:29:03.600
u_1-u_2 and that's
what I've got.

00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.190
This is u_1-u_2.

00:29:09.070 --> 00:29:10.760
So I did it.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:12.150
I got to that matrix.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:15.530
The matrix is actually
quite an important matrix.

00:29:15.530 --> 00:29:19.440
But from the point
of view of accuracy

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.120
in solving this
differential equation,

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.220
it's not the greatest.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.080
It's lost accuracy
at that point.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:30.070
But the way to
recover it turned out

00:29:30.070 --> 00:29:35.340
to be just a small adjustment at
the boundary, so not a problem.

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:35.880
Thanks.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.490
That's good.

00:29:36.490 --> 00:29:41.040
Yes, thanks.

00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:48.877
Sorry?

00:29:48.877 --> 00:29:49.960
When the boundary-- sorry.

00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:55.390
Two boundary conditions
at the same point?

00:29:55.390 --> 00:29:57.070
That's a good question.

00:29:57.070 --> 00:29:59.510
So when would we have two?

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:02.160
So instead of a boundary
condition at zero

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.120
and a boundary condition at
one, you're putting them,

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.200
is that what you mean?

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.860
Put both boundary
conditions at the end.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.000
Okay.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.830
So that would be,
that would happen,

00:30:13.830 --> 00:30:15.440
I would think that
would be more,

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.370
it would be very
typical in a, let

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:22.430
me see if there's
some space here, yeah.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:28.190
That would be very
typical and we will do it,

00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:30.220
can I change x to t?

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:38.060
Because that's what,
if I have some.

00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:39.780
What does this
problem look like?

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:45.230
And u(0)=0 and u'(0)=0.

00:30:45.230 --> 00:30:52.260
Both at the same, at the
start equals zero or whatever.

00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:56.400
So what kind of a
problem is that?

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.600
Now these are, I would
say, initial values.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.270
Initial values
instead of boundary

00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.550
values, I now have
initial values.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.840
And can I solve it?

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:10.020
Yes.

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.890
So I'm starting at time zero.

00:31:11.890 --> 00:31:14.880
This is t=0.

00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.440
I'm starting at rest.

00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:23.180
No velocity and actually
no displacement and just

00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.850
going forward in time.

00:31:25.850 --> 00:31:30.100
So I could solve that
differential equation.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.620
I'd be interested in the
corresponding difference

00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:36.170
equation.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:37.970
All fine.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:39.960
It's a different
category of problem.

00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:49.670
This is an initial
value problem.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:32:00.460
It's like tracking some
mass that's, some satellite.

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:04.790
So that's what you're doing
in tracking a satellite

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:09.360
or a planet or something.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.860
Yeah, tracking a
planet or a satellite.

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.630
You're solving
equations like this.

00:32:16.630 --> 00:32:18.770
Forward in time.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:21.760
You know the initial
position and you

00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.070
know the forces acting on it.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:26.650
Probably gravity.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:28.640
And you go forward in time.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.810
Yes.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:33.657
What would the matrix be?

00:32:33.657 --> 00:32:34.240
Good question.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:41.620
What would the matrix look like?

00:32:41.620 --> 00:32:46.810
So an electrical engineer
would call a problem like this,

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.080
and the kind of matrix that
I'm going to write down,

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.650
I think, would be called causal.

00:32:53.650 --> 00:32:57.710
That word just popped into my
head, so let me mention it.

00:32:57.710 --> 00:33:01.210
You know, part of science and
engineering, a big part of it

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:04.440
is learning language,
learning words.

00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:09.360
And you have to learn
sort of the math language

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.790
and the engineering language
for whatever you're focusing on.

00:33:14.790 --> 00:33:19.410
But it's good to also to
know a few other languages.

00:33:19.410 --> 00:33:21.950
Electrical engineering
languages of filters

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:28.030
and causal and other things
that we'll see are important.

00:33:28.030 --> 00:33:32.120
What would the matrix look like?

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.860
Here's what I think it would be.

00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:42.320
I've made this a plus there
so I'll have to remember that.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:46.720
I think, so I'm looking
at u_0, u_1-- No.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.646
Well, u_0 I actually
know, so let

00:33:48.646 --> 00:33:50.020
me start with u_1,
u_2, u_3, u_4.

00:33:55.310 --> 00:33:58.671
What would a typical-- Equal
sum, right side, f_1, f_2,

00:33:58.671 --> 00:33:59.170
f_3, f_4.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:06.710
What do you think, what kind
of a matrix am I going to get?

00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:09.490
Before I put it in there.

00:34:09.490 --> 00:34:11.620
This is a good question.

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:14.690
What's the shape of this matrix?

00:34:14.690 --> 00:34:19.200
It's going to be triangular.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.530
Instead of being symmetric
it's going to be triangular.

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:25.540
I'm going to find, let's
see, a typical value

00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:35.570
would be, say, u_3 because
I've used a plus sign, oops!

00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:39.540
I can't make myself do it right.

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.070
1, -2, 1.

00:34:44.070 --> 00:34:54.695
That would say u_3-2u_2+u_1
would be the new force.

00:34:54.695 --> 00:34:56.570
This is the kind of
thing we're going to get.

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:59.547
One, maybe one something.

00:34:59.547 --> 00:35:00.630
I don't know what this is.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:03.460
This is up in the boundary,
in the initial values.

00:35:03.460 --> 00:35:10.060
But from now on it'll
be below the diagonal.

00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:15.470
It'll be 1, -2, 1.

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:17.390
Do you see?

00:35:17.390 --> 00:35:20.050
We're marching.

00:35:20.050 --> 00:35:25.140
We're marching forward.

00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:27.660
We start by knowing
these and then

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:29.690
the equation tells
us the next one.

00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:31.730
Then the equation
tells us the next one.

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.560
That's what initial
value problems do.

00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:38.610
You're told how you begin
and you take a step,

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:41.090
you take a step, take
a step every time.

00:35:41.090 --> 00:35:47.140
And the new value just needs
to know the older values.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:52.220
Do you see the big difference
between that and our problems

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.440
here?

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:57.840
Our problem is
looking left and right

00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:00.500
looking for back and forward.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.800
Back for one condition,
forward for another.

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:07.470
We start with one, but
we're, it's more of a,

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:10.340
it's like a hitting problem.

00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:15.150
We start forward, marching
forward in our problems,

00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:19.240
but we have to hit the
other end correctly.

00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:22.600
We don't know the slope, we
don't know the starting slope,

00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:24.630
we know what we want to hit.

00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:32.340
Whereas these problems, we're
told how we start and we just

00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:34.380
follow it in time.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:40.260
So that's the difference here.

00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:49.680
Yeah, sure, okay.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.710
That's true.

00:36:51.710 --> 00:36:54.600
So this'll be known.

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.290
Yeah, that'll be known.

00:36:56.290 --> 00:36:58.550
Yeah. u_1 will also be known.

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:02.360
Yeah, and really, maybe
I should have got,

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:06.060
let me put even the
other known one.

00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.380
So we know this, we know this.

00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:12.000
So those are sort
of not in our, yeah,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:23.500
that shouldn't be in
our problem somehow.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.197
No, I think, what would
we get in the end?

00:37:27.197 --> 00:37:28.530
You're always looking backwards.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:29.630
That's the point.

00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:32.580
Lower triangular matrices
are always looking,

00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:35.020
they only look backwards
for earlier values

00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.110
and then they give
you the current value.

00:37:37.110 --> 00:37:41.620
So that's why lower triangular
matrices are so easy to invert.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:42.330
No problem.

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:46.840
If it's lower triangular, you
just, like, march forward.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.740
And if it's upper triangular,
which way do you march?

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:53.490
So if you have an upper
triangular problem,

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:57.620
suppose I gave you
the problem, let

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.050
me make it upper triangular.

00:37:59.050 --> 00:37:59.570
So x+y+z=7.

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.760
2y+3z=12 and z=17.

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.980
So that's upper triangular.

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:17.150
Where do we start
in solving that one?

00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:18.490
From the bottom.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.930
From the right-hand
end, the bottom.

00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:25.150
And we march backwards in time.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:29.490
And what I was saying
about A, well L times U,

00:38:29.490 --> 00:38:31.910
yeah, this is worth seeing.

00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:38.840
What I was saying about A=LU,
it was, you remember that?

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.070
Those letters?

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:45.030
What that was saying was
that this matrix that's

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:51.900
looking both ways can be written
as a product of a matrix L

00:38:51.900 --> 00:38:59.030
that looks behind for old values
and you can go forward with it.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:05.020
And a matrix U, like this one,
this upper triangular, 1, 1, 1,

00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:10.920
zeroes below that diagonal,
that you go backward with.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.750
Somehow that's appealing.

00:39:12.750 --> 00:39:18.590
That's like aesthetic to
break up a two-way problem

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:24.140
into a problem that marches
one way and then the other.

00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:28.530
And of course, that's
what elimination aims for,

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:33.190
is this problem that it can
solve by, the words would be,

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:35.030
back substitution.

00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.390
When you've started with
your original problem, got

00:39:37.390 --> 00:39:42.020
to this one, then you just
have a back substitution,

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:44.880
you go backwards.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.030
Oh, so much, I'll mention
the Kalman filter.

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:53.510
That's a similar process
of going forward,

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.120
that's called prediction.

00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.410
Going backward, that's
called smoothing.

00:39:57.410 --> 00:40:00.750
And so, Kalman
had the great idea

00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:05.640
that he could break
these problems that

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:14.030
were fundamental in
space computations

00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:19.350
into prediction and smoothing.

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:20.870
Once again, we've got off.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:25.630
Yes?

00:40:25.630 --> 00:40:28.420
Oh, the beam.

00:40:28.420 --> 00:40:33.520
Let me help you even
more before the question.

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:39.070
I said it's better to
draw the beam this way.

00:40:39.070 --> 00:40:41.270
I like the beam better this way.

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:46.310
Because the point of the beam
problem is loads are acting --

00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:48.360
and we'll see this,
of course, later --

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:54.860
loads are acting perpendicular
to the direction of the beam.

00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:57.010
That's why the beam bends.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:41:00.460
So it'll bend a little, right?

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:04.250
And that is what leads
us, its bending moments

00:41:04.250 --> 00:41:05.820
and other stuff.

00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.900
If you haven't met
beams, well, it'll

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:12.840
be great to just have a
very, half a lecture about,

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:15.800
or maybe a lecture about beams.

00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:19.860
That gives a fourth
order equation

00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:21.560
that I'll write down again.

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.970
Fourth derivative
equal the load.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:39.630
Now, ready.

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:42.990
Yeah, now here I don't
have the negative sign.

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:47.170
Because once I've got
second derivatives twice,

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:52.520
so the second derivative
is, in some way, negative.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:55.090
I'll complete that
sentence in a second.

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:57.380
Somehow the second
derivative, which

00:41:57.380 --> 00:42:02.540
is the guy that has the
1, -2, 1, somehow that's

00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:04.340
a negative thing.

00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:07.310
But fourth derivative
is second derivative

00:42:07.310 --> 00:42:08.670
of the second derivative.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:12.560
Yeah, do you want to tell me
what the numbers would be?

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:17.640
As long as we're wildly looking
forward to fourth derivatives,

00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.260
just, it helps.

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:28.320
Do you want to guess what will
a typical row of the matrix B

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:32.830
when I go to finite
differences, fourth differences?

00:42:32.830 --> 00:42:36.130
Probably you've never
seen a fourth difference.

00:42:36.130 --> 00:42:38.710
You may not have seen
second differences before.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:43.240
That was a big deal, then, to
introduce second differences.

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:46.050
Those 1, -2, 1's.

00:42:46.050 --> 00:42:48.600
That was second differences.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.520
Fourth?

00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:53.270
Yeah, 1, 4, 6, 4,
1 with minus sign.

00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:58.290
1, -4, 6, -4, and 1.

00:42:58.290 --> 00:43:06.190
In some way, I would get
that by squaring this guy.

00:43:06.190 --> 00:43:17.710
So that would be a
fourth difference.

00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:19.880
Oh, what's the deal with
boundary conditions?

00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:25.070
What are you figuring,
on beams, beam problems,

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:28.630
for a fourth order equation
and a matrix that's

00:43:28.630 --> 00:43:30.430
stretching out further.

00:43:30.430 --> 00:43:35.670
What's going to happen at
the left-hand boundary?

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:39.970
I guess my specific question
is, how many boundary conditions

00:43:39.970 --> 00:43:41.580
do I now need?

00:43:41.580 --> 00:43:42.740
Four.

00:43:42.740 --> 00:43:44.880
And the typical is
two at each end.

00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.400
That's the balanced way.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:50.630
That's the way that would make
this matrix sort of symmetric.

00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:56.540
So maybe at this end I
say it's held at zero

00:43:56.540 --> 00:44:01.250
and maybe it's just
sitting on a log there.

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:02.260
Right?

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:06.900
That boundary condition I
would call simply supported.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.420
That boundary condition
says that u(0)=0.

00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.510
Because it's sitting there.

00:44:13.510 --> 00:44:17.150
And but the slope
doesn't have to be zero.

00:44:17.150 --> 00:44:20.590
What does have to be zero there?

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:23.560
Yeah, sort of the
bending moment.

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:27.780
Nobody's here
twisting it, right?

00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:30.840
So the other condition
in that picture

00:44:30.840 --> 00:44:36.140
would be second
derivative equal zero.

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:42.360
Maybe my point is that now
you see what I said before,

00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.830
that getting the boundary
conditions into the problem

00:44:46.830 --> 00:44:49.130
is often the hardest part.

00:44:49.130 --> 00:44:51.730
Because I have to
replace u(0)=0,

00:44:51.730 --> 00:44:53.550
that shouldn't be
too hard to do.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:57.430
But I have to use this
other condition somehow,

00:44:57.430 --> 00:45:01.820
it's going to screw up
the 1, -4, 6, -4, 1.

00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:06.140
I'll have two boundary
rows at the top,

00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:08.940
two boundary rows at the bottom.

00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:11.860
I don't want to
go further today.

00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.430
But I think maybe
just mentioning

00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:19.910
this gives you the
picture of sort

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:23.490
of the how things fit together.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:28.150
We would still have some
nice constant diagonals

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:29.610
in the middle,
but now we'll have

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:33.040
two boundary rows at each end.

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:36.750
So that's something to come.

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:44.980
Yes, now back to reality,
which is, any questions?

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:52.540
Lower triangular guy, yeah.

00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:56.380
What do I mean by
marching forward?

00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:01.240
So let's see.

00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:04.600
I'll replace this.

00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.310
Let's see it better.

00:46:06.310 --> 00:46:11.500
I would replace this by maybe
u, I'll use a different letter,

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.830
n+1.

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:26.360
At u_(n+1)-2u_n+u_(n-1)
is some right-hand side

00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:28.890
if there's a force
acting on my thing.

00:46:28.890 --> 00:46:32.390
So f_n maybe.

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:37.730
By marching forward, I just
mean that this equation--

00:46:37.730 --> 00:46:40.360
that I can go in order.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.290
I can start with u_0 and u_1.

00:46:43.290 --> 00:46:47.410
They come from the
boundary conditions.

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:51.880
Then this equation
will tell me u_2.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.470
I use the equation.

00:46:53.470 --> 00:46:54.790
With n as one.

00:46:54.790 --> 00:47:01.490
This says u_2, some u_1's, some
u_0's, f_1's, all that I know.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:07.450
In other words, once I get
started, I'm on a roll.

00:47:07.450 --> 00:47:10.520
If I have two boundary
conditions to get me started,

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:14.120
then the equation tells me u_2.

00:47:14.120 --> 00:47:21.240
And then the next time,
u_3-2u_2+u_1, I can find u_3.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:24.710
So I can get those,
I can go forever.

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:28.790
If you give me enough to
start on, two things to start,

00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:32.630
then I march forward.

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:37.120
Whereas in our problems, we've
only got one thing to start on

00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:39.400
and we've got one goal to hit.

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:44.090
And that's why we have to solve
the whole system together.

00:47:44.090 --> 00:47:48.600
This is, we can solve
it step-by-step.

00:47:48.600 --> 00:47:51.930
This is way faster of course.

00:47:51.930 --> 00:47:57.550
To be able to just
go forward in time.

00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:01.550
I'll mention that the topic
of initial value problems

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:07.590
and finite differences for
them, we can't get to that.

00:48:07.590 --> 00:48:10.370
So we're seeing a
little bit here,

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:16.740
but it's done properly in
18.086 in the second semester

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:20.620
is the initial value
problem start part.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:27.610
And that has it's own
interesting questions.

00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:33.310
Somehow we've talked about
fourth order equations,

00:48:33.310 --> 00:48:39.240
initial value problems.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:42.100
But no homework problems.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:46.280
So I'm ready for,
or even related.

00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:51.790
But that's fine with me.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:53.730
Is there a question?

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:54.400
Yeah, thanks.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.858
Or it doesn't have
to be a homework

00:48:55.858 --> 00:49:05.350
question, another question.

00:49:05.350 --> 00:49:09.240
Oh, good question.

00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:11.210
You mean I should just
send the homework out

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:13.430
to Natick where MATLAB is.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.420
Do you know that MATLAB
is just 15 miles away?

00:49:16.420 --> 00:49:22.410
I almost get there, I
live 2/3 of the way there.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:25.370
Yeah, so we could just send
the whole thing out there

00:49:25.370 --> 00:49:27.940
and get it back.

00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:36.150
That would save a lot of work.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:38.050
I suppose, I'm okay.

00:49:38.050 --> 00:49:40.400
Why should I say no?

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:43.410
Anything MATLAB can do
and you can make it do,

00:49:43.410 --> 00:49:45.060
I'm okay with that.

00:49:45.060 --> 00:49:48.270
I don't see that you have to
do things by hand if you've

00:49:48.270 --> 00:49:50.180
got a better way.

00:49:50.180 --> 00:49:50.780
That's okay.

00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:53.560
And then probably the
answer gets printed

00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.390
and you can graph it.

00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:57.960
So that's fine.

00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:03.020
So I mean, somehow a course like
this has got two parts to it.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:05.010
Applied math has
two parts to it.

00:50:05.010 --> 00:50:08.830
The modeling part, set up the
equation, think, what is it

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:10.260
you're supposed to do.

00:50:10.260 --> 00:50:13.080
And then, step two is do it.

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.390
The numerical part,
the computing part.

00:50:15.390 --> 00:50:19.620
And that's where MATLAB,
Python, Fortran, whatever,

00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:25.220
is going to do a lot
of the heavy lifting.

00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:27.390
Was there another question?

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:34.330
So that first
homework was certainly

00:50:34.330 --> 00:50:35.930
very general intentionally.

00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:40.610
Because I'm hoping you
will read the book.

00:50:40.610 --> 00:50:46.820
The lecture, you'll be
able to match the lectures

00:50:46.820 --> 00:50:51.100
with the book even later
on when they separate

00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:54.004
a little or separate more.

00:50:54.004 --> 00:50:55.170
You'll see what we're doing.

00:50:55.170 --> 00:50:58.350
And those, the
homework problems,

00:50:58.350 --> 00:51:01.380
you should look at some
of the others just to see.

00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.860
Do I know how to do that?

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.810
Right.

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:08.010
Let's stop here for
this first review.

00:51:08.010 --> 00:51:10.620
I'm sure we'll have more--
questions will build up

00:51:10.620 --> 00:51:12.870
for the second week.

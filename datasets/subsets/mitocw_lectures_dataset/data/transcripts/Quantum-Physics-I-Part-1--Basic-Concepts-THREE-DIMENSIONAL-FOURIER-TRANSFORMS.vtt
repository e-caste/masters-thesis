00:00:00.872 --> 00:00:05.570
PROFESSOR: We got here
finally in terms of position

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:07.920
and in terms of momentum.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.650
So this was not an accident that
it worked for position and wave

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.530
number.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.240
It works with position
and for momentum.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.950
And remember, this phi of
p now has interpretation

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:28.070
of the weight that is associated
with a plane wave of momentum

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.610
p, and you're summing
over P in here.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.990
So we'll do the natural
thing that we did with x.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:44.460
We'll interpret
phi of p squared--

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.990
phi of p squared--

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:55.050
dp is the probability.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:25.160
Find the particle with momentum
in the range p, p plus dp.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:31.880
Just the same way as we would
say that psi squared of x, dx

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.020
is the probability to find
the particle between x and x

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.910
plus dx.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:46.460
So this is allowed now by the
conservation of probability

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.290
and this, therefore,
makes sense.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.390
It's a postulate, though.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.210
It's not something
that can derive.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.720
I can just argue that
it's consistent to think

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:04.360
in that way, and that's
the way we finally

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:13.850
promote this phi of p,
which did encode psi of x.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.790
Phi of b has the
same information

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.870
as phi of x. phi of p is the
weight of the superposition

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.780
but, finally, it's given a
probabilistic interpretation.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.250
It represents a probability
to find the particle

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:31.645
with some momentum.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.550
So this is what is going to
allow us to do expectation

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:41.880
values in a minute.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.300
But I want to close
off this discussion

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:48.200
by writing for you the
three-dimensional versions

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.920
of these equations.

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.390
3D version of Fourier transform.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.350
So this is what we
want to rewrite.

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.740
So what would it be?

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.140
It's psi of the vector x.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.570
Since you're going to
have three integrals--

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.880
because you're going into
it over three components

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.610
of momentum-- this factor
appears three times.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:20.600
So actually, it's 2 pi h bar
to the three halfs integral phi

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:29.940
of vector p into the i vector
p dot product vector x h

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:42.410
bar d cube p, and phi of p
vector the inverse theorem--

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.720
same factor, we keep the nice
symmetry between x and p--

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:57.130
psi of x vector negative
exponent same dot product

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:02.930
but negative exponent d cube x.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.350
So these are the three
dimensional versions

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.850
of your x versus p.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:24.460
And there is a three-dimensional
version of Parseval.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.390
So oh there's a three
dimensional version

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.790
of the delta function.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.880
Just like we had a
delta function here--

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.020
a delta function in
three dimensional space

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.950
would be delta cubed
x minus x prime would

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:57.270
be one over 2 pi cubed
integral d cube k e to the i k

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.600
vector x minus x prime vector.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.290
It's all quite analogous.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:11.040
I think you should appreciate
that you don't have to memorize

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.840
them or anything like that.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.030
They won't be in
any formula sheet,

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.270
but they are very
analogous expressions.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.580
Parseval also works
in the same way.

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.090
And you have-- just
as you would imagine--

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.670
that the integral all over
three dimensional space of psi

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:38.640
of x squared is equal to
the integral over three

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:48.140
dimensional momentum
space of phi of p squared.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.130
So the three results--

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.650
the Fourier theorem the
delta function and Parseval

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.936
hold equally well.

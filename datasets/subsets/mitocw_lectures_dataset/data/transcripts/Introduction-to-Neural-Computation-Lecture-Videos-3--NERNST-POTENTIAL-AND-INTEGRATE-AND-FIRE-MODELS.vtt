WEBVTT

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.524
MICHALE FEE: Good
morning, everybody.

00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:20.970
So we're going to
continue today developing

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.080
our model of a neuron.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.420
Again, this is called the
"Equivalent Circuit Model,"

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.570
and it was developed by Alan
Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.100
in the '40s and '50s.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.390
Let me just give a brief
recap of what we've covered

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.710
in the last couple of lectures.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.030
So we've been
analyzing a neuron.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.840
We've been imagining an
experiment in which we

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.220
have a neuron in a dish filled
with extracellular solution,

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.560
which is a salt solution.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.380
We have an electrode
in the cell that's

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.470
measuring the voltage
difference between the inside

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.890
and the outside of the cell.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.879
So we have the
electrode connected

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.820
to an amplifier, a differential
amplifier, and a wire

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.400
in the bath connected to the
other side of the differential

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.330
amplifier.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.300
And we have a
current source, which

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.100
injects current into the cell.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.410
And we imagine that,
as the experimenter,

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.260
we have our hand
on a knob that we

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.510
can adjust the amount
of current that's

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:25.400
being injected into the cell.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.040
We've described the
neuron basically

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.010
as a capacitor,
because it has a--

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.600
it's two conductors
separated by an insulator.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.660
So we have a conductor, one
conductor inside the cell,

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.070
which is that conductive
intracellular salt solution,

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.500
and another conductor
outside the cell, which

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.480
is the conductive
extracellular solution.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.240
And those two
conductors are separated

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.910
by an insulator, which is
a phospholipid bilayer.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.680
We wrote down the
equivalent circuit

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.550
for this, which for this
situation right here

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.320
it has a voltage measuring
device that represents

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.990
the membrane potential
as the difference

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.389
between the intracellular
voltage and the extracellular

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:09.370
voltage.

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.920
We have a current
source here, and we've

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.190
represented our neuron
so far as a capacitor.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.790
We then introduce the idea of
ion channels, or conductances,

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.520
or pores in the
membrane that allow

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.010
ions to pass through
the membrane,

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:28.660
through these little pores.

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.780
And we described the
idea that there are--

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.280
we talked about the idea that
there are many different kinds

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.340
of ions, ion channels, that
have different interesting

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.520
properties.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.680
So we then extended our
analysis of our neuron

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.540
in the dish to include
these ion channels.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.790
We began by putting--

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.480
by representing ion
channels as a resistance

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.700
that connects the
intracellular space.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.340
In the extracellular
space, this resistor

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.050
is in parallel
with our capacitor.

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.750
And we represented
the current going

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.020
through that
resistance, which we

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.000
called the "leak
resistance," R sub

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.620
L. We represented the current
as "leak current," I sub L.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.280
We noted that we were
going to model this leak

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.980
resistance using Ohm's law.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.950
So we wrote down
that current, that

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.380
leak current, as the
membrane potential, V,

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.440
divided by the leak resistance.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.180
So this is just Ohm's law.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.900
And we also rewrote
the quantity 1

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:43.520
over R, 1 over the resistance,
as the leak conductance.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.420
So the leak current is
just the leak conductance

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.710
times the membrane potential.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:53.610
And we also introduced the
idea of an I-V curve, which

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.150
plots the amount
of current flowing

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.380
through our leak conductance
here as a function

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.130
of the membrane
potential, this V.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.940
And for the case of a resistor,
for the case where we're

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.440
modeling our leak
conductance with Ohm's law,

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.350
the current, as a
function of voltage,

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.620
is a straight line going through
the origin, whose slope is just

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.664
the leak conductance.

00:04:22.664 --> 00:04:23.980
Any questions about that?

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.040
Then we derived
a simple equation

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.470
for how the membrane potential
evolves over time as a function

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:37.360
of the injected current.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.300
And we did that using
Kirchhoff's current law, which

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.590
says that the sum of all
the currents into a node

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.560
has to equal the sum of
currents out of a node,

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.780
where a node here means a wire.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.010
And so the sum of these
occurrences equal to 0.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:56.980
There's a minus sign here,
because this current,

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.060
the electrode injected current,
is defined as positive going

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.830
into the cell,
and these currents

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:06.700
are defined as positive when
they go out of the cell.

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.390
We substituted for
the leak current,

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.000
the expression from Ohm's law.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.230
So into this part of the
equation here, this term,

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:20.290
we substitute VM
over R sub L. And I

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.320
apologize for the slight
inconsistency in notation here.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.900
Sometimes I'm using
VM, and sometimes I'm

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:32.560
using V. I'll try to
fix that, but those--

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.510
VM is the same as V in
what you've seen so far.

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.420
And we also have
an expression here

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:42.320
for the capacitive current.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.760
The capacitive current
through this capacitor

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.770
is just C, dV, dt.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:51.000
So we put those two expressions,
make those two substitutions,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.020
and we have this expression that
relates the voltage in the cell

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.420
to the injected current.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.940
We rewrote this a little
bit by multiplying through

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.630
by the leak resistance, and
we rewrote this again making

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:08.180
a couple substitutions.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.740
We use tau in place of RC.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.660
So that becomes a time constant.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.440
And the infinity is this
expression on the right--

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.210
R leak times the
injected current.

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.780
So the equation
that we now have,

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.430
the differential
equation that we now

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:28.520
have, for the dependence of
the membrane potential on

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.410
injected current
looks like this--

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:35.250
V plus tau, dV, dt, is
equal to V infinity.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.370
When we inject
current into the cell,

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:41.360
we're changing the infinity.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.920
And then the voltage
evolves, as described

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.195
by this differential equation.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:57.380
So we're going to plot a
bunch of things, the infinity

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.910
and the voltage in the cell, as
we inject a pulse of current.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.740
So we start out with
injected current equal to 0.

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.060
We step up to I naught, hold
a constant injected current I

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:15.170
naught for some period of time,
and then reset the current back

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:16.190
to 0.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.310
So what does V infinity do as
a function of time, anybody?

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.381
What does that mean?

00:07:25.381 --> 00:07:27.640
AUDIENCE: It does
the same things.

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.390
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.320
It does the same thing,
but multiplied by R sub L--

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.400
very good.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.060
And what does the
membrane potential do?

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.670
So let's start the
membrane potential at 0.

00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:42.320
So starting here, what does
the membrane potential do

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.250
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:47.000
Yes?

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:47.908
What's your name?

00:07:47.908 --> 00:07:48.366
AUDIENCE: I'm Kate.

00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:49.116
MICHALE FEE: Kate.

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.200
Yes, stays at 0.

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:59.700
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:00.690
How do we say--

00:08:00.690 --> 00:08:01.680
how do we say it?

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.080
Exponentially toward
V infinity, very good.

00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:07.560
So it relaxes exponentially
toward infinity, which is here.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.520
And then what happens?

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.842
AUDIENCE: And then
it [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:11.842 --> 00:08:12.800
MICHALE FEE: Very good.

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.150
And it does-- it relaxes
with a time constant of RC.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:18.860
And what that means
is that the time

00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.720
it takes for it to relax to 1
over e of its original distance

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.230
from V infinity is given by tau.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:34.750
Very good-- and you can solve
this differential equation

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:38.590
that was on the previous
slide for periods

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:41.020
where the injected
current is constant,

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.980
where V infinity is constant.

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.300
And what you can see is
that the voltage difference

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:53.310
from the current V infinity
relaxes exponentially to 0.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:57.580
It starts out at the initial
voltage minus V infinity,

00:08:57.580 --> 00:09:00.790
and you multiply that difference
times an exponential that

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:02.140
decays to 0.

00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:04.600
And so the voltage difference
between the voltage and V

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.590
infinity decreases.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:12.580
So now we then
introduce the idea

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:14.890
that neurons have batteries.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.330
Where do the
batteries of a neuron

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.310
come from, anybody remember?

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.615
Stacey, I remember you.

00:09:19.615 --> 00:09:21.490
Where do the batteries
of a neuron come from?

00:09:26.924 --> 00:09:27.630
Good.

00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.690
That's what the
battery produces.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:32.770
The battery produces
a voltage difference.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.710
But biophysically, what causes
that voltage difference?

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:39.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.630
MICHALE FEE: Good,
ion selective pores.

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.400
Good, that's one
component, and there's

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.470
another important component.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:47.080
Somebody else want to answer?

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.400
AUDIENCE: Ion concentration.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.608
MICHALE FEE: Good, excellent.

00:09:49.608 --> 00:09:52.570
So we have two components--
ion concentration gradients

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:55.090
and ions selective pores.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:00.340
So basically, if you have a
high concentration of potassium

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:05.110
inside the cell, when you open
up a potassium selective ion

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:09.550
channel, the potassium ions
diffuse out of the cell,

00:10:09.550 --> 00:10:13.000
leaving an excess
of negative charges

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.570
inside the cell that causes
the voltage inside the cell

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:21.500
to go down until there's
a sufficient voltage

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:25.370
gradient that the drift
of potassium ions back

00:10:25.370 --> 00:10:28.040
into the cell driven
by the voltage gradient

00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:31.280
is equal to the
diffusion rate of ions

00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:38.750
out of the cell produced by
the concentration gradient.

00:10:38.750 --> 00:10:41.730
At equilibrium, at the
equilibrium potential,

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:44.490
there's a particular
voltage at which

00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:47.150
there is no net current into--

00:10:47.150 --> 00:10:50.390
potassium current into
or out of the cell.

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:53.510
And that's what we mean
by equilibrium potential,

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.450
otherwise known as the
"Nernst potential."

00:10:56.450 --> 00:10:59.090
Last time we derived
the Nernst potential

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:00.305
using the Boltzmann equation.

00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.270
The Boltzmann equation
gives us the ratio

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.330
of the probability of finding
an ion inside or outside

00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:13.010
of the cell, and that's equal
to e to the minus energy

00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:15.920
difference of an ion inside
and outside of the cell divided

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.030
by KT.

00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:20.150
The energy difference
is given by the charge

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.880
times the voltage difference,
the charge of the ion

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.060
that we're considering times
the voltage difference.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.510
So we took the log of both
sides, solved for V in minus V

00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.360
out, and we found that
the voltage difference

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.230
at equilibrium.

00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:35.360
This is at thermal equilibrium.

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.370
That's what the Boltzmann
equation tells us--

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:38.900
at thermal equilibrium.

00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:41.600
What's the ratio
of probabilities?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.720
At thermal equilibrium,
the voltage difference

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.990
is 25,000 millivolts times
the log, the natural log,

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:53.510
of the ratio of
concentrations, and that's

00:11:53.510 --> 00:11:59.420
E sub K. If you plug-in the
potassium concentrations here,

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.630
that gives you the equilibrium
potential for potassium

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:05.032
or the Nernst potential
for potassium.

00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:12.710
So real neurons
here on Earth are

00:12:12.710 --> 00:12:15.560
kind of like caesium
neurons on that--

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:19.070
cesium ions on
that alien planet.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.980
The potassium concentration
inside of a cell

00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:24.050
is around 400
millimolar, and I think

00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:30.060
this is for squid giant axon,
which is a little bit alien.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:30.560
Yes?

00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:30.860
Go ahead.

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.760
AUDIENCE: From the
previous [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:39.110
MICHALE FEE: Yep.

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:42.140
So if you think
about the probability

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:47.660
of finding a potassium
ion inside of a cell

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.340
and finding a potassium
ion outside of the cell,

00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:52.700
the ratio of
probabilities is going

00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:55.635
to be proportional to the
ratio of concentrations.

00:12:55.635 --> 00:12:56.510
Does that make sense?

00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:05.400
So given these concentrations,
a high concentration

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.640
of positive potassium
ions inside the cell,

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:11.190
a low concentration
outside the cell,

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:14.250
we can take the ratio
of those concentrations,

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:15.750
take the natural log of that.

00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:20.190
That's about 3 log units.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:25.380
The sign is negative, because
this ratio is smaller than 1.

00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.710
So the equilibrium
potential for potassium

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:35.730
is about 25 millivolts, KT
over Q for a monovalent iron

00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:38.130
is 25 millivolts.

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:43.290
So the Nernst potential is
25 millivolts times minus 3.

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:47.105
So the equilibrium
potential is about minus 75.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:57.560
So let's now look at a
different ion, sodium.

00:13:57.560 --> 00:14:00.850
So sodium has a very
low concentration inside

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.610
of a cell compared to outside.

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:08.520
That ratio is about
a factor of 10.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:14.410
The natural log of 10 is
about 2 log units, right?

00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:17.050
So what's the
equilibrium potential

00:14:17.050 --> 00:14:21.340
for sodium, anybody has a guess?

00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.720
[LAUGHS]

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.490
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:25.490 --> 00:14:26.440
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.400
Plus or minus?

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:28.460
AUDIENCE: Oh, plus.

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:29.210
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:14:29.210 --> 00:14:33.110
So it's about 2 log units
times 25 millivolts, right?

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:37.220
So it's plus 50 or so.

00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.288
Good.

00:14:38.288 --> 00:14:39.080
How about chloride?

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:40.038
So this is interesting.

00:14:40.038 --> 00:14:42.850
Chloride is a negative ion.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:45.490
It has a high concentration
outside the cell

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:47.750
and a low concentration
inside the cell.

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:51.430
So when we open up a
chloride channel, what

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.470
happens to the chloride ions?

00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.560
Which way do they go, into
the cell or out of the cell?

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.000
Good.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:01.840
They're negative.

00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.710
So what is that going to do to
the voltage inside the cell?

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:09.820
We're negative, good.

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.920
And the ratio of concentrations
here is about 10.

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.020
So log of 10.

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:18.130
It's 2-ish.

00:15:18.130 --> 00:15:22.260
So what's that Nernst
potential going to be?

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.780
About minus 50, exactly.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:28.500
If you plug-in the actual
numbers, it's minus 60.

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:29.530
Great.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:30.030
Good.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.410
Here's an interesting
one-- calcium.

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.650
Calcium is kept at an
extremely low concentration

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:41.190
inside of cells, because it's
used as a signaling molecule.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:43.590
When calcium comes into
a cell, it actually

00:15:43.590 --> 00:15:46.650
does things important.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.660
So the cell buffers calcium.

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.930
It sequesters calcium into
the endoplasmic reticulum

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:55.410
and keeps the concentration
in the cytoplasm very low.

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:59.060
The concentration outside
the cell is about 2.

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.510
The ratio is a
pretty big number.

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:06.810
So if you--

00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:07.310
OK.

00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:12.440
Why is the coefficient
here, KT over Q,

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:15.600
why is that 12 millivolts
here instead of 25?

00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:21.550
Excellent.

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:25.720
So it's KT over 2 times
the electron charge.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.250
So that's 12
millivolts, very good.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.160
And so the equilibrium potential
for calcium is very positive.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:34.670
Great.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.630
Any questions about that?

00:16:36.630 --> 00:16:42.510
So these are the
most important ions

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:45.840
that we have to think about
in terms of ionic conductances

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.670
across the membrane.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:53.060
Any questions?

00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:55.460
Good.

00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:59.030
So let's go back to
our neuron in the dish,

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:02.750
and we're going to consider
a neuron that has a potassium

00:17:02.750 --> 00:17:08.010
conductance and a high potassium
concentration inside the cell.

00:17:08.010 --> 00:17:10.819
Remember, we can write
down the magnitude

00:17:10.819 --> 00:17:13.849
of that conductance
as G sub K. And now

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:15.359
we're going to do an experiment.

00:17:15.359 --> 00:17:18.140
We're going to
measure the voltage

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:20.869
in our cell, the steady
state voltage in our cell,

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:23.810
as a function of the
amount of current that

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:27.650
is either being injected or
passing through the membrane--

00:17:27.650 --> 00:17:28.580
its steady state.

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.510
Those two things are the same.

00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:35.400
So we're going to plot
the potassium current

00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.260
through the membrane
as a function

00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:40.710
of the voltage of the cell.

00:17:40.710 --> 00:17:45.190
So let's say that
we inject 0 current.

00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:49.384
What's the steady state voltage
in the cell going to be,

00:17:49.384 --> 00:17:50.338
anybody?

00:17:58.940 --> 00:18:00.080
We just went through this.

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.300
Uh-oh, I have to--

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:07.910
oh, OK.

00:18:07.910 --> 00:18:09.150
I have a volunteer back here.

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.430
Why 25 millivolts?

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:17.530
And we will assume
the channel is open.

00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:21.360
So what is the--

00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:23.861
so your answer is that the--

00:18:23.861 --> 00:18:28.310
if you inject 0
current, the voltage

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:30.610
is going to be the Nernst
potential for potassium.

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:36.100
And that is correct, but
what is the actual number?

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:36.600
Good.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.020
It's going to be around
negative 75 millivolts.

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:44.580
So if we inject 0 current, we
know a voltage of our neuron

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:49.960
is going to be around EK
or minus 75 millivolts.

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:54.860
Now, let's start injecting
current into the cell

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:59.150
until the voltage gets to 0.

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.760
Now, are we going
to be injecting

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.190
positive current into this
cell or negative current?

00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:07.490
What do we have to do, inject
positive or negative current

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:09.650
to make the voltage get up to 0?

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:15.070
Positive, right, because the
voltage inside is negative.

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:17.230
So we need to inject
positive charges.

00:19:17.230 --> 00:19:19.930
And how much current
do we need to inject?

00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:22.990
If the conductance is
g, how much current

00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:25.562
do we need to inject?

00:19:25.562 --> 00:19:26.062
What?

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:34.750
V is the voltage inside of our
cell, so you're getting there.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:35.760
You're really close.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:36.510
What's the answer?

00:19:40.250 --> 00:19:43.610
A times G. So we're going
to inject the current

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:46.880
into our cell until
the voltage gets to 0.

00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.890
And if we inject different
amounts of current

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:51.920
into the cell and measure
what the voltage is,

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.810
we get kind of a straight line.

00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:00.940
So for a potassium
conductance, if you

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:05.870
hold the voltage positive above
the equilibrium potential,

00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:09.940
potassium ions are going to
flow out through the membrane.

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:11.350
Is that clear?

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:16.820
Let's hold the voltage at 0.

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:18.580
Which way are our ions flowing?

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:22.260
So the ions are going
to be flowing out.

00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:25.990
To hold the voltage
at EK, what happens

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.765
to the potassium current?

00:20:28.765 --> 00:20:32.060
It goes to 0, because you're
now at the Nernst potential.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:39.900
And if you hold the voltage
below, the inside of the cell

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:43.150
is now negative relative
to the Nernst potential,

00:20:43.150 --> 00:20:44.960
and current's going to flow in.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:46.540
So notice that the
current actually

00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:51.080
reverses sine around EK.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:54.640
And so sometimes this voltage
is called the "reversal

00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:55.840
potential."

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.540
So you'll hear me sometimes
refer to the reversal

00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:01.990
potential, and that's just the
same as the Nernst potential

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.231
or the equilibrium potential.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.700
So the equation
for something that

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:13.240
looks like this, a straight
line that's offset from 0,

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.140
is just this.

00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.680
So this expression
right here is going

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.710
to be our basic model
for how we describe

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.740
the current through an
ion channel as a function

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:25.360
of the voltage of the membrane.

00:21:25.360 --> 00:21:27.610
So current, the
potassium current,

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.370
is just the
potassium conductance

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.790
times the difference of
the membrane potential

00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:36.760
from the reversal potential.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.680
So IK equals GK
times V minus EK.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.940
We also have a circuit, a little
simple equivalent circuit,

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.960
that describes this relation,
and this is what it looks like.

00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:54.610
We have a-- what
we're going to do

00:21:54.610 --> 00:22:05.740
to include the effects of
this ion-specific conductance

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:08.140
in the presence of a
concentration gradient

00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:12.010
is to take our conductor, our
resistor here, our conductance,

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.830
and put it in series
with a battery.

00:22:14.830 --> 00:22:16.720
So that's the basic
circuit element

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.320
that describes this
kind of I-V relation.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:21.920
Why is that?

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.135
So let's break this
down a little bit.

00:22:24.135 --> 00:22:25.510
Basically, what
we're going to do

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:29.750
is we're going to equate this
membrane potential difference

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.040
between the inside and
the outside of the cell,

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.650
this potential difference, to
the sum of the voltage drops

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:38.070
across these two elements.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:42.930
Is it 1.5 volts, the same
as the battery in here?

00:22:42.930 --> 00:22:43.640
No.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.140
What is it?

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:47.635
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:47.635 --> 00:22:48.343
MICHALE FEE: Yes.

00:22:48.343 --> 00:22:50.640
That's the battery we've
been talking about, exactly.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.020
So the voltage drop
across this battery is EK.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:59.130
What's the voltage drop across
this resistor, this potassium

00:22:59.130 --> 00:23:01.920
conductance?

00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:03.930
What does it depend on?

00:23:03.930 --> 00:23:05.490
What if the current is 0?

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:10.500
What's the voltage drop across
a resistor whose current is 0?

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.070
0.

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.720
Ohm's law, right?

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.960
What is it at arbitrary current?

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:19.380
What's the voltage
drop across a resistor

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.124
as a function of current?

00:23:21.124 --> 00:23:22.007
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:22.007 --> 00:23:22.757
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:23:22.757 --> 00:23:25.600
Can somebody tell me what it
is in terms of the quantities

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:26.170
that we have?

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:31.080
We're looking for a
delta V across here.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.310
So VM, the membrane
potential, has

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:40.880
to just equal the sum of those
two voltage drops, right?

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.360
So VM equals EK plus IK over GK.

00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.505
And now let's just
solve this for IK.

00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:52.440
So that's why this little
circuit element describes

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.640
our potassium conductance.

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:57.956
That's the equation
that goes with it.

00:23:57.956 --> 00:23:59.227
Any questions?

00:24:02.636 --> 00:24:03.610
No?

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:05.170
All right, let's push on.

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:08.450
This quantity right here,
by the way, V minus EK,

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.660
is called the driving potential.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:15.642
If V is equal to EK, then
the driving potential is 0,

00:24:15.642 --> 00:24:16.600
and there's no current.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.880
The current through the channel
is proportional to the driving

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:26.480
potential.

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:35.130
So let's just-- so
there is our new circuit

00:24:35.130 --> 00:24:40.530
diagram for our cell that's a
capacitor whose membrane has

00:24:40.530 --> 00:24:42.600
little leaks in
it, where there's

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:50.430
a ion-specific permeability of
the pore and ion concentration

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:53.190
gradient to produce a battery.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.820
There's our new circuit element.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:56.820
You can see that we're
getting awfully close now

00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.755
to the whole equivalent
circuit model that Hodgkin

00:25:01.755 --> 00:25:05.160
and Huxley wrote down.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:10.080
So let's just flesh
out this equation here.

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:12.240
What is I sub K?

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:19.730
I sub K is just times
V minus EK, very good.

00:25:19.730 --> 00:25:24.110
Remember that the resistance,
RK is just 1 over GK,

00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:28.100
and tau, again, is
RK times C. So let's

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.180
massage this a little bit more.

00:25:30.180 --> 00:25:36.020
We're going to write
this down as V plus dV,

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:40.955
dt equals EK plus RKIE.

00:25:40.955 --> 00:25:43.140
So what is that?

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.780
Any guess what that is?

00:25:48.182 --> 00:25:49.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:50.118
MICHALE FEE: Very good.

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:56.280
Can everyone see why
that's V infinity?

00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:00.210
Because if you set
dV, dt equal to 0,

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.825
V is equal to IK plus RKIE.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.590
If you inject a constant
current at steady state,

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.490
dV, dt equals 0, you can see
that the injected current

00:26:15.490 --> 00:26:18.820
is just equal to the
potassium current

00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:21.490
leaking out through
the membrane.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:23.090
That all makes great sense.

00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:24.640
So that's V infinity.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.710
The voltage is just--

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.580
the differential equation
is V plus tau dV,

00:26:29.580 --> 00:26:31.090
dt equals V infinity.

00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:34.100
It's exactly the same
equation we had before.

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.710
So you know that at every moment
V is going to be doing what?

00:26:41.880 --> 00:26:48.690
Everybody together-- relaxing
toward V infinity, right?

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:51.710
Where that's our new V infinity.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:54.890
So we're going to do the
same experiment again.

00:26:54.890 --> 00:26:57.030
Here is our pulse
of injected current.

00:26:57.030 --> 00:27:00.870
V infinity is now
starting at EK,

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:05.460
jumps up to EK plus RKI naught
and then goes back down.

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:10.446
And the voltage of the cell
is relaxing toward V infinity.

00:27:16.770 --> 00:27:22.840
So adding that just shifted
this voltage trace down from 0.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.300
Remember, before this
was sitting at 0,

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:28.130
and now it's sitting
at minus 75 millivolts.

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:35.985
Any questions?

00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:53.486
So we're going to
come back in a minute

00:27:53.486 --> 00:28:01.290
and finish fleshing
out this model where

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.890
we make those conductances
is dependent on time

00:28:04.890 --> 00:28:10.090
as a way of describing the
spikes that a neuron produces.

00:28:10.090 --> 00:28:11.770
But before we do
that, we're going

00:28:11.770 --> 00:28:15.790
to talk about a much
simpler model of how

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:18.810
a spiking neuron behaves.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.680
Basically, what we're going
to do is we're going to

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:28.050
instead of write down a detailed
biophysical model of action

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:30.660
potentials, which is
where we're heading,

00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.710
we're just going to ask some
simpler questions about how

00:28:34.710 --> 00:28:37.120
a spiking neuron behaves.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:42.030
So notice that action
potentials are really important.

00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.430
They're the way neurons
communicate with other neurons.

00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:47.910
They send a signal down their
axon, release neurotransmitter

00:28:47.910 --> 00:28:49.410
on other neurons.

00:28:49.410 --> 00:28:53.052
But most of the time a
neuron is not spiking.

00:28:53.052 --> 00:28:53.760
What is it doing?

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:04.230
Well, could be.

00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:08.060
Other thoughts?

00:29:08.060 --> 00:29:09.955
Certainly sometimes
it could be resting.

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:13.660
Right.

00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:15.310
Well, and how does it do that?

00:29:20.612 --> 00:29:21.576
[LAUGHS]

00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:24.262
It's part of it.

00:29:24.262 --> 00:29:25.640
Anybody?

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:28.360
Yes?

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.590
Integrating its inputs, and
it integrates those inputs,

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:35.550
and eventually it spikes.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:38.490
So we're going to
develop a model

00:29:38.490 --> 00:29:42.900
or look at a model now called,
not surprisingly, "integrate

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.160
and fire," that captures
exactly that idea.

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:51.720
That a neuron spends most of
its time integrating its inputs,

00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:53.550
making a decision
about when to spike,

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.130
and then spiking, and
then starting over again.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:01.890
So the other crucial
piece of this

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:04.750
is that for most
types of neurons

00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:07.690
the spikes are
really all the same.

00:30:07.690 --> 00:30:11.280
The details of the
spike wave form

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.520
don't carry extra
information beyond the fact

00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:15.820
that there's a spike.

00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:19.320
We're going to treat our
spikes as delta functions, just

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.370
discrete events
at a single time,

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:27.210
and the spikes
are going to occur

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:30.150
when the voltage in
the neuron reaches

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:34.350
a particular membrane potential,
called the "spike threshold."

00:30:34.350 --> 00:30:38.480
Now, that's a reasonable
approximation for many neurons.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.120
It's not absolutely the
case, but many neurons

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:46.160
spike when the neuron reaches
a particular voltage threshold.

00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:51.515
And that's captured in this
model called the integrate

00:30:51.515 --> 00:30:52.250
and fire neuron.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:53.708
And what we're
going to do is we're

00:30:53.708 --> 00:30:55.880
going to take our
Hodgkin-Huxley model,

00:30:55.880 --> 00:31:01.310
and we're going to replace
these sodium and potassium

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:04.110
conductances that actually
generate the spike.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:06.260
We're going to replace
that with a very simplified

00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:11.160
model of a spike generator, and
it's going to look like this.

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:16.880
So basically, the idea is
that the cell gets input

00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:22.380
from either an electrode
or from a synaptic input,

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:25.500
and it integrates that input
until it reaches a voltage,

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.870
called V threshold.

00:31:28.870 --> 00:31:31.800
And once it reaches a
threshold, we simply

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:37.110
reset the voltage back down to
a lower value, called "V reset."

00:31:37.110 --> 00:31:39.750
And then we just--

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:42.840
if we want to, we can just
draw a line at that time,

00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:43.860
and that's the spike.

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.840
But what really happens
to the voltage here

00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.690
is that once the voltage
hits V threshold,

00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:57.190
it gets reset back down
to this [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:57.190 --> 00:31:58.386
Any questions?

00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.855
Now, that kind of
behavior is not--

00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:09.300
it's fairly common in neurons.

00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:14.360
So this is an example of, does
the voltage in a cell in motor

00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.980
cortex of the
songbird-- and this

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:20.420
is from a paper from Rich
Mooney's lab back in 1992.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:22.530
And you can see that
if you inject current,

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:25.580
the voltage in this cell ramps
up until it hits a threshold

00:32:25.580 --> 00:32:27.050
voltage.

00:32:27.050 --> 00:32:29.720
It makes a spike, which is
very narrow in time, but then

00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.740
the voltage resets down
to a lower voltage.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:36.790
And that process just
repeats over and over.

00:32:41.110 --> 00:32:43.050
So now what we're
going to do is we're

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:48.210
going to calculate the rate
at which a neuron fires

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:51.150
as a function of how
much current gets

00:32:51.150 --> 00:32:56.490
injected into the cell,
how much input a cell gets.

00:32:56.490 --> 00:32:58.320
So we're going to
start by considering

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:01.800
the case where the cell has
no leaks in its membrane,

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.720
no conductances.

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.120
So let's plot voltage
as a function of time,

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.420
so this is voltage as
a function of time,

00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.990
when we inject a step of
current into the cell.

00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:14.500
So what's going to happen?

00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:17.220
So the cell starts
at some voltage,

00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:19.130
and the current turns on.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.430
What's going to happen?

00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:25.224
Some fresh [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:31.450
Yes?

00:33:31.450 --> 00:33:36.882
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:36.882 --> 00:33:37.840
MICHALE FEE: Excellent.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.840
Like that?

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:39.432
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:33:39.432 --> 00:33:40.390
MICHALE FEE: Very good.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:41.557
Then what's going to happen?

00:33:44.818 --> 00:33:45.318
Yeah.

00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:51.750
Excellent-- like that.

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:55.505
And then what's going to happen?

00:33:55.505 --> 00:33:59.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.090
MICHALE FEE: So we inject a
constant current into our cell,

00:34:02.090 --> 00:34:04.940
and now our cell is
going to generate

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:10.880
spikes, action potentials,
at regular intervals.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.840
And the interval
between those spikes

00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:17.310
is going to be controlled by
how long it takes that capacitor

00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:22.389
to charge up from the reset
voltage to the threshold.

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:24.719
So we can actually just
very simply calculate

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:27.420
the firing rate of this
neuron as a function

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:32.040
of how much current we
inject into the cell.

00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:35.823
So the firing rate is
just 1 over that interval

00:34:35.823 --> 00:34:36.615
between the spikes.

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.360
So now what do we do?

00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.110
Anybody want to guess
what the next step is?

00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.610
How do we figure out
how long it takes?

00:34:57.610 --> 00:34:59.570
We know this distance.

00:34:59.570 --> 00:35:02.260
This is kind of like some
third grade word problem here.

00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.230
Come on, somebody help me out.

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.350
You cross a river.

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:10.030
You're paddling one second.

00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:11.770
The river's 10 meters across.

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:20.345
Anybody, anybody?

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:33.900
How about right there, white
shirt, what do you think?

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:34.400
Yes.

00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:35.394
[LAUGHS]

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.460
Well, we're trying
to calculate the time

00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.640
it takes for the voltage
to go from here to here.

00:35:56.830 --> 00:35:57.850
What would it depend on?

00:35:57.850 --> 00:35:58.350
Yes?

00:36:02.890 --> 00:36:03.390
Yeah.

00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:04.432
Well, what are you doing?

00:36:09.650 --> 00:36:11.150
Yeah, but what are you--

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:12.260
you're calculating what?

00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:13.523
AUDIENCE: Delta t.

00:36:13.523 --> 00:36:15.440
MICHALE FEE: Yeah, you're
calculating delta t.

00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.310
And you're using
what about this line?

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.660
Slope, exactly.

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.630
So if we knew the
slope of this line,

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:29.200
we could calculate how long it
takes to go from here to here.

00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:32.990
So let's do that.

00:36:32.990 --> 00:36:35.980
So we have this
equation, C, dV, dt

00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:38.650
equals I sub E. What's
the slope of this line?

00:36:44.446 --> 00:36:48.380
Yeah, it's just dV, dt.

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:49.210
Good.

00:36:49.210 --> 00:36:51.480
So it's dV, dt.

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.820
That's delta V over delta t.

00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:56.760
Delta V is just this
voltage difference, right?

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:59.970
And delta t is what we're
trying to calculate.

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.370
So we just solve--

00:37:01.370 --> 00:37:03.650
we just plug this
into here, and we just

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:07.470
solve for 1 over delta t.

00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:11.777
And that's just C delta V
times the injected current.

00:37:11.777 --> 00:37:13.610
That's probably what
you were saying, right?

00:37:18.518 --> 00:37:19.560
Any questions about that?

00:37:24.290 --> 00:37:25.880
So let's look at
what that looks like.

00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:30.470
The firing rate is proportional
to the projected current.

00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:31.760
It goes through 0.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.880
At 0 injected current,
the voltage is constant

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:37.220
and the neuron will never fire.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:39.260
But if we inject a
tiny bit of current,

00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:42.440
the voltage will slowly ramp
up, and it will eventually

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:45.010
hit the threshold
and then reset.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.990
So the firing rate is
proportional to the injected

00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:52.220
current slope 1 over C
delta V. If the capacitor

00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:54.980
is much bigger, what
happens to the firing rate?

00:37:58.350 --> 00:38:01.020
It slows down, because
as you inject current,

00:38:01.020 --> 00:38:04.350
the voltage increases more
slowly because the capacitance

00:38:04.350 --> 00:38:04.860
is bigger.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:14.770
Now, let's add our leak
conductance back in.

00:38:19.090 --> 00:38:21.460
So this leak
conductance, we're going

00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:26.282
to think of it as a
potassium conductance.

00:38:26.282 --> 00:38:28.730
So I'm going to call it
"G leak," because I'm

00:38:28.730 --> 00:38:32.870
going to use something like that
later in Hodgkin-Huxley model,

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:34.460
but you should
think about it just

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:36.290
as a potassium conductance.

00:38:39.230 --> 00:38:40.380
So what's going to happen?

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:43.370
Let's go to our plot of
voltage as a function of time

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.260
during our injected current.

00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:53.920
Let's say that we start at V
reset, our voltage at V reset.

00:38:59.510 --> 00:39:02.440
Or actually, let's
start it E leak.

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:06.950
Now what happens, anybody?

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:07.575
Yes?

00:39:07.575 --> 00:39:11.460
AUDIENCE: It
relaxes [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:12.690
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:39:12.690 --> 00:39:17.250
The voltage starts here, because
there's 0 injected current.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.740
As soon as you inject current,
V infinity jumps up to here,

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.760
let's say.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.890
The voltage relaxes
exponentially

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:30.110
toward V infinity until it
hits the threshold-- very good.

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:30.920
Then what happens?

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:31.730
Somebody else.

00:39:34.586 --> 00:39:37.450
Yeah?

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.121
How about you in the gray shirt.

00:39:39.121 --> 00:39:41.608
AUDIENCE: It drops.

00:39:41.608 --> 00:39:42.400
MICHALE FEE: Great.

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.670
So if you know the
answer, raise your hand.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.260
We'll go much faster.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:52.630
So at this point, it will
jump back down to where?

00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:53.350
Good.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:55.081
And then what.

00:39:55.081 --> 00:39:56.160
Anybody else?

00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:58.620
If you know the answer,
raise your hand.

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:00.570
Let's just do an exercise.

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:03.090
Raise your hand,
everybody who knows--

00:40:03.090 --> 00:40:03.645
up high.

00:40:03.645 --> 00:40:05.490
Raise your hand up high.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:09.860
Now, one of you say it.

00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:10.804
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:13.215
Everybody, say it.

00:40:13.215 --> 00:40:14.860
AUDIENCE: It's relaxes.

00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:17.600
MICHALE FEE: Great,
music to my ears.

00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:21.770
It relaxes exponentially
back V infinity

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:26.950
until it hits threshold
and it jumps back.

00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:27.860
It keeps doing it.

00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.360
Now, what happens here?

00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:30.650
The current turns off.

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:31.430
What happens?

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.500
Who knows the answer
to that question?

00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:35.350
Raise your hands up high.

00:40:35.350 --> 00:40:36.140
Shout it out.

00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.432
AUDIENCE: It goes back to the--

00:40:37.432 --> 00:40:38.330
AUDIENCE: It relaxes.

00:40:38.330 --> 00:40:39.288
MICHALE FEE: Excellent.

00:40:39.288 --> 00:40:40.780
It relaxes back to?

00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:45.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:50.865
MICHALE FEE: Why is it
a leak, not V reset?

00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:57.260
When there's no current
injected, that's V infinity.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:01.240
So that's why it
relaxes back to E leak.

00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:02.990
Any questions?

00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.490
No?

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:04.670
It's pretty simple, right?

00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.250
So it's pretty simple.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:11.650
And we can actually
derive the expression now

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.230
for this delta t,
and therefore, we

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.180
can drive the equation
for the firing rate

00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:18.550
as a function of
injected current.

00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:21.340
It's a little more complicated
than the other one.

00:41:21.340 --> 00:41:26.740
I'm going to go through it
in a little bit less detail,

00:41:26.740 --> 00:41:28.540
because the answer
turns out to actually

00:41:28.540 --> 00:41:30.220
be pretty simple [AUDIO OUT].

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:33.160
So we're going to calculate the
firing rate, which is just 1

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:35.380
over this delta t here.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.750
Before we actually
get into the math,

00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:42.140
what happens if v
infinity is down here?

00:41:42.140 --> 00:41:45.680
Who knows the answer
to that question?

00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:48.000
Raise your hands.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.460
Shout it out.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:52.340
It won't spike, right?

00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:52.840
Good.

00:41:55.830 --> 00:41:58.590
So V infinity actually has
to be above V threshold

00:41:58.590 --> 00:42:00.660
in order for that
neuron to spike.

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.210
Does that makes sense?

00:42:03.210 --> 00:42:05.010
So something is
different already,

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:09.180
because before we
found in the current

00:42:09.180 --> 00:42:12.270
we injected the cell
would eventually spike.

00:42:12.270 --> 00:42:15.130
But now what we see is
when we have a leak,

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:18.100
the V infinity actually has
to be above V threshold.

00:42:18.100 --> 00:42:20.310
And so that means there's
going to be some threshold

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:22.978
current below which
the neuron won't spike.

00:42:22.978 --> 00:42:23.770
That's pretty cool.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:25.810
We can see that right away.

00:42:25.810 --> 00:42:30.130
So I just wanted to
find one quantity,

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:34.690
called the "rheobase," and
that is that current at which

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:36.620
the neuron begins to spike.

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.140
So if we start our
cell at V reset,

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.150
because let's say
it just spiked,

00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:45.430
so it relaxes exponentially
toward V infinity,

00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:49.810
but let's say that V infinity
is right at threshold.

00:42:49.810 --> 00:42:52.930
So you can see that the
time to reach the threshold

00:42:52.930 --> 00:42:54.370
is actually very long.

00:42:54.370 --> 00:42:56.680
If V infinity is
equal to V threshold,

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:59.320
it will never actually reach it.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.300
Even when V infinity is
equal to V threshold,

00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.450
the firing rate is 0.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:06.670
Because if you inject just
a tiny bit more current,

00:43:06.670 --> 00:43:07.930
now it'll begin to spike.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.110
It can calculate
the injected current

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:14.430
required to reach threshold.

00:43:14.430 --> 00:43:15.900
That's called the rheobase.

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.022
We just set V infinity
equal to V threshold, right?

00:43:20.022 --> 00:43:22.460
And we use our equation for--

00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:26.960
that's V infinity, and we just
set it equal to threshold.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.140
Now we just derive
the injected current

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:30.880
we just solved for
I sub E. That's

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:35.650
the injected current
required to make V infinity

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.510
reach V threshold,
and you can see

00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:42.340
that it's just G leak times
V threshold minus E leak.

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.075
And we call that I threshold.

00:43:49.075 --> 00:43:50.200
So here's the way it looks.

00:43:50.200 --> 00:43:56.010
The firing rate of this
neuron is 0 for low currents.

00:43:56.010 --> 00:43:59.520
As you inject more current,
V infinity increases,

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.770
but the cell still
can't reach threshold

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:06.190
until you inject an
amount of current,

00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:08.680
such that V infinity
reaches V threshold,

00:44:08.680 --> 00:44:10.120
and then it begins to spike.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:15.620
And the firing rate increases
rapidly, and then going up.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.360
Does that makes sense?

00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:20.720
So many neurons
have that property

00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:25.850
of having a threshold current
above which you have to--

00:44:25.850 --> 00:44:27.560
below which the
cell won't spike.

00:44:31.730 --> 00:44:36.310
So now let's actually
derive the equation

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:42.910
for this firing rate as a
function of injected current.

00:44:42.910 --> 00:44:45.468
So here's how we're
going to do that.

00:44:45.468 --> 00:44:47.010
The cell just spiked,
and we're going

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:50.160
to calculate the amount of time
before the cell spikes again.

00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:53.040
So we're going to start
the voltage at V reset.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.940
We know that at some injected
current above threshold

00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.175
the cell relaxes
exponentially to V infinity.

00:44:59.175 --> 00:45:01.050
And we're just going to
calculate how long it

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:03.460
takes equal to threshold.

00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:05.770
So you know that that's
an exponential, right?

00:45:05.770 --> 00:45:08.350
In fact, we wrote down the
solution to that exponential

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:10.470
a bunch of times.

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:12.800
The difference from
V to V infinity

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.900
decreases exponentially.

00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.970
But we know a bunch of
these values, right?

00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:22.250
We know that we're calculating
these voltages when tau equals,

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:27.100
sorry, when t equals delta t.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.870
And we know the initial
voltage, that's V reset.

00:45:29.870 --> 00:45:34.430
And we know the voltage
at time delta t,

00:45:34.430 --> 00:45:36.120
and that's just
equal to V threshold.

00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:39.960
So we can just substitute those
quantities into this equation.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:44.750
So now we have V [AUDIO OUT]
minus V infinity equals V reset

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:48.070
minus V infinity times E to
the minus delta t over tau.

00:45:48.070 --> 00:45:49.610
Does that make sense?

00:45:49.610 --> 00:45:52.700
Everyone see what I just did?

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:56.470
We're just calculating this
time that it takes the neuron

00:45:56.470 --> 00:46:02.170
to relax exponentially from
V reset to V threshold.

00:46:02.170 --> 00:46:03.910
We know all these
quantities, so we just

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:05.290
stick them into this equation.

00:46:05.290 --> 00:46:06.370
And what do we solve for?

00:46:09.310 --> 00:46:12.040
Delta t, good.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:15.130
So we take the
natural log of-- well,

00:46:15.130 --> 00:46:17.950
we divide through
by V reset minus V

00:46:17.950 --> 00:46:22.120
infinity, take the natural
log, and we solve for delta t.

00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:26.950
So delta t equals minus tau,
natural log, V infinity minus V

00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:30.430
threshold over V
infinity minus V reset.

00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:32.770
It's kind of messy, right?

00:46:32.770 --> 00:46:34.330
I don't know.

00:46:34.330 --> 00:46:39.150
The shape of that doesn't
really leap to my mind.

00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:44.800
So what we're going
to do is actually just

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.040
simplify this
expression in a limit,

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.860
in a limit that the
injected current is large.

00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.180
So what happens here when the
injected current is large?

00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.260
What gets big?

00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.850
V infinity gets big, right?

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:02.290
When you inject
a lot of current,

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:04.532
V infinity is very high.

00:47:04.532 --> 00:47:06.615
Does that make sense?

00:47:06.615 --> 00:47:09.180
And when V infinity
is really big,

00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:11.400
this expression approaches what?

00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:16.030
1.

00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:17.820
And what is the log of 1?

00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:18.600
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:19.440
MICHALE FEE: 0.

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:23.820
So this expression, this
expression approaches 1,

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:28.170
and this expression, the
log of that, approaches 0.

00:47:28.170 --> 00:47:32.430
So we can do is do a linear
approximation of this turn

00:47:32.430 --> 00:47:33.530
right here.

00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:35.640
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.800
We're going to work in
the limit that V infinity

00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.800
is much bigger than V
reset or V threshold.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:45.600
We're going to use the
approximation that log

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:49.440
of 1 plus alpha is just alpha.

00:47:49.440 --> 00:47:54.490
So as this approaches 1, you
can write it as 1 plus alpha.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.570
That whole thing there
approximates to alpha.

00:47:57.570 --> 00:48:01.080
And when you do that and you
solve for the firing rate, what

00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:03.360
you find is that the
firing rate is just 1

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:07.170
over C delta V times
the injected current

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:09.820
minus the threshold current.

00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:12.340
Threshold current
is just the rheobase

00:48:12.340 --> 00:48:15.030
that we calculated before.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:16.420
Well, what does that look like?

00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:19.040
Well, what is the firing
rate, first of all?

00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:21.840
I kind of simplified this a bit.

00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:27.980
What is the firing rate when the
current is below I threshold?

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:28.850
0.

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:31.550
And then if it's above I
threshold-- so this expression

00:48:31.550 --> 00:48:33.890
that I wrote right
here is true only

00:48:33.890 --> 00:48:36.980
if the injected current
greater than I threshold.

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.430
And it's zero below that.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:41.186
So now, what does
this look like?

00:48:41.186 --> 00:48:44.290
The firing rate is 0
until you hit threshold.

00:48:44.290 --> 00:48:45.870
And then what?

00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:46.708
It increases--

00:48:46.708 --> 00:48:47.500
AUDIENCE: Linearly.

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.750
MICHALE FEE: --linearly.

00:48:50.750 --> 00:48:55.210
So this equation is linearly
in the injected current.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:58.900
The slope is actually exactly
the same as it was for the case

00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:02.520
where there was no leak.

00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:04.530
So the fine rate is 0.

00:49:04.530 --> 00:49:10.180
Once you hit the threshold,
the firing rate of the neuron

00:49:10.180 --> 00:49:16.330
increases approximately
linearly for large currents.

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:20.470
And if you look down here, what
you see is that the current

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:21.400
actually--

00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.830
the actual solution is
that the firing rate

00:49:23.830 --> 00:49:28.290
jumps up at threshold
and then tracks

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.390
along the linear approximation.

00:49:30.390 --> 00:49:33.870
So the dashed line there
is the actual solution.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:37.620
The solid line is that
linear approximation.

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:41.310
And that right there is
really a very good model

00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:42.285
for a lot of neurons.

00:49:46.170 --> 00:49:50.255
Most neurons sort of
saturate a little bit.

00:49:50.255 --> 00:49:52.380
Their firing rate kind of
flattens out a little bit

00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.060
as you go to very
high firing rates.

00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:56.210
But that's a pretty
good approximation.

00:49:56.210 --> 00:49:57.050
Yes?

00:49:57.050 --> 00:49:59.690
AUDIENCE: What's [INAUDIBLE]?

00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:04.040
MICHALE FEE: Delta
V is the difference

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:08.970
from V reset to V threshold.

00:50:08.970 --> 00:50:11.850
Those are just
parameters of the model.

00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:13.280
There was another question here.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:13.535
Skyler?

00:50:13.535 --> 00:50:14.370
AUDIENCE: I had
the same question.

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:15.020
MICHALE FEE: Same question?

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:15.520
OK.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:21.060
Anything else?

00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:27.560
That's the integrate
and fire neuron.

00:50:27.560 --> 00:50:32.060
That's probably the
most commonly used model

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:35.880
of neurons in neuroscience--

00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:36.480
pretty simple.

00:50:40.553 --> 00:50:42.720
Or I should say, that's the
most commonly used model

00:50:42.720 --> 00:50:45.230
of spiking neurons.

00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:49.960
So you can actually take
neurons that behave like this,

00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.070
and assemble them
into complex networks,

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:57.640
and study how network
interactions occur

00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.080
with a spiking model.

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:04.990
And this model captures most
of the interesting, important

00:51:04.990 --> 00:51:07.150
behavior of spiking neurons.

00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.260
Question, Danny?

00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:18.780
Any other questions?

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:30.960
So let's come back to
our Hodgkin-Huxley model,

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.340
our equivalent circuit.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:37.000
So what we just described
was a model neuron

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.750
in which we replaced
these sodium and potassium

00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:43.150
conductances that actually
produce these action

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:47.775
potentials with a very
simple spike generator.

00:51:47.775 --> 00:51:49.150
But now what we're
going to do is

00:51:49.150 --> 00:51:50.960
we're going to come
back to our model,

00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:55.120
and we're going to flesh out
the biophysical details that

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:59.650
allow these two conductances
right here to produce

00:51:59.650 --> 00:52:01.870
action potentials.

00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:08.480
Now, in fact, most
of the time when

00:52:08.480 --> 00:52:12.410
we model networks of neurons,
we simplify the spike generator

00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:16.640
to something like an integrate
and fire spike generator.

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:19.730
But the framework that
Hodgkin and Huxley developed

00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:24.890
for describing a time-dependent
and voltage-dependent

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:29.600
conductances is so
powerful and commonly used

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:34.250
to describe conductances that
it's really worth understanding

00:52:34.250 --> 00:52:38.690
that mathematical description,
that physical description,

00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:42.680
of ionic conductances
and how they

00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:44.937
depend on voltage and time.

00:52:44.937 --> 00:52:46.520
So that's what we're
going to do next.

00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:51.290
So the first thing
we do is we notice

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:56.930
that in the Hodgkin-Huxley model
we have three conductances.

00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:00.140
We have conductance
which is very

00:53:00.140 --> 00:53:03.890
much like the lead
conductance that we just

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.530
used in the integrate
and fire model.

00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:11.990
It has a reversal potential
of around minus 50 millivolts,

00:53:11.990 --> 00:53:14.150
and it's just always on.

00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:16.780
It's just constant conductance.

00:53:16.780 --> 00:53:19.330
We have these two other
conductances, a sodium

00:53:19.330 --> 00:53:22.000
conductance and a
potassium conductance,

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:26.280
that are both time-dependent
and voltage-dependent.

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:27.750
Each one of those
conductances as

00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:30.300
has a current
associated with it,

00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:33.900
currents flowing
through ion channels.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:36.398
The total membrane
current is just the sum

00:53:36.398 --> 00:53:37.440
of all of those currents.

00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:40.780
That's just definition.

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.010
The total ionic
membrane current is just

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:48.180
the sum of contributions from
sodium channels, potassium

00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:49.770
channels, and a leak.

00:53:53.594 --> 00:53:56.850
So the equation for our
Hodgkin-Huxley model,

00:53:56.850 --> 00:53:58.900
again using Kirchhoff's
current law,

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:02.470
the sum of all the currents
into these nodes has equal 0.

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:05.560
So the membrane ionic current
plus the capacitive current

00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.470
equals the injected
electrode current.

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:13.670
Now, each one of
these conductances,

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:17.490
or each one of these
currents, can be written down

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:20.790
in the same form that
we developed before

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:22.890
for our potassium conductance.

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:27.600
It's just a, sorry, for
the potassium current.

00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.320
So the sodium current is just a
sodium conductance times what?

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.040
What is that?

00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:36.150
Driving potential, right?

00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:38.940
The driving
potential for sodium.

00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:44.250
But the sodium conductance now
is voltage- and time-dependent.

00:54:44.250 --> 00:54:46.560
And it's that voltage
and time dependence

00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:53.690
that gives sodium channels
the properties that they need

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:55.880
to generate action potentials.

00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:59.750
It's just analogous to
what we already did before

00:54:59.750 --> 00:55:02.360
for the potassium conductance.

00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.430
And here's the
potassium current.

00:55:04.430 --> 00:55:08.780
It's just GK times the driving
potential for potassium,

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:13.430
and the potassium conductance
is voltage- and time-dependent.

00:55:13.430 --> 00:55:18.490
Again, EK is minus
75, ENA is plus 55.

00:55:18.490 --> 00:55:21.640
And our leak conductance,
the leaked current rather,

00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.610
is just the leak conductance
times the driving potential

00:55:24.610 --> 00:55:27.770
for the leak current.

00:55:27.770 --> 00:55:30.240
The difference is
that, in this model

00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.180
now, the leak conductance
is just constant.

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:34.520
There's no time dependence,
it's always there,

00:55:34.520 --> 00:55:38.458
and its voltage independent.

00:55:38.458 --> 00:55:39.500
Any questions about that?

00:55:44.350 --> 00:55:46.650
So the name of the game
here in understanding

00:55:46.650 --> 00:55:51.090
how this thing works
is to figure out

00:55:51.090 --> 00:55:55.016
where this time dependence and
voltage dependence comes from.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:03.514
What's that?

00:56:03.514 --> 00:56:07.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:07.390 --> 00:56:09.130
MICHALE FEE: They're very close.

00:56:09.130 --> 00:56:13.570
The potassium equilibrium
potential is always very close

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:14.770
to minus 75.

00:56:14.770 --> 00:56:18.980
In some neurons, it might
be as low as minus 95,

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:21.180
but it's always in that range.

00:56:21.180 --> 00:56:25.710
The sodium reversal potential
is always plus 50-ish.

00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:35.070
Well, it's highly
consistent across mammals,

00:56:35.070 --> 00:56:41.630
and the numbers for squid are
pretty close to that as well.

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:45.070
I think these are the
numbers for squid that

00:56:45.070 --> 00:56:46.705
come from Hodgkin and Huxley.

00:56:49.894 --> 00:56:50.852
Questions?

00:56:56.121 --> 00:57:03.148
Now, how do these things
generate an action potential?

00:57:03.148 --> 00:57:04.190
That's the next question.

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:06.380
Just in principle,
how do you think

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:11.910
about conductances like this
generating action potentials?

00:57:11.910 --> 00:57:16.680
So let's say that the
conductances here are 0.

00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.080
We set those to 0.

00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:22.920
Those little arrows mean
variable or adjustable.

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:26.550
So we can imagine that we
have our hand on the knob,

00:57:26.550 --> 00:57:29.430
and let's just turn
those both down to 0.

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:32.060
So what's the voltage
in the cell going to be?

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:33.190
So what does the cell do?

00:57:37.138 --> 00:57:38.930
Well, if this is one
of those moments where

00:57:38.930 --> 00:57:41.388
everybody knows the answer and
they're just not saying it--

00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:45.390
anybody?

00:57:45.390 --> 00:57:46.290
Skylar?

00:57:46.290 --> 00:57:52.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:52.390 --> 00:57:53.140
MICHALE FEE: Good.

00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:58.840
So roughly, it's close to that.

00:57:58.840 --> 00:58:00.890
It's minus 50, in this case.

00:58:00.890 --> 00:58:01.390
Good.

00:58:01.390 --> 00:58:06.660
So if these conductances
are 0, then the cell

00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:10.140
is going to be sitting at
the vault of this battery.

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:13.680
There's 0 current,
steady state, 0 current.

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:17.170
The voltage drop across here is
0, because there is 0 current.

00:58:17.170 --> 00:58:19.050
And so the inside of
the cell had better

00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:21.720
be sitting at that voltage
of that battery, which

00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:24.630
is minus 50.

00:58:24.630 --> 00:58:29.540
So now, what happens if we
suddenly turn on a conductance?

00:58:29.540 --> 00:58:31.790
What do I mean by "turn
on a conductance"?

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:34.470
We make the resistance
really small,

00:58:34.470 --> 00:58:37.430
or we make the
conductance really big.

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:38.520
So what are we doing?

00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:42.000
Let's turn that conductance
on as much as possible,

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:46.010
which means we're setting
that resistor to 0.

00:58:46.010 --> 00:58:50.240
Actually, if this
resistance is 0,

00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.460
then the voltage drop across--

00:58:55.850 --> 00:58:59.570
the voltage inside
has to just be--

00:59:02.580 --> 00:59:05.795
it has to be set to the
voltage of that battery.

00:59:05.795 --> 00:59:06.670
Does that make sense?

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:15.590
Well, if we have no
conductance here,

00:59:15.590 --> 00:59:22.760
then the voltage inside the
cell will relax toward e sub l.

00:59:22.760 --> 00:59:25.480
But if we now turn
on this conductance,

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:29.770
we set that resistor
to 0, the voltage

00:59:29.770 --> 00:59:35.698
will jump up that resistor
back up to some big value.

00:59:35.698 --> 00:59:36.990
What's the voltage going to do?

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.710
Relax back to e sub l.

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:45.650
So Daniel made this nice
simulation of what happens.

00:59:45.650 --> 00:59:48.320
So here's what is
going to happen.

00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.470
These conductances are
going to start at 0.

00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:55.200
We're going to-- oh, wait.

00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:57.480
These conductances
are to start at 0,

00:59:57.480 --> 01:00:00.720
and then we're going to
make this resistor small--

01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:03.450
not 0, but small.

01:00:03.450 --> 01:00:05.580
Then we're going to
make this resistor big,

01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:08.960
and we're going to make
that resistor small.

01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:11.960
So watch what happens.

01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:15.260
So the conductances are going
to be plotted along the bottom,

01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.210
and the voltage of
the cell is going

01:00:17.210 --> 01:00:20.480
to be plotted as a
function of time here.

01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:24.980
And the green and red show
the reversal potentials

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:27.662
for the sodium and potassium.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.020
There, the sodium conductance
just got turned on.

01:00:37.020 --> 01:00:38.330
And what happened?

01:00:38.330 --> 01:00:42.330
The voltage of the cell
jumps up to [INAUDIBLE] when

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:45.690
we turn on the
potassium conductance,

01:00:45.690 --> 01:00:47.700
and we turn off the
sodium conductance,

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:51.360
and the voltage gets
dragged down to EK.

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.520
Then when we turn off the
potassium conductance,

01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.580
the voltage relaxes
back up to [INAUDIBLE]..

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:03.590
So look, conductances
are just knobs

01:01:03.590 --> 01:01:05.900
that allow the cell to
control its voltage--

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.240
an anthropomorphic
way to put it.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.080
You can control the
voltage of the cell

01:01:16.080 --> 01:01:21.440
just by setting the
values of those resistors.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:25.970
If you make this resistor really
small and that resistor big,

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:29.900
the voltage jumps up
toward [INAUDIBLE]..

01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:30.420
Why is that?

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:32.420
Because you're connecting
the inside of the cell

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.310
to that battery.

01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:38.670
Turn that off, and then
turn on this conductance,

01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:41.270
or setting that resistor
to be very small,

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:43.530
now you're connecting
the inside of your cell

01:01:43.530 --> 01:01:47.280
to this battery, which
is negative, down here.

01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.010
So you can just control the
voltage of the cell up and down

01:01:50.010 --> 01:01:51.765
just by twiddling these knobs.

01:01:54.370 --> 01:01:56.350
Another way to think
about it is this.

01:01:56.350 --> 01:02:02.810
If this resistor is big,
and if you set that resistor

01:02:02.810 --> 01:02:08.810
to be really small, then
the voltage here dominates.

01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:18.150
So over the timescale of any
process that we're considering

01:02:18.150 --> 01:02:21.300
here, the ionic concentrations
inside the cell and outside

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.566
of the cell don't change.

01:02:24.566 --> 01:02:27.036
Does that make sense?

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:32.260
Yes?

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.620
AUDIENCE: So if we
set both of them?

01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:36.590
MICHALE FEE: So you
set both of these to 0?

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:37.257
AUDIENCE: Not 0.

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:38.810
[INAUDIBLE]

01:02:38.810 --> 01:02:39.560
MICHALE FEE: Yeah.

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.252
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:40.252 --> 01:02:42.230
MICHALE FEE: If the
conductance is really high,

01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:44.390
that means setting the
resistors really small.

01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:45.140
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:46.682
MICHALE FEE: That's
a great question.

01:02:46.682 --> 01:02:47.580
What happens?

01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:48.725
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:48.725 --> 01:02:49.600
MICHALE FEE: Exactly.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:50.680
AUDIENCE: Isn't that like--

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:52.097
MICHALE FEE: That's
exactly right.

01:02:52.097 --> 01:02:53.800
If you set both of
these, if you turn

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:56.080
on both of these
conductances, then the voltage

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:58.480
goes somewhere in the middle.

01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:04.060
And the voltage that it
goes to is actually--

01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:05.170
you have to [AUDIO OUT].

01:03:05.170 --> 01:03:09.970
The Nernst potential
that we calculated

01:03:09.970 --> 01:03:14.530
is calculated only for the
case where you have one ion.

01:03:14.530 --> 01:03:16.960
If you want to calculate the
equilibrium potential when

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:20.530
you have multiple
pores open, then

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:25.210
you have to use a different
method of calculating.

01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:27.790
You have to actually
calculate the currents flowing

01:03:27.790 --> 01:03:31.780
in each one of those
channels, and based

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.880
on the permeabilities
of the channels,

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:37.030
and you get a
different expression,

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:42.470
called the
Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation.

01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:44.470
But the bottom line
is, if you open up

01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:47.783
both of those conductances,
it's somewhere in the middle.

01:03:47.783 --> 01:03:49.700
And if you want to get
the exact right answer,

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.250
you have to use
the GHK equation.

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:55.010
Yes?

01:03:55.010 --> 01:04:01.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.370
MICHALE FEE: Almost.

01:04:02.370 --> 01:04:03.610
We're not quite there yet.

01:04:03.610 --> 01:04:07.020
We're going to get there.

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:09.080
But you can see
what happens here

01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.440
is that these conductances are
actually voltage-dependent.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.220
So for example, the
sodium conductance

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:18.680
turns on at higher voltages.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:21.740
When this conductance
starts getting bigger,

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.320
what happens to the
voltage in the cell?

01:04:24.320 --> 01:04:26.120
It starts going up, right?

01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.130
But if this is
voltage-dependent and it

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:30.020
turns on at a
higher voltage, what

01:04:30.020 --> 01:04:32.900
happens to the conductance?

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.700
When the voltage gets
a little bit bigger,

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:38.780
what happens to the conductance,
which does what to the voltage?

01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:41.810
Makes it go up
even faster, right?

01:04:41.810 --> 01:04:43.580
And so you get this
runaway process

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:48.230
where the disconductance
turns on very quickly

01:04:48.230 --> 01:04:49.420
and the voltage jumps up.

01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:54.560
That's the essence of
the action potential.

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.540
But the essential
picture that I wanted

01:04:56.540 --> 01:05:03.590
you to get from this slide
is that these are just knobs.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:05.750
And when you turn
the knobs, you can

01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:08.810
change the volt-- that controls
the voltage in the cell.

01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:14.660
Each one of these
is causing the cell

01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:19.310
to be dragged toward
its reversal potential.

01:05:19.310 --> 01:05:25.310
So if this conductance is
big, this conductance is big,

01:05:25.310 --> 01:05:28.470
the voltage in the cell
gets dragged toward ENA.

01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:30.940
If the conductance is big,
the voltage in the cell

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:32.262
gets dragged toward EK.

01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:45.520
And next time, we're going
to go through the process.

01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.110
We're going to
describe the process

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:50.830
to drive the voltage
dependence of those ion

01:05:50.830 --> 01:05:53.770
channels, the sodium and
potassium ion channels,

01:05:53.770 --> 01:05:56.530
to derive the voltage dependence
and the time dependence that

01:05:56.530 --> 01:06:02.470
explains how you get this
action potential in a neuron.

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:05.190
So that's next Tuesday.

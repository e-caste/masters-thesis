00:00:27.342 --> 00:00:29.050
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: That
is the point here.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.300
This is not a heavy math
derivation kind of thing.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.610
This is not-- we
are not going to go

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.070
into great mathematical
detail in quantum mechanics.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.560
Now, we will show
some equations,

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.060
we'll work with
equations, because I

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.352
want you to know what they are.

00:00:44.352 --> 00:00:46.240
You got to know
what's under the hood.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.910
But we're not going to go
into sort of gory detail

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.580
in solving complex
quantum problems on paper.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.730
That's where the tools help
lift you away from that.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.480
And it also is kind of the
flavor of this class, which

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.030
is that this is about practice.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.970
This is about learning
the basic concepts,

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.610
and then applying them to
real problems and materials.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.600
And my enjoyment is in
energy, so the problems

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.255
we'll do in this part are going
to be energy-related problems.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.182
How many of you have
had quantum mechanics?

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:24.640
I wouldn't have
expected that many.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.980
How many of you have never seen
quantum mechanics in any form?

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.480
Raise your hands,
because it's good.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.350
It's good.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.640
We're going to start-- we're
going to do quantum mechanics--

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.920
we're going to do a couple
lectures here-- oh, this

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.003
is what we're going to do.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.438
That's our outline for the
class, for the second half.

00:01:45.438 --> 00:01:47.230
And you can see that
what we're going to do

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.510
is we're going to
kind of gently learn

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.250
the key aspects of
quantum mechanics

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.950
that I'd like you to
know for the modeling

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.320
that we're going
to do of materials.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.600
And then we're going
to actually apply it.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.012
We're going to stop right
here in the derivations,

00:02:01.012 --> 00:02:02.470
in the theory, and
then we're going

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.428
to start applying that
to real energy problems.

00:02:04.428 --> 00:02:06.520
So then we're going
to do two lectures

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.940
on how to apply what we just
learned to two different energy

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:11.410
topics.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.660
One, solar thermal fuels.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.830
Very cool and exciting material.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.800
And another, hydrogen storage.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.200
Also very cool and exciting.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.930
Then we're going to turn to
how you go from modeling atoms

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.270
to modeling solids
with quantum mechanics,

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.520
where different things happen.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.340
How many of you have
heard of a band structure?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.570
Yeah.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.190
Now, how many of you can tell
me, from the band structure,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.700
why silicon solar cells
are too expensive?

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.090
Now, you will be able to
tell me that right here.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:43.800
We're going to know.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.540
And that's a really
exciting thing,

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.820
because it's all in
the band structure.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.110
That answer is all in
the band structure.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.330
So many properties of materials
come out of these basic quantum

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.560
mechanical property
maps that you get.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.490
So that's what we're
going to do here.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.150
And then we'll go more
general and do applications

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.390
in nanotechnology
and more broadly.

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.300
How many of you have heard
of quantum confinement?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.620
That's down here.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.180
Do you know what it is?

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:13.460
Somebody tell me what it is.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.610
Yeah.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.193
AUDIENCE: So--

00:03:15.193 --> 00:03:16.318
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Oh, yeah.

00:03:16.318 --> 00:03:17.387
AUDIENCE: What is it?

00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:19.220
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
yeah, let's hear it.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.010
AUDIENCE: So what is it?

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.560
So you have the [? key, ?]
[? and that ?] [? holds ?]

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.210
electrons, stuff like that,
and they both [INAUDIBLE] take

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:29.290
a small section, it's so
small that it emits different

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.790
colors--

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:30.290
I mean, I don't know.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:31.170
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.045
That's exactly right.

00:03:32.045 --> 00:03:33.810
Now, but why?

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:36.330
You have electrons and holes,
which are just positive

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.010
and negative charges, right?

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.150
You talked about that.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.290
And then you make it small,
and it emits a different color

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.250
light.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.708
What emits a
different color light?

00:03:46.708 --> 00:03:47.625
AUDIENCE: Quantum dot.

00:03:47.625 --> 00:03:49.560
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Quantum dot, for example.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.460
Now, why?

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.630
Can anybody tell me why?

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.240
AUDIENCE: The [? sides ?] all
emit from a certain wavelength?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.150
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Why?

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.310
Changes the fundamental gap
of the material, but why?

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.080
It's something called
quantum confinement.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.710
Actually, it's nothing more
than what those two words say.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.220
Quantum confinement is the
squeezing of quantum things.

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.100
And in this case,
our quantum things

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.880
are positive and
negative charges.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.899
Right?

00:04:19.899 --> 00:04:23.448
And it turns out, when
you make an expectation,

00:04:23.448 --> 00:04:25.240
the positive and negative
charge like to be

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.630
kind of close to each other.

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:28.840
They don't like to
go away, necessarily.

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.510
Sometimes they
like to stay close.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.610
But they don't like
to get too close.

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.010
So if you make the material
smaller than the closeness

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.720
they like to get,
then they're squeezed.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:38.590
They're confined.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.430
And when you confine
quantum things,

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.560
you get interesting effects.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.370
That's why I can take something
that, say, ordinarily looks

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.470
like this, and take
a small piece of it,

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.600
and all of a sudden,
it turns blue.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.250
Like, how cool is that?

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.650
You changed the color
just by changing the size.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.150
That's quantum confinement.

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.400
That's something
that has everything

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.590
to do with quantum mechanics.

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.260
Right?

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.370
Electrons and holes, positive
and negative charges.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.220
You're not going to get that--

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:09.945
you're not getting
that over here.

00:05:09.945 --> 00:05:11.220
Mm-mm.

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.608
That's part one.

00:05:12.608 --> 00:05:14.400
Now we're going to go
to quantum mechanics.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.650
Because you can't simulate
electrons and holes

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.020
in part one, but now you can.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.430
Well, you will be able to.

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.930
And we're going to
actually-- you're

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.900
going to be able to tell me
what color a quantum dot could

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.620
be just by solving these
equations on a computer.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.500
Because now we're going to
capture quantum mechanics

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.450
and apply it to things
like nanotechnology.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.550
OK, so that's just
kind of a flavor

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.610
of where we're going to go.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.710
Any questions?

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.690
Mm-hmm.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.973
It's a quantum world.

00:05:46.973 --> 00:05:48.390
That's where we're
going to start.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:51.540
And the reason I put this is
because you can do Shakespeare

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.267
very quickly.

00:05:52.267 --> 00:05:54.600
There are people who have
been doing it for a long time.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.060
"Reducing expectations
for over 20 years."

00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:59.203
I just like that quote.

00:05:59.203 --> 00:06:01.620
There is something called the
Reduced Shakespeare Company.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:03.495
And that's what I'm
going to try to do today.

00:06:03.495 --> 00:06:06.510
We're going to go through the
basics of quantum mechanics

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.790
in one lecture that's
not really meant

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:11.130
to teach you too much
about quantum mechanics,

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.450
or go too much into depth.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.990
Again, I want to go through
some of the key aspects,

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.030
but really to get
a sense for it,

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.940
not to go into great
mathematical depth.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.290
That's what you take
a quantum course for.

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.390
OK?

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:26.100
But I need you to
understand some

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:28.230
of the key aspects of
quantum before we embark

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:32.300
on modeling quantum mechanics.

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:37.320
And so I want to start
with why, and why did we

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:38.940
even need this theory?

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:41.260
And so we'll talk a
little bit about that.

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.710
And then we'll talk about
some of the key aspects, which

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.320
is this wave-particle duality.

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.828
And then this is it right here.

00:06:49.828 --> 00:06:51.370
That's the equation
we're going to be

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:54.460
solving for all of part two.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:55.960
The Schrodinger equation.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.270
Has anybody seen the
Schrodinger equation?

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.290
Yeah, a little bit.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:05.215
Have any of you solved it
for [? A? ?] I saw a so-so.

00:07:05.215 --> 00:07:08.007
A little kind of like
you sort of solved it?

00:07:08.007 --> 00:07:08.840
What happened there?

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.595
AUDIENCE: I solved it,
but probably incorrectly.

00:07:10.595 --> 00:07:12.137
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
OK, I'll take that.

00:07:12.137 --> 00:07:12.655
That's good.

00:07:12.655 --> 00:07:14.780
And what else-- what other
problems have you solved

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.680
with the Schrodinger equation?

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:15.900
Yeah.

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:16.900
AUDIENCE: Hydrogen atom?

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:18.500
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Hydrogen atom, OK.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.897
That's where we'll end today.

00:07:20.897 --> 00:07:23.480
But still listen, because it's
going to be really interesting.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.100
Any other-- who else has solved
the Schrodinger equation?

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:26.600
Yeah.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:27.767
AUDIENCE: Particle in a box.

00:07:27.767 --> 00:07:29.354
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Particle in the box.

00:07:29.354 --> 00:07:30.562
AUDIENCE: Periodic potential?

00:07:30.562 --> 00:07:33.600
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Periodic potential.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.110
Any others?

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.350
Yeah.

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:35.517
AUDIENCE: Quantum tunneling.

00:07:35.517 --> 00:07:37.770
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Quantum tunneling, cool.

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:38.770
Anyone else solve it?

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:40.602
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:40.602 --> 00:07:42.060
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
That's what we're

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.428
going to do at the very end.

00:07:43.428 --> 00:07:44.470
That's the hydrogen atom.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.702
It's a harmonic potential.

00:07:46.702 --> 00:07:47.910
Somebody said something else?

00:07:49.918 --> 00:07:51.710
That's not quite a
harmonic potential, but.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:52.895
AUDIENCE: Cat in the box.

00:07:52.895 --> 00:07:54.770
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Any
other-- cat in the box!

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:58.250
I've got a cat in the
box today for you!

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.330
I put a cat in a box.

00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:04.940
The thing is, what's interesting
about all those examples

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.072
you all just said?

00:08:07.072 --> 00:08:08.530
AUDIENCE: They're
all [INAUDIBLE]..

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.488
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:08:09.488 --> 00:08:10.708
They're all kind of what?

00:08:10.708 --> 00:08:11.146
AUDIENCE: Simple.

00:08:11.146 --> 00:08:12.271
AUDIENCE: Exactly solvable.

00:08:12.271 --> 00:08:14.200
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Exactly
solvable and simple,

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:15.820
and therefore?

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.422
To someone in course three?

00:08:17.422 --> 00:08:18.130
AUDIENCE: Boring.

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.250
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Eh.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.760
Right?

00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.780
That's where we
have changed so much

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:28.820
in what we can do
because of computation.

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:34.340
So now, because of
the approximations

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.179
that you're going to learn in
the next couple of lectures,

00:08:37.179 --> 00:08:40.330
and the speed of
computers, we can actually

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:44.110
solve the Schrodinger equation
for realistic materials.

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:45.970
That's why we can
have this class.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:47.980
We would not be
having this class--

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:48.670
no.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.610
We wouldn't be having part
two of this class back

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:53.950
in the 1970s, 1980s.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:54.940
Oh, that reminds me.

00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:56.950
You should go to Berni Alder.

00:08:56.950 --> 00:08:59.350
Are all of you aware
of Berni Alder's talk?

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:03.430
He is really one of
the key foundations

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:07.330
of computational science in
this country and in the world.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:10.690
And he contributed to
some of the very first

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.120
molecular dynamic
simulations ever done.

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.440
And really helped-- and
that was in the 1950s.

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.870
So he's going to be a speaker.

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:17.858
Who can tell me when?

00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:18.650
AUDIENCE: Tomorrow.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.108
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Tomorrow at 4:00.

00:09:20.108 --> 00:09:22.440
Where?

00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:27.323
Somewhere on this campus, Berni
Alder will be speaking at 4:00.

00:09:27.323 --> 00:09:28.740
Please find him
and go if you can.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:34.367
He just really made some really
important key contributions

00:09:34.367 --> 00:09:35.950
to this field and
helped to launch it.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:38.010
It gave credibility.

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.940
He saw-- in molecular dynamics
simulations in the 1950s,

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:45.780
he could see really interesting
phenomena-- phase transitions

00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:46.800
happening in materials.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.560
Really helped to launch
the field of computation

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.570
in materials.

00:09:51.570 --> 00:09:53.160
OK, so let's go.

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.040
So here, you've seen this
picture in the first part.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:59.220
And you've also seen this.

00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.990
And, see, this is what?

00:10:00.990 --> 00:10:02.460
In part one, this is what?

00:10:05.196 --> 00:10:06.482
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:06.482 --> 00:10:07.440
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.720
Force field, Lennard-Jones.

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:12.810
And where do you get that?

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:14.340
Because you need it, right?

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.620
Can you do part
one without that?

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.140
Now, so where do you get it?

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:20.630
AUDIENCE: Quantum [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.370
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Well, you could.

00:10:22.370 --> 00:10:24.289
Or you could get it from where?

00:10:24.289 --> 00:10:25.164
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:25.164 --> 00:10:26.890
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Experiment.

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.770
But see, if I'm making new
materials that have never

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:33.713
been made, or if I'm making
materials where interactions

00:10:33.713 --> 00:10:36.130
are happening that I can't
really measure, because they're

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:39.130
really hard to measure, then
where could you get something

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:41.500
like this?

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.240
You can't do the experiment.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:46.640
That's where we can go
all the way down to here.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.030
And that's another place
where this whole realm

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.680
of quantum modeling is
going to be important.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.940
So that's where we are,
the bottom of the barrel.

00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:57.190
But not any less important.

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:04.430
This is just-- this has nothing
to do with quantum mechanics

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.190
at all, but I thought
it was pretty cool.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.260
Right?

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.360
This is just a
guy who has this--

00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.500
he's got a camera
pointing that way,

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.510
and then he's got a little
projector and a very

00:11:16.510 --> 00:11:18.730
specialized material
here, and he's

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:21.670
projecting the image
onto his jacket,

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.470
and so it looks like
he's transparent.

00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:28.220
But the point being that I
thought it was a cool idea,

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:28.720
I guess.

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:32.480
Sort of interesting.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:35.080
So you can see, the
car's sort of there,

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:37.010
but I don't think the
car's really there.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.150
Anyway, he needs to focus it.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:42.400
But weird things happen
in quantum mechanics.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.870
Really, really weird things.

00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.120
And it is a very quantum world.

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:50.230
If we understand those basic
particles like electrons,

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:53.910
then we can almost
understand everything.

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:55.830
Almost everything.

00:11:55.830 --> 00:11:57.600
Seriously.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.127
OK?

00:12:00.127 --> 00:12:01.710
So if you want to
know the properties,

00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.320
like mechanical
properties, and you

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.230
have a good potential
of this piece of iron,

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:10.230
for this piece of iron, you
can do classical mechanics.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:12.690
But if you want to understand
the mechanical properties,

00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:14.000
and you don't have
a good potential,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.450
well, you may need
quantum mechanics.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.117
And certainly, if you
want to understand

00:12:17.117 --> 00:12:21.850
the electrical properties,
or the optical properties,

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:25.570
can you do that with
classical potentials?

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:26.650
Tell me why.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.750
Why I can't get
electrical properties

00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:32.670
with classical potentials?

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:33.360
Yeah.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.880
AUDIENCE: Because you're
modeling the entire atoms.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.920
You're just basically
considering the nucleus

00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:39.360
and not really talking
about the electrons.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.443
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Exactly.

00:12:40.443 --> 00:12:43.262
And what do I need for
electrical properties?

00:12:43.262 --> 00:12:45.990
You got to know
about the electrons.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:47.560
Band structures!

00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:49.140
Band structures
will tell us about

00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.630
the electrical properties.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.280
You will learn to see--

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:54.870
it's like The Matrix.

00:12:54.870 --> 00:12:58.140
You will learn to read band
structures as whole cities

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.480
to explore that tell
you all about things

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.020
like this, and this.

00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:06.480
It's really powerful.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.250
And it tells you--
and so all we need

00:13:08.250 --> 00:13:10.680
to do is go down one
more scale, because this

00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.310
is where you've been, and
this is where we're going.

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.030
We're going here.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:21.190
Do electrons actually orbit?

00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:23.090
AUDIENCE: No.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:24.656
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
What do they do?

00:13:24.656 --> 00:13:26.450
AUDIENCE: Go around [INAUDIBLE]?

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:27.840
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
They go around?

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.090
AUDIENCE: No, they fly around.

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:30.507
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
They fly around?

00:13:30.507 --> 00:13:31.180
Sounds better.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.680
What?

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.670
AUDIENCE: They
have their orbitals

00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:34.410
that they can-- that there's
a possibility that they'll

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.065
[? be at. ?]

00:13:35.065 --> 00:13:36.260
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:36.980
Oh, yeah.

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.830
That's where we're going.

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.870
Why do we call them orbitals?

00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:43.370
Why do we call them orbitals?

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.120
We'll get to that.

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.920
Here's another motivation.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.220
And this is a great example
of what I was just talking

00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:53.320
about in that potential.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:57.010
If I have the right potential,
and I do my classical force

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.350
field calculations, I
can feel pretty golden

00:14:02.350 --> 00:14:05.500
about simulating the behavior of
materials, like how it cracks.

00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.660
Did you guys do
crack propagation?

00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:11.180
Ol' Professor Buehler
likes crack propagation.

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:13.150
There are not many
people on the planet

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.910
who more about crack propagation
than Professor Buehler.

00:14:15.910 --> 00:14:16.840
But look at this.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.090
I've cracked this piece
of-- what is this?

00:14:19.090 --> 00:14:21.280
Graphene, let's say.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:21.790
Silicon?

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:22.240
AUDIENCE: Silicon.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.110
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Oh, it's silicon.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.985
This is silicon just
looked at from the side.

00:14:24.985 --> 00:14:26.245
Yep, there they are, two.

00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:28.640
I've cracked this
piece of silicon.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:32.590
I guess I could have read
"silicon" there and known.

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:35.350
And I can't measure
it experimentally.

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:37.690
And so I crack it in the
computer with something called

00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:40.450
an EDIP potential that was
fit to certain experimental

00:14:40.450 --> 00:14:42.850
parameters, and then I
crack it in a computer

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:46.270
with a tight-binding model,
and look at the difference.

00:14:46.270 --> 00:14:47.620
Is that the same crack?

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:48.770
Is that the same property?

00:14:48.770 --> 00:14:50.150
Is it happening in the same way?

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.920
Absolutely not.

00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:52.510
It's completely different.

00:14:52.510 --> 00:14:55.480
Qualitatively, quantitatively,
the results you'll get

00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.850
and the findings you publish
will be totally different,

00:14:57.850 --> 00:14:59.870
depending on which
potential you choose.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:04.000
So that's really--
this is the reason why

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.460
we need these more
accurate-- a way, at least,

00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.900
to get more accurate potentials.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.210
And then you can get these
other properties, as I said.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:14.100
So you can get things like
where the electrons are.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.940
You can model things like
Raman spectra, which have

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:20.700
to do with electrons and light.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.570
You can model things
like reactions.

00:15:24.570 --> 00:15:29.310
Now, sometimes potentials--
like especially reacs.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.560
Did you run reacs potentials?

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:37.360
Reacs-- the name "reacs"
makes me think reaction.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.570
Does it make you think that?

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:41.170
So they're actually
modeled for reactions.

00:15:41.170 --> 00:15:42.950
And that means that
they can break bonds.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:45.735
However, there are
plenty of reactions--

00:15:45.735 --> 00:15:47.640
AUDIENCE: [SNEEZES]

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:50.700
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: --salute--
where reacs can actually not

00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:56.970
get the right physics, the right
structure of the potential.

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:57.690
Why?

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:59.340
Well, take a look at this one.

00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:03.760
This is butadiene plus
ethylene going to cyclohexane--

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.260
hexene.

00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:07.890
It's one of the simplest ways
you can actually make a ring.

00:16:07.890 --> 00:16:08.970
Watch those electrons.

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:14.860
Those are the electrons of
the part of the system that's

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:15.860
doing the reaction.

00:16:15.860 --> 00:16:17.260
That's where the electrons are.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:21.280
And where those electrons are
is what determines everything

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:27.107
about the reaction-- the
barrier, whether it happens.

00:16:27.107 --> 00:16:28.690
And let's see if I
can get it to play.

00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:29.920
And now, watch them.

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.430
Watch them.

00:16:30.430 --> 00:16:31.840
It's like balloon animals.

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.770
See, they pop up on the top,
and then they flow across.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.540
And then they do
a big shape-shift

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.110
as the reaction
actually happens,

00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:45.250
and they curve back around,
and they bubble up on top.

00:16:45.250 --> 00:16:49.030
And that's the final position
probability of those electrons.

00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:51.730
It's a very simple
reaction, but the behavior

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:54.730
is extremely complex.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:59.130
So when you fit a potential,
this is what you're ignoring.

00:16:59.130 --> 00:17:01.860
All of that complexity.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.050
And you're trying to fit
it to some functional form,

00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.700
and reacs has a whole lot
of degrees of freedom,

00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:09.329
so it actually can fit some
of this complexity very well.

00:17:09.329 --> 00:17:12.930
But that just gives you a
sense of the kind of thing

00:17:12.930 --> 00:17:17.640
that's happening, and why you
can miss important aspects

00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.670
with potentials.

00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:23.260
So in the Standard
Model, atoms are

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.420
made by these massive
point-like nuclei.

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:26.990
That's what you've been doing.

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:29.920
And now they're going to be
surrounded by these electrons.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.840
And you're going to
have core electrons,

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.140
and then you're going to have
the valence electrons, which

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:36.510
do all the work.

00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:38.260
They're the ones that
bind together and do

00:17:38.260 --> 00:17:40.510
all the interesting stuff.

00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:42.820
Somebody tell me, who
knows about the chemistry,

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:45.820
like s, p, d filling?

00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:47.500
Good.

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:51.632
Somebody tell me, how many
electrons are there in carbon?

00:17:51.632 --> 00:17:52.467
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:17:52.467 --> 00:17:53.050
AUDIENCE: Six.

00:17:53.050 --> 00:17:54.880
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Six.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.520
And how many are core
and how many are valence?

00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.522
What's what there?

00:17:59.522 --> 00:18:01.605
AUDIENCE: Two core, two
[? valence-- ?] four core,

00:18:01.605 --> 00:18:02.290
two valence.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:05.380
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK,
so it goes 1s, 2s.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:07.710
That's four.

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:11.400
2p, how many are in the 2p?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:13.110
Four, two?

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:14.280
How many?

00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.060
Two?

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.570
Like that, that's good.

00:18:16.570 --> 00:18:18.840
Now, what about silicon?

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.300
Which number is that?

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.340
Oh.

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.260
We really like materials--

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:29.210
material scientists
really like silicon.

00:18:29.210 --> 00:18:30.500
It's good material.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.490
14.

00:18:31.490 --> 00:18:33.455
How many electrons
are in the valence?

00:18:37.080 --> 00:18:39.690
Yeah, it's the same--
because in carbon--

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:41.670
you see, you had
the 2s and the 2p,

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.340
four electrons in the valence.

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.700
And in silicon, you've
got the 3s and the 3p,

00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:49.680
four electrons in the valence.

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.670
Right?

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.520
But you see, here's carbon.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.780
And here's 2p.

00:19:04.162 --> 00:19:05.120
And now here's silicon.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.920
This is 1s, 2s, 2p.

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.242
Is this making sense to people?

00:19:16.242 --> 00:19:17.700
How many of you
have not seen this?

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:19.170
It's OK.

00:19:19.170 --> 00:19:20.830
We'll talk a little
bit about this.

00:19:20.830 --> 00:19:26.090
So these are filled, filled,
and so on, up to here.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.590
And then you got these guys.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:31.310
And this is the valence,
and this is the valence.

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.920
Those are the electrons that
do all of the interacting.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.020
Those are the ones that
do the chemical bonding.

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.395
They're the ones
that we're going

00:19:37.395 --> 00:19:40.400
to care about in this class.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:45.110
We are not going to be working
with these core electrons.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:47.852
Those are core electrons.

00:19:47.852 --> 00:19:49.310
So we're going to
freeze those out,

00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:51.740
because they don't really
play much of a role

00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.380
in the kinds of properties we're
going to actually care about

00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:55.580
in this class, OK?

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.840
And I won't talk much
about how we do that.

00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:04.650
We do that with something called
pseudo potentials, which model

00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.170
the core part of the electron.

00:20:07.170 --> 00:20:09.360
So this part, we're
going to get rid of.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:13.050
Now, somebody tell
me why, in looking

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:18.450
at this, why we are made out
of carbon and not silicon?

00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:29.505
The valence electrons look
pretty similar, don't they?

00:20:29.505 --> 00:20:34.290
You got a couple of s and
a couple of p in each case.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.130
OK, higher.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.108
What does that mean?

00:20:41.108 --> 00:20:42.650
AUDIENCE: More
metallic [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.200
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: More metallic?

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.345
Maybe.

00:20:45.345 --> 00:20:47.418
[? Except so, ?]
because I'm metallic.

00:20:47.418 --> 00:20:48.507
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:48.507 --> 00:20:49.840
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: What was that?

00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.730
AUDIENCE: More reactive?

00:20:50.730 --> 00:20:52.000
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: More active?

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:55.520
Mm, not sure about that.

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.945
You could argue that if you
think about the alkalis,

00:20:57.945 --> 00:21:01.610
if you're thinking in
that way, that it wants

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.920
to lose these electrons more.

00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.520
Carbon can be a
very reactive atom.

00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.810
Actually, the bond in diamond
is considerably higher energy

00:21:11.810 --> 00:21:14.160
than the bond in silicon.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.535
So why are we made out of
carbon and not silicon?

00:21:16.535 --> 00:21:18.390
We'll come back to that.

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:19.410
Think about it.

00:21:19.410 --> 00:21:20.010
It's cheaper?

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.520
It's cost-efficient.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.620
Actually, nature is always
really good about that.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:30.210
Not quite the answer.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:30.900
It's real.

00:21:30.900 --> 00:21:34.740
These electrons that we're going
to be simulating, they exist!

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:37.890
They can be seen, and look
at that complex structure!

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:42.510
That's the complexity of a
bond measured in experiment.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.280
That's a real experimental bond.

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:46.440
And it shows where
that electron density

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.083
is in the bond, and look
at how complicated that is.

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:50.500
And that's what
I'm talking about.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:51.780
And we can calculate
that-- well, this

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.490
is a different material,
but you can see

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.290
a similar sort of complexity.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:58.080
We can calculate that complexity
with quantum mechanics.

00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.140
And you can see again
by looking at this--

00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.710
look at this.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:04.200
I mean, there's like a
ball underneath a donut

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.540
and a teardrop, and
a donut and a ball.

00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.270
Did your classical
potential get all of that?

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.990
No way.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.260
It's just averaging
over this, right?

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.490
And so once we go to trying
to calculate properties

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:22.580
of materials that are
this complex, electrons,

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:24.318
we really got to get it right.

00:22:24.318 --> 00:22:26.360
And that's what the
Schrodinger equation will do.

00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.730
So now, why is this important
to solve in the computer?

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:34.640
Well, it's sort of
the same reasons for--

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:37.100
these are the same
reasons for classical,

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.180
the first part of the class.

00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.330
It provides us with a
microscopic understanding.

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:42.980
It has predictive power.

00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.220
And in this case, we can really
say it's first-principles.

00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:49.010
And you hear this word
"first-principles--"

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:50.960
how many of you have
had "first-principles?"

00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:51.710
What does it mean?

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:56.205
Take a guess.

00:22:56.205 --> 00:22:58.320
AUDIENCE: From the basic--

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.288
just from basic axiom.

00:23:00.288 --> 00:23:01.830
You're not really
assuming very much.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.240
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Exactly.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.460
And in this case, what
are we going to assume?

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.680
What is the only input
into the simulation?

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.685
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:08.685 --> 00:23:10.560
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Well,
what's the only input

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.270
into the simulation
of that equation?

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:16.604
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: The atom what?

00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:18.356
AUDIENCE: Like the
atom that you're--

00:23:18.356 --> 00:23:20.150
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Yeah, which is what?

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:23.060
Just the atom.

00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.870
The atom number.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.130
And maybe its position.

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:26.210
That's important.

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.580
Like where the atom is.

00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:29.632
And the charge.

00:23:29.632 --> 00:23:30.590
The charge on the atom.

00:23:30.590 --> 00:23:32.450
Is it ionized, is it not.

00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:35.000
And that's it.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.060
Not really, ha, because we
have to make approximations.

00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:41.450
But ideally, that's all
we would need to put in

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:44.180
to solve first-principles.

00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:47.120
That is, to solve without
any other fits or inputs.

00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:49.160
Just the atom, which atom
is it, and where is it

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.180
is what you put in.

00:23:51.180 --> 00:23:54.840
And the challenges
we have is that this

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.510
is a much more
computationally-intensive kind

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:58.180
of simulation.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.590
So how long-- who was
saying that it was too long?

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:03.330
And then we'll have classical--

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:05.110
yeah, how long was it taken?

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.090
AUDIENCE: Six hours.

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:09.420
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Six
hours, and how many atoms?

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.320
AUDIENCE: One--

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.673
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: One atom?

00:24:11.673 --> 00:24:13.026
AUDIENCE: No, 150,000.

00:24:13.026 --> 00:24:14.280
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Oh, 150,000.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.750
OK, good.

00:24:15.750 --> 00:24:19.980
So if we tried to simulate
150,000 atoms, that's not even

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.060
a sentence I can start.

00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.610
Actually, in quantum
mechanics, you

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:24.220
can't even get close to that.

00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.840
So if you try to do 150
atoms in quantum mechanics,

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.610
it could easily
take you six hours,

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:33.095
and it could take
you even much more.

00:24:33.095 --> 00:24:34.470
Our goal in the
homeworks will be

00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:38.200
to make sure the simulations
take as long as possible.

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.237
I'm kidding.

00:24:39.237 --> 00:24:41.320
But we'll make sure that
they don't take too long.

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.883
But they're slow and painful,
and you will feel that pain.

00:24:43.883 --> 00:24:45.550
Not because we're
going to make problems

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:47.380
where you have to
simulate for a long time,

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.870
but because you'll just see.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.140
You'll be like, wait a second,
I only got two atoms in here.

00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:54.940
Why does this take an hour?

00:24:54.940 --> 00:24:57.715
Well, it's because even
with all the approximations

00:24:57.715 --> 00:25:00.070
and the computer
speed, it just takes

00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:01.870
longer to do these
kinds of calculations

00:25:01.870 --> 00:25:04.000
that are more complex.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.170
OK?

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:09.030
How many people know where the
fastest computer in the world

00:25:09.030 --> 00:25:09.530
is?

00:25:09.530 --> 00:25:11.420
I asked this question already.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:13.410
You know the answer.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:13.910
Where is it?

00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:14.225
AUDIENCE: Google.

00:25:14.225 --> 00:25:15.302
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Google.

00:25:15.302 --> 00:25:16.760
How many people
know how many times

00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:19.880
I've asked them for an account?

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:20.960
It's many.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:23.090
They never gave it to me.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.160
I would love to run
on Google's computer.

00:25:25.160 --> 00:25:28.160
OK, classical mechanics
goes back a long way.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:29.820
This is what you've
been solving.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.950
You've been doing a
lot of F equals ma.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.412
And there are problems with it
that led to quantum mechanics.

00:25:37.412 --> 00:25:39.370
I'm just going to give
you a couple of examples

00:25:39.370 --> 00:25:41.110
because they're
fun, and then I'm

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:44.640
going to show you a
really goofy movie.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.770
Has anybody seen the
really goofy quantum movie

00:25:46.770 --> 00:25:47.728
that I'm going to show?

00:25:47.728 --> 00:25:48.895
AUDIENCE: Is it Dr. Quantum?

00:25:48.895 --> 00:25:51.660
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: It's not Dr.
Quantum, but that sounds cool.

00:25:51.660 --> 00:25:55.990
Maybe it's Dr. Quan-- no, I
don't think it's Dr. Quantum.

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:59.080
Has anybody seen really
goofy quantum movies?

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.220
I love goofy movies.

00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:04.630
If you had me for 3012, you
know I like strange movies.

00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:06.960
It's a little thing.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.710
And they're just a
couple, so I promise

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:09.877
you there won't be too many.

00:26:09.877 --> 00:26:14.170
One I'll show you today, and
one I'll show you on Thursday.

00:26:14.170 --> 00:26:17.680
Some of the problems
that led to the need

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:20.530
to develop a new theory
were the classical atom,

00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:25.100
the quantization of properties,
the wave aspect of matter.

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.220
We'll talk about those.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.862
And then black-body radiation,
which I won't talk about,

00:26:29.862 --> 00:26:32.070
but that's a really cool
one because of the word they

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:34.710
use to describe the failure.

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:37.650
How many people know
what I'm talking about?

00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:39.468
It's called the ultraviolet--

00:26:39.468 --> 00:26:40.385
AUDIENCE: Catastrophe?

00:26:40.385 --> 00:26:43.120
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Catastrophe!

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.740
I love it.

00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:48.470
You can't really call
theories today a catastrophe.

00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:52.180
You got to have a lot of--
but that was a catastrophe.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.770
That was really a catastrophe.

00:26:53.770 --> 00:26:56.230
Because the energy
that was going

00:26:56.230 --> 00:26:58.660
to be emitted from a black
body just kept going up and up

00:26:58.660 --> 00:26:59.860
and up and up.

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:02.200
And it doesn't do
that in experiment.

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.050
That's a catastrophe.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:05.800
Catastrophe, when you
use words like that,

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.210
you know you need a new theory.

00:27:12.050 --> 00:27:15.980
A lot of really, really,
really smart people

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.540
were thinking about
these problems.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.830
They were aware of them.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.010
They knew they had these
problems back at the time.

00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:24.350
And they were really
working intensely

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:28.290
on saying, well, why are we
having all these problems

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:30.300
describing the world?

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.450
We've been good to
go for 400 years.

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:34.350
And now this?

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.500
350 years.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:37.280
What's going on?

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.670
In the classical atom, the
problem there is that, you see,

00:27:43.670 --> 00:27:45.860
if you think about
a hydrogen atom

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:49.430
as a plus charge surrounded
by a negative charge-- that's

00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:52.250
the nucleus, and
there's the proton,

00:27:52.250 --> 00:27:54.180
and there's the electron.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.670
And if it's orbiting, then
it has to be accelerating.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:01.760
And we know that an
accelerating charge

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.800
is going to give off energy
in the form of radiation.

00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.300
Right?

00:28:07.930 --> 00:28:10.950
Well, if that were true--

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:12.480
and we know it is true.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:16.420
In some situations, they
knew it very well to be true.

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:19.690
That's what a synchrotron is.

00:28:19.690 --> 00:28:22.840
But then this should
just spiral, right?

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.310
And it should just collapse
into the center here.

00:28:27.310 --> 00:28:29.350
Why doesn't it do that?

00:28:29.350 --> 00:28:32.920
Do you know how long a
hydrogen atom should be stable,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:36.400
according to that classical
world, that classical picture

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:37.672
of accelerating charge?

00:28:37.672 --> 00:28:39.130
It's accelerating,
by the way, just

00:28:39.130 --> 00:28:42.040
to stay on course
around this circle.

00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:44.850
So it's giving off
radiation, losing energy,

00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:45.742
meaning its orbit--

00:28:45.742 --> 00:28:47.700
it should come closer
and closer to the center.

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.216
How long would that be stable?

00:28:49.216 --> 00:28:50.091
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:50.091 --> 00:28:52.170
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: What fraction?

00:28:52.170 --> 00:28:54.383
Give me a 10 to the
minus something.

00:28:54.383 --> 00:28:55.208
AUDIENCE: 12.

00:28:55.208 --> 00:28:57.000
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah,
right around there.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.130
10 to the minus 10,
10 to the minus 12.

00:28:59.130 --> 00:29:02.250
That's how long hydrogen
atoms would be in existence

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:06.760
if classical physics described
them, which it doesn't.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:09.040
And then there was this.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.190
And this was a really
cool thing that

00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:17.245
also could not be described
by the classical world.

00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:24.550
And again, this is my reduced
Shakespeare version of quantum,

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:28.210
so we're covering these very
general, very interesting

00:29:28.210 --> 00:29:32.080
topics just to give you
a flavor and a feeling.

00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:33.913
And then, if you
want to learn more,

00:29:33.913 --> 00:29:35.830
there's just so much you
can read about these.

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:38.320
They're really cool
experiments that were done.

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.980
This is the experiment that
won Einstein the Nobel Prize.

00:29:44.740 --> 00:29:47.050
It's very important
work, but it's probably

00:29:47.050 --> 00:29:50.380
one of his least
profound pieces of work.

00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:54.250
But it was very
important, again,

00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:56.950
to start to understand
this duality between waves

00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:59.800
and particles, which I'll
talk about in a few minutes.

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.150
And what he found is that if
you take a piece of metal,

00:30:04.150 --> 00:30:07.510
and you shine a light on it,
the energy from the light

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:11.220
can kick electrons out.

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.040
But what was thought
is that if you increase

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.240
the intensity of the
light, that you'd

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.230
increase how much energy these
particles get kicked out by.

00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:26.400
You just increase the
intensity of the light,

00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:30.600
and then you could get
these things to come out

00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.790
at higher and higher energies.

00:30:32.790 --> 00:30:37.230
But if you plot the energy
of an electron coming out

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.560
of the metal versus the
intensity of the light,

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:41.745
it's a flat line.

00:30:41.745 --> 00:30:43.620
It does not depend on
the intensity of light.

00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:46.710
You get more electrons
out, but you don't get

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:49.900
them to be any more energetic.

00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:55.350
And that had to lead
to a picture of light

00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:59.620
not necessarily being a wave.

00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:02.020
Because instead,
what you find is

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.720
that there is this very
strong direct dependence

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.640
of the energy of the
electrons that come out

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.650
when you shine light
on a piece of metal,

00:31:08.650 --> 00:31:11.560
and the frequency of the light.

00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:14.550
And so what Einstein said
is, well, maybe light

00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:20.080
can be thought of as particles
that have an energy that

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:22.030
depends on their frequency.

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:25.180
And he wrote this thing down.

00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.010
So they have an
energy that depends

00:31:27.010 --> 00:31:31.360
on this Planck's constant, this
thing here, this h, or h bar.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.650
Do you like a bar, do you not?

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:34.780
Do you like pi?

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:36.940
Do you like 2 pi Do you
want to write that, not?

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:42.640
This is all-- it's a free world,
and you guys can write h or h

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.725
bar, however you want.

00:31:44.725 --> 00:31:45.850
That's my feeling about it.

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.060
I'll stop there.

00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.600
h bar.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.280
h.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:56.840
2 pi But you'll need to get
it right for solving problems,

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.430
right?

00:31:58.430 --> 00:32:00.590
But this is the energy,
and it's quantized.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.270
Well, no, sorry, it's
not quantized yet.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:03.350
I didn't say that.

00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:04.640
But it's a particle.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.170
It's based on the frequency.

00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:09.380
The energy goes as the
frequency of the light,

00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:11.830
and that's what was measured.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:14.690
Kind of building on the
understanding of what's

00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:16.280
going on.

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.650
And this is a great one.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:23.210
When you look out-- you
see, if you excite an atom,

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.960
if you excite the
electron in an atom,

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.130
and you let it go back down--

00:32:28.130 --> 00:32:33.880
so if you excite an electron,
let's say of a hydrogen atom.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.610
Here's your hydrogen
atom, and here's

00:32:36.610 --> 00:32:37.930
that electron that's orbiting.

00:32:37.930 --> 00:32:41.290
It's not orbiting, but we're
going to say it's orbiting.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:45.280
And you excite it up in energy,
and then it goes back down,

00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.790
it emits light.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.040
And so you can look
out into the world--

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.730
which is whole lot of hydrogen--

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:58.110
and you can say, well, what
kind of light do I see?

00:32:58.110 --> 00:33:01.823
And you would think, according
to classical physics,

00:33:01.823 --> 00:33:03.240
the classical world
said, well, it

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.820
could be excited to any
amount from different reasons,

00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.140
can excite an electron.

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:09.130
We won't talk about that now.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:12.790
Instead, you look out, and you
see what wavelengths of light

00:33:12.790 --> 00:33:15.520
are coming at you from
hydrogen and space,

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:19.750
and you don't see a
continuous spectrum at all.

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:23.200
You see only very, very
certain wavelengths.

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.580
So why?

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:25.960
How could that possibly be?

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:33.220
That was-- now we say, well,
it's just quantization.

00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:36.500
Particle in a box, which
I'll get to in a second.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:39.370
But back then, they didn't
have particle in a box.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:40.840
They didn't have Schrodinger.

00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:43.570
They didn't even really
know whether light was

00:33:43.570 --> 00:33:46.030
a particle, a wave, or what.

00:33:46.030 --> 00:33:49.630
They were really
grappling with that.

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:54.310
Now-- and it actually
is even more complex,

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:57.860
and we'll see this complexity
in the next couple lectures.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.180
We'll be able to actually
calculate this if we want,

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.330
than just those
discrete energies.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:06.160
There were these big
jumps, and then there

00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:08.020
were these little jumps.

00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.117
What's up with that?

00:34:11.117 --> 00:34:12.659
They didn't just
see discrete things,

00:34:12.659 --> 00:34:14.969
they saw them sort
of bundled up.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.790
And then, if you
were lucky enough

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:20.460
to have looked at
one of these series,

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:24.480
and you were like, a-ha,
I got the green one,

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.090
then you got it to be
named after you, if it was

00:34:27.090 --> 00:34:28.870
one of the first five or six.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:30.179
And that's why they have names.

00:34:30.179 --> 00:34:32.596
And then they stopped naming
them, because they were like,

00:34:32.596 --> 00:34:34.320
well, OK, we kind
of get it already.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.960
Like, I don't know if there's
a name for the sixth one.

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.600
Maybe there is.

00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:39.540
Does anybody know?

00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:40.040
Yeah.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:42.116
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:42.116 --> 00:34:44.449
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: See, now,
I could take that as ageism,

00:34:44.449 --> 00:34:45.830
but I won't.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:51.020
Because, now-- I'm kidding.

00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:54.080
My group makes fun
of my age very often.

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:58.860
Now, OK.

00:34:58.860 --> 00:35:00.720
This is the time to
put down your PDAs--

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.060
if you're in the back
and looking at them--

00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:05.760
and to pay attention, because
this is a really fun movie

00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:08.010
and I wouldn't want you to
miss it just because you're

00:35:08.010 --> 00:35:09.766
texting somebody.

00:35:09.766 --> 00:35:10.712
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:35:10.712 --> 00:35:11.660
- And here we are.

00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:12.410
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Is that quantum guy?

00:35:12.410 --> 00:35:12.910
OK.

00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:15.560
- Granddaddy of all
quantum weirdness--

00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.233
the infamous double
slit experiment.

00:35:17.233 --> 00:35:19.400
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Got to
know about the double slit.

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.140
- To understand this
experiment, we first

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:27.020
need to see how particles, or
little balls of matter, act.

00:35:27.020 --> 00:35:29.890
If we randomly shoot
a small object--

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:33.260
say, a marble--
at the screen, we

00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.780
see a pattern on the
back wall where they

00:35:35.780 --> 00:35:38.630
went through the slit and hit.

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:42.380
Now, if we add a
second slit, we would

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:46.360
expect to see a second band
duplicated to the right.

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:52.570
Now let's look at waves.

00:35:52.570 --> 00:35:56.330
The waves hit the
slit and radiate out,

00:35:56.330 --> 00:36:00.140
striking the back wall
with the most intensity

00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:03.560
directly in line with the slit.

00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:06.380
The line of brightness
on the back screen

00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:08.710
shows that intensity.

00:36:08.710 --> 00:36:12.180
This is similar to the
line the marbles make.

00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:19.560
But when we add the second slit,
something different happens.

00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:24.750
If the top of one wave meets
the bottom of another wave,

00:36:24.750 --> 00:36:27.420
they cancel each other out.

00:36:27.420 --> 00:36:32.190
So now there is an interference
pattern on the back wall.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:36.570
Places where the two tops meet
are the highest intensity--

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:40.750
the bright lines-- and where
they cancel, there is nothing.

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.800
So when we throw things--

00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.690
that is, matter-- through
two slits, we get this--

00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:52.560
two bands of [? hits. ?]
And with waves,

00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:57.190
we get an interference
pattern of many bands.

00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:58.780
Good, so far.

00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:03.030
Now let's go quantum.

00:37:03.030 --> 00:37:06.820
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Now that's
what I'm talking about.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.950
- An electron is a tiny,
tiny bit of matter,

00:37:11.950 --> 00:37:14.310
like a tiny marble.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:18.060
Let's fire a stream
through one slit.

00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.190
It behaves just
like the marble--

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:22.850
a single band.

00:37:22.850 --> 00:37:27.380
So if we shoot these tiny
bits through two slits,

00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:32.320
we should get, like
the marbles, two bands.

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.820
What?

00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:36.070
An interference pattern!

00:37:36.070 --> 00:37:40.480
We fired electrons, tiny
bits of matter through,

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:45.430
and we get a pattern like
waves, not like little marbles.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:46.915
How?

00:37:46.915 --> 00:37:50.860
How could pieces of matter
create an interference pattern

00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.570
like a wave?

00:37:52.570 --> 00:37:54.880
It doesn't make sense.

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.580
But physicists are clever.

00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:00.370
They thought, maybe
those little balls

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:04.120
are bouncing off each other
and creating that pattern.

00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:08.140
So they decide to shoot
electrons through one

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:08.920
at a time.

00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.212
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: This is cool.

00:38:10.212 --> 00:38:13.920
- There is no way they can
interfere with each other.

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.370
But after an hour of this,
the same interference pattern

00:38:17.370 --> 00:38:18.780
is seen to emerge.

00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:21.690
The conclusion is inescapable.

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:24.770
The single electron
leaves as a particle,

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:28.740
becomes a wave of potentials,
goes through both slits,

00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:33.650
and interferes with itself to
hit the wall like a particle.

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:36.140
But mathematically,
it's even stranger.

00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:40.070
It goes through both slits,
and it goes through neither,

00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:42.140
and it goes through
just one, and it

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:44.040
goes through just the other.

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:47.120
All of these possibilities
are in superposition

00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.110
with each other.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:51.030
But physicists were
completely baffled by this,

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:54.130
so they decided to
peek and see which

00:38:54.130 --> 00:38:57.770
slit it actually goes through.

00:38:57.770 --> 00:39:00.750
And they put a measuring
device by one slit

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.960
to see which one it went
through and let it fly.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:09.300
But the quantum world
is far more mysterious

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:11.310
than they could have imagined.

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:15.030
When they observed,
the electron went back

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:17.040
to behaving like
a little marble!

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:21.510
It produced a pattern of two
bands, not an interference

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.550
pattern of many.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:28.740
The very act of
measuring, or observing,

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.680
which slit it went
through meant it only

00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.180
went through one, not both.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:40.421
The electron decided
to act differently,

00:39:40.421 --> 00:39:43.820
as though it was aware
it was being watched.

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:49.100
And it was here that
physicists stepped forever

00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:53.510
into the strange neverworld
of quantum events.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:57.920
What is matter--
marbles or waves?

00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.180
And waves of what?

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:05.575
And what does an observer
have to do with any of this?

00:40:05.575 --> 00:40:13.437
The observer collapsed the wave
function simply by observing.

00:40:13.437 --> 00:40:14.750
[END PLAYBACK]

00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:16.270
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Nice.

00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:17.210
That's pretty cool.

00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:19.610
I mean, it's a little bit--

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:23.210
but does that blow you away?

00:40:23.210 --> 00:40:23.810
Seriously?

00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:27.170
I mean, I-- so here's the thing.

00:40:27.170 --> 00:40:29.780
I strongly recommend
you take this movie

00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:33.590
out the next time
you go to a bar,

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:36.710
and when you're at the
table, maybe you're

00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:37.910
on your second round--

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:39.390
wait, I keep doing this.

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.165
You guys shouldn't be drinking.

00:40:41.165 --> 00:40:42.470
Sorry.

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:44.000
I keep making this mistake.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.732
OK, you're drinking
tomato juice,

00:40:47.732 --> 00:40:49.190
and you bust out
this movie, you're

00:40:49.190 --> 00:40:50.360
going to blow people away.

00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.990
And it's a really great--

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:58.107
it's a conversation starter,
it's an ice breaker.

00:40:58.107 --> 00:40:59.690
And that's why Niels
Bohr said "anyone

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:02.270
who is not shocked by quantum
theory has not understood it."

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:05.130
And here's what's
amazing about it.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:10.780
This is real stuff that matters
a lot for material science

00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.970
and every other
discipline in engineering.

00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:19.215
This is not just some
theoretical, very super

00:41:19.215 --> 00:41:24.110
physics-y, probably not going
to matter to me kind of thing.

00:41:24.110 --> 00:41:26.790
Well, this matters
a lot, because this

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:28.420
is how electrons behave.

00:41:32.110 --> 00:41:34.055
And that's what,
as I said, dictates

00:41:34.055 --> 00:41:35.680
so many of the
properties and materials

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.300
that we care about,
especially in energy,

00:41:37.300 --> 00:41:39.880
which we'll spend some time in
this part of the class talking

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:41.500
about.

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.740
So I got to talk about
Schrodinger's cat.

00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.680
How many of you know
about Schrodinger's cat?

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:51.560
Who can tell me what you
do with this poor guy?

00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.580
Go ahead.

00:41:52.580 --> 00:41:55.063
Somebody-- who said they
knew about Schrodinger's cat?

00:41:55.063 --> 00:41:55.980
What's the experiment?

00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:56.960
Yeah.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.870
AUDIENCE: So you put a
cat in the box, and--

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:00.990
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Put a cat in a box.

00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:05.850
AUDIENCE: And you have some sort
of radioactive element, or--

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:07.100
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Radioactive.

00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.100
AUDIENCE: --Schrodinger liked
to particle, or whatever.

00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:14.900
And you have a Geiger counter
or something to measure it that

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:18.260
will break a vial of poison
if it detects the radiation

00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.300
and won't if it doesn't.

00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.300
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Right.

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.442
AUDIENCE: And so if it radiates,
then it breaks the poison

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:26.150
and the cat dies.

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:28.280
If it doesn't radiate,
then the cat survives.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.620
But until you observe it,
it hasn't done either,

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.507
so the cat's both alive
and dead at the same time.

00:42:33.507 --> 00:42:35.840
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: And that
was-- you see, that's exactly

00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:38.310
right, very nice.

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:42.170
And the rest of that
is you say, well--

00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:47.870
you put it so that it has a half
life something like an hour,

00:42:47.870 --> 00:42:51.690
roughly, between when
it emits a particle.

00:42:51.690 --> 00:42:54.350
And so then you measure
it-- and so after an hour,

00:42:54.350 --> 00:42:59.922
there's a 50-50 chance the cat
has been killed or is alive.

00:42:59.922 --> 00:43:01.880
But the key point is what
you said there, which

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:05.750
is that, until you measure it--

00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:07.670
you see, the little
radioactive thing

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:10.230
is a very quantum
mechanical particle.

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:17.160
So until you measure it, as with
the electron, it's everywhere.

00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:21.600
It's both emitted and
released the poison and not.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.500
The state is quantum mechanical.

00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:27.390
And so what Schrodinger did is
he said, well, that's absurd.

00:43:27.390 --> 00:43:31.590
Because then if you take that
up to the macroscopic levels,

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.300
you can get these
sort of absurdities.

00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:34.860
And that's why he
came up with this,

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:38.400
actually to make a point that
we don't understand this yet.

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.990
That was really the point here.

00:43:39.990 --> 00:43:42.100
And this paradox has been--

00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:43.950
and so, because the
point being the cat

00:43:43.950 --> 00:43:46.350
is both dead and alive
according to quantum mechanics.

00:43:46.350 --> 00:43:47.260
It is both.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:50.910
It is a superposition
of dead and alive

00:43:50.910 --> 00:43:53.657
until you open the box, in which
case, you collapse the wave

00:43:53.657 --> 00:43:54.990
function because you observe it.

00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.620
That would be really what
quantum mechanics tells you.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:08.370
And this paradox has been
one of the central talking

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:10.200
points of quantum
mechanics, or examples

00:44:10.200 --> 00:44:15.780
used to illustrate how
strange quantum mechanics is

00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:16.543
for many decades.

00:44:16.543 --> 00:44:18.210
And it's also led to
a lot of discussion

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:21.780
on how we should actually
interpret quantum mechanics.

00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:24.473
This is called the
Copenhagen interpretation,

00:44:24.473 --> 00:44:26.640
for those of you who are
interested in reading more,

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.840
but there are many, many others.

00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.182
And I have a sheet at the end--

00:44:29.182 --> 00:44:30.390
I'm not going to go through--

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:34.050
where I list like 10 or 15
different interpretations

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:35.280
of quantum mechanics.

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:36.480
How cool is that?

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:40.830
We really don't know
what this all means.

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:42.270
And that's pretty neat.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:45.555
Actually, Schrodinger, I
think, he made this statement--

00:44:45.555 --> 00:44:46.680
which I thought was funny--

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.557
about his paradox.

00:44:47.557 --> 00:44:49.140
"I don't like it,
and I'm sorry I ever

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:51.060
had anything to do with it."

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:53.940
Because I think it got taken
out of context a lot as well,

00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:57.060
and the whole killing
cats is not a very PC--

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.800
but he very carefully
said, pardon my--

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:02.970
in his paper, sorry for
being so crude about talking

00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:04.410
about dead cats.

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:07.100
And the final one to look into,
but I won't talk about more,

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.210
is called the EPR paradox.

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:11.490
And this stands for Einstein,
Podolsky, and Rosen.

00:45:11.490 --> 00:45:14.270
And it's a very
interesting paradox, again,

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:16.020
that comes out of
quantum mechanics, which

00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:22.630
is that you can entangle
the states of two particles

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:23.710
together--

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:27.100
let's say the spin-- so
that its total is zero.

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:29.620
But one is one and
one is minus one.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:31.990
And now as you separate
them, because they

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:34.750
were entangled at one
point, you can separate them

00:45:34.750 --> 00:45:38.140
to very long distances, and
according to quantum mechanics,

00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:40.420
they both have to
really be both.

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:44.110
One cannot be one and one minus
one-- the collection is zero.

00:45:44.110 --> 00:45:46.540
But one cannot be one and one
minus one until you measure

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.040
one.

00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.180
And then that one is
something, and the other one

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:51.100
is the other something.

00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.740
And that actually leads to
some very interesting paradoxes

00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:56.290
involving information,
because you've

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:58.570
gotten information about
something that's more

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:01.480
than the speed of light away.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:02.570
Is that possible?

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:04.450
[INAUDIBLE]
wonderful discussions

00:46:04.450 --> 00:46:07.900
about this kind of stuff
that I won't go into.

00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:08.500
OK.

00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:11.470
So now we're going to get to--

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:12.790
we're going to move--

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:15.800
those are motivations.

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.670
This is what everybody was
at the time grappling with,

00:46:18.670 --> 00:46:22.380
is how can we
explain these things?

00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.660
And what it really came
down to is that particles

00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.760
can be both waves and--

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.080
everything can be both
waves and particles.

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.540
But especially when you get
down to very small masses,

00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:38.760
the wave nature can dominate.

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:41.610
And that is the
case for electrons.

00:46:41.610 --> 00:46:44.400
So for waves, they have
particle-like properties,

00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.985
and for particles, they can
have wavelike properties.

00:46:46.985 --> 00:46:49.680
And that's really
the key observation.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.810
That's the
wave-particle duality.

00:46:51.810 --> 00:46:57.420
And as you saw in the video,
what that means is that--

00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:06.270
you see, a wave is a wave,
which means it can have both--

00:47:06.270 --> 00:47:08.130
it can have interference.

00:47:08.130 --> 00:47:11.400
As you saw, the electron,
they shoot it one at a time.

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:13.020
Not interfering with
another electron.

00:47:13.020 --> 00:47:14.900
It's literally
interfering with itself.

00:47:17.218 --> 00:47:18.760
And you can see that
you can actually

00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:21.603
get interference patterns,
and that diffraction pattern

00:47:21.603 --> 00:47:23.770
that you see on the plate
in the two-slit experiment

00:47:23.770 --> 00:47:28.227
is a measurable wavelike
property of the electron.

00:47:28.227 --> 00:47:30.060
You know what I love
so much about that is--

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:32.070
I don't know if you
caught it, but it's

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:34.670
shot out as a particle.

00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:36.830
It's got to go through
the slits as a wave.

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:39.660
There's no other
way to explain it.

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.560
If you don't observe it,
it goes through as a wave.

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.000
But then in order to--

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.300
the original experiments were
done with a photographic plate

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.310
that can only be--

00:47:49.310 --> 00:47:52.698
the track can only be
made if it's a particle.

00:47:52.698 --> 00:47:54.740
The position of the electron
has to be a particle

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.630
to make the dot on the plate.

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:59.087
So it goes from particle
to wave to particle.

00:47:59.087 --> 00:48:01.170
And that's really the
nature of quantum mechanics.

00:48:01.170 --> 00:48:04.100
You have to be able to
describe particles as waves.

00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.710
And so we start seeing
effects like this,

00:48:06.710 --> 00:48:11.900
where you can get constructive
interference from a particle.

00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:13.820
That's really cool.

00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:16.700
And that's what we need
to be able to describe

00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:20.220
to describe the quantum
world in a computer.

00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:20.850
That's real.

00:48:20.850 --> 00:48:23.290
That's a water
dropping to make waves.

00:48:23.290 --> 00:48:25.650
This is actually an electron.

00:48:25.650 --> 00:48:30.390
This is where an electron
sits on a surface.

00:48:30.390 --> 00:48:31.860
I think that's a quantum corral.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:37.860
And it's been measured
experimentally--

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:40.740
this is the experimental setup.

00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.410
It's been measured
experimentally

00:48:42.410 --> 00:48:44.610
for bigger things
than electrons.

00:48:44.610 --> 00:48:47.470
You think electrons
are really tiny.

00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:49.500
Oh, Grossman only
cares about them

00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:53.520
for his electronics and optics,
but I care about bigger things,

00:48:53.520 --> 00:48:54.480
like fullerenes.

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.590
Well, if you take fullerenes
and you shoot them

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:03.750
through two slits, you also
get a diffraction pattern.

00:49:03.750 --> 00:49:04.750
This is real stuff.

00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:07.830
It happens for
real bigger things.

00:49:07.830 --> 00:49:13.140
OK, but now, could I
go through two slits?

00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:14.070
Is that possible?

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:18.270
Am I quantum mechanical?

00:49:18.270 --> 00:49:20.700
AUDIENCE: Are you
observing yourself?

00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.935
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: I am--

00:49:22.935 --> 00:49:23.435
I--

00:49:25.375 --> 00:49:27.660
I don't have a good
response to that question.

00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:31.440
But I am not observing
myself and no one else is.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.400
Am I quantum mechanical?

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:35.360
Yeah.

00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:38.562
Why don't I create diffraction
patterns wherever I go?

00:49:38.562 --> 00:49:39.394
AUDIENCE: Too big.

00:49:39.394 --> 00:49:40.680
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Too big?

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:41.675
Don't read ahead!

00:49:41.675 --> 00:49:42.930
Why am I too big?

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.510
So where does this stuff end?

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:53.577
Are you always a wave, no
matter how big you are?

00:49:53.577 --> 00:49:55.285
And that's where we're
missing something.

00:49:55.285 --> 00:49:56.890
We're missing something
really important.

00:49:56.890 --> 00:49:58.060
The answer is, absolutely.

00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:01.990
I am a wave, and
I'm proud of it.

00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:06.140
My arm right now is a quantum
mechanical-- this is a wave.

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.440
This is not a particle.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.460
If I throw this chalk--

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.850
that was fun-- that's
not a particle.

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:15.250
That was a wave I just threw.

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.100
It has a wave
associated with it.

00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:19.420
It is very wavelike.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.730
But if I throw chalk
through two slits,

00:50:21.730 --> 00:50:23.770
will I get a
diffraction pattern?

00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:25.130
No.

00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:28.020
And now we're going to see why.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.030
When is a particle like a wave?

00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:32.220
Well, it always is--

00:50:32.220 --> 00:50:33.580
but to varying degrees.

00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:37.290
And that's where de Broglie
came in and generalized

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:41.190
what Einstein had been working
on, and others, and said, look,

00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:42.810
everything has a wave.

00:50:42.810 --> 00:50:47.010
Everything is both a wave
and a particle-- everything.

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:51.150
And he said, and
we can associate--

00:50:51.150 --> 00:50:55.530
we can calculate a
wavelength to these things.

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:56.630
Here's the electron.

00:50:56.630 --> 00:51:01.710
The wavelength of the electron
is 10 to the minus 10th meters.

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:06.990
Now, why is that a distance
that is making electrons really

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:09.000
quantum mechanical?

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:14.310
Or why can't I describe them
classically at that distance?

00:51:14.310 --> 00:51:16.170
What's that distance?

00:51:16.170 --> 00:51:17.160
AUDIENCE: Angstrom?

00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.140
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
It's an angstrom.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:23.000
What happens at
the angstrom level?

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.140
Like, what's an angstrom?

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.270
What's 4 angstroms?

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:28.232
What's 2.447 angstroms?

00:51:28.232 --> 00:51:28.940
AUDIENCE: Carbon.

00:51:28.940 --> 00:51:30.430
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Carbon.

00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:31.510
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE] carbon.

00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:36.390
So that's the level of bonds.

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:37.810
This is it, man.

00:51:37.810 --> 00:51:41.440
This is where--
that wavelength is

00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.650
the same size as the
kind of distances

00:51:44.650 --> 00:51:47.440
that matter to an electron,
like the distance from one

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.970
atom to another.

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:50.240
It's the same.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.970
So that means--
because the wavelength

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:57.110
is so similar to the
world of the electron,

00:51:57.110 --> 00:52:01.403
then that quantum effect is
going to be really important.

00:52:01.403 --> 00:52:04.640
And the wavelength
is 100 times smaller

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.060
for a fullerene, which
means that it's maybe

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:11.480
less important for things
we do with fullerenes.

00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:14.300
What do we do with
fullerenes, by the way?

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.930
Has anybody done
anything with fullerenes?

00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:20.513
Probably not, but what
could we do with fullerenes?

00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:24.770
No.

00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.150
We're still working on it.

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.660
Make what?

00:52:26.660 --> 00:52:27.710
AUDIENCE: Make soccer balls.

00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:29.002
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Soccer balls.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:33.920
You can make pretty high
temperature superconductors--

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:36.140
what would have been considered
very high temperature

00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:38.300
before high TC came on.

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:40.370
You can also make solar cells.

00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:41.450
You can make electronics.

00:52:41.450 --> 00:52:44.535
You can make all kinds of
interesting chemistries.

00:52:44.535 --> 00:52:46.910
And most of the time, the
quantum mechanics won't matter,

00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:49.290
but that experiment showed
that you can still measure it.

00:52:49.290 --> 00:52:51.770
Now I have a
baseball, and here's

00:52:51.770 --> 00:52:54.080
the wavelength of a baseball.

00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.230
Can I measure that?

00:52:57.230 --> 00:53:00.250
But it has a wavelength.

00:53:00.250 --> 00:53:03.520
And it's just-- and
so do I. So do you.

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.860
It's just that this is
20 orders of magnitude

00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:09.780
smaller than the diameter
of the nucleus of an atom.

00:53:09.780 --> 00:53:12.810
That's how tiny the
wavelength is associated

00:53:12.810 --> 00:53:15.150
with these more larger objects.

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:17.700
So you see, these are
very quantum mechanical,

00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:19.410
and they do have--

00:53:19.410 --> 00:53:23.140
they would be able to
give you the same effect,

00:53:23.140 --> 00:53:25.540
if you could pick up--

00:53:25.540 --> 00:53:27.370
if you can measure
distances that small.

00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:38.710
So what we have in
classical versus quantum

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:42.280
is that we have to
describe in a computer

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.800
the mechanics of
waves, as opposed

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.340
to the mechanics of particles.

00:53:46.340 --> 00:53:47.343
So what we had before--

00:53:47.343 --> 00:53:48.760
OK, so that way,
we're going to be

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:52.300
able to describe the wave
and the particle behavior.

00:53:52.300 --> 00:53:55.470
What we had before was this.

00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:57.310
This is the mechanics
of a particle,

00:53:57.310 --> 00:54:00.130
and you all did a lot
of simulating of this.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.410
Did you guys do--

00:54:04.410 --> 00:54:07.890
so did you do
molecular dynamics?

00:54:07.890 --> 00:54:08.420
Yeah.

00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:10.010
So you know about that.

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:14.160
And you did that with velocity
[INAUDIBLE],, leapfrog.

00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:20.460
No?

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:23.250
How did you integrate that?

00:54:23.250 --> 00:54:25.350
Did you pick an
integration scheme?

00:54:25.350 --> 00:54:28.350
How did you solve that equation?

00:54:28.350 --> 00:54:29.780
You clicked Simulate.

00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:32.770
But there are probably--

00:54:32.770 --> 00:54:33.950
yeah, go ahead.

00:54:33.950 --> 00:54:38.760
AUDIENCE: He showed us one
scheme where we used, I think,

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:42.450
the two subsequent positions
sort of got an average velocity

00:54:42.450 --> 00:54:44.770
out of that, and--

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:45.850
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Great.

00:54:45.850 --> 00:54:46.460
AUDIENCE: Got it from there.

00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.050
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

00:54:47.050 --> 00:54:48.240
And so they're-- right.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.460
So here's the thing.

00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:52.630
There are many ways to
solve this equation.

00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:57.910
And some are more efficient to
put on a computer than others.

00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:01.190
But none of them are
really very complicated.

00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:03.640
We're going to have the same
thing with quantum mechanics,

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:05.265
it just gets a little
more complicated,

00:55:05.265 --> 00:55:07.385
because the equation
is more complicated.

00:55:07.385 --> 00:55:09.010
But we're going to
have the same thing.

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:10.630
We'll have an equation
for quantum mechanics,

00:55:10.630 --> 00:55:12.213
and there'll be many
ways to solve it.

00:55:12.213 --> 00:55:15.400
And we're going to learn
a little bit about them,

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.302
and then just kind of
move on and apply it.

00:55:17.302 --> 00:55:19.510
But we'll learn a little
bit about the different ways

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:21.830
to solve it.

00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:26.130
So this wave is now-- you see,
instead of being a particle,

00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:27.540
it's now an expectation.

00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.430
It's a vibration.

00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:30.600
So what we need to
know about a wave--

00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:33.780
oh, yeah, psi.

00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:35.040
Psi.

00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:38.870
When you see psi, that's like
quantum mechanics, right?

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:39.870
Or a fraternity?

00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.830
I don't know.

00:55:41.830 --> 00:55:43.710
But anyway, here it's
quantum mechanics.

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:45.720
And psi is the function.

00:55:45.720 --> 00:55:46.238
That's it.

00:55:46.238 --> 00:55:47.405
That's what we want to know.

00:55:47.405 --> 00:55:50.520
That's the wave function.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:55.240
That's what we're solving for
for the next so many weeks--

00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:56.020
five weeks?

00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.632
Six weeks.

00:55:58.632 --> 00:56:00.090
We're going to be
solving for this.

00:56:00.090 --> 00:56:01.230
This is the wave function.

00:56:01.230 --> 00:56:05.490
This is what tells us where
those electrons are going to be

00:56:05.490 --> 00:56:07.270
and how they're going to behave.

00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:09.360
And so the simplest way
to write down a wave

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:12.270
is what's called the plane
wave, which is just a cosine--

00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:16.560
it's a cosine plus sine,
where you have an amplitude,

00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:22.980
and then you have this vector
k at the spatial position,

00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:25.947
and then this frequency
times the time.

00:56:25.947 --> 00:56:27.780
So this is the simplest
way to write a wave,

00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.790
and you can find
little nice animations

00:56:29.790 --> 00:56:34.430
on Wikipedia of what a wave
like that would look like.

00:56:34.430 --> 00:56:36.740
That's a plane wave.

00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:39.350
And you can see that it's
called a plane wave because you

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:43.220
can look at it as these
moving planes of some sort

00:56:43.220 --> 00:56:45.770
of constant magnitude.

00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:49.842
It's a very simple way
of describing this.

00:56:49.842 --> 00:56:51.340
Maybe there are
more complex ways,

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:55.300
but this is going to be one
that we like in this class.

00:56:55.300 --> 00:56:58.280
Now, what I was telling
you about before is

00:56:58.280 --> 00:57:00.320
what de Broglie did,
which he said, look,

00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:04.490
everything can be
described as a wave.

00:57:04.490 --> 00:57:06.830
Everything can
have a wavelength.

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:09.920
And the wavelength
associated with anything

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.840
is going to look like this.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:12.590
Did I put it here?

00:57:12.590 --> 00:57:13.220
Yeah.

00:57:13.220 --> 00:57:17.390
It's going to go as h
divided by the momentum--

00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:21.190
the mass times the velocity.

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:22.660
So there is a
wavelength that can

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.360
be associated with anything.

00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.890
That's what de Broglie said.

00:57:26.890 --> 00:57:30.880
So he generalized what
Einstein had been working on

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.630
with light to say that
this would be something

00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:35.590
that anything can have.

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:39.550
It can have a
description that can be

00:57:39.550 --> 00:57:43.340
described by a wave function.

00:57:43.340 --> 00:57:45.890
And that's what Einstein
already did this.

00:57:45.890 --> 00:57:46.640
He did that part.

00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:49.160
He said the energy
of that wave would be

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:50.750
proportional to its frequency.

00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:53.610
That was part of the
photoelectric effect.

00:57:53.610 --> 00:57:55.560
OK, so how do we describe it?

00:57:55.560 --> 00:58:01.140
So in the last 10, 15 minutes,
we'll say, this is it.

00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.300
This is where we've
been building to,

00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.070
because we're going
to end with what

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:08.070
we need to do in this class,
which is solve an equation.

00:58:08.070 --> 00:58:10.500
We're going to end just
with a little bit of feeling

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:13.080
of our F equals ma.

00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:16.260
And our F equals ma is
the Schrodinger equation.

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:20.970
And I won't talk about
how it was derived.

00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.890
It's actually-- it's
a wonderful story.

00:58:25.890 --> 00:58:28.780
He was very frustrated,
because this didn't actually

00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.340
agree with some of
the work that was

00:58:30.340 --> 00:58:33.860
being done on relativistic
effects solving this equation.

00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:36.710
And so he refused to
publish, actually,

00:58:36.710 --> 00:58:38.590
his equation for quite a time.

00:58:38.590 --> 00:58:41.170
And he took a
retreat to his cabin,

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:45.880
and apparently came back and
decided he would publish.

00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.340
I love reading these stories.

00:58:48.340 --> 00:58:49.210
Those were the days.

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:51.070
People really published
when they really

00:58:51.070 --> 00:58:53.770
had something important to say.

00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:56.560
That's cool.

00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:57.940
And that was-- it
was just really

00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:00.460
neat to watch the communication
between Schrodinger

00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:06.550
and Einstein, and all these just
brilliant people of the time.

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:07.450
This is our equation.

00:59:07.450 --> 00:59:10.708
This is a wave equation.

00:59:10.708 --> 00:59:12.850
This tells us what
we need to know.

00:59:12.850 --> 00:59:18.220
This tells us how this function
evolved in time and space.

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:26.230
And the key here is that this
side here has the terms--

00:59:26.230 --> 00:59:31.240
this has the momentum
squared term, which-- you

00:59:31.240 --> 00:59:33.040
can look at the previous page.

00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:37.460
When you look at de
Broglie and Einstein,

00:59:37.460 --> 00:59:41.890
h bar omega is the energy
from the frequency,

00:59:41.890 --> 00:59:43.660
and then the
momentum, then you can

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:47.590
go back and see why these
things make a lot of sense.

00:59:47.590 --> 00:59:50.470
But this is going to be--

00:59:50.470 --> 00:59:53.350
this second derivative
here, spatial derivative,

00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:56.420
is going to give you
the momentum squared.

00:59:56.420 --> 00:59:59.360
So that looks kind of like
a kinetic energy term.

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.020
And that's the kinetic energy
plus the potential energy

01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:07.400
times the wave
function gives you

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:11.060
something that's equal to the
time dependence of that wave

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:11.885
function.

01:00:11.885 --> 01:00:14.120
The time derivative
of the wave function.

01:00:14.120 --> 01:00:15.770
That's the Schrodinger equation.

01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:24.650
And for this class, we will
consider that left-hand part

01:00:24.650 --> 01:00:30.340
that has the parts that give
you the potential energy

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:31.390
and the kinetic energy.

01:00:31.390 --> 01:00:35.660
That's basically how you can
think of this, of the particle.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.600
But oh, that's the kinetic
energy of the particle,

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.520
but for a wave.

01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.200
And again, you can
see why, because you

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.660
can go back and see
what this gives you,

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:48.150
what k this gives you.

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:54.150
So that's the kinetic energy,
but it's meant for a wave.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:57.360
And if we assume that this
energy part doesn't depend

01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.950
on time, then the
Schrodinger equation

01:00:58.950 --> 01:01:01.200
is much easier to solve,
and we get something

01:01:01.200 --> 01:01:02.300
that's time-independent.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.925
And that's what we'll
do in this class,

01:01:03.925 --> 01:01:07.130
because we can separate it into
a spatial part and a time part,

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:08.880
and then we can just
ignore the time part,

01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.780
and we can call both
sides equal to a constant.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:15.460
This is just some
very simple algebra.

01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:17.340
And if we do that, we
can set them both equal

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.220
to some constant, let's
call it E, which is--

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.120
there's a reason for that.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.330
And then this full
psi with the time

01:01:24.330 --> 01:01:27.240
will depend on the spatial
part times this exponential,

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:29.162
and we'll just ignore
this for this class.

01:01:29.162 --> 01:01:30.870
We're just going to
care about this part.

01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:36.030
OK.

01:01:36.030 --> 01:01:38.625
So let's end with-- there's
these couple of examples

01:01:38.625 --> 01:01:39.750
that some of you have seen.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:41.750
How many of you have not
seen particle in a box?

01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:45.300
Couple people.

01:01:45.300 --> 01:01:46.320
OK.

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:47.790
But if you have
seen it, you know

01:01:47.790 --> 01:01:50.580
this is still going to be
fun, because particle in a box

01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:52.510
is always fun.

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:58.230
So all particle in a box
is it's the spatial part

01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:04.500
of the Schrodinger equation
solved for one of the simplest

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.480
systems you can
imagine, which is

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.780
that you have some quantum
mechanical particle that can

01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:13.690
exist inside of this region.

01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:16.400
And so in this region,
there's no potential energy.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.880
It's just a free particle.

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.100
It's a free wave.

01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:25.060
But then it has these
boundaries that go to infinity.

01:02:25.060 --> 01:02:26.650
And because it has
a potential that's

01:02:26.650 --> 01:02:30.300
infinite at the
boundaries there's

01:02:30.300 --> 01:02:34.540
only one solution here, which
is that the function has

01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:36.160
to be zero.

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:40.790
And you can convince yourself
of that just by looking at this.

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:44.432
If this is infinity,
psi has to be zero.

01:02:44.432 --> 01:02:45.390
It's the only solution.

01:02:48.210 --> 01:02:50.910
So here's what becomes really
interesting about this.

01:02:50.910 --> 01:02:54.160
So you have-- if you look at
this equation, and you say,

01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:56.820
well, OK, outside--

01:02:56.820 --> 01:02:59.100
so you have two equations
you can write-- one

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.960
where there's a V,
but it's infinite,

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:04.380
in this case, and one where
V is zero, in which case

01:03:04.380 --> 01:03:07.150
that part drops out, and this
is the equation you're solving.

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:10.010
And this has a general
solution, which looks like this.

01:03:10.010 --> 01:03:13.570
It's a sine plus a cosine.

01:03:13.570 --> 01:03:16.120
And from this
general solution, you

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:19.030
can actually write
down what E is.

01:03:19.030 --> 01:03:22.810
That's actually very fairly
simple algebra to get to that.

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:26.350
But what becomes really
interesting and exciting

01:03:26.350 --> 01:03:28.340
is when you apply the
boundary conditions.

01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:30.970
So when you look at
what has to happen here,

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:33.760
you have constraints.

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.010
And those constraints lead
to something really important

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:40.520
that was really, really
frustrating all these people.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.212
What is it?

01:03:42.212 --> 01:03:43.170
AUDIENCE: Quantization.

01:03:43.170 --> 01:03:44.940
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Leads to quantization.

01:03:44.940 --> 01:03:45.810
That's it.

01:03:45.810 --> 01:03:47.130
That's the ticket.

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:51.630
It's when you put boundary
conditions on the simplest

01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:57.170
quantum particle, quantum thing
imaginable, a thing in a box,

01:03:57.170 --> 01:03:59.150
you quantize it.

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:01.550
You quantize it
because, you see,

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:03.800
when I put these
boundary conditions on,

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:08.630
I'm saying that there are
only certain allowable values

01:04:08.630 --> 01:04:13.520
for this, because of this.

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:20.440
So the boundary conditions
cause quantization,

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.110
and that's what gives
rise to the whole thing.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:29.230
That's what gives rise to this
whole world of energy levels,

01:04:29.230 --> 01:04:30.940
and a lot of the
things that we talked

01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:35.870
about in the beginning that were
so challenging to understand.

01:04:35.870 --> 01:04:36.950
So you have quantization.

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:38.117
You also have normalization.

01:04:38.117 --> 01:04:41.120
We're not going to go
through this in great detail,

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.560
but that also helps you
understand what A is.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.825
But you see there,
that has to be.

01:04:47.825 --> 01:04:52.820
k can only be n pi over L
where n is some integer.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:56.360
It can only be that because
of those boundaries.

01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:59.630
And if you go back to the
previous page, you can see why.

01:04:59.630 --> 01:05:03.320
So now, your energy, which
was nice and general as k,

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:06.500
going as k squared, can
only go as n squared

01:05:06.500 --> 01:05:07.650
h bar squared pi squared.

01:05:07.650 --> 01:05:11.360
So it can only go
at certain values.

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:12.710
It cannot be anything else.

01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:18.480
And what you get, then,
is you get energies.

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.830
So you get energies that
have very discrete values.

01:05:22.830 --> 01:05:25.050
And that starts to
remind me of what?

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:27.722
What experiment?

01:05:27.722 --> 01:05:28.722
AUDIENCE: Photoelectric?

01:05:28.722 --> 01:05:30.055
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Photoelectric?

01:05:30.055 --> 01:05:31.430
OK.

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:34.902
And what else, where you
only saw discrete values?

01:05:34.902 --> 01:05:35.860
AUDIENCE: The spectrum?

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.760
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: The spectra.

01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:38.960
The lines.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.992
You only saw discrete colors.

01:05:40.992 --> 01:05:42.200
You only see discrete colors.

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.350
You guys can take a
telescope and look,

01:05:45.350 --> 01:05:46.880
and you'll only see
discrete colors.

01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.950
Now, it also gives
you something else.

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:52.970
It gives you psi, which
gives you these curves.

01:05:52.970 --> 01:05:58.620
So you see, for the first
solution, n equals 1,

01:05:58.620 --> 01:06:00.580
you get a psi that
looks like that.

01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:02.760
But for the next
allowed value, you

01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.200
get a different shape for psi.

01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:05.790
And for the next
allowed value, you

01:06:05.790 --> 01:06:08.840
get yet another shape for psi.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:11.060
Oh, boy, is this important.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.170
Seriously.

01:06:12.170 --> 01:06:13.430
Check this out, OK?

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:16.310
Because now-- OK, so
that helps explain this.

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:18.140
It looks like it might.

01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:24.200
And now we're going to do it
for V equals something that

01:06:24.200 --> 01:06:27.710
looks more like a
harmonic potential,

01:06:27.710 --> 01:06:31.710
and we're going to get
equations that look like this.

01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:32.210
You see?

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:33.710
We get energy levels--

01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:35.930
the quantized energy
levels that look like this,

01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:38.217
and we get psis
that look like this.

01:06:38.217 --> 01:06:40.550
And these are psi squareds,
which I'll tell you about in

01:06:40.550 --> 01:06:42.680
a minute.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:46.190
And that starts to
look a whole lot--

01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:47.150
do I have it?

01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:52.880
That starts to look a whole
lot like the hydrogen atom.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.880
You see, look at these psis.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.840
Look at the shapes of those.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.080
Those have structure,
and they also have zeros.

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.770
They have places
where they go to zero.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:05.900
Now, here's the critical thing.

01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:11.850
The shape of the psi
squared is the answer.

01:07:11.850 --> 01:07:15.090
It's where the electron
is going to be.

01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:20.800
It is the probability of finding
the electron anywhere in space.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.630
Psi squared is the
probability of finding

01:07:22.630 --> 01:07:26.310
a quantum mechanical
particle anywhere in space.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:28.930
It is the wave
function, and it is also

01:07:28.930 --> 01:07:31.720
where the particle will be
with a given probability.

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.640
So the probability of finding
this particle in a harmonic

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:39.490
well is going to
be largest here,

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:41.980
and then almost zero there.

01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:45.740
And then it's going to
go up again, further out.

01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:47.410
And you have these
different solutions

01:07:47.410 --> 01:07:51.100
that only happen for
certain energies.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.860
That is exactly what's observed.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:57.220
So the psi squared
is the probability

01:07:57.220 --> 01:07:58.270
you find a particle.

01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:04.310
Psi, we don't know what it is.

01:08:04.310 --> 01:08:06.280
We don't know what psi is.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.910
Does anybody know what psi is?

01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:09.200
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:12.782
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: No,
that's psi squared.

01:08:12.782 --> 01:08:14.990
Psi is what we solve for in
the Schrodinger equation,

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.073
and that's we're going to
solve for in this class.

01:08:17.073 --> 01:08:19.220
Psi squared gives
us the probability

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:21.260
of finding that particle.

01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:21.979
What is psi?

01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:30.920
What does it mean?

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:34.274
Any guesses?

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:40.899
The square of it
is the probability

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:43.279
that you can find a
particle anywhere.

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:46.270
But what is psi itself?

01:08:46.270 --> 01:08:50.890
People have struggled
with this a lot.

01:08:50.890 --> 01:08:52.120
And you know what I think?

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:54.220
I think people have given up.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:56.140
Because when you
read old textbooks,

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.260
old quantum textbooks--

01:08:57.260 --> 01:09:00.189
I'm talking from
the '30s and '40s,

01:09:00.189 --> 01:09:01.880
they talk about
that a whole lot.

01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.640
And when you read new
quantum textbooks,

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.359
they don't talk
about it anymore.

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:08.040
Because we just
don't really know,

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:11.160
is the answer, what is the
physical meaning of psi.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.520
Isn't that so cool?

01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:17.297
We don't really have
a good grip on it.

01:09:17.297 --> 01:09:18.880
There's a lot of
different discussions

01:09:18.880 --> 01:09:20.529
around what it could be.

01:09:20.529 --> 01:09:22.279
But this is the thing
that means something

01:09:22.279 --> 01:09:23.810
we can measure directly.

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:27.590
It's the distribution of
where that particle is.

01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:29.569
You see, so this is it.

01:09:29.569 --> 01:09:31.250
This is an electron around--

01:09:31.250 --> 01:09:34.790
this is the electron of
hydrogen. And you see,

01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:38.150
when that electron is in--
let's take a look at this.

01:09:38.150 --> 01:09:40.609
This is really important.

01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:46.990
When that electron
is in this shell,

01:09:46.990 --> 01:09:50.395
we already know
that's called the 1s.

01:09:50.395 --> 01:09:53.670
The psi for that
first allowed energy

01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:58.090
level, that first allowed
energy level has a shape to it,

01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:00.290
and it's spherical,
and it looks like that.

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:04.420
And therefore, that is the
probability distribution

01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.120
of the electron.

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.790
That's where it can be in space.

01:10:09.805 --> 01:10:16.550
If I measure where that electron
is, where's it going to be?

01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.430
Yeah.

01:10:24.430 --> 01:10:26.260
AUDIENCE: I mean,
if you measure it,

01:10:26.260 --> 01:10:28.720
you're going to get back
some position for it,

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.850
and it's going to
be at that position.

01:10:30.850 --> 01:10:32.410
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
And I love that.

01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:35.080
If I measure it, it will
be where I measure it.

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:35.878
Which is true.

01:10:35.878 --> 01:10:37.420
And that's actually
the right answer.

01:10:37.420 --> 01:10:40.120
But where will it be
according to that picture?

01:10:40.120 --> 01:10:43.300
How can I use this picture to
tell me where it's going to be?

01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:52.820
That is psi squared for
the electron of hydrogen

01:10:52.820 --> 01:10:53.690
in the first level.

01:10:59.040 --> 01:10:59.540
Yeah.

01:10:59.633 --> 01:11:01.050
AUDIENCE: You guess
as to where it

01:11:01.050 --> 01:11:04.252
will be within that boundary.

01:11:04.252 --> 01:11:05.210
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah.

01:11:05.210 --> 01:11:09.200
I mean, basically, the
answer is that it tells me

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:12.800
where it is more or
less likely to be,

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.830
but it doesn't tell
me where it will be.

01:11:14.830 --> 01:11:17.040
It can't tell me that.

01:11:17.040 --> 01:11:19.170
Psi squared only tells
me a probability.

01:11:19.170 --> 01:11:21.000
It only tells me--

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:22.620
it can tell me where
it can never be.

01:11:25.413 --> 01:11:26.330
That's what these are.

01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:27.620
Those are those zeros.

01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:31.790
When psi squared is zero, that
electron can never be there.

01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:35.390
But it also can tell me
with more likelihood or less

01:11:35.390 --> 01:11:36.990
where I might find it.

01:11:36.990 --> 01:11:39.390
So if I measure it 10 times,
well, most of the time,

01:11:39.390 --> 01:11:40.265
I'll find it in here.

01:11:40.265 --> 01:11:43.960
Maybe once I find
it kind of out here.

01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.850
That's the nature of
quantum mechanics.

01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:48.400
That's the relationship between
the psi that we're going

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:54.860
to solve for and the real deal.

01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:58.490
Now, what you find, then,
is see, the 1s is here,

01:11:58.490 --> 01:11:59.820
and then the 2s is here.

01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:05.080
So these are those
allowable energy levels

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.780
for the atom, which we'll
start with that next time.

01:12:07.780 --> 01:12:11.350
But-- wait, don't go,
we're not done yet.

01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:16.500
So now, I've said that
the system is quantized,

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.100
which means it can only
have certain energies.

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:24.000
That's what the
boundary conditions do.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.090
How does that solve my
classical atom problem?

01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:30.662
The atom only living for 10
to the minus 12th seconds.

01:12:30.662 --> 01:12:31.620
How does it solve that?

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:48.540
So basically-- yeah.

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:51.610
AUDIENCE: It can't radiate away
just a little bit of energy.

01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:55.222
It can't fall in
just a little bit.

01:12:55.222 --> 01:12:56.680
If it's going to
radiate energy, it

01:12:56.680 --> 01:12:58.270
has to fall down
an entire level.

01:12:58.270 --> 01:12:58.840
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Exactly.

01:12:58.840 --> 01:12:59.350
Yeah.

01:12:59.350 --> 01:13:00.910
That's exactly right.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:05.530
These electrons-- it
solves the problem

01:13:05.530 --> 01:13:08.140
of the electron
collapsing into the core

01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.540
because it says the electron
no longer can collapse

01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.090
into the core, basically.

01:13:13.090 --> 01:13:15.340
We've quantized it, so
it just can't do that.

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:18.400
Because you see, here's the 2s.

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.470
And then the 2p--

01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:22.270
you see, there's
s, and there's 2s,

01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:25.160
and then the 2p has
some shape to it.

01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:26.440
I'm just going to put wiggles.

01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:28.040
It's not just a sphere anymore.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.920
It's got shape.

01:13:29.920 --> 01:13:32.020
When you go up higher
in energy, that psi

01:13:32.020 --> 01:13:34.940
squared has funny shapes.

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:38.560
But the point is that the
probability distribution

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:43.570
is maybe around here, and
it goes pretty much to zero.

01:13:43.570 --> 01:13:46.365
It goes very close to zero
in between, pretty much zero,

01:13:46.365 --> 01:13:48.490
where the chance is like
the age of the universe it

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:49.760
won't happen.

01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:52.840
And so what that says
is that that electron

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.840
is just not allowed to be here.

01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:57.490
It cannot be there physically.

01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:59.470
It cannot be in
that part of space.

01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:01.600
How cool is that?

01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:03.910
I mean, how weird
is that, right?

01:14:03.910 --> 01:14:10.030
The electrons simply cannot
exist in between the 2s

01:14:10.030 --> 01:14:10.780
and the 1s.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:13.930
They got to be at
those energies.

01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:15.970
You cannot give it
an energy in between.

01:14:15.970 --> 01:14:21.040
It won't take it, because the
allowed levels are quantized.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.080
There is no in-between.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:25.620
[? Buber ?] was wrong.

01:14:25.620 --> 01:14:26.750
How many of you know--

01:14:26.750 --> 01:14:27.770
never mind.

01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:29.270
Nobody reads Buber.

01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:30.605
Philosopher.

01:14:30.605 --> 01:14:31.730
It's all in the in-between.

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:34.320
Never mind.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.280
Point being that that's
really mind-blowing, I think.

01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.370
The electron cannot--
now here's the question.

01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:45.220
Well, how does it
get from 2s to 1s?

01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:48.130
How does it get there if it's
not allowed to go in between?

01:14:53.300 --> 01:14:53.990
OK.

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:55.580
These are the
interpretations-- we'll

01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.270
pick up with that on Thursday.

01:14:57.270 --> 01:14:58.520
These are the interpretations.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.100
Look at that.

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.470
It's like a whole world.

01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:02.450
It's incredible,
all the discussion

01:15:02.450 --> 01:15:05.480
on how to interpret psi
and the different things.

01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.740
And this is a great one.

01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:09.050
They don't know they're
doing quantum mechanics,

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:11.765
but that is a double
slit kind of statement.

01:15:14.270 --> 01:15:17.930
And finally, this is
what we talked about,

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:21.210
and there's some great books.

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:23.390
There's also many,
many places on the web

01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:26.030
where you can read
more about this.

01:15:26.030 --> 01:15:28.520
And on Thursday,
we're going to start

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.853
going more and more into
how we can solve this

01:15:30.853 --> 01:15:33.020
for real materials, which
is where we're going to be

01:15:33.020 --> 01:15:35.200
in this part of the class.

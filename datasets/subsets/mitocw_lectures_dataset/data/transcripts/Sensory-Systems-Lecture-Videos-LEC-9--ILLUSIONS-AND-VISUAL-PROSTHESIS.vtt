00:00:26.006 --> 00:00:26.880
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.013
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:35.170
Today, we are going
to have two topics.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.050
In the first half we are going
to discuss visual illusions,

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.240
and in the second
half we are going

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.550
to talk about prosthetic
devices for the blind.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.050
What I would like to
start with is, again,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.110
to send around the
attendance sheet,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.180
so please put your name to it.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.360
And then, in addition,
I'm going to send

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.430
around some handouts,
one for each person.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.769
I'm going to hand them
out in both directions.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.269
Thank you.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.050
The handouts we're
going to look at,

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.250
I'll refer to them
specifically as we go around.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.640
And I also will show pretty
much the same handouts, figures

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.040
in the handouts, on the screen.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.560
All right.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.820
So for the first half of
the presentation today

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.380
we are going to talk
about visual illusions.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.430
Now, the main emphasis of
what I'm going to talk about,

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.690
it'll be an attempt
to convey to you what

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.220
kinds of procedures one can use
to get a better sense of why

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.935
we see in illusions what we see.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.220
Some of these approaches
are strictly behavioral.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.380
And some of them have involved
experiments carried out

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.720
on a more thorough basis using
electrophysiological procedures

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.270
and so on.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.310
But those I'm not going
to talk too much about.

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.800
But I will relate
what we can figure out

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.380
through how the
visual system works.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.330
Now, because of that, there
are hundreds of illusions,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.440
and I will emphasize
those that allow

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.440
us to think about why
we see what we see.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.450
Now, one of these
illusory effects

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.820
is the so-called
Hermann grid illusion,

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.650
and that's the one
I'm going to start

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.830
with because it's a
fascinating illusion.

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.880
If you look at
this, what you see

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.470
is that at the intersections
you see sort of smudges.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.590
And so the big question arose
as to why we see these smudges.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.480
Now, does everybody
see those smudges?

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.190
If you look at the
handouts, I also

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:13.700
show you-- pay attention
only to the front page,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.340
the one on the left, which
says the Hermann grid illusion.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.440
So if you look at that
either on your handout

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.870
or you look at it
on the screen here,

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.190
you see these smudges at the
intersections, not where you're

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.650
looking at, but in the
smudges other than where

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:34.725
you're fixating.

00:03:34.725 --> 00:03:36.100
Does everybody
see those smudges?

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.940
OK.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.780
So the question arose why
we have these smudges.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:49.640
And back in the
1960s, an investigator

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.380
came up with a
rather clever idea

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.580
of why we see these smudges.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.350
And the person who came
up with this theory

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.330
was a fellow called Baumgartner.

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.380
And so what he proposed,
that this illusory effect

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.000
is not directly attributable
to the center-surround

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.010
organization or the receptive
fields or retinal ganglion

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:11.780
cells.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.579
So what he proposed is that when
a retinal ganglion cell falls

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:21.709
in the center like this, there's
more inhibition in the surround

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.720
than when it falls along
not the intersections,

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.350
but along the straight lines.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.540
And because of that, there's
more inhibition here than here,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.770
and that's why we
see the smudges.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.630
Now, that was a very
attractive theory.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.940
And in fact, it has appeared and
still exists in many textbooks

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.610
that you read about illusions
and about vision in general.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.460
Now, OK, so here is
the exact description

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.930
that I just made
to tell you this.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.000
And of course, you would expect
that if this is the case,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.240
you should also get the smudges
if you'd reverse the contrast.

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.390
And in fact, that is true.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.420
So here, once again, you see
the smudges, maybe not quite

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:06.310
as sharp.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.850
But in this case,
it's whiter smudges,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:14.080
whereas in the previous
case, this one,

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.790
you have darker smudges.

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:19.460
So that kind of fits
with that basic idea.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.840
But then, subsequently,
people began

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.930
to play around with various
conditions to see when you do

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.100
and when you don't
get the smudge effect

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.960
and to see whether that
would fit with this theory.

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.810
Now, that's the basic tenet
in just about everything

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.230
that psychologists
and neuroscientists

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.050
working in the visual system do.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:48.480
They try to critically
examine various hypotheses.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.200
And doesn't have to
be just illusions,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.370
it can be a whole
bunch of other things.

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:56.940
And they do this then by
systematically manipulating

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.050
things in experiments that
can present these things just

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.580
under free viewing
conditions, as I'm doing it

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.250
in terms of these
handouts, or you

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:10.640
can do it under more
controlled conditions.

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.690
The subjects can look through
a tachistoscope or something

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:14.640
like that.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.230
All right.

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:19.780
So anyway, let's now look
at this in a bit more detail

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:24.050
and see what's wrong
with this theory.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.780
Well, first of all, if
you look at this figure,

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.370
what you can see here that
you can see the smudges

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.645
irrespective of the size
of the overall display.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.290
Now, that's a problem
because, of course,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:40.640
the size of the receptive
fields in the retina,

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.530
in their center-surround
arrangement, is constant.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.700
So if it were the
sharp arrangement

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:51.510
that we described about the
way the center and the surround

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.810
are activated by
the intersections

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:57.880
and the non-intersections in
the display, that should not

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.460
apply to different sizes.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.260
It should only work then
for a particular size

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.400
where you approximate that.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.640
Now, I will elaborate on that
in more detail in just a minute.

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.440
Now, another bug
that arose here is

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.130
that if you now turn this
display just 45 degrees,

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.045
all right, so that it's a
diamond rather than a square,

00:07:20.045 --> 00:07:23.765
the illusory effect has
declined considerably.

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.370
And then to make this
even more problematic,

00:07:27.370 --> 00:07:32.750
and this appears in your
handout on that backside

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.110
of the first page,
what you can see here

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.980
is that when you make
the lines arranged

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.060
in such a fashion at slight
angles to each other, then

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.540
you don't see the
illusory effect at all.

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:56.690
Whereas here, we also see it
a little bit less but still

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.470
slightly visible.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:00.350
But here it's not
visible at all.

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:04.600
And you can compare that even
better on the handout there.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:07.520
So the question is,
why would that be?

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.580
Well, we give you
another example here.

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:12.260
If you make serrated
edges-- I don't

00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.090
know if the people in the
back can see the serrations.

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.430
Those of you in front
can see the serrations.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.150
And when you do that,
also you fail to see it.

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:22.290
And the problem
here, of course, is

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:26.490
that if you make these
slight changes in the angles

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:32.909
of the intersecting lines
or you make them serrated,

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:36.860
the center-surround
antagonism should be the same.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.289
And yet such a small change
causes the illusory effect

00:08:41.289 --> 00:08:42.590
to disappear.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:46.830
So that then, in itself,
questions the Baumgartner

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:47.330
theory.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:52.040
Now, there are several other
factors that enter into this.

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.850
This is a very subtle one.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:57.710
If you look at this side,
OK, we have different shades

00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:58.991
for the lines.

00:08:58.991 --> 00:08:59.490
OK?

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.610
On this side, we have the
darkened lines, OK, in front.

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.760
And in this case, they
have them in the back.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.930
And here you see the illusory
effect, and here you don't.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:14.330
And once again, how can that
be if the illusory effect is

00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:16.770
due to the center-surround
antagonism?

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:20.600
Even more dramatic is when
you do this with colors.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.782
Here you have, again, the
colored lines in front,

00:09:23.782 --> 00:09:25.240
and here you have
them in the back.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:30.500
And here you can see
homonymous shades, all right?

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.760
This is darker yellow and so on.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.860
But it's the same color
but a little bit darker

00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.310
at the intersections.

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:41.580
So here you get a pretty
good illusory effect.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:44.800
But once those white
lines are in front,

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.960
we get very little
effect at all.

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:53.020
So that then denotes a number
of problems with the theory.

00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:57.340
And then one more fact is that
when you present the stimuli

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:01.210
at isoluminance, you don't
get an effect at all.

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:03.940
So that then raised
some serious questions

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.720
about the illusory effect.

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.390
And then a
quantitative study was

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:13.150
undertaken to see just what
is the layout of the receptive

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:16.790
fields in this display.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:20.090
And so here what we
have is a display.

00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:25.830
This square here is exactly five
degrees from your fixation, OK,

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:31.610
and you can calculate the number
of midget and parasol cells

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:35.250
that are activated
by that square area.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:39.570
And you can see in total there
are more than 360 cells that

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.390
are being activated
in that little region.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:48.540
And here is a display, in this
case, of only the ON cells,

00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:50.760
and you can double
that by having the OFF

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.570
cells in the same location.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:57.100
Saying that there's just
no good correspondence

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:02.210
whatsoever in the
number of ganglion cells

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:05.220
that are being activated and
how the center-surround is truly

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:11.230
laid out at a point where
you get a very good smudge

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:15.030
effect with this illusion.

00:11:15.030 --> 00:11:17.850
So this then,
taken all together,

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:27.380
raises the issue then if indeed
there's a retina phenomenon,

00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:29.240
why is there no fit here?

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.660
And so it does look
like that it's unlikely

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:33.760
that this illusion
can be explained

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.070
by the center-surround
antagonism theory.

00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:42.460
So then another
theory was advanced

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:45.150
claiming that this doesn't
take place in the retina,

00:11:45.150 --> 00:11:47.930
but instead that it takes
place in the cortex.

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:51.560
And so another theory
that was advanced

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.780
is saying that this happens
in the cortex due to the fact

00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.090
that you have these
simple cells-- we talked

00:11:58.090 --> 00:12:05.530
about those before-- that had
these elongated inhibitory,

00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:10.500
supposedly
inhibitory, surrounds.

00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:15.600
And if one calculates this,
that can explain the illusion

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:19.390
a little bit better,
especially since these cells,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:22.310
even at any given point
in the visual cortex,

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.755
come in several different sizes.

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.970
So that's an alternate theory.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:28.780
But still, further
research needs

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:34.980
to be done to be able to verify
whether this theory is more

00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:41.040
valid than the center-surround
theory in the retina, which

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.390
certainly is totally wrong.

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:47.200
So I think maybe in
another 100 years,

00:12:47.200 --> 00:12:50.280
they're going to drop the
Baumgartner theory out

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:58.190
from textbooks and general
reviews of illusions

00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:59.150
and vision.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.650
OK.

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:03.560
So now I want to show you one
more illusory effect, which

00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:13.370
is a variant of the illusion
that I have just shown you.

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:17.180
And this one is something that
can drive you nuts, I suppose.

00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:23.970
And that appears on the second
front page, the second sheet,

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:26.330
I should say, of the handout.

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:29.100
You can look at it there,
or you can look at it here.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:34.020
And you can see this
scintillating effect,

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:38.380
and therefore it has been
called the scintillating grid

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:39.310
illusion.

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:41.320
It was invented by
fellow called Lingelbach.

00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:43.080
All right?

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.450
That's a very strong illusory
effect, very dramatic.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:49.360
And whether this
can be explained

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.070
by any particular theory
about the visual cortex

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:55.810
still remains to be settled.

00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:00.450
Right now I don't think
there's a specific theory that

00:14:00.450 --> 00:14:03.730
can explain this.

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:08.380
Now, I will now move
on and talk about yet

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:12.740
another illusory effect,
or actually a set of them,

00:14:12.740 --> 00:14:15.960
that has a much
better explanation.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.080
This one we don't
have a handout for.

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.630
If you look at
this display here,

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:24.560
you'll agree that the left and
right bars here are identical,

00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:27.740
right, going in shade
from light to dark.

00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:28.330
All right?

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:32.520
So now what I'm going to
do here-- what I want to do

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.170
is to present these
two images here.

00:14:35.170 --> 00:14:37.730
I want you to fixate
in the fixation spot,

00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:41.230
and we'll count to about,
I don't know, 20, say.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:42.570
Keep fixating.

00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.300
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.640
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.390
And then I'm going
to go back here,

00:14:49.390 --> 00:14:51.890
and you can see that this side
is much darker than that one.

00:14:51.890 --> 00:14:53.105
Everybody got that effect?

00:14:53.105 --> 00:14:53.580
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.913
PROFESSOR: I'll do it once more.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:00.401
Pretty dramatic, huh?

00:15:00.401 --> 00:15:00.900
OK.

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.524
Now I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.670
What I want you to do is to
look at this with one eye.

00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:09.290
OK?

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:10.500
Don't look at it yet.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.620
Wait a while.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.950
Just let your eye get settled.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:16.000
You're going to look
at it with one eye.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.500
And then when I switch over,
I want you to switch eyes.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:20.000
OK?

00:15:21.062 --> 00:15:21.770
All right, ready?

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.520
Go ahead now and fixate,
and we'll count to 20 again.

00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:27.020
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.655
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 20.

00:15:29.655 --> 00:15:30.155
Switch.

00:15:31.860 --> 00:15:34.500
And if you do that, you
don't have an effect.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.000
OK?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.760
So what does that prove?

00:15:36.760 --> 00:15:38.846
Well, that obviously
proves-- that's why

00:15:38.846 --> 00:15:41.780
it's nice to do these little,
itty-bitty experiments one can

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:46.490
do in minutes-- it proves
that this is a retinal effect.

00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:50.020
And the effect is
actually due to adaptation

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:55.020
that we have talked about, when
was it, a couple of times ago.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.140
Now, I want to show
you yet another effect

00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.440
that has a similar arrangement.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.920
What I'm going to do here is I'm
going to put this display on.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:09.080
And what I'm going
to do here is I'm

00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.040
going to turn these
off successively

00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.780
as we go around the clock.

00:16:12.780 --> 00:16:13.440
OK?

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.420
And what I want
you to do, again,

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:18.660
is to fixate here
on the cross, OK,

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.490
and then I'm going
to start running it.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.740
And what are you going to see?

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:26.334
A pretty amazing thing
you're going to see.

00:16:26.334 --> 00:16:27.000
What do you see?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:27.916
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.740
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.080
You see a green
spot going around?

00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.061
Everybody see that?

00:16:35.061 --> 00:16:35.560
OK.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.650
So now the big question
comes up, why on earth

00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.715
do we see this green spot?

00:16:41.715 --> 00:16:42.715
What is the explanation?

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.240
Well, this again is
a retinal effect.

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:53.410
And to test this
in more detail, we

00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:57.780
have to go back to what I
told you about color vision.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:16:59.960
And when I told you
about color vision--

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:04.349
if you remember we did that
experiment with Gaussians--

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:10.220
that if you look at the color
circle, all right, and then

00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:15.710
you adapt to a stimulus here,
which is pretty similar to what

00:17:15.710 --> 00:17:18.810
was on the screen,
then the afterimage

00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:24.740
is on the opposite side cutting
across the color circle.

00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:30.490
So the afterimages that
you see that are in color

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:33.770
can be perfectly explained
by the color circle.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.830
If you adapt to this,
this is the afterimage.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.420
You adapt to this,
this is the afterimage.

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:44.900
It's always straight across
the center line, center point,

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.780
I should say, where you have the
white center, which perfectly

00:17:49.780 --> 00:17:53.620
explains your afterimage.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.075
So what I'll do again, I'll
show this to you just once more.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:02.720
OK, here we go, ready?

00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:07.360
You can experience it again
just to sort of get a sense.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:09.690
It's amazing how
the green circle

00:18:09.690 --> 00:18:11.639
becomes more and more
and more and more vivid.

00:18:11.639 --> 00:18:13.180
Now, one more thing
I'm going to tell

00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:16.020
you is when I turn this
off-- keep fixating--

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:18.960
and then you're going to see
a green afterimage, right?

00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.270
So it proves that, indeed,
it's the afterimage that

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.860
appears over a period of time
with that rotating circle,

00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.195
and it's fully explained
by the color circle.

00:18:31.701 --> 00:18:32.200
All right.

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:35.350
So now we're going
to move on, and you

00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:37.500
look at yet another
illusory effect.

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:41.080
If you look at this display,
what do you see here?

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.980
You see a light square
and a dark square, right?

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:45.990
Everybody see that?

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:51.490
Now, what if I told you
that what you're seeing

00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:53.696
is a total misconception?

00:18:54.567 --> 00:18:56.150
So I'll tell you
what I'm going to do.

00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:59.160
I'm going to leave these two
squares exactly as they are,

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.860
but I'm going to
change the background.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:01.360
Ready?

00:19:03.386 --> 00:19:04.510
What's the difference here?

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.110
The difference is that now the
background is uniform, right?

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.270
And you can see these
two squares are indeed

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.530
identical in contrast, right?

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.081
But now if I go back
to the previous one,

00:19:17.081 --> 00:19:18.580
if you look at it
more carefully you

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.230
can see this goes
from light to dark.

00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:23.650
Of course, the projector
makes this look bluish.

00:19:23.650 --> 00:19:25.870
It shouldn't be, but that's OK.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:30.470
And it's a gradual shift
in the illumination level

00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:35.320
that fools you to think that
one is light, the other is dark.

00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.050
And that has to do
heavily with the fact

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:41.780
that the receptive fields
of cells in the retina

00:19:41.780 --> 00:19:44.210
have center-surround
organization,

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:47.740
and they're sensitive to
local contrast differences.

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.880
That's their make-up.

00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:51.870
And so until I
point it out to you,

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:55.960
can't even tell that
this is a gradual shift.

00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:58.540
And if it did not
change in color,

00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.850
it would be harder to tell.

00:20:00.850 --> 00:20:02.600
And it has to do with
the fact that you're

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:04.900
making local comparisons.

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.240
And because of that, to
make a distant comparison

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.300
you are inaccurate about it.

00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.680
So this illusory effect,
again, can be readily explained

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.410
on the basis of what we know
about the center-surround

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.951
organization of receptive
fields in the retina.

00:20:21.951 --> 00:20:22.450
OK.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:26.780
Now, if you look at the
same thing in color, which

00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:30.450
doesn't come up too well here
because of the projector,

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:34.270
but still you can tell that
these are not the same color,

00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:37.160
OK, again because of
the gradual shift,

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.830
color shift, in the background.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:43.190
But exactly identical they
are, as they had been before.

00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:46.660
So this works not
only for contrast,

00:20:46.660 --> 00:20:48.750
but it also works for color.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:53.441
Now, some illusory effects don't
work for color and some do.

00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:53.940
All right.

00:20:53.940 --> 00:20:58.460
So now yet another
related effect

00:20:58.460 --> 00:21:00.290
that I'm sure some
of you have seen

00:21:00.290 --> 00:21:03.870
before is if you
look at this circle,

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:06.310
we agree that it's
uniform in color.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:11.119
Now, if I cover half of it with
dark and the other with light,

00:21:11.119 --> 00:21:12.410
it still looks pretty the same.

00:21:12.410 --> 00:21:14.410
Maybe it's a little
darker here than here.

00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:18.880
But then if I put a partition
here, as you can see here,

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.750
then this side definitely
looks darker than that side.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:23.820
OK?

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.430
So this, again, looks
at contrast effects,

00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:30.577
and we'll talk about these
contrasts in just a bit

00:21:30.577 --> 00:21:31.285
with more detail.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.060
Next, let me turn to
another illusory effect

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.840
that you can see in many,
many textbooks, which

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:40.960
is called the
wallpaper illusion.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.500
If you look at this--
I'll come to it

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.780
in a second in your display,
where it will appear

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:55.250
on the back of the second
page-- what you see here,

00:21:55.250 --> 00:21:59.770
it looks like that these
are not parallel lines here.

00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:03.300
I shouldn't say
lines, but parallel

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.480
black and white squares.

00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.810
It looks like that they're going
like back and forth like that,

00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:10.640
OK, and it's quite dramatic.

00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:13.710
And so now we can ask the
question, how can we see this?

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:15.650
What is this due to?

00:22:15.650 --> 00:22:18.582
It could be due to the
way they're aligned.

00:22:18.582 --> 00:22:20.165
It could be due to
the fact that there

00:22:20.165 --> 00:22:22.670
is space between
them, that gray space.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.570
And so one can do
experiments like the one

00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:29.930
you have on your
next page there.

00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:32.010
Let me first-- I will
prove that, indeed, we

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.250
have parallel lines here.

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:36.080
These are fully parallel lines,
and they go back and forth.

00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.900
To convince you, you can see
that the lines are identical,

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.110
and yet they do
not look parallel

00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:45.881
at all because of
this illusory effect.

00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:46.380
OK.

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.882
So now what we can do is we can
fiddle around with this a bit.

00:22:50.882 --> 00:22:53.090
Now, that's the kind of
thing you guys would probably

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:55.360
enjoy doing yourselves--
look at various illusions

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.110
and start playing
around with them.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.120
This is an example.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.620
This is a basic
wallpaper illusion.

00:23:00.620 --> 00:23:03.640
And now you turn this into
an equal checkerboard, OK?

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.280
And if you keep the
lines in between,

00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.720
and you get no
effect whatsoever.

00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:13.080
And then here we
eliminate those gray bars,

00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.760
and the illusory effect
is greatly reduced.

00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:18.610
So consequently,
the illusory effect

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:21.150
has to do with both
the fact that you

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:25.470
have space between the
alternating black and white

00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:29.110
bars, meaning these
gray lines here,

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:34.390
and that you have them offset.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:36.605
So when it's not offset,
you don't get it.

00:23:36.605 --> 00:23:38.730
And when you don't have
the bars, you don't get it.

00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:42.590
So these two factors
play an important role

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:46.340
in giving rise to
the illusory effect.

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:51.370
Now, what we also can examine
is what happens at isoluminance.

00:23:52.590 --> 00:23:55.030
And in this case, once
again, what happens

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.470
is that the illusory
effect is still there,

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:00.960
but it is reduced under
isoluminant conditions.

00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.230
And this is not the
isoluminant actually

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:04.730
because of the projector.

00:24:04.730 --> 00:24:06.640
But when it's
perfectly isoluminant,

00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:09.500
then the illusory
effect is largely lost.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:11.280
All right.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:15.510
So now we have a variant of this
illusion which is fascinating.

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:22.300
And this one I will show
you on the next page, OK?

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:25.350
And if you look at
just this display,

00:24:25.350 --> 00:24:29.200
and you are convinced that we
have lines that are alternating

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.000
that are filtered
back and forth, right?

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.760
Well, is that really true?

00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.320
Well, it turns out if you
take a bunch of red lines here

00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.820
that are perfectly
parallel, OK, and then you

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.720
superimpose those
on the display,

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:51.220
you can see that actually
the display is parallel.

00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.210
OK?

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:54.650
The reason it
doesn't look parallel

00:24:54.650 --> 00:24:59.795
is due to the way these
individual little pieces

00:24:59.795 --> 00:25:03.270
that you're not even
conscious of are arranged.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:04.945
So let's look at
that in more detail.

00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.400
Let me add here one more thing.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.300
At isoluminance, you get
practically no effect.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.790
So these illusions, this
one and the previous one,

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:17.200
heavily depend on
contrast differences.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:17.700
OK.

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.780
So here we go.

00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.710
Here's the basic
illusory effect.

00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:24.820
And the way this was constructed
is shown enlarged on top.

00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:31.460
Alternate lines have
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1.

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:32.060
OK?

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:36.810
What you have in the top line,
and the third, and so on,

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:38.320
you have it in this orientation.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:40.220
Here you have them reversed.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:44.560
And that vague cue
is what somehow

00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.080
provides the illusory
effect for you.

00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:51.090
Now, if you make all
the lines similar,

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.610
OK, in other words don't
reverse the alternate lines,

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:58.750
then what you see
here is actually

00:25:58.750 --> 00:26:01.190
the bars are all
tilted slightly upward.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:01.970
OK?

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:03.690
And because of that,
the illusory effect

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:06.830
is not as dramatic as this
one, but you still have it.

00:26:06.830 --> 00:26:07.590
All right?

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:14.090
So what then you
can do with this

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:19.090
is to enlarge on this
effect as shown here.

00:26:19.090 --> 00:26:23.515
It looks like that you have
somehow a very unequal set

00:26:23.515 --> 00:26:30.860
of lines, as a result
of which you do not

00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.140
have a bunch of
clear-cut squares.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:37.380
And if you, again, superimpose
true parallel lines through it,

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.010
you see that they are
actually parallel.

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.510
All right.

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:46.060
So that then explains
that illusory effect

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:51.760
in terms of how we somehow
integrate information of shape

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.790
that we are not even
aware of to have

00:26:55.790 --> 00:26:57.985
a perception of a whole thing.

00:26:57.985 --> 00:26:59.610
Now, that's not much
of an explanation.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.194
It doesn't tell you what
neurons are involved

00:27:02.194 --> 00:27:03.110
or anything like that.

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.350
But it gives you
a general concept

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:07.730
of how that illusory
effect is created.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:17.800
Now we come to yet another
fascinating illusory effect,

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:23.660
and that one is in the next
few pages in the handout.

00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:28.250
So if you take the
backside of page 3,

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:32.010
you will see this
illusory effect here.

00:27:32.010 --> 00:27:33.470
Does everybody see that?

00:27:33.470 --> 00:27:38.100
Now, this illusory effect is
one which gives you a sense

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.950
that you have a whole
bunch of swirls.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:40.942
All right?

00:27:40.942 --> 00:27:42.275
Does everybody see those swirls?

00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:49.780
Instead of seeing 1, 2, 3, 4
circles, you see some swirls.

00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:54.530
And you say what on earth
is giving us that sensation?

00:27:54.530 --> 00:27:58.670
So what you want to do then
is to look at it analytically.

00:27:58.670 --> 00:28:00.780
And what you see
here is you have

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:04.870
alternating black and white
squares, first of all.

00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:06.880
And you say, well,
is alternating

00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.170
black and white squares
the central point?

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.550
But then if you look
at it more closely,

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.810
you can see this is-- I
don't know how they came up

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:17.950
with this one-- what you see
here, if you look at each

00:28:17.950 --> 00:28:20.440
of these, that there's a
gradual shift as you go

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.440
around the circle in the
orientation of the square.

00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:27.550
So this square
becomes progressively,

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:31.420
very slowly, more rotated.

00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.050
OK?

00:28:32.050 --> 00:28:33.799
And that goes around
the clock, and that's

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:35.715
true for every one
of those circles.

00:28:35.715 --> 00:28:42.740
And you can say, well, is it due
to the black and white squares?

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:46.310
Is it due to the change in
the orientation of the squares

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.230
that you're not even aware of?

00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:49.050
Or what?

00:28:49.050 --> 00:28:50.880
So what kind of
experiment do you

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:54.430
do to check this out, to come
up with some understanding?

00:28:54.430 --> 00:28:56.820
What kind of game can you play?

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:58.970
Well, the first
game you can play,

00:28:58.970 --> 00:29:00.840
so you can say,
well, let's eliminate

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.130
these slight changes
in orientation.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:05.910
OK?

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.150
And so what you can do instead,
as shown on the next page,

00:29:10.150 --> 00:29:15.070
is that you have a
bunch of circles,

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:18.290
black and white circles,
which are all the same.

00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:21.110
And as you can see
here, there's no swirls.

00:29:21.110 --> 00:29:26.000
You have four
circles, very clear.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.670
So therefore,
obviously, the squares,

00:29:29.670 --> 00:29:32.670
changing their orientation in
a subtle fashion going around

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:36.120
in the clock, is very
important in introducing

00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.600
this illusory effect.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:42.050
Well, then you can say,
OK, but is that all of it?

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:45.130
And so what we can do here,
as shown on the next page,

00:29:45.130 --> 00:29:48.300
is we can maintain
the orientation shift,

00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:55.820
but we can make them all the
same contrast, as we have here.

00:29:55.820 --> 00:29:58.700
And when you do that, you have
have a rather weak illusory

00:29:58.700 --> 00:29:59.200
effect.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.720
There's still a little bit left
maybe, but it's kind of weak.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:08.360
And then if you instead
make it isoluminant,

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.890
you get some in-between effect.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:16.170
So on the basis of
that, we can conclude

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:19.920
that very important
in this display

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:24.420
is that you have a gradual
shift in the orientations

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.220
of these squares.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.160
And that, in turn, suggests that
somehow the way these squares

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:36.230
activate orientation
selective cells in V1

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:38.670
plays an important
role in giving rise

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.775
to this strange illusory effect.

00:30:42.700 --> 00:30:43.200
OK.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:45.000
So now what we
are going to do is

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.090
to look at yet another
illusory effect, which

00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:50.690
has a different
source, and that one

00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:53.390
is the famous
Muller-Lyer illusion.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:56.260
The fact is that
these two bars here

00:30:56.260 --> 00:31:00.260
are identical in size-- do I
have the picture-- like that.

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.370
OK?

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:05.420
But when you put these inducing
elements, as we will call them,

00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:10.000
OK, on there, you'll swear
that this one is longer

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.110
than this one is.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:12.020
OK?

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.040
So now we can ask the question,
what kind of manipulations

00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:21.480
can we undertake to see
what that is all about?

00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:24.060
And let me come back
to that in a minute.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:26.090
So what you can
do here is to make

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:30.970
the inducing elements and
the bars different in color

00:31:30.970 --> 00:31:35.510
or in contrast, and you still
get a strong illusory effect.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:36.010
OK?

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.350
So making them
isoluminant or making them

00:31:42.350 --> 00:31:46.430
opposite in contrast does
not eliminate this illusion.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:49.140
So the theory that
somebody has come up with

00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.020
is shown here, which
I'm not sure I buy,

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:56.170
but that's
nevertheless a theory,

00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:59.550
it claims that the
brain interprets

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.120
these two displays as
differences in depth,

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:08.910
as if here we had a protruding
edge in a building inside

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:12.210
or a receding edge
as shown here.

00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:16.220
And that difference that
we almost unconsciously,

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.440
if you will, interpret as
being in different depths

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:22.200
is what gives rise
to the illusion

00:32:22.200 --> 00:32:23.690
according to this theory.

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:27.090
Of course, there's a
simpler theory simply saying

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:30.510
that we just integrate these
two bits of information.

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:31.010
All right.

00:32:31.010 --> 00:32:36.020
So now we can ask the question,
if you have illusory effects

00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:40.070
of this sort, is this something
that really takes place higher

00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:44.040
up in the brain, or does it take
place in the retina where we

00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:49.910
cannot separate these
inducing and testing elements?

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:51.945
Well, the way you
can do this-- I'm

00:32:51.945 --> 00:32:54.330
going to show you
another illusion which

00:32:54.330 --> 00:32:55.450
is similar to this.

00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:59.520
Here we have the so-called
Ebbinghaus illusion.

00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.800
This is a very similar
kind of illusion.

00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:05.450
This is a test element
and an inducing element.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:09.594
The test element here
are these two circles,

00:33:09.594 --> 00:33:11.260
and you swear that
this one is a smaller

00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.580
circle than that one is, right?

00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.590
And we have a bunch
of small circles,

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:17.630
and here we have bunch
of large circles.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:19.920
So now we can ask,
well, is this something

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:22.280
that takes place in
the retina or what?

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.055
So what kind of
experiment can you do?

00:33:25.055 --> 00:33:27.480
Well, the experiment
that you can do

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.045
is to present these
displays interocularly.

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:32.975
What does that mean?

00:33:32.975 --> 00:33:35.780
What that means is
that you present this

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.470
to the left eye and
this to the right eye.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.430
And you present
this device that's

00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:43.630
used by psychologists
for this kind of thing.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.190
It's called a tachistoscope.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:46.120
You look through it.

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:49.130
It can present things
separately through the two eyes,

00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:51.190
and you can flash
them on briefly

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.120
so you don't get any
binocular rivalry.

00:33:54.120 --> 00:33:56.660
And when you do that, then
you can systematically

00:33:56.660 --> 00:34:01.080
vary the size of
these to make sure

00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.150
that you can get a
quantitative measure of it.

00:34:04.150 --> 00:34:06.860
And when you do that, you
find that the illusory effect

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:10.620
is just as good under
interocular conditions

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:13.430
as it is under binocular
viewing conditions.

00:34:14.659 --> 00:34:16.469
Because of this
then-- this has been

00:34:16.469 --> 00:34:18.790
done with many
kinds of illusions

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:20.580
including the Muller-Lyer one.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:24.580
And when you do that,
you show, in essence,

00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:27.260
that this is an effect
that takes place

00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:29.270
most likely in the
cortex, certainly

00:34:29.270 --> 00:34:32.350
not in the retina or the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:34:32.350 --> 00:34:34.639
It takes place someplace
where the images

00:34:34.639 --> 00:34:36.210
from the left and
two eyes converge.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:37.790
All right.

00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:43.139
So now yet another
set of illusions

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.679
that I want to show you.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:51.085
I think that these
illusory effects are done.

00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.710
You can take this home and enjoy
it or show it to your friends.

00:34:55.710 --> 00:34:59.200
Now I'm going to show
you a set of just two

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.140
kinds of motion illusions.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.590
OK, here's the first one.

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.930
I want you to look
at the screen,

00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:08.410
and I'm going to flash
something on briefly,

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:09.850
and I'm going to
do it repeatedly.

00:35:09.850 --> 00:35:10.350
Ready?

00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.644
What do you see?

00:35:15.644 --> 00:35:16.810
Do you see something moving?

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:24.370
A very brief sense of
motion that you see.

00:35:24.370 --> 00:35:26.600
This twirls a little bit.

00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:31.480
And this is called
the snake illusion,

00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.805
which is really curious.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:39.270
This has, again, appeared in
quite a number of textbooks,

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:41.900
and we do not have a really
good explanation for it.

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.720
But we have another one,
which I think is related.

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:46.220
OK.

00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:48.330
So what I'm going
to do here, this

00:35:48.330 --> 00:35:51.150
is called the
waterfall illusion.

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.360
So what we are
going to do here is

00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:56.230
I'm going to set this in motion.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:59.680
In this case, I don't
want you to fixate.

00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.240
What I want you
to do is just keep

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:02.736
looking at it in various places.

00:36:02.736 --> 00:36:04.860
You can look here, here,
here, and here, and so on.

00:36:04.860 --> 00:36:05.630
OK?

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.740
And I'm going to let
it run for a while,

00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.240
and then I'm going to stop it.

00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:09.740
OK?

00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:13.220
And I want you to tell me
what is your aftereffect.

00:36:13.220 --> 00:36:13.720
Ready?

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:23.050
OK.

00:36:23.050 --> 00:36:25.020
I'm about to stop it.

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:25.754
Are you ready?

00:36:25.754 --> 00:36:27.170
Pay close attention
to what you're

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:28.545
going to perceive once it stops.

00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.630
Anybody see what happened?

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:34.692
What did you see?

00:36:34.692 --> 00:36:36.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:39.050
PROFESSOR: You see the water
running up here, right?

00:36:39.050 --> 00:36:39.550
OK.

00:36:39.550 --> 00:36:42.550
I'll do it once more so
you can appreciate it.

00:36:54.410 --> 00:36:55.831
Pretty nice, huh?

00:36:55.831 --> 00:36:56.330
OK.

00:36:56.330 --> 00:37:04.480
So this illusory effect is one
that also occurs interocularly.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:14.210
And it has been shown that
when you record from area MT,

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:19.720
we talked about the fact that
area MT is a region where cells

00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:24.360
respond selectively to
direction of motion.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.690
Well, people have
shown that if you,

00:37:26.690 --> 00:37:31.310
for an extended period of time,
a minute maybe or whatever,

00:37:31.310 --> 00:37:39.590
you stimulate a cell in MT
with this kind of a display,

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:45.450
then after you stop it, OK, the
cells with the opposite sense

00:37:45.450 --> 00:37:50.750
of motion will
discharge some, which

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:55.710
then is attributable to the
upward sensation that you have.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:58.040
So it's clear enough
that this is something

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.690
that does take place
predominantly by virtue

00:38:01.690 --> 00:38:06.140
of direction-selective
cells and, probably,

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:09.060
by direction-selective
cells in area MT.

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:10.980
All right.

00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:13.550
So then what we are
going to do here

00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:15.750
is we're going to look
at some other limitations

00:38:15.750 --> 00:38:19.080
and ambiguities in perception.

00:38:19.080 --> 00:38:21.190
And in particular,
we're going to examine

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:23.000
some figure/ground
relationships.

00:38:24.310 --> 00:38:27.030
The first one I'm going
to show you is this one.

00:38:27.030 --> 00:38:32.400
If you look at these two
diagonals, OK, a and b,

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:35.510
they certainly look very,
very different, don't they?

00:38:35.510 --> 00:38:36.080
OK?

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.260
One looks shorter and
a different angle.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.857
But now if I eliminate the
trapezoid in the surround,

00:38:41.857 --> 00:38:43.690
you can see that they're
actually identical.

00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:45.200
OK?

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.283
I'll show it to you again.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.660
Pretty dramatic.

00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:53.525
So that's an interesting
illusory effect.

00:38:53.525 --> 00:38:55.380
And it's clear enough
that this is something

00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:58.560
that takes place in
higher cortical areas.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:02.430
Yet another one here that
I'm going to show you also

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:05.810
has something to do with
figure/ground relationships,

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.630
which has been
extensively studied,

00:39:07.630 --> 00:39:09.640
especially by Gestalt
psychologists.

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:12.770
And I spoke about this a
little bit the last time.

00:39:12.770 --> 00:39:16.890
What you see here is a bunch
of vases, so to speak, right?

00:39:19.049 --> 00:39:19.840
That's good enough.

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.170
So what I'm going
to do now, I'm going

00:39:21.170 --> 00:39:22.544
to show you another
set of vases.

00:39:22.544 --> 00:39:23.950
Are you ready?

00:39:23.950 --> 00:39:25.630
There is another set of vases.

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.371
Everybody see the vases?

00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:28.870
Now, what if I tell
you that there's

00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:30.380
much more to this
than just vases?

00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.800
So if you look really
closely, you're

00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.560
going to see
something else there.

00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:37.017
What else do you see there?

00:39:37.017 --> 00:39:38.420
AUDIENCE: Faces.

00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:41.540
PROFESSOR: Oh, OK, two faces,
two guys facing each other.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:47.520
Now, if I change the relative
number of elements in here,

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.130
which changes the
figure/ground relationships,

00:39:50.130 --> 00:39:52.230
you get a different effect.

00:39:52.230 --> 00:39:54.650
Here you have--
predominantly you

00:39:54.650 --> 00:39:56.520
see the faces rather
than the vases.

00:39:57.810 --> 00:39:58.620
OK?

00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.090
And that's a cute
way of putting it.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:03.080
I see the faces, not the vases.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.580
And then you switch
it, and you say,

00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:06.930
I see the vases, not the faces.

00:40:06.930 --> 00:40:07.530
All right?

00:40:07.530 --> 00:40:10.970
So that then is a way you
can play around, again,

00:40:10.970 --> 00:40:14.050
with various illusory
effects by fiddling around

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.750
on your computer and
creating things like that.

00:40:16.750 --> 00:40:17.510
OK.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:22.590
Now, yet another
strange effect is

00:40:22.590 --> 00:40:25.330
where you can have
difficulty telling what's

00:40:25.330 --> 00:40:27.250
what is this kind of a display.

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.525
You say, well, what's
happening here?

00:40:29.525 --> 00:40:31.310
Are arrows pointing
to the right,

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.370
or are they pointing
to the left?

00:40:33.370 --> 00:40:37.570
And that reminds one of a
fellow called Yogi Berra.

00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:40.140
How many of you have
ever heard of Yogi Berra?

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:41.840
Oh, my goodness, very good.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:42.340
OK.

00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:49.130
So he was a famous catcher for
the New York Yankees, right?

00:40:49.130 --> 00:40:52.060
Well, he was a very
interesting guy,

00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.170
had all kinds of
interesting statements.

00:40:54.170 --> 00:40:58.010
And one of those many curious
statements, one of them

00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:59.360
is-- it doesn't relate to this.

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.680
It just comes into my head.

00:41:00.680 --> 00:41:02.810
"It isn't over until it's over."

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:04.260
That's one of his, OK?

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:06.080
This one here
that's relevant is,

00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.163
"When you get to a fork
in the road, take it."

00:41:09.163 --> 00:41:10.150
Yeah?

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.810
And that's a Yogi Berra quote.

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:14.290
And so what we have
here is a sign that you

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.629
come to a fork in the road, and
you have to decide to take it.

00:41:17.629 --> 00:41:18.670
What are you going to do?

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:21.253
Are you going to go this way,
or are you going to go that way?

00:41:21.253 --> 00:41:23.090
So that's a kind of
game you can play

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:27.120
with this kind of strange
effect that you can create

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:31.490
that is confusing your
ability to organize

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:32.420
your visual percepts.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.350
Another famous one, maybe
not that famous, actually.

00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:39.330
Maybe some of you
have seen this.

00:41:39.330 --> 00:41:43.475
This, again, has appeared many,
many years ago in The New.

00:41:43.475 --> 00:41:43.975
Yorker.

00:41:45.050 --> 00:41:47.030
It says, "I'm turning
into my mother."

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:48.580
Now, keep looking
at it and tell me,

00:41:48.580 --> 00:41:51.980
why do you think that that
comment is being made?

00:41:56.210 --> 00:42:00.730
What we have here, a young woman
looking at another young woman,

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:01.650
right?

00:42:01.650 --> 00:42:05.140
But now if you keep looking
at this display, look.

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.470
This is a nose here,
and this is a mouth.

00:42:09.170 --> 00:42:10.450
You see an old lady now?

00:42:11.411 --> 00:42:11.910
OK.

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:16.660
You played around with this, it
gives you a confusing percept.

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:18.820
And ultimately, you can
see the young person

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:22.840
looking that way or an old
lady looking the other way.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.800
I mean looking not
backwards but across.

00:42:27.942 --> 00:42:29.400
And that's why this
statement says,

00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:33.350
"I'm turning into my mother."

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:38.880
So the essence here
is that playing around

00:42:38.880 --> 00:42:41.780
with these kinds of illusory
effect is a lot of fun,

00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.940
and we all very much enjoy
looking at illusions.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.340
And some of us like to
play around with them

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:52.875
to try to figure out what their
existence is for the reasons.

00:42:52.875 --> 00:42:55.120
Now, I want to
show you one more,

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:57.720
which I think is very
appropriate at this time.

00:42:57.720 --> 00:43:00.270
This is the famous
Greek key motif.

00:43:00.270 --> 00:43:02.450
Everybody's seen
this, I presume.

00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:05.895
Does everybody know where
this is displayed, actually,

00:43:05.895 --> 00:43:07.265
at several places?

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.041
In the Senate.

00:43:10.041 --> 00:43:10.540
OK?

00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:15.400
Whenever you have a picture
of the Senate Building,

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:16.660
you will see this.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:17.720
All right?

00:43:17.720 --> 00:43:20.190
Now, that's a little
bit amusing, actually,

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:21.350
if you think about it.

00:43:25.110 --> 00:43:27.460
So this has become
symbolic of democracy.

00:43:28.930 --> 00:43:31.640
And considering just what
happened most recently,

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.210
you could almost
say that, perhaps,

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:39.240
what's happening here is that
you cannot tell whether we see

00:43:39.240 --> 00:43:42.140
this guy or this guy
here going around.

00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:42.640
OK?

00:43:43.457 --> 00:43:45.915
And one of them you could say,
oh, these are the Democrats.

00:43:45.915 --> 00:43:47.730
These are the Republicans.

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:51.066
And you have sort of a conflict
as to which ones you see.

00:43:51.066 --> 00:43:51.800
All right?

00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.420
And that is, in a way, symbolic
of what's going on today.

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:59.120
But to educate you
a little bit, which

00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:03.500
I suspect probably most of
you know already anyway,

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:09.930
this Greek key motif
actually has its source

00:44:09.930 --> 00:44:13.080
in the so-called
myth of the Labyrinth

00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.260
that had imprisoned
the Minotaur.

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:19.360
Who knows who the Minotaur is?

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:20.240
Oh, very good.

00:44:20.240 --> 00:44:21.180
Many of you do.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:21.680
All right.

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:28.190
So the Minotaur
was a creature that

00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:31.410
was half bull and half human.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.140
All right?

00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:34.980
And what happened, according to
this myth-- and let me tell you

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.310
it's a myth, and it's
a bit of risque thing.

00:44:38.310 --> 00:44:41.700
There was a king
called King Minos

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:46.580
whose wife Pasiphae--
Pasiphae, I'm not sure

00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:51.650
how you pronounce it properly--
is the one who had intercourse

00:44:51.650 --> 00:44:56.790
with a bull and
gave birth-- sorry,

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:59.700
had intercourse with a bull.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.270
And as a result of
that, gave birth

00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:07.570
to the Minotaur, which was a
half-bull, half-human monster,

00:45:07.570 --> 00:45:08.740
if you will.

00:45:08.740 --> 00:45:09.750
All right?

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.510
And that became so
threatening and so irritating,

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.550
I guess, to King
Minos that he asked

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:24.610
one of his subjugates, Daedalus,
to create a maze, a huge maze,

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:28.300
and he put the Minotaur in it.

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.900
So it was such a maze
that the Minotaur just

00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:31.910
couldn't get out of it.

00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:32.880
All right?

00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.310
But then things got
progressively worse,

00:45:35.310 --> 00:45:38.360
and King Minos decided
that he had better

00:45:38.360 --> 00:45:42.220
get this Minotaur killed.

00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:50.979
And so he asked a person
whose name is Theseus, OK,

00:45:50.979 --> 00:45:56.820
to go into the maze
and kill the Minotaur.

00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:03.730
Now, the king also
had another offspring

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:06.450
whose name is Ariadne--
nice name, Ariadne.

00:46:08.740 --> 00:46:14.700
And she said to Theseus that
if you take a ball of thread

00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:19.870
and you walk through
the maze, once you

00:46:19.870 --> 00:46:24.070
do what you have to do, you
can follow the thread back,

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:26.470
and that way you can
get out of the maze.

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:29.120
So that's what Theseus
did, and then he

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:34.060
went on and killed the Minotaur.

00:46:35.890 --> 00:46:39.010
Now, the story didn't end
there because somehow,

00:46:39.010 --> 00:46:43.890
for reasons I'm not sure I
know the details anymore,

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:47.420
King Minos had a fall
out with Daedalus,

00:46:47.420 --> 00:46:51.760
and he jailed Daedalus
and his son Icarus.

00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.620
And while they
were in jail, they

00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:57.050
tried to figure out
how they could escape.

00:46:57.050 --> 00:47:05.250
And so Daedalus
fashioned a pair of wings

00:47:05.250 --> 00:47:11.170
made out of bird's feathers and
wax, and then put it on Icarus.

00:47:11.170 --> 00:47:14.940
And then Icarus, by
doing this, he could fly.

00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:15.780
OK?

00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:18.530
And then he flew and
escaped from the prison.

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:23.470
But unfortunately, he
flew fairly high up

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:25.180
where the sun was very hot.

00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:32.070
That melted the wax, and
Icarus, sadly, fell to his death

00:47:32.070 --> 00:47:33.460
as a result.

00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:35.530
So that's quite the story.

00:47:35.530 --> 00:47:38.160
And that's something that
obviously some of you

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:38.940
already know.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.930
And those of you who
don't, you will probably

00:47:41.930 --> 00:47:46.590
remember, as so many Greek
myths are just fascinating,

00:47:46.590 --> 00:47:48.180
ancient, old stories.

00:47:48.180 --> 00:47:48.680
All right.

00:47:48.680 --> 00:47:53.000
So then here is actually
a reconstruction

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.760
of the kill of the
Minotaur by Theseus.

00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:06.140
And this is actually a
sculpture that exists in Greece.

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:09.350
Pretty nice, huh?

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:12.130
OK.

00:48:12.130 --> 00:48:17.960
Now, the last confusing image
that I wanted to show you

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:23.280
is this one that had appeared--
I think this appeared also

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:28.160
in The New Yorker,
but I'm not 100% sure.

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.440
What you have here
is a confusion--

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.660
do we have three
or two prongs here?

00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:37.960
And the reason I show
this sometimes in class

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:42.960
is because in our department
when it was originally

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:45.930
formed by Hans-Lukas
Teuber, he created

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:47.930
what is called three prongs.

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:48.990
OK?

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:51.930
And then it became sort
of an issue as to, well,

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.020
what are the three prongs?

00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.020
Are there two prongs?

00:48:55.020 --> 00:48:56.120
Are there three prongs?

00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:57.810
Who belongs into which prong?

00:48:57.810 --> 00:49:00.430
And so somebody came
up with this picture

00:49:00.430 --> 00:49:04.950
that was put up as a joke
in the department when

00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:07.670
the department was still in
one of the old buildings that

00:49:07.670 --> 00:49:09.771
doesn't even exist anymore.

00:49:09.771 --> 00:49:10.270
All right.

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:17.500
So that then brings me to the
end of the illusory effects

00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.280
that I thought we'd
talk about briefly.

00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.645
And I will now move on and
talk about visual prosthesis.

00:49:28.591 --> 00:49:29.090
All right.

00:49:29.090 --> 00:49:38.670
Now, as far as
prosthetics are concerned,

00:49:38.670 --> 00:49:41.920
you're going to hear quite a
bit about that from Chris Brown

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:49.580
because in audition, an auditory
prosthetic device, the cochlear

00:49:49.580 --> 00:49:52.400
implant, has become
an incredible success.

00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:57.730
There are well over 50,000
people in the country now

00:49:57.730 --> 00:50:00.470
who have a prosthetic
device like that

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:03.940
that enables them to
hear, to converse.

00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:05.340
It's really incredible.

00:50:05.340 --> 00:50:10.270
Unfortunately, when it
comes to visual prostheses,

00:50:10.270 --> 00:50:14.180
we have nothing
comparable at this stage.

00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:20.320
It's a much needed device that
will take many, many, many more

00:50:20.320 --> 00:50:22.970
years to create.

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:25.780
But I thought I'd give you
sort of a crude sense of how

00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:28.690
that kind of work
progresses because there are

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:31.430
many laboratories that
are trying to come up

00:50:31.430 --> 00:50:37.230
with something that will provide
an ability for people to see.

00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:42.610
Now, I can tell you
that in the world

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:46.320
there are more than 40
million people who are blind.

00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.140
In the United States, there are
more than a million individuals

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.630
who are blind.

00:50:51.630 --> 00:50:54.706
So because of that--
that's a huge number--

00:50:54.706 --> 00:50:57.920
it, of course, is extremely
desirable to come up

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:00.730
with some device
to do this for you.

00:51:00.730 --> 00:51:04.040
Now, this is a very,
very long history,

00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.815
and people have tried
all sorts of things.

00:51:07.210 --> 00:51:13.250
One of those is to try to induce
the ability to see something

00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:18.550
in the world that you
normally see with your eye

00:51:18.550 --> 00:51:21.090
by putting it through
some other sense.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:23.791
Now, a simple example
of that is Braille.

00:51:23.791 --> 00:51:24.290
All right?

00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:26.270
Everybody knows what
Braille is, right?

00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:32.260
That's you can use your
hand to feel something that

00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.250
has protruding
elements in it that

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.290
can be shown in
terms of letters.

00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:38.740
And so as you get into an
elevator and you can't see,

00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:41.860
you can feel it, and then
you can push the right button

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:43.490
to get to the right floor.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:44.350
OK?

00:51:44.350 --> 00:51:46.430
Now, that's one way
it has been done.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:51.480
Another approach had been
to present stimulation

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:55.020
to your somatosensory system,
either by putting something

00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.220
on your back or putting
something on your fingertip,

00:51:58.220 --> 00:52:03.220
that an image would be converted
into actually activating

00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.070
your somatosensory
system that would

00:52:06.070 --> 00:52:12.320
be equivalent to something that
you would perceive if you could

00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:13.180
see.

00:52:13.180 --> 00:52:16.420
So that's the basic thing.

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:19.650
And a tremendous
amount of effort

00:52:19.650 --> 00:52:27.200
has been going on to try to
come up with something to create

00:52:27.200 --> 00:52:30.140
a workable prosthetic
device for the blind.

00:52:30.140 --> 00:52:31.590
Now, there's a lot
of disagreement

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:38.730
as to where such a device
should be placed in the body

00:52:38.730 --> 00:52:42.940
and also a lot of debate
of what kind of procedures

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:43.750
should be used.

00:52:43.750 --> 00:52:46.920
Now, some people
advocate that it

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.200
should be done on the retina.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.140
Some people advocate
it should be

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:55.890
done in the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.780
Actually, some
work is being done

00:52:57.780 --> 00:53:01.200
at Harvard trying to
come up with something

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.860
for the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.355
And there's some
people who think

00:53:05.355 --> 00:53:08.940
it would be best to do
it in the visual cortex.

00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:12.290
So let me sort of go into
this in a bit more detail.

00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:15.920
And let me, first of all,
raise the question of,

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:19.630
what kinds of devices, and
what kinds of necessities

00:53:19.630 --> 00:53:23.920
do we have for converting
vision into something

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:27.080
that enables blind
people to see?

00:53:27.080 --> 00:53:29.840
Well, first of all,
it's very important

00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:33.210
to be able to see some basic
patterns, very important to see

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:36.380
motion, and very
important, often ignored,

00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:38.230
is that you got to be
able to see something

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:41.300
in the third dimension,
because a person who is blind,

00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.630
he should be able to
walk in the world.

00:53:43.630 --> 00:53:45.330
And if you're going
to walk around,

00:53:45.330 --> 00:53:48.740
you should be able to see
where things are in depth.

00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.060
So those are the
basic requirements.

00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:55.600
You're certainly not required
to process color information.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:56.601
So that's not important.

00:53:56.601 --> 00:53:59.016
And there are several other
things that are not important.

00:53:59.016 --> 00:54:00.880
But these are the three
most important ones

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:03.570
that you would like to
have if you are going

00:54:03.570 --> 00:54:05.940
to create a prosthetics
device for the blind.

00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.215
Now, then the next
question is, how are we

00:54:08.215 --> 00:54:09.840
going to deal with
this, and what kinds

00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:12.080
of issues and problems
are we going to deal with?

00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:16.520
First of all, the big issue is
what kind of prosthetic device

00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.255
should we use.

00:54:18.810 --> 00:54:21.040
One of those that
I've already mentioned

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:26.670
is to try to convert
visual impressions

00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:31.580
into other modalities such
as your somatosensory system.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.320
All right?

00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:39.260
The other is to create some
sort of stimulating device,

00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:42.280
which there are various kinds.

00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:44.130
But one of those
would be, for example,

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:47.500
to put a bunch of
electrodes into the brain,

00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:52.210
or into the retina, or whatever,
and then selectively stimulate

00:54:52.210 --> 00:54:53.950
through this series
of electrodes

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:56.780
to mimic the visual field.

00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.550
Now, the other one,
and it is a big issue,

00:54:59.550 --> 00:55:03.500
what brain areas
should be considered?

00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:06.110
And because we're at
an early stage in this,

00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:11.000
I think it is
desirable for people

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:17.390
to pursue just about any
area they think might work.

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:23.859
Now, the problem with
a retinal implant--

00:55:23.859 --> 00:55:25.150
there are two problems with it.

00:55:25.150 --> 00:55:29.360
One is the retina is extremely
small, and very confined,

00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:36.630
and has these millions of
receptors and ganglion cells,

00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:39.180
and how can you
selectively activate them?

00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:41.000
Now, the biggest
problem, though,

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.060
is that in most blind
people, the retina

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:48.490
becomes non-functional.

00:55:48.490 --> 00:55:53.380
And even worse, it degenerates
in a relatively short time

00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:58.225
so that it no longer is useful
for electrical stimulation

00:55:58.225 --> 00:56:00.540
or for whatever
kind of stimulation

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:02.340
you wish to engage in.

00:56:02.340 --> 00:56:05.549
So because of that,
some people have

00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:07.340
moved on to the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:56:08.590 --> 00:56:12.440
That area has some problems
because it's deep in the brain,

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:13.465
and it's quite small.

00:56:14.930 --> 00:56:15.920
OK?

00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.370
And also, it tends to
degenerate over time,

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:24.200
although it takes it a lot
longer than the degeneration

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.460
of the retina.

00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:31.305
Thirdly, people have considered
stimulating the visual cortex,

00:56:31.305 --> 00:56:32.680
and that's what
I'm going to talk

00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.110
about in a bit more
detail just now.

00:56:36.470 --> 00:56:39.680
But the last thing that's very
important here-- I think it's

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.340
the last thing.

00:56:40.340 --> 00:56:41.798
Yeah, just let me go back.

00:56:46.658 --> 00:56:47.610
Ah, sorry.

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.510
The third big issue
is, can you create

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:57.275
a device that has longevity?

00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:00.350
As soon as you put
something into the brain

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:03.350
and into the eye,
there's going to be

00:57:03.350 --> 00:57:05.520
some sort of adverse
reaction that

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:07.830
may kill the cells at
the tip of the electrodes

00:57:07.830 --> 00:57:08.950
or something like that.

00:57:08.950 --> 00:57:12.450
So all kinds of
approaches have been

00:57:12.450 --> 00:57:19.400
created to try to increase
the longevity of the device.

00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.770
Now, I'm going to
next look at what

00:57:21.770 --> 00:57:24.990
happens in the
visual cortex, which

00:57:24.990 --> 00:57:29.750
is a promising, at least I
think it is, a promising site

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:33.810
where you could electrically
stimulate and use

00:57:33.810 --> 00:57:37.310
that to create a
visual impression.

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:37.810
All right.

00:57:37.810 --> 00:57:40.240
If you do that-- here
is a monkey brain.

00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:42.030
The monkey is very
well suited for this

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:44.180
because, as I have mentioned
before, the posterior

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:47.330
part of the cortex-- see, this
is area V1-- is lissencephalic.

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:54.720
And so it's relatively easy
to place accurately electrodes

00:57:54.720 --> 00:57:55.690
into it.

00:57:55.690 --> 00:57:56.340
OK?

00:57:56.340 --> 00:58:00.110
So then if what you do
here-- here, just a reminder,

00:58:00.110 --> 00:58:01.510
is the central sulcus.

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:02.810
Here's the lunate sulcus.

00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:04.860
And here, of course, is area V1.

00:58:04.860 --> 00:58:07.730
If you now take the
contralateral hemifield,

00:58:07.730 --> 00:58:10.930
that projects into this region.

00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:11.430
OK?

00:58:11.430 --> 00:58:13.670
This is shown out to
about five degrees.

00:58:13.670 --> 00:58:16.220
That will go to
around here like that.

00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.510
OK?

00:58:17.510 --> 00:58:21.050
So now the next big
question that, initially,

00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:23.080
had been done
actually in humans,

00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:30.570
what do you see when you
insert a microelectrode

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:34.490
into the brain-- as I say, this
was done on humans initially--

00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:37.210
and you electrically stimulate?

00:58:37.210 --> 00:58:38.030
What do you see?

00:58:38.030 --> 00:58:42.310
And this work was done by
Brindley many years ago.

00:58:42.310 --> 00:58:46.730
And he discovered that
when you electrically

00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:54.220
stimulate in the human primary
visual cortex, what you get

00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:58.090
is a small, star-like image.

00:58:58.090 --> 00:58:59.280
All right?

00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.700
So that's what he found.

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:06.150
And so that then triggered
a great deal of research,

00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:10.080
including work in
monkeys, to determine

00:59:10.080 --> 00:59:13.160
what could be done to create
a prosthetic device that

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:14.610
might just work.

00:59:14.610 --> 00:59:17.870
So the first step
then was to try

00:59:17.870 --> 00:59:19.880
to determine what
happens when you

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:21.530
put a microelectrode in here.

00:59:21.530 --> 00:59:26.560
This is, by the way, the
layout of the visual field

00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.750
in the posterior cortex
with much more area devoted

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:33.550
to the fovea than into the
periphery because, of course,

00:59:33.550 --> 00:59:39.160
there's a much higher packing
density of receptor cells

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:41.850
as well as retinal
ganglion cells in the fovea

00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:44.470
representation than further out.

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:47.860
In the cortex, the thickness
of the gray matter is constant.

00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:50.490
It's about roughly
2 millimeters thick.

00:59:52.330 --> 00:59:57.120
And the frequency, spatial
frequency of the cells,

00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:59.100
is pretty constant as well.

00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:03.330
So therefore, you need
to allocate more space

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:09.220
to the incoming huge
number of retinal ganglion

01:00:09.220 --> 01:00:11.640
cells projected
to the geniculate

01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:14.405
and then to the cortex
than for the periphery.

01:00:14.405 --> 01:00:15.780
And that's why
you have this kind

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.605
of a layout of much
more space allocated

01:00:18.605 --> 01:00:21.440
to the central than
to peripheral vision.

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:24.030
So that's a very
important factor

01:00:24.030 --> 01:00:27.870
in considering how to
create a prosthetic device.

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:32.495
So now the first step in
doing this kind of stuff,

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:36.090
if you're going to do serious
experiments on monkeys,

01:00:36.090 --> 01:00:38.630
is to determine,
what does the monkey

01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:42.590
see when you electrically
stimulate the visual cortex?

01:00:42.590 --> 01:00:46.130
And so the experiment
that's been done here

01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:50.050
is one in which a
monkey has been trained

01:00:50.050 --> 01:00:58.040
to make an eye movement to the
bigger of two visual stimuli

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.750
or the brighter of two stimuli.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:02.540
In this case, we have
two visual targets.

01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:04.050
By the way, one
of these is going

01:01:04.050 --> 01:01:08.600
to appear where the receptive
field is of the cells

01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:10.884
that you're going to stimulate
in the visual cortex.

01:01:10.884 --> 01:01:13.300
So then you may sometimes make
this one brighter, this one

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:13.990
brighter.

01:01:13.990 --> 01:01:16.870
And the monkey makes
a saccade to it,

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:19.000
and he gets a drop of
apple juice for reward.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.030
And then you can systematically
vary the relative size

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:25.750
of the two stimuli to see what
kind of a function you get.

01:01:25.750 --> 01:01:29.090
And the same thing you can do
for the relative brightness

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:29.740
of it.

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:33.510
And then on some trials
interspersed with those trials,

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:35.870
you present
[INAUDIBLE] stimulation

01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:37.850
with the visual
target and see which

01:01:37.850 --> 01:01:39.410
one does the monkey go to.

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:41.210
And then you
systematically vary,

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:45.140
as I said, the brightness or
the size of those stimuli.

01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:45.640
OK?

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:50.270
We vary the contrast in
this case, and in this case,

01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:51.510
we vary the size.

01:01:51.510 --> 01:01:52.529
OK?

01:01:52.529 --> 01:01:53.820
So that's the basic experiment.

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.880
And if you do that
systematically,

01:01:55.880 --> 01:02:02.600
you can tell exactly what
the size and the contrast

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.070
is of the visual
stimulus created

01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:08.470
by electrical stimulation.

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:10.900
If you do that--
here's an example.

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.140
When you present
two visual stimuli

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:18.500
and you vary the percent
contrast difference, all right,

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:21.630
of the two stimuli, you can see
that it crosses over, indeed,

01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:22.850
when they're identical.

01:02:22.850 --> 01:02:25.270
So that tells you that
this system works.

01:02:25.270 --> 01:02:27.120
It says these are identical.

01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.155
And the same thing is
true for the size series.

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.820
So this way then, if you
do the same experiment

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:36.620
with electrical stimulation,
you can find out

01:02:36.620 --> 01:02:38.940
where this 50%
crossover point is.

01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:42.050
This is for contrast,
and this is for size.

01:02:42.050 --> 01:02:45.340
So then you can establish
this with slightly different

01:02:45.340 --> 01:02:47.270
locations in the visual field.

01:02:47.270 --> 01:02:49.440
And if you do that
overall, you come up

01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.850
with a summary
statement, which says

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:55.380
that when you use currents
between 20 and 120 microamps,

01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:59.130
OK, at eccentricities between 2
and 1/2 and 3 and 1/2 degrees,

01:02:59.130 --> 01:03:02.190
the contrast of the visual
percept created in monkeys

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:06.280
is 6% to 12%, and the size
is between 15 and 20 minutes

01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:07.880
of visual angle.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.710
Now, that's quite
small fortunately.

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:15.010
So it's a local, little
spot, like a star-like image.

01:03:15.010 --> 01:03:18.980
Now, what do we mean
by 6% to 12% contrast?

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:20.712
So let me tell you
this, that that's

01:03:20.712 --> 01:03:22.170
a useful thing for
you to memorize.

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.400
We talk about percent contrast.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:28.560
What you do is you
measure, for example,

01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:31.490
in candelas per square
meter, what the contrast is

01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:33.800
of this and what is the
contest of the background.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.710
Then you subtract one
from the other, divide it

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:39.580
by the sum of the two,
and you multiply by 100.

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:42.490
So when you do that, this
is roughly 8% contrast.

01:03:42.490 --> 01:03:45.070
This is roughly 75% contrast.

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:48.060
So it gives you a sense
of what contrast means.

01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:48.640
All right?

01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:52.350
So what that means, in essence,
that the visual stimulus

01:03:52.350 --> 01:03:54.065
created by the
electrical stimulation

01:03:54.065 --> 01:03:56.030
is fairly low contrast.

01:03:56.030 --> 01:03:56.530
All right.

01:03:56.530 --> 01:04:00.780
So now the next
important factor,

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:04.120
once one knows what
the visual percept is

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:06.840
that is created by electrical
stimulation in the monkey,

01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:08.890
the next thing is to
ask the question, well,

01:04:08.890 --> 01:04:12.270
what kind of electrode array
should one put together?

01:04:18.210 --> 01:04:18.840
All right.

01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:21.540
Well, the big issue
here has to do

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:23.900
with the so-called
magnification factor

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.220
that I just talked about.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:26.816
So let's look at
this analytically.

01:04:26.816 --> 01:04:28.440
First of all, I
already mentioned this.

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.750
We have a very high packing
density of photoreceptors

01:04:32.750 --> 01:04:35.720
in the fovea and much
lower density further out.

01:04:36.930 --> 01:04:41.660
And so what you have
is that this plate

01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:45.365
goes through the optic nerve
up to the visual cortex

01:04:45.365 --> 01:04:47.580
to the lateral
geniculate nucleus.

01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:49.710
So that's the basic
arrangement, meaning

01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:53.590
that there are many, many
more retinal ganglion

01:04:53.590 --> 01:04:58.220
cells per unit area that
impinge on the visual cortex

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:00.490
near the fovea than
in the periphery.

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:06.150
So then to examine this, here
we have, again, another picture.

01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:07.560
It's the geniculate again.

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:11.370
Here's the fact that the cortex
is constant in thickness.

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:15.810
And here's the layout of the
visual field on the posterior

01:05:15.810 --> 01:05:20.210
cortex with more area
allocated to the fovea

01:05:20.210 --> 01:05:22.300
than to-- excuse me,
than to periphery.

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:22.800
All right.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.455
So now I've shown you a
variant of this before.

01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:31.730
If you present an arrow
across the visual field here,

01:05:31.730 --> 01:05:36.470
this is the impression made
with much more activation

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:39.630
in central vision than
in peripheral vision.

01:05:39.630 --> 01:05:41.620
I mean, you don't have
to worry about that.

01:05:41.620 --> 01:05:45.650
That simply tells you, as
we had discussed before,

01:05:45.650 --> 01:05:49.250
that the images
created depend heavily

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:52.700
on where you stimulate
in the visual field.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:53.210
OK.

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:56.800
So now to look at
this quantitatively,

01:05:56.800 --> 01:06:00.200
so we put a bunch of dots
up in the visual field.

01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:02.370
This is in the
central four degrees,

01:06:02.370 --> 01:06:05.340
and this is the
actual activation

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:06.680
in the visual cortex.

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:07.180
OK?

01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:12.940
Meaning that in the fovea,
we have two elements here,

01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:15.990
this one and this one, here
and here, that they take up

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:18.720
a lot of space, whereas
in the periphery,

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.480
OK, they're very
close to each other.

01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:23.810
That's due to the so-called
magnification factor.

01:06:23.810 --> 01:06:26.310
And so one of the basic
rules is that we've

01:06:26.310 --> 01:06:32.190
got to be able to stimulate
the visual cortex taking

01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:34.620
into account the
magnification factor.

01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:37.310
So if you have this kind
of spatial arrangement,

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:39.360
if we then were to put
a bunch of electrodes

01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:43.290
in like this, which we will
call proportional electrodes,

01:06:43.290 --> 01:06:45.640
then if you
stimulated all those,

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:49.950
you would get a similar
square with one proviso,

01:06:49.950 --> 01:06:53.276
namely that the little dots
would be smaller in the fovea,

01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:54.650
obviously, than
in the periphery.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:59.350
So then if you have this kind
of arrangement, what you can do

01:06:59.350 --> 01:07:06.410
is you can take a camera that
has a fixed number of elements,

01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:08.480
and each of those
elements you hook up

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.960
to one of the electrodes.

01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:12.390
If you put the word
"fiat lux" there,

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:16.120
this is what you hypothetically
would create, like that.

01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:16.960
OK?

01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.550
That's what it would look like.

01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:22.620
So in contrast with
this arrangement,

01:07:22.620 --> 01:07:25.300
if we were to use
an electrode array,

01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:28.070
which you can readily buy-- you
cannot buy proportional arrays.

01:07:28.070 --> 01:07:30.100
You have to somehow
create them yourself.

01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:35.280
But if you buy a fixed
array, which the elements are

01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:37.740
equidistant, then if
you stimulated all those

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.840
you would get a butterfly
image, butterfly image.

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:43.920
I will show a movie
of that as well.

01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:47.370
And that means that if you do
that same conversion as before,

01:07:47.370 --> 01:07:50.860
this is what you would
see in contrast to this.

01:07:50.860 --> 01:07:54.170
So in other words, it's a
greatly distorted vision

01:07:54.170 --> 01:07:57.120
because you didn't take into
account the magnification

01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.061
factor.

01:07:58.061 --> 01:07:58.560
All right.

01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.390
So then what you can
do, actually, you

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:05.603
can also increase the number of
electrodes in the center here.

01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:06.610
OK?

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:08.700
And that would
mean-- in this case

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:13.360
we have 428 elements-- that you
can recreate fiat lux pretty

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:17.029
well with this increased
number of elements,

01:08:17.029 --> 01:08:20.750
where with the original set
you couldn't make anything out.

01:08:20.750 --> 01:08:23.020
Now, the alternate
to this would be

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.420
that you could
take a whole bunch

01:08:24.420 --> 01:08:28.069
of equally-spaced electrodes,
which you can commercially buy,

01:08:28.069 --> 01:08:29.140
and put them in.

01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:33.140
But then to get the same acuity,
you would need, in this case,

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:37.130
something like over
600 electrodes,

01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:40.950
whereas in this case you
would only need about 420.

01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:43.270
So because of that,
obviously we want

01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:46.240
to minimize the number of
things you put into the brain,

01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.670
it's desirable to use
a proportional device.

01:08:49.670 --> 01:08:51.279
So that's the first big step.

01:08:51.279 --> 01:08:54.689
Now, let's assume that you have
created a proportional device.

01:08:54.689 --> 01:08:58.810
The next thing would be to
see, how do you stimulate these

01:08:58.810 --> 01:09:02.930
through a camera?

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:08.460
So what you do then
is an experiment

01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.729
in which you take
a human subject,

01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:13.590
and you can put a
camera on a helmet,

01:09:13.590 --> 01:09:16.649
and also, the person
looks at a monitor.

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:18.865
And otherwise, the
rest of the world

01:09:18.865 --> 01:09:22.020
is excluded by having
this bezel here.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:24.670
And then the camera
looks at something,

01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:28.020
and then it can
display the image here.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:31.460
Well, one thing it can do, it
can display the image as it is.

01:09:31.460 --> 01:09:33.590
But the other thing that's
much more important,

01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:38.740
it can display that image
as if electrical stimulation

01:09:38.740 --> 01:09:39.950
had taken place.

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:42.109
Now, this becomes
complicated because you

01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:53.490
have to do a lot of conversion
of the input from the camera

01:09:53.490 --> 01:09:58.780
to the computer that's going
to then drive the electrodes.

01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:01.990
Now, the first important
point, I mentioned this before,

01:10:01.990 --> 01:10:06.690
is that if you present a small
spot-- this is actual real data

01:10:06.690 --> 01:10:12.020
here-- you present a small spot
in the center of a small array

01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:16.900
of cells in the visual cortex,
you get a vigorous response,

01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.950
whether a light increment
or light decrement.

01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:22.120
But if you use a larger
spot, you get no response,

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:26.140
meaning that the cortical cells
look at local differences.

01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:28.620
That has a lot to do
with what we talked about

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:29.950
with the illusions.

01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:32.140
And so what you
have to create is

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:35.050
an algorithm that mimics that.

01:10:35.050 --> 01:10:36.910
And so the way
you do that is you

01:10:36.910 --> 01:10:40.770
have these individual elements
for each of the electrodes.

01:10:40.770 --> 01:10:48.250
And if that individual
element in the computer that

01:10:48.250 --> 01:10:52.650
gets the input from the camera,
if the whole element gets

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:57.480
activated, there's no real
activation of the electrode.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:59.210
But if an edge
appears like here,

01:10:59.210 --> 01:11:02.570
here, or here, then the
electrode is activated.

01:11:02.570 --> 01:11:03.190
OK?

01:11:03.190 --> 01:11:07.830
So you create local differences
by this conversion system,

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:12.160
all right, by this
algorithm that then,

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:13.900
when the camera
looks at the world,

01:11:13.900 --> 01:11:17.000
will respond whenever there's
an edge, an illumination

01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:17.751
difference.

01:11:17.751 --> 01:11:18.250
OK.

01:11:18.250 --> 01:11:22.160
So now the way this
looks is like this.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:26.295
Again, as I've told you,
whatever is in the fovea,

01:11:26.295 --> 01:11:29.320
the dots are smaller and
further out, but that's OK.

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.820
So that's the basic
activation system.

01:11:31.820 --> 01:11:34.530
And so now what we
are going to do,

01:11:34.530 --> 01:11:39.960
having created
such an algorithm,

01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:44.660
we're going to examine
what the person who

01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:48.030
carries this camera on
his head can actually see.

01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:50.630
Now, the way this can be done,
you can either physically

01:11:50.630 --> 01:11:54.223
move the stimuli in the world,
or the person looks at it

01:11:54.223 --> 01:11:56.820
and can slowly move
his head around.

01:11:56.820 --> 01:11:57.750
OK?

01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:10.170
So let's first
look at what would

01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:19.790
happen if, instead of
a proportional display,

01:12:19.790 --> 01:12:24.490
we used an equally-spaced
display like that butterfly

01:12:24.490 --> 01:12:25.040
display.

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:25.640
OK?

01:12:25.640 --> 01:12:28.720
So what I'm going to
show you here on the left

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.795
is what the camera is viewing.

01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:38.560
And here I'm going to
show you what is actually

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:43.510
perceived by this algorithm, by
the person, where this image is

01:12:43.510 --> 01:12:46.320
converted into what he's
looking at through that bezel.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.076
OK, you ready?

01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.330
I mean, you don't see
a square at all, right?

01:12:59.330 --> 01:13:02.930
What you see is, because
you're not taking into account

01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:05.430
the magnification factor,
you get a huge distortion.

01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:10.290
So now let's go move on
and ask the question,

01:13:10.290 --> 01:13:17.540
well, what happens when you are
using a proportional display?

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:18.040
All right?

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:25.845
And now we get a
rather nice story.

01:13:29.180 --> 01:13:30.920
Again, the visual
display's on the left,

01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.605
and the image created
is on the right.

01:13:32.605 --> 01:13:33.104
Ready?

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.750
So the rule,
therefore, is that you

01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:51.480
must use a proportional image,
proportional display, that

01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:54.790
can be done either by having it
truly proportional as you put

01:13:54.790 --> 01:14:00.030
it into the visual cortex or by
having an equally-spaced array,

01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:04.250
and the computer computes
the proportional arrangement.

01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:05.670
But the disadvantage
of the latter

01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:07.503
is that you need many,
many more electrodes.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:08.620
All right.

01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.360
Now, what I'm going
to do is I'm going

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:17.310
to show you whether
you can read something

01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:19.680
when you use a proportional
display like that.

01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:22.990
And in this case, we're going
to have a bunch of big letters,

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.430
and either the letters
are going to move slowly

01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:28.030
across the visual
field, or your head

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.200
is going to move slowly
with the camera like that

01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.890
to view that display
that's up on the wall.

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:33.630
OK?

01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:42.540
So if we do that--
are you ready?

01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:45.126
See if you can read it.

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:53.180
OK.

01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:54.513
Everybody able to read that one?

01:14:55.850 --> 01:14:56.910
OK.

01:14:56.910 --> 01:14:58.704
Who remembers what
"fiat lux" means?

01:15:02.620 --> 01:15:04.680
I've only shown it about
four or five times.

01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:05.810
Let there be light.

01:15:06.821 --> 01:15:07.320
OK.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:12.390
So now, just to be [INAUDIBLE]
attractive about it,

01:15:12.390 --> 01:15:15.170
I'm going to show
you one more display.

01:15:16.190 --> 01:15:21.670
And this one is
a display, again,

01:15:21.670 --> 01:15:27.720
a series of letters
and words, is one

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:40.990
that John F. Kennedy has used in
a very, very famous statement,

01:15:40.990 --> 01:15:43.880
which I think most
of you will remember.

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.690
And eventually, as you
see the whole thing,

01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:47.100
you will be able
to put it together.

01:15:47.100 --> 01:15:47.683
Are you ready?

01:17:13.281 --> 01:17:13.780
OK.

01:17:13.780 --> 01:17:15.190
Everybody's seen that, right?

01:17:19.150 --> 01:17:21.310
People nowadays, because
of what's going on,

01:17:21.310 --> 01:17:24.370
are less inclined
to take his advice.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.060
All right.

01:17:34.060 --> 01:17:36.680
So that is then
the essence of what

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:38.135
I was going to cover today.

01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:43.610
And so let me now provide
you with a brief summary.

01:17:45.430 --> 01:17:48.490
I will start with
the prosthetics then.

01:17:48.490 --> 01:17:49.210
OK?

01:17:49.210 --> 01:17:52.410
Research on visual
prosthetics is in its infancy,

01:17:52.410 --> 01:17:53.650
as I've noted.

01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:55.880
A great deal of
basic research is

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:58.621
needed before such a device
can become effective.

01:17:58.621 --> 01:18:00.120
That's very unlike
what you're going

01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:03.620
to hear about the
auditory system.

01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:06.660
The brain area that holds
considerable promise

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:11.350
for the prosthetic device
based on electrical stimulation

01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:13.340
is area V1.

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:16.470
Now, a prosthetic device for
electrical stimulation of V1

01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:19.270
must take into account
the magnification factor.

01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:21.350
That's absolutely
essential, and too many

01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:22.890
people are ignoring it.

01:18:22.890 --> 01:18:24.962
Now, in a different
color, we're going

01:18:24.962 --> 01:18:26.810
to talk about the illusions.

01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:29.290
There is no unitary
explanation for

01:18:29.290 --> 01:18:32.360
the great many visual
illusions extant.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.290
I pointed out to you
that different illusions

01:18:34.290 --> 01:18:37.540
have different sources and
different explanations.

01:18:37.540 --> 01:18:40.120
The most popular theory
explaining the Hermann grid

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:42.700
illusion based on the
center/surround organization

01:18:42.700 --> 01:18:45.650
of retinal ganglion
cells is incorrect.

01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:50.050
That's a polite way of
saying it's all wrong.

01:18:50.050 --> 01:18:53.630
A more likely theory
is the one that

01:18:53.630 --> 01:18:57.285
assumes that area V1
cells are involved.

01:18:58.330 --> 01:19:01.380
Retinal adaptation processes
can explain illusions

01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:03.580
based on aftereffects,
and you've

01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.320
seen quite a few of those.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.700
And many illusions disappear
under isoluminant conditions.

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.830
And lastly, there are no viable
theories that explain illusions

01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:16.670
based on figure/ground
relationships.

01:19:16.670 --> 01:19:18.440
We know what they
are, but we don't

01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:23.350
know how the brain resolves
figure and ground effects.

01:19:23.350 --> 01:19:28.120
So that then is the end of
what I wanted to cover today.

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:32.525
And next time, we are going
to talk about eye movement.

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:38.100
And I hope that you
will enjoy that as well.

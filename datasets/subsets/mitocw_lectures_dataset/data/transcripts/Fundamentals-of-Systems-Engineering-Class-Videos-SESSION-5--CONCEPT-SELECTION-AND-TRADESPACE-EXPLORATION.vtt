00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.120
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's
situate ourselves where we are.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.550
So we're starting to really
make a lot of progress

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.860
here, moving in the V model.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.240
Today's topic is session
five: tradespace exploration,

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.220
concept selection, and PDR--

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.440
preliminary design review.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.690
So there's a lot to
talk about, and I'm

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.660
going to go relatively
quickly through this.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.880
So, first I want to talk
about decision analysis.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.960
Fundamentally, when
you come up for PDR,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.470
you have to make a big decision
which is, what concept are you

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.220
going for?

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.344
What is your system
architecture?

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:03.260
That's a big decision.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.720
You don't have all
the details yet.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.120
The design is not
fully done, but you've

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.980
chosen your key architecture.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.720
That's a big
decision, and there's

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.510
a whole branch of research
and science called

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.790
decision analysis.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.360
So I want to tell
you about that.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.650
Talk about some of the issues
in concept selection, and then

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.690
give you some tools
for doing that

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.550
in a kind of organized way.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.720
There's a couple of--

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.830
what I would say, simple methods
Pugh matrix and multi-attribute

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.060
utility--

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.520
that are relatively, I
think, straightforward.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.810
And then there's a bit more
advanced concept called

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.940
non-dominance--

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.050
Pareto frontiers, getting into
multi-objective optimization.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.020
And so, at a minimum, when
you choose your concept,

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.630
you want to choose a
non-dominated concept.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:51.530
And I'll explain
what that means.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.750
And then we'll close with
discussing what is a PDR?

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.160
What do you do with the PDR?

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.560
What's the purpose of it?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.320
So, here is another way to
explain essentially the flow

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.880
of things as we come up to PDR.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.400
So the way you can
think of it as, you

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.960
start with a need, right?

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.110
And your requirements.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.590
That's-- we've talked
about that before.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.270
And then you have
this creative phase,

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:20.950
which we talked about
last time, right?

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.210
You come up with a lot of
ideas, a lot of concepts,

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.500
and the funnel that you
see here is going up.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.730
So each of these shapes here--

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.850
the circle, the triangle--

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.640
they're meant to represent
fundamentally different

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.410
concepts, different
architecture,

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:39.780
different way of satisfying
the requirements.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.750
And so there's a lot of
different things you can do,

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.340
and the funnel opens up.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.570
This is sort of the size
of options or alternatives

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:49.890
you're considering.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.730
And then you have
to filter this down.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.000
In the end, you can only
build one system, right?

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.320
You have to choose
one architecture.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.480
And this filtering down
happens typically in two steps.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.770
One is what we call
concept screening, which

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.380
is more qualitative.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.260
And then the actual
concept selection

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.330
is more quantitative, based
on models, based on data,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.990
based on metrics.

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.350
And then you arrive at PDR.

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.250
So in this sort of
simplified view,

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.250
we've chosen the
square as our concept.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.630
And we've made that
decision by looking

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.620
at these different metrics.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.580
So you can see that
on this graphic here,

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.510
we have metric one, metric two--

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.830
you can see the triangle
is dominated, right?

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.020
The triangle doesn't
do as well if we

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.470
want to maximize
metric one and two,

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.790
so it wouldn't make sense
to choose the triangle.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.070
But the circle and the square--

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.890
circle does better on
metric two, but less well

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.820
on metric one.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.860
The square does better on
metric one, not quite as well--

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.870
and they crossover
at some point.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.740
So, whatever-- how you weigh
this in decision making,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.120
the decision is made.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.710
We're going to go
for the square.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.180
That's our concept.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.620
And then you move to the
actual system design, post-PDR,

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.750
which is all the details.

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.350
So we're expanding the box
now, the square, and designing

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.790
all the details within--

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:21.300
the structure, the avionics,
the software, the controls.

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:25.080
And that's design
modeling and optimization.

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.260
And so here I'm showing you
metric three, which is maybe

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.250
another metric, and then
design variable x1, which

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.190
is some pretty detailed
decision that you

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.230
make within that
concept, and you're

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.470
looking for the optimal, in this
case, minimizing metric three.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.970
It's this point here.

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.470
And then that gives
you your-- and I

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:46.560
put this deliberately in
quotes-- optimal design.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.680
That's what you show at the CDR,
and the critical design review,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.490
and that's what
you go and build.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.650
So that's roughly the
flow of decision making.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.020
Any question about that?

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.980
That general flow?

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.280
So what we'll talk about
today is essentially

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.550
this portion here,
concept screening

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.420
and concept selection.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:13.110
So, since you make a decision,
what is decision analysis?

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:14.900
So decision
analysis, in general,

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.350
is methods and tools
for ranking and choosing

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.280
among competing alternatives
or courses of action.

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.080
And I just want to make--

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.270
the word alternative.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.360
A lot of people use the
word option and alternative

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.670
sort of as synonyms.

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:32.431
They're not.

00:05:32.431 --> 00:05:32.930
OK?

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.010
They're not.

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:36.360
Options and alternatives
are not the same thing.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.250
An alternative means if I choose
A, I can't choose B and C.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.640
But the fact that you've
chosen A, or the square,

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.870
or whatever your concept is,
means that you cannot choose

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:52.310
the other ones.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.885
An option means, well
given that I've chosen A,

00:05:56.885 --> 00:06:00.350
I could also add something
on top of A, right?

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.720
It's kind of like if you
were buying a new car,

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.310
are you going to get the
winter package or not?

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.580
That's an option, but you've
chosen a particular vehicle.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.390
So, that's important.

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:16.070
So alternatives are mutually
exclusive choices or courses

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.710
of action.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.230
So you need the
alternatives, those

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.670
are the components-- four
components of a decision.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:26.570
You need criteria, which means
how are you going to evaluate

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.610
and compare the alternatives?

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.350
Then you need value judgments.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.980
You now apply the criteria
to the alternatives

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.140
to compare them,
and then finally you

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.910
need a decision
maker, which is either

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.120
an individual or a
group with preferences

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:42.980
to then make the choice.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:46.280
Those are the four ingredients
of decision analysis.

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.760
And if we show this somewhat
graphically-- so here's

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.170
our alternatives.

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:55.310
We can do A, B, or C.
The criteria in this case

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.760
are cost, performance, and risk.

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.720
Then we basically evaluate,
in this case, option

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.470
or alternative A, I should
say, for cost, for performance,

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:07.370
for risk.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.880
And this gives us
some score or number,

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.560
and then we need
to figure out a way

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.700
to combine this to
rank the alternatives.

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.650
And when it comes
to ranking, there's

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:21.680
a distinction between what's
known as an ordinal scale

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:23.540
and a cardinal scale.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.410
So in an ordinal ranking all
you really care about and do

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:30.390
is say, what's the best
choice, the second best choice,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.350
and the third choice.

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:33.980
You ordered the alternative.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.580
But you don't know in an ordinal
ranking or ordinal scale,

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.910
whether one and two
are really close,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:45.530
and then there's a big
gap between two and three.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.660
You don't know that, and
you don't really care.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:50.060
All you want is the rank order.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:52.780
When you put things
on a cardinal scale--

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:54.830
so this is a continuous line--

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:58.220
you actually get, in a
sense, both the order

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.920
but you also see how close
the alternatives are.

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.350
So that's a cardinal scale as
opposed to an ordinal scale.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:06.500
OK?

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:08.000
So-- yes?

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.129
Please.

00:08:09.129 --> 00:08:11.420
AUDIENCE: How do you get a
discrete value for something

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:13.862
like risk or
something like that?

00:08:13.862 --> 00:08:15.320
And especially in
an ordinal scale,

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.778
if you have two things that
are really close to each other,

00:08:17.778 --> 00:08:20.774
but the risk is kind of a
blurry region, how do you--

00:08:20.774 --> 00:08:22.940
PROFESSOR: So then they
would be equivalent in terms

00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.500
of that criterion.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:28.020
And you can actually
have ties, right?

00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:30.540
You can have alternatives
that are tied.

00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.240
And I'll talk
about-- this is one

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.830
of the issues in
concept selection

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:35.929
is, how do you do tie breaking?

00:08:35.929 --> 00:08:37.280
Good question.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.900
Any questions at EPFL?

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.890
I know this is very abstract.

00:08:40.890 --> 00:08:44.210
But fundamentally,
that's what we do.

00:08:44.210 --> 00:08:48.370
Any questions over there?

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:50.335
Is it clear?

00:08:50.335 --> 00:08:51.627
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:08:51.627 --> 00:08:52.210
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:53.290
Good.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:55.670
So let's keep moving.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:56.680
So what are the issues?

00:08:56.680 --> 00:08:59.557
I think that's-- so
multiple criteria,

00:08:59.557 --> 00:09:00.640
how do you deal with them?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.850
We usually have multiple
criteria and how do we--

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.970
and eventually, when you
make a decision, when

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:08.800
you pick a concept,
you're somehow

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.630
combining these criteria
into a single measure,

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.820
whether you're doing
that explicitly or not.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:18.260
So how do you deal with
these multiple criteria?

00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:19.880
We'll talk about that.

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.850
Here's the point
that you brought up.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:23.110
What if there's ties?

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:24.970
How do you break them?

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.540
Group decision making versus
individual decision making--

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.910
who gets to really
make the decision?

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:31.780
Right?

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.570
And this relates to the
stakeholder analysis.

00:09:34.570 --> 00:09:38.230
Who has the power to make
the decision in the end?

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:42.820
And then uncertainty-- did
we choose the right criteria?

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.520
Did we evaluate each
option properly?

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.540
And then the big one
is are the the best

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:51.550
alternatives represented?

00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:54.220
So you can choose
among A, B, and C,

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:57.610
but maybe there's this much,
much better architecture

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:01.870
concept D out there, but
it's not in the decision set.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.300
Because it didn't--
nobody thought of it,

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.690
or some other thing happened,
and it didn't come up

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:09.140
in concept generation.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:09.640
Right?

00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.742
So there's a lot
of uncertainties

00:10:11.742 --> 00:10:12.700
when you're doing this.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:15.440
So you have to be aware of it.

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.900
So let me talk about two--

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.140
again, quote, end
quote-- "simple methods"

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:24.640
for doing concept selection.

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.400
The first one is
called Pugh matrix,

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.440
and then I'll talk
about utility analysis.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:34.520
So the Pugh matrix, essentially,
is a very discrete method.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:39.670
It uses essentially plus, zero,
and minus to score alternatives

00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:41.440
relative to a datum.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:45.950
A datum is a reference decision,
a reference architecture.

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:48.600
And this is named
after Stuart Pugh,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:55.060
who is a British professor
of design, essentially.

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.360
And it's a very simple method.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.820
And it's used extensively.

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:04.820
It does have some pitfalls, as
well, but it's very well known.

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:07.470
So Pugh matrix

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:11.830
And then the second one is
called utility analysis.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:15.670
So it essentially
maps all the criteria

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:20.440
to a dimensionless utility,
this is between zero and one.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.240
So zero is a completely
useless system.

00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.090
It has zero utility.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:28.360
And one is a system that
has perfect utility.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.010
It can't really be improved.

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:32.560
You could try to improve
it but your satisfaction

00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.960
would not increase, OK?

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:39.160
And this has very deep
mathematical theory,

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:44.360
particularly the Von
Neumann and Morgenstern

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:51.030
utility that was
basically developed

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:53.000
in the mid-twentieth century.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.420
Anybody seen the movie
A Beautiful Mind?

00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:57.920
Yeah?

00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.460
What is is A
Beautiful Mind about?

00:12:07.412 --> 00:12:09.520
AUDIENCE: It's about John--

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.510
mathematician John Nash who's
a mathematician who won--

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:18.400
I forget exactly what
prize he had won.

00:12:22.684 --> 00:12:24.100
PROFESSOR: He won
the Nobel Prize.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.475
AUDIENCE: Was it
the Nobel Prize?

00:12:25.475 --> 00:12:26.300
OK.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.550
AUDIENCE: Founded game theory.

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:28.383
PROFESSOR: For what?

00:12:28.383 --> 00:12:29.590
For game theory, right.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:33.040
And so one of
Nash's contributions

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.120
was the idea of a
Nash equilibrium.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:38.110
So we have multiple
decision makers in gaming,

00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:40.460
and the question is--

00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:42.520
you have your current
strategy, but is there

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.410
a better move you could make?

00:12:44.410 --> 00:12:47.290
And if you could make
a better move that

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:52.280
improves your satisfaction,
or your utility,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:56.590
but by doing this, you decrease
somebody else's utility,

00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:58.480
you may not go there.

00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.450
So if you reach a
Nash equilibrium,

00:13:00.450 --> 00:13:02.980
that means that everybody
believes that this

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.140
is the best they can achieve.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:06.740
And how do you measure that?

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:12.130
Well Nash actually developed
his Nash equilibrium and game

00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:18.880
theory building upon theories
of Von Neumann and Morgenstern.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.560
So there's a very
deep theory behind it.

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.450
I'm not going to go
very deep into it,

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:29.010
but so you know that there's
a lot behind utility analysis.

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:33.970
OK, so let me just talk
you through the basic steps

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:35.920
for doing a Pugh
matrix analysis.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.500
And I'll show you a
very simple example.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.290
First step, you choose
or develop the criteria

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:43.430
for comparison.

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.530
So, what's important?

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:47.470
How are we going to decide this?

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:48.610
Selection.

00:13:48.610 --> 00:13:50.140
And obviously this
should be based

00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.990
on a set of system
requirements and goals.

00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:57.710
Now, there are two
flavors of requirements.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:01.390
Remember, what-- let's
ask here at EPFL.

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:04.330
You remember the two
flavors of requirements?

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:07.921
What were the two
flavors of requirements?

00:14:07.921 --> 00:14:19.712
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:19.712 --> 00:14:21.920
PROFESSOR: I mean, there's
actually six types, right?

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.100
There's functional requirements.

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.850
There is constraints.

00:14:26.850 --> 00:14:31.360
There's interface
requirements, and so forth.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.180
What I'm trying to get at
is there are requirements

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.010
that use shall
statements and then

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:39.310
there's requirements that
use should statements, right?

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.410
So the shall
statements are what?

00:14:41.410 --> 00:14:43.195
What do the shell
statements imply?

00:14:47.304 --> 00:14:50.912
AUDIENCE: So basically, for
the shall, it's compulsory,

00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:55.180
and for should, it's
a goal of the system.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.200
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.980
Exactly.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:00.280
So, in some sense,
the shall state--

00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.520
the criteria associated
with shall statements

00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.960
don't necessarily make the best
criteria for the Pugh matrix,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.130
because by definition, the
concepts that you're evaluating

00:15:12.130 --> 00:15:14.770
should all satisfy
the shall statements.

00:15:14.770 --> 00:15:19.030
Because if they don't, they're
essentially infeasible, right?

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:23.710
And you shouldn't select
among them in the first place.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:27.430
So architectures, or
concepts, or alternatives

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:35.340
that violate shall requirements
do not satisfy the must

00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:37.120
have requirements.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.570
And you shouldn't-- so you
shouldn't use criteria that are

00:15:40.570 --> 00:15:42.610
associated with
hard constraints.

00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:44.770
That's what I'm trying to say.

00:15:44.770 --> 00:15:46.840
Now the requirements
that are associated with

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:51.400
should statements, those are
good criteria for this Pugh

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.920
matrix, because the degree
to which you satisfy this,

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:57.020
the goals are somewhat variable.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.540
Therefore, you can then
compare amongst alternatives.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:00.400
OK?

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.330
So that's number one.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:05.110
Number two-- thank
you, that was good--

00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:07.160
select the alternatives
to be compared.

00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:11.080
So that those are coming out
of concept generation and one

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:16.360
little bit tricky aspect here
is when you're putting together

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.780
the alternatives, the
concepts to be selected from,

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:21.790
they should be represented
at a similar level

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:24.070
of detail of abstraction.

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:28.840
It is not good to have one
concept that's really detailed,

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.640
and you know a lot
about it, and often it's

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.640
kind of an existing system or
something you've done before,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:38.440
and then there's this other
concept that is very fuzzy.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.560
Why shouldn't you compare
something very detailed

00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:45.820
with something very,
very poorly defined?

00:16:45.820 --> 00:16:49.090
Why do you think that's
not a good practice?

00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:50.780
What do you guys think here?

00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.050
Yes.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.440
AUDIENCE: Is it like--

00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.050
it's not fair, because--

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.050
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:16:56.050 --> 00:16:59.320
It's a fairness issue,
and because the concepts

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.550
that are poorly
defined often, you're

00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:04.060
too optimistic about them.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.560
That's sort of the typical--

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.099
this looks really
good, very promising,

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.500
but it looks very
promising because it's

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:13.319
kind of ill-defined.

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:15.319
So that's important.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.349
Try to represent
all the concepts

00:17:17.349 --> 00:17:19.510
at about the same
level of detail

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:21.010
when you make the comparison.

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:22.960
That's number two.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.440
Number three-- you actually
go through and generate

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:27.880
the scores.

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.280
And the key thing
here-- this is maybe

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.560
the most important thing
about the Pugh matrix

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.250
is you always use a datum.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.330
The datum is a reference--
one of the alternatives

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:43.220
that you're going to
compare is your reference.

00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:47.560
So what you do is you always
compare every other alternative

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.550
in the set against the datum,
and you say for each criterion

00:17:51.550 --> 00:17:53.290
is it better?

00:17:53.290 --> 00:17:55.660
Is it about the
same, or is it worse

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:59.250
than the reference, the datum?

00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:01.620
So you don't compare
all the alternatives

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.180
pairwise against each other.

00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.590
You always compare
against the datum.

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.630
Then you compute
the total scores

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:10.300
and I'll show you
this in the example,

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.110
and then there's
variations like--

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.300
rather than better,
equal, or worse,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.066
you could go to a five-point.

00:18:17.066 --> 00:18:20.030
Much better, a little
better, or about the same.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:21.980
So there are some
variations on the scoring,

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:27.804
but the classic method just
uses better, the same, or worse.

00:18:27.804 --> 00:18:28.470
So here's some--

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:30.260
AUDIENCE: Excuse
me, just a question.

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.157
PROFESSOR: Yeah, go ahead.

00:18:32.157 --> 00:18:33.740
AUDIENCE: Just about
the number three,

00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:36.270
about generic scores
and user datum--

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:39.496
by doing so, don't you exclude
a solution that could have,

00:18:39.496 --> 00:18:44.450
under the generic picture,
be better then others?

00:18:44.450 --> 00:18:47.219
PROFESSOR: What do you
mean by general picture?

00:18:47.219 --> 00:18:49.593
AUDIENCE: You should take all
the solution that you have,

00:18:49.593 --> 00:18:53.280
and at the end, one performs
slightly better than the other,

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.820
but you couldn't spot
it by using the datum?

00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:57.540
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.100
So it's a very good question.

00:19:00.100 --> 00:19:02.550
And so this is a question
of resolution right?

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:05.150
How good is your resolution?

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.380
The main purpose
of the Pugh matrix

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.160
is not for making the
final choice right away.

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.930
The main purpose
of the Pugh matrix

00:19:12.930 --> 00:19:17.750
is actually to eliminate
concepts that are--

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:23.130
you can tell already that
they're not competitive.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.640
And you don't typically
do Pugh matrix one time

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.530
and then say that's
the best one.

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:31.106
You use it, essentially,
to eliminate

00:19:31.106 --> 00:19:32.996
purely inferior solutions.

00:19:32.996 --> 00:19:33.870
Does that make sense?

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:42.500
AUDIENCE: I'm really sorry
but the video cut just

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.640
during your explanation.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:48.060
PROFESSOR: OK, so
let me repeat this.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:51.930
So the purpose of
the Pugh matrix

00:19:51.930 --> 00:19:54.750
is not to select
the final concept

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.120
as a result of doing
the Pugh matrix,

00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:00.510
but to identify
inferior concepts

00:20:00.510 --> 00:20:02.100
to eliminate them from the set.

00:20:06.270 --> 00:20:07.790
OK?

00:20:07.790 --> 00:20:08.626
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:20:08.626 --> 00:20:09.500
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.460
So here's a kind
of generic example

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.040
to explain how this works.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:20.090
So here's our Pugh matrix,
our evaluation matrix.

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.820
On the rows, we
have our criteria.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:30.680
It could be cost, performance,
resilience, effectiveness,

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.890
and so those are called
A, B, C, D, E, and F.

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.920
So we have six criteria.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.030
And then the column--

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.260
each column
represents a concept,

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:42.380
a design, an architecture.

00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.090
And so you know
we're designing--

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:46.640
I guess we're designing
beams here, or levers,

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.210
or something like that.

00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.790
So this is a solid cylinder.

00:20:49.790 --> 00:20:52.220
This is a cylinder
that's hollow.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:54.500
This is a square,
it's cross-sectioned.

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.646
This is a triangular
cross-section.

00:20:56.646 --> 00:20:57.770
You get the picture, right?

00:20:57.770 --> 00:21:01.010
There they're
qualitatively different.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:05.360
And then you note which one
is our is our reference here?

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:08.370
Which concept?

00:21:08.370 --> 00:21:09.510
Number seven, right?

00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:16.140
If you look at seven this
sort of shallow triangle.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:17.520
Seven, it says datum.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.040
You see that?

00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:21.140
Which means that
this is our baseline,

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.180
our reference, our datum.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.930
And then what you do is,
as you fill this in--

00:21:27.930 --> 00:21:29.360
and you can do it two ways.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.210
You can do-- pick, say, concept
one, the solid cylinder,

00:21:35.210 --> 00:21:39.230
and then compare it against
seven for all criteria.

00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:45.650
So A, so concept one is better
than concept seven in criterion

00:21:45.650 --> 00:21:47.150
A. So it gets a plus.

00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.820
It's also better in
B. It gets a plus.

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:55.190
It's worse in C and D, so this
is a minus compared to seven,

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.040
and so forth.

00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.850
So the two ways of
filling it in is

00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:01.820
you do concept by
concept, column-wise,

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:05.330
or you can do it row- wise.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:09.570
And there's some arguments
in favor of one or the other.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.650
But essentially, you
fill in this matrix

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:17.390
by always comparing
against number seven.

00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:19.117
Alexis, what's your question?

00:22:19.117 --> 00:22:20.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah, just a question.

00:22:20.450 --> 00:22:22.273
Shouldn't we weight
the criteria?

00:22:22.273 --> 00:22:26.890
I mean, for example, if the
criteria A is more important,

00:22:26.890 --> 00:22:28.440
shall we put more weight on it?

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.610
PROFESSOR: No.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:30.450
No.

00:22:30.450 --> 00:22:33.600
At this point, in
the Pugh matrix,

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:35.670
the criteria are unweighted.

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.410
This is very important.

00:22:37.410 --> 00:22:40.900
You don't say B is
twice as important as C.

00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:43.830
They're unweighted
when you first do this.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.320
Eventually, when you
do the final selection,

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.120
you will probably weigh them.

00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:50.710
But when you first do
this, there's no weighting.

00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:52.320
They're equal.

00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:52.930
OK?

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:53.430
Yes?

00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:54.395
Go ahead.

00:22:54.395 --> 00:22:56.520
AUDIENCE: Are there any
rules in picking your datum

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.230
or do you just pick arbitrarily?

00:22:58.230 --> 00:23:01.740
PROFESSOR: So I'll
get into that.

00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:07.040
It should be a design that
you think is competitive,

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.140
that [INAUDIBLE]
maybe you know it,

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.110
maybe it's an existing
sort of system,

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:16.614
there's data on it,
a known quantity.

00:23:16.614 --> 00:23:18.030
But if you don't
have if you don't

00:23:18.030 --> 00:23:20.020
have any information,
if they're all equal,

00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.320
then it's a random choice.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:22.980
OK?

00:23:22.980 --> 00:23:26.670
So, then once you've
filled in this matrix--

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.190
so S here is for same, right?

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:30.510
About the same.

00:23:30.510 --> 00:23:33.465
Then you essentially
sum all the pluses,

00:23:33.465 --> 00:23:36.600
you sum all the
minuses, and then

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:39.820
you have the net
result, unweighted.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:40.320
Right?

00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.650
So, here you can
essentially compare

00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:47.820
that, you can see that
concept one is better in three

00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:51.900
and worse in three
than the datum.

00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:57.810
You can see that concept
two is inferior in three

00:23:57.810 --> 00:24:01.180
criteria, better in two,
and the same in one.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.180
But we're not actually summing.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.980
We're not actually
summing at this point,

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.260
because we're not
weighting these, OK?

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:11.310
But it gives you a
basis of understanding.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:16.050
OK so let's do a quick
partner exercise.

00:24:16.050 --> 00:24:18.240
What do you see as
the main advantages

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.960
and potential disadvantages
or pitfalls of this method?

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.030
So turn to your partner,
discuss this for a few minutes,

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:29.316
and then we'll see
what you came up with.

00:24:29.316 --> 00:24:31.220
[MICROPHONE NOISE]

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:54.900
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.790
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.289
Good.

00:24:56.289 --> 00:24:59.380
So let's see advantages.

00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.020
Let's get a couple
here, and then we'll

00:25:01.020 --> 00:25:03.570
sort of go back and forth
between here and EPFL.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.700
So what are-- what's
good about this method?

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:11.099
Yes, go ahead.

00:25:11.099 --> 00:25:12.640
AUDIENCE: So, Nate
and I were talking

00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.600
that it is a relatively simple
decision making process.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.380
So instead of just going with
some sort of gut feeling,

00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:22.830
or not looking at everything,
you can get stuff down on paper

00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:25.017
and actually see
these criteria and how

00:25:25.017 --> 00:25:26.100
they relate to each other.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:26.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:28.050
So simplicity.

00:25:28.050 --> 00:25:28.945
What else?

00:25:28.945 --> 00:25:30.430
Go ahead, Sam.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:34.320
AUDIENCE: It allows you to look
at a large array of concepts

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:36.050
very quickly.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:39.580
PROFESSOR: OK large samples.

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:45.918
Sorry.

00:25:45.918 --> 00:25:46.530
Quick, right?

00:25:46.530 --> 00:25:47.620
You said quick.

00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:48.120
.

00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:49.140
OK.

00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:52.090
What advantages, EPFL, what
did you guys come up with?

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:54.375
So simple, it allows us to
look at a lot of concepts.

00:25:54.375 --> 00:25:55.810
It's quick.

00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:56.310
What else?

00:25:59.585 --> 00:26:03.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] we got
[INAUDIBLE] the same things.

00:26:03.310 --> 00:26:08.795
This method is simple, and
it's pretty fast and pretty

00:26:08.795 --> 00:26:09.670
straightforward, too.

00:26:09.670 --> 00:26:16.281
So this is a good way to get
rid of some of the concepts

00:26:16.281 --> 00:26:16.780
pretty fast.

00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:17.410
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:26:17.410 --> 00:26:22.150
Anything else that we
didn't [INAUDIBLE]??

00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.460
There's one more that I would
like to put on this list.

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:26.524
Veronica, go ahead.

00:26:26.524 --> 00:26:27.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:29.510
PROFESSOR: Qualitative.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:39.140
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I kind of
like [INAUDIBLE] improvements,

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:44.060
rather than this is better
because the requirement is--

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.030
AUDIENCE: Please put
on the microphone.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.960
PROFESSOR: I think-- can you
just quickly repeat that?

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:51.860
AUDIENCE: Just that
it's qualitative.

00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:54.380
PROFESSOR: And that you see
that as an advantage, actually.

00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.870
AUDIENCE: I think you
can see it both ways.

00:26:55.870 --> 00:26:56.700
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:26:56.700 --> 00:27:00.870
So I think what you implied
with is it stimulates

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:02.802
the discussion, right?

00:27:02.802 --> 00:27:03.907
Stimulates debate.

00:27:03.907 --> 00:27:08.176
AUDIENCE: There may be another
criterion on the positive side.

00:27:08.176 --> 00:27:09.713
PROFESSOR: Go ahead.

00:27:09.713 --> 00:27:14.100
AUDIENCE: And it would be that
it's extremely easy to explain

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.003
to [INAUDIBLE],, to [INAUDIBLE],,
to whoever your customer is,

00:27:18.003 --> 00:27:19.895
because-- and they
can relate to it.

00:27:19.895 --> 00:27:24.090
If the criteria are mostly
physical or scientific, I mean,

00:27:24.090 --> 00:27:27.480
larger, stronger,
lighter, cheaper,

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.750
it's probably very
intuitive, yes, as I say.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:32.330
PROFESSOR: OK, great.

00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:34.180
Now, downsides.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:37.510
What are the downsides
of the method?

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:39.390
Go ahead.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.060
Make sure you--

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:43.690
AUDIENCE: I think it
definitely depends

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.210
on which you pick as a datum.

00:27:46.210 --> 00:27:48.869
Like, if you pick the clearly
best one as the datum,

00:27:48.869 --> 00:27:50.910
then it's not going to
give you much information.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.955
Or if you pick the worst one
as the datum, then all of them

00:27:53.955 --> 00:27:54.580
will be better.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.670
And you kind of don't
really gain much information

00:27:57.670 --> 00:27:58.430
from that.

00:27:58.430 --> 00:28:01.305
So you have to like iterate
with different datums.

00:28:01.305 --> 00:28:01.930
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:03.610
There's actually
research on this.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:06.820
There's some research-- this
matrix, this Pugh matrix

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:09.580
method, by the way,
has been studied

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:11.300
scientifically quite a bit.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.910
There's quite a
literature on it.

00:28:12.910 --> 00:28:16.370
And the point that you
brought up was studied.

00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.550
They would basically
give the same criteria

00:28:18.550 --> 00:28:21.460
and the same alternatives to
different groups of people,

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.880
but then give them
a different datum.

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.130
And it's a little tricky--
is the result different

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.870
because it's a
different group dynamic?

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.690
Or is it-- but this has
been done statistically,

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:37.300
and the choice of datum has
an impact on the outcome.

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:38.320
Very good.

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.450
That's actually a
pretty subtle point.

00:28:40.450 --> 00:28:42.010
That was excellent.

00:28:42.010 --> 00:28:44.830
What are some other--
yes, please go ahead.

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.140
AUDIENCE: While it's
very easy to implement

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:50.510
and anyone can do it,
it is very subjective.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.200
So if you have
somebody that doesn't

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.820
have a whole lot of
experience in a certain area,

00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.290
they may get a completely
different answer

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:02.592
than somebody who
is an expert looking

00:29:02.592 --> 00:29:03.800
at the same type of criteria.

00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:08.070
PROFESSOR: Subjectivity-- which
basically, repeatability--

00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.340
may be low, right?

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:11.890
You want to have robustness
of the methods such

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.590
that if you repeated
this multiple times

00:29:14.590 --> 00:29:17.020
or you gave it to
different groups of people,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.230
you want to have some confidence
that the results will come up

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:21.250
similarly.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:22.510
Very good.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:25.900
Let's see at EPFL,
any downsides?

00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.680
So datum dependent, subjective--

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:31.366
what else?

00:29:31.366 --> 00:29:32.740
AUDIENCE: So what
we are thinking

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:38.910
is that the criteria
depend, from group to group.

00:29:38.910 --> 00:29:41.490
It doesn't seem to be clearly
defined what you need.

00:29:41.490 --> 00:29:44.260
Although, there are some
that are straightforward

00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.319
and our other point--

00:29:47.319 --> 00:29:48.444
AUDIENCE: Datum dependence?

00:29:48.444 --> 00:29:49.110
That's what we--

00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:52.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
datum dependence.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:58.750
If it was a very easy solution,
or if a very bad solution

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.020
as a reference, then all
the others look good.

00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:04.440
And finally, if you have a--

00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:07.850
if you judge on the
overall concept,

00:30:07.850 --> 00:30:10.640
and maybe you discard
one or two solutions,

00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:14.620
but inside those
concepts you have ideas

00:30:14.620 --> 00:30:22.120
that you could keep or use,
then they might be lost.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.600
PROFESSOR: OK, so
loss of sub-concepts.

00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:26.760
OK.

00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.360
Good.

00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:28.690
Anything else here?

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.207
Mike.

00:30:30.207 --> 00:30:32.290
AUDIENCE: We were talking
about how it's very easy

00:30:32.290 --> 00:30:35.110
to tune your metrics to be--

00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:36.022
like to be biased.

00:30:36.022 --> 00:30:36.730
PROFESSOR: I see.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:38.980
Such gaming, right?

00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:41.020
Gaming-- gaming the--

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.640
basically producing a matrix to
give you the answer you want,

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.510
that you already had
preordained, sort of.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.010
Right?

00:30:48.010 --> 00:30:50.450
That essentially
what you're saying.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:50.950
.

00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:52.230
OK.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.790
Very good.

00:30:52.790 --> 00:30:54.250
So these are all--

00:30:54.250 --> 00:30:54.750
go ahead.

00:30:57.306 --> 00:30:59.610
AUDIENCE: Just sort of
one last disadvantage

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:02.880
of the method that I think
is a bit interesting,

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:06.510
because I think the way
of grading everything with

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:09.330
plus or minus can be
[INAUDIBLE],, because you can

00:31:09.330 --> 00:31:13.892
imagine a system, for instance,
that is very, very good in one

00:31:13.892 --> 00:31:17.550
criteria, and then pretty
bad in all the others,

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:19.930
and it could be a
good concept that

00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:22.410
is disregarded nonetheless.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:25.050
PROFESSOR: What's your name?

00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:25.800
AUDIENCE: Bastian.

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:28.536
PROFESSOR: Pasqual?

00:31:28.536 --> 00:31:29.490
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

00:31:29.490 --> 00:31:30.281
PROFESSOR: Pasqual.

00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:31.365
Is your name Pasqual?

00:31:31.365 --> 00:31:32.115
AUDIENCE: Bastian.

00:31:32.115 --> 00:31:33.265
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:33.265 --> 00:31:34.690
AUDIENCE: Bastian.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.860
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.810
Keep that point
until-- we're going

00:31:38.810 --> 00:31:42.320
to talk about exactly that point
when it comes to non-dominance,

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:43.430
OK?

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:47.060
So please reserve--
this is great.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:50.420
Just, we'll come back to
that in a few minutes, OK?

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:52.790
All right, so this is great.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.710
I think you really got it.

00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:58.310
This is exact-- this
is a very good list.

00:31:58.310 --> 00:32:01.820
So, you may say well, OK
this is good for beams

00:32:01.820 --> 00:32:03.780
and you know very simple things.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:05.600
So, I want to show
you an example

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.080
of an application of the Pugh
matrix to what I would argue

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:13.670
is a fairly complex
architectural decision.

00:32:13.670 --> 00:32:16.820
And what I'll talk to
you about is a thesis

00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:21.900
that was done here at MIT
in 2003, so a while ago,

00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:24.950
12 years ago, by Brian Smith.

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:30.020
He was an STM student, and was
one of the easiest students

00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.460
ever to advise.

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:36.230
Very knowledgeable in nuclear
propulsion and nuclear power.

00:32:36.230 --> 00:32:39.710
He's now the branch chief
for nuclear power propulsion

00:32:39.710 --> 00:32:43.670
at NASA Glenn research
center in Ohio.

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:46.790
And so, at the time,
NASA had a mission

00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:50.420
that was kind of high
priority called JIMO--

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.790
Jupiter icy moons mission.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.730
And when you go out
to Jupiter, and you

00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:57.950
want to not just do a
fly by but you actually

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.990
want to go to
different orbits, you

00:32:59.990 --> 00:33:03.240
want to do high power imaging,
you need a lot of power.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.050
You're far from the sun.

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:08.870
RTG's only give you 100
watts or so, per RTG.

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:12.777
So nuclear power is
pretty much the way to go.

00:33:12.777 --> 00:33:14.360
But there's a lot
of different choices

00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.640
of different nuclear
reactor architectures

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:18.770
that would potentially--

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:21.320
and then couple that with
the propulsion system.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:26.830
So that was the challenge was
sifting through the large space

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:29.680
of possibility for
nuclear electric power,

00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.620
nuclear exploration class
electric power and propulsion

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:33.700
systems.

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.350
And you know, here's the
way the study was set up

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.900
is the expansion phase,
the filtering, and then

00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:43.620
the screening phase.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:47.310
So here's the architectural
space the way it was defined.

00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:51.480
So nuclear electric power and
propulsion is what we're after.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.070
And there's different ways to
generate these alternatives.

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.690
So the most important
is the design vector,

00:33:57.690 --> 00:34:00.200
the type of reactor, the
operating temperature,

00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:02.780
the power conversion scheme,
the heat exchange, and then

00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:04.340
the fuel type.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:06.790
And then there
were requirements.

00:34:06.790 --> 00:34:10.040
So this is the power range,
the delivery timeline,

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:13.070
the fact that you should be able
to do it in a single launch,

00:34:13.070 --> 00:34:15.630
and then the operational
lifetime of the system.

00:34:15.630 --> 00:34:17.580
So those are the
shall requirements.

00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:20.989
Every architecture had to meet
these requirements otherwise

00:34:20.989 --> 00:34:22.550
it would not be considered.

00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:25.174
And then there were some things
that were assumed as constants.

00:34:25.174 --> 00:34:27.110
They're shown here.

00:34:27.110 --> 00:34:28.940
There was a policy
vector in terms

00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.909
of funding profiles,
international partnerships,

00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:36.260
at what altitude you could
insert the system into orbit,

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:38.030
and then influence
on future missions.

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:41.730
And the objective vector is
the criteria for the decision.

00:34:41.730 --> 00:34:45.080
Technology-- TRL is
Technology Readiness Level.

00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.800
How much infrastructure
do you need?

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.659
Complexity.

00:34:47.659 --> 00:34:49.900
Strategic value to the nation.

00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:53.100
This is a little fuzzy, but
basically what this means is,

00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.250
could you use it for
other applications

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:57.580
than exploring Jupiter?

00:34:57.580 --> 00:34:58.220
The schedule.

00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.431
The launch packaging.

00:34:59.431 --> 00:34:59.930
Power.

00:34:59.930 --> 00:35:04.710
Specific mass, which
is watts per kilogram.

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.870
The lifetime.

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:09.680
So it's interesting you
have lifetime here and here.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:13.040
So there's a minimum lifetime,
right, and if you satisfy this,

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:15.380
the extra life you
get can actually

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:17.750
be used as a decision criteria.

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:19.480
How does it interact
with the payload?

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.410
Do you need a lot of shielding?

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:22.730
And then adaptability?

00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:24.510
Can you adapt it for
different missions?

00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:25.010
Yeah?

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:30.051
AUDIENCE: In the previous
slide, it listed both possible--

00:35:30.051 --> 00:35:33.370
on the previous slide, we had
both possible and feasible

00:35:33.370 --> 00:35:37.410
on there as different
kind of criteria.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:39.630
What do you have for a
difference for those?

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:42.990
PROFESSOR: So essentially,
possible is, this

00:35:42.990 --> 00:35:45.480
is sort of the
combinatorial space.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:49.940
And then, applying
the hard constraints

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.640
based on the requirements
vector gets you

00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:55.300
from possible to feasible.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:57.920
They satisfy your must
have requirements,

00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:59.960
your shall requirements,
and then you

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:03.700
use, in screening, you
use the objective vector--

00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:10.120
these criteria-- you use
to go from here to here.

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.870
So let me show you
what this looks like,

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:15.210
and I'll post this thesis,
if you're interested.

00:36:15.210 --> 00:36:20.110
It's really-- the whole thesis
is about doing this process.

00:36:20.110 --> 00:36:21.600
So here we have--

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:25.470
each column represents a
different reactor architecture.

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:28.450
So you can see in the legend
what these things mean.

00:36:28.450 --> 00:36:35.610
So for the reactor type, we
have a liquid metal, gas cooled,

00:36:35.610 --> 00:36:38.670
or heat pipe type reactor.

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:42.360
These are three types of
nuclear fission reactors.

00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:45.940
For fuel, we have two types of
fuel, if I remember correctly.

00:36:45.940 --> 00:36:48.810
We have UO2 or UN.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.080
For the temperature at which
the reactor would be run,

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:54.390
we have medium or high.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:57.870
For the conversion-- this
is the thermodynamics.

00:36:57.870 --> 00:37:00.450
How do you get the heat
out of the reactor?

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:03.960
We have a Brayton
or a Rankine cycle,

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:08.070
or a thermoelectric
reactor, which is basically

00:37:08.070 --> 00:37:11.190
directly converting
the heat to electricity

00:37:11.190 --> 00:37:13.710
without a working fluid.

00:37:13.710 --> 00:37:20.820
And then, D is the heat
exchange architecture, which

00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:23.190
is either direct or indirect.

00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:26.100
And so you can see that
each of these columns

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:29.490
represents a different
kind of architecture,

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.940
and they're colored here by--

00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:42.330
the dark is a direct heat pipe
with liquid metal reactor,

00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:44.040
and so forth.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:47.640
So that's essentially--
what you're seeing here

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.540
is the filtered set that
is deemed to be feasible.

00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.430
Potentially feasible.

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:57.870
And then the actual screening
is done based on this.

00:37:57.870 --> 00:38:00.790
So this is the actual
Pugh matrix here.

00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:04.420
So we have the
concept combinations,

00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.040
which are the columns.

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.150
The datum here is the one
that's shaded in gray.

00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:13.350
So it's a liquid metal
reactor with a thermal--

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:16.770
it's a liquid metal
thermoelectric reactor

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:21.570
with indirect heat exchange, UN
fuel type and a high operating

00:38:21.570 --> 00:38:22.950
temperature.

00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:25.230
And why was this chosen?

00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:30.000
Well if you look here,
it says SP100 reference.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.450
So the US actually has
launched-- at least,

00:38:33.450 --> 00:38:35.760
officially, as far as we know--

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.270
one nuclear reactor into
space, and that's the SP100.

00:38:39.270 --> 00:38:41.070
You can look it up.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:43.180
There's a history behind it.

00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:46.950
And that's the
architecture of the SP100.

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:48.450
So it was launched.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:49.680
We had data on it.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.510
It's a known quantity.

00:38:51.510 --> 00:38:53.580
The Russians, it turns out--

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.730
Russia has launched a
lot of nuclear reactors

00:38:56.730 --> 00:38:58.550
over the years.

00:38:58.550 --> 00:39:01.500
But this is sort
of the US baseline,

00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:03.640
if you want to call it that.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.880
And then all of these
other combinations

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:10.680
are compared against the
SP100, the reference reactor.

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:17.020
And so, you can see here that
the comparison is drawn again.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.200
So zero means it's about--

00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.440
so for TRL, it means it's
about equally mature.

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.140
A plus means it's
actually more mature.

00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:30.720
A negative means it's less
mature than the SP100.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:34.000
And at the end of
this, you can actually

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.620
look at the total pluses
and zeros and minuses,

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.260
and then in this
case, what Brian did,

00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:42.600
he did calculate a net score.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.130
That's an unweighted score.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:48.510
Basically, if you give
one point-- so let's

00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:50.020
look at the first one.

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:53.260
So it has four pluses, right?

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:58.240
It has four pluses, and it
has five equal to the SP100,

00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:00.350
to the datum, and has two minus.

00:40:00.350 --> 00:40:03.340
So it's worse than two,
better in four criteria,

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:04.840
and the same in five.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:07.630
So the net score
would be plus two,

00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:11.770
because it's better
in two criteria, net.

00:40:11.770 --> 00:40:13.690
But it's unweighted.

00:40:13.690 --> 00:40:17.980
And so in order to
figure out what--

00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:21.880
based on this net score,
so a zero net score

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.600
would say it's about
equal to the datum,

00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:27.440
but it maybe in other,
different criteria.

00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:30.620
But essentially
it's about the same.

00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:35.080
If it's a plus two, then
it is potentially better

00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:36.310
than the SP100.

00:40:36.310 --> 00:40:38.230
But you don't know
that 100%, because you

00:40:38.230 --> 00:40:39.640
haven't weighted the criteria.

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:42.010
It's really used for screening.

00:40:42.010 --> 00:40:47.950
So the ones that are circled
are better, essentially,

00:40:47.950 --> 00:40:49.930
than the datum.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:51.710
And the ones that are--

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:53.410
this is-- I'm sorry, the rank.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:54.970
This is the rank among the set.

00:40:54.970 --> 00:40:59.290
So if you have a one here,
you're in the rank one.

00:40:59.290 --> 00:41:03.490
And there's two architectures,
the first two are rank one.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.050
And then we have
this architecture,

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:06.370
which is ranked two.

00:41:06.370 --> 00:41:10.300
The datum itself, plus two other
architectures, are rank three.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.800
And then you see
that there's some--

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:14.260
like, for example,
this architecture here

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.580
is rank eight, right?

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.350
So it-- why is that?

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:20.350
Because it's not better in
any criteria than the datum.

00:41:20.350 --> 00:41:21.910
It's the same in six.

00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.840
And it's worse in five, right?

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:26.980
So that gives you an indication
that this particular concept

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:32.570
probably is not very attractive,
and you would eliminate that.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:33.640
OK?

00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:40.090
So that's essentially an
application of the Pugh matrix

00:41:40.090 --> 00:41:45.170
to a pretty real-world,
complex problem.

00:41:45.170 --> 00:41:49.150
So what the Pugh matrix is for
is essentially structured--

00:41:49.150 --> 00:41:52.060
structuring and representing
the evaluation procedure.

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.130
It serves as a common visual.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.530
It provides some
amount of discipline,

00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.470
and helps break down
self-sealing behavior,

00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:00.520
meaning--

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:03.100
what that means is people
defending their concepts

00:42:03.100 --> 00:42:05.500
without sort of seeing
the bigger picture.

00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:07.130
Encourages teamwork.

00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:09.370
It helps you eliminate
weaker ideas,

00:42:09.370 --> 00:42:11.950
retain a set of
stronger concepts.

00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:14.000
And then this is
interesting-- divergence.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.260
It helps to identify
opportunities for combination.

00:42:17.260 --> 00:42:20.300
There's also a way to
use this Pugh matrix

00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:22.301
methods multiple times.

00:42:22.301 --> 00:42:23.800
And the way you
would do this is you

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.880
would say, OK so these are the
stronger concepts here, right?

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.670
The ones that do equally
well or maybe even

00:42:30.670 --> 00:42:32.550
a little better than the datum.

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:35.200
What are the strengths and
weaknesses of each concept

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:37.210
and can we hybridize them?

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:40.330
Can we create some
hybrid concepts?

00:42:40.330 --> 00:42:43.930
And so you eliminate
the weaker ones.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:47.770
The surviving concepts are
kept, and then maybe hybridized

00:42:47.770 --> 00:42:48.700
with each other.

00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.000
So you expand and create
more concepts again.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.560
Maybe a little
bit more detailed.

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.020
And then you apply
the Pugh matrix again.

00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:00.220
So it's iterative application
of the Pugh matrix, where

00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:04.570
you eliminate, you keep strong
concepts, you hybridize them,

00:43:04.570 --> 00:43:06.790
and then you repeat
it two or three times.

00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:08.800
And there's actually
research on this, as well.

00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:11.140
Professor Dan Frye,
who is here at MIT

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:14.260
in mechanical engineering,
has done research on that

00:43:14.260 --> 00:43:18.050
and shown that that can actually
lead to very good outcomes.

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:19.870
So this sort of gradual--

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:23.740
so then, you don't have just
one expansion and contraction

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:28.060
of your concept space, but it
sort of goes multiple times.

00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.960
But eventually it does converge.

00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:33.700
So this is a more refined
application of the method.

00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:38.650
What Pugh matrix is not good for
is automatic decision-making,

00:43:38.650 --> 00:43:40.390
right?

00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:42.310
Completely controlling
the process.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:47.810
So, you know, the idea of
automating the Pugh matrix--

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:49.660
it should not be automatic.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.460
And it's not really
done-- it's not

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:55.100
really good for trade studies.

00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:58.460
Challenges-- [LAUGHS]
so here's some quotes.

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:00.350
"People who have a
lot of experience

00:44:00.350 --> 00:44:02.630
exhibit an impatience.

00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.880
Get on with it.

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.800
This procedure holds us back."

00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:07.430
Right?

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:10.160
"Strong-willed individuals
who have a lot of experience

00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:13.310
and whose initial concepts
have not emerged in the final

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:18.260
selection commence a defense
based on emotion, experience,

00:44:18.260 --> 00:44:19.120
and bluster."

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:19.620
Right?

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:23.360
So there's this social dynamics
that gets unfolded here.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.540
So, therefore, it is
recommended to do Pugh matrix

00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.980
with a facilitator.

00:44:27.980 --> 00:44:31.820
Somebody who-- similar
to brainstorming, right,

00:44:31.820 --> 00:44:33.720
where you have a facilitator.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.230
So you have a facilitator
for Pugh matrix.

00:44:36.230 --> 00:44:38.300
So somebody who controls
the flow and pace

00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:40.910
of the session,
records the results,

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:44.120
tries to maintain
some discipline.

00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.890
Always compare
against the datum.

00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:50.000
I've seen Pugh matrix sessions
where you start with the datum,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.770
and then by the third
or fourth concept,

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:54.470
people are starting to
do pairwise comparisons,

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:56.630
and the datum is sort of lost.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:59.210
That should not happen, right?

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:02.450
Preventing tangents, but
encourage clarification.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:05.000
What do we really
mean by criteria?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.180
Clarification of the concepts,
and then opportunities

00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:11.760
for divergence in hybrids.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:14.319
So the critique
of the method is--

00:45:14.319 --> 00:45:16.610
I think a lot of these things
you've already mentioned.

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:19.220
The ranking depends on
the choice of datum.

00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:20.240
The weighting.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.860
You know, there's
no real weighting

00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.390
in the classic method.

00:45:24.390 --> 00:45:26.931
However, you can implement a
weighted version of the Pugh

00:45:26.931 --> 00:45:29.180
method, but then you have
to have the whole discussion

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:33.350
about the weightings, a priori.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:36.500
Next, I'm going to talk about
multi-attribute utility.

00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.760
And so Pugh matrix and
multi-attribute utility

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.010
could give you a different
rank order of alternatives.

00:45:42.010 --> 00:45:45.110
So how do you reconcile that?

00:45:45.110 --> 00:45:48.080
The most important criteria
may be intangible and missing

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:49.650
from the list.

00:45:49.650 --> 00:45:52.670
And my personal opinion on
this is that the Pugh matrix

00:45:52.670 --> 00:45:54.840
is useful and simple to use.

00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.700
It stimulates discussion about
the criteria, the alternatives,

00:45:58.700 --> 00:46:02.480
but it shouldn't be your only
means of concept selection.

00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:04.250
But it's usually one
of the first things

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:07.860
you should do because you
learn a lot from doing it.

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:08.720
OK?

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:12.920
Any questions about
matrix before I move on?

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:14.690
Yes, Sam?

00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.130
AUDIENCE: Should
it always be done

00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:20.450
with a group that's working
together and discussing

00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:21.110
the concepts?

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:24.410
Or could you also have
people individually

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:27.170
filling them out and then
combining their results?

00:46:27.170 --> 00:46:30.650
PROFESSOR: So yeah, usually
you do it as a group

00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:33.410
because in the discussion
with the group,

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:36.140
there's a lot of
clarification that happens.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:40.550
Now if you do it separately,
and you firewall people

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:43.550
from each other and have people
do this individually and then

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:48.140
try to combine the results
later, that's actually called--

00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:52.606
that's closer to a method
called the Delphi method.

00:46:52.606 --> 00:46:54.230
Which I'm not going
to talk about here.

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:56.490
But the Delphi
method means you're

00:46:56.490 --> 00:47:01.070
asking these kinds of
questions to experts.

00:47:01.070 --> 00:47:04.520
They give you the answers, and
then you anonymize the answers

00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:08.210
and reflect the combined
answers back to the group.

00:47:08.210 --> 00:47:11.720
And then you eliminate
the social dynamics,

00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:15.590
and you can see whether was
my assessment an outlier,

00:47:15.590 --> 00:47:17.690
am I close to the
center of the group?

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.550
So the Delphi method
has a lot of benefits,

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:22.130
but it's not usually--

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:24.680
you don't have
the social dynamic

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.370
in the same way, which is sort
of essential to make this work.

00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:29.900
Good question though.

00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:33.510
Any questions at EPFL about
Pugh matrix before I move on?

00:47:36.688 --> 00:47:37.823
AUDIENCE: No, it's clear.

00:47:37.823 --> 00:47:38.470
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:47:38.470 --> 00:47:39.970
Go ahead.

00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:44.000
AUDIENCE: It is useful to almost
have an independent group do

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.880
this, as opposed to everyone
generates their ideas

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:52.050
and then everyone's trying
to fill out the matrix so

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:53.510
that their idea wins.

00:47:53.510 --> 00:47:56.780
PROFESSOR: Usually not,
because if you give it

00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.120
to an independent
group, they'd know

00:47:59.120 --> 00:48:00.410
much less about the problem.

00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:04.190
They probably weren't involved
in generating the alternatives,

00:48:04.190 --> 00:48:07.100
they weren't involved in
selecting the criteria.

00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:09.380
They're probably not
as knowledgeable.

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:13.850
And so there is an advantage
of doing it within the team.

00:48:13.850 --> 00:48:16.370
But then, you know, before
you actually go and pull

00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:18.440
the trigger on the
final-- that's the PDR.

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.620
You get vetted by
independent people.

00:48:21.620 --> 00:48:24.300
That's what happens at the PDR.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:25.325
OK.

00:48:25.325 --> 00:48:29.750
AUDIENCE: One point here is that
you can invite external people

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:31.130
to join your discussion.

00:48:31.130 --> 00:48:32.980
So you have your design team.

00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:35.508
And it's very good to
have the experts to come,

00:48:35.508 --> 00:48:38.300
sit in the meeting, and
then give their opinion,

00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:40.264
and with the Pugh
matrix, as it's

00:48:40.264 --> 00:48:41.680
pretty straightforward
and simple,

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.820
you probably shouldn't
then bias the result,

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.487
but you could
probably enrich it.

00:48:45.487 --> 00:48:46.820
PROFESSOR: That's a great point.

00:48:46.820 --> 00:48:48.560
I agree with that, [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:49.160
Absolutely.

00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:50.360
Yeah.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:50.960
OK.

00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:54.860
So let's switch gears
to utility theory

00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:57.080
or multi-attribute
utility theory.

00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.710
So what's that all about?

00:48:58.710 --> 00:49:02.870
So like I said, utility is
a very deeply rooted concept

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:04.610
in economics.

00:49:04.610 --> 00:49:07.190
And so it's defined
as, "Utility is

00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:11.060
a measure of relative
happiness, or satisfaction,

00:49:11.060 --> 00:49:15.140
or gratification gained by
consuming different bundles

00:49:15.140 --> 00:49:16.470
of goods and services."

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.470
This is sort of
economic-- very--

00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:21.560
this is how economists talk.

00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.040
So it's-- the idea is you
want to choose a concept

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:28.220
or alternative that will
maximize your happiness,

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:31.530
your satisfaction,
your gratification.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:36.620
And whenever you buy something,
when you go to Anna's Taqueria,

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:39.500
or wherever you guys have
lunch, or at EPFL you

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:43.430
go to the Rowlock center,
and you pick from the menu,

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:46.160
you're actually doing
just that, right?

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.400
You have-- how much money
do I have in my pocket?

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:52.370
How hungry am I?

00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:54.020
Am I a vegetarian or not?

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.440
That would filter out some
menu items right away, right?

00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.720
And you pick, every day.

00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:01.340
You pick your lunch.

00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.249
Well, you're doing exactly this.

00:50:03.249 --> 00:50:05.040
You don't really know
that you're doing it,

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:09.020
but in your mind, as you're
picking from the menu,

00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:10.880
and then making
your choice, you're

00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.540
maximizing your
utility at that moment.

00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:16.410
So we do this every day.

00:50:16.410 --> 00:50:20.000
Here, in this class,
we talk about designing

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.920
complex systems.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:25.160
So we need to do it a little
bit more deliberately,

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:28.110
but this is not just
some abstract thing.

00:50:28.110 --> 00:50:30.750
We do this every day.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:34.700
And so the idea is, essentially,
we have this Consumption Set

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.040
X, which are our
alternatives-- mutually

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.080
exclusive alternatives--
and then we

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:41.870
map that to the real scale.

00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:44.120
We rank each member of
the Consumption Set.

00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:48.110
So we map the alternatives
on this utility scale.

00:50:48.110 --> 00:50:52.130
In this case, the cardinal
scale between zero and one.

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.690
So, the way this
is done, in order

00:50:54.690 --> 00:51:00.060
to do the mapping from
the criteria to utility,

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.190
you need these
mapping functions.

00:51:02.190 --> 00:51:04.350
And we call these
utility functions.

00:51:04.350 --> 00:51:06.180
They're called
utility functions.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.300
So basically we have--

00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:12.390
I'm going to use J here for--

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:17.040
J means, essentially, your
attribute, your objective.

00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.290
And then U is your utility.

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:23.040
And so there are different
shapes of utility functions.

00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:25.750
And different scholars
call them differently.

00:51:25.750 --> 00:51:27.180
So this is Cook.

00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:30.080
He says, this is smaller is
better, or larger is better.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.940
And you see they're essentially
monotonically increasing

00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.770
or decreasing curves.

00:51:34.770 --> 00:51:39.450
Messac, another scholar
in multi objective design,

00:51:39.450 --> 00:51:42.570
calls this class 1S, class 2S.

00:51:42.570 --> 00:51:47.070
So what would be an
example of a smaller

00:51:47.070 --> 00:51:49.024
is better utility function?

00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:54.300
What would be an
example of that?

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:54.800
Go ahead.

00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:01.260
AUDIENCE: An example would be
the weight of a launch vehicle.

00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:03.026
It's decreasing.

00:52:03.026 --> 00:52:04.150
PROFESSOR: The launch mass?

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:04.560
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:04.920
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:05.510
Launch mass.

00:52:05.510 --> 00:52:06.720
OK.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:07.980
What about EPFL?

00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:09.100
Smaller is better.

00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:14.780
AUDIENCE: Cost.

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:16.120
PROFESSOR: Cost, right.

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.250
So, larger is better?

00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:27.910
AUDIENCE: Revenue.

00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:29.530
PROFESSOR: Revenue.

00:52:29.530 --> 00:52:36.270
Maybe range, endurance,
reliability, right?

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:40.020
Then there's-- the next one is
strictly concave or strictly

00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.660
convex, which is
nominal is better.

00:52:42.660 --> 00:52:46.640
So the idea there is
there's a sweet spot, right?

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.350
You want the performance
or the attribute

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:53.160
to be a pretty specific
value, and if you

00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:58.200
deviate from that on
the up or down side then

00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:00.180
the utility decreases.

00:53:00.180 --> 00:53:03.660
So what would be
an example of that?

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:05.310
AUDIENCE: Size of a meal.

00:53:05.310 --> 00:53:06.990
PROFESSOR: Size of a meal, OK?

00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:10.410
Well, some restaurants
may beg to differ, right?

00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:11.178
All you can eat.

00:53:11.178 --> 00:53:11.677
[LAUGHS]

00:53:11.677 --> 00:53:12.591
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
what their objective is.

00:53:12.591 --> 00:53:13.410
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:14.310
All right.

00:53:14.310 --> 00:53:14.910
Very good.

00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:15.409
Yes, Sam?

00:53:15.409 --> 00:53:17.229
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
has to interface

00:53:17.229 --> 00:53:20.043
with something else
[INAUDIBLE] you're not

00:53:20.043 --> 00:53:22.860
[INAUDIBLE] it [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.740
PROFESSOR: Yup, so if there
is a very specific interface

00:53:25.740 --> 00:53:26.360
condition.

00:53:26.360 --> 00:53:27.090
Yeah.

00:53:27.090 --> 00:53:29.240
OK, go ahead at EPFL.

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.640
Nominal is better.

00:53:32.640 --> 00:53:34.790
AUDIENCE: Like, for example,
ambient temperature.

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:35.456
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:53:35.456 --> 00:53:37.920
So temperature-- ambient
temperature, right?

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:41.580
Humans are pretty-- we have
a fairly narrow range where

00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:43.110
we say, this is good.

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:45.150
Now we can put on a sweater or--

00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:47.500
but it's a fairly narrow range.

00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.650
So, great example.

00:53:49.650 --> 00:53:52.770
Then the next one
is range is better,

00:53:52.770 --> 00:53:55.090
which is concave or convex.

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:59.670
So this is the idea that as long
as you're within this interval,

00:53:59.670 --> 00:54:03.260
within the interval itself,
you're sort of indifferent.

00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:03.760
Right?

00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:06.160
But then when you drop
outside the interval,

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:09.280
then utility decreases
or increases.

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.270
And then the last one is very
exotic-- non-monotonic utility

00:54:13.270 --> 00:54:15.520
functions that have
multiple peaks.

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.340
They exist in theory, but in
practice, you almost never

00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:19.840
see them.

00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.290
I can't give you a good
example of multi-modal one.

00:54:23.290 --> 00:54:26.754
But in theory they do exist.

00:54:26.754 --> 00:54:29.214
AUDIENCE: Well, there
is one, and it's clearly

00:54:29.214 --> 00:54:30.805
the landing sites on a planet.

00:54:30.805 --> 00:54:32.200
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:35.260
AUDIENCE: Because you have
the one injection trajectory,

00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:38.710
and then you have the primary
sites of the primary elipse,

00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:40.480
then the secondary.

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:45.010
And it's non-monotonic,
mostly [INAUDIBLE]..

00:54:45.010 --> 00:54:46.720
It doesn't go up, it goes down.

00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:47.790
So you have ideal.

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:49.900
Then you are out of it.

00:54:49.900 --> 00:54:51.530
Then you would land on rocks.

00:54:51.530 --> 00:54:54.160
And then you have the next
plateau, and maybe a third one,

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.104
on one pass by.

00:54:56.104 --> 00:54:57.520
PROFESSOR: That's
an interesting--

00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.450
that's an interesting comment.

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:03.550
I'm trying to figure out
what's the attribute-- what's

00:55:03.550 --> 00:55:05.890
the engineering attribute
that goes with that?

00:55:09.526 --> 00:55:12.550
AUDIENCE: Well, it's the
tolerance on the injection.

00:55:12.550 --> 00:55:14.550
I know that, at JPL--

00:55:14.550 --> 00:55:17.830
by the way, thanks for
organizing the [INAUDIBLE]----

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:19.440
they made this
presentation, also,

00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.850
of the landing of the rovers.

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:23.680
And they have the
primary ellipse

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.180
where they try to land--

00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:29.860
well, try-- it
depends on the entry.

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.800
And then they have secondary--
if they miss the entry,

00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:36.042
then they have very bad option.

00:55:36.042 --> 00:55:37.500
And then, maybe a
little bit later,

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.370
they maybe can land
on the next plateau,

00:55:39.370 --> 00:55:41.700
or in the next crater,
which is useful.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:46.602
So they have this non-monotonic,
but degrading, function.

00:55:46.602 --> 00:55:47.560
The first time is best.

00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:48.808
The second would still work.

00:55:48.808 --> 00:55:51.480
But in between, there's
a part that doesn't go.

00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.760
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.040
Got to think about that one.

00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.590
But that's an
interesting-- that's

00:55:56.590 --> 00:55:58.950
a pretty interesting example.

00:55:58.950 --> 00:56:03.790
So, the main point here is that
in order to calculate utility,

00:56:03.790 --> 00:56:08.440
you need a translation function
between the engineering

00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:13.750
or financial attributes of
each alternative and utility.

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:16.750
If it's not-- if it
was directly that,

00:56:16.750 --> 00:56:18.130
you'd just have a linear, right?

00:56:18.130 --> 00:56:20.470
It would be a 45
degree line, right?

00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:22.750
Or negative 45.

00:56:22.750 --> 00:56:27.040
But typically the mapping
from your attribute values

00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:29.320
to the utility is non-linear.

00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:30.460
And that's what this says.

00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:37.240
So then the challenge
is well, how do you

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.770
get these utility functions?

00:56:38.770 --> 00:56:40.400
Where do they come from?

00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.890
And the answer is you've
got to do interviews,

00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:44.200
you have to survey people--

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.240
the decision-makers, the
stakeholders we talked about.

00:56:47.240 --> 00:56:49.420
They're the ones who
have these utility

00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:52.520
functions in their minds,
even if they're not--

00:56:52.520 --> 00:56:55.060
So you've got to
make those explicit.

00:56:55.060 --> 00:56:56.600
So here's an example.

00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.990
You may have three different
customers for your system.

00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:01.960
User attribute, some
performance attribute.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:06.610
Customer one is shown here.

00:57:06.610 --> 00:57:08.890
They need a minimum
amount of performance,

00:57:08.890 --> 00:57:11.590
but once you reach this
threshold, after that there's

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:13.320
no more utility.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.270
But then customer two and
customer three are different.

00:57:16.270 --> 00:57:19.750
They want-- their utility
increases gradually,

00:57:19.750 --> 00:57:23.590
and in fact, customer three
doesn't see any much utility

00:57:23.590 --> 00:57:25.940
until you hit this
much higher level.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:28.930
So one of the challenges, then,
in designing these utility

00:57:28.930 --> 00:57:33.160
functions when you have multiple
customers is to solicit this--

00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:37.180
and there's interview and survey
techniques for doing that--

00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:39.380
and then combining those.

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:41.500
And then the other
challenge in combining

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.590
them is that, remember
at the system level,

00:57:44.590 --> 00:57:47.980
utility is still between
zero and one, right?

00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:51.550
So if you had, for
example, two attributes,

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.220
and they both give
you perfect utility,

00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:59.400
and you add them together
you'd get a utility of what?

00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:01.850
You have two attributes.

00:58:01.850 --> 00:58:02.610
Two.

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:06.690
But that can't be because the
total system utility can never

00:58:06.690 --> 00:58:08.040
be better than one.

00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.330
So you have to normalize.

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:11.100
As you combine
the utilities, you

00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:15.450
have to normalize them, and
actually weight them as well.

00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:19.800
So here's the equation when
you have two utilities.

00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:24.030
You basically have the utility
of the system just from J1--

00:58:24.030 --> 00:58:28.470
your first attribute--
times the utility of J2.

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:31.710
This is the mixed term,
right, the combined term.

00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:37.800
Plus the utility of just J1
plus the utility of just J2.

00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:41.910
Then you have this K factor
here-- this capital K factor--

00:58:41.910 --> 00:58:45.090
which re-normalizes
everything to zero and one.

00:58:45.090 --> 00:58:46.700
And if you have
more than two, then

00:58:46.700 --> 00:58:49.570
it becomes a matrix calculation.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:52.230
So it's a little tricky for
how to do this properly,

00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:54.270
but it's well-known
how to do this.

00:58:54.270 --> 00:58:58.020
So the steps in multi-attribute
utility analysis

00:58:58.020 --> 00:59:01.170
are to identify your
objectives and attributes,

00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:03.060
you develop an
interview questionnaire,

00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.040
you administer
that questionnaire.

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:08.040
You then develop your
aggregate utility functions,

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.440
you determine the utility
of your alternatives,

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:13.170
and then you
analyze the results.

00:59:13.170 --> 00:59:16.210
And there is one word of
caution I want to give you,

00:59:16.210 --> 00:59:18.120
which is that utility
is essentially

00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.000
the surrogate of value,
but value often we

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:24.120
express in dollars,
in monetary terms.

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:27.010
But utility is unit-less.

00:59:27.010 --> 00:59:31.980
So let me just comment
about utility maximization.

00:59:31.980 --> 00:59:34.025
It's very common and
generally well accepted.

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:40.440
It's a non-linear combination
of your criteria-- your decision

00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.580
criteria.

00:59:41.580 --> 00:59:44.370
The downside of it is
the physical meaning

00:59:44.370 --> 00:59:48.990
is often lost, because the
engineering or customer focused

00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:50.970
attributes all get combined.

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:54.960
So you say this system
has a utility 0.83,

00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:58.210
and this one has a utility 0.75.

00:59:58.210 --> 01:00:00.950
So one is better than the
other, but immediately you

01:00:00.950 --> 01:00:02.250
want to say well why is that?

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:03.270
What does that mean?

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:06.360
So then you have to backtrack
and reverse engineer

01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:10.110
how those utilities
were calculated.

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:12.510
You need to obtain a
mathematical representation

01:00:12.510 --> 01:00:14.850
for all utility functions, and--

01:00:14.850 --> 01:00:18.780
this is a probably not
just US-M centric comment,

01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:21.120
this is probably everywhere
in the world more or less--

01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:24.780
but the utility function can
vary drastically depending

01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.290
on the decision maker.

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:29.340
This is a big issue in
government programs.

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.770
So you guys, it's uniform
day, I guess, today.

01:00:32.770 --> 01:00:35.550
So how long is a
typical tour of duty

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:39.000
of a program manager in the
Pentagon for a big program?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.850
What would you say?

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:44.774
AUDIENCE: It's usually
three to four years.

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:47.190
PROFESSOR: So three to four
years, like it's written here.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:52.680
And what does that that mean
in practice for these utility

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:53.960
functions and for programs?

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:04.660
Sorry I'm putting
you on the spot here.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:08.320
AUDIENCE: Well,
you don't usually

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.780
have a lot of overlap
between the PM.

01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.880
So, as one goes
out, another one's

01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:17.050
coming in, so you're
losing a lot of experience,

01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:20.790
gaining somebody who doesn't
have much experience.

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:22.322
So there's a
learning curve here.

01:01:22.322 --> 01:01:23.030
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:01:27.759 --> 01:01:28.300
That's right.

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:30.980
What I'm getting at is--
so there's definitely that

01:01:30.980 --> 01:01:32.070
effect--

01:01:32.070 --> 01:01:34.580
but the priorities
may be different.

01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:38.620
You know, whereas the prior
program manager really valued

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:44.410
a lot performance
or quick response,

01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:47.590
and the next program manager--
because maybe the context has

01:01:47.590 --> 01:01:48.530
changed--

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:51.150
is very, very cost conscious.

01:01:51.150 --> 01:01:53.500
Really wants a system that
is very, very affordable,

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.160
and is willing to sacrifice
performance for that.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:01.870
So the way you can think of
this is the shape of the utility

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:05.820
curves for those decision
makers has now shifted,

01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:08.940
and because of that
the architecture

01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:11.620
or the choice of concept
that you would go for

01:02:11.620 --> 01:02:13.385
may be different.

01:02:13.385 --> 01:02:15.510
AUDIENCE: This happens to
NASA all the time, right?

01:02:15.510 --> 01:02:16.218
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:02:16.218 --> 01:02:18.430
And so this is not
just a DOD issue.

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:19.690
And in commercial world.

01:02:19.690 --> 01:02:24.280
You know, a new CEO comes
in, new CTO comes in,

01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.580
and these utility
curves actually shift.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:29.440
So you've got to be
to be aware of this.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:32.470
So one of the big
topics there is--

01:02:32.470 --> 01:02:35.230
particularly now with NASA is--

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:38.920
how do you choose an
architecture, a concept,

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:44.260
that is robust to changing
utilities and decision makers.

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.600
So maybe you don't go
for the super duper

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:49.540
best, most exciting,
most capable

01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:51.850
concept, but you go
for the one that's

01:02:51.850 --> 01:02:56.020
least likely to be
overturned or disrupted

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:58.820
with the next administration.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:01.940
And this is a discussion--
active discussion--

01:03:01.940 --> 01:03:03.650
right now at NASA headquarters.

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:05.450
You know, what are
the investments

01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:08.360
you can make that are
going to provide utility,

01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:12.110
even if the utility function
of the future decision makers

01:03:12.110 --> 01:03:13.440
changes?

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:16.110
It's a big, big topic.

01:03:16.110 --> 01:03:18.260
The other thing
is, of course, this

01:03:18.260 --> 01:03:20.820
requires your formulation
of preferences.

01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:23.720
Those K factors,
those weightings,

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:26.000
a priori-- before
you've actually

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.410
scored the alternatives.

01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:28.910
All right.

01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:31.010
So the example I want
to talk you through

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:34.700
is essentially a space tug.

01:03:34.700 --> 01:03:37.520
So we're going to do
trade space exploration.

01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:40.760
There's a trade space, a
design space, of alternatives--

01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:42.620
conceptual alternatives.

01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:44.600
And we're going to
try to understand

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.220
that using utility theory.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.780
And let me explain to you
what we mean by space tug.

01:03:50.780 --> 01:03:54.230
So a space tug is essentially a
satellite that has the ability

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:58.400
to change its orbital elements--
there are six orbital elements,

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.640
semi-major axis,
eccentricity, inclination,

01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:05.830
right ascension of the
ascending node, and so forth--

01:04:05.830 --> 01:04:08.720
of a target satellite
by a predefined amount

01:04:08.720 --> 01:04:12.330
without degrading its
functionality in the process.

01:04:12.330 --> 01:04:14.330
So here's a picture
of the earth.

01:04:14.330 --> 01:04:15.800
There's two orbits.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.190
The space tug is here
in the black orbit,

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:22.530
and then our target satellite
is in the orange orbit.

01:04:22.530 --> 01:04:26.000
And so the typical
process is the space tug

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.850
waits in its parking
orbit-- the black orbit.

01:04:28.850 --> 01:04:30.170
It gets tasked.

01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:33.620
It transfers to the other
orbit, searches for the target,

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:37.520
identifies it rendezvous and
approach, docking and capture,

01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:41.090
does an orbital transfer
and then releases the target

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:44.510
satellite at the new
orbit, verifies its status

01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:46.670
and then either goes
directly to the next target,

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:49.040
or returns to the parking orbit.

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.630
And as you can
imagine, depending

01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:52.610
on the plane changes
that are required here

01:04:52.610 --> 01:04:54.920
this can be quite expensive.

01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:57.920
It's less expensive in
geosynchronous orbit,

01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:02.900
and there are some
capabilities that we

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.420
think heard about in
the public that US

01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:08.000
and maybe other countries
have as well to do this.

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:14.180
But there's also applications--
commercial applications for it.

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:16.310
So, for example,
for space debris

01:05:16.310 --> 01:05:18.240
removal and things like that.

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.060
So that's what we
mean by space tug.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.220
So what are the attributes?

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:28.020
What are the-- so this is
based on a paper from 2003

01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.800
called Understanding the Orbital
Transfer Vehicle Trade Space.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:37.530
And so here's three attributes
that are combined into utility:

01:05:37.530 --> 01:05:41.610
total delta V capability-- delta
V is the change in velocity.

01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:44.640
This essentially tells
you where can it go?

01:05:44.640 --> 01:05:47.100
You calculate that from
essentially the rocket

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:48.240
equation.

01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:50.430
The second one is response time.

01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:53.850
How fast can it get there
after it has been tasked?

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:55.850
And there there's a big
distinction between--

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:58.360
it's almost binary--
between electric propulsion,

01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.190
which is very efficient
but slow, and then chemical

01:06:02.190 --> 01:06:03.360
propulsion.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:07.350
The third is the mass of
the observation or grappling

01:06:07.350 --> 01:06:08.520
equipment.

01:06:08.520 --> 01:06:12.010
And so this tells you what
it can do when it gets there.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:14.820
So the size of target
satellites that can be actually

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:16.140
interacted with.

01:06:16.140 --> 01:06:20.280
Those are the three attributes
that define utility,

01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:25.110
and we combine those into a
utility between zero and one.

01:06:25.110 --> 01:06:28.380
And then in this case, cost
or a surrogate for cost

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.060
is kept separately.

01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.250
This is the vehicle
wet and dry mass.

01:06:32.250 --> 01:06:33.840
These are the cost
drivers, and this

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:37.950
is calculated from some
simple scaling relationships.

01:06:37.950 --> 01:06:39.720
And so what we're
interested in is

01:06:39.720 --> 01:06:42.390
looking at the trade
space of utility

01:06:42.390 --> 01:06:45.990
versus cost of the system.

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:50.720
So how is utility
defined for a space tug?

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:58.060
So we have response time, which
is bad in electric systems.

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:02.104
Total utility is a weighted sum,
and then we estimate the cost

01:07:02.104 --> 01:07:03.020
from wet and dry mass.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:06.030
So the delta V
utility is shown here.

01:07:06.030 --> 01:07:07.890
This is in terms of
meters per second.

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:11.670
So two, four, six, eight,
10 kilometers per second.

01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:15.110
These are pretty large delta
Vs. And what's interesting

01:07:15.110 --> 01:07:20.210
is this is a larger is
better, but it's a step curve.

01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:22.700
It's not a smooth curve,
it's a step curve.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.810
Why is that?

01:07:23.810 --> 01:07:27.200
Because as you reach
certain delta Vs,

01:07:27.200 --> 01:07:32.480
it enables operating just in
GEO or a LEO-GEO transfer,

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.710
or a LEO-GEO return.

01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:35.210
Right?

01:07:35.210 --> 01:07:38.230
So you can use the space
tug more than once,

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:39.560
the more delta V you have.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.850
And it's a step curve because as
you hit this value of delta V,

01:07:43.850 --> 01:07:48.360
you can now operate
in a different regime.

01:07:48.360 --> 01:07:49.890
The capability.

01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:53.460
The payload mass
utility is essentially

01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:57.690
discretized between low,
medium, high, and extreme.

01:07:57.690 --> 01:07:59.490
So low is for small satellites.

01:07:59.490 --> 01:08:02.220
Medium satellites up
to one metric ton,

01:08:02.220 --> 01:08:04.500
up to three metric tons,
and then more than five

01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.500
metric tons, which
are the big satellites

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.390
in geosynchronous orbit.

01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:13.410
And then the weighting factors
are we're going to capability

01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:17.670
30%, delta V 60%, and
the time responsiveness

01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:20.130
of the system 10%.

01:08:20.130 --> 01:08:23.100
So time responsiveness is
not that important compared

01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.939
to the other two.

01:08:24.939 --> 01:08:26.609
So once we have this--

01:08:26.609 --> 01:08:28.680
I'm not going to go
through all the details

01:08:28.680 --> 01:08:30.689
of the calculations.

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:33.920
That's in that paper,
which I'll post.

01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:35.920
You get this.

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:37.870
So this is a cloud of points.

01:08:37.870 --> 01:08:40.890
Each point here represents
a particular alternative

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:45.090
or architecture, and we have the
cost of the system in millions

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:45.649
of dollars.

01:08:45.649 --> 01:08:46.980
So this is not cheap.

01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:47.479
All right?

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:50.590
This is a billion dollars,
two billion, three billion.

01:08:50.590 --> 01:08:54.359
And then we have this utility,
this dimensionless utility.

01:08:54.359 --> 01:08:56.640
And, of course, what we're
particularly interested in

01:08:56.640 --> 01:09:01.170
is this lower right corner:
high utility lower cost systems.

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:06.990
And what we did here is to
identify some particularly

01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:08.670
interesting
architecture, as they're

01:09:08.670 --> 01:09:10.470
shown here in this space.

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:13.290
So let me just
explain two of them.

01:09:13.290 --> 01:09:14.569
One of them, here--

01:09:14.569 --> 01:09:17.609
and we gave them names
that are recognizable.

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:21.060
So this point here,
it's below 0.4,

01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.840
so it's a rather
lower utility system,

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.260
but it's also
relatively affordable.

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.920
We call it the bi-prop
low-earth orbit tender.

01:09:31.920 --> 01:09:34.859
So it's intended for
use in low-earth orbit

01:09:34.859 --> 01:09:38.609
and it has a dry mass
of about 680 kilograms,

01:09:38.609 --> 01:09:40.410
a wet mass of 1,400.

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.240
So the difference
is propellant--

01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:44.939
about 800 kilograms
of propellant--

01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:47.800
and has reasonable
size and mass fraction.

01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.370
And it's fairly responsive.

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:55.200
Another alternative is what we
call the electric geocruiser.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.860
Sounds cool, doesn't it?

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.670
This is basically a space
tug that operates only

01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:01.680
in geosynchronous orbit.

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:04.200
So you launch into
geosynchronous orbit,

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:07.800
but once it's there
it can do a lot.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.410
But it's electric,
so it's kind of slow.

01:10:10.410 --> 01:10:12.670
Seven hundred eleven
kilograms dry mass,

01:10:12.670 --> 01:10:15.530
1,100 kilograms wet mass.

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:20.460
And it includes return of
the tug to a safe orbit.

01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:25.410
And this is sort of a versatile
space tug in the GEO belt.

01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:28.050
So that's the idea.

01:10:28.050 --> 01:10:32.140
You calculate utility,
shown on the x-axis,

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.750
you have the cost of the system.

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:35.100
You have this cloud of points.

01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.930
And you start
understanding what are

01:10:36.930 --> 01:10:41.760
the interesting architectures
in that trade space.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.480
This is the same trade space.

01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:45.510
But now what we've
done here is we've

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:49.990
shown the choice of
propulsion system is critical.

01:10:49.990 --> 01:10:53.620
And what you can see here,
it's really almost impossible

01:10:53.620 --> 01:10:55.420
to get to a utility of one.

01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.730
It's very, very hard.

01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:02.550
And the reason for this
is the rocket equation.

01:11:02.550 --> 01:11:03.540
You see how these--

01:11:03.540 --> 01:11:08.280
so the blue are the
bi-propellant architectures.

01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.710
The purple are the
cryogenic, so these are

01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:13.260
[? lux ?] hydrogen propulsion.

01:11:13.260 --> 01:11:15.540
The yellow ones are the
electric propulsion system,

01:11:15.540 --> 01:11:17.610
and then we also have
nuclear propulsion, here,

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:21.450
which clearly is challenging
and has policy implications.

01:11:21.450 --> 01:11:23.550
So you can see the
nuclear propulsion gets

01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:26.100
you close to much
higher utility,

01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:28.170
but it's also much,
much more expensive.

01:11:28.170 --> 01:11:30.300
But in all cases,
as you're trying

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.460
to get more and more
utility, at some point

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:35.470
you hit the wall because
of the rocket equation,

01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:37.040
which is very non-linear.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.730
You know, more fuel--

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:40.410
in order to carry
more fuel, you need

01:11:40.410 --> 01:11:42.840
more dry mass, more
fuel and dry mass

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:47.640
requires more fuel to push,
and the system blows up on you.

01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:49.750
And you can see this
in these curves.

01:11:49.750 --> 01:11:52.110
So you get some
physical intuition

01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:53.700
in terms of the
shape of the space.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:54.340
Yeah?

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:57.574
AUDIENCE: Is there a reason
between this layering of cost?

01:11:57.574 --> 01:11:58.240
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:02.790
They're essentially, if
I remember correctly,

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:05.680
the capability of the system.

01:12:05.680 --> 01:12:08.160
Remember there's this
small, medium, large,

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:11.010
you know the size of
the grappling equipment?

01:12:11.010 --> 01:12:12.690
I think that's the
tiering that you see.

01:12:12.690 --> 01:12:16.294
AUDIENCE: That doesn't
change the utility?

01:12:16.294 --> 01:12:18.460
PROFESSOR: Well, it depends
on the weighting, right?

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:21.310
So as you change the weighting
among the attributes,

01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:22.810
that space can get scrambled.

01:12:22.810 --> 01:12:28.270
This space is valid for
that particular weighting.

01:12:28.270 --> 01:12:30.250
So any questions about--

01:12:30.250 --> 01:12:34.210
this is utility theory,
multi-attribute utility theory,

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:38.280
applied to trade
space exploration.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.480
Any questions?

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:40.980
Go ahead.

01:12:44.530 --> 01:12:45.775
EPFL, do you have a question?

01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:53.050
OK.

01:12:53.050 --> 01:12:57.160
So now what you see
here is implicitly,

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.950
is there's nothing here
in the lower right corner.

01:12:59.950 --> 01:13:03.700
There is no system that
has perfect utility

01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:05.140
and is low cost.

01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:06.000
Right?

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.000
There's an empty space.

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.880
We'd love to be here, but
there's nothing there.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.615
So the best we can do
is get close to that.

01:13:12.615 --> 01:13:14.740
And that's what I want to
talk about next, which is

01:13:14.740 --> 01:13:16.930
this concept of non-dominance.

01:13:16.930 --> 01:13:18.580
So what do we mean
by non-dominance?

01:13:18.580 --> 01:13:21.760
What is a Pareto
frontier and what is

01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.890
multi-objective optimization?

01:13:23.890 --> 01:13:27.220
The key point about
this is that when

01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:30.520
you do non-dominance
filtering, when

01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.800
you look for Pareto
frontiers, you

01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:36.880
do not need to express your
preferences ahead of time.

01:13:36.880 --> 01:13:37.610
Right?

01:13:37.610 --> 01:13:41.600
So when you do you a
weighted Pugh matrix or when

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:46.190
you do a utility theory, you
had to define ahead of time,

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:49.640
before you did the scoring,
what's more important--

01:13:49.640 --> 01:13:53.540
fuel efficiency is twice
as important to me as cost.

01:13:53.540 --> 01:13:54.040
Right?

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.760
The weighting, the
preferences had

01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:00.080
to be expressed a priori--
before you did the scoring.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.890
And there's arguments that
that's not the best thing

01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:06.950
to do, but you can do it.

01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:12.500
Here in non-dominance and
multi-objective optimization,

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:15.200
eventually you have to
express your preferences,

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.530
but you do it after
you've scored the options.

01:14:18.530 --> 01:14:21.350
That's a really
important distinction.

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:25.000
So let me give you a little
history here on this.

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.460
And what's really interesting is
there's a Lausanne connection.

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:29.182
OK?

01:14:29.182 --> 01:14:30.640
There's a connection
with Lausanne.

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.780
So the word Pareto
frontier is named

01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:38.890
after a an economist,
who actually

01:14:38.890 --> 01:14:42.040
started as an engineer,
Vilfredo Pareto.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.230
He was born in Paris in
1848 and then graduated

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:50.770
from the University
of Turin in 1870.

01:14:50.770 --> 01:14:54.220
Very much in engineering,
civil engineering,

01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:56.950
his thesis title was The
Fundamental Principles

01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:59.200
of Equilibrium and Solid Bodies.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.780
Something we take--
that's pretty basic now.

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:06.370
Forces and torques in
equilibrium on a body.

01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:11.080
Now he worked as a civil
engineer in Florence,

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.290
and then he got interested
in philosophy, politics,

01:15:14.290 --> 01:15:17.590
and economics, and he started
to think about this in terms

01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:22.850
of how does this concept of
equilibrium apply to economics?

01:15:22.850 --> 01:15:25.840
And in 1893, he actually
became a professor

01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:27.490
at the University
of Lausanne, which

01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:31.300
is located right next
to EPFL, and started

01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:37.870
applying this to economics
and societal theory.

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:43.210
And then he did-- some of his
work was a bit controversial,

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:45.610
but the one that I
want to talk about here

01:15:45.610 --> 01:15:48.070
is this the idea of
the Pareto optimum.

01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:51.460
And I will-- let me just
read this quote to you.

01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.880
"The optimum allocation of
the resources of a society

01:15:54.880 --> 01:15:57.460
is not attained,
so long as it is

01:15:57.460 --> 01:16:00.850
possible to make at least
one individual better off

01:16:00.850 --> 01:16:05.320
in his or her own estimation,
while keeping others

01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:09.620
as well off as before in
their own estimation."

01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:13.810
So what it means is if
you can make an investment

01:16:13.810 --> 01:16:19.780
or make a change in society that
makes a particular individual

01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:24.160
or group of individuals better
off in their own estimation,

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.630
without having to take the
resources from another group

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:31.860
and make them less
well-off, then you've

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:35.129
not reached an optimal
allocation of resources.

01:16:35.129 --> 01:16:36.670
You know, if there
can be a win-win--

01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:40.080
if everybody can be better off
by making certain investments,

01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:43.560
you haven't yet found
the optimal strategy.

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.610
Only when-- the only way
to make somebody better off

01:16:47.610 --> 01:16:50.670
in their own estimation than
somebody else is by taking--

01:16:50.670 --> 01:16:53.730
and this is a big political
debate still today--

01:16:53.730 --> 01:16:57.030
by taking from one group
and redistributing resources

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:58.230
to the other.

01:16:58.230 --> 01:17:00.400
When you're in that
situation, then you

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:03.580
are at the Pareto optimal point.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:04.470
OK?

01:17:04.470 --> 01:17:08.610
So that's the key
idea underlying this.

01:17:08.610 --> 01:17:16.140
So what this means
mathematically is that

01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:17.610
an optimal solution --

01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:21.540
X*-- is optimal if and only if--

01:17:24.130 --> 01:17:27.100
for a feasible solution--
so, first of all the solution

01:17:27.100 --> 01:17:28.970
has to be feasible.

01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:32.770
And this is when you
have multiple criteria.

01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:34.900
We're trying to do
vector optimization,

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:37.660
and x must be what we call
an efficient solution,

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:40.630
and it's efficient only
if its objective vector--

01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:44.020
J of X-- is non- dominated.

01:17:44.020 --> 01:17:48.430
And what this means is that
if you're looking at a point,

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:51.760
it's only efficient
when it is not

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:55.390
possible to move from that
point to another point

01:17:55.390 --> 01:18:00.740
without degrading at least
one of the other objectives.

01:18:00.740 --> 01:18:03.580
So if you can move from
a particular design point

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:08.030
to another design point, and
all the objectives get better,

01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:09.760
you're not yet efficient.

01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.460
You're not yet at a
Pareto optimal point.

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:16.950
And this gets us to the
notion of dominance.

01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:21.970
So dominance-- let's say we have
two designs, two alternatives--

01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:23.950
J1 and J2.

01:18:23.950 --> 01:18:26.110
Those are their
objective vectors.

01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:28.750
It means that-- this
is for maximization.

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:30.640
We're trying to maximize.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.380
It means J1 dominates
J2 weakly if J1

01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:43.710
is better or equal J2, and at
least in one of the objectives,

01:18:43.710 --> 01:18:47.840
I, strictly better than J2.

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.530
So you could have
two alternatives.

01:18:49.530 --> 01:18:51.830
This gets back to Pugh
matrix and the question--

01:18:51.830 --> 01:18:55.090
who asked about the ties?

01:18:55.090 --> 01:18:57.462
You did, right?

01:18:57.462 --> 01:18:58.800
It's so long ago.

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.770
It's like, wait a minute, it's
like an hour ago, you know?

01:19:01.770 --> 01:19:05.430
So we have two alternatives, OK?

01:19:05.430 --> 01:19:07.300
They're all equal.

01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.900
They're tied in all
criteria, except for one,

01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:12.690
where J1 is better than J2.

01:19:12.690 --> 01:19:16.740
Which means that J1 will
dominate J2, but weakly,

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:17.970
because there's some ties.

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:18.960
Right?

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.610
And then there's a
stronger definition,

01:19:20.610 --> 01:19:26.520
which is that J1 strongly
dominates dominates J2 if

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:29.340
and only if it is
better strictly

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:32.290
better in all attributes.

01:19:32.290 --> 01:19:35.580
So for J1 to
dominate J2 strongly,

01:19:35.580 --> 01:19:39.860
it's got to be better in
all attributes than J2.

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:42.460
Does that make sense?

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:42.960
OK.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.020
So I know this is
a bit abstract.

01:19:46.020 --> 01:19:48.390
So let's do a concept
question that's

01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:52.590
sort of based on a
hypothetical but real example.

01:19:52.590 --> 01:19:57.110
So assume-- let's
say you're in charge

01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:00.470
of designing in new
commercial aircraft,

01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:03.700
and there's four criteria.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:06.040
You want to maximize range.

01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.870
You want to minimize the costs--

01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:10.450
dollars per kilometer flown.

01:20:10.450 --> 01:20:13.390
You want to maximize the
capacity of the airplane--

01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:14.950
number of passengers.

01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:19.240
And you want to maximize cruise
speed in kilometers per hour.

01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:22.730
So it's a multi-objective
aircraft design.

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:23.920
You do all the work.

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:25.480
You do concept generation.

01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:28.120
You come up with eight
concepts for airplanes,

01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.800
and you evaluate them.

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:32.620
And they're shown here--
one, two, three, et cetera,

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:33.880
through eight.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.380
So let's just look
at number one.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:36.850
What does this mean?

01:20:36.850 --> 01:20:39.370
Airplane number one,
concept number one,

01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:43.570
has a range of 7,587 kilometers.

01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:47.660
It has a operating cost
of $321 per kilometer.

01:20:47.660 --> 01:20:50.440
It can carry 112 passengers.

01:20:50.440 --> 01:20:52.810
And it has a cruise
speed or max speed

01:20:52.810 --> 01:20:55.910
of 950 kilometers per hour.

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:57.880
So I'm going to leave this up.

01:20:57.880 --> 01:21:01.120
This is like a five
minute-- this is--

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:04.122
on the next slide,
I'm going to ask you--

01:21:04.122 --> 01:21:06.130
and we'll come back to this--

01:21:06.130 --> 01:21:10.830
which of these airplane designs,
these eight, are non-dominated.

01:21:10.830 --> 01:21:14.970
Meaning that they're not
dominated by any of the other.

01:21:14.970 --> 01:21:17.770
And we're going to apply
weak dominance here.

01:21:17.770 --> 01:21:19.520
That was going to be
your question, right?

01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:20.510
Weak dominance.

01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:22.187
So I don't think it
actually matters.

01:21:22.187 --> 01:21:24.020
I don't think there's
too many ties in here,

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:27.260
but apply weak dominance.

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:30.200
So which of these
are non-dominated?

01:21:30.200 --> 01:21:35.550
Meaning that you wouldn't
discard them right off the bat,

01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:39.330
because there are some strong
features that they have.

01:21:39.330 --> 01:21:43.530
So work through this.

01:21:43.530 --> 01:21:49.350
You might want to write down
which ones are non-dominated.

01:21:49.350 --> 01:21:51.510
And then we'll do
the concert question,

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:53.640
and then we'll show
you the answer.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.110
AUDIENCE: I just
want to make sure.

01:21:55.110 --> 01:21:58.440
So non-dominated as
in there is not one

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.614
that could be considered
better than it?

01:22:01.614 --> 01:22:02.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:07.160
So, this is the definition.

01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:10.480
All right.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:16.060
So let me-- so please
submit your answers.

01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:18.220
So here are the choices.

01:22:18.220 --> 01:22:20.440
Which airplane designs
are non-dominated?

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.450
Five, six, and seven.

01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:24.400
One, three, four, and eight.

01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.930
One, two, three,
four, and eight.

01:22:25.930 --> 01:22:27.090
Two, three, five, and six.

01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:28.300
One, three, four, and seven.

01:22:28.300 --> 01:22:32.140
Or you need-- this
is not answerable.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:35.270
You need more information
to answer the question.

01:22:35.270 --> 01:22:37.470
OK?

01:22:37.470 --> 01:22:44.800
So we have a pretty
good distribution here.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:49.710
So the wisdom of crowds
I think prevails.

01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:53.070
So the correct answer is the
third one-- one, two, three,

01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:54.480
four, and eight.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:58.530
So 36% of you got it right.

01:22:58.530 --> 01:23:02.010
Now let me let me show
you the solution to this.

01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:04.350
So it is, in fact,
possible to answer this

01:23:04.350 --> 01:23:07.090
without additional information.

01:23:07.090 --> 01:23:09.750
So the way to do
this is you have

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:12.430
to do pairwise comparisons.

01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:14.270
Now you said about--

01:23:14.270 --> 01:23:15.760
I think your strategy--

01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.380
What did you say, early on?

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.020
AUDIENCE: I was
looking at maximums.

01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:20.686
PROFESSOR: You were
looking at maximums.

01:23:20.686 --> 01:23:22.710
So you were saying
who's the best

01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:26.670
performer among the
concepts for each criteria?

01:23:26.670 --> 01:23:30.790
And you found those pretty
easily, I would assume, right?

01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:31.290
So what--

01:23:31.290 --> 01:23:33.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:34.230
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:23:34.230 --> 01:23:35.820
So you've got to
get the sign right.

01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:38.230
Do you have the
mic on, by the way.

01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:41.190
So what would--
if that concept is

01:23:41.190 --> 01:23:43.260
the best performer
in a criterion,

01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:45.100
what does that tell you?

01:23:45.100 --> 01:23:47.520
AUDIENCE: It means that
none of the other performers

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.320
have something
equal to or greater

01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:53.370
than that performer
for that criterion.

01:23:53.370 --> 01:23:57.020
PROFESSOR: And this relates to
the question-- is it Martin?

01:23:57.020 --> 01:23:57.690
Martin?

01:23:57.690 --> 01:23:59.150
In the red shirt, first row?

01:24:01.882 --> 01:24:03.090
I didn't get your name right.

01:24:03.090 --> 01:24:04.692
I'm sorry.

01:24:04.692 --> 01:24:05.442
AUDIENCE: Bastian.

01:24:05.442 --> 01:24:06.470
PROFESSOR: Bastian.

01:24:06.470 --> 01:24:07.410
Bastian.

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:08.610
Bastian.

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:10.410
You remember at the
start of the lecture,

01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:12.743
you said-- what did you say
at the start of the lecture?

01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:20.474
AUDIENCE: I said that if you
evaluate all the concepts based

01:24:20.474 --> 01:24:22.505
on just plus or minus
for the criteria,

01:24:22.505 --> 01:24:28.370
you might have one where
you evaluate all the--

01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:30.577
a bunch of criteria
that are negatives,

01:24:30.577 --> 01:24:32.160
but there's just one
that is positive.

01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.392
But that one might be
very, very positive.

01:24:34.392 --> 01:24:35.100
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:37.230
So that's exactly
the point here.

01:24:37.230 --> 01:24:38.910
That's exactly this point.

01:24:38.910 --> 01:24:42.750
If you are-- if this concept
is the best performer

01:24:42.750 --> 01:24:44.870
in just one of the criteria.

01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:48.120
Like it has the best
speed, or the lowest cost,

01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:51.990
but it's terrible, terrible
in everything else,

01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.890
it doesn't matter.

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:56.610
In terms of dominance,
it is non-dominated.

01:24:56.610 --> 01:24:59.920
It cannot be dominated
by any other concept.

01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:03.570
If you are the best in class,
even just for one criteria--

01:25:03.570 --> 01:25:05.460
does that make sense?

01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:11.000
You cannot be dominated by any
other design if you're the best

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.879
performer on just one criterion.

01:25:14.879 --> 01:25:16.420
So let's think about
track and field.

01:25:19.090 --> 01:25:21.790
So the people-- who's
doing track and field?

01:25:21.790 --> 01:25:23.020
Any athletes here?

01:25:23.020 --> 01:25:25.780
Like runners or javelin or--

01:25:25.780 --> 01:25:26.300
Veronica.

01:25:26.300 --> 01:25:29.320
I didn't know that about you.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.510
Cross country and track.

01:25:30.510 --> 01:25:31.320
OK.

01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:32.270
So 5K?

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:35.870
All right.

01:25:35.870 --> 01:25:37.810
So let's say--

01:25:37.810 --> 01:25:40.820
I'm sure you were
very good at 5K.

01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:42.752
And how was your shot putt?

01:25:42.752 --> 01:25:45.690
AUDIENCE: I never
competed in the shot putt.

01:25:45.690 --> 01:25:46.630
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:49.240
So then we don't know, right?

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:53.110
But the point I'm trying to make
is you could be a super duper

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:56.840
specialist in one criterion,
and that's-- you can will win

01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:59.010
a gold medal with that.

01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:02.320
But you're very maybe
not good in other things.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.170
So that's the point
here is in order

01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:07.650
to be dominated, if you're
the best performer--

01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:10.770
so, right off the
bat, in this exercise

01:26:10.770 --> 01:26:12.930
here, in our little
exercise, you

01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:17.310
can remove all the concepts that
are best in class from the set.

01:26:17.310 --> 01:26:19.870
Because they cannot
be dominated.

01:26:19.870 --> 01:26:22.320
So they have to
be non-dominated.

01:26:22.320 --> 01:26:25.080
OK, so the way
you do the scoring

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:29.250
with pairwise comparisons is you
say, let's compare one and two.

01:26:29.250 --> 01:26:31.200
Concept one and two.

01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:36.060
Well, one is better
in range, right?

01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:38.640
And it's better in speed.

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:42.240
But then the second concept
is better in two and three.

01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:45.330
So the score here
is two versus two,

01:26:45.330 --> 01:26:50.220
which means neither one nor
two dominate each other, right?

01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:53.340
Even if it's-- what
if it's three to one?

01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:57.000
What if it was a
three to one score?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.740
It would still be true, right?

01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:01.440
That one doesn't--
one is, in a sense,

01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.600
better because it's
better than the other.

01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:06.840
But it doesn't dominate
it, because dominance

01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.110
is a very crisp definition.

01:27:10.110 --> 01:27:12.750
Now this is different, right?

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:14.670
Compare one versus number six.

01:27:14.670 --> 01:27:17.310
Concept one versus concept six.

01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:21.180
One is better in all
four criteria to six.

01:27:21.180 --> 01:27:25.020
So clearly, solution one
dominates solution six,

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:27.330
and as a rational
decision maker,

01:27:27.330 --> 01:27:30.840
you can eliminate
concept six from the set

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:34.550
because it is completely
dominated by concept one.

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:35.430
OK?

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:37.350
So in order to be
dominated, a solution

01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:42.970
must have essentially a score of
zero in a pairwise comparison.

01:27:42.970 --> 01:27:45.930
Now, if we apply this
to the full set of eight

01:27:45.930 --> 01:27:47.940
we can actually show
this as a matrix.

01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:50.760
I call that the
domination matrix.

01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.920
It shows which
solutions dominate

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:55.290
which other solution--
the horizontal rows

01:27:55.290 --> 01:27:56.910
and the vertical rows.

01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:00.240
So the way you read this is
so where you see these dots,

01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:01.980
these are dominance
relationships

01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:03.940
in the pairwise comparison.

01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:11.140
So this tells you that solution
two dominates solution five.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:13.630
This tells us, if
we look column-wise,

01:28:13.630 --> 01:28:17.350
solution seven is dominated
by solution two and solution

01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:18.550
eight.

01:28:18.550 --> 01:28:23.000
So, if we do the row sum-- if
we sum this along the rows,

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.840
the row indicates
how many solutions

01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:29.110
this particular
solution dominates.

01:28:29.110 --> 01:28:31.540
And-- but the question
was about non-dominance,

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:33.280
so we need to look
at the column sum.

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:35.800
The column sum
indicates by how many

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:40.390
other solutions the kth solution
or concept is dominated.

01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:42.760
And when you do
this column sum, you

01:28:42.760 --> 01:28:47.740
can see that concepts one, two,
three, and four have a zero.

01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:50.210
They're not dominated
by any other design.

01:28:50.210 --> 01:28:54.460
Column eight has a zero, and
concepts five, six, and seven

01:28:54.460 --> 01:28:58.360
are dominated each by at
least one other concept, which

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:03.340
means that they're
dominated, and the others

01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:05.480
are non dominated.

01:29:05.480 --> 01:29:07.990
So when you do your
concept selection,

01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:10.830
you can actually apply
this to a much bigger set.

01:29:10.830 --> 01:29:13.630
Your filter out all the
dominated solutions.

01:29:13.630 --> 01:29:17.560
And it turns out the bigger
your number of alternatives

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:21.340
or architectures, the smaller
percentage-wise the set

01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:23.920
will be of
non-dominated solutions.

01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:27.270
And those are the ones you
really want to focus on.

01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:29.190
Is that clear?

01:29:29.190 --> 01:29:32.520
I know this takes a
little thinking about,

01:29:32.520 --> 01:29:33.780
what does this really mean?

01:29:33.780 --> 01:29:38.300
But but that's a very
rigorous way to do it.

01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:41.010
And then this gets
us to, eventually,

01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:44.430
this gets us to the notion
of Pareto optimality.

01:29:44.430 --> 01:29:46.460
So what's the relationship
between Pareto

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:48.680
optimality and non-dominance.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:51.470
So let's say we have
two objectives, J1--

01:29:51.470 --> 01:29:53.150
we want to maximize J1.

01:29:53.150 --> 01:29:57.020
Maybe that's
performance, endurance.

01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.550
We want to minimize J2--

01:29:58.550 --> 01:30:00.410
maybe cost, for example.

01:30:00.410 --> 01:30:05.010
So the Utopian point, or
the optimal corner to be in,

01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:06.290
is the lower right.

01:30:06.290 --> 01:30:09.196
We want to maximize
J1, minimize J2.

01:30:09.196 --> 01:30:10.070
There's nothing here.

01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.740
It's empty.

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.440
There's nothing feasible here.

01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.290
So the best we can do
is get close to it.

01:30:15.290 --> 01:30:17.630
So when you look at a
set of discrete points,

01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:21.170
discrete concepts,
those concepts

01:30:21.170 --> 01:30:23.480
can have three properties.

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:26.660
They can be D,
meaning dominated.

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:31.340
So all the red points
shown here are dominated.

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.400
And the way you can see
this if you draw a little--

01:30:34.400 --> 01:30:40.130
let me try to let me
try to draw a box here.

01:30:44.970 --> 01:30:46.422
Where's the eraser?

01:30:54.180 --> 01:30:56.765
So let's pick a point,
a particular point--

01:30:59.800 --> 01:31:01.780
Let's pick this
point right here.

01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:07.000
Why do we know that
this point is dominated,

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.895
just looking at it graphically?

01:31:09.895 --> 01:31:10.770
How do you know that?

01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:14.710
Go ahead.

01:31:14.710 --> 01:31:16.755
AUDIENCE: The point
is not at the front.

01:31:16.755 --> 01:31:18.130
PROFESSOR: It's
not at the front,

01:31:18.130 --> 01:31:20.930
but the way the way
to find first of all,

01:31:20.930 --> 01:31:23.230
whether it's dominated,
which is relative

01:31:23.230 --> 01:31:26.950
to the other solutions, is we
can just draw a horizontal line

01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:29.720
here, and a vertical line here.

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:31.510
And so in a
multi-dimensional space,

01:31:31.510 --> 01:31:34.480
you're essentially
drawing a hyper-cube.

01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:37.570
And down here is our utopia.

01:31:37.570 --> 01:31:40.090
This is where we would love
to be, but we can't be.

01:31:40.090 --> 01:31:41.930
It's not feasible.

01:31:41.930 --> 01:31:45.880
And you see in this box, between
the point and the utopia,

01:31:45.880 --> 01:31:47.900
there is this other guy here.

01:31:47.900 --> 01:31:50.210
This point here.

01:31:50.210 --> 01:31:53.240
And because it's there,
it's closer to the utopia,

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:57.830
and it dominates this
point in both objectives.

01:31:57.830 --> 01:32:00.510
Let's take this point here.

01:32:00.510 --> 01:32:01.700
Let's do the same thing.

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:04.670
Draw a vertical line
and a horizontal line.

01:32:04.670 --> 01:32:06.560
And there's a whole
bunch of points,

01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:10.970
all these points right
here are all the box,

01:32:10.970 --> 01:32:12.680
closer to the Utopian point.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:15.470
So this point here is actually
dominated by one, two, three,

01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:19.610
four, five, six
seven other points.

01:32:19.610 --> 01:32:22.250
So that's essentially dominated.

01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:23.848
Let me erase this again.

01:32:27.520 --> 01:32:31.540
Then we have these darker
red, purple points.

01:32:31.540 --> 01:32:34.770
Let me just circle
them real quick.

01:32:34.770 --> 01:32:42.000
So we have this point here, this
point, this point, this point,

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.130
this one, and this one.

01:32:44.130 --> 01:32:46.980
And those are what we
call non-dominated,

01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:49.230
like we just did the filtering,
meaning there there's

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:53.730
no other point in the set that's
better than it in all criteria.

01:32:53.730 --> 01:32:57.510
So you would consider them
as concepts to choose from.

01:32:57.510 --> 01:33:03.160
But they're not exactly
on that dashed line,

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:05.670
which means that there
is a way to improve them.

01:33:05.670 --> 01:33:08.850
There's a way to tweak them,
to optimize them further,

01:33:08.850 --> 01:33:13.560
if you could to get them
right onto that dashed line.

01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:17.640
They're close but they're not
exactly on that dashed line.

01:33:17.640 --> 01:33:19.800
So you could tweak these
concepts to get them

01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:22.810
closer to the Pareto front.

01:33:22.810 --> 01:33:27.110
But they're still pretty good,
because they're non-dominated.

01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:31.370
And then we have those grey
points, which are shown here.

01:33:31.370 --> 01:33:33.320
There's three of them.

01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:36.062
Let me use a different
color for these.

01:33:42.230 --> 01:33:44.015
Let me use a different
color, maybe green.

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:49.740
Here.

01:33:49.740 --> 01:33:55.890
This point, this point, and this
point, they are Pareto optimal.

01:33:55.890 --> 01:33:58.660
Meaning they're on
the Pareto front.

01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:01.600
There's no way to
improve them, such

01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:04.310
that you could make
both objectives better.

01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.810
Right?

01:34:04.810 --> 01:34:09.130
If you want to make J1 better,
you have to sacrifice on J2.

01:34:09.130 --> 01:34:12.280
So the only way to
modify these points

01:34:12.280 --> 01:34:15.640
is to slide along
the Pareto front,

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:18.410
meaning you're trading
off the objectives.

01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:19.850
Do you see that?

01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:22.600
And so, in my spring
class that I teach,

01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:25.090
called Multi-disciplinary
System Optimization,

01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:26.560
we get into this pretty deeply.

01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:30.190
Like how do you
actually do this?

01:34:30.190 --> 01:34:33.600
But the point I want
you to keep for now

01:34:33.600 --> 01:34:37.800
is that when you
select the concept,

01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:40.810
do not select a dominated one.

01:34:40.810 --> 01:34:42.390
Get rid of the dominated ones.

01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:43.690
Filter them out.

01:34:43.690 --> 01:34:45.880
And then you still have to
choose among the others,

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:48.340
and that's where your
preferences come in.

01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:51.970
Right, so given the blue
and green choices here,

01:34:51.970 --> 01:34:54.520
which one are you going
to recommend at the end?

01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.440
And that this is sort of the
preferences between maximizing

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.590
J1 and minimizing J2.

01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:04.240
That's a social
process of coming up

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.680
with your preferences.

01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:08.860
But you now determine
those preferences

01:35:08.860 --> 01:35:11.515
after you've scored
all the concepts.

01:35:11.515 --> 01:35:13.420
Do you see the difference?

01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:16.720
That's pretty fundamental.

01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:17.580
OK.

01:35:17.580 --> 01:35:23.190
So, one more thing and
then we'll wrap it up.

01:35:23.190 --> 01:35:24.990
So now you've gone
through all this work.

01:35:24.990 --> 01:35:27.900
You've done your concept
generation, concept selections,

01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:32.330
scoring, and you
found the one concept

01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:35.760
that you're going
to go forward with.

01:35:35.760 --> 01:35:37.080
That's when you do PDR.

01:35:37.080 --> 01:35:38.250
So what is the PDR?

01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:39.570
The Preliminary Design Review.

01:35:39.570 --> 01:35:43.530
You explain what concept and
system architecture was chosen.

01:35:43.530 --> 01:35:48.030
You explain why it
was chosen, and you

01:35:48.030 --> 01:35:51.030
want this to be approved
as the design baseline

01:35:51.030 --> 01:35:54.540
for going forward and doing
more detailed design work.

01:35:54.540 --> 01:35:57.000
You compare it against
the rejected alternatives.

01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:00.720
Typically at the PDR, you will
spend some time on saying,

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:03.420
these are the other
interesting concepts

01:36:03.420 --> 01:36:05.760
that almost were
selected, but we didn't

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.220
because of these reasons.

01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:13.870
You show some quantitative
analysis that gives confidence,

01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:17.640
especially you want to show that
the requirements that you had

01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:20.280
defined and agreed
upon at the SRR

01:36:20.280 --> 01:36:23.890
can be satisfied by
your chosen concept.

01:36:23.890 --> 01:36:26.640
There's maybe still some
risk or some uncertainty.

01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:29.660
So any risk reduction
experiments or prototypes.

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.750
So you can actually do
prototyping at this stage.

01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:34.490
You don't want to
spend too much on that,

01:36:34.490 --> 01:36:38.030
but you want to do enough of
it so you can reduce risks.

01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:40.970
And then you do a preview
of the detailed design

01:36:40.970 --> 01:36:44.700
phase between PDR leading
up to CDR. So here--

01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:47.870
I'm not going to read this--
but this is the description

01:36:47.870 --> 01:36:50.480
of what the PDR is all about.

01:36:50.480 --> 01:36:54.160
In the NASA system engineering
handbook on page 177,

01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:55.970
there's a very
detailed description

01:36:55.970 --> 01:37:00.780
of entrance criteria, exit
criteria, et cetera, et cetera.

01:37:00.780 --> 01:37:05.982
So here's a description from
a PDR from a European program,

01:37:05.982 --> 01:37:07.940
and you can see it's a
pretty big group, right?

01:37:07.940 --> 01:37:10.340
This is like 30, 40 people.

01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:15.560
And because the PDR is
such an important decision,

01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:18.320
that's when you also invite
external stakeholders.

01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:21.560
And you want to make sure that
people come away from the PDR

01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:25.070
with confidence that,
yeah, we have a good system

01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.920
architecture.

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:28.650
We've picked the good
concept, and it's worthwhile

01:37:28.650 --> 01:37:30.900
now putting all this
work into getting it

01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:33.880
to a detailed design that
can actually be built.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:34.720
OK.

01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:39.590
Any questions about PDR, or
any experiences from PDRs

01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:41.510
that people want to share?

01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:44.004
AUDIENCE: I have a
question about the PDR.

01:37:44.004 --> 01:37:45.920
So you said there's 30
people in that picture.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:50.380
How do you reconcile that with
seven plus, minus two rule?

01:37:50.380 --> 01:37:53.960
PROFESSOR: Well, it's seven,
plus or minus two, squared,

01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:54.740
right?

01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:59.990
So you have a
hierarchy of people.

01:37:59.990 --> 01:38:03.044
Not everybody is a
decision maker here.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:03.710
AUDIENCE: I see.

01:38:03.710 --> 01:38:05.293
PROFESSOR: So you
probably have people

01:38:05.293 --> 01:38:07.670
who did some of
the thermal design,

01:38:07.670 --> 01:38:09.800
some people did
the cost modeling.

01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:13.310
So, it's a great
question actually.

01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:16.340
You want many, many
voices and people

01:38:16.340 --> 01:38:19.070
who contributed to make
sure the PDR presents

01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:21.650
all the information you have.

01:38:21.650 --> 01:38:24.620
You don't want to do a PDR
with just seven people.

01:38:24.620 --> 01:38:27.230
AUDIENCE: But I guess you could
say that in the presentation,

01:38:27.230 --> 01:38:30.590
I guess, only seven plus
or minus two, will people

01:38:30.590 --> 01:38:32.880
be driving at that
point in time.

01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:36.740
PROFESSOR: So there will
be a leadership, right?

01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:40.340
There is an
organizational issue.

01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:46.670
But the point here is
that it's a big review.

01:38:46.670 --> 01:38:47.600
It's a big milestone.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:49.691
Please, go ahead.

01:38:49.691 --> 01:38:53.030
AUDIENCE: The big issue here is
that all the people who are not

01:38:53.030 --> 01:38:55.650
decision makers, that
are in the picture, they

01:38:55.650 --> 01:38:57.980
will have to implement
the detailed design,

01:38:57.980 --> 01:39:01.250
so it's very important to
have them in the process.

01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:03.914
Otherwise, you have to go back
to your organization and do

01:39:03.914 --> 01:39:07.186
the PDR again to explain
the what's and the why's.

01:39:07.186 --> 01:39:10.024
This is why you try to have
these very large meetings.

01:39:10.024 --> 01:39:13.772
When you do a pre-PDR,
you do a dry-run,

01:39:13.772 --> 01:39:16.490
and you send stuff in
advance and make sure

01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:19.274
that you're really
all agreeing finally,

01:39:19.274 --> 01:39:25.453
if possible, you get the
discrepancies off the table.

01:39:25.453 --> 01:39:27.661
But then you all agree that
this is how to go forward

01:39:27.661 --> 01:39:32.580
and then the worker
bees can go and do it.

01:39:32.580 --> 01:39:35.450
PROFESSOR: Yes, that's another
reason for being inclusive.

01:39:35.450 --> 01:39:36.570
I agree with that.

01:39:36.570 --> 01:39:41.480
Any other-- who has gone through
a PDR in their prior work?

01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:42.610
Anybody want to share?

01:39:42.610 --> 01:39:44.670
Marissa.

01:39:44.670 --> 01:39:46.060
Tell us about how that went.

01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:46.750
I mean as much--

01:39:46.750 --> 01:39:49.090
I know you can't probably
we share everything but--

01:39:49.090 --> 01:39:51.850
AUDIENCE: For us, I mean, it
was a pretty big milestone.

01:39:51.850 --> 01:39:53.766
You work a lot
leading up to a PDR

01:39:53.766 --> 01:39:56.140
and then you finally have all
the really big stakeholders

01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:56.620
in the room.

01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:58.300
And a lot of them have been
involved during the design

01:39:58.300 --> 01:40:00.800
phase, but when you actually
have them all sitting there.

01:40:00.800 --> 01:40:03.270
And I think getting the
buy-in was also really--

01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:05.290
I think that's a
really big part of PDR.

01:40:05.290 --> 01:40:06.250
Like normally you're
feeling pretty

01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:08.375
confident in your designs,
but then actually making

01:40:08.375 --> 01:40:11.530
sure whoever the agency is
that you're working with,

01:40:11.530 --> 01:40:15.215
then your stakeholders are also
kind of all on the same page.

01:40:15.215 --> 01:40:16.090
It's pretty critical.

01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:18.670
PROFESSOR: Did you discover
problems or discrepancies

01:40:18.670 --> 01:40:19.570
during the PDR?

01:40:19.570 --> 01:40:20.195
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:40:20.195 --> 01:40:23.830
I definitely think-- just
generally we've had delta PDRs,

01:40:23.830 --> 01:40:25.900
if things weren't
completely thought through.

01:40:25.900 --> 01:40:27.820
Or you'd have a fair
number of action items

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:30.840
that come out of PDR
to go and address

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.770
before you really are allowed
to start moving towards CDR.

01:40:33.770 --> 01:40:34.670
PROFESSOR: Good.

01:40:34.670 --> 01:40:37.776
Any comments or experiences
with PDRs at EPFL?

01:40:45.079 --> 01:40:46.870
AUDIENCE: I did a PDR
at the European Space

01:40:46.870 --> 01:40:49.900
Agency during the
REXUS BEXUS program

01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:52.240
three years ago, and
as far as I remember

01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:56.740
it was very appreciated to bring
as many details as possible.

01:40:56.740 --> 01:41:00.520
And to be very close to
that critical design review

01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:03.710
stage in the PDR.

01:41:03.710 --> 01:41:06.590
PROFESSOR: That's interesting.

01:41:06.590 --> 01:41:09.290
So, that's good.

01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:11.850
I think there's a good to
have detail and so forth.

01:41:11.850 --> 01:41:13.400
But what's the downside?

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.620
Can you think of a
negative what would

01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:22.550
be what would be not so good
about almost being a CDR right

01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:23.420
there?

01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:25.730
Can you think about
a downside to it?

01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:31.650
AUDIENCE: Probably not
taking too much time

01:41:31.650 --> 01:41:34.680
in order to clarify the
concept and the requirement

01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:40.740
because you are in a rush
to finish the product.

01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:42.710
PROFESSOR: That's a good point.

01:41:42.710 --> 01:41:44.762
So it takes more time.

01:41:44.762 --> 01:41:46.220
But what I'm thinking
about is it's

01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:49.930
very difficult to then undo
the decision or backtrack.

01:41:49.930 --> 01:41:52.850
Let's say that at the
PDR that there's some--

01:41:52.850 --> 01:41:54.950
it could be that
you really forgot

01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:56.420
something very important.

01:41:56.420 --> 01:42:00.620
And that your concept
is actually flawed.

01:42:00.620 --> 01:42:04.160
But you didn't know it as you
were working inside your team.

01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:07.820
And then if you have a design
that's almost CDR quality,

01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:09.930
it's very difficult
to undo that.

01:42:09.930 --> 01:42:12.790
So I would say that a PDR--

01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:18.020
I actually believe that at a
PDR you should have some detail,

01:42:18.020 --> 01:42:20.700
but not too much yet.

01:42:20.700 --> 01:42:25.460
I think a true PDR should be at
the system architectural level,

01:42:25.460 --> 01:42:28.970
with some detail but
not all the details.

01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:29.570
But thank you.

01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:33.110
That's a great comment.

01:42:33.110 --> 01:42:35.250
Thank you very much.

01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:37.560
So let me close it here.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:42.050
So in terms of concept selection
during conceptual design,

01:42:42.050 --> 01:42:45.830
we can use Pugh
matrix selection.

01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:49.130
And that's essentially
useful when we don't yet

01:42:49.130 --> 01:42:51.470
have those detailed
mathematical models.

01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:53.030
It's qualitative.

01:42:53.030 --> 01:42:56.780
And then as we move more
into preliminary design,

01:42:56.780 --> 01:43:00.740
we use utility analysis,
especially for noncommercial

01:43:00.740 --> 01:43:04.210
systems where a net present
value-- a financial--

01:43:04.210 --> 01:43:06.500
in commercial companies,
you will often

01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:10.010
do a financial analysis
as a measure of utility.

01:43:10.010 --> 01:43:12.290
And then this concept
of non-dominance

01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:13.700
is very, very important.

01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:16.550
Generating many designs
and then applying

01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:21.050
Pareto filters to try to come
down to the non-dominated set.

01:43:21.050 --> 01:43:23.940
So that's essentially
the essence of it.

01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:27.390
So I hope that was clear.

01:43:27.390 --> 01:43:30.440
A-4 will be posted later today.

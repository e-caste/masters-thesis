00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.370
GILBERT STRANG: OK,
in this second part,

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.470
I'm going to start with linear
equations, A times x equal b.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.770
And you see actually, the
first real good starting point

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.230
is A times x equals 0.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:35.800
So are there any solutions to
the matrix, any combinations

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.250
of the columns that
give 0, any solutions

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.470
to A times x equals 0?

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.920
Now, I'm multiplying a matrix
A by a vector x in a way

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.170
you'll know.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.925
I take rows of x times,
it's called a dot product.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.000
Rows of A times x.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.580
So I have a row of numbers.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.650
And x is a column of numbers.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.150
I multiply those numbers and
add to get the dot product.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.630
And I'm wondering,
can I get 0 for each?

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.380
Is every row-- so
having a 0 there

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.490
is telling me, in geometry,
that that row is perpendicular,

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.130
orthogonal to that column.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.730
If a row dot product
with a column

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.290
gives me a 0, then in
n dimensional space,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:41.580
that row is perpendicular, 90
degree angle to that column x.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.120
So I'm looking to see,
are there any vectors x

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.120
that are perpendicular
to all the rows?

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.750
That's what Ax equals
0 is asking for.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.220
Oh, and that's what I've
just said right there.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.840
I've used the word orthogonal.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.910
That's more of a high level
word than perpendicular.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.600
So I'll stay with that.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.320
It sounds a little cooler.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.040
OK.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.770
And now, we can also
look at that transpose.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.710
Oh, do you know what the
transpose of a matrix is?

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.370
I take those rows
and flip the matrix,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.460
so that those rows
become the columns.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.630
And the columns of A become
the rows of A transpose.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.350
So I'll look at A
transpose times--

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.180
we'll call it y for
the new problem.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.940
A transpose y is all 0s.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.490
And then the null space will
be any vector, any solutions,

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.440
any y that's perpendicular
to the rows of A transpose.

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.140
So I would need couple of hours
of teaching to develop this

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.630
properly because
we're talking here

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:56.570
about the fundamental theorem of
linear algebra, which tells me

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.090
that the vectors
in the null space,

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.830
like that, are perpendicular
to the vectors.

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.740
These guys are.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.470
That's the row space.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.170
Oh, but maybe I have told you.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.820
We've said that, from this
equation, that tells you

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.330
the geometry that
that row vectors are

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.240
perpendicular to the x vector,
the thing in the null space.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.580
So x is there.

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.570
The rows are there.

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.370
And they're perpendicular.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.850
Now, if I transpose
the matrix, remember

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.010
that means exchanging
rows and columns,

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.460
so I have a new
matrix, new size even.

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.620
It will the same--
but it's a matrix.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.540
The same will be true for it.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:45.290
The rows become the columns.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.360
And the solutions to the new
equation with A transpose

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.940
go in that space.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.100
So then that little
perpendicular sign

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.770
is reminding us of the geometry.

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.550
So rows perpendicular
to the x's.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.710
Columns perpendicular
to the y's.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.430
That's the best.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.130
I finally saw the
right way to say that.

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.380
So I have two pairs.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:14.600
And I know how big each
of those four things are.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.459
Those are the four fundamental
subspaces, two null spaces,

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.690
two solution spaces with 0.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:24.980
Null means 0.

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.350
So these x's are in the null
space because of that 0.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.450
Those are the n's.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.170
And then this is the column
space and the row space.

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:40.130
So we've got four spaces
altogether, two pairs.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.930
And now, you get to
see the big picture

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:45.530
of linear algebra, where the
four fundamental subspaces do

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.040
their thing.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.910
There you go.

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.850
You can die happy now.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:56.190
The row spaces there, those
are rows of the matrix,

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.060
independent rows of the matrix.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.030
That's why I don't
put in all the rows.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.230
There are m rows.

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:04.570
But I only put in
independent ones.

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:08.590
So that might be a smaller
number r, r the rank.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:12.100
And here are the solutions,
the guys perpendicular to them.

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.270
This is the rows of the matrix.

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.900
These are the vectors
perpendicular to it.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.920
These are the columns
of the matrix.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.730
These are the vectors
perpendicular to the columns.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.220
You see it's just
a natural splitting

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:31.580
of the whole spaces of vectors
into two pieces and two pieces.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.680
And I think of the matrix A,
when it multiplies stuff there,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.570
it gives stuff here.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.440
When A multiplies
a vector x, you

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.910
get a combination
of the columns.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.310
That with the very,
very first slide.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.150
A times x is a combination
of the columns.

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.390
And then we look at
some x's, if there are

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.890
any, where A times x gives 0.

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:59.650
And there's 0 right there.

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:01.350
OK.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.010
OK, so that's the big picture.

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.040
And I'll just point to
another little point

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.700
that's hiding in this picture.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.280
You see that little symbol
there, that little thing,

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.580
and it's also here?

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.120
What that means is
that those guys are

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.190
perpendicular to these.

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.840
And these are
perpendicular to these.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.880
So we have four subspaces, two
pairs, two perpendicular pairs.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:32.070
And that's when you get the
idea of knowing what they mean,

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.270
knowing how to find them,
at least for a small matrix,

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:41.700
you've got the heart of
linear algebra part one.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.230
This is the first half
of linear algebra.

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:47.040
OK, I'll just see
what else there is.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:51.840
Oh, here, oh, well,
this is another comment.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:55.470
I've hardly told you how
to multiply two matrices.

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.980
The usual way is
rows times columns.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.030
But linear algebra being
always interesting,

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.490
there's another
way that I happen

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.840
to like, columns times rows.

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:12.690
Now, there is a
column times a row.

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.860
Now, column times a row,
we've seen that once

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.820
for that rank one matrix.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.240
Do you remember I said
that those rank one

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.020
matrix, one column times is one
row are the building blocks?

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.580
Well, here is the building.

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.660
Those are n of those blocks.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.640
A column times a row,
a column times a row.

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.730
And here is a reminder of the--

00:07:35.730 --> 00:07:38.160
oh, we've only--
oh, we're coming up

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:41.520
to A equal LU, the first one.

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:44.600
Get on with it,
Professor Strang.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.570
OK.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.700
OK, now we're solving equations.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:53.180
Now we're going to get
L times U. So right.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.140
So there's two equations and two
unknowns solved in high school

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.160
and how.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.300
Do you remember how?

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:01.800
That's the whole point.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:08.320
If I take twice that equation,
so it's 4x plus 6y equal 14,

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.110
and subtract from
this one, then I

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.980
get an easy equation
for only y by itself.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.030
So that's what I did.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:17.310
That's called elimination.

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:19.290
I eliminated this 4x.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:21.030
It's gone.

00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:23.400
It's 2 times that.

00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.550
That's why I chose
to multiply it by 2.

00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:30.000
Then 2 times this
gives me 4 x's.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.250
When I subtract it, it's gone
and I'm left with 1y equal 1.

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.980
So I know the answer y equal 1.

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:43.080
And then I go backwards to
x equal 2 because 2x plus,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.900
this is now, 3 equals 7.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:46.830
2x is 4.

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.900
x is 2.

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:55.500
And the real point
about linear algebra

00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.790
done right is that
all those steps

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.510
can be expressed as a
break up, another way

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:09.860
to break up the matrix A into
a lower triangular matrix.

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.100
You see that that
matrix is triangular.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.720
It's lower triangular.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.430
And this one is
upper triangular.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:18.790
So those are called
L and U. Yeah, yeah.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:24.820
So what we did here is expressed
by that matrix multiplication.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.550
You really want to express
everything, in the end,

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:30.190
as multiplying a
couple of matrices.

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.370
Then you know exactly
where you are.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.340
So that's the idea
of elimination.

00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:41.450
And now, we only were
doing a 2 by 2 matrix.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:46.660
You remember our little matrix
was pathetic, 2, 3, 4, 7.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.110
That was our matrix A.
We can't stop there.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:55.550
So linear algebra goes
on to matrix of any size.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:10:00.980
And this is the way
to find the triangular

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.920
factor L and the upper
triangular factor

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.730
U. That would need more time.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:12.560
So all I want to say is,
when you're doing elimination

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:16.490
solving equations, then
in the back of your mind

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:23.320
or in the back page, you are
producing an L matrix lower

00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:25.700
and a U matrix upper.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.550
So yeah.

00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:29.170
Let me see.

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:30.470
Yeah, here we see them.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:35.150
The L matrix is all 0s above.

00:10:35.150 --> 00:10:37.670
The U matrix is all 0s below.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:42.080
And that's what is
really happening.

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.470
So that's what computer
system totally focuses on.

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:50.150
OK, that's the first
slide of a new part.

00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:54.470
So I'll stop here and coming
back to orthogonal vectors.

00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:56.020
Good.

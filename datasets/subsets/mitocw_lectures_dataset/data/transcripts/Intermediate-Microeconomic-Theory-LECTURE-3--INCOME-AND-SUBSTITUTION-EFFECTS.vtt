ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: Let me
remind you from the reading

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.570 align:middle line:90%
list where we are.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.660 align:middle line:84%
We did the introductory
lecture, of course,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.170 align:middle line:90%
about economic science.

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.490 align:middle line:84%
And last time, we did our
first nuts and bolts lecture

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:31.160 align:middle line:84%
on preferences, consumer theory,
with the associated starred

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.600 align:middle line:90%
readings.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.020 align:middle line:84%
And today, we're
going to do more

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.710 align:middle line:84%
the way we ended the last
class on consumer behavior.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.980 align:middle line:84%
I'm showing this reading
list because I just

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.430 align:middle line:84%
want to remind you that these
starred articles do exist.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.010 align:middle line:84%
The Nicholson and
Schneider chapter 5,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.530 align:middle line:84%
from which this is drawn,
although not entirely.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.440 align:middle line:84%
And also, this Jensen
and Miller paper,

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.610 align:middle line:84%
which I will say a few words
about today because it fits

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.610 align:middle line:84%
into this lecture, but
also, as I probably

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.129 align:middle line:84%
mentioned too many
times, that's also

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.750 align:middle line:84%
a big part of your first
problem set and involves

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.370 align:middle line:84%
getting that paper, reading the
yellow markings as highlights,

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.820 align:middle line:84%
accessing the data
that these guys used,

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.910 align:middle line:84%
and running through some
of their calculations.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.590 align:middle line:84%
So that's the part of
the starred readings

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.550 align:middle line:90%
for this lecture.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.690 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of the study
guide, Consumer Theory,

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
as I was alerting you
last time, there's

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.660 align:middle line:84%
a pretty good thorough review
of what you should have learned

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.410 align:middle line:84%
or are learning from
the topic of last time.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.570 align:middle line:84%
And I will not go
through all of this,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.910 align:middle line:84%
but I will ask a
few questions, get

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.150 align:middle line:84%
a few volunteers, maybe even
call on a couple of you.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.330 align:middle line:84%
So this one, give a plausible
example of a commodity point

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.400 align:middle line:84%
that could not be in a
typical consumption set.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And I'll take
volunteers on that.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.620 align:middle line:84%
It's partly remembering
the slide where I showed

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.419 align:middle line:90%
examples of consumption sets.

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:10.840 align:middle line:90%
Does anyone remember?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.692 align:middle line:90%
The question is-- yes?

00:02:13.692 --> 00:02:15.400 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: One infeasible
consumption site

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.940 align:middle line:84%
is consuming 25 hours in a
day or something like that.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.800 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: That's good.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.590 align:middle line:84%
Yep, that was one of
the diagrams where

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.630 align:middle line:84%
the amount of leisure
available for work or leisure,

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.330 align:middle line:90%
the sum could not exceed 25.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.130 align:middle line:84%
There was another one,
which you might not

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.530 align:middle line:84%
have thought of given
the way this is worded,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.310 align:middle line:84%
which is consumption of
bread in New York at noon

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.580 align:middle line:84%
and consumption in
Boston at noon of bread.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.710 align:middle line:84%
And you're not allowed to
have bread in the interior

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.040 align:middle line:84%
because you can't
consume simultaneously

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.790 align:middle line:90%
in both New York and Boston.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.220 align:middle line:90%
So that was another example.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.590 align:middle line:90%
But your answer was great.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
So can someone
volunteer to give me

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.870 align:middle line:84%
the definition of
local non-satiation?

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:07.830 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: That
means that there's

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.440 align:middle line:84%
in that-- so if you have a
bundle, in any neighborhood

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.890 align:middle line:84%
of that bundle, there is
some other bundle that's

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.230 align:middle line:84%
preferred to the bundle
you originally had.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.600 align:middle line:90%
There are no bliss points.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.180 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
That's right.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.360 align:middle line:90%
That's an excellent answer.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.920 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I can't remember
whether we did X or Y.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.380 align:middle line:84%
But for any X in
the consumption set,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.150 align:middle line:84%
there's some other Y,
no matter how close

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.430 align:middle line:84%
we are to X, which is
preferred to X and-- well,

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.500 align:middle line:84%
and Y has to be in
the consumption set.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:48.430 align:middle line:90%
So both things have to be true.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.250 align:middle line:84%
It has to be available in this
little ball or circle around X,

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:57.180 align:middle line:90%
and it has to be preferred.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.450 align:middle line:84%
And you gave a good
counter-example.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.980 align:middle line:84%
If there were a
bliss point, that

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.650 align:middle line:84%
means there's something
that is maximal utility

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.310 align:middle line:90%
among all possible points.

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:12.210 align:middle line:84%
So if we do a
circle around that,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.145 align:middle line:84%
everything else
would be inferior.

00:04:14.145 --> 00:04:16.850 align:middle line:90%


00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.529 align:middle line:84%
If you went beyond the bliss
point, northeast of it,

00:04:21.529 --> 00:04:24.860 align:middle line:84%
you have too much
of all the goods.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.240 align:middle line:84%
But then, ironically, you
also have local non-satiation

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.080 align:middle line:84%
because, given any point X,
there's another point Y, which

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.530 align:middle line:90%
involves less than both goods.

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:41.510 align:middle line:84%
That would be strictly
preferred because you're

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.150 align:middle line:90%
moving to the bliss point.

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.520 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, the point of
this little discussion

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
is that local non-satiation
and global non-satiation

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:54.500 align:middle line:90%
are two different things.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.120 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.610 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's-- what does it mean
for a preference relation to be

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.665 align:middle line:84%
represented by a
utility function?

00:05:02.665 --> 00:05:05.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.540 align:middle line:84%
Given a preference
relation, is the utility

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.420 align:middle line:84%
function that
represents it unique?

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.810 align:middle line:90%
Yes or no, and explain.

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.210 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so we say that
a utility function represents

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.370 align:middle line:84%
a preference if, for example,
for any consumption bundle, X,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:29.610 align:middle line:84%
any two consumption bundles, X
and Y, if X is preferred to Y,

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.040 align:middle line:84%
then U of X is
greater than U of Y.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.270 align:middle line:84%
And the utility
function is not unique.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.050 align:middle line:84%
It just has to respect the given
ordering of the preferences.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.800 align:middle line:84%
So we could have U, or
U squared, or U cubed,

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.550 align:middle line:90%
and all of those would work.

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.800 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: Excellent.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.860 align:middle line:90%
Perfect answer.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.635 align:middle line:84%
Any other comments or
questions about that?

00:05:51.635 --> 00:05:55.450 align:middle line:90%


00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.070 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.800 align:middle line:84%
On this slide, it
had said that it

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.520 align:middle line:84%
was unique only up to an order
preserving transformation.

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:08.030 align:middle line:84%
What exactly does
that, I guess, mean?

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.260 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: Well,
if you had three points,

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.360 align:middle line:84%
ordering them from
low to high in terms

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.730 align:middle line:90%
of preference relation--

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.560 align:middle line:84%
say, X1, X2, X3, where
X3 is preferred to X2

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.800 align:middle line:84%
is preferred to X1,
all we need to do

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.940 align:middle line:84%
is to assign a higher number
to the best one, a lower number

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.140 align:middle line:90%
to the intermediate one.

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:35.140 align:middle line:84%
So something like 15, 5, 1
preserves the rank ordering.

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.960 align:middle line:84%
Those are utility
number assignments.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:46.950 align:middle line:84%
But we could multiply by 2,
and then we have 30, 10, 2.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.810 align:middle line:84%
But we're still assigning
numbers from high to low

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.550 align:middle line:84%
to preserve the
same rank ordering.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:54.610 align:middle line:90%
Does that help?

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.610 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, thank you.

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:59.340 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: OK.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.540 align:middle line:90%
Yes, go on.

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:03.240 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Do you eventually
need to, I guess,

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.450 align:middle line:84%
reintroduce some
concept of magnitude--

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.160 align:middle line:84%
or not magnitude,
but have something

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.040 align:middle line:84%
beyond just ordering if you want
to start talking about gambling

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.420 align:middle line:90%
or expected value?

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.010 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
Yes, absolutely.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.810 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do
that in two lectures.

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:21.490 align:middle line:84%
So there, the utility
function will--

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:25.820 align:middle line:84%
the ordinal
representation matters.

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:29.840 align:middle line:84%
And the question will be, how
much more utility do you get

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:35.330 align:middle line:84%
or how much less, depending
on an adverse event?

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:42.150 align:middle line:84%
So that the curvature literally
represents your willingness

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.590 align:middle line:90%
to take gambles.

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.780 align:middle line:84%
Whereas with an
ordinal function,

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.610 align:middle line:90%
a linear function is fine.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.010 align:middle line:84%
Linear function
when you're facing

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.470 align:middle line:84%
gambles means
you're risk-neutral,

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:57.310 align:middle line:84%
and you just rank based
on expected values.

00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:58.583 align:middle line:90%
That's all a little bit early.

00:07:58.583 --> 00:07:59.500 align:middle line:90%
It's a great question.

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:03.280 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to get
there in two lectures.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.335 align:middle line:90%
We got time for one more here.

00:08:05.335 --> 00:08:09.000 align:middle line:90%


00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.060 align:middle line:84%
What does it mean for
preferences to be homothetic?

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.960 align:middle line:90%


00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:19.790 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: The MRS is just
depending on the ratio

00:08:19.790 --> 00:08:22.310 align:middle line:90%
of two goods, right?

00:08:22.310 --> 00:08:28.220 align:middle line:84%
Not depending on the absolute
quantity of each good.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.150 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
Yep, perfect.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:34.150 align:middle line:84%
Wow, I'm very happy,
very impressed.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Thank you, all.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.049 align:middle line:90%
That's tremendous.

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:40.120 align:middle line:84%
OK, so again, these are just
somewhat randomly selected.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.960 align:middle line:84%
I do go over these
before class to help

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.930 align:middle line:84%
me decide, since I
can't ask them all,

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.630 align:middle line:90%
which one I would ask in class.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:51.850 align:middle line:84%
There are some of these
that say draw a graph

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.610 align:middle line:90%
or so on and so forth.

00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:56.450 align:middle line:90%
So I didn't ask about those.

00:08:56.450 --> 00:09:00.520 align:middle line:84%
But none of them are
supposed to be terribly hard.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.290 align:middle line:84%
But it is always a good
review, at a minimum.

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:11.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, so today is a lecture
on income and substitution

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.370 align:middle line:90%
effects.

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:17.690 align:middle line:84%
Or really, it's about
consumer-maximizing behavior.

00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:24.890 align:middle line:84%
And so when we solve the
consumers utility maximization

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.740 align:middle line:84%
problem, we get individual
demand functions.

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:32.750 align:middle line:84%
It should say function
with an S because if there

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:36.830 align:middle line:84%
are n goods, little n, then
there's a demand for good 1,

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:40.320 align:middle line:90%
good 2, good n, and so on.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.580 align:middle line:84%
And what are the arguments
in these demand functions?

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:46.850 align:middle line:84%
The entire vector of
Prices, denoted P1

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.350 align:middle line:84%
through Pn, and
Income, denoted as I.

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:54.530 align:middle line:84%
And you can think about
prices and income denominated

00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:58.290 align:middle line:84%
in dollars or some
unit of account.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.720 align:middle line:84%
We're going to be
spending time looking

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.900 align:middle line:84%
at how the price of
good k changes when

00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.510 align:middle line:90%
we change the price of good k.

00:10:06.510 --> 00:10:11.610 align:middle line:84%
But of necessity, other goods
will be changing as well.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:16.500 align:middle line:84%
It's at best, the implicit
happenings in the diagrams.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.560 align:middle line:84%
So here is a little
bit of a repeat

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.750 align:middle line:90%
but expanded from last time.

00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:24.390 align:middle line:84%
We've got two goods
denoted, X and Y.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:30.270 align:middle line:84%
And this household has a certain
amount of income, I, say, I2.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.100 align:middle line:84%
If income were I2,
to this would be

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:37.800 align:middle line:84%
the budget line, which has
a slope of PX over PY minus.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.610 align:middle line:84%
And this is the tangency which
is the maximum utility point

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:46.680 align:middle line:84%
denoted X2,Y2, associated
with income I2.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.670 align:middle line:84%
What this diagram is
featuring, though,

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:51.090 align:middle line:90%
is not a single maximization.

00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:55.120 align:middle line:84%
It's how the maximization point
changes if you increase income.

00:10:55.120 --> 00:11:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So you would move from
X2,Y2 to X3,Y3, for example.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.320 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, if your
income were less,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.540 align:middle line:84%
if this household's income were
less, they would move to Y1,X1.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.990 align:middle line:90%
So you could connect these dots.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.800 align:middle line:84%
And as only income is
varying and the price ratio

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.860 align:middle line:84%
is held fixed, we could
call the connected dots

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:21.990 align:middle line:90%
an income expansion path.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:26.160 align:middle line:84%
And I'll show you some
examples of that momentarily.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:29.400 align:middle line:90%
Here is a different experiment.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:30.720 align:middle line:90%
Did we miss something?

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.970 align:middle line:84%
Well, in this one,
you'll get lulled

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:36.370 align:middle line:84%
into thinking that,
as income changes,

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:84%
the amount spent on both
goods has to change, increase.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.860 align:middle line:84%
But that's not
necessarily the case.

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:48.100 align:middle line:84%
So here, again, we're
going from I1 to I2 to I3

00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:56.230 align:middle line:84%
and tracing out the quantities
from ZY1, ZY2 to ZY3.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:12:02.350 align:middle line:84%
And here, the quantity demanded
of good Y is increasing,

00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:06.500 align:middle line:84%
but the quantity demanded of
good Z is actually decreasing.

00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.300 align:middle line:84%
So there's nothing terribly
peculiar about the shape

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.760 align:middle line:90%
of these indifference curves.

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.040 align:middle line:84%
We didn't have to struggle too
hard to get this phenomenon

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.270 align:middle line:90%
to happen.

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.330 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, this
phenomenon has a name.

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:24.850 align:middle line:84%
Namely, the good Y over here
would be called a normal good,

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:30.820 align:middle line:84%
and good Z would be called an
inferior good or a necessity

00:12:30.820 --> 00:12:32.980 align:middle line:84%
because the amount
that you consume of it

00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:37.190 align:middle line:90%
diminishes as income goes up.

00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:39.940 align:middle line:84%
So here are those
definitions, a good

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.390 align:middle line:84%
for which the demand
of good i goes down

00:12:43.390 --> 00:12:48.130 align:middle line:84%
as income-- capital I-- goes up
is said to be an inferior good.

00:12:48.130 --> 00:12:51.970 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't have to happen over
the entire range of income

00:12:51.970 --> 00:12:52.870 align:middle line:90%
and prices.

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:56.300 align:middle line:84%
But if it happens locally,
it's called an inferior good

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:56.800 align:middle line:90%
locally.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:59.920 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, if the derivative
with respect to income

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.770 align:middle line:84%
is positive, then we
call, in some range,

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:07.370 align:middle line:84%
the good to be a normal
good or noninferior good.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's something
called Engel's Law.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.970 align:middle line:84%
And with the caveat that
this is not one household,

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.420 align:middle line:84%
it's actually comparing
across households that

00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:20.250 align:middle line:90%
differ in their annual income.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:26.540 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're going from
an annual income of $225

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.940 align:middle line:84%
to-- this is written
in 1920, by the way.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.110 align:middle line:90%
Don't be too alarmed.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:33.120 align:middle line:90%
There's been a lot of inflation.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.970 align:middle line:84%
So this, in real
purchasing power,

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:38.150 align:middle line:84%
was more than you
thought, $300--

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:44.210 align:middle line:84%
or this range, 450 to
600 or 750 to 1,000.

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.257 align:middle line:84%
And what you can
see is the percent

00:13:46.257 --> 00:13:52.220 align:middle line:84%
spent of the budget
on food declines

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.130 align:middle line:84%
as we move to
these income groups

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:57.000 align:middle line:90%
with higher and higher income.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.330 align:middle line:84%
So in some sense, if all
consumers were alike,

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.630 align:middle line:84%
and some had more
income than others,

00:14:02.630 --> 00:14:05.810 align:middle line:84%
we'd be looking at what an
individual household would

00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:08.670 align:middle line:90%
do as its income changed.

00:14:08.670 --> 00:14:11.750 align:middle line:84%
And in this case, food
would be an inferior good.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:13.130 align:middle line:90%
You're saying, what's going up?

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:15.350 align:middle line:90%
Clothing, not by much.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:17.720 align:middle line:90%
Lodging, not at all.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.480 align:middle line:84%
What really expands
as income goes up

00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.190 align:middle line:84%
is services, education, health,
legal, and other services.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:27.110 align:middle line:84%
In fact, in the US
economy, looking

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:32.150 align:middle line:84%
over decades, the fraction
of services produced in GDP

00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:33.720 align:middle line:84%
just keeps going
up, and up, and up,

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:36.710 align:middle line:84%
which is reflective of the
fact that, as households

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.085 align:middle line:84%
have more income, they demand
more services than less food.

00:14:40.085 --> 00:14:42.760 align:middle line:90%


00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.740 align:middle line:90%
So that's pretty dated, 1920.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So I went on the web and looked
this thing up, Engel's Law

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.750 align:middle line:90%
today.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:52.900 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're dividing
households into quintiles,

00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:57.440 align:middle line:84%
five groups, an equal number
of households in each group.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.600 align:middle line:84%
And we plot the fraction
of so-called luxuries

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.800 align:middle line:90%
and necessities for each group.

00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.190 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a bit
problematic in the sense

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:09.400 align:middle line:84%
that necessities are
defined as goods or services

00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.970 align:middle line:84%
where consumption is
proportionately lower

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.050 align:middle line:90%
as a person's income increases.

00:15:15.050 --> 00:15:18.580 align:middle line:84%
So again, necessity
or non-normal goods

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.790 align:middle line:84%
or as we defined it in
the last three slides.

00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:25.480 align:middle line:84%
Not too surprisingly, the
highest income groups,

00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:30.400 align:middle line:84%
the top 20% of the population,
the proportion of expenditure

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.880 align:middle line:84%
on luxuries is a lot
higher than on necessities.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.030 align:middle line:84%
And that gap lowers
until you get

00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:40.010 align:middle line:84%
to the lowest group,
in which case,

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:42.520 align:middle line:84%
the fraction spent
on necessities

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.460 align:middle line:90%
is a lot higher than luxuries.

00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.800 align:middle line:84%
Now, when I grabbed this,
there was an whole article

00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:50.470 align:middle line:84%
about how poor people
are extravagant

00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:53.560 align:middle line:84%
because they're still spending
money on luxury goods.

00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.340 align:middle line:84%
Well, I mean, narrowly
speaking, yes, that's true.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.933 align:middle line:84%
But again, it's a
little bit harsh

00:15:58.933 --> 00:16:00.850 align:middle line:84%
because it doesn't mean
they're driving around

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:01.990 align:middle line:90%
in a Mercedes Benz.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:05.050 align:middle line:84%
It just means they're
eating some fraction of what

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:08.650 align:middle line:90%
they spend on are normal goods.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:10.840 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Wait.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:17.960 align:middle line:84%
Can you-- is there a little bit
of issue with how those two--

00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.840 align:middle line:84%
I guess, how the two
lines are defined?

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:22.420 align:middle line:84%
Because the way
you defined them,

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.390 align:middle line:84%
it seems like you said luxuries
are just what rich people buy,

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:27.490 align:middle line:84%
and necessities are
what poor people buy.

00:16:27.490 --> 00:16:30.280 align:middle line:84%
So doesn't this kind
of get confirmed just

00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.300 align:middle line:90%
by how you define it?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.550 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: Yes, I
think that's exactly right.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.710 align:middle line:90%
It's almost tautological.

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.480 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the way
they defined it, it

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.110 align:middle line:84%
has to be true that this blue
line is going up and up as you

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:42.940 align:middle line:90%
go across the quantiles.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:44.440 align:middle line:90%
So I agree with that comment.

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.990 align:middle line:90%
But I still think the graphs--

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.430 align:middle line:84%
how much is it going up,
what's the difference,

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:52.030 align:middle line:84%
and so on, could go up
just a teeny little bit,

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.630 align:middle line:84%
in which case, that blue
line would not move much.

00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:59.040 align:middle line:90%
Other questions?

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.330 align:middle line:84%
Well, one takeaway from
this is different households

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.990 align:middle line:84%
that differ in income do
not spend the same fraction

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.020 align:middle line:90%
of their money on goods.

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:13.829 align:middle line:84%
So let me take a
chance at the risk of--

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:16.319 align:middle line:84%
preview of coming
attractions, this

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:19.859 align:middle line:84%
is way back in lecture
18, where we're

00:17:19.859 --> 00:17:24.270 align:middle line:84%
going to talk about aggregation,
which has to do with whether we

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:27.569 align:middle line:84%
can represent demand
functions as if they came

00:17:27.569 --> 00:17:30.900 align:middle line:84%
from a single maximizing
representative

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.830 align:middle line:84%
household or weaker, that
there is a group of households,

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:37.770 align:middle line:84%
like the lower quintile,
and they're all alike.

00:17:37.770 --> 00:17:40.920 align:middle line:84%
And we could take a
representative low-quintile

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.260 align:middle line:84%
household and talk
about the demand

00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.470 align:middle line:84%
as if it were coming
from that one person.

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:49.290 align:middle line:84%
What is a necessary and
sufficient assumption

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.770 align:middle line:84%
for us to be able to do
that kind of aggregation?

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:54.810 align:middle line:90%
It is that these income--

00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.540 align:middle line:84%
in this case, denoted
wealth expansion paths--

00:17:57.540 --> 00:18:02.650 align:middle line:84%
are linear and have
exactly the same slope.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.100 align:middle line:90%
So these guys will spend--

00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:07.890 align:middle line:84%
and I'm not trying to go
through the entire lecture.

00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:10.080 align:middle line:84%
I'm just really
trying to motivate you

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.070 align:middle line:84%
that we looked at
some micro data,

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:13.980 align:middle line:84%
and later, we'll make
some assumptions.

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.160 align:middle line:84%
It's good to put the microdata
about the assumptions

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:21.090 align:middle line:84%
on the table at the same
time and compare them.

00:18:21.090 --> 00:18:24.840 align:middle line:84%
What's going on here is that,
if these income expansion

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.890 align:middle line:84%
paths are parallel, then
when we increase income

00:18:28.890 --> 00:18:31.980 align:middle line:84%
for one household, it's
expenditure would go up.

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.330 align:middle line:84%
But because this
line is parallel,

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.320 align:middle line:84%
when we decrease
expenditure for another one,

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.860 align:middle line:84%
it's expenditures will go down
in exactly the same amount

00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:42.310 align:middle line:90%
that this guy's went up.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:45.060 align:middle line:84%
So those income effects
are completely offsetting.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:48.990 align:middle line:84%
And that turns out to be
necessary and sufficient to add

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:50.970 align:middle line:84%
up all of income
and drive demand

00:18:50.970 --> 00:18:54.450 align:middle line:84%
as if we've given all of
income to one household.

00:18:54.450 --> 00:18:54.950 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.870 align:middle line:84%
Well, it was with
some trepidation

00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.030 align:middle line:84%
that I showed you
this picture, but I

00:18:59.030 --> 00:19:01.550 align:middle line:84%
thought you might like
to know what's coming.

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:04.390 align:middle line:84%
And we'll review all of
that when we get to 18.

00:19:04.390 --> 00:19:08.540 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about income
and substitution effects now.

00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:13.250 align:middle line:84%
Instead of changing income,
we want to change a price.

00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:16.460 align:middle line:84%
We're going to focus on
good X. We're going to look

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:22.270 align:middle line:84%
at an initial point,
which is Y*,X*.

00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:26.320 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
lower the price of good X

00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.660 align:middle line:90%
and not touch good Y.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:31.990 align:middle line:84%
One way to quickly
convince yourself

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:35.680 align:middle line:84%
that the diagram is correct
is that this point over here

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:38.410 align:middle line:84%
on the Y-axis is
taking all your income

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:41.770 align:middle line:84%
and devoting it to the purchase
of good Y. The price of Y

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:44.350 align:middle line:84%
hasn't changed, so this
point hasn't changed.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.530 align:middle line:84%
But the price of
X is going down.

00:19:47.530 --> 00:19:52.480 align:middle line:84%
And logically, the set of
things you can buy is expanding.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.180 align:middle line:84%
So this budget line
shifts to the right,

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.530 align:middle line:90%
but not in a parallel fashion.

00:19:57.530 --> 00:20:00.070 align:middle line:90%
So what is the new purchase?

00:20:00.070 --> 00:20:04.510 align:middle line:84%
The new purchase is a
tangency, Y** and X**.

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to break that
movement from the initial point

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:11.890 align:middle line:84%
to the subsequent
point into two pieces--

00:20:11.890 --> 00:20:16.760 align:middle line:84%
one, a price effect, and
two, an income effect.

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.840 align:middle line:84%
So since the price
of good X goes down,

00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:24.880 align:middle line:84%
PX over PY in absolute
value is going down.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.450 align:middle line:84%
So there's a new budget
line with a lower

00:20:28.450 --> 00:20:35.960 align:middle line:84%
slope that is pivoting on the
initial indifference curve, U1.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:41.240 align:middle line:84%
So setting aside income effects,
which we'll get to momentarily,

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:45.320 align:middle line:84%
the natural impact of
lowering the price of good X

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.080 align:middle line:84%
is to increase the
expenditure of good X

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.900 align:middle line:84%
and decrease the
expenditure of good Y.

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.210 align:middle line:84%
So that's called the
substitution effect.

00:20:53.210 --> 00:20:59.010 align:middle line:84%
And it's a movement from X*,Y*
to B. But in fact, of course,

00:20:59.010 --> 00:20:59.780 align:middle line:90%
income--

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.390 align:middle line:84%
effectively, purchasing
power has gone up.

00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:05.990 align:middle line:84%
Even though nominal income has
not moved, one good, at least,

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.040 align:middle line:90%
is cheaper.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.840 align:middle line:84%
So their effect of
income has gone up,

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.790 align:middle line:84%
and that's represented by
this parallel shift from B

00:21:13.790 --> 00:21:16.880 align:middle line:90%
to X**,Y**.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:19.400 align:middle line:84%
And that last bit
from B to there

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.420 align:middle line:90%
is called the income effect.

00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:27.650 align:middle line:84%
So the global movement is from
X* to X** with a corresponding

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:29.930 align:middle line:90%
movement from Y* to Y**.

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:34.340 align:middle line:84%
And it's broken into two pieces,
this substitution effect, which

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:37.670 align:middle line:84%
corresponds with movement
along the original indifference

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.520 align:middle line:84%
curve, and the income
effect of having higher

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.530 align:middle line:90%
effective purchasing power.

00:21:43.530 --> 00:21:45.050 align:middle line:90%
OK?

00:21:45.050 --> 00:21:47.180 align:middle line:84%
A lot of today's
lecture is just going

00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:49.940 align:middle line:90%
over this in various ways.

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:54.020 align:middle line:84%
You can get mesmerized
with the price decrease.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.170 align:middle line:90%
Here is a price increase.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:01.020 align:middle line:84%
They're starting
out with a tangency.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:06.940 align:middle line:84%
The price of good X still
goes, in this case, up.

00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:09.520 align:middle line:84%
Their purchasing
power goes down.

00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:13.270 align:middle line:84%
The budget line rotates from
this initial point, inward.

00:22:13.270 --> 00:22:17.020 align:middle line:90%


00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.150 align:middle line:84%
So the total demand of the
price increase is going down,

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.740 align:middle line:90%
a reduction in X.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.290 align:middle line:84%
But again, we can break
that into two pieces.

00:22:27.290 --> 00:22:31.120 align:middle line:84%
One is a substitution effect,
the movement away from good X--

00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:34.180 align:middle line:84%
because it has a higher
price relative to good Y--

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.200 align:middle line:84%
to point B. And now
we take into account

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.260 align:middle line:84%
the loss of effective
purchasing power, which

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:45.820 align:middle line:84%
is a shift in this budget line,
the dotted tangency line, which

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:51.910 align:middle line:84%
is tangent at B, to the
actual new, lower budget line.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So here, we denote the
combination of the substitution

00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:57.310 align:middle line:90%
and income effect.

00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:00.720 align:middle line:84%
This is really the previous
diagram in reverse.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:04.500 align:middle line:84%
But I think it's
useful to show both.

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:08.460 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we can also start
changing the price of Y. Let's

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:09.730 align:middle line:90%
not do that right away.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.050 align:middle line:90%
I'll come back to that later.

00:23:11.050 --> 00:23:15.450 align:middle line:84%
But the principles
remain the same.

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:19.980 align:middle line:84%
So let's construct
some demand curves,

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:23.040 align:middle line:84%
as in the equation
system we had initially.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:27.930 align:middle line:84%
If we keep lowering the price,
moving in this direction,

00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:31.730 align:middle line:90%
we trace out this tangency.

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:35.520 align:middle line:84%
And those will be the demand
at the associated prices.

00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:41.290 align:middle line:84%
So here, we have,
say, X prime at price,

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:48.110 align:middle line:84%
P prime, X double prime
at price P double prime--

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:51.230 align:middle line:84%
and this would have
been even better

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.400 align:middle line:84%
if these things were lined up
as they were intended to be--

00:23:55.400 --> 00:24:02.200 align:middle line:84%
X triple prime at
price P triple prime.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:09.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, price is going
down, and demand is going up.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:15.890 align:middle line:84%
Now, just to alert
you, I don't know

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.250 align:middle line:84%
where this got started,
with Marshall or whatever.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:23.510 align:middle line:84%
But usually, we plot Y
is a function of X, where

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:26.720 align:middle line:84%
X is on the Y-axis, and
Y, the dependent variable,

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:28.730 align:middle line:90%
is on the Y-axis.

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.740 align:middle line:84%
This is actually
plotted in reverse

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.400 align:middle line:84%
because we're varying price
as an exogenous variable

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.010 align:middle line:90%
and plotting the demand.

00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:38.310 align:middle line:90%
No big deal.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:41.000 align:middle line:84%
I don't think I can
plot it the other way.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.960 align:middle line:90%
Actually, I could.

00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:46.200 align:middle line:84%
But you'll see why
this can get confusing.

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.750 align:middle line:84%
I just thought I'd point
it out along the way.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.950 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:53.800 align:middle line:90%
Now we come to Giffen's Paradox.

00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.560 align:middle line:84%
If the income effect of a
price change is strong enough,

00:24:57.560 --> 00:25:00.220 align:middle line:84%
the change in the price
and the resulting change

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.500 align:middle line:84%
in the quantity
demanded could actually

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.200 align:middle line:90%
move in the same direction.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.750 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you
an example that's

00:25:06.750 --> 00:25:10.080 align:middle line:84%
attributed to Robert
Giffen, who claimed

00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:13.870 align:middle line:84%
to observe this in Ireland,
where they had a famine.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.220 align:middle line:84%
So the potato crop was failing,
and the price of potatoes

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:18.540 align:middle line:90%
was rising.

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:22.480 align:middle line:84%
And despite the rise in
price, people consumed more.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.540 align:middle line:84%
So the demand curve
was upward-sloping, not

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.130 align:middle line:90%
downward-sloping.

00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.820 align:middle line:84%
His explanation was, potatoes
are a big part of the budget.

00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:33.930 align:middle line:84%
When their price goes up, the
effect of income goes down.

00:25:33.930 --> 00:25:36.300 align:middle line:84%
And that income
effect dominates.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:40.470 align:middle line:84%
The lower income effect is what
lowers the demand for the good.

00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.400 align:middle line:84%
But in effect, prices
go up, and demand goes--

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.930 align:middle line:90%
well, income's going down.

00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:49.390 align:middle line:90%
But this good is a necessity.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:52.600 align:middle line:84%
So you get a negative
sign on the income effect,

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.330 align:middle line:90%
so the demand is going up.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:58.180 align:middle line:84%
So price and income are
going up at the same time.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.580 align:middle line:90%
It's a bit of a mouthful.

00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:00.780 align:middle line:90%
No pun intended.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.100 align:middle line:84%
Actually, this could
not have happened.

00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.460 align:middle line:84%
It would require
that potatoes be

00:26:05.460 --> 00:26:08.760 align:middle line:84%
an important part of the budget,
that potatoes be a necessity.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But what doesn't fit the facts
is, how are they consuming more

00:26:11.790 --> 00:26:14.970 align:middle line:84%
potatoes when, in fact,
there was a blight,

00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:18.580 align:middle line:84%
and there were no more
potatoes to be had?

00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:21.630 align:middle line:84%
So something doesn't
add up, literally.

00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:25.200 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, all intermediate
micro classes

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:29.940 align:middle line:84%
typically feature Giffen
goods and then move on.

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.070 align:middle line:84%
And you may be left
wondering if it ever

00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:33.750 align:middle line:90%
really happens in practice.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:39.270 align:middle line:84%
So searching around, I
discovered Jensen and Miller,

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:43.380 align:middle line:90%
who actually ran an experiment.

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:47.550 align:middle line:84%
So this is literally a
randomized controlled trial.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:50.700 align:middle line:84%
They went to China, two
different provinces,

00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.430 align:middle line:84%
looked at relatively
poor households,

00:26:53.430 --> 00:26:57.870 align:middle line:84%
and changed the price of
the staple food item that

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:00.480 align:middle line:90%
was a big part of their budget.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, in order to
make the comparison,

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:04.690 align:middle line:90%
you've got to change the price.

00:27:04.690 --> 00:27:07.120 align:middle line:84%
So it was a randomized
controlled trial,

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.710 align:middle line:84%
meaning, randomly, some
households were exposed

00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:13.350 align:middle line:84%
to a lower price because
they were given vouchers

00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
so that when they
went to the store,

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.660 align:middle line:84%
the sum of U unpaid
plus vouchers

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:20.715 align:middle line:90%
equaled the stated price.

00:27:20.715 --> 00:27:22.590 align:middle line:84%
But they didn't have to
pay for the vouchers.

00:27:22.590 --> 00:27:24.870 align:middle line:84%
So effectively, from
their point of view,

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:27.990 align:middle line:84%
the price was lowered,
given the vouchers.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:31.260 align:middle line:84%
And the control group
did not receive vouchers.

00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.800 align:middle line:84%
So the control group faced
the normal market price.

00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:37.080 align:middle line:84%
And what Jensen and
Miller are doing

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:84%
is comparing the control group
with the treatment group.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.430 align:middle line:84%
And what they discovered
was, in Hunan, in the South,

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:46.590 align:middle line:90%
rice was the staple good.

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:49.080 align:middle line:90%
In Guangzhou, it's wheat.

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:52.660 align:middle line:84%
They did surveys,
like Engel, before,

00:27:52.660 --> 00:27:56.010 align:middle line:84%
during, and after the subsidy
on both treatment and control

00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:56.740 align:middle line:90%
groups.

00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:00.660 align:middle line:84%
And they found strong evidence
that poor households in Hunan

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:03.990 align:middle line:84%
experienced this Giffen
behavior with respect to rice.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:07.980 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, when the
price of rice went down,

00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:11.460 align:middle line:84%
households reduced
their demand for rice.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.270 align:middle line:84%
The evidence was mixed
in the other province.

00:28:15.270 --> 00:28:20.190 align:middle line:84%
And I think I will choose not
to say very much about this.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.700 align:middle line:84%
There were groups, the very
poorest and the least poor

00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:27.300 align:middle line:84%
that responded in what you might
think to be the ordinary way,

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:28.200 align:middle line:90%
with price--

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.760 align:middle line:90%
with demand down-sloping.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:33.600 align:middle line:84%
But there was a group in the
middle between the very poorest

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:37.470 align:middle line:84%
and the least poor which
exhibited Giffen behavior.

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.950 align:middle line:84%
As it's written on the slide,
this is a bit of a mystery.

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:42.870 align:middle line:84%
Why is it that we're
getting this difference

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:46.830 align:middle line:84%
across the three groups,
or two groups plus one?

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:50.640 align:middle line:84%
And I leave that for you
because, again, the problem set

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.500 align:middle line:90%
features the entire article.

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.520 align:middle line:84%
We try to make it easy
by highlighting the text.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.280 align:middle line:84%
But somewhere in that
paper is a discussion

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:03.360 align:middle line:84%
of why this result, which is
a bit hard to interpret here,

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.770 align:middle line:90%
does happen.

00:29:04.770 --> 00:29:07.450 align:middle line:84%
The authors did give
it an interpretation.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So that's advertising to go
and grab that paper, which

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.510 align:middle line:90%
I think I already have.

00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.010 align:middle line:90%
Yes, question?

00:29:14.010 --> 00:29:18.390 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so is the
demand the amount of potatoes

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.790 align:middle line:84%
or rice you're consuming,
or the proportion

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:24.307 align:middle line:84%
that is of your income
that's increasing?

00:29:24.307 --> 00:29:25.890 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
It's the quantity.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:28.050 align:middle line:84%
But obviously, they
have the prices.

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:31.680 align:middle line:90%
So you can look at both.

00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.995 align:middle line:84%
But the definition we've been
using of a Giffen good, it's--

00:29:37.995 --> 00:29:41.780 align:middle line:90%


00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:44.500 align:middle line:90%
well, actually, it never showed.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:48.310 align:middle line:84%
But it is the quantity-- in this
case, the quantity of potatoes,

00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:49.945 align:middle line:90%
not expenditure on potatoes.

00:29:49.945 --> 00:29:56.660 align:middle line:90%


00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.240 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.750 align:middle line:84%
OK, so now I want to get
to something, effectively,

00:30:02.750 --> 00:30:06.650 align:middle line:84%
we've already been doing,
which is compensated

00:30:06.650 --> 00:30:10.390 align:middle line:90%
versus uncompensated demands.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:13.650 align:middle line:84%
So the uncompensated
demand is the total demand,

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:18.160 align:middle line:84%
sometimes called the Marshallian
demand from Marshall,

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.610 align:middle line:84%
who was an early
English economist.

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:23.130 align:middle line:84%
It shows the relationship
between price of the good

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:26.340 align:middle line:84%
and the quantity purchased,
assuming that all other prices

00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:28.230 align:middle line:90%
and income are held constant.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:31.200 align:middle line:84%
The compensated demand,
sometimes called the Hicksian

00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:34.860 align:middle line:84%
demand, shows the relationship
between price and quantity.

00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:38.070 align:middle line:84%
It continues to assume that
all the other prices are

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.730 align:middle line:90%
held fixed.

00:30:38.730 --> 00:30:42.580 align:middle line:84%
But instead of holding income
fixed, utility is held fixed.

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.820 align:middle line:84%
So to go back to
the earlier slides,

00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.790 align:middle line:84%
we were featuring the
substitution effect

00:30:47.790 --> 00:30:50.970 align:middle line:84%
as the movement along
an indifference curve--

00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:53.310 align:middle line:90%
i.e., holding utility fixed.

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.340 align:middle line:84%
So when we looked at how
much demand would change

00:30:56.340 --> 00:30:59.520 align:middle line:84%
one way or the other as a
function of the price change,

00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.930 align:middle line:84%
and we went along the initial
baseline indifference curve,

00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:07.880 align:middle line:90%
that was the compensated demand.

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.830 align:middle line:84%
So more dramatically, if
we fix the initial point

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:17.750 align:middle line:84%
and change the price, we
would be, for a lower price,

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:21.590 align:middle line:84%
pivoting along this
indifference curve, U2.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:26.570 align:middle line:84%
By construction, we keep
utility constant at U2.

00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:30.080 align:middle line:84%
And then plot the demands,
which are going up,

00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:32.990 align:middle line:84%
and we put that on the
price quantity diagram,

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:35.310 align:middle line:84%
and the demand curve
is sloping down.

00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:38.630 align:middle line:84%
But this is the Hicksian
demand at little h

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.140 align:middle line:90%
to remind us that it's Hicks.

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:47.710 align:middle line:84%
So putting both types of
demand on the same diagram,

00:31:47.710 --> 00:31:52.300 align:middle line:84%
we'd have the normal demand,
or the Marshallian demand,

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:54.860 align:middle line:90%
and h for the Hicksian demand.

00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:58.720 align:middle line:84%
So as price goes
down, demand goes up,

00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:01.730 align:middle line:84%
but the demand goes up
from two different effects.

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:05.530 align:middle line:84%
One is the substitution effect
holding utility constant,

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:09.470 align:middle line:84%
and that's a point on
the Hicksian demand.

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:13.480 align:middle line:84%
And then the rest of it is this
movement to the Marshallian

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.810 align:middle line:84%
demand, or ordinary demand,
which is the income effect that

00:32:16.810 --> 00:32:19.830 align:middle line:90%
comes from the lower price.

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:22.650 align:middle line:84%
And obviously, we can go
in the other direction.

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:28.500 align:middle line:84%
Starting here as a baseline,
if we increase the price,

00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:30.930 align:middle line:84%
we would pivot along
the indifference curve

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:34.210 align:middle line:84%
and get a lower demand due
to the substitution effect.

00:32:34.210 --> 00:32:36.330 align:middle line:84%
But effective income
has gone down,

00:32:36.330 --> 00:32:39.480 align:middle line:84%
so this negative
income effect kicks in,

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:41.710 align:middle line:90%
and demand is even less.

00:32:41.710 --> 00:32:45.930 align:middle line:84%
So kind of intuitively,
the Hicksian demand

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.950 align:middle line:84%
is steeper than the
ordinary demand curve

00:32:49.950 --> 00:32:53.850 align:middle line:84%
because it has included
those income effects.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.570 align:middle line:84%
Or putting in another way,
the ordinary demand curve

00:32:57.570 --> 00:33:00.990 align:middle line:84%
is, quote, flatter
with a lower slope

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:05.970 align:middle line:84%
because there's a more dramatic
larger change in the quantity

00:33:05.970 --> 00:33:07.740 align:middle line:90%
as we change the price.

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.960 align:middle line:84%
Either the income
effect is positive,

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:12.330 align:middle line:84%
and demand goes up all
the more, or the income

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:17.050 align:middle line:84%
effect is negative, and the
demand decreases all the more.

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:19.450 align:middle line:84%
So we could say-- be
careful about this--

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.850 align:middle line:84%
that, in some sense,
the ordinary demand

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:23.470 align:middle line:90%
curve is more elastic.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:28.140 align:middle line:84%
At least here, it has
a higher derivative.

00:33:28.140 --> 00:33:32.120 align:middle line:84%
So there's a
mathematical expression

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:35.060 align:middle line:84%
for the difference between
the Hicksian demand

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:37.250 align:middle line:90%
and the ordinary demand.

00:33:37.250 --> 00:33:41.000 align:middle line:84%
Namely, the derivative
of demand of good X

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.510 align:middle line:84%
as we change the price of X,
the slope of the ordinary demand

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:49.100 align:middle line:84%
curve, is first term,
the substitution effect

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:53.120 align:middle line:84%
of the price change, PX,
but then this income effect

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.290 align:middle line:90%
kicks in.

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.470 align:middle line:84%
And there's two pieces
to the income effect.

00:33:57.470 --> 00:34:01.970 align:middle line:84%
One has to do with how high
is the marginal change in X

00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:03.750 align:middle line:90%
as you change income.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:07.610 align:middle line:84%
The other is, how much X you
were eating to begin with.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.969 align:middle line:84%
Think of potatoes, and
so on, or those budget

00:34:10.969 --> 00:34:13.699 align:middle line:84%
shares, either Engel
or-- but this is X.

00:34:13.699 --> 00:34:15.030 align:middle line:90%
This is the quantity.

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:18.770 align:middle line:84%
So it looks, from this, since
we're subtracting-- say,

00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:22.080 align:middle line:84%
the income effect is
positive, and X is positive.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.420 align:middle line:84%
Then we're subtracting
a positive number.

00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.440 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like this minus
this must be lower than this.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.290 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like
the ordinary demand

00:34:30.290 --> 00:34:34.050 align:middle line:84%
should have a lower slope if
this equation is accurate.

00:34:34.050 --> 00:34:36.920 align:middle line:84%
But in fact, as I just said,
it's the other way around.

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.360 align:middle line:90%
Puzzle, puzzle, puzzle.

00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.560 align:middle line:90%
What's going on?

00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.920 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's this stupid
way that we traditionally

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:46.350 align:middle line:84%
plot the dependent
variable on the X-axis.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:50.989 align:middle line:84%
So this is dX/dP, the response
of the dependent variable

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:52.880 align:middle line:84%
to the independent
variable, which

00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.610 align:middle line:90%
is 1 over the slope of this.

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:58.790 align:middle line:84%
So this diagram is consistent
with this equation.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.510 align:middle line:84%
It just takes a little bit
of juggling to realize why.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:05.540 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this is called
Slutsky's equation.

00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:08.690 align:middle line:84%
And again, at the risk of
trying to do too much too

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.000 align:middle line:84%
fast, but on the
other hand, providing

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.280 align:middle line:84%
some motivation for
where we're going,

00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.670 align:middle line:84%
eventually, we'll get to
lecture 19 and talk about

00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:21.110 align:middle line:84%
whether there are retractable
restrictions on data, as

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.460 align:middle line:90%
in the science lecture.

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:23.570 align:middle line:90%
We have a model.

00:35:23.570 --> 00:35:25.430 align:middle line:84%
Does the model fit
the data or not?

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:27.920 align:middle line:90%
Can you even reject the model?

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:29.720 align:middle line:90%
Is it providing some guidance?

00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:33.390 align:middle line:84%
Or you can always tweak things,
so the model is always true.

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:36.680 align:middle line:84%
So this lecture 19
is about restrictions

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.270 align:middle line:90%
that can be tested.

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:42.260 align:middle line:84%
And there's something
called Slutsky, same guy,

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:45.470 align:middle line:84%
Slutsky's Decomposition
this equation is

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:48.170 align:middle line:84%
a generalization of the
one I was just showing you,

00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:51.200 align:middle line:84%
with the exception that
we put this substitution

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:54.320 align:middle line:84%
effect on the left and
the regular derivative

00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.170 align:middle line:90%
on the right.

00:35:55.170 --> 00:35:57.170 align:middle line:84%
So it looks like the
signs are changing.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:58.950 align:middle line:90%
This becomes a plus.

00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:02.390 align:middle line:84%
This is a generalization
in a number of respects.

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:05.450 align:middle line:84%
We're looking at the
demand for good L

00:36:05.450 --> 00:36:08.990 align:middle line:84%
as we change the price of
another good, good K, not

00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:12.440 align:middle line:84%
the own effect of one good
with respect to its own price,

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:14.690 align:middle line:90%
but a cross-partial derivative.

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Although we still have this
income effect over here,

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:20.330 align:middle line:84%
and we're still weighting it by
the initial quantity purchased.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So it turns out that
what we want to do

00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:27.500 align:middle line:90%
is ask whether observe demands--

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:30.650 align:middle line:90%
this guy, these guys, really--

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:33.720 align:middle line:84%
how demand is changing
with prices and income,

00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.010 align:middle line:84%
whether there are patterns
which could be rejected as being

00:36:37.010 --> 00:36:38.760 align:middle line:90%
inconsistent with a model.

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:40.910 align:middle line:84%
And the problem is
that the restrictions

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:44.060 align:middle line:84%
are on these Hicksian demands,
and we don't see those.

00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.440 align:middle line:90%
We see the regular demands.

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.720 align:middle line:84%
We don't see the
Hicksian demands.

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.240 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say more
about this in a minute.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.460 align:middle line:84%
It turns out that,
with some math,

00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.320 align:middle line:84%
you can actually
go back and forth

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.050 align:middle line:84%
between the regular demand
and the Hicksian in demand,

00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:58.670 align:middle line:90%
and there are restrictions.

00:36:58.670 --> 00:37:01.190 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, I'm
running an experiment

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.710 align:middle line:84%
now because I'm
showing you things

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:06.620 align:middle line:84%
that are more toward
the end of the class

00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.690 align:middle line:84%
set of lectures than
at the beginning.

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:12.410 align:middle line:84%
But since we're introducing
Slutsky's equation today,

00:37:12.410 --> 00:37:14.840 align:middle line:84%
I thought I'd show you that
we will come back to it

00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:17.600 align:middle line:84%
and use it in a
subsequent lecture.

00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.120 align:middle line:90%
This is a lot simpler notation.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:23.720 align:middle line:84%
And don't worry about either
the income expansion paths

00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:26.360 align:middle line:84%
or this generalization
of Slutsky.

00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:29.330 align:middle line:84%
That was meant to be a
preview of coming attractions

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:31.820 align:middle line:84%
and motivation, not something
you should be worried

00:37:31.820 --> 00:37:34.470 align:middle line:90%
about learning right away.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:38.180 align:middle line:84%
So now I want to introduce
something called duality.

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:41.120 align:middle line:84%
This looks like an
income expansion path.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.960 align:middle line:84%
As we increase income, we
get more and more points.

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:47.660 align:middle line:84%
I think this is identical
with the figure I showed you

00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:49.300 align:middle line:90%
earlier.

00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.760 align:middle line:84%
But I want to use it
for a different purpose.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:55.110 align:middle line:84%
I want to say, suppose
we're at this point

00:37:55.110 --> 00:37:58.470 align:middle line:84%
with this intermediate
income, I2.

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:02.190 align:middle line:84%
And we could be maximizing
utility subject to that income

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:04.620 align:middle line:90%
level holding prices fixed.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:09.720 align:middle line:84%
And X2,Y2 would be the
maximum point of utility.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.310 align:middle line:84%
But suppose we did a
different experiment.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:15.630 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we wanted to
achieve this utility

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:19.600 align:middle line:84%
level, U2, by spending
as little as possible.

00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.270 align:middle line:84%
The amount spent
would be captured

00:38:21.270 --> 00:38:23.850 align:middle line:84%
by these various
possible budget lines.

00:38:23.850 --> 00:38:27.480 align:middle line:84%
So something called a
minimizing expenditure problem,

00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:29.880 align:middle line:84%
minimal expenditure
problem, would

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.010 align:middle line:84%
be to find the
budget line, which

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:36.750 align:middle line:84%
is lowest, closest to 0,0,
and still allows the household

00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.030 align:middle line:90%
to get the utility level U2.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.940 align:middle line:90%
So at this point, it's clear.

00:38:41.940 --> 00:38:44.880 align:middle line:84%
You could think of this as
maximizing utility subject

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.300 align:middle line:84%
to a fixed budget or
minimizing the expenses to get

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.340 align:middle line:90%
to a fixed level of utility.

00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:53.650 align:middle line:84%
Both things are true and,
you can go back and forth.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:58.320 align:middle line:84%
And that is the essential
idea of duality.

00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:02.730 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's do it a bit
more with notation.

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:04.940 align:middle line:84%
Let's take a consumer
with a consumption

00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.540 align:middle line:84%
set in L-dimensional
commodity space

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:13.340 align:middle line:84%
with the preferences represented
by a continuous utility

00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.970 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:19.020 align:middle line:84%
And let's look at the
Utility Maximization Problem,

00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:22.980 align:middle line:84%
UMP for short,
which is to maximize

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:26.640 align:middle line:84%
utility subject to
being within the budget.

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:29.685 align:middle line:84%
So this says, choose a point
in the consumption set,

00:39:29.685 --> 00:39:35.790 align:middle line:84%
all of the positive [INAUDIBLE],,
which maximizes that utility

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:39.870 align:middle line:84%
function subject to, the points
under consideration have to be

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:43.080 align:middle line:84%
such that, when you take
the dot product of P and X,

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:48.570 align:middle line:84%
P1,X1 plus P2,X2, dot, dot,
dot, it cannot exceed wealth

00:39:48.570 --> 00:39:49.690 align:middle line:90%
or income.

00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:54.390 align:middle line:84%
So that's the utility
maximization problem.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:58.860 align:middle line:84%
The result of solving
the maximization problem

00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.320 align:middle line:84%
can be substituted
into utility--

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.440 align:middle line:84%
in other words, utility
at the maximal solution.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.160 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to call
that the value function

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.960 align:middle line:90%
or indirect utility function.

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:15.210 align:middle line:84%
Note that the maximized utility
is a function of the parameters

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:18.090 align:middle line:84%
or the exogenous
variables of the problem--

00:40:18.090 --> 00:40:23.620 align:middle line:84%
namely, the Price
vector, p, and Wealth, w.

00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Now, in contrast, the
Expenditure Minimization

00:40:27.550 --> 00:40:32.050 align:middle line:90%
Problem, EMP, is to--

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.990 align:middle line:84%
given a certain
level of utility--

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:41.180 align:middle line:84%
minimize expenditures,
the dot product P.X,

00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:45.640 align:middle line:84%
that allows you to achieve
at least that utility.

00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:46.940 align:middle line:90%
Getting more is fine.

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:50.050 align:middle line:84%
But in most of the
figures we show,

00:40:50.050 --> 00:40:51.580 align:middle line:90%
this will be at an equality.

00:40:51.580 --> 00:40:55.870 align:middle line:84%
But just like you could
spend less than your income

00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:58.300 align:middle line:84%
in principle, here,
you could achieve

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.070 align:middle line:90%
a higher level of utility.

00:41:00.070 --> 00:41:04.180 align:middle line:84%
But whatever you're doing here
in the expenditure minimization

00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.910 align:middle line:84%
problem, you're trying to
minimize total expenditures.

00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:13.070 align:middle line:84%
And we call the solution to
that the E for Expenditure--

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:16.580 align:middle line:84%
minimized expenditure
at the optimum--

00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:20.330 align:middle line:84%
is a function of the parameters
of the problem, the same price

00:41:20.330 --> 00:41:21.470 align:middle line:90%
vector p.

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:27.170 align:middle line:84%
But now what's taken as a
given is u, not w, but u.

00:41:27.170 --> 00:41:31.160 align:middle line:84%
So we'll have this notation for
value function and expenditure

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.240 align:middle line:90%
functions.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.480 align:middle line:84%
Expenditure functions and
demands, for that matter,

00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.460 align:middle line:90%
have certain properties.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:40.880 align:middle line:84%
It turns out, the expenditure
function is concave,

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:84%
and the derivative of the
expenditure function is demand.

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.680 align:middle line:84%
So when you take the second
derivative of demand,

00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:53.310 align:middle line:84%
it picks up the concavity of
the level expenditure function.

00:41:53.310 --> 00:41:56.660 align:middle line:84%
And that's why that
Slutsky equation

00:41:56.660 --> 00:41:59.810 align:middle line:84%
holds because we're
looking at the matrix

00:41:59.810 --> 00:42:02.680 align:middle line:84%
of second-order
conditions, effectively.

00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:05.950 align:middle line:84%
But again, just ignore
me if that's confusing.

00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:08.440 align:middle line:84%
We'll get there in
that lecture 19.

00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:12.190 align:middle line:84%
For now, I just want to
focus on this relationship,

00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:13.300 align:middle line:90%
this duality.

00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.460 align:middle line:84%
And there's a number
of ways to put it.

00:42:15.460 --> 00:42:17.830 align:middle line:84%
The notation is
surprisingly subtle.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:19.870 align:middle line:84%
But if you work
through it, it's fine.

00:42:19.870 --> 00:42:22.780 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we're given a
continuous utility function

00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:26.860 align:middle line:84%
representing locally nonsatiated
preferences with a consumption

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.530 align:middle line:84%
set, strictly
positive price vector.

00:42:29.530 --> 00:42:34.180 align:middle line:84%
If x* star is optimal under the
utility max problem for a given

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:38.410 align:middle line:84%
wealth at those prices, then x*
is optimal in the expenditure

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:42.880 align:middle line:84%
minimization problem when
the required utility level is

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:47.020 align:middle line:84%
the utility you achieve under
the utility maximization

00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.070 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:42:48.070 --> 00:42:51.500 align:middle line:84%
I showed you a picture of
that just a minute ago.

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.900 align:middle line:84%
And the minimized expenditure
when you solve the EMP

00:42:55.900 --> 00:43:01.270 align:middle line:84%
is exactly the wealth that you
had in the utility maximization

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:02.540 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:43:02.540 --> 00:43:03.800 align:middle line:90%
Let me go back.

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.510 align:middle line:90%
So I started here.

00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:08.710 align:middle line:84%
We had income I.
Prices were given.

00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:15.190 align:middle line:84%
You maximized utility, ended
up at U2, given I and P.

00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:22.000 align:middle line:84%
We had a certain optimizing
solution here called X2,Y2 that

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.060 align:middle line:84%
solves the utility
maximization problem.

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:30.550 align:middle line:84%
And then I said, what if we
fix the utility level instead

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:33.550 align:middle line:84%
and solve the expenditure
minimization problem, which

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:36.880 align:middle line:84%
is finding the expenditure
level earmarked by these budget

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:41.620 align:middle line:84%
lines, which is minimal and,
yet, allows us to achieve

00:43:41.620 --> 00:43:43.780 align:middle line:90%
the utility level U2.

00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:47.320 align:middle line:84%
So this budget line, which was
a budget line for the utility

00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:51.910 align:middle line:84%
maximization problem, is kind
of the minimized expenditure

00:43:51.910 --> 00:43:56.268 align:middle line:84%
line for the expenditure
minimization problem.

00:43:56.268 --> 00:43:56.810 align:middle line:90%
I don't know.

00:43:56.810 --> 00:43:59.180 align:middle line:84%
Maybe the picture
is just easier.

00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.520 align:middle line:90%
But the notation says that.

00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:04.230 align:middle line:84%
And it actually
goes the other way.

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:07.970 align:middle line:84%
If x* were solving the
expenditure minimization

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:13.430 align:middle line:84%
problem, when the required
utility level is parameter u

00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:16.580 align:middle line:90%
then x* is also optimal--

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:19.940 align:middle line:84%
the same x-- in the utility
maximization problem,

00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.220 align:middle line:84%
where we give the
guys wealth equal

00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:25.370 align:middle line:90%
to the minimized expenditure.

00:44:25.370 --> 00:44:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And when they solve the
utility maximization problem

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:32.150 align:middle line:84%
at that level of wealth,
they end up exactly

00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:35.720 align:middle line:84%
with the u we started with in
the expenditure minimization

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:38.410 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:42.400 align:middle line:84%
Relatedly-- and this is
the most compact notation

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.680 align:middle line:90%
of all that's kind of cool.

00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:47.710 align:middle line:84%
Another way to state
the proposition

00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:53.590 align:middle line:84%
is to say that, given equation
3, when we start, given a price

00:44:53.590 --> 00:44:58.000 align:middle line:84%
vector p, we are
fixing prices p,

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.240 align:middle line:84%
we give the guy
income or wealth, w.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:04.090 align:middle line:84%
We solve the utility
maximization problem.

00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:08.080 align:middle line:84%
We substitute the maximizing
demands into utility.

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.960 align:middle line:84%
We get the indirect
utility function.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:13.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, starting with
that level of utility,

00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.570 align:middle line:84%
we do the expenditure
minimization problem

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:19.240 align:middle line:84%
and the minimized
expenditures at that

00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:22.910 align:middle line:84%
the in particular utility
level is W all over again.

00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:24.655 align:middle line:84%
So it's like feeding
back to itself.

00:45:24.655 --> 00:45:28.110 align:middle line:90%


00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:32.550 align:middle line:84%
Likewise here, we start with
the parameterized level of u

00:45:32.550 --> 00:45:36.240 align:middle line:84%
in the expenditure minimization
problem, taking, again, p.

00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:37.980 align:middle line:90%
Vector p is given.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.240 align:middle line:84%
At that level u, we solve for
the minimized expenditure,

00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.970 align:middle line:90%
which we called e of p and u.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:48.810 align:middle line:84%
And if we take that minimized
expenditure and substituted it

00:45:48.810 --> 00:45:52.410 align:middle line:84%
as a wealth term and solve
the utility maximization

00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:54.810 align:middle line:84%
problem at that
wealth, we would get

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:57.450 align:middle line:84%
that the indirect
utility is exactly

00:45:57.450 --> 00:45:59.650 align:middle line:90%
the u that we started with.

00:45:59.650 --> 00:46:02.580 align:middle line:90%
So it is a bit of a mouthful.

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:05.670 align:middle line:84%
The notation is quite
compact, and you may just

00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:08.590 align:middle line:84%
have a white-out
moment when you see it.

00:46:08.590 --> 00:46:14.110 align:middle line:84%
But it is repeating in different
ways in related notation.

00:46:14.110 --> 00:46:19.110 align:middle line:84%
Oh, this also means that e and
v are inverses of one another

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:23.040 align:middle line:84%
in the sense that take e and
multiply by some imagined e

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.490 align:middle line:84%
inverse, and you'd get rid
of e on the left-hand side

00:46:26.490 --> 00:46:29.020 align:middle line:84%
and have an e inverse
on the right-hand side.

00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:31.410 align:middle line:84%
So you'd have the
value of function

00:46:31.410 --> 00:46:37.950 align:middle line:84%
is an inverse of v. Sorry,
I said that wrong, actually.

00:46:37.950 --> 00:46:42.660 align:middle line:84%
If you take e and get rid
of it by taking e inverse,

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:45.390 align:middle line:84%
when you take the inverse
of the expenditure function,

00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:47.760 align:middle line:84%
you end up with
a value function.

00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:51.300 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, when you take the
inverse of the value function,

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:54.300 align:middle line:84%
you'll end up with the
expenditure function.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:57.183 align:middle line:84%
OK, I said it
right at that time.

00:46:57.183 --> 00:46:57.975 align:middle line:90%
There's a question.

00:46:57.975 --> 00:47:02.865 align:middle line:90%


00:47:02.865 --> 00:47:05.498 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: You keep saying
indirect utility function--

00:47:05.498 --> 00:47:07.665 align:middle line:84%
or, I guess, what do you
mean when you say indirect?

00:47:07.665 --> 00:47:10.062 align:middle line:90%


00:47:10.062 --> 00:47:11.520 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND:
It has a label.

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.830 align:middle line:90%
I mean, v looks like value.

00:47:13.830 --> 00:47:15.090 align:middle line:90%
You say, value function.

00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:17.640 align:middle line:84%
But it's called the
indirect utility function

00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:18.808 align:middle line:90%
in the literature.

00:47:18.808 --> 00:47:19.350 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:47:19.350 --> 00:47:23.220 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT M. TOWNSEND: That's
the name that we give it.

00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:28.200 align:middle line:84%
So Hicksian Demand is solving
the expenditure minimization

00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:29.380 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:32.970 align:middle line:84%
And we have the Hicksian
demand or demand correspondence

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:34.980 align:middle line:84%
if there's more
than one solution.

00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.320 align:middle line:84%
And then the diagram, so
there's been a unique solution.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:40.590 align:middle line:84%
This looks like
it's a new slide.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:43.530 align:middle line:84%
But actually, right
from the very beginning,

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:46.200 align:middle line:84%
where we were talking about
price effects and income

00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:49.170 align:middle line:84%
effects, and we defined the
price effect as a substitution

00:47:49.170 --> 00:47:52.030 align:middle line:84%
effect, we were moving along
a given indifference curve.

00:47:52.030 --> 00:47:55.170 align:middle line:84%
So we were really talking about
Hicksian demands all along.

00:47:55.170 --> 00:47:57.480 align:middle line:84%
And again, for
the third time, we

00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.700 align:middle line:84%
have a different way
of stating the problem,

00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:05.220 align:middle line:84%
that the ordinary demand is
equal to the Hicksian demand

00:48:05.220 --> 00:48:07.410 align:middle line:84%
evaluated at a
utility level, which

00:48:07.410 --> 00:48:11.310 align:middle line:84%
is the indirect utility of the
utility maximization problem.

00:48:11.310 --> 00:48:14.130 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, for the
expenditure minimization

00:48:14.130 --> 00:48:15.030 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:20.320 align:middle line:84%
This is, as I've been saying,
true starting at this point.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:22.500 align:middle line:84%
You start looking at it
one way or the other.

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:26.240 align:middle line:84%
You end up with
exactly the same point.

00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.170 align:middle line:84%
But if we start actually
taking discrete changes,

00:48:30.170 --> 00:48:31.470 align:middle line:90%
things are a bit different.

00:48:31.470 --> 00:48:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we were actually
doing that at the beginning,

00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:35.000 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.330 align:middle line:84%
We were talking about
a non-trivial decrease

00:48:38.330 --> 00:48:41.780 align:middle line:90%
in the price of X.

00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:47.860 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about discrete
changes and compensated demand.

00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:49.360 align:middle line:90%
We start with p and w.

00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:55.540 align:middle line:84%
We have the maximized
demand, x, for that given w.

00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:59.350 align:middle line:84%
But we change p
from p to p prime.

00:48:59.350 --> 00:49:05.260 align:middle line:84%
Then w prime would, say, be
the minimized expenditure

00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:09.250 align:middle line:84%
at the level of utility,
u, the initial level

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:14.980 align:middle line:84%
of utility at the baseline but
with the new different price

00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:16.630 align:middle line:90%
vector, p prime.

00:49:16.630 --> 00:49:20.200 align:middle line:84%
And we call that new wealth
as opposed to old wealth.

00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.650 align:middle line:90%
Call it w prime.

00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:25.240 align:middle line:84%
So in words, that level
of income or wealth

00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:29.800 align:middle line:84%
w prime is the one that, under
the new price vector p prime,

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:34.480 align:middle line:84%
would minimize the expenses
at p prime of achieving

00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:35.860 align:middle line:90%
the old utility level.

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.390 align:middle line:84%
Remember, when we
change the price,

00:49:37.390 --> 00:49:40.030 align:middle line:84%
we just rotate it along
the indifference curve

00:49:40.030 --> 00:49:42.310 align:middle line:90%
going one way or the other.

00:49:42.310 --> 00:49:46.600 align:middle line:84%
That's all this English and
all this notation means.

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.050 align:middle line:84%
We're just compensating
the agent for the change

00:49:50.050 --> 00:49:52.980 align:middle line:90%
in purchasing power.

00:49:52.980 --> 00:49:56.540 align:middle line:84%
But of course, demand doesn't
stay constant because the new

00:49:56.540 --> 00:50:01.670 align:middle line:84%
demand, x*, will be different
as the prices are different.

00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:06.200 align:middle line:84%
And the Hicksian demand includes
the price substitution effect,

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.430 align:middle line:90%
is defined by it.

00:50:08.430 --> 00:50:13.200 align:middle line:84%
So the Hicksian demand, at the
old utility level and prices p

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:19.670 align:middle line:84%
prime, is different from the
original baseline purchase.

00:50:19.670 --> 00:50:22.910 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, if you understood the
income and substitution effects

00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:24.980 align:middle line:84%
at the beginning,
that's all this slide

00:50:24.980 --> 00:50:28.640 align:middle line:84%
is saying, where we have
nontrivial discrete changes

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:29.690 align:middle line:90%
in the price.

00:50:29.690 --> 00:50:32.420 align:middle line:90%
Here's the picture again.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:38.000 align:middle line:84%
But be forewarned that, somehow,
to make it more interesting,

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.990 align:middle line:84%
we're going to change the price
of good 2 instead of good 1.

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.580 align:middle line:84%
And we are going to
increase the price.

00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:54.740 align:middle line:84%
So the original baseline
budget is from w to w over p2.

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.720 align:middle line:90%
Why just w?

00:50:56.720 --> 00:51:00.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, there's an assumption
down here that we only

00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.280 align:middle line:90%
care about the price ratio.

00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:08.520 align:middle line:84%
So let's denominate everything
in units of good on the X-axis.

00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.390 align:middle line:90%
p1, the first good, equals 1.

00:51:12.390 --> 00:51:14.040 align:middle line:84%
So we don't need
to worry anymore

00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:17.328 align:middle line:84%
about the price of the
first good because it's 1.

00:51:17.328 --> 00:51:18.870 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, what's the price

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.990 align:middle line:84%
of the second good
relative to 1?

00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:26.920 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the price of the
second good, p2, is going up.

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:32.380 align:middle line:84%
So you would go from w
over p2 attainable to w

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:36.550 align:middle line:84%
over p2 prime attainable
when you go from a price p2

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:38.500 align:middle line:90%
to p2 prime.

00:51:38.500 --> 00:51:40.990 align:middle line:84%
This is like the
earlier diagram,

00:51:40.990 --> 00:51:43.720 align:middle line:84%
where we fixed a
point on the Y-axis

00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.130 align:middle line:90%
and pivoted on the X-axis.

00:51:46.130 --> 00:51:48.280 align:middle line:84%
But this is the other
way around because we're

00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.790 align:middle line:84%
changing the price of good 2
and not the price of good 1.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:55.510 align:middle line:90%


00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:59.680 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we start here, and we
have an income, a lower budget

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.640 align:middle line:90%
line.

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:03.790 align:middle line:84%
Now we want to break that
into two pieces, namely

00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:07.240 align:middle line:84%
the substitution effect
and the income effect.

00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.550 align:middle line:90%
What is the substitution effect?

00:52:09.550 --> 00:52:13.690 align:middle line:84%
At this higher price of
p2, it's p1, over p2,

00:52:13.690 --> 00:52:15.530 align:middle line:90%
If you remember the slope.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:19.070 align:middle line:84%
So as p2 goes up,
that slope goes down.

00:52:19.070 --> 00:52:22.720 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to rotate
along this indifference curve

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.480 align:middle line:84%
and effectively
maximize utility,

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.450 align:middle line:90%
which is giving you this point.

00:52:28.450 --> 00:52:31.570 align:middle line:84%
What's the maximum
utility you can get

00:52:31.570 --> 00:52:33.520 align:middle line:90%
or the minimized expenditure?

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.550 align:middle line:84%
Rotating along this
indifference curve.

00:52:36.550 --> 00:52:40.300 align:middle line:84%
And then the income effect
is moving from here,

00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.520 align:middle line:90%
a parallel shift back to here.

00:52:43.520 --> 00:52:49.300 align:middle line:84%
So our initial level of wealth,
w, was on this good 1 axis,

00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:54.820 align:middle line:84%
and our new level of wealth
is this minimized expenditure

00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:59.020 align:middle line:84%
at the new prices, p prime,
given utility level u.

00:52:59.020 --> 00:53:02.350 align:middle line:90%
So we've gone from w to w prime.

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:06.370 align:middle line:84%
That's the change in
wealth in terms of good 1.

00:53:06.370 --> 00:53:09.400 align:middle line:84%
Initial wealth, new
wealth in terms of good 1,

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:12.490 align:middle line:84%
this must therefore be
the change in wealth.

00:53:12.490 --> 00:53:16.370 align:middle line:84%
And that's the change in
wealth, which is positive,

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:18.110 align:middle line:84%
which you may have
been wondering about,

00:53:18.110 --> 00:53:21.940 align:middle line:84%
which is necessary to compensate
the agent for the fact

00:53:21.940 --> 00:53:24.710 align:middle line:84%
that the price of
good 2 has gone up.

00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:29.080 align:middle line:84%
We have to compensate the agent
for the adverse price change

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.560 align:middle line:84%
by giving him or
her more income.

00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:34.210 align:middle line:84%
And this is that
level of income.

00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:37.306 align:middle line:90%


00:53:37.306 --> 00:53:42.420 align:middle line:84%
OK, so as I keep saying, but
it's probably been more or less

00:53:42.420 --> 00:53:44.700 align:middle line:84%
an abstract
statement, I'm really

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:48.150 align:middle line:84%
interested in real
economies, where

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:50.760 align:middle line:84%
we have something
going on over time,

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:54.510 align:middle line:84%
or something with the
geography, or something having

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:56.580 align:middle line:84%
to do with uncertainty,
and gambles,

00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.600 align:middle line:90%
and states of the world.

00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:03.150 align:middle line:84%
So having memorized or
shown you all those figures

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:05.730 align:middle line:84%
with some very interesting
concepts and a little bit

00:54:05.730 --> 00:54:09.120 align:middle line:84%
of data along the way,
one may, nevertheless,

00:54:09.120 --> 00:54:11.280 align:middle line:84%
walk away with the
impression that we're

00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.260 align:middle line:84%
talking about a
static world, where

00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:17.160 align:middle line:84%
we have rice and other goods
or potatoes and other goods.

00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:21.780 align:middle line:84%
And we're just comparing wheat
to apples as we change prices.

00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:26.010 align:middle line:84%
But no, the framework
applies to any goods,

00:54:26.010 --> 00:54:28.720 align:middle line:84%
including goods that
are earmarked by time.

00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:33.720 align:middle line:84%
So suppose we have
two time periods only.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.570 align:middle line:90%
And we'll call consumption C1--

00:54:36.570 --> 00:54:40.410 align:middle line:84%
consumption and date 1, and
C2, consumption and date 2.

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:44.130 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to give
income as an endowment,

00:54:44.130 --> 00:54:49.050 align:middle line:84%
meaning how much income they
have in the first date, 1,

00:54:49.050 --> 00:54:52.950 align:middle line:84%
and how much income they
have in the second date, 2.

00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:55.170 align:middle line:84%
Using income is
a bit tricky here

00:54:55.170 --> 00:54:58.740 align:middle line:84%
because we used that before
in the static optimization

00:54:58.740 --> 00:54:59.650 align:middle line:90%
problem.

00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.830 align:middle line:90%
So think of it as money, then--

00:55:01.830 --> 00:55:05.700 align:middle line:84%
money in date 1,
money at date 2.

00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:07.600 align:middle line:90%
Now, what is the budget line?

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.860 align:middle line:84%
Well, if they just
eat their money,

00:55:10.860 --> 00:55:14.070 align:middle line:84%
they would have consumption
equal to m1 and m2.

00:55:14.070 --> 00:55:17.200 align:middle line:84%
But the way this is drawn,
they don't want to do that.

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:20.700 align:middle line:84%
They want to move in one
direction or another.

00:55:20.700 --> 00:55:22.640 align:middle line:90%
So what is this budget line?

00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:26.060 align:middle line:84%
This budget line
reflects the possibility

00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:29.390 align:middle line:84%
of giving up money tomorrow
and getting more consumption

00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:30.440 align:middle line:90%
today--

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.980 align:middle line:84%
that's borrowing-- or
giving up money today

00:55:33.980 --> 00:55:37.340 align:middle line:84%
and getting more consumption
tomorrow-- that's lending.

00:55:37.340 --> 00:55:40.280 align:middle line:84%
So the slope of
this heavy blue line

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.850 align:middle line:84%
represents the tradeoff
of the price of goods

00:55:43.850 --> 00:55:47.300 align:middle line:84%
today for the price of good
tomorrow, which you knew

00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:49.460 align:middle line:90%
all along but probably forgot.

00:55:49.460 --> 00:55:50.030 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:55:50.030 --> 00:55:53.500 align:middle line:84%
Because the slope of the
budget line is p1 over p2--

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.300 align:middle line:84%
p1 being consumption
at date one, p2

00:55:56.300 --> 00:55:59.480 align:middle line:84%
to being-- sorry-- the price
of consumption at date two.

00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.130 align:middle line:84%
But the economics of the problem
doesn't write p1 over p2.

00:56:04.130 --> 00:56:06.690 align:middle line:90%
It writes r as an interest rate.

00:56:06.690 --> 00:56:08.150 align:middle line:90%
Why is it the interest rate?

00:56:08.150 --> 00:56:11.780 align:middle line:84%
Because if you gave up
some of your money today

00:56:11.780 --> 00:56:15.110 align:middle line:84%
and put it in the bank,
you would get the principal

00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:16.910 align:middle line:90%
and interest back tomorrow.

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:21.500 align:middle line:84%
So 1 plus r, which is also
the slope of this line,

00:56:21.500 --> 00:56:24.980 align:middle line:84%
reflects the tradeoff
between consumption today

00:56:24.980 --> 00:56:29.340 align:middle line:84%
and consumption tomorrow as made
possible by this interest rate.

00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:32.000 align:middle line:84%
So then, as per
the entire lecture,

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.070 align:middle line:90%
we try to change a price.

00:56:34.070 --> 00:56:36.540 align:middle line:84%
Over here, let's increase
the interest rate.

00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:40.130 align:middle line:84%
So it's still possible to eat
your money in both periods.

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.140 align:middle line:84%
But now that the interest
rate has gone up,

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:44.090 align:middle line:90%
the budget line is steeper.

00:56:44.090 --> 00:56:47.600 align:middle line:84%
For a given surrendering
of one unit of consumption

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.560 align:middle line:84%
today, you get a higher
1 plus r tomorrow.

00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:55.280 align:middle line:84%
So this paler blue line crosses
through the endowment point,

00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.300 align:middle line:90%
but it's steeper.

00:56:56.300 --> 00:56:59.240 align:middle line:84%
And as drawn with these
indifference curves,

00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:02.400 align:middle line:84%
the household would move from
this point to this point.

00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.590 align:middle line:84%
So let's talk about income
and substitution effects.

00:57:06.590 --> 00:57:11.360 align:middle line:84%
Consumption, tomorrow, at
date 2, goes up and up.

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.300 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.650 align:middle line:84%
Two effects, and they're both
moving in the same direction.

00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:17.270 align:middle line:84%
The increase in
the interest rate

00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:20.070 align:middle line:84%
effectively means
they have more income.

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:22.610 align:middle line:84%
They can take their
endowment of money tomorrow,

00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and it will be worth more.

00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So there's an income
effect associated

00:57:26.030 --> 00:57:28.130 align:middle line:90%
with the price change.

00:57:28.130 --> 00:57:30.720 align:middle line:84%
Not only that, there's
a substitution effect.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:31.370 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:57:31.370 --> 00:57:33.350 align:middle line:84%
Because as the
interest rate goes up,

00:57:33.350 --> 00:57:36.440 align:middle line:84%
the opportunity cost of
eating today goes up.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.380 align:middle line:84%
It's more painful to eat
today because you could

00:57:39.380 --> 00:57:42.290 align:middle line:84%
get even more tomorrow by
putting the money in the bank

00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:43.890 align:middle line:90%
at a higher interest rate.

00:57:43.890 --> 00:57:46.760 align:middle line:84%
So the substitution
effect moves them

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.260 align:middle line:84%
with these nice,
smooth indifference

00:57:48.260 --> 00:57:50.870 align:middle line:84%
curves away from
consumption today

00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:53.390 align:middle line:84%
toward higher
consumption tomorrow.

00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:56.420 align:middle line:84%
So the income and substitution
effects in this diagram

00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:59.060 align:middle line:84%
work in the same
direction for good 2,

00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:04.220 align:middle line:84%
but it's not true
for good 1 at date 1.

00:58:04.220 --> 00:58:06.860 align:middle line:84%
Or at least, it
could be ambiguous.

00:58:06.860 --> 00:58:08.090 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:58:08.090 --> 00:58:11.210 align:middle line:84%
There's an income effect, which
should increase consumption

00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:12.620 align:middle line:90%
at date 1.

00:58:12.620 --> 00:58:14.420 align:middle line:84%
But there's a price
effect, which should

00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.940 align:middle line:90%
decrease consumption at date 1.

00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:21.060 align:middle line:84%
And those can, in principle,
move in opposite directions.

00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:24.530 align:middle line:84%
In this case, date 1
consumption is going down,

00:58:24.530 --> 00:58:29.390 align:middle line:84%
so the substitution effect is
dominating the income effect.

00:58:29.390 --> 00:58:31.280 align:middle line:84%
But it didn't have
to go that way.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:33.380 align:middle line:84%
You could have drawn
the indifference curves

00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:36.260 align:middle line:84%
and gotten an increase in
the consumption of date

00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:37.580 align:middle line:90%
of that good.

00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:41.780 align:middle line:84%
OK, let's start out with a
different but related diagram.

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:45.230 align:middle line:84%
Suppose they have money today
and tomorrow as endowments.

00:58:45.230 --> 00:58:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And this guy is
actually doing what?

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:51.050 align:middle line:84%
Originally, borrowing,
getting more consumption today

00:58:51.050 --> 00:58:54.320 align:middle line:84%
than the money he or she has
at the expense of paying it

00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.270 align:middle line:84%
back with interest
tomorrow, therefore

00:58:56.270 --> 00:58:59.770 align:middle line:84%
having less consumption than the
money that he or she originally

00:58:59.770 --> 00:59:00.270 align:middle line:90%
had.

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:03.290 align:middle line:84%
So we'd end up
with this tangency.

00:59:03.290 --> 00:59:06.260 align:middle line:84%
And now we still increase
the interest rate.

00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:10.850 align:middle line:84%
That makes this pale
blue line steeper.

00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:14.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can see consumption
is moving inwards.

00:59:14.210 --> 00:59:17.540 align:middle line:84%
So actually, consumption of
both goods in the diagram

00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:18.720 align:middle line:90%
is going down.

00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:21.620 align:middle line:84%
But let's think about income
and substitution effects.

00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:24.200 align:middle line:84%
Because they were
borrowing originally,

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.750 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to
lending, intuitively,

00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:30.680 align:middle line:84%
an increase in the interest rate
is a bad situation for them.

00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:33.360 align:middle line:84%
They were borrowing, and now
the interest rate is higher.

00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:35.300 align:middle line:84%
So the income
effect is negative.

00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:38.250 align:middle line:84%
And that could show
up with both goods.

00:59:38.250 --> 00:59:40.220 align:middle line:84%
On the other hand, the
substitution effect

00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:43.160 align:middle line:84%
should still push them in the
direction of higher consumption

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:43.820 align:middle line:90%
tomorrow.

00:59:43.820 --> 00:59:46.140 align:middle line:90%
That's the substitution effect.

00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:49.130 align:middle line:84%
So for one of these
goods, consumption today

00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:50.240 align:middle line:90%
is unambiguous.

00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:52.700 align:middle line:84%
But consumption
tomorrow is ambiguous,

00:59:52.700 --> 00:59:55.160 align:middle line:84%
despite the way it's
drawn, because the income

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:58.590 align:middle line:84%
and substitution effects work
in the opposite direction.

00:59:58.590 --> 00:59:59.990 align:middle line:90%
So take a look at those.

00:59:59.990 --> 01:00:01.230 align:middle line:90%
There's a lot going on.

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:02.810 align:middle line:84%
In fact, that's
kind of the point,

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.570 align:middle line:84%
that when we move
from apples, wheats,

01:00:05.570 --> 01:00:09.230 align:middle line:84%
and so on with prices and
income to an applied problem,

01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:12.260 align:middle line:84%
like what's happening in
the US with these lower

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.810 align:middle line:84%
and lower interest
rates, well, if we

01:00:14.810 --> 01:00:17.900 align:middle line:84%
look at consumer behavior,
there's income effects.

01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:20.030 align:middle line:90%
There's substitution effects.

01:00:20.030 --> 01:00:22.820 align:middle line:84%
You can go in different
directions and be in conflict.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:26.180 align:middle line:84%
And that's an important part
of understanding the impact

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.790 align:middle line:84%
on the households and the
impact on the economy.

01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:31.370 align:middle line:84%
And it's actually
a lot more work

01:00:31.370 --> 01:00:33.290 align:middle line:84%
to go through this slide
and the previous one

01:00:33.290 --> 01:00:34.940 align:middle line:84%
than you might
have imagined, even

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:37.340 align:middle line:84%
though, say, you
were totally sure you

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.220 align:middle line:84%
could shift these curves around
in whatever way you wanted.

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.040 align:middle line:84%
When we get to the
economic application,

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.760 align:middle line:84%
we kind of do it all over again
with the new realistic labels.

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.610 align:middle line:90%
And it brings that tool to life.

01:00:50.610 --> 01:00:53.430 align:middle line:84%
OK, well, that's the
last slide for today.

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:56.430 align:middle line:90%
That's the end of this lecture.

01:00:56.430 --> 01:00:59.270 align:middle line:90%
All right, thank you very much.

01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:08.000 align:middle line:90%

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.680
PROFESSOR STRANG: You
can pick up the homeworks

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.470
after if you didn't get one.

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.350
And the good grade is five.

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:32.900
And the MATLABs are coming
in, that's all good.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:40.050
And I'll have some thoughts
about the MATLAB Monday.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.490
I wanted to say a little
more about finite differences

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.310
in time just because
they're so important.

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:53.080
And I got the idea of a forward
Euler and a backward Euler

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.160
but I want to give you a
couple of more possibilities

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.660
just so you see how finite
difference methods are created.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.470
And then I want to
get started on least

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.610
squares, the next major
topic, the next case

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.480
where A transpose A shows up
at the core of everything.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.040
So what we did with
finite differences

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.000
was this was our model
problem for one spring

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.030
and this is our model
problem for n springs

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.990
with n different masses.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.090
So this is like, scalar. u
is just a single unknown.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.530
Here u is a vector unknown.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.390
If I reduce things to like,
even this model problem,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.450
if I introduce the velocity,
because everybody's also

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.850
interested in
computing velocity,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.000
then the velocity is
u' and the equation

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.730
tells me that v' is minus u.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.620
So I have a system.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.780
Better to think in terms
of first order systems

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.550
because they include everything.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.590
So the first order
system there, do

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.580
you see what the matrix is
on that right-hand side?

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.350
I'm always seeing a matrix
that's multiplying [u, v].

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.360
So this would be our example
of this general set-up.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.330
This general set-up.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:24.680
First order systems, taking
them to be linear here.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.670
And then I better
say a little bit

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:34.110
about what happens when they're
not linear today and later.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.140
So this is my problem. du/dt=Au.

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.930
And the exact solution would
come from the eigenvalues

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.260
and eigenvectors of A. We would
have the e^(lambda*t)'s, giving

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.360
us the time growth or
decay or oscillation,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.960
times their eigenvectors.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:02.690
And a combination of those
would be the exact answer.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.620
So that's the general
method for using

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.190
eigenvalues and eigenvectors
to get exact solutions.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:15.620
I'm not speaking now
about exact solutions.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.880
I'm going to talk about
finite differences in time

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.630
because for more
general problems

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.550
I must expect to go
to finite differences.

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.870
I can't expect exact solutions
like pure cos(t) or sin(t).

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.330
So here's my problem,
model problem.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.980
Here is Euler's first idea.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.230
So idea one from Euler
was replace the derivative

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.860
by a finite difference taking
time steps forward in time

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:55.610
and use the equation
to tell you the slope

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:56.880
at the start of the step.

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.680
Do you see Euler's
equation there?

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.510
And that is definitely a
reasonable thing to start with.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.150
It's not very accurate.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.090
It's not perfectly stable.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.200
It doesn't preserve energy.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:22.160
We saw the answer spiraling
out but if you only

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.610
want to compute up
to a limited time

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.760
you could use it with a
pretty small time step.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.190
But you can do better.

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:36.950
Now backward Euler
was the other way.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.150
So it's just the contrast of
the two that you want to see.

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.880
Neither one is an
outstanding method.

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.170
They're both only
first order accurate.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:54.010
So backward Euler,
this time step in time

00:04:54.010 --> 00:05:00.470
is still the difference that
replaces the derivative.

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.130
But now everybody notices
the big difference.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:08.110
The slope is being computed
at the end of the time step.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:09.520
And that's more stable.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.480
That's the one that spiraled in.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:21.580
And I would call
this method explicit.

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.620
What does explicit mean?

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.960
It means that I can
find u_(n+1) directly.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.170
This method I would
call implicit.

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.610
And what does implicit mean?

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:37.020
Implicit means that u_(n+1)
is appearing on the right-hand

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.660
side as well as the left so I've
got to move it over and I have

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:45.720
to solve a system of equations
to find the next u_(n+1).

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.890
So you see that basic
separation of ideas here.

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.000
Forward, faster,
but less stable.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.370
Backward, slower,
generally more stable

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.640
and in fact, in this
case somehow too stable.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.100
It dissipates more energy.

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:10.710
You don't want to
lose all your energy.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.590
So you look for
something better.

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.850
And also you look for
something more accurate.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.010
I want to suggest a
more accurate method,

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.130
the trapezoidal method.

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.250
Which just follows
that basic principle

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:30.310
that if I center
things at halfway

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.300
I'm probably going to pick
up an order of accuracy.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:40.850
So centering it halfway I took
half of backward Euler and half

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.870
of forward Euler.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:47.010
So is this one
explicit or implicit?

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.690
Implicit.

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.850
Implicit. u_(n+1) is
still appearing here,

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:52.470
has to move over there.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:56.420
So if I move it over I
could say here I have,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:07:01.251
let me multiply up by delta
t and bring the u_(n+1) over

00:07:01.251 --> 00:07:01.750
here.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:04.370
So I'd have u_(n+1).

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.950
I'll have minus
delta t over two A.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.240
All that's what's
multiplying u_(n+1).

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.250
Right?

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.500
When I multiply
up, let me do that.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:19.540
Let me make it
easy for your eyes.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.380
I'll multiply up by the delta t.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.980
And then I'm bringing this
part, the implicit part.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:29.210
So that's my left-hand side.

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.720
And what's my
right-hand side? u_n

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.240
is going over as the identity
plus delta t over two A.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.570
All that's what's
multiplying u_n.

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.040
Good.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.200
So this is the matrix that has
to get inverted at every step.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:55.340
Of course, in this model problem
that's not expensive to do.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:57.990
If we have the same
matrix at every step,

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.280
if we have a linear
time-invariant system,

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:08.690
well we can just invert it once
or factor it in into L times U

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:09.760
once.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.400
We don't have to do
it at every step.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.950
So that's, of course, very fast.

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:17.300
But when the problem
becomes non-linear

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:20.480
we're going to start
paying a price for a more

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:23.300
complicated implicit part.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:27.010
What I'm interested
in right now just

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:33.140
to sort of see
these differences,

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:39.610
there's a particular matrix
A that is my model here.

00:08:39.610 --> 00:08:41.570
It's antisymmetric.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:44.710
Notice it's antisymmetric
and that sort of

00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:47.750
goes with conserving energy.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.820
I'm not going to-- In
a first order system,

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.800
that antisymmetric tells me that
the eigenvalues of that matrix

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.710
are pure imaginary.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.110
And so I'm going to get e^(it).

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.200
I'm going to get things
that don't blow up,

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.450
that don't decay.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:14.600
So I want to see, what's
the growth factor?

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:21.080
Suppose you want to understand,
is this method good,

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.830
what's its growth factor?

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:24.900
So that will tell
me about stability.

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.030
It'll tell me about
accuracy, too.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:34.090
So its growth factor,
all I want to do

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:42.800
is put everything on the
right side of the equation.

00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.280
I want to write it in this form.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.930
So that G will be
the growth matrix.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.310
And what is G?

00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:55.270
Well, I just have
to invert that.

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:59.900
That's I minus delta t over
two A. The inverse of that, so

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:08.100
that's the implicit part,
times the explicit part.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:10.180
I'm not doing anything
difficult here.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:16.520
Just seeing how
would you approach

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:20.830
to understand whether
the solution to this

00:10:20.830 --> 00:10:28.120
is growing, decaying,
or staying as we hope,

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.490
with maybe constant energy.

00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:33.974
Because that's what the
true solution is doing.

00:10:33.974 --> 00:10:35.640
The true solution,
you remember, is just

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.920
going around in a circle
in our model problem

00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:45.050
and just oscillating
forever in our model system.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:49.830
What about the growth
or decay or whatever

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:53.030
of that growth factor?

00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.250
Well again, this
is the point where

00:10:55.250 --> 00:10:57.820
I would look for eigenvalues.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.210
If I have a matrix G, and
everybody recognizes that

00:11:02.210 --> 00:11:07.740
after n time steps, what
matrix am I going to have?

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:13.220
What matrix connects
u_n to the original u_0?

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.510
That matrix is?

00:11:15.510 --> 00:11:17.310
G^n.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:21.550
At every step I'm
multiplying by a G.

00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:25.160
So with finite differences,
you have powers.

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.430
That's the rule.

00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:30.640
With differential equations,
you have exponentials.

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:36.220
With finite differences, finite
steps, you have powers of G.

00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:42.220
So I'm interested in G^n and
what tells me about that is

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:44.730
the eigenvalues here.

00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:49.190
If I had to ask for the
eigenvalues of this matrix,

00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:56.010
they would be the eigenvalues
of G. So eig(G), can I say,

00:11:56.010 --> 00:11:59.980
for this case.

00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:04.700
Actually, can I just
say what it would be?

00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.390
What are the
eigenvalues of this guy?

00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:12.330
The eigenvalues of that
factor are one plus delta t

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:17.260
over two times the
eigenvalues of A. That's

00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:19.080
what we're getting from here.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.700
And here, this is the inverse.

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:26.240
So its eigenvalues will
come in the denominator.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:32.230
This'll be one minus delta t
over two times the eigenvalues

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.920
of A. That's pretty good.

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.830
That's pretty good.

00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:41.680
Actually this sort
of shows me a lot.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.000
Well, in the case of
this model example,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.220
the eigenvalues
were i and minus i.

00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:57.170
This is for the special
case A equals [0, 1; -1, 0].

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:04.100
This will be one plus i delta
t over two divided by one

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:09.000
minus i delta t over two.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.560
And the complex conjugate
for the other eigenvalue.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:15.000
It'd be two eigenvalues.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.550
Let me work with the one,
let me take the one that's i

00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:22.510
and then there would be a
similar deal with minus i.

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:32.190
That's our eigenvalue of G.
Where in the complex plane

00:13:32.190 --> 00:13:34.320
is that number?

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.780
If I give you that
complex number.

00:13:37.780 --> 00:13:40.190
We're meeting
complex numbers here.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.140
We're not meeting
complex functions,

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:48.650
just we have to be able to
deal with complex numbers.

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:51.570
Actually, when I look
at those two numbers,

00:13:51.570 --> 00:13:56.440
what do I see right
away about them?

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.140
How are they related?

00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.210
They're conjugates, right?

00:14:02.210 --> 00:14:03.640
Conjugates of each other.

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.650
This one is in
the complex plane,

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:12.360
I would go along one, the real
axis, and up delta t over two.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:15.780
And this one I would go
down delta t over two.

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:21.610
And that symmetry is what
I, the word you used,

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:25.500
the complex conjugate.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.830
Compare that length for the top
with that length for the bottom

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.750
and what do you get?

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:33.940
Same length.

00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:37.000
So I'm concluding
that in this case

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:43.470
the magnitude of these
eigenvalues of G is what?

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:47.570
So magnitude, absolute
value, is just

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:49.270
the absolute value
of that divided

00:14:49.270 --> 00:14:51.670
by the absolute value of that.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.800
It's this distance
divided by this distance.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:59.450
And you told me already
the answer is one.

00:14:59.450 --> 00:15:06.720
The eigenvalues are
right on the unit circle.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.470
In some ways that's wonderful.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.490
The solution if
you compute exactly

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:18.120
will stay on the unit circle.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:23.490
Of course, it will not
be exactly the same

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.710
as the continuous solution.

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:31.461
But the energy won't change.

00:15:31.461 --> 00:15:32.710
We're not going to spiral out.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:34.030
We're not going to spiral in.

00:15:34.030 --> 00:15:37.020
It's this average and
it's more accurate.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.460
So trapezoidal method
is like, the workhorse

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:44.120
for finite element codes.

00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:52.330
Trapezoidal method is a
pretty successful method.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.610
What's the price?

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:58.200
The price is this implicit
stuff that you have to solve.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.990
So I should say
it's the workhorse

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.300
among implicit methods.

00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.660
And it's simple.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:11.630
So just to have a picture,
finite element codes

00:16:11.630 --> 00:16:16.200
usually are not shooting
for great accuracy.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.780
Many finite element
calculations,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:21.610
you're happy with two
or three decimal places.

00:16:21.610 --> 00:16:23.590
So we're not shooting
for great accuracy.

00:16:23.590 --> 00:16:27.670
Second order is very adequate.

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:33.910
What we don't want, of
course, is to be unstable.

00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:39.700
We don't want to
lose all the energy.

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:49.240
So this is really a good method.

00:16:49.240 --> 00:17:02.310
I have to say it's a good
method, but not perfect.

00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:08.320
For linear problems, for my
model problem this is fine.

00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:11.860
For a real problem,
a difficult problem

00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:25.770
in mechanics you might find that
the energy, you might find it

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:28.870
goes a little unstable
and non-linearity

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:33.960
tends to grab onto a little
instability and make it worse.

00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.540
So like Professor Bathe,
if you take his course

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:46.820
on finite elements, this
trapezoidal rule-- Many people

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.090
have reinvented it.

00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:52.940
There's a Newmark
family of methods

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:56.890
and with special parameter, you
get back this one and everybody

00:17:56.890 --> 00:17:59.000
makes that choice practically.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.050
There's just a host of
finite difference methods.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.450
I'm wondering whether you
want me to tell you one more.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:09.130
Do you want one more
finite difference method?

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:13.540
Just to like, see what.

00:18:13.540 --> 00:18:15.210
You said yes, right?

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:16.130
One more method.

00:18:16.130 --> 00:18:21.120
One more and then, this
is a subject on its own.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.500
But just to see what
else could you do.

00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.180
What else might you do?

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:27.020
And let me say why you would.

00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:30.990
And Professor
Bathe had to do it.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:37.250
In some problems he found
that with non-linear problems,

00:18:37.250 --> 00:18:42.980
he found that this method, which
for a perfect linear problem

00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:48.420
stays exactly one, that's great,
but you're playing with fire.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:54.520
To be right on the unit circle,
if non-linearity pushes you off

00:18:54.520 --> 00:19:00.850
then you wish you had not tried
tried for that perfection.

00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:10.040
So let me describe a
backward difference.

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:18.090
Let me write down,
I'll call this BDF2.

00:19:18.090 --> 00:19:22.650
All these formulas
have names and numbers.

00:19:22.650 --> 00:19:26.230
So this would be Backward
Difference Formula second order

00:19:26.230 --> 00:19:27.810
accurate.

00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:30.360
You'll see, it goes
two steps back.

00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:38.240
So here it is.
u_(n+1)-u_n over delta t.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.520
And then there's
another term which

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.330
gets the second order accuracy.

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:54.220
It happens to be u_(n+1) -
2u_n + u_(n-1) over delta t.

00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:56.310
And then that really is delta t.

00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:58.260
Equals Au_(n+1).

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.700
It's good practice.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:11.010
That formula came
from somewhere.

00:20:11.010 --> 00:20:12.110
What if we look at it.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.950
What do we see?

00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.990
What's the picture for
a formula like that?

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:25.180
Is it implicit or explicit
first, our first question.

00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:25.950
Implicit.

00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.870
Because it's using, this
right-hand side involves this.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.190
And if it was a
non-linear equation,

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:35.560
whatever that right-hand
side is, not linear,

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.330
would be evaluated
at the new step

00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:43.200
and therefore would have
to go back over here.

00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:45.640
It is second order
accurate and I won't go

00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:51.080
through the checking on that.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.970
And is it stable?

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:56.120
That's another question.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:59.620
We have to find
eigenvalues here.

00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:07.860
Let me not go through
all details there.

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.920
It is stable.

00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.460
And it's slightly dissipative.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.110
It's not as dissipative
as backward Euler.

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:19.130
There you're losing energy fast.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:24.750
Here the eigenvalues,
the thing would

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:33.390
stay much closer to the unit
circle than backward Euler.

00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:41.350
I'll just put up
there so that you see.

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:45.590
What are other features
that you see right away

00:21:45.590 --> 00:21:47.220
from this method?

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:52.050
The fact that it involves
not only u_(n+1) and u_n,

00:21:52.050 --> 00:21:54.050
but also u_(n-1).

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.320
What does that mean?

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.870
How do I get started
with that method?

00:21:57.870 --> 00:21:59.110
Right?

00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:02.910
This calls to find the new u.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:07.630
I need the previous one
and the one before that.

00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:09.270
No problem, I have them.

00:22:09.270 --> 00:22:11.160
Except at the start I don't.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:14.520
So it'll need a sort
of special start

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.840
to be able to figure
out what should u_n be.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.250
It'll need a separate
formula to decide.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:26.410
And it could use one step of
backward Euler to find u_1.

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:33.510
And then take off, now
finding u_2 from u_1 and u_0.

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:34.750
And then onward.

00:22:34.750 --> 00:22:36.510
So that's quite fast.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:40.100
More stable, good method.

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:46.660
And you maybe can see that
I could get more formulas

00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:49.730
by going back further in time.

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:54.720
And by doing that I can
get the accuracy higher.

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.120
So that's good to see
that particular BDF2.

00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.430
So that's a backward
difference formula.

00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:09.300
Oh, just to mention
what's developed.

00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:14.720
So this is stable.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:17.140
It actually loses
a little energy.

00:23:17.140 --> 00:23:21.360
So in fact now both
Professor Bathe and I

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:28.070
have studied the possibility
of taking a trapezoidal step,

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.900
which was a little dangerous
in the non-linear case

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.890
because you were
playing with fire,

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.630
you were right on the circle.

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:39.100
And then put in a
backward difference step

00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:43.210
to recover a little stability.

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:47.170
And then trapezoidal
backward difference.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:48.710
So split step.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:52.520
Split the step into a
trapezoidal part and a backward

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.340
difference part.

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:58.350
That's actually discussed
later in Chapter 2.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:01.200
Section 2.6 and I might
come back to that.

00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:04.150
I just wanted to say
that much this morning.

00:24:04.150 --> 00:24:10.650
Having got as far as
forward and backward Euler.

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:14.570
I didn't want to leave you
without a better method which

00:24:14.570 --> 00:24:18.660
is the trapezoidal method.

00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:23.600
I could take any question.

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:26.850
I would like to devote
the second half,

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.840
if you're okay to
just change gear,

00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:34.460
to beginning on least squares.

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:40.660
So this was our
kind of excitement

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.410
to have time dependence
for a little while.

00:24:43.410 --> 00:24:48.280
But now I'm going back
to steady-state problems.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.870
So they're not moving.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:51.970
I'm looking at equilibrium.

00:24:51.970 --> 00:24:57.630
And what I'm going to do
now in the next lectures

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:06.470
is more to see this framework
that we identified once

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:09.680
for the masses and springs,
to see it again and again.

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.600
Because it's the basic
framework of applied math.

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:15.330
So now I'm ready
for least squares.

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:17.300
Least squares.

00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:22.700
What's the problem?

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.120
Well the problem is I'm given
a system of equations Au=f.

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:42.410
These f's are observations.

00:25:42.410 --> 00:25:45.850
The u is the unknown vector.

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:47.520
You say what's different here?

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.480
It's just a linear system.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.190
What's different is
too many equations.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:26:01.220
This is an m by n matrix
with m bigger than n.

00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:05.550
Maybe much bigger than n.

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:07.200
So what do we do?

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:18.920
We've got too many equations and
no solution, no exact solution.

00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.980
I would say probably that
what we're coming to,

00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.390
what we're starting on
today is the most important,

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:29.500
the application of linear
algebra that I see the most.

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.830
So it interests everybody.

00:26:30.830 --> 00:26:36.650
It interests engineers,
scientists, statisticians,

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:43.680
everybody has to deal with this
problem of too many equations.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.170
And those equations
come from measurements

00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.290
so you don't want
to throw them away.

00:26:48.290 --> 00:26:50.360
I don't want to just throw away.

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.480
I want to somehow get
the best solution.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.980
I'm looking for the
u that comes closest

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.920
when I can't find an exact u.

00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:02.290
So that's the idea.

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:05.120
There's no exact
solution and the problem

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:12.080
is what is the best u.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.920
And I'm going to
call that u hat.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:18.960
My favorite choice
of u will be u hat.

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:22.460
So I'm going to get
an equation for u hat.

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:25.110
That is my goal.

00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:31.810
And what I'm starting here
just goes all the way to,

00:27:31.810 --> 00:27:33.940
there will be weighted
least squares,

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:36.380
there will be Kalman filters.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.420
It's a giant world
here of estimating

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.940
the best solution when there's
noise in the right-hand side.

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:46.520
And what's the model problem?

00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:48.360
Always good to have
a model problem.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.600
Let me draw a model problem.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:28:00.550
Model problem is fit
by a straight line.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.040
So say C+Dt.

00:28:07.650 --> 00:28:09.750
Shall I use that as the--?

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.130
C+Dx.

00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:13.030
It's got two unknowns.

00:28:13.030 --> 00:28:15.310
So n is two.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:21.100
But m is big.

00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.330
What do I have?

00:28:22.330 --> 00:28:23.520
Let me draw the picture.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:26.030
You've seen this often.

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.870
This is the t-direction,
this is the f.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:31.140
These are the measurements.

00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:39.170
So I measure at
time t=0, let's say.

00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:45.300
I measure my position.

00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:47.140
That would be f_1.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.130
At time t=1 I've
moved somewhere,

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:52.290
I've measured where I am.

00:28:52.290 --> 00:28:54.740
I'm tracking a
satellite, let's say.

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.700
So I'm tracking this satellite.

00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.410
Well the times don't have
to be equally spaced.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:03.570
I'll take the next
time to be three.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:10.590
Let's say the engine
is off, this satellite.

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:13.630
If the measurements
were perfect--

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:16.520
Does that look too
perfect to you?

00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.870
It's almost on a
straight line, isn't it?

00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:23.270
Of course my point is that
measurements, well I mean,

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:25.560
of course in
reality measurements

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:27.190
would be close to
a straight line.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:31.380
I'm going to have to draw, in
order for you to see anything,

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:35.990
I'm going to have
to draw a really--

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.520
Suppose f_1 is one.

00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:46.410
Suppose it starts at position
one and suppose f_2 is two

00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:53.200
and this guy will be-- Where
do you want me to take it?

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:58.160
Let's see, if it was
linear, what would be the--?

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.240
It would be four, right?

00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:03.640
So can I take a
different number?

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.710
Three.

00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:05.600
Is three okay?

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:09.180
Because five I
haven't got space for.

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.810
And you don't want to see
pi or some dumb thing or e.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:20.960
So let me take three.

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.370
I want to fit that
data which is,

00:30:23.370 --> 00:30:25.520
we're saying, close
to a straight line,

00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:28.360
I want to fit it by
the best straight line.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:31.350
So the best straight
line would go probably,

00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.010
I don't know what
your eyes suggest

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.120
for the best straight
line through three points.

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:40.290
Do you see I've got three
equations, two unknowns?

00:30:40.290 --> 00:30:41.730
That's the first point to see.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:46.630
Somehow I'm trying to fit
three things with only two

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:50.440
degrees of freedom and I'm
not going to succeed, usually.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:54.030
But I'm going to do my best
and probably the best line

00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:59.420
goes sort of, it won't exactly
go through any of them.

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:03.970
So I'm doing the best least
squares approximation.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:05.210
And what does that mean?

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:08.160
Well, what would the
three equations be?

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.990
What does my linear
equations, my unsolvable ones,

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.460
say that at time zero?

00:31:15.460 --> 00:31:19.730
So at time zero, at time
one and at time three,

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:24.200
at each of those times I have
an equation C+Dt should agree

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:31.070
with-- So that C plus D
times zero should match f_1.

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:40.140
At t=1 my line will be
C+D*1, it should equal f_2.

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:46.570
And at t=3, the height
of the line will be C+3D,

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:50.950
and I would like it to go
through that height f_3.

00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:58.780
But I'm not going to
be able-- If there

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:02.110
was noise in the measurements
that system, that's

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:06.140
my unsolvable system.

00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:08.660
What's the matrix?

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.660
I want to write three
equations and you're

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:19.700
getting good at seeing
three equations like so.

00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:24.810
So I've a 3 by 2 matrix.

00:32:24.810 --> 00:32:28.710
And my unknown u is [C, D].

00:32:28.710 --> 00:32:30.140
Those are my unknowns.

00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.190
And my right-hand sides
are these heights, well,

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:40.720
I decided on particular
numbers, one, two and three.

00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:42.420
One, two, three.

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:44.480
And what's the matrix?

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.160
What's the matrix A that
you read off when you

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.040
see that system of equations?

00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.750
The first column
of the matrix is?

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.720
All ones because that's
multiplying the C's.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.980
And the second column of
the matrix is the times.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:02.380
Zero, one, three, is that right?

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:08.070
That multiply the D. So
this is the same as that.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:12.840
So here I'm in my set-up.

00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:24.510
I'll erase m equal big because
m was only three, not that big.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:30.060
What's the best answer?

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:32.010
What's the best u hat?

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:38.770
The best u hat will
now be C hat and D hat.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:45.730
The best I can do.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:50.920
I need some idea of
what does best mean.

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:55.520
And there is not a
single possible meaning.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.670
There are many possible ways
I could say the best line.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:05.830
One way would be
to make the, well,

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.110
what could a best line be?

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:11.510
I'm going to have three
errors here, right?

00:34:11.510 --> 00:34:14.190
That did not go right
through the point.

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:15.970
This did not go right
through the point.

00:34:15.970 --> 00:34:17.470
They came pretty close.

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:23.280
I've got three small
errors. e_1, e_2, e_3.

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:26.510
Those are the errors
in my equations.

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:31.690
So I will get equality when
I add in the e_1, e_2, e_3,

00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:39.680
the little bits that will
bring it onto the line.

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.820
One idea.

00:34:41.820 --> 00:34:46.880
Make the largest error
as small as I can.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:54.730
Minimize the maximum of the e's
Try to balance them so no e,

00:34:54.730 --> 00:34:58.790
no error is bigger
than the others.

00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:00.630
Look for that balance.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:04.770
That's a reasonable idea.

00:35:04.770 --> 00:35:07.360
But it's not the
least squares idea.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:11.290
So what's the
least squares idea?

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.680
The least squares
idea makes the sum

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.640
of the squares of the
errors as small as possible.

00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:29.075
So the least squares idea
will be to minimize the sum

00:35:29.075 --> 00:35:33.550
of the squares of the
errors. e_1 squared plus...

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:35.940
e_m squared.

00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:38.610
It would be just e_1
squared plus e_2 squared

00:35:38.610 --> 00:35:42.440
plus e_3 squared.

00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:44.710
What is this?

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:48.240
Let me began to write
this in matrix--

00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.240
I want to bring in
the matrix here.

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:56.210
This is the error.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:36:00.670
The error is the difference
between the measurements

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.650
and Au.

00:36:02.650 --> 00:36:06.820
So that's what I'm
trying to make small.

00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:09.680
I'd love to make it
zero but I can't.

00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.080
I've got more equations
than unknowns.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.410
There's no two unknowns that
will make all three errors

00:36:15.410 --> 00:36:16.680
zero.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.950
So I want to make
the errors small.

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:23.620
And this is the
length of e squared.

00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:30.110
The length in this
sum of squares method.

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:37.900
It's a pretty good
measure of the error.

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.800
Gauss was the first to
apply least squares.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:45.740
What I'm going to
do today is Gauss.

00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:48.620
Who was, by the way, the
greatest mathematician

00:36:48.620 --> 00:36:52.030
of all time.

00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:54.910
And here, he was doing
astronomy actually.

00:36:54.910 --> 00:37:03.750
And writing in Latin.

00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:08.750
The message got out somehow.

00:37:08.750 --> 00:37:12.420
So his idea was sum of squares.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:18.510
So this e is the distance
between f and Au.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:22.340
I have to begin to write.

00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.960
I have to write some things.

00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:28.740
I can write some things out
in detail, but then I also,

00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:30.900
at the same time,
have to carry along

00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:34.410
the way I would look
at it for any matrix A

00:37:34.410 --> 00:37:36.210
and any right-hand side f.

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:39.370
So do you see that
this is the error?

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:44.040
The meaning of this double
bars squared is exactly that.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.670
That it's the sum of the
squares of the components.

00:37:46.670 --> 00:37:54.190
So that's where the word
least squares come in.

00:37:54.190 --> 00:38:02.920
Can I just say what's
better about least squares

00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.660
and what's maybe a drawback.

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.510
So actually this
next sentence is

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:12.150
pretty important in practice.

00:38:12.150 --> 00:38:14.340
What's better about
least squares, what's

00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:19.190
really nice about
least squares is well,

00:38:19.190 --> 00:38:23.960
for one thing, the equations
we get for the best [C, D]

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:29.620
will be linear, will
be linear equations.

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.810
You may say, not
surprising, I started out

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:35.955
with a linear
system and I'm going

00:38:35.955 --> 00:38:39.040
to end up with a linear system.

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:45.030
Actually I prefer to use--
Well, might be too late.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.090
Next lecture I'm going
to put b in there

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:49.340
for the right-hand side.

00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:54.000
But I'll leave it
with that for now.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.420
So good point is we'll
get linear equations.

00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:04.810
The not so good point
in some applications

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:11.380
is when I look at the
squares of errors,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:18.290
well big errors, outliers,
really bad measurements

00:39:18.290 --> 00:39:20.650
have a big influence
on the answer

00:39:20.650 --> 00:39:22.590
because of getting squared.

00:39:22.590 --> 00:39:30.620
So if I have ten readings that
are very accurate but then

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:35.660
in an eleventh reading that
is way off and I don't know it

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:38.890
and if I don't realize
that that's way off, then

00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:43.770
that eleventh error
will-- It's like having

00:39:43.770 --> 00:39:45.550
a whole lot of points
close to a line

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:48.040
and then another point way off.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:55.250
That will have a significant
effect on the best line.

00:39:55.250 --> 00:40:02.240
So you might say
too great an effect.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:05.570
Depends on the application.

00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:10.900
I just had to say before
starting on least squares,

00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:16.790
as always, there are
advantages and disadvantages

00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:18.880
but the advantages
are very, very great.

00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:25.780
So it's an important
idea here, least squares.

00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:31.650
I'm ready now to ask for
the equation for u hat.

00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:38.700
So the equation for u hat is
the u that minimizes here.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:45.880
So we have touched on
minimizing quadratics.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:54.060
This is squares.

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:59.670
I could expand that out as
f minus A u transpose times

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:06.700
f minus Au just to see
another way to write it.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:11.050
The length squared of a vector
is always the transpose--

00:41:11.050 --> 00:41:14.030
Its inner product with itself.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:19.090
And I could split this out
into all these different terms.

00:41:19.090 --> 00:41:22.040
I would have then, some
quadratic expression

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.480
to minimize.

00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:28.940
In other words, let
me jump to the answer.

00:41:28.940 --> 00:41:33.540
Let me jump to the
equation for the best u.

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:38.570
And then come back to see why.

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:41.990
Because you must see
what that equation is.

00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:44.720
It's the fundamental
equation of, this

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.280
might be called linear
regression, fitting data.

00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:51.570
You're just constantly doing it.

00:41:51.570 --> 00:41:56.280
So what is the equation
for the best u hat?

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.480
Can I put it here?

00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:01.400
This'll be equation
that we get to.

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.960
It'll be A transpose
A. You're not

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:07.040
surprised to see A
transpose A up here.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.920
First of all because
this is 18.085

00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:14.050
and also because
this A is rectangular

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:16.760
and when you have
rectangular matrices,

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:19.480
sooner or later A
transpose A comes up.

00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:21.670
So that's the matrix.

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:26.860
And then the right-hand
side is A transpose f.

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.490
So that's the key equation
for least squares.

00:42:30.490 --> 00:42:33.870
That's the central
equation of least squares.

00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:37.480
And let's just see
what it looks like.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.350
You could say the
way I arrived at it,

00:42:40.350 --> 00:42:43.620
I mean the short way is
this is an equation that I

00:42:43.620 --> 00:42:45.810
can't satisfy.

00:42:45.810 --> 00:42:55.570
I multiply both
sides by A transpose

00:42:55.570 --> 00:43:00.050
and now this is the
equation for u hat.

00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:05.150
And what that did was kind of
average out the m equations.

00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.920
Because how many
equations do I now have?

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:09.700
A as m by n.

00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:13.420
What's the shape
of A transpose A?

00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:15.650
Everybody's on top
of that, right?

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:21.350
The shape of A transpose
A is square, n by n.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:28.960
Because A transpose is n
by m. n by m times m by n

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.610
leaves us an n by n.

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:34.060
So we've averaged
the m equations

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:38.900
that were too many
to get n equations.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:47.410
And of course this is what it
should be, n by m, m by one.

00:43:47.410 --> 00:43:48.520
So it's n by one.

00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:51.500
It's a good right-hand side.

00:43:51.500 --> 00:44:02.030
That's the equation
of least squares.

00:44:02.030 --> 00:44:07.300
That's the equation I want to
explain, understand and solve.

00:44:07.300 --> 00:44:10.520
Actually why don't we solve
it for this particular problem

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:17.210
just to see the whole
thing for this example.

00:44:17.210 --> 00:44:22.060
Just to do it.

00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:25.980
So there is A. Here is u.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:32.900
And here is f. what
shall I call these?

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:36.310
They're mostly called
the normal equations.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:42.110
That's one possible word for the
key equation of least squares,

00:44:42.110 --> 00:44:44.610
the normal equations.

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:47.990
Can you tell me these
matrices A transpose A?

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.320
And u hat I know.

00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:53.460
That'll be the best
C and the best D.

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:59.390
And over here can you
compute A transpose f?

00:44:59.390 --> 00:45:01.730
If I write A transpose
above it, will that

00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:05.500
help you do these
multiplications?

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.580
Let me just do.

00:45:06.580 --> 00:45:12.650
So there was the matrix A. Let
me write A transpose above it.

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:22.900
So it has a row of ones
and then a row of times.

00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.380
So what shape is the matrix?

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:30.470
The A transpose A matrix.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:33.480
It's going to be that A
transpose times that A.

00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:37.550
The size will be
two by two, right?

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.890
Two by three times
three by two, it's

00:45:39.890 --> 00:45:43.530
averaging out to get
me a two by two matrix.

00:45:43.530 --> 00:45:46.130
What's the first entry of this?

00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:50.890
Can you do A transpose times
A just so we see this matrix.

00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:52.220
Three.

00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:54.790
And off the diagonal?

00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:55.630
Four.

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:56.900
And here?

00:45:56.900 --> 00:45:58.490
And you knew it
would be symmetric.

00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:59.790
And here?

00:45:59.790 --> 00:46:03.660
Ten.

00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:06.700
And tell me A transpose
f while we're at it.

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:08.470
So that's just a vector.

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:11.340
If you multiply that by
the right-hand sides,

00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:12.650
looks like a six.

00:46:12.650 --> 00:46:18.640
Is that right?

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.210
11, maybe.

00:46:21.210 --> 00:46:24.020
Is that right?

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:29.730
Two, nine making 11, yeah.

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.110
So those are the numbers.

00:46:31.110 --> 00:46:35.710
I can't write those numbers,
write A transpose A,

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.390
without asking you to tell
me one more time what kind

00:46:39.390 --> 00:46:42.640
of a matrix have I got here?

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.770
It's symmetric positive
definite, right?

00:46:44.770 --> 00:46:47.840
We know that's going to be.

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:50.430
And we see it.

00:46:50.430 --> 00:46:54.230
Our test for positive definite
might be the determinant,

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:57.030
that one by one
determinant is three,

00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:04.870
that two by two determinant
is 30 minus 16, 14, positive.

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:06.710
We got a good problem here.

00:47:06.710 --> 00:47:09.750
And I could solve
for C hat and D hat.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:13.730
I see the numbers are not
coming out fantastically

00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:18.530
but they would produce a line
that would, I'm pretty sure,

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:25.310
it would be, this
looks optimal to me.

00:47:25.310 --> 00:47:29.570
If I rotated any, I'm
going to make things worse.

00:47:29.570 --> 00:47:31.480
I think it would look like that.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.590
So that's the system
that you end up with.

00:47:35.590 --> 00:47:37.790
But why?

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:41.740
You really have to
understand, where

00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.710
did this equation come from.

00:47:44.710 --> 00:47:50.010
Where did it come from?

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:56.380
It's worth understanding,
this least squares stuff.

00:47:56.380 --> 00:48:01.690
So I'm going to try to draw
a picture that makes it clear

00:48:01.690 --> 00:48:08.190
where that equation comes from.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:11.560
So what am I doing here?

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:12.060
Au=f.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:18.130
Start there.

00:48:18.130 --> 00:48:21.130
And the particular
A was, I'll even

00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:25.230
copy the A. It was
1, 1, 1; 0, 1, 3,

00:48:25.230 --> 00:48:30.400
multiplied u to give
me f as [0,  1, 3].

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.290
But of course, I
couldn't solve it

00:48:32.290 --> 00:48:35.550
because I don't have
enough unknowns.

00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:39.740
What's the picture?

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:46.540
Everybody likes to see
what's happening by a picture

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:49.170
as well as by algebra.

00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:55.750
So the picture here is
I'm in three dimensions

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.820
and I have a vector [0, 1, 3].

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:01.480
So 0 in that direction,
one in that, three up.

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:07.640
So somewhere there is my f.

00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:15.760
Now I'll put in C, D here.

00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:19.570
What is the equation
asking me to do?

00:49:19.570 --> 00:49:22.630
Which actually, I won't be able
to do because I can't solve it.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:35.610
But the equation, how do we see
a system of linear equations?

00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:38.060
If I have a system
of linear equations

00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:41.090
I'm looking for
numbers C and D so

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:52.230
that C times column one plus D
times column two gives me that.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:55.180
That's how I think of
a system of equations.

00:49:55.180 --> 00:50:00.990
A combination of the columns.

00:50:00.990 --> 00:50:04.400
Tell me, what vectors do I
get if I take combinations

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.160
of the columns.

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.160
Well, if I took the
combination C=1,

00:50:07.160 --> 00:50:09.860
D=0 I would just get
the first column.

00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:14.880
So that's a candidate. [1, 1,
 1], I don't know where that is.

00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:20.380
Wherever [1, 1, 1] might be.

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:23.490
I'm not too sure where
to draw [1, 1, 1].

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:27.840
I want to go one there,
one there and one there.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:31.350
Damn.

00:50:31.350 --> 00:50:35.920
Let's define that to be the
vector [1, 1, 1] right there.

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.420
Wait.

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.000
You let me put that up
there and I didn't mean to,

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:48.770
right? f should be zero, what,
sorry? f was [1, 2, 3], yeah.

00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:49.920
Damn!

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:52.010
Don't let me make mistakes.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:57.780
These mistakes are permanent
if you let them slide by.

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:04.660
That's it, same point.

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.660
I didn't have the point
right in the first place

00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:08.620
so now it's just perfect.

00:51:08.620 --> 00:51:15.920
There it is.

00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.250
Before of course,
if I had [0,  1, 3],

00:51:18.250 --> 00:51:21.810
I could've solved the equation.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:26.060
But with [1, 2, 3] I can't.

00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:27.250
Here's the situation.

00:51:27.250 --> 00:51:31.270
This vector is not a
combination of those two.

00:51:31.270 --> 00:51:36.320
Because the combinations of two
vectors, what's the picture?

00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:40.290
If I try to draw, if I look
at all combinations of two

00:51:40.290 --> 00:51:44.940
vectors, [1, 1, 1] which
is that vector, [0, 1, 3]

00:51:44.940 --> 00:51:49.880
which is maybe this
vector, let's just say.

00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:53.010
If I take the combinations
of these two column vectors,

00:51:53.010 --> 00:51:55.490
what do I get?

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:57.760
Now this is for
everybody to know.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.640
If I take the combinations
of two vectors

00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:04.170
here in three-dimensional
space I get a plane.

00:52:04.170 --> 00:52:08.990
I get the plane that
contains those vectors.

00:52:08.990 --> 00:52:14.450
So this I could call the column
plane or the column space.

00:52:14.450 --> 00:52:21.650
This is all combinations
of the columns.

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:27.890
That's the same thing as
saying this is all the f's

00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:38.650
that have exact solutions.

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:41.290
So let's just see this picture.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:45.120
This particular right-hand side
is not in the plane, right?

00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:46.630
That's my problem.

00:52:46.630 --> 00:52:51.100
This particular vector f
points out of the plane.

00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:53.740
But if I change
it a little, like

00:52:53.740 --> 00:52:56.350
if I change it to [1, 2, 4].

00:52:56.350 --> 00:52:57.790
Do you see that that would--?

00:52:57.790 --> 00:53:01.110
What's different now that
I've changed it to [1, 2, 3]

00:53:01.110 --> 00:53:05.220
for a moment?

00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:07.820
What's different
about [1, 2,  4]?

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:11.890
Where is [1, 2, 4]
in my picture?

00:53:11.890 --> 00:53:14.850
Do you see what's
great about [1, 2, 4]?

00:53:14.850 --> 00:53:16.380
It is a combination.

00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:20.520
Right? [1, 2, 4] is a
combination, with C=1, D=1.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:24.560
It would satisfy the equation.

00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:28.750
So where is [1, 2, 4]
in my picture?

00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:31.410
It's in the plane.

00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:38.770
The plane are the heights that
do lie on a straight line.

00:53:38.770 --> 00:53:42.660
So the plane are all the
ones that I can get exactly.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:49.440
But this vector, these
observations, [1, 2, 3],

00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.660
I couldn't get exactly.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:54.440
So let me-- In 30
seconds or less,

00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:57.370
let me tell you the
best thing to do.

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:59.620
Or let you tell me
the best thing to do.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.660
I have a right-hand side
that's not in the plane.

00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:05.160
I can get my straight
lines correspond

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:07.610
to vectors, right-hand
sides that are in the plane.

00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:10.990
So what do I do?

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:12.060
I project.

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:15.830
I take the nearest
point that is the plane

00:54:15.830 --> 00:54:18.830
as my right-hand side.

00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.040
I project down.

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:23.015
And it's that
projection that's going

00:54:23.015 --> 00:54:26.340
to lead us to the
equation that I'm

00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:32.250
shooting for, A transpose A
u hat equals A transpose f.

00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:38.760
This comes from projecting
f down into the plane

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:43.320
where straight lines
do work exactly.

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:47.570
So there's an error here
that I can't deal with.

00:54:47.570 --> 00:54:50.170
And there's a part here,
the projection part,

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:52.240
that I can deal with.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:56.300
This is important and
it's fun and we'll

00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.480
come back to it Monday.

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.260
Thanks for patience.

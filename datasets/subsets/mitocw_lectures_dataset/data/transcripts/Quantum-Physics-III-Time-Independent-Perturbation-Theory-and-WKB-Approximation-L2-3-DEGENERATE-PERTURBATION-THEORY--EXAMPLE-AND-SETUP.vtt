00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.170
PROFESSOR: OK, degenerate
perturbation theory.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.420
OK, we've done nicely
our non-degenerate case.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:19.450
So we'll get degenerate done
in a very clear way, I think.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.170
One more blackboard.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.950
So the first thing I want
to say about degenerate

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.060
perturbation theories, when
it fails and why it fails

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.350
and what goes wrong.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.170
So degenerate
perturbation theory.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.580
Trivial example to begin
with, why not, h of lambda,

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.880
again, is equal to h0
plus lambda delta h.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:22.300
And for h0, we'll take original
Hamiltonian with energies 1

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.755
and 1, and for
delta h, I'll take

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:34.340
an off-diagonal
Hamiltonian, a Pauli matrix,

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.305
and that's our delta h.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.270
And then we say OK, blindly,
not worry about this degeneracy,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.810
and use the formulas that we
have for non-degenerate states.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.410
And we would say well,
for the first state

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.330
and the second state
what do we have?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:13.110
E, I'll call them 1
and 2, not 0 and 1.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.310
So let's call them
1 of lambda will

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.080
be equal to the first value, 1,
plus, if the formula is right,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.540
delta h times lambda, 1, 1.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.250
The matrix element of the
perturbation in the 1, 1 state.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.020
Similarly, E2, the
other eigenvalue,

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:49.070
should be 1, there's the
second eigenvalue, plus lambda,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.260
delta h 2, 2.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.080
That's what the
formula would say.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.430
But this is
completely incorrect.

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.940
Why?

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:12.150
Because delta h 1, 1 is the 1, 1
element of delta h, and it's 0.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.720
And the 2, 2 element
of delta h is also 0,

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.770
and therefore this says 1 and
1, that the eigenvalues haven't

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.260
changed.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.650
On the other hand, we know that
the matrix, the total matrix,

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.660
which is 1 lambda, lambda
1 has eigenvectors,

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.670
1 over square root of 2, 1, 1,
and 1 over square root of 2,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.600
1 minus 1, with eigenvalues--

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.730
this is our eigenvectors
and eigenvalues--

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.955
1 plus lambda and
1 minus lambda.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.660
So the eigenvalues of the
matrix are 1 plus lambda

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.050
and 1 minus lambda.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.880
And this formula, to first order
in lambda, gave us nothing.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.430
It failed badly.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.184
It's a disaster.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.920
So you can say,
well, what happened?

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.120
And maybe a clue is on the
fact of the eigenvectors.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.450
These are the eigenvectors
of the total matrix.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:47.140
These are in fact,
also the eigenvectors

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:48.180
of the perturbation.

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:56.440
On the other hand,
when we said OK, this

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.880
is the first state,
the first eigenvector,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.840
we thought of it as 1,
0 on the Hamiltonian,

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.840
on that eigenvector
gave you the energy 1.

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:13.660
The second energy corresponds
to the eigenvector 0, 1.

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.240
That's what we usually
use for our matrices.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.450
So here is the strange thing
that seems to have happened.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.510
For the original
Hamiltonian, [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.690
we had this eigenvector
and this eigenvector,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:32.170
and then suddenly you
turn on the perturbation

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:36.370
and lambda can be 10
to the minus 1,000,

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:42.280
and already the eigenvectors
jump and become this one.

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.860
They go from this
one to that one.

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.870
You just add a perturbation
that you even cannot measure,

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.859
and the eigenvectors change.

00:05:51.859 --> 00:05:52.400
That's crazy.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:02.570
The explanation is this
thing that we usually,

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:08.180
sometimes forget to say in a
mathematically precise way.

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:15.050
These are not the eigenvectors
of the original matrix.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.050
Since the original
matrix is degenerate,

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:22.220
this is one possible
choice of eigenvectors.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.610
Any linear combination of
them is an eigenvector.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.720
So this space of
eigenvectors of this matrix

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.100
is the span of these things.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.590
So there was no reason
to say, oh, these

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:41.510
were the eigenvectors before,
and now they've changed.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.680
They're this.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.670
No.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.280
Before, you don't know
what are the eigenvectors.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.330
They're ambiguous.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:52.070
There's no way to
decide who they are.

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.590
This, this, or any
linear combination.

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:57.380
Remember, when you have
a degenerate eigenstate,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.980
any superposition of them
is a degenerate eigenstate.

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:05.896
So the explanation is
that, in some sense,

00:07:05.896 --> 00:07:11.570
these eigenvectors of
the perturbed Hamiltonian

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:15.740
is one of the possible choices
of a basis of eigenvectors

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.730
for the original space,
and what the perturbation

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:23.000
does is break the degeneracy.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.410
All those equivalent
eigenvectors suddenly

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.110
are not all equivalent.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:30.680
There are some preferred ones.

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.690
So the fact is that the
formulas are not working right,

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.530
and we have to do this again.

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:45.210
So here is what
we're going to do.

00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:52.100
We're going to set this up
for a systematic analysis

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:55.280
to get this right.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.230
So systematic analysis.

00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:11.310
So again, we say h0 is known
and it will have an E of, say,

00:08:11.310 --> 00:08:23.220
1, 0, an E 2, 0, like that,
until you encounter an E n, 0

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:28.680
that happens to be equal to
the next one, E, n plus 1, 0,

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:30.750
and happens to be
equal to the next one,

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.650
all the way to an
E n plus capital

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:40.950
N minus 1, 0, which
is then smaller

00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:49.320
than the next one, which is
E n plus N and then again.

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:54.090
So I'm saying in
funny ways the fact

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:59.550
that, yes, you had some
states and suddenly you

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:09.700
hit a collection of N energy
eigenvalues that are identical.

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.500
They're all equal to En0.

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:23.990
All n states have energy en0.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.940
So it is as if you
have this matrix h0

00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.690
and there are all
kinds of numbers.

00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:35.240
And then there's a whole block
where all the entries of size

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.900
n by n where all the
entries are the same.

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:48.540
So n, n plus 1, n plus 2, up
to N minus 1 is n entries,

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.685
and they all have
the same energy.

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.140
And the corresponding
eigenstates

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.260
are going to be called n--

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:04.420
we're going to use the
label n for all of them,

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:07.800
even though the energies
are all the same.

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.330
So there's just an E n energy.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:13.440
So we have N state,
so there will

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:24.460
be an n1, an n2, up to an nN.

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:39.210
All those states are going
to form an orthonormal basis

00:10:39.210 --> 00:10:43.080
for a space that we're
going to call vn.

00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:52.110
So the space spanned by this
state, we're going to go vn,

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.620
with the n reminding you
it has to do with the n

00:10:55.620 --> 00:11:04.890
states, states with energy
described by the label n.

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:08.580
So this is the
degenerate subspace.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:14.760
This is the space of all those
states that have energy En0.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.905
So I'll state that here.

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:25.380
So it's quite important to
get our notation right here.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.200
Otherwise we don't
understand what's going on.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:42.290
So h0, n0k, they all
have energy En0, n0k.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:54.940
And this is for k equals
1 up to N. Now OK,

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.159
this is your
degenerate subspace.

00:11:58.159 --> 00:11:59.200
These are all the states.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:03.270
And we now want to know
what happens to this space,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:07.780
to all these states,
when the energy turns on.

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:11.890
This is not just a
theoretical construct.

00:12:11.890 --> 00:12:16.120
When you start asking what
happens to the first excited

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.640
states in the hydrogen
atom, you already

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.710
have four states there, l
equals 1, l equals 0 states,

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:26.880
n equals 2.

00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.510
And you have degenerate
states and immediately you're

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:34.360
stuck in this situation.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:46.240
So I will also use the
notation that the total space,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:56.920
a curly h, is the sum
of vn plus a v hat.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.420
This is called the direct sum.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.380
At this point it just
doesn't matter too much.

00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:08.940
These are linearly independent
subspaces, vn and v hat,

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:14.320
and basically you think as v
hat as all the other states.

00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.470
Yes, there were these
degenerate subspace

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:23.110
and all the other
states of our v hat.

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:32.140
So v hat is the span
of all other states.

00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:37.790
And we'll call them
p0, or what letter?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:44.620
Yeah, p0, with p
equals some numbers.

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:47.050
So this is a good notation.

00:13:47.050 --> 00:13:49.510
It allows you to distinguish.

00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:54.040
The degenerate
states use 2 labels.

00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.560
Maybe you only needed
1 label, but you

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:58.660
will get confused
with the notation

00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.350
if you just use 1 label.

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:03.130
So if that's the case,
degenerate state,

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.560
but by putting
the n here you now

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.870
know that you're talking
about degenerate states.

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:09.520
When you have a
single label you're

00:14:09.520 --> 00:14:14.110
talking about the other
states in the space.

00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:19.390
So it's very good
when your notation

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:22.000
makes it easy to
think and recognize

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.890
the equations that you have.

00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:30.400
And v hat in this,
are orthogonal spaces.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.900
v hat is perpendicular to vn.

00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.700
The inner product of any state
outside of degenerate space,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.090
with a state in the
general space, is 0.

00:14:46.130 --> 00:14:46.630
OK.

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:51.750
Very good.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:56.350
So let's now do the
important thing.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.560
I can do it here, I think.

00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.690
I'll do it here.

00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:06.360
So what do we want to do?

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.310
What is the question here?

00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:10.660
The question is the following.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:14.370
We have a state n0k.

00:15:14.370 --> 00:15:19.350
We have N of those
states, and we

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:23.250
want to figure out
what they become as you

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:25.200
turn on the perturbation.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:30.030
So using the old notation,
we'll say they become this.

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.340
And what is that going to be?

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:37.650
It is going to be n0k,
the original state, what

00:15:37.650 --> 00:15:42.270
it was, plus order lambda,
the first correction,

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:51.010
so n1 for this k state,
plus dot dot dot.

00:15:51.010 --> 00:15:55.210
For the energies, we have En0.

00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:58.780
That was the energy
of every state

00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.340
in the degenerate subspace.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:05.230
Now it's going to
become En lambda.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.590
But if I say En lambda I'm
already making a mistake,

00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:20.860
because I'm looking
at the fixed k.

00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:25.240
And a fixed k means we
chose one of these states,

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:29.800
and any single one of
the states, the energy

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.720
can grow in a different way.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:40.140
So I should call this
Enk, because we're

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:46.210
talking about this state,
will be equal to En0--

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:51.130
yes, they all have the same
first zeroth order energy.

00:16:51.130 --> 00:17:07.520
But then Enk1 plus lambda
squared Enk2 and so on.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:16.730
So this is the fate
of the kth state.

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:28.569
And the degeneracy will
be broken to first order

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:34.450
if these Enk's become different
numbers, because if they become

00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:37.120
different numbers in
lambda they're going

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.410
to start splitting the states.

00:17:39.410 --> 00:17:43.810
Remember this picture we had
last time of several states

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:45.100
at one point?

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.610
If the order lambda
corrections are different,

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:50.560
the states split.

00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.620
The degeneracy is resolved.

00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.680
And we can calculate
things more easily.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.620
If it's not resolved to
first order, it's harder.

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:04.210
It will be all of next
lecture to figure out

00:18:04.210 --> 00:18:06.910
what happens in that case.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:10.300
We discussed last time
that the n1 correction

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.980
didn't have any component
along the n0 vector.

00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:18.550
We could always
arrange that to happen.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:23.420
Here, we can arrange
something similar to happen.

00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:29.780
So we will still
assume, and we can

00:18:29.780 --> 00:18:36.350
check that's always
possible, that vnp,

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:50.060
the corrections to the state k
at order p for p equals 1, 2,

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:54.960
3, because it's not 0,
are orthogonal to n0k.

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:05.830
So this state doesn't have
any component along n0k,

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.960
and this state doesn't
have any component

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.010
along the original one.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.300
It's always possible to do
that, just like we did it

00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:15.580
in the non-degenerate case.

00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.950
Moreover, this is something
I want you to notice.

00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:27.450
We're saying that
the state n1 doesn't

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:31.860
have any component along
the state n0 for a given k,

00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:38.280
but the state n1 can
have components along n0

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.910
for a different k.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:46.980
So while they've nth order
or a pth order correction

00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.410
doesn't have
component along this,

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:54.240
it can have component
for an l here,

00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.430
where l is different from k.

00:19:56.430 --> 00:20:16.040
So it means that npk still
can have a component in vn.

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.020
Remember, vn is
this whole thing.

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.850
So if you're doing
the kth one, well, n1k

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.770
doesn't have a component
along that one,

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.320
but it may have a component
along all the others.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.120
So it may still have a
component, that correction,

00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.110
in vn.

00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.990
In fact, that's what will
make the problem a little hard

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:46.040
to do, but it's a good thing to
try to figure out this thing.

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:50.560
So what is the equation
we want to solve?

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:57.250
The usual equation, h
of lambda on nk lambda

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:05.860
is equal to Enk of
lambda nk of lambda.

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.830
So we produce the
general state that's

00:21:08.830 --> 00:21:11.380
its energy for the
full Hamiltonian.

00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:19.350
That's our Schrodinger equation.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:20.920
So what do we have to do?

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.640
We have to do exactly
what we did before,

00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:29.930
plug in that series, separate
the terms with various lambdas,

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:33.150
and see what we get.

00:21:33.150 --> 00:21:34.580
So here is what we get.

00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:48.830
To order lambda to the 0,
you get h0 minus En0 on n0k

00:21:48.830 --> 00:21:49.750
equals 0.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:59.340
And that equation, as it was
the case for the non-degenerate

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.770
case--

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.620
sorry for the redundancy--

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:06.420
it's trivially satisfied.

00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:10.560
We've stated that those are the
energies in the top equation

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.490
on that blackboard.

00:22:11.490 --> 00:22:13.980
So this equation we don't
need to worry about.

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:17.150
That's not too difficult.

00:22:17.150 --> 00:22:31.180
Lambda 1, h0 minus
En0 and 1k will

00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:40.495
be equal to Enk1
minus delta h n0k.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.910
Last equation.

00:22:51.910 --> 00:22:58.980
I'm starting to get lazy to
write them out, but we must.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:25.790
n2k is equal to minus delta
h and 1k plus Enk2 and 0k.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:38.100
OK and these equations
are equations for k fixed,

00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:42.600
but every term in the
equation has the same k,

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:46.560
but k then can run
from 1 up to n.

00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:52.675
So three equations times
n times, there we go.

00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.115
OK, these are our
equations this time.

00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.060
And we need to understand them.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:08.430
In fact, we need to solve them.

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:13.920
What we've gained experience
with the non-degenerate case

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.020
is going to come
very useful here,

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.440
although some things are not
going to be exactly the same.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:25.310
We're going to try to find
the energy corrections here,

00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:29.780
but calculating the state n1
is going to be a little harder.

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.250
We won't finish today--

00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:33.350
we won't have much time left--

00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:37.900
but what's going to
happen is that you

00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:47.400
can calculate the state n1,
the part in the space v hat.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.550
But the part in the
degenerate subspace,

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:54.500
where I said that npk
still can have a component

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.870
in the degenerate subspace,
cannot be calculated from this

00:24:57.870 --> 00:24:59.460
equation.

00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:03.570
So even when we're finished
doing this first equation,

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:05.160
you're going to
find this equation,

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.720
you still have not calculated
all of the states n1.

00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.080
You're going to have to go
through the second equation

00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:16.380
to find the missing
part of the state n1.

00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:20.720
So it's going to be
pretty interesting.

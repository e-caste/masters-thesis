00:00:23.024 --> 00:00:27.420
PROFESSOR: So I got much
more than one request

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.460
to do some stuff on
nuclear materials,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.840
and I think it's just
about the right time.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.105
That you guys know
enough about radiation

00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:35.730
interacting with
matter and everything,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.435
and stopping power,
and processing,

00:00:37.435 --> 00:00:40.300
to actually make sense of
nuclear materials and radiation

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:40.800
damage.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.432
And this is my whole
theme, so happy

00:00:43.432 --> 00:00:44.890
to come talk to
you guys about this

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:46.640
and show you why I
think it's interesting.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.530
Because it all goes--

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.160
this slide kind of gets onto it.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.180
It starts off with the
single-atom atomic defects

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.000
that make up the basic
building blocks of damage

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.090
and ends up with things that
break in nuclear reactors

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.188
under radiation.

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:02.730
And so to understand
the whole thing,

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.459
you've got to know everything
from the single atoms

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:07.405
on the sort of
femtosecond scale,

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:09.030
all the way up to
the engineering scale

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.930
where things evolve over
years or even decades.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.840
So we'll be talking--

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.030
first, probably
today, we're going

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.690
to go over a material
science primer.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.500
So who here has had any
courses in material science?

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.000
No one.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.950
That's good because I'm
assuming that there is a--

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.355
see, no one knows anything here.

00:01:25.355 --> 00:01:27.730
I know there's a couple material
scientists in the class,

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.430
and I'll apologize ahead of
time if it's a bit of a review.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.250
But we'll be going mostly
through what are materials

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.560
and what are the defects
that change their material

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.850
properties, and
how do they behave.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.710
That'll take us
through about today.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.150
So then tomorrow, we can see how
radiation causes those defects

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:47.418
and actually changes
material properties.

00:01:47.418 --> 00:01:49.460
So there's a whole laundry
list of different ways

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.620
that materials
fail, and most folks

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.510
are concerned with
all of these--

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.380
everything from simple
overload, which means you

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.900
stress something too
much and it just breaks,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.000
to all the different
forms of corrosion.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.788
That's a whole field in itself.

00:02:03.788 --> 00:02:05.330
And then there's
the things that just

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.150
we have to worry about
because they're only activated

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.100
with radiation damage.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.170
And in this case, this isn't
quite ionization by radiation,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:15.920
but it's actual radiation
slamming into nuclei

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.810
and moving atoms
out of their place.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.850
And we've got one figure
that we had recently

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.850
in a paper that sums up the
entire multi-scale picture

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.810
of radiation damage, from the
femtosecond to, let's say,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:28.918
the megasecond scale.

00:02:28.918 --> 00:02:30.210
Or I think it's more than that.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.670
Maybe gigasecond would be
the right word for that.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.970
And all the way down from the
angstrom to the meter scale.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.750
And I want to walk you
through sort of a lens scale

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.840
by lens scale depiction
of radiation damage.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.875
It all starts with knocking
atoms out of place.

00:02:45.875 --> 00:02:47.250
We've mentioned
this a little bit

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.620
when we talked about
nuclear stopping power,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.600
and this is where it
actually comes into play.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.170
Sometimes an incoming
neutron or photon or ion

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.740
can displace an atom
from its original site,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.830
and we call that a physical--
it's a displacement.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.960
And then that atom comes
off with quite a bit

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.590
of kinetic energy and can
knock into a whole bunch

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.090
of other atoms.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.240
Now this loss of the solid
crystalline structure,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.510
you can't really tell what the
original structure looked like,

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:16.710
right?

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.590
It actually comprises a
very small, localized zone

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.050
of melting called
a thermal spike.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.760
If you think about,
all these atoms

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.370
are vibrating at
fractions of an eV--

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.320
at thermal energies,
like the thermal neutrons

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.970
we talked about in the reactor.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.280
Then you hit them
with an MeV neutron.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.160
They might transfer
100 keV of energy.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.660
And a bunch of these
atoms will then

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.440
be moving about at, let's
say, a few hundred eV.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.350
That's way beyond
liquid temperature.

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.660
So actually, it's been
theorized that there's

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.020
a little pocket of atoms around
three to five nanometers wide

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.200
that reaches, like, 10,000
Kelvin for a very, very

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.270
short amount of time--

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.830
less than a picosecond.

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.690
Because almost
instantly, those atoms

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.090
knock into the ones
around them, and this

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:02.940
is how the process of
heat transfer occurs.

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.440
And so, very quickly,
you get what's

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.050
called the quench, where
most of those atoms

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.730
very quickly knock
into other ones,

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.180
slowing down, finding their
equilibrium positions again,

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.250
but not every one.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.310
You can see there's a few
places where the atoms are still

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.079
out of their original location.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.450
And it's those residual
defects that actually

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.090
comprise radiation damage.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.860
And as those defects build
up, they start to move.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.240
They can diffuse.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.040
They can be transported
ballistically

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.977
by more radiation damage.

00:04:32.977 --> 00:04:35.060
They can move by all sorts
of different mechanisms

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.008
and eventually find each other,
forming what's called clusters.

00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:41.300
So a bunch of those missing
atoms could find each other

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.490
and make a hole,
which we call a void.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.320
A bunch of the extra
atoms shoved in

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.870
between the other
ones can form things

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:49.970
called interstitial clusters.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.160
We say interstitial because
it's like in the space

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.090
in between where you'd
normally find some atoms.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.270
So let's say you had a whole
bunch of those missing atoms

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.520
come together, forming a void.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.060
This is an actual Transmission
Electron Microscope,

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.380
or TEM, image of a void--

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.380
pockets of vacuum in materials.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.263
Notice anything interesting
about its shape?

00:05:12.263 --> 00:05:14.110
AUDIENCE: It's, like, rounded.

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.350
PROFESSOR: It's rounded, but
what's most striking to me

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.850
is it isn't actually round.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.160
So you would expect a void or a
bubble to be kind of spherical,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.660
right?

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.740
That's the minimum energy
configuration of most things.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.600
Not so when you have a
little pocket of vacuum.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.370
It's where crystallinity
comes into play.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.350
And these voids can end up
forming superstructures.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:38.570
What curious thing
do you notice here?

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:42.775
For this whole
ensemble of voids.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:46.260
Yeah?

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.220
AUDIENCE: It seems like
they're all in line.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.827
PROFESSOR: They are all
in the same direction.

00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:51.410
Kind of funny.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:53.182
That's definitely not
an accident, right?

00:05:53.182 --> 00:05:54.890
That's not like they're
randomly aligned.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.432
There's a reason
for this, that we'll

00:05:56.432 --> 00:05:57.630
go into in a couple slides.

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:58.130
Yeah?

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:59.980
AUDIENCE: What's
the size scale here?

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.780
PROFESSOR: The size scale?

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.218
I think these are on the
order of 20 nanometers or so.

00:06:05.218 --> 00:06:07.510
Yeah, I cropped these images
just to get points across.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.610
Let's see if it says
in the older one.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:10.450
Not quite.

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.110
Yeah, but these voids can get
upwards of tens of nanometers.

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:15.300
As small as single atoms.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.800
Yeah?

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.250
AUDIENCE: Sorry, what is this?

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.080
PROFESSOR: This is
the accumulation

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.960
of radiation defects
into what's called voids.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:24.460
Yeah.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:28.390
Don't worry, we'll go over
it in more detail again.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:31.140
And if you get little pockets
of vacuum in your material,

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.890
you're not creating
or destroying mass.

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:34.330
You're just moving it.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.990
So those voids, where that mass
was has to go somewhere else,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.730
and you actually get
things that swell

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:41.480
in the reactor on their own.

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.780
They don't change mass
but they change volume.

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.810
They just kind of puff up
like Swiss cheese, sometimes

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.470
upwards of 20% or 30% changes
in diameter and length

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:51.640
for some tubing.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.950
Now if you're depending
on these fuel rods

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.740
being a certain space
apart in a reactor

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.920
and they start to swell,
squeezing out the coolant,

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:01.995
you lose the ability
to cool the reactor.

00:07:01.995 --> 00:07:04.120
Because then how can you
get water around something

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:06.248
where the tubes have
then swelled together?

00:07:06.248 --> 00:07:08.290
There's lots of other bad
things that can happen,

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:10.290
which we'll get into.

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.390
And so then that's the
origin of void swelling.

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.045
From single missing
atoms called vacancies,

00:07:15.045 --> 00:07:17.880
they can cluster
into voids which

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.120
then cause physical dimensional
changes of materials

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.650
on the scale of
centimeters to meters.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:26.610
And that's why we say it's
this full multi-scale picture

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:28.550
of radiation damage.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.230
But to understand,
what is damage,

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:32.420
you have to know what is
an undamaged structure

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:33.508
to begin with.

00:07:33.508 --> 00:07:36.050
So it doesn't make sense to say,
how does a structure change,

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:38.580
if you don't know
how it behaves.

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.350
So I want to give a very quick
primer to material science.

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.660
And apologies to any material
scientists in the room

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.910
because this is going
to seem really basic,

00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:50.060
but this is a very quick
intro to this whole field.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.220
I want to go over quickly,
what is a crystalline solid?

00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:55.520
A perfectly undamaged
material would

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.510
be a set of atoms lined up
in a very regular lattice

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:02.750
and of regular array, where you
move over a certain distance

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:04.280
and you find another atom.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.770
And this extends forever
and ever and ever,

00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:09.417
all the way out to when
you reach the free surface.

00:08:09.417 --> 00:08:11.750
And so this is what we would
call an undamaged material.

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:15.320
A pristine, perfect,
single crystal.

00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:17.510
By crystal, I mean
an arrangement

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.830
of atoms in a certain direction.

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:23.090
So notice here, all of the atoms
are lined up in, let's say,

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.730
some cubic xyz way.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.970
That's what we would call
one crystal or one grain.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.550
You'll hear both of those.

00:08:31.550 --> 00:08:34.640
And you'll notice also that
the arrangement of the atoms

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.600
tends to determine what the
physical objects look like.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.169
Or we like to say
that form follows

00:08:42.169 --> 00:08:44.780
structure in material science.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.540
So for materials
like pyrite, which

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.510
follows a simple cubic
structure, that's the crystals

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.980
you pull out of the ground.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.960
They mimic their
atomic configurations

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.030
in physical
centimeter-sized space.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:00.570
For gold atoms, they adopt a
slightly different structure.

00:09:00.570 --> 00:09:02.730
It's still cubic
but there is atoms

00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:04.710
shoved into the cube faces.

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.650
It's what we call
Face-Centered Cubic, or FCC.

00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:10.170
And you start to see
cube-looking structures

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:13.400
all over single
crystals of gold.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:14.780
Another one, gypsum.

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.660
It's got a very different type
of structure called monoclinic,

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:21.170
where none of the sides of
this parallelogram are the same

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:22.602
and there are some funny angles.

00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:24.560
But if you look at the
arrangement of the atoms

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.760
and the actual crystals
of gypsum that grow,

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.772
you see a striking similarity,
which I find pretty neat.

00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:35.240
I also want to mention, what
is the absence of structure

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.110
in material science?

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:38.360
We call that something
that's amorphous.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.430
Amorphous means without form.

00:09:40.430 --> 00:09:44.057
So for example, crystalline
indium phosphide

00:09:44.057 --> 00:09:45.890
would have this regular
structure like this.

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.270
You move over a
certain distance,

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:50.790
you see another green atom,
and so on and so on and so on.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:53.150
In an amorphous material,
it can still be a solid,

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.840
but there is no fixed distance
between any certain types

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:58.010
of atoms.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:10:01.220
And radiation can cause a
lot of this amorphization

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.320
by knocking the atoms about
and having them freeze

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.300
in random configurations.

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.170
This is one of the ways
that radiation damage can

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.660
embrittle materials because--

00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:12.720
well, we'll get into that.

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.050
So now let's talk
about the defects

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.742
that can be created
in a perfect crystal.

00:10:17.742 --> 00:10:19.450
The simplest ones, we
call point defects.

00:10:19.450 --> 00:10:21.770
They're zero-dimensional
because they're just

00:10:21.770 --> 00:10:23.990
single atoms out of place.

00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.490
You can have what's called
a vacancy, where if you had,

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:29.780
let's say, a face-centered
cubic lattice of atoms,

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.942
where you have atoms on every
cube corner and every face,

00:10:32.942 --> 00:10:34.400
if you just pull
one out somewhere,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.940
we refer to that as a vacancy.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.212
A missing atom.

00:10:38.212 --> 00:10:39.920
It had to go somewhere,
though, and we'll

00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.280
get to where it is
in just a second.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.680
So it might be kind of hard
to conceptualize, how do we

00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:48.520
know that there are missing
atoms in all these little cubes

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.960
or lattices?

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:52.980
We do have direct evidence.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.650
They're what's called
quenching studies,

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:58.010
where you can measure the
resistance or resistivity

00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:00.020
of a piece of material
after heating it

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:01.590
to a certain temperature.

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.040
Because it turns out that the
hotter you make something,

00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:07.310
the more of those vacancies
just naturally occur.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:10.610
You won't actually ever
find an absolutely perfect

00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.460
single crystal
anywhere in nature,

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.890
unless you go to zero
Kelvin for infinite time,

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.320
then the atoms arrange
themselves thusly.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.770
There's always some amount
of atomic vibration going on.

00:11:21.770 --> 00:11:26.120
And there's actually some
thermodynamic energy gain

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.910
to having a few defects
in your structure.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:32.120
And that number of
defects increases

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.730
with increasing temperature.

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.730
Once you get to the melting
point of a material,

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:38.750
or like right before something
melts, you can have up to 1

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.000
in 10,000 atoms just missing.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.590
Moved somewhere else.

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:44.360
We call that the
thermal equilibrium

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.940
vacancy concentration.

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.420
And we can measure that using
these resistivity measurements,

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.640
where you heat materials up to
higher and higher temperatures,

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:54.920
cool them down suddenly
in, like, liquid nitrogen

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.820
or liquid helium, and measure
the change in resistivity.

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:01.500
The more defects there are,
the harder it is for electrons

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.275
to flow through.

00:12:02.275 --> 00:12:04.650
And the only thing that could
really be responsible there

00:12:04.650 --> 00:12:09.030
in a single element
would be vacancies.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:12.170
So we do know that
these really exist.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.030
They can also cluster up.

00:12:14.030 --> 00:12:15.710
It turns out that
every time you have

00:12:15.710 --> 00:12:17.810
a vacancy in a material,
the other atoms

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:21.170
move in a little bit towards
it, relaxing the pressure they

00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:23.270
feel from the atoms nearby.

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:25.340
And one way for a whole
bunch of vacancies

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.700
to lower the stress of the
whole atomic configuration

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.720
is to cluster together.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:32.870
So if you have a whole
bunch of vacancies,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:36.380
they may not allow as
much stress accommodation

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:40.370
as if they were separate,
when they're together.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:44.257
Now you might ask, what
happened to the original atoms?

00:12:44.257 --> 00:12:46.340
You can't just take atoms
away and then go nowhere

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:48.458
because you can't just
destroy matter, right?

00:12:48.458 --> 00:12:50.000
Unless you turn it
into energy, which

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.070
is what we do in
nuclear engineering.

00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:55.010
So in the material
science world,

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.410
they end up as what's
called interstitials,

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.350
where you kind of have a
vacancy created from somewhere

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.210
that knocks that
atom out, and it

00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:07.040
gets stuck in the next biggest
space between some other atoms.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.750
And we refer to those
as interstitials.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:13.610
And those can cluster up, too,
to reduce their total stress

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:15.250
in the lattice.

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:17.740
They can cluster up into
what's called split dumbbell

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:18.940
interstitials.

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:21.820
Instead of having one
extra atom shoved in here,

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.470
you might rearrange
a couple so there's

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:26.260
two atoms in the center
of a cube instead of one.

00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:29.320
And that tends to be a lower
energy or a more stable

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.322
configuration.

00:13:32.322 --> 00:13:34.780
So let's look a little bit at
the energetics of these point

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:36.880
defects because
understanding how they move

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.803
and why will tell us a lot about
how radiation damage happens.

00:13:40.803 --> 00:13:42.220
So it turns out
that interstitials

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.990
are very hard to make.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.670
It's really hard
to shove an atom

00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:47.300
where it doesn't want to be.

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:52.350
But once you get it there,
it moves very easily.

00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:55.480
Let's draw a quick,
simple cubic lattice

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:57.460
to do a little
thought experiment

00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:58.930
and explore why that might be.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:05.590
Let's say I want to shove
an interstitial atom in here

00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:07.330
between these other atoms.

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:10.120
Well their electron
clouds are going to repel,

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.340
and it's going to push
all the nearby atoms away

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:13.690
by just a little bit.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:16.600
And these ones might
push the other atoms away

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.660
by just a little bit,
stretching out the lattice,

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.280
or adding some
compressive stress

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.830
wherever that interstitial is.

00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.255
But then how would it move?

00:14:28.255 --> 00:14:29.630
What's the biggest
barrier it has

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:32.660
to overcome to get to the
next adjacent location?

00:14:38.753 --> 00:14:40.170
Well, which direction
would it go?

00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:42.458
Would it go this way?

00:14:42.458 --> 00:14:43.000
Probably not.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.710
There's an atom in the way.

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:48.150
So it's going to find the
path of least resistance

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:51.690
to try to get over here,
because like we've talked about

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.120
before, all atoms
are always in motion.

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.158
Vibrating.

00:14:55.158 --> 00:14:56.700
Some of them will
be energetic enough

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.140
to squeeze through
these two atoms

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:00.390
and get over to the next site.

00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:03.390
And that turns out to be
a pretty easy process.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.840
We can look at the energy
required for an interstitial

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:07.800
to move.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.520
We notice it's really small
fractions of an electron volt,

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.310
whereas creating them takes
two or three electron volts.

00:15:14.310 --> 00:15:18.510
In atomic land, that's a
very high energy penalty.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:19.730
Now let's look at vacancies.

00:15:19.730 --> 00:15:21.640
They're quite the opposite.

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:23.850
They're rather easy
to make but they're

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:27.360
very hard to move,
compared to interstitials.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.890
Notice that the
energy of movement

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:32.070
is about the same as the energy
of formation for vacancies.

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:33.930
To take an atom out
or to pluck it out,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:37.860
you have to break every
bond between nearby atoms.

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:43.310
So you actually have to put
energy in to break those bonds

00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.550
and then remove the
atoms somewhere else.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.320
Now these things are
usually made in pairs,

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.740
so if you think about
how much energy would it

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:55.310
take to cause a single radiation
damage event where you have

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.870
one vacancy, which let's say
would have been right here,

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:03.110
and one interstitial, it takes
the sum of these two energies--

00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:05.480
usually about four
electron volts.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.880
That's not something
that tends to happen

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.360
chemically or from stress
or from something like that.

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:14.330
But radiation coming
in with hundreds of keV

00:16:14.330 --> 00:16:17.750
or even MeV neutrons,
anything's on the table

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.870
because it's high enough energy.

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:21.490
Yeah?

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.660
AUDIENCE: What would take
about three or four eV?

00:16:23.660 --> 00:16:25.618
PROFESSOR: So it would
take about three or four

00:16:25.618 --> 00:16:28.720
eV to make a pair of a
vacancy and an interstitial.

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.220
If you just add these two up.

00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:34.110
It comes usually to about three
or four eV, or electron volts.

00:16:34.110 --> 00:16:35.590
And that's a very
difficult thing

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:40.000
to do in sort of chemical world,
where reactions might proceed

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.070
with fractions of
an electron volt.

00:16:42.070 --> 00:16:45.010
But when you have MeV
neutrons coming in,

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:47.110
they do whatever they want.

00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:48.955
They'll do whatever they will.

00:16:48.955 --> 00:16:50.580
So someone actually
asked me yesterday,

00:16:50.580 --> 00:16:54.180
what sort of materials can
you put in the way of neutrons

00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:56.370
to stop them from doing damage?

00:16:56.370 --> 00:16:59.470
And the answer is,
pretty much nothing.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:03.210
Fast neutrons tend to travel
about 10 centimeters, even

00:17:03.210 --> 00:17:05.910
in things like steel
or water, and they're

00:17:05.910 --> 00:17:07.630
going to hit what
they're going to hit.

00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:10.980
There's not much you can do
but put more things in the way.

00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:13.619
And we can only get to a certain
density with regular matter.

00:17:13.619 --> 00:17:17.190
And I think osmium has
upwards of, like, 22 grams

00:17:17.190 --> 00:17:18.960
per cubic centimeter density.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.060
That's not enough
to stop neutrons,

00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.190
even over a
considerable distance.

00:17:23.190 --> 00:17:25.470
Unless you had, like,
liquid neutron star,

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:28.807
that you could pack nuclei in
at a way higher number density,

00:17:28.807 --> 00:17:29.640
not much you can do.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:34.850
So moving up in the
dimensions, there's

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:38.030
another type of defect
called a dislocation, where

00:17:38.030 --> 00:17:40.940
it's actually energetically
favorable to slide

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:45.920
an extra half-plane of atoms
in between two sets in here

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.220
in the crystal lattice, creating
a sort of bulged-out structure

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:51.010
like you see right here.

00:17:51.010 --> 00:17:53.930
And dislocations are one of
the most important defects

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:56.210
in material science
and radiation damage.

00:17:56.210 --> 00:17:59.120
They're what I like to call
the agents of plasticity.

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.150
If you deform a material
enough that it doesn't just

00:18:02.150 --> 00:18:07.610
spring back, then most likely,
you were creating and moving

00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:09.430
dislocations in the material.

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:11.720
If you think about a
couple of different ways

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.850
to cause deformation--

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:15.410
let's bring our
perfect lattice back

00:18:15.410 --> 00:18:20.280
without all these
extra notations.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:25.350
If you want to slide or shear
two planes of atoms across,

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:33.203
and they're all
bonded to each other,

00:18:33.203 --> 00:18:34.620
what do you
physically have to do?

00:18:40.028 --> 00:18:42.320
How can you get these atoms
to slide across each other?

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.870
What sort of energy do
you have to put into it?

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:48.517
Yeah?

00:18:48.517 --> 00:18:49.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] energy.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:50.670
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:52.890
Because all these atoms
are bonded to each other,

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:54.780
if you want them
to move, you have

00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:58.080
to break every
bond on that plane.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.600
That's a lot of
atomic bonds to break

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.180
and it's extremely unlikely
that that would happen.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:06.600
In fact, if you broke
an entire plane of bonds

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:11.164
in some material like this, what
would you physically do to it?

00:19:11.164 --> 00:19:13.860
You'd snap it in half.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:15.590
That would be fracture.

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:18.720
So if you broke every
bond down this plane,

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.480
you would then have two
pieces of this fuel rod.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.270
That's usually a pretty
high-energy thing to try to do.

00:19:24.270 --> 00:19:29.980
So instead, if you
shove an extra half

00:19:29.980 --> 00:19:34.850
plane of atoms in
there, and the bonds

00:19:34.850 --> 00:19:40.550
are kind of funny like so,
right at that extra half-plane

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:46.930
location, then what you can
actually do is break one.

00:19:46.930 --> 00:19:49.030
Let's say you break this
one, form the next one,

00:19:49.030 --> 00:19:51.880
then break this one
and form the next one.

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.190
And for a few
atoms to move over,

00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:57.970
you only have to break a
line of bonds, not a plane.

00:19:57.970 --> 00:20:01.450
So it's much less
energy-intensive to get

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:05.800
a dislocation to move than to
just break something in half.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.810
Now you might ask, well, then
why do things actually break?

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:10.670
Whether or not things
deform or break

00:20:10.670 --> 00:20:16.180
is a balance between this
process, which we call slip,

00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:21.300
and breaking an entire plane of
atoms, which we call fracture.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:22.470
So this one's called slip.

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:28.640
The other mode is fracture.

00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.600
We would rather materials to
form in systems like reactors

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:34.280
by slip, just
moving a little bit,

00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:36.200
then just breaking altogether.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.200
Unfortunately, when enough
radiation hits materials,

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.390
you can fracture things
in a brutal manner,

00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.920
and we'll see what happens then.

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:46.950
There's a couple
kinds of dislocations.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.480
One of them is called
a screw dislocation.

00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.080
So imagine you had a whole
bunch of sheets of atoms,

00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.630
and you made a cut
halfway through that sheet

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:58.080
and then moved every
plane up by one position.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.150
You then got what's called
a screw dislocation--

00:21:00.150 --> 00:21:04.080
kind of a spiral parking
garage of atoms surrounding

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.993
that core right there.

00:21:05.993 --> 00:21:08.410
You can also have what's called
an edge dislocation, which

00:21:08.410 --> 00:21:11.110
is like the one I've
got here on the board

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:14.170
right here, where you just have
an extra half plane of atoms

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.420
shoved in right there.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:20.120
So there's two types, and they
move in two different ways.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:24.100
The edge dislocation behaves
like you may physically expect.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.270
If you kind of push like
this on two planes of atoms,

00:21:28.270 --> 00:21:30.710
it moves in the
direction you push it.

00:21:30.710 --> 00:21:33.170
Screw dislocations
are kind of screwy.

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:38.225
If you push like this,
it moves perpendicular.

00:21:38.225 --> 00:21:40.100
Not going to get into
why, but just remember,

00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:42.200
screw dislocations are
fairly screwy in the way

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.060
that they behave.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:45.740
Not quite intuitive.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:46.410
But that's OK.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.540
We don't have to
worry about those.

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.400
And the way that
they actually move,

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:54.550
like we showed right here, is
by what's called glide, or slip,

00:21:54.550 --> 00:21:59.680
where dislocations can slide
just by one plane of atoms

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.920
or one atomic position
in a mechanism that

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.880
looks something like this.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.970
Where, as that
dislocation moves,

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:08.890
you only have to
break a line of bonds

00:22:08.890 --> 00:22:10.810
and then reform a
line of bonds, which

00:22:10.810 --> 00:22:12.460
is a much easier
process than breaking

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:14.458
an entire plane at once.

00:22:14.458 --> 00:22:16.250
It's like you have to
break the square root

00:22:16.250 --> 00:22:17.417
of the same number of bonds.

00:22:20.545 --> 00:22:22.420
I'm going to skip ahead
through some of that.

00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:24.820
There's one other mechanism
of dislocation movement

00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:27.340
that's important to
us in radiation damage

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.847
and that's called climb.

00:22:28.847 --> 00:22:30.430
This is when you
start to think about,

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:33.910
what happens if you have
a dislocation, which we'll

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:40.300
give this symbol right here,
and you also have a vacancy,

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:42.910
let's say created
by radiation damage.

00:22:42.910 --> 00:22:44.590
If that vacancy can
move, it's going

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:47.650
to find the most stressed-out
part of this lattice.

00:22:47.650 --> 00:22:51.710
Most likely, the
vacancy will move here.

00:22:51.710 --> 00:22:56.550
In other words, the atom
will move over there,

00:22:56.550 --> 00:22:59.472
leaving this vacancy over there.

00:22:59.472 --> 00:23:01.430
It's kind of funny to
think, like, what does it

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:03.168
mean that a vacancy moves?

00:23:03.168 --> 00:23:05.210
Has anyone ever done
anything with semiconductors

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:08.280
and talked about electron
and hole movement?

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:08.790
OK, yeah.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:12.060
So what does it really mean
for a hole to move, right?

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:13.240
A hole's not a thing.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:14.590
A vacancy's also not a thing.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.660
It's an absence of an atom.

00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:18.690
But here, we can say
that the vacancy moves

00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:21.660
in this direction when the
corresponding atom moves

00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:23.760
in the exact opposite direction.

00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.650
And then what
you've actually done

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:29.240
is moved your dislocation up.

00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:31.790
Instead of moving in
the slip direction,

00:23:31.790 --> 00:23:36.040
you've now moved it in a
perpendicular direction.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:38.980
This is usually not
possible without things

00:23:38.980 --> 00:23:41.518
like radiation damage or
very high temperature.

00:23:43.907 --> 00:23:45.490
And then, to make
things even crazier,

00:23:45.490 --> 00:23:47.060
you can also have
what's called loops

00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:49.143
of dislocation, some videos
of which I'll actually

00:23:49.143 --> 00:23:50.360
get to show you.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.690
You can have a dislocation that
has part edge character, part

00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:54.732
screw character.

00:23:54.732 --> 00:23:56.690
If you look at how the
atoms are arranged here,

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.037
you're looking from
sort of the top-down.

00:23:59.037 --> 00:24:00.620
You can see that
there's an extra half

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.040
plane of these white atoms
shoved in in the black ones,

00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.210
and this right here would be
a completely edge dislocation.

00:24:08.210 --> 00:24:09.950
You can have a
gradual transition,

00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:13.640
where about 90 degrees
later, it looks like a spiral

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:15.840
and that's a screw dislocation.

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.840
And the net effect
of that is when

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.600
you push in this direction
on an edge dislocation,

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.370
it moves that way.

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:24.750
When you push this direction
on a screw dislocation,

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.520
it moves that way.

00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.780
So when you stress out
a dislocation loop,

00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.600
it just grows.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:34.240
You're not actually creating
or destroying matter,

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:38.170
but what you're doing is causing
this small loop of extra half

00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.840
plane of atoms to grow further
and further until it actually

00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:46.000
reaches some obstacle or
the outside of a crystal.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.400
And these dislocations
can actually

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.800
feel the force from each other.

00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.220
If I draw a clean one because I
think it'll be easier to see--

00:24:56.770 --> 00:24:58.580
if I draw a small
lattice of atoms

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:07.540
here and then a dislocation
core right there.

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:09.630
So that's our dislocation core.

00:25:09.630 --> 00:25:15.350
This region of space right
here is compressively stressed.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.270
There's more atoms in that
space than there want to be

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:20.060
and so it's kind of
crammed in there.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:24.250
While this region
right here is in what's

00:25:24.250 --> 00:25:26.080
called tensile stress.

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:29.230
There's almost some space,
like right here, where

00:25:29.230 --> 00:25:33.220
there's too few atoms and they
kind of want there to be more.

00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:37.180
And these dislocations can
feel neighboring stress fields.

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:39.820
Let's say there was
another one right over here

00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:43.500
that had its own
compressive stress field.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:46.300
They'll actually
repel each other

00:25:46.300 --> 00:25:49.120
because you don't want to add
even more compressive stress

00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.160
to anywhere in this
group of atoms.

00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:53.447
So they'll actually repel
each other to the point

00:25:53.447 --> 00:25:55.030
where, if you get
two dislocations too

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:59.630
close to each other, they'll
what's called pile-up,

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.113
or they'll refuse to move a bit.

00:26:02.113 --> 00:26:03.530
So I want to show
you some videos.

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.540
We can actually see
these dislocations.

00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:09.200
In this one, you see that faint
line right there originating

00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.940
from this area?

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:14.270
That's actually a
dislocation loop under stress

00:26:14.270 --> 00:26:15.600
and that's actually growing.

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.930
So what you're seeing
here is an image

00:26:17.930 --> 00:26:20.450
of electrons passing
through material

00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:22.940
and looking at regions
of different contrast.

00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.010
So wherever there is more
atoms or fewer atoms,

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:28.190
it looks darker or lighter,
and that can tell you

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.510
what sort of defects there are.

00:26:29.510 --> 00:26:32.152
You guys all see that
faint line right there?

00:26:32.152 --> 00:26:33.610
Notice how the
loop's just growing.

00:26:33.610 --> 00:26:35.068
It's not like you're
moving a line,

00:26:35.068 --> 00:26:36.730
but you're literally
growing a line out

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:37.855
of what looks like nothing.

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:44.110
There's another one we
call a Frank-Read source.

00:26:44.110 --> 00:26:46.510
It's a source of
dislocation loop.

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:49.030
So what you're seeing
here, each of these lines

00:26:49.030 --> 00:26:50.290
is a single dislocation.

00:26:50.290 --> 00:26:54.520
And then right there, you
see that loop suddenly form?

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.110
Let's show you that one again.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:58.987
I'll point on where to look.

00:26:58.987 --> 00:27:00.820
By stressing out
materials, you can actually

00:27:00.820 --> 00:27:05.161
create additional dislocation
loops, right around here.

00:27:05.161 --> 00:27:07.000
And there it is.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.410
You guys see that one?

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:08.923
Yeah.

00:27:08.923 --> 00:27:10.840
Out of what looks like
nothing but is actually

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.970
just a couple of
atomic defects, you

00:27:12.970 --> 00:27:15.910
can create a dislocation
loop and allow more plastic

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:21.355
deformation to take place,
which I think is awesome.

00:27:21.355 --> 00:27:22.150
Look at this one.

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:24.160
Another dislocation
source in germanium.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.140
It's a little
easier to see, also

00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:29.800
because it's making this sort
of spiral set of dislocations

00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.330
a little slower.

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.500
So you can track its
motion a little easier.

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:38.330
Notice how they all kind of line
up on certain atomic planes.

00:27:38.330 --> 00:27:38.830
Yeah?

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.163
AUDIENCE: Does the topology
of these things ever change,

00:27:41.163 --> 00:27:44.150
or is it always just
a slow [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:44.150 --> 00:27:45.877
PROFESSOR: The
topology will change.

00:27:45.877 --> 00:27:47.460
Let's say, if it
hits another obstacle

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:48.877
or another
dislocation, yeah, they

00:27:48.877 --> 00:27:51.510
can slam into each other
and change topology.

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:54.390
AUDIENCE: Breaking
too [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:56.447
PROFESSOR: All sorts
of things, yeah.

00:27:56.447 --> 00:27:58.530
That's a subject for a
whole other class, I'd say.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.570
I want to skip
ahead to the pile-up

00:28:03.570 --> 00:28:07.140
because I think this kind
of gets the point across.

00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:09.330
But actually, we can
see direct evidence

00:28:09.330 --> 00:28:11.970
that dislocations feel
each other's stress fields.

00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:15.000
When you get enough of them
lined up, they won't overlap.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.180
They actually push each other
in a kind of dislocation traffic

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.280
jam.

00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.740
Because what's happening
on the atomic level is,

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.300
they feel each
other's stress fields.

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.945
There might be a source of
dislocations further away,

00:28:26.945 --> 00:28:28.950
but when they get too
close to each other,

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:31.500
it literally is a
dislocation traffic jam.

00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.660
I mean, if you try and hit
the car in front of you,

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:36.900
the repulsion of the electrons
between your and their bumper

00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:39.900
will prevent the cars from
getting a certain distance

00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.370
closer to each other.

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:42.390
Same kind of thing here.

00:28:45.890 --> 00:28:49.100
Moving onto grain boundaries,
a two-dimensional defect.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:51.950
Any time you have
a perfect crystal

00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:54.980
of atoms that meets
another perfect crystal

00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.110
at a different orientation,
or where the atoms

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.880
are arranged in a
different direction,

00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.920
you end up with a
boundary between them

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.990
that we refer to as
a grain boundary.

00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:06.950
So you can actually see, this
is a direct physical image

00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:10.280
of atoms of two different
crystals meaning at the grain

00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.120
boundary.

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.430
Again, taken in the transmission
electron microscope.

00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:14.847
So for those who
didn't know, yes,

00:29:14.847 --> 00:29:19.085
we can see individual atoms
and the defects between them.

00:29:19.085 --> 00:29:20.960
I definitely didn't know
that in high school.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:22.668
They didn't even
mention that whatsoever.

00:29:22.668 --> 00:29:25.360
Did you guys ever
see images like this?

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:25.990
Anyone?

00:29:25.990 --> 00:29:26.490
Yes?

00:29:26.490 --> 00:29:27.760
Raise your hand.

00:29:27.760 --> 00:29:29.140
Just one, OK.

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:29.830
So yeah.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:31.060
It's important for
you guys to know

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:33.643
that we can have direct evidence
for all this blackboard stuff

00:29:33.643 --> 00:29:36.460
because you can see atoms
in the transmission electron

00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:39.880
microscope and see what happens
when the two of them meet.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:43.240
You see this kind of regular
structure of empty space

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.280
where this grain
boundary meets, right?

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.830
You can actually model it as
a line of 1-D dislocations,

00:29:49.830 --> 00:29:52.640
because if you take
a line of 1-D lines,

00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.830
you end up with a
2-D boundary, which

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.130
you can see very clearly here.

00:29:56.130 --> 00:29:58.505
It's almost like there's an
extra half plane right there.

00:29:58.505 --> 00:30:02.420
Another one there, another one
there, and another one there.

00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:05.190
And we call that a
tilt grain boundary.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:08.010
Grain boundaries are nice in
that they can accommodate lots

00:30:08.010 --> 00:30:10.860
of these little
zero-dimensional defects,

00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.890
moving to them without
getting destroyed.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.630
So grain boundaries
are one of those ways

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:19.140
that radiation damage
can be removed.

00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:21.780
And that's one of the reasons
why most small-grain materials

00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:22.560
are really--

00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.980
nano-grain materials are more
resistant to radiation damage

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:28.020
than large-grain
ones because they

00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:33.390
act as what's called sinks or
destroyers of radiation damage.

00:30:33.390 --> 00:30:37.860
There's another kind of 2-D
defect called a twin, where

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.700
you can actually get a little
chunk of atoms sort of switch

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.630
orientation.

00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:45.900
And you can see these very
clearly in, again, TEM

00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:50.760
micrographs, and the evidence
actually that the twin actually

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:52.680
is a different physical
arrangement of atoms,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.430
even though you can't see
the atoms in this little band

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:57.780
right there.

00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:00.540
Look at the way the
dislocations line up.

00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:02.190
Those dislocations
tend to line up

00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.190
in energetically-favorable
directions, and in this grain,

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:08.280
they're all this
way, and in the twin,

00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:13.013
they're all lined up like that.

00:31:13.013 --> 00:31:15.180
And then finally, there's
the most intuitive defect,

00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:16.380
inclusions.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:19.740
A 3-D piece of some other
material inside what

00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.880
would otherwise be
a pure material.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:25.530
This one, I actually pulled
out of the rotor that powers

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:27.240
the Alcator fusion reactor.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.790
I was asked to do some
analysis to find out,

00:31:29.790 --> 00:31:32.670
is the structure of
that rotor changing,

00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:36.622
because General Electric who
was insuring this rotor said,

00:31:36.622 --> 00:31:38.080
we don't want to
insure it anymore.

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.400
Thanks for the premiums, but
we're not insuring it anymore.

00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.400
And we said, why?

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.400
And they said, oh, it's
structurally unsound.

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.840
So we said, oh yeah?

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.150
We'll be back in a year
and we'll talk about it.

00:31:48.150 --> 00:31:50.315
And we did a lot of
this work to find out

00:31:50.315 --> 00:31:52.440
that, actually, the structure
hadn't really changed

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.020
since 1954 when it was made.

00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.600
But what we did also
see is we could pop out

00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.320
little precipitates
of manganese sulfide.

00:32:01.320 --> 00:32:03.750
So there's always
sulfur in iron,

00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:05.550
and sulfur tends to
be a bad actor when it

00:32:05.550 --> 00:32:07.590
comes to material properties.

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:10.170
You throw manganese
into iron to scoop up

00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:13.050
that sulfur in the form of
these little precipitates

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:16.170
or inclusions, which we
were able to see perfectly

00:32:16.170 --> 00:32:18.150
when we did an x-ray
map, just like the one we

00:32:18.150 --> 00:32:20.400
did after the first exam.

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:23.910
It's like we were looking at
Chris' copper silver alloy,

00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.947
mapping out where is
the copper and silver.

00:32:25.947 --> 00:32:27.780
I made this image the
same way, mapping out,

00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:29.682
where is there iron,
manganese and sulfur.

00:32:29.682 --> 00:32:31.140
That's how you can
tell what it is.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:37.160
And so dislocations and
defects can actually interact.

00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.540
Let's say this is
the interaction

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:45.200
of a 1-D defect, a dislocation,
with a 3-D defect, a void.

00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:47.840
If you have a material
that's deforming plastically,

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.330
very smoothly, and isn't
going to undergo fracture,

00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.910
you want the dislocations
to be able to move.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:56.990
If you put anything in their
way, they tend to get stuck.

00:32:56.990 --> 00:32:58.850
It's not easy for
that dislocation

00:32:58.850 --> 00:33:01.260
to shear through a whole
bunch of extra atoms.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.230
And in some cases, you can
stop that motion and favor

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:09.940
fracture over slip.

00:33:09.940 --> 00:33:12.370
So any time you
make slip harder,

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.668
it means that you're making
fracture more likely.

00:33:14.668 --> 00:33:16.210
I didn't say you're
making it easier,

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:18.070
but you're making
it more likely.

00:33:18.070 --> 00:33:19.570
And you would
prefer for materials

00:33:19.570 --> 00:33:25.940
to deform a little bit by a slip
than just break by fracture.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.320
So I think now is a good point
to go over a few key material

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.110
properties.

00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:35.040
All of these are sometimes
used to describe the same thing

00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.750
in colloquial speech.

00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:39.253
That is wrong.

00:33:39.253 --> 00:33:40.920
Has anyone here thought
that, let's say,

00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:45.600
stiffness or toughness or
strength meant the same thing?

00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.100
No.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:46.930
OK.

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:47.570
A few people.

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:48.500
It's OK.

00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:52.010
Because it's used wrong all
the time in colloquial speech.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.470
These actually refer to
different material properties

00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:55.568
with different units.

00:33:55.568 --> 00:33:57.860
And we're going to go into
a little bit about what they

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.680
are and then show
you a few videos

00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.610
to test your intuition about
the differences between them.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:07.690
So first, I want to mention
what you're seeing right here.

00:34:07.690 --> 00:34:10.239
It's called a
stress-strain curve.

00:34:10.239 --> 00:34:11.739
Stress is simple.

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:13.960
Stress is just a force
divided by an area.

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.690
And usually, the
criterion for will

00:34:19.690 --> 00:34:22.030
a material deform
or will it break

00:34:22.030 --> 00:34:24.340
is does it reach
a certain stress.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.630
It doesn't matter just how
much force you put on it,

00:34:26.630 --> 00:34:28.480
but it's like, how
much force per atom

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.300
or how much force per area
determines whether bonds

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.860
are going to break.

00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.449
And so on the y-axis is stress.

00:34:34.449 --> 00:34:38.530
Let's say the amount of force
per area we're putting in.

00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:43.449
And strain is the
amount of deformation.

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:44.420
So that's stress.

00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:49.100
And strain is, let's
say, the change in length

00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.460
over the original length
of some material in what's

00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.449
called the engineering
or simplified notation.

00:34:55.449 --> 00:34:57.740
And so something
that is stiff means

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:00.360
you can put a lot
of force into it

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.760
but it won't deform very much.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.295
That's kind of the easiest
property to understand.

00:35:04.295 --> 00:35:06.680
Is something that's
very stiff will

00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:08.540
have what's called a
high Young's modulus,

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:11.480
or a high slope right here.

00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:13.940
Something that's super
stiff, like a ceramic,

00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:17.070
you could really push
on it quite a bit,

00:35:17.070 --> 00:35:20.660
but you won't get it to deform
like you would this metal.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.720
So the opposite of stiff,
I would call compliant.

00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.160
Not soft.

00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.140
This is one of those
tricky things right there.

00:35:27.140 --> 00:35:30.410
Something that's stiff, you try
and flex it and it won't flex.

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:33.020
Something that's compliant,
you put a little bit of force

00:35:33.020 --> 00:35:37.840
into it and it undergoes
some amount of strain.

00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:40.430
And that slope right
there between the stress

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:44.300
and the strain, we call
the Young's modulus.

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:46.340
We also note that
this part right here

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.790
is what's called the elastic
region of deformation.

00:35:49.790 --> 00:35:53.050
By elastic, we mean reversible,
or it snaps right back.

00:35:53.050 --> 00:35:57.290
So right here, when I bend this
bar and it snaps right back,

00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:59.030
that's called
elastic deformation.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:02.090
And it's reversible,
because you can bend one way

00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:03.650
and it snaps right back.

00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:05.720
If I bent it more,
which I don't want

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.290
to do because this is a nice
zirconium fuel cladding rod,

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:10.880
you would deform
it irreversibly.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.950
You'd bend it permanently.

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:16.250
And to undergo what's called
plastic deformation, when

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:19.790
you deviate from the slope, and
then a little bit more stress

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:21.880
can cause a lot
more deformation.

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.170
Have any of you guys ever
tried pulling copper wire

00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.830
apart before?

00:36:27.312 --> 00:36:29.520
That's something I'd recommend
you try, for thin wire

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:31.250
so you don't cut your hands.

00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:34.220
What you may notice is that
it's awfully hard to get

00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:36.740
the copper deforming
in the first place,

00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:40.165
but as soon as it starts to
stretch, it gets really easy.

00:36:40.165 --> 00:36:41.540
So this is something
I recommend.

00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.460
Go to the electronics
shop or wherever

00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:45.960
and try it out on some
really thin copper wire.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:47.960
If it's thick, you'll
slice through your fingers

00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.350
and you don't want to do that.

00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:54.090
Strength, however, that's
a different metric.

00:36:54.090 --> 00:36:57.070
Whereas stiffness
describes the slope here,

00:36:57.070 --> 00:37:01.450
strength describes the height,
or the stress at which you

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.130
start to plastically deform.

00:37:03.130 --> 00:37:05.420
They're in different units.

00:37:05.420 --> 00:37:08.540
Stiffness is in
stress over strain,

00:37:08.540 --> 00:37:12.870
whereas strength is
given as a stress.

00:37:12.870 --> 00:37:14.610
So when you hear
things like the yield

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:16.440
stress or the ultimate
tensile strength,

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.810
that's referring to how
strong something is,

00:37:18.810 --> 00:37:22.010
which may have nothing to
do with how stiff it is.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:24.560
Toughness is another property.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.760
Toughness is actually kind of
like the area under this curve,

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:32.720
because if you do a force
and apply it over a distance,

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.000
that's like putting
work into the material

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.720
and it ends up being
a unit of energy.

00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:39.630
So toughness will tell
you how much energy

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.210
you have to put into
something before creating

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:45.930
a new free surface,
otherwise known as fracture.

00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:49.940
And ductility is how much can
you deform it before it breaks.

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:54.800
So it would be like this point
right here on the strain axis.

00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.480
So I'll give a little
bit more examples

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:59.820
of what this is all about.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:02.160
Toughness, again,
is actually measured

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.150
as an energy required
to form a free surface,

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:08.970
or propagate a crack, let's say.

00:38:08.970 --> 00:38:10.877
Whereas something
that's ductile,

00:38:10.877 --> 00:38:12.710
it doesn't necessarily
mean that it's tough.

00:38:12.710 --> 00:38:15.350
Like, if you have a piece
of chewed chewing gum,

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:18.410
you can stretch it quite a
lot with very little energy.

00:38:18.410 --> 00:38:21.110
And then you can say it's
extremely ductile but not

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:22.650
very strong.

00:38:22.650 --> 00:38:24.830
A piece of copper
wire, you can also

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:27.320
stretch it an
extremely far distance,

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:29.360
but it takes more
energy to do so.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.660
So that's both
ductile and strong.

00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.150
And then if you apply that
force over a certain distance,

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.400
stretching out the
wire, you can also

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.590
reveal some of its toughness
and how much energy

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:44.170
it takes to stretch that
wire before it breaks.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.820
Hardness is the last material
property I want to mention,

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:50.200
which is not any of
the ones that I showed

00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:52.380
on the stress-strain curve.

00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.240
Hardness is the
resistance to a little bit

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.160
of plastic deformation.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:59.010
So assuming that
you're already here,

00:38:59.010 --> 00:39:00.810
how much more energy
do you have to put in

00:39:00.810 --> 00:39:02.455
to get the material
to deform plastic?

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.050
So very different
material properties.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:11.320
I'll try and mention
all what they are.

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:16.660
So if we have a
stress-strain curve like so,

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:19.150
and it follows
the elastic region

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:22.480
and then deforms
plastically, this point

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:24.730
here is what we call
the yield strength.

00:39:31.300 --> 00:39:35.200
Whatever that point
on the stress axis is.

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.340
This point right here,
our strain to failure,

00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:43.940
we can use as a
measure of ductility.

00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:50.470
This slope right here
refers to the stiffness.

00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:54.910
And finally, this
energy right here

00:39:54.910 --> 00:39:56.490
is something like the toughness.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.270
And the hardness isn't
quite on this plot.

00:40:02.270 --> 00:40:04.940
So I want to see if
you guys intuitively

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:06.880
understand this, because
the next lecture,

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:09.830
I'm going to be throwing around
the words like stiffness,

00:40:09.830 --> 00:40:12.440
toughness, ductility,
hardness, compliance,

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:14.690
hard, soft, whatever,
and I want to make sure

00:40:14.690 --> 00:40:17.360
that you just at least
intuitively understand.

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.310
There's a few videos you
may have seen before.

00:40:19.310 --> 00:40:22.260
Anyone here watch the
hydraulic press channel?

00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:22.860
There we go.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:25.150
Finally, something that
half the class does.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.820
We're going to
predict what's going

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.210
to happen in each of these
cases based on these material

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.350
properties.

00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:35.370
So in this case, this is a
pressurized cylinder of CO2.

00:40:35.370 --> 00:40:39.460
It's made of aluminum, which
is a very ductile material.

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.685
It's also a very tough material.

00:40:41.685 --> 00:40:43.560
How do you think it will
deform when smashed?

00:40:50.672 --> 00:40:51.630
Anyone ever tried this?

00:40:51.630 --> 00:40:52.990
Squishing aluminum stuff.

00:40:52.990 --> 00:40:54.074
What happens?

00:40:54.074 --> 00:40:56.035
AUDIENCE: You compress it.

00:40:56.035 --> 00:40:57.160
PROFESSOR: You compress it.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.077
And then what happens?

00:41:00.772 --> 00:41:02.600
AUDIENCE: Fracture?

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.882
PROFESSOR: Will it fracture?

00:41:03.882 --> 00:41:05.022
AUDIENCE: After a while.

00:41:05.022 --> 00:41:06.230
PROFESSOR: After a while, OK.

00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:08.570
If you put a lot of energy
into it, eventually,

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:11.780
when you reach this strain to
failure, it should fracture.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.360
But in your personal
hands-on experience,

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.017
does aluminum tend to fracture
when you bend it a little bit?

00:41:17.017 --> 00:41:18.510
AUDIENCE: No.

00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:23.310
PROFESSOR: So then what words
would you use to describe it?

00:41:23.310 --> 00:41:25.410
Based on this curve right here.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:28.980
Yep?

00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:29.790
AUDIENCE: Ductile.

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:30.582
PROFESSOR: Ductile.

00:41:30.582 --> 00:41:32.600
I would say ductile
and not brittle

00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.810
because you can bend it quite
a bit or stretch it quite a bit

00:41:35.810 --> 00:41:37.480
before it fractures.

00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.540
How about stiffness?

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.000
Is it really hard or really
easy to get aluminum bending?

00:41:43.690 --> 00:41:44.815
AUDIENCE: It's pretty easy.

00:41:44.815 --> 00:41:45.982
PROFESSOR: It's fairly easy.

00:41:45.982 --> 00:41:47.740
So would you call that
stiff or compliant?

00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.573
AUDIENCE: Compliant.

00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:49.448
PROFESSOR: Compliant.

00:41:49.448 --> 00:41:50.080
OK.

00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:51.430
What about strength?

00:41:51.430 --> 00:41:53.830
How hard is it to start
deforming aluminum

00:41:53.830 --> 00:41:56.800
irreversibly, compared
to something like steel?

00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:58.060
AUDIENCE: Not very.

00:41:58.060 --> 00:41:59.080
PROFESSOR: Not very.

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:00.130
Especially pure aluminum.

00:42:00.130 --> 00:42:02.320
You can chew through it.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.990
If you guys ever got a
one yen coin from Japan,

00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:07.480
you can chew through it.

00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.160
Not very strong.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:12.292
Then again, your bite force
is also incredibly strong.

00:42:12.292 --> 00:42:13.750
But anyway, let's
see what actually

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:18.550
happens when you compress a
rather ductile, compliant,

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:21.475
and not that strong
aluminum canister.

00:42:24.364 --> 00:42:25.800
Is it actually going?

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:28.770
Oh, it actually skipped ahead.

00:42:28.770 --> 00:42:30.750
That's what I wanted,
was their sound.

00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.685
It was also
pressurized with CO2.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:44.170
But notice what's left.

00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:45.460
So actually watch in slow-mo.

00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:49.210
Look how much you can compress
that, even after the explosion.

00:42:49.210 --> 00:42:51.858
No fracture.

00:42:51.858 --> 00:42:54.150
If you had done that with,
let's say, a glass canister,

00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:55.230
what do you guys think
would have happened?

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:56.140
AUDIENCE: It would
have shattered.

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:57.340
PROFESSOR: It would
have shattered.

00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:59.280
Yeah, we'll see that in
a bit with a material

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.140
that may surprise you.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:04.615
AUDIENCE: So it basically
doesn't fracture, right?

00:43:04.615 --> 00:43:06.240
PROFESSOR: It will
fracture eventually,

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.720
but the hydraulic press can't
get it that far in compression.

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:12.480
So that would be something
that's extremely ductile, not

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.270
that strong--

00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:15.030
so it wasn't that
hard to deform.

00:43:15.030 --> 00:43:18.210
Certainly we know it wasn't
stronger than the steel base

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:21.090
plate that they used
to do the smashing.

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:22.680
Because whatever's
the softer material

00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.972
is going to deform more.

00:43:23.972 --> 00:43:26.430
So here he's going to have--
well I'll let him describe it,

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:29.232
and then I'll let you guess
what's going to happen.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.950
What do you guys think
is going to happen?

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.930
You've got what looks like
brass and copper coins

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:01.470
on a steel base plate.

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:04.170
Anyone have any idea?

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:05.376
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:05.376 --> 00:44:06.670
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:08.170
Everyone's making
this motion, which

00:44:08.170 --> 00:44:11.620
means everything's going
to flatten out, right?

00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:12.610
Let's find out.

00:44:24.423 --> 00:44:26.340
Not nearly as much as
you might have expected.

00:44:45.970 --> 00:44:49.060
Is anyone surprised by this?

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.540
What happened there?

00:44:51.540 --> 00:44:55.320
What actually happened there
was already described up here.

00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:58.290
When you get enough dislocations
piling up against each other

00:44:58.290 --> 00:45:01.410
during plastic deformation,
you can undergo a process

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.011
called work hardening.

00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:10.280
That process can be
physically described

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.830
by a lot of those dislocations
piling up and making

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:16.717
it more and more difficult
to continue that deformation.

00:45:16.717 --> 00:45:18.800
So what happened here is
the brass and the copper,

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:23.150
which started out quite soft,
not that hard, quite ductile,

00:45:23.150 --> 00:45:28.400
as you can see, and not that
strong actually got stronger

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.820
as they were deformed.

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:32.050
Interesting, huh?

00:45:32.050 --> 00:45:34.700
Did anyone expect
this to happen?

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.060
OK.

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:38.310
Let's go to one that I think
everyone can guess what's

00:45:38.310 --> 00:45:41.330
going to happen, a lead ball.

00:45:41.330 --> 00:45:44.400
So has anyone ever tried
playing with lead before?

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.340
Hopefully not.

00:45:46.340 --> 00:45:47.020
I have quite a--

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:48.793
OK good, I'm not alone.

00:45:48.793 --> 00:45:50.960
How would you describe lead
in terms of the material

00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:51.710
properties here?

00:45:55.702 --> 00:45:57.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:57.700 --> 00:45:58.440
PROFESSOR: Yep.

00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.450
It's not very stiff.

00:45:59.450 --> 00:46:01.710
It doesn't take much energy
to start deforming it.

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:02.310
How else?

00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:07.150
Was it hard or soft?

00:46:07.150 --> 00:46:08.090
AUDIENCE: Soft.

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:08.720
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:12.320
Do you think it's
ductile or brittle?

00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:12.872
Yeah?

00:46:12.872 --> 00:46:13.830
AUDIENCE: It's brittle.

00:46:13.830 --> 00:46:15.400
PROFESSOR: You
think it's brittle.

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.460
So by that, you mean it's just
going to break apart, right?

00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:21.550
If you deform it?

00:46:21.550 --> 00:46:22.800
OK, cool.

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.280
And would you say it
is tough or not tough?

00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:30.870
Not a lot of folks have
hands-on experience with lead.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:33.000
It's probably good
for your brains.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:33.690
Let's find out.

00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.950
Lead pancake.

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:02.703
So what words would you use to
describe what just happened?

00:47:02.703 --> 00:47:03.670
AUDIENCE: It's ductile.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.233
PROFESSOR: Ductile indeed.

00:47:05.233 --> 00:47:06.900
I don't know what
sort of brittle lead--

00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:09.341
was it an alloy that you had
been playing with, maybe?

00:47:09.341 --> 00:47:10.883
AUDIENCE: It was
like a little sheet.

00:47:10.883 --> 00:47:12.110
It was just easy to snap.

00:47:12.110 --> 00:47:13.290
PROFESSOR: Aha, OK.

00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:15.870
So it was a sheet of lead
that was easy to snap.

00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:18.660
So I would not call lead
as a very tough material

00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:21.450
because you didn't have to
put a lot of energy into it,

00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:24.420
but did it deform quite a bit
before you snapped it or did

00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.957
it just crumble apart?

00:47:25.957 --> 00:47:27.420
AUDIENCE: Oh, it deformed.

00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.290
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:47:28.290 --> 00:47:31.740
So in that case, I would call
it ductile because it deformed

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:34.620
a lot before breaking,
but I would not

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.680
call it tough because it took
very little energy to get it

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.540
to that breaking point.

00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:42.310
And it wasn't that stiff because
it was quite easy to get it--

00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:45.360
let's say it's the
amount of stress

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.000
you put in versus the strain.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.800
It could be quite low.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:50.550
And it would not be
very strong because it

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:54.690
didn't take a lot of energy
or stress to get it moving.

00:47:54.690 --> 00:47:56.340
Let's look at another ball.

00:47:56.340 --> 00:48:00.210
In this case, a
steel ball bearing.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.262
What do you guys think
is going to happen here?

00:48:02.262 --> 00:48:03.990
AUDIENCE: It's going to shatter.

00:48:03.990 --> 00:48:05.365
PROFESSOR: It's
going to shatter.

00:48:05.365 --> 00:48:09.010
So you're guessing that the
steel is brittle, right?

00:48:09.010 --> 00:48:09.550
What else?

00:48:16.538 --> 00:48:18.330
AUDIENCE: Probably
pretty stiff and strong.

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:21.220
PROFESSOR: Probably quite
stiff and strong, yeah.

00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:22.970
I think so, too, but
I don't think the guy

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:24.789
that did this expected that.

00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:50.918
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:50.918 --> 00:48:51.585
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:48:51.585 --> 00:48:53.498
Did that surprise anybody?

00:49:23.770 --> 00:49:24.270
Yeah.

00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:25.800
Quite a surprise, right?

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:28.290
So in this case, materials
like hardened steel

00:49:28.290 --> 00:49:30.000
aren't necessarily that brittle.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:33.480
In fact, you wouldn't want a
ball bearing to be brittle.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.380
If you get some small chip in it
or a little bit of grit or sand

00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:39.780
in the bearings, you would
shatter the ball bearing

00:49:39.780 --> 00:49:43.020
and cause instantaneous failure
of the rotating component.

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:46.140
So what you actually want out
of a high-strength ball bearing

00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.700
is something that's
extremely hard.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:50.730
Resists deformation
so it doesn't undergo,

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:53.100
let's say, change of shape
that would prevent it

00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.032
from rolling without friction
or with very little friction.

00:49:56.032 --> 00:49:57.990
You want it to be quite
stiff because you don't

00:49:57.990 --> 00:50:01.230
want the load of whatever you're
loading onto it to deform it,

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:03.780
but you also don't
want it to be brittle.

00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:06.960
So it's got to be somewhat
tough and ductile to prevent

00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.160
sudden failure.

00:50:08.160 --> 00:50:12.320
You'd rather it compress a tiny
bit than just cracking in half.

00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:15.550
So you can make things like
ceramic ball bearings, which

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:20.530
are very brittle, very stiff,
not that tough, but also very

00:50:20.530 --> 00:50:22.930
strong, and you just
have to make sure

00:50:22.930 --> 00:50:24.400
that whatever part
you make is not

00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:29.620
going to reach any sort of yield
strength criterion or crack

00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.410
or anything.

00:50:31.410 --> 00:50:34.890
Now the last one that's
probably the most surprising.

00:50:34.890 --> 00:50:38.130
They bought a $4,000 diamond.

00:50:38.130 --> 00:50:40.270
It's a diamond like that big.

00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:42.610
What do you know about
diamonds as a material in terms

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:43.690
of these properties?

00:50:43.690 --> 00:50:45.650
AUDIENCE: They're hard.

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:46.900
PROFESSOR: Yep, both is right.

00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:48.610
They're extremely stiff.

00:50:48.610 --> 00:50:51.460
It's the hardest material
that we know of, almost.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:53.815
We've made slightly
harder ones artificially.

00:50:53.815 --> 00:50:55.690
It's the hardest natural
material we know of.

00:50:55.690 --> 00:50:57.070
What else?

00:50:57.070 --> 00:50:59.756
Do you know whether
they're strong or tough?

00:50:59.756 --> 00:51:01.040
AUDIENCE: They're not tough.

00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:02.248
PROFESSOR: They're not tough.

00:51:02.248 --> 00:51:03.352
Why do you say that?

00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:05.420
AUDIENCE: Because
it will shatter.

00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:06.200
PROFESSOR: Have
you seen the video?

00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:06.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:07.810
PROFESSOR: Oh wow.

00:51:07.810 --> 00:51:09.260
OK.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:10.160
What else do we have?

00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.000
Yeah.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.597
So you're saying it's not tough.

00:51:12.597 --> 00:51:14.180
AUDIENCE: You can
cut diamonds, right?

00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:17.000
PROFESSOR: You can cut
diamonds with other diamonds.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.800
So the cutting action
usually depends

00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:21.810
on the relative hardness
of the material.

00:51:21.810 --> 00:51:24.680
So if you want to polish or
cut something abrasively,

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:26.210
you need to use
a harder material

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:29.180
because then the grit
itself won't wear away

00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.420
before the material
it's trying to cut.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.700
But what's going to happen here
is we're going to put a diamond

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.687
and try compressing
it, and we'll

00:51:36.687 --> 00:51:38.520
see what its stress-strain
curve looks like.

00:51:38.520 --> 00:51:40.460
So votes on what's
going to happen.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:43.541
Who says, like Monica,
it's going to shatter?

00:51:43.541 --> 00:51:47.340
Who thinks it's going
to break the tools?

00:51:47.340 --> 00:51:49.804
Who thinks it's going
to deform plastically?

00:51:49.804 --> 00:51:52.765
Yeah, I've never seen a
diamond deform plastically.

00:52:45.133 --> 00:52:47.300
AUDIENCE: They still have
pretty big chunks, though.

00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.040
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah, they could
probably still sell those.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.250
Absolutely no deformation.

00:52:53.250 --> 00:52:56.410
It just rotates and explodes.

00:52:56.410 --> 00:52:56.910
Yeah.

00:52:56.910 --> 00:52:58.620
This would be a
material that we would

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.220
say has almost zero ductility.

00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:04.320
Despite being
extremely hard, I don't

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:05.820
know if there would
even been enough

00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:08.918
deformation to have a slight
dent in the tool itself.

00:53:08.918 --> 00:53:11.460
There's probably a little hole
where the point of the diamond

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.030
poked in, but once there was
enough stress on that diamond,

00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:19.280
its stress-strain curve would
look something like that.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.480
Maybe like that.

00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:22.910
Yeah.

00:53:22.910 --> 00:53:24.530
So it's important
that you intuitively

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:27.920
understand the differences
between strength, ductility,

00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.490
hardness, toughness, and
stiffness, because then

00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:35.870
next class, we can explain
how radiation changes them.

00:53:35.870 --> 00:53:38.570
So any questions on the
materials and properties

00:53:38.570 --> 00:53:39.110
from today?

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:44.720
Yeah?

00:53:44.720 --> 00:53:47.790
AUDIENCE: Can you clarify why
something is, for example,

00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:49.705
ductile versus brittle?

00:53:49.705 --> 00:53:50.330
PROFESSOR: Mhm.

00:53:50.330 --> 00:53:51.997
So the reason something
would be ductile

00:53:51.997 --> 00:53:55.442
versus brittle is whether or not
you can plastically deform it,

00:53:55.442 --> 00:53:57.650
and that means whether or
not it's more energetically

00:53:57.650 --> 00:54:00.200
favorable for dislocations
to keep moving

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:03.890
versus just breaking a plane
of atoms in any irregular

00:54:03.890 --> 00:54:06.110
direction and causing fracture.

00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:08.480
So again, ductility
versus embrittlement

00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:13.670
is the interplay between
slip and fracture.

00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:16.670
Slip is normally done
by dislocation movement.

00:54:16.670 --> 00:54:20.120
Any defects created by anything,
especially radiation damage,

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.690
will make slip harder so that
any continued energy you put in

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:26.628
will not move dislocations
but move towards fracture.

00:54:29.496 --> 00:54:32.020
If there's no other
questions, we'll

00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.420
look at the
stress-strain curves of

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.743
some other familiar materials.

00:54:36.743 --> 00:54:39.160
It is 10:00, in case you guys
have to go to other classes.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.880
AUDIENCE: Are you taking any
nuclear activation stuff today?

00:54:45.880 --> 00:54:46.505
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:54:46.505 --> 00:54:48.940
If you guys have things for a
nuclear activation analysis,

00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:50.720
hand it in.

00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.663
You guys bring stuff in?

00:54:53.663 --> 00:54:55.580
We're running out of
opportunities to do this.

00:54:58.260 --> 00:54:58.760
All right.

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:03.260
In that case, the
entry fee for the quiz

00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:06.790
will be your nuclear
activation analysis sample.

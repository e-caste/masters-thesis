00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:22.130
ROBERT FIELD: All right.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:30.990
So last time, I said
that atomic sizes

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.090
are interesting or useful to
keep in mind, because you want

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.960
numbers for them, which are
somewhere between 0.1 and 100,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.790
or something like that.

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.916
Because then you have a sense
for how big everything is,

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.290
and you're in the
right ballpark.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.860
If you have to remember
a number and an exponent,

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.510
it's a little trickier.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.720
And so I'm going to say
something about atomic sizes

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:03.450
in just a few minutes, but the
main things from the previous

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.050
lecture were this relationship
between the wavelength

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:13.150
and the momentum, which is true
for both waves and particles,

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.820
or things that we think
are wave-like, like light,

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.300
and things that we think are
particle-like, like electrons--

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.940
and so this unifying principle.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.440
Then I have a little question.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.540
And that is suppose the
wavelength for a particle

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.400
is known, and suppose
we have n particles.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.540
And so if we say each particle
requires a volume of lambda

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.980
cubed, and there
are n particles,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.820
and we stick them into a
volume smaller than n times

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.970
lambda cubed, what's
going to happen?

00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:55.130
Yes?

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.430
AUDIENCE: They interfere
with the structure?

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.130
ROBERT FIELD: Their
identities get corrupted,

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.580
and the person who does
that for the first time

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.240
gets a Nobel Prize, and
that was Wolfgang Ketterle--

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.229
and others.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.190
So when you have quantum
mechanical particles

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.920
that are too close
together, they

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.870
lose their individual identity.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.810
And so this is a
very simple thing

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.410
that anybody who was beginning
to understand quantum

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.770
mechanics in the
1920s would say,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.740
this is a puzzling thing, maybe
we should think about that.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.600
And it's really hard,
so it took a long time.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.980
Then a whole bunch of
experiments led to the idea

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:47.210
that we need to have a way for
atoms to fill space and satisfy

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.640
all of the other stuff, and that
was Rutherford's planetary atom

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.010
picture.

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.310
The problem with that
is it does fill space,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.850
but there's no way
for the electron

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.900
to continue orbiting around
a nucleus, because it

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.890
will radiate its energy, and
fall into the nucleus, and game

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.060
over.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.980
And so Bohr and De Broglie
both had ways of fixing this.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:24.260
And Bohr's way was simply to
say the angular momentum is not

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.760
just conserved, but it
has certain values--

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.700
an integer times h bar,
h bar is h over 2 pi.

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.030
And De Broglie said in
order to keep the electron

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.210
from annihilating itself,
since it's going around

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:46.470
in a circular orbit of
known circumference,

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.870
there must be an integer
number of wavelengths

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.710
around that orbit.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.680
Now, that's a much more
physical and reasonable ad

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.200
hoc explanation, but
it's still ad hoc.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.980
It assumes that
the particles are

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.560
moving around circular orbits.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.610
I hinted that the
way out of this

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.140
is going to be that the
particles aren't moving.

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.990
Then we could still
have angular momentum.

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:20.399
We can still have all
sorts of useful stuff,

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.340
but they're not moving,
and we don't radiate

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.290
the energy of the particles.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.990
But that requires a
completely new way

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.190
of looking at particles
in quantum mechanics.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.360
But the thing about both the
Bohr hypothesis and the De

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.350
Broglie hypothesis is
that any sophomore who

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.530
made such a proposal
would be laughed

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.980
at in the 1910-1920 period,
because it's just ridiculous.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:04.320
But the reason these hypotheses
were taken seriously is that

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.250
this planetary model with those
corrections explain the spectra

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.040
of all one-electron systems--

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.130
hydrogen, helium plus,
lithium two plus,

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.580
uranium 91 plus, all
of them, to better

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.860
than measurement
accuracy at the time,

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:25.710
and better than measurement
accuracy for a long time

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.410
after this was proposed.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.540
So getting a whole bunch--

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:32.980
now, a whole bunch is an
infinite number, actually--

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.880
of 10 digit numbers makes you
think there's something here,

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:43.710
but nobody knows where
here is except the numbers.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.080
And the idea of the planetary
model with the fixes

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.610
doesn't explain anything other
than the spectral lines, which

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.350
is a lot, but it tells you
there's something really good

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.090
there.

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.700
I guess one thing I forgot
to mention in the summary

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:11.780
is that the energy levels that
you get from the Bohr model

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.560
are going to explain
spectra if you

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:20.675
say a spectrum are transitions
between these energy levels.

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.120
And that was also a
brilliant suggestion,

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:29.390
and it was suggested
by numerology.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:34.610
But let us go back to work now.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:37.800
We're going to talk about
the two-slit experiment.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.840
And I have a personal
thing to report about that.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.720
The first time I
gave a talk, it was

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.990
going to be a 15-minute talk
at a spectroscopy conference,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.540
and so I did a
practice talk, and it

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.140
had to do with the two-slit
experiment in relationship

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:57.910
to spectroscopy.

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.990
But I did a practice talk,
and it took two hours.

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:08.830
So I have a thing about
the two-slit experiment.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:13.450
And I think this lecture is
going to be not two hours.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:15.400
It's going to be on time.

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.980
So we're going to talk about
the two-slit experiment,

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.340
and the important thing
about the two-slit experiment

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.090
is that it's mostly
ordinary wave interference.

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:31.180
There is no quantum mechanics,
and so most of the hard stuff

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.690
to analyze is classical physics.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:38.950
And I'm going to do the
best I can with that.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:44.440
But after we get to
understanding this problem,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.630
there will be a surprise
at the end, which

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.420
is a quantum surprise.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:52.950
And it's something that
absolutely requires

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:55.930
a postulate, the first
postulate of quantum mechanics,

00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.550
some idea of what we
are talking about here.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:01.390
What are we allowed to
know about a system?

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:06.130
And it tells you
there's something there.

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:10.630
And then I'm going to give you a
little description of something

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:14.890
which I think I have to
call a semi-classical optics

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.710
uncertainty principle.

00:08:16.710 --> 00:08:21.430
Semi-classical or semi-anything
is usually quantum mechanics,

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.830
just a little bit,
mixed into something

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:26.930
that was well understood
before, or that

00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:29.210
is very convenient
to use, and you only

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.670
bring in quantum mechanics
when you have to.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:34.280
And it's the easiest
thing to understand.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.840
And that introduces the
uncertainty principle,

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:45.350
and we get a taste of the first
of several quantum mechanical

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:48.470
postulates.

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.270
So let's start with the sizes.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.540
I should have given you these
sizes in the previous lecture,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.630
but I was being
mostly number-free.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:07.730
So the radius of a Bohr
orbit is given by n

00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:17.450
over z squared, where z is the
integer charge on the nucleus,

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:24.670
times 0.5292 angstroms.

00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:30.430
So half an angstrom is the
radius of, basically, any atom.

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:34.780
And this charge on the
nucleus, it gets smaller.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:37.630
And this is a very useful thing.

00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:53.740
The wavelength is given by n
over z times 3.32 angstroms.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:10:01.090
And that's the
situation where n times

00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:06.810
the wavelength is
equal to 2 pi rn.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.100
So we have n wavelengths
around an orbit,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:14.880
and this is really the
De Broglie hypothesis.

00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:18.630
But again, something which
is on the order of something

00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:20.490
that you can remember.

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:21.750
And the energy levels--

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:42.630
these energy levels are z
squared times 13.6 electron

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.820
volts over n squared.

00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:51.960
If we were talking about
energies in joules,

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.560
or in any units you want, it's
likely to have a big exponent.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:59.749
But this one is
in electron volts,

00:10:59.749 --> 00:11:01.290
and that's actually
what's happening.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:05.430
An electron is being
attracted to a positive thing,

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.670
and there's, basically,
a voltage difference.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:10.650
And so that's
another useful thing.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:11.580
Now this z--

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:20.070
I left out the Rydberg.

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:23.820
This Rydberg constant--
there's a bunch

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.300
of fundamental constants, and
since I'm a spectroscopist,

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.520
I think in terms
of wave numbers,

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:31.500
reciprocal centimeters.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:35.190
And for me, that's energy, it's
frequency, it's everything,

00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:48.420
but anyway, for hydrogen,
it's 1097677.581.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:53.340
For something with an
infinite mass nucleus,

00:11:53.340 --> 00:12:01.580
it's 109737.3153
reciprocal centimeters.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:04.440
And this is the number
that I have in my head,

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.140
and I use it in all
sorts of places,

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.450
and you can imagine where.

00:12:09.450 --> 00:12:16.300
And to get to any
particular nucleus,

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:22.860
this is just r infinity
mu nucleus, or mu atom,

00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.510
over the mass of the electron.

00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:31.110
And it turns out that almost
everything except hydrogen

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:33.640
is very close to this number.

00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.700
And so this hardly
matters, but it

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:40.755
does give you a little bit of
dependence on the nuclear mass.

00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:48.690
So I said before that
this Rydberg equation,

00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:54.550
or this equation,
tells you nothing.

00:12:54.550 --> 00:12:58.820
It tells you where all
the energy levels are,

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:02.240
and anyone could tell
you where the rest are.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.200
So it's a pattern,
which is nice,

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:11.850
but a pattern which says
if things are well-behaved,

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:16.200
like hydrogen atom, this is
what the energy levels will be.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:20.790
But life is difficult.
Life is not with everything

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.060
well-behaved, and so
this is a pattern which

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.120
says I'm interested in
how the real life is

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.370
different from that pattern.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:32.070
It's a way of thinking
about structure

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.260
and how we learn
about structure.

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:38.880
Information about the details
of a molecule or an atom

00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.290
is encoded in the spectrum,
and this is the magic decoder,

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.660
or one of the magic
decoders, we use

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:50.100
to begin to assemble
the new insights.

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.410
This doesn't appear
in textbooks.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.860
In textbooks, you get the
equations, you get the truth,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.040
and you don't get any
strange interpretations.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.816
That's what you're
getting from me.

00:14:01.816 --> 00:14:03.440
You're getting strange
interpretations,

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.370
and you'll have them
throughout the course.

00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.740
So now what we
want to do is talk

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:12.249
about the two-split experiment.

00:14:23.330 --> 00:14:25.860
Let's just begin.

00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:28.270
So here's a diagram.

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:30.870
And here we have
a source of light.

00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:36.710
It's a light bulb in your notes.

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:38.450
It's a candle here.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:48.250
And then we have two
slits, and the slits

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:50.590
are separated by distance d.

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:02.410
And so this is the first slit,
s1, and the second slit, s2.

00:15:02.410 --> 00:15:07.600
And the distance between
them is much larger

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:08.860
than the width of each slit.

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:15.880
And now we go down
to the screen.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:28.700
And the distance from the
slits to the screen is l,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.314
and l is much,
much larger than d.

00:15:33.314 --> 00:15:34.730
This means, of
course, we're going

00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:37.460
to be using small-angle
approximation

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:41.390
and simple solutions, because
everything is much larger

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:42.900
than something else.

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.080
And that's very convenient.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.850
Now I want to just put on axes.

00:15:48.850 --> 00:15:55.880
So this is the x-axis, and
this is 0, and this is l.

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:57.900
And now the screen--

00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:00.140
we're going to see
something on the screen that

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.800
looks like this.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:07.170
I'm giving it away.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:14.910
And the distance here is
0, and the distance here

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.180
is the z-axis.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:20.760
So the distance to this
slit is on the x-axis,

00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:27.230
and the pattern, the diffraction
pattern, is on the z-axis.

00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:30.520
And this 0 is right in
the middle of the pattern.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.530
It would correspond to this
point, the midpoint here.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:38.630
So what we want
to do is calculate

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.880
what's going to
appear on the screen,

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.460
and I've already given it away.

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:52.924
What you see is a bunch of
equally-spaced intensity maxima

00:16:52.924 --> 00:16:54.590
where we have
constructive interference.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:58.340
And in between, we have less
constructive interference--

00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:03.160
or destructive interference,
and we want to understand that.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.290
Now this is optics.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:06.930
This is no quantum
mechanics at all.

00:17:16.220 --> 00:17:20.099
Let's look at this
in more detail.

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:31.600
So we have the
z-axis, horizontal,

00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:40.140
and we have a path
to the screen,

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.920
and another path to the screen.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:48.310
So what we're interested
in is here's one slit,

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:54.650
here's the other slit, and
we have two parallel lines

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.010
that meet at infinity, which
is where the screen is--

00:17:58.010 --> 00:18:00.230
and what we're going
to be interested in

00:18:00.230 --> 00:18:07.200
is what is the path difference
between this one and this one.

00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:13.500
So we have an angle which is
given by the perpendicular

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.890
to this right.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.860
So this distance is d.

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.510
This distance is
L. And this angle

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.970
is theta, as is this angle.

00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.680
And what we're
interested in is this--

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:41.350
the extra path traveled
by the lower slit.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:44.480
So we use trigonometry,
and we can figure that out.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.770
And so delta is the
path difference.

00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:56.330
Delta is equal to d sine theta.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:04.340
And in order for it to be
constructive interference,

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.690
we have to have this path
difference to be an integer

00:19:08.690 --> 00:19:12.410
number of wavelengths.

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.810
Now this is optics,
and so that's something

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.080
that we don't need
quantum mechanics for.

00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:23.370
We know we're going
to get interference.

00:19:23.370 --> 00:19:28.190
So we can now solve for where
the constructive interference

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:30.000
occurs.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.920
And so we have theta n is
equal to the inverse sine of n

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.230
lambda over d.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.170
But this is a small angle,
even though I drew it

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.240
not as a small angle.

00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:55.280
And so we can replace sine x
by x or inverse of sine y by y.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:00.380
And anyway, we can
say that the angles

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:06.300
for constructive interference
are given by n lambda over d.

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.620
So we've derived the
diffraction equation.

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.740
We've solved.

00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:21.240
And now what we want to know
is where do the spots occur.

00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:25.830
They occur at z equals 0,
z equals plus or minus l

00:20:25.830 --> 00:20:30.310
sine theta, which is
approximately equal

00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:34.650
to l over d n lambda.

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:43.560
So we have l times lambda
over d times an integer.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.730
So what we're going
to see on the screen

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:55.740
is a series of bright lines
for constructive interference--

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:59.730
and they're not lines.

00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:01.510
It's a curve.

00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:06.035
But we can measure the
maximum of the intensity,

00:21:06.035 --> 00:21:07.410
and we can say
they're like this,

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.880
and they're equally spaced.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.990
And they tell us things we knew.

00:21:12.990 --> 00:21:13.710
We knew l.

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:14.271
We knew d.

00:21:14.271 --> 00:21:14.895
We knew lambda.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.080
So there's nothing surprising.

00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:22.085
This is just optics.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:34.004
So now suppose we go in
and we cover one slit.

00:21:34.004 --> 00:21:34.545
What happens?

00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:39.425
Yes?

00:21:39.425 --> 00:21:40.910
AUDIENCE: The
interference stops?

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:43.410
ROBERT FIELD: The
interference goes away.

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:49.650
And you could imagine that
there would be a little sign.

00:21:49.650 --> 00:21:52.200
If you covered the
top slit, the pattern

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.170
would be skewed a little
bit in the direction

00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.640
of the bottom slit.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.920
And so there'll be a
little bit of asymmetry,

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.150
but you could
actually know which

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:07.590
slit your colleague covered.

00:22:07.590 --> 00:22:11.270
So if both slits are open,
you have interference.

00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:15.372
If one slit is covered,
you have no interference.

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:28.030
We're getting into the
realm of quantum mechanics.

00:22:28.030 --> 00:22:32.670
In quantum mechanics, one of
the things we do is we say,

00:22:32.670 --> 00:22:35.240
suppose we did a
perfect experiment.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.700
Maybe it's an experiment
that's beyond what you're

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:41.490
capable of doing with
the present technology,

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:47.970
but you can say, I could
measure positions in time

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:53.550
as accurately as I
want, and one could also

00:22:53.550 --> 00:22:58.980
say that I could do this an
infinite number of times.

00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:04.130
I could do the same experiment
an infinite number of times.

00:23:04.130 --> 00:23:07.364
Without quantum mechanics, if
you did the same experiment

00:23:07.364 --> 00:23:08.780
an infinite number
of times, you'd

00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:12.437
get the same answer an
infinite number of times.

00:23:12.437 --> 00:23:14.770
But with quantum mechanics,
you're going to discover you

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:17.200
don't.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.730
It's probabilistic,
not deterministic.

00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:26.130
And under certain conditions,
the range over which you have

00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:27.870
a finite probability
is very small,

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:33.120
and it looks deterministic,
but it isn't.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:39.840
The perfect experiment business
is an interesting hypothesis,

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:44.250
but you can imagine
defining what

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.130
is perfect in terms of
what is intrinsically

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:49.865
possible to achieve, even if
it's not currently possible.

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:15.300
So what we want to do is
decrease the intensity

00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:18.840
of the light that's
going into the apparatus,

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:26.730
so that there is never more than
one photon in the apparatus.

00:24:26.730 --> 00:24:30.010
Never is a strong word,
and we could never do that,

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:31.170
and so that's not legal.

00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:37.690
But we can say, suppose
we decrease the intensity

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.790
so that for the time
it takes for the photon

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:45.090
to go from the slit to
the screen, which we know

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:48.930
because we know
the speed of light,

00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:51.960
and for the intensity of the
light, which we can measure

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:57.780
with an energy meter, we can say
the probability of there being

00:24:57.780 --> 00:25:03.800
more than one photon at a time
in the apparatus is small, as

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.630
small as we want, but not zero.

00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.890
And so then we do
the experiment.

00:25:11.890 --> 00:25:26.780
And what we discover when we
do the experiment is instead

00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:34.280
of having a uniform intensity
or some kind of continuously

00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:37.940
varying intensity on
the detector screen,

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:40.510
we get a series of dots--

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.100
events.

00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.170
The photon went
in, and the photon

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.660
was a wave when it went in.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:56.370
There was interference,
maybe, and the photon

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:59.600
died on this detector screen.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.350
This is an example of
destructive detection, which

00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:05.470
is something that is very
important in quantum mechanics,

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:13.160
because in quantum mechanics,
most measurements destroy

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.270
the system, or destroy the
state that the system was

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:23.010
in during the experiment.

00:26:23.010 --> 00:26:26.210
So this business of what
is the state of the system

00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.720
is a really important
quantum mechanical concept,

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.430
which you don't normally
encounter in classic mechanics.

00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:40.920
We send photons one at a
time through the apparatus,

00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.160
and we get something like this.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:47.090
And we get something like this
whether both slits are opened

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.230
or one slit is covered.

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:55.600
So we do this, and we
do this for a long time,

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:02.300
and what we see is we
see a lot of events,

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:05.000
and they're starting
to arrange themselves

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.100
where the interference
fringes were supposed to be.

00:27:09.100 --> 00:27:13.900
So this pattern only
emerges after you'd

00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:21.020
allow a large number of photons
to go into the apparatus.

00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:24.450
There is no way classical
optics gives you that.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.050
And so if one slit
is covered, you

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:35.580
get a uniform
distribution of dots.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:39.330
If both slits are open, you get
this kind of a distribution.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:53.150
I'm going to ask
you to vote on this.

00:27:53.150 --> 00:27:55.570
So we do the experiment--

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:57.340
and I've sort of
given away the answer,

00:27:57.340 --> 00:28:00.040
but I still want
you to vote on this.

00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.350
What are the possible things?

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.460
So we know there's
only one photon

00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.300
in the apparatus at a time.

00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:21.150
Our concept of interference is
light interference with itself.

00:28:21.150 --> 00:28:25.310
And this is a possibility
that says, I think I know.

00:28:25.310 --> 00:28:32.990
And here is another,
weak interference

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:40.302
on top of constant background.

00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.060
This would reflect.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:47.280
Even though we
decided that we would

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.220
have one photon
in the apparatus,

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.520
occasionally there are two.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.310
And when there's two, there
could be interference,

00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:58.940
and so we'd have some weak
interference superimposed

00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:03.472
on the constant background.

00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:18.620
Now we get this 100% modulated
interference structure.

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:20.510
And the last thing
is something else.

00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:34.210
You have to transport yourself
back in time to around 1910.

00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:37.410
You haven't heard
this lecture, but you

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:39.450
do know what the experiment is.

00:29:39.450 --> 00:29:43.380
And so what would you expect?

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:50.040
First, no interference,
raise your hand.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.180
I've got one-- two--

00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.490
I've got a few votes
for no interference.

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:57.640
In 1910, that's what
you would have said.

00:29:57.640 --> 00:30:01.751
Weak interference on top
of constant background--

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:10.110
that would be when you're
hedging your bets and saying,

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.010
the experiment,
it isn't perfect,

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:14.230
and this is really
the right answer,

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:17.160
but if someone was a little
sloppy, I'd get this.

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.780
Raise your hands for this one.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:30.270
What would you
have said in 1910?

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:33.330
I got nobody with the
courage to say this.

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:35.340
You would have
gotten a Nobel Prize

00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:38.680
if you could have defended it.

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.260
Something else-- maybe something
else-- maybe the photons

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:47.500
come in pairs or
something ridiculous.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:52.950
So the correct answer
is 100% modulated.

00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:57.010
What people would have
said in 1910 is this.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:00.910
Some curmudgeons, like the
climate change deniers,

00:31:00.910 --> 00:31:03.570
would have said there is a
little bit of this or maybe

00:31:03.570 --> 00:31:06.010
that, but I can't
possibly accept

00:31:06.010 --> 00:31:07.330
that, which is the truth.

00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:12.915
We won't belabor that anymore.

00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:20.850
This means that one photon
can interfere with itself.

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:24.500
It's a very disturbing
idea, but it

00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:30.590
leads to a critical idea
in quantum mechanics.

00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.960
In quantum mechanics,
the state of the system

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:39.230
is described by some
state function, which is

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.970
a function of position in time.

00:31:41.970 --> 00:31:46.400
And so what happens
is you prepare

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.070
the system in some state.

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.930
You do something
to it, like force

00:31:50.930 --> 00:31:55.920
it to go through two slits.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.545
Then we get some
new state function.

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:04.570
And then we detect it,
and we get something else.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:09.700
So the actual experiment is
a click, the preparation,

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:11.950
and the click, detection.

00:32:11.950 --> 00:32:16.060
And somehow, what is the
nature of the experiment

00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:19.900
is expressed on this
initial state of the system.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:26.540
This is all very abstract,
but it's about interference.

00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:31.810
So this guy had
better have phase.

00:32:31.810 --> 00:32:37.780
So we have a wave that can
constructively or destructively

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.295
interfere with itself.

00:32:42.190 --> 00:32:54.020
And so we start talking
about things like amplitude,

00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.540
but the crucial
word is amplitude.

00:32:56.540 --> 00:32:59.210
And mostly, when
we detect things,

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:00.650
we're detecting probability.

00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:07.830
This is always positive.

00:33:07.830 --> 00:33:11.160
These guys can be
positive and negative.

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:14.330
This is essential for
quantum mechanics.

00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:18.050
It's essential for understanding
the two-slit experiment,

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:22.055
but we have to do an awful lot
more to make all this concrete.

00:33:35.539 --> 00:33:37.580
Why don't we look at the
classical wave equation?

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:47.920
Actually, we'll look at
the classical wave equation

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:51.390
next time, but I will say
that the solution to the wave

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:55.380
equation is some
function of x and t,

00:33:55.380 --> 00:34:02.670
which has the form a
sine kx minus omega t.

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.560
So I'm doing this
to introduce you

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:09.510
to the crucial actors in this
game, which is amplitude,

00:34:09.510 --> 00:34:11.969
wave number, and frequency.

00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:19.900
And this is a
probability amplitude.

00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.760
It can have either sine, because
you can see the sine function.

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:30.909
So this is a wave of
frequency omega propagating

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:34.210
in the plus x direction.

00:34:34.210 --> 00:34:40.670
Now let's just identify
the crucial quantity.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.070
Wavelength is the
repeat distance.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:51.110
So that if we said
we have u of x and t,

00:34:51.110 --> 00:34:57.590
it has to be equal to u
of x plus lambda and t.

00:34:57.590 --> 00:35:00.000
So that's how we
define the wavelength.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.310
And we discover
that the wavelength

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:09.350
has to be related to k times
lambda is equal to 2 pi.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.220
Because this part has to
change by 2 pi in order

00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:19.950
for there to be an exact
replica of what we had before.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:22.910
So we know that the wavelength
is the repeat distance,

00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:28.740
and k is 2 pi over lambda.

00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.310
It's called wave
number, and it's

00:35:31.310 --> 00:35:36.170
the number of waves,
complete waves, that occur

00:35:36.170 --> 00:35:39.050
in 2 pi times the unit length.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.030
Now, in 3D, we have a vector
as opposed to a number.

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:52.240
And that points in the direction
of propagation of the wave.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.770
We know from quantum mechanics--

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:04.330
or from the experiments--

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:11.800
that the wavelength is
related to the momentum.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:17.290
There's several reasons
for this for waves.

00:36:17.290 --> 00:36:19.120
This could still
be optics, but it

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.310
could have been
relativistic optics,

00:36:21.310 --> 00:36:28.820
because Einstein proposed
that the momentum is e over c.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:35.200
So we put that together,
and we get the relationship

00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:38.830
between k and momentum.

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:48.130
Now h bar is h over 2 pi.

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:54.460
And so the wave number is
large if the momentum is large,

00:36:54.460 --> 00:36:57.430
and the wavelength is small
if the momentum is large.

00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:03.780
Now what about the velocity?

00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.930
So we have a wave.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:10.700
Let's sit on this
wave here and say,

00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:17.690
we're now sitting on some point
where the phase is constant.

00:37:17.690 --> 00:37:23.270
I like to call this the
stationary phase point,

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:25.940
but that has other
meanings, so you just

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.500
have to be careful with this.

00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.250
So we want to know how
fast this moves in space.

00:37:31.250 --> 00:37:39.110
And so we say, the phase is the
phase of this function here,

00:37:39.110 --> 00:37:40.670
and so it's k x--

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:43.620
I'll put a little phi on this--

00:37:43.620 --> 00:37:46.160
minus omega t.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:49.100
And we want to
find how this moves

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.410
in time, this stationary phase.

00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:54.710
We could choose this to be zero.

00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:56.450
We could choose a phase.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:59.202
This is zero, this
is some maximum,

00:37:59.202 --> 00:38:00.660
but we can choose
anything we want.

00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:01.970
So let's make it zero.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:06.680
And so then we can solve for
x phi is a function of t,

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:14.060
and that's omega t over k.

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.160
We want the phase velocity,
the velocity of this wave.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.700
So we take the derivative
with respect to t.

00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:34.160
And so the velocity,
which we'll call c,

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.800
is equal to omega over k.

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:43.970
That's true for light
traveling in a vacuum.

00:38:43.970 --> 00:38:46.750
This is called the
dispersion relation.

00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:51.760
Whenever you do a calculation
of waves in material,

00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.910
the goal is to get the
dispersion relation.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:39:00.190
This is the simplest possible
one, because it says everybody

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:03.220
at the same frequency--

00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:09.180
I'm sorry-- that there is a
relationship between omega

00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:13.360
and k so that everybody
travels with the same speed.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.649
If that didn't happen,
the waves would get out

00:39:15.649 --> 00:39:16.690
of phase with each other.

00:39:16.690 --> 00:39:19.510
That's what's dispersion is.

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:24.980
So we have from simple optics,
basically, everything we need.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:31.210
And now, the last thing is
that the intensity of this wave

00:39:31.210 --> 00:39:54.250
is given by kkix
minus omega i t.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:59.000
So this is the wave function.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:03.340
It's something that has sines.

00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:06.850
And this is the
intensity, which is

00:40:06.850 --> 00:40:08.950
proportional to this quantity.

00:40:08.950 --> 00:40:13.570
We sum the amplitudes
and then square.

00:40:13.570 --> 00:40:17.080
We do this in quantum
mechanics all the time.

00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.780
And this is like quantum
mechanics in the sense

00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:22.720
that we have our fundamental
building block, which

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.640
is something with phase.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:26.500
And the relationship
of the thing

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.970
with phase to the thing
which is probability

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:34.290
is sum of the square.

00:40:34.290 --> 00:40:34.980
Yes?

00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.721
AUDIENCE: What's the first
character after the capital

00:40:37.721 --> 00:40:38.220
sigma?

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:39.220
ROBERT FIELD: I'm sorry?

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.440
AUDIENCE: The first character
after the sum there?

00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:43.420
ROBERT FIELD: This?

00:40:43.420 --> 00:40:44.150
No, this.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:45.750
That's a constant.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:51.750
That's the amplitude of that
particular frequency and wave

00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:53.790
vector.

00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:55.590
I'm sorry about the
mess on the board.

00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:00.600
We have enough time.

00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.860
Oh, good.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.650
So this is sort of a
taste of what you're

00:41:04.650 --> 00:41:09.060
going to be doing,
but now let's produce

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:18.961
a form of the
uncertainty principle.

00:41:32.380 --> 00:41:35.170
You've heard about the
uncertainty principle,

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:39.420
and it's a very important
part of quantum mechanics,

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.970
but it's also something
that you can have in optics.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:49.160
And so again, we resort
to this simple idea

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:57.010
of sending a particle
through a slit

00:41:57.010 --> 00:42:01.140
and looking at what
happens over here.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:04.322
Instead of having two
slits, we just have one.

00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:05.780
But there are two
important things.

00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:11.430
The two edges of this slit are
special, because they're edges.

00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:14.400
And so we can ask, what
about the interference

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:17.910
between particles
that was diffracted

00:42:17.910 --> 00:42:21.290
by this edge versus that edge.

00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:22.990
And the same thing goes.

00:42:22.990 --> 00:42:26.320
You get constructive
interference

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.300
when the difference
in path length

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:32.350
is an integer number of waves,
and destructive interference

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:38.990
when it's an odd integer
number of half waves.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:43.730
We're interested in the
destructive interference.

00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:49.080
So we analyze this in
exactly the same way

00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:51.520
we did the two-slit experiment.

00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:55.250
And now this is the z direction.

00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:56.938
And this is the x direction.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.920
And what you end up finding
is that the uncertainty

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.650
in the z direction
is going to be

00:43:05.650 --> 00:43:14.620
related 2 times lambda
over delta s over l.

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:27.480
Delta s is the width
of the slit, so width

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:32.200
of the image along the z-axis.

00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:37.500
So we have a maximum here, and
we have minima here and here,

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:48.030
and so this delta z is the
distance between minima.

00:43:48.030 --> 00:43:53.440
So we can say, between minima,
we have the particle localized.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.890
Its position in space--

00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:01.530
or the photon localized--
its position in space

00:44:01.530 --> 00:44:03.435
is uncertain by this quantity.

00:44:06.251 --> 00:44:07.250
What about its momentum?

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:16.396
And so now we just have to draw
a little bit of conservation

00:44:16.396 --> 00:44:16.895
of momentum.

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:33.010
So here we have the magnitude
of the momentum starting

00:44:33.010 --> 00:44:38.410
from the middle of the
slit, and this magnitude

00:44:38.410 --> 00:44:40.120
is constant along a circle--

00:44:43.690 --> 00:44:44.410
the magnitude.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:52.880
So if we do draw a line
here, this has got p.

00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:57.370
And if we ask the length
here, that's also p.

00:44:57.370 --> 00:44:59.060
But now what we
want to know is what

00:44:59.060 --> 00:45:03.271
is the uncertainty of the
momentum in the z direction--

00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:07.560
delta pz.

00:45:12.820 --> 00:45:16.080
This is the same sort of
calculation we did before,

00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:21.630
and what you find is
delta pz is approximately

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:29.790
equal to magnitude of
p lambda or delta s.

00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:35.370
And now we put in the
Bohr relationship here,

00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:39.650
and we get that
this is equal to h

00:45:39.650 --> 00:45:46.980
over lambda, lambda over the
ds, which is equal to h over ps.

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:56.490
Or ds in the z direction--

00:45:56.490 --> 00:45:58.200
no, ds is the slit width.

00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:07.630
I got something wrong
here in my notes.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:12.980
The final result
of this calculation

00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:22.280
is dz is dpz
approximately equal to h.

00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.870
Sorry about the glitch here.

00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.850
I don't know how to
fix it right now,

00:46:25.850 --> 00:46:29.450
but if this were
done correctly, we

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:31.580
would have gotten this result.

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.410
This is an
uncertainty principle.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:38.440
If you tried to measure
z and pz simultaneously

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.940
with classical optics, you still
would get something like this.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:48.790
Using the relationship
for momentum

00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:53.670
that lambda is equal h over
p, we've got to use that.

00:46:53.670 --> 00:46:55.450
But because of
that relationship,

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:57.250
we get this result.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:47:00.520
If you do a perfect experiment,
and you make the slit smaller

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.340
and smaller, you make the
uncertainty in the momentum

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.140
larger and larger.

00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:06.850
The best you can do is this.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:14.540
Now, this is actually a
reasonable and rigorous

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:20.140
derivation if I had
done it a little better.

00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:26.070
But I've never liked this
introduction to the uncertainty

00:47:26.070 --> 00:47:30.600
principle, because it says,
for the kind of experiment

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.270
we thought about, you
can't do better than this.

00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:36.260
Maybe there's a different
kind of experiment.

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:39.140
It's sort of an
artifactual as opposed

00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:41.810
to a physical derivation.

00:47:41.810 --> 00:47:42.870
We care.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:47.150
We will do a physical derivation
of the uncertainty principle.

00:47:47.150 --> 00:47:49.610
And it will have to do
with the ability of two

00:47:49.610 --> 00:47:52.360
operates to commute
with each other.

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.250
That's a purely
mathematical definition,

00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:03.870
but this is the first sign
of the uncertainty principle.

00:48:12.830 --> 00:48:15.200
At the end of your
notes, there is

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:22.130
a set of postulates from
which, essentially, all quantum

00:48:22.130 --> 00:48:24.210
mechanics can be derived.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:26.900
Now, there are different
sets of postulates proposed

00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:28.670
by different people,
but these are

00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:30.425
things that can't be proven.

00:48:30.425 --> 00:48:32.550
They are things that you
think is going to be true,

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:34.610
and then you look
at the consequences.

00:48:34.610 --> 00:48:37.550
The first postulate
says, the state

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:39.650
of a quantum mechanical
system is completely

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:43.520
specified by a function,
psi of r and t,

00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:47.030
that depends on the coordinates
of the particle and on time.

00:48:47.030 --> 00:48:51.380
This function, called the wave
function or the state function,

00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:55.730
has the important property
that this quantity

00:48:55.730 --> 00:49:01.220
times its complex conjugate
integrated over the volume

00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:04.880
element is the probability
that the particle lies

00:49:04.880 --> 00:49:10.500
in the volume element
centered at r at time t.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:14.460
So we are saying there
is a way, a complete way,

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.190
of describing the
state of the system.

00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:18.850
It's a function.

00:49:18.850 --> 00:49:23.670
It's not a bunch of
discrete quantities,

00:49:23.670 --> 00:49:25.950
like velocity and position.

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:28.560
And things are smeared out.

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.220
And what we want to do when
we want to calculate anything,

00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.460
we're going to be
using this function.

00:49:35.460 --> 00:49:39.350
And this function comes from
the Schrodinger equation.

00:49:39.350 --> 00:49:42.530
And we're going to get to
the Schrodinger equation--

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:43.860
not in the next lecture.

00:49:43.860 --> 00:49:46.760
I'm going to spend the next
lecture really laboring

00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:51.880
the wave equation, because the
Schrodinger equation is just

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.430
a tiny step beyond
the wave equation.

00:49:59.270 --> 00:50:02.060
I've given you the
five postulates.

00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.740
You have not a clue
what any of them

00:50:03.740 --> 00:50:07.450
mean, except maybe a little
bit about the first one.

00:50:07.450 --> 00:50:09.670
But what I don't want
to do is give a lecture

00:50:09.670 --> 00:50:11.770
on the postulates.

00:50:11.770 --> 00:50:15.610
I want to bring them into
action when you need them,

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:18.780
because they'll mean much more.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:22.150
And so you won't be asked
to memorize the postulates.

00:50:22.150 --> 00:50:25.930
You'll know when
they are applicable

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:28.880
and how to apply them.

00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:30.910
So it's a little
premature to say

00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:33.860
you understand the
first postulate,

00:50:33.860 --> 00:50:37.260
but that's what's at play here
in the two-slit experiment

00:50:37.260 --> 00:50:42.260
and in this hand waving
derivation of the uncertainty

00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:43.990
principle.

00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:51.460
So next time, we will
look at the wave equation.

00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:52.480
Thank you.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:54.430
Hey, I finished
on time this time.

00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:56.460
That's a bad sign.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.390
PROFESSOR: Today we're going
to continue our discussion

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.040
of methods of integration.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.560
The method that I'm
going to describe today

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.310
handles a whole
class of functions

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.510
of the following form.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:53.460
You take P(x) / Q(x) and this
is known as a rational function.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.810
And all that means
is that it's a ratio

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:09.680
of two polynomials, which are
these functions P(x) and Q(x).

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.380
We'll handle all such
functions by a method which

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:26.250
is known as partial fractions.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:36.190
And what this does is,
it splits P / Q into what

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:45.260
you could call easier pieces.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.571
So that's going to be
some kind of algebra.

00:01:47.571 --> 00:01:49.070
And that's what
we're going to spend

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.640
most of our time doing today.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.090
I'll start with an example.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.950
And all of my examples
will be illustrating

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.830
more general methods.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.200
The example is to integrate the
function 1 1/(x-1) plus, say,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.240
3/(x+2), dx.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.400
That's easy to do.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.410
It's just, we already
know the answer.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.170
It's ln x - ln(x-1) + 3 ln(x+3).

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.340
Plus a constant.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:37.050
So that's done.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:41.330
So now, here's the difficulty
that is going to arise.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.320
The difficulty is that I can
start with this function, which

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.210
is perfectly manageable.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.830
And than I can add these
two functions together.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.380
The way I add fractions.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.750
So that's getting a
common denominator.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.140
And so that gives me
x+2 here, plus 3(x-1).

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.090
And now if I combine
together all of these terms,

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.960
then altogether I have
4x + 2 - 3, that's -1.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:23.260
And if I multiply out the
denominator that's x^2 plus--

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.060
That 2 turned into a
3, that's interesting.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.240
I hope there aren't too many
more of those transformations.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.570
Is there another one here?

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.830
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.150
PROFESSOR: Oh, it
happened earlier on.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.620
Wow that's an interesting
vibration there.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.510
OK.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.500
Thank you.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.770
So, I guess my 3's were
speaking to my 2's.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.580
Somewhere in my past.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:07.200
OK, anyway, I think
this is now correct.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.020
So the problem is the following.

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.450
This is the problem with this.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.830
This integral was easy.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.500
I'm calling it easy, we
already know how to do it.

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.450
Over here.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:28.040
But now over here,
it's disguised.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.947
It's the same function,
but it's no longer clear

00:04:31.947 --> 00:04:32.780
how to integrate it.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.580
If you're faced
with this one, you

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:38.480
say, what am I supposed to do.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.790
And we have to get
around that difficulty.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.940
And so what we're
going to do is we're

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.660
going to unwind this disguise.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:55.830
So we have the algebra
problem that we have.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:57.950
Oh, wow.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.510
There must be
something in the water.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.280
Impressive.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.920
Wow.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.350
OK, let's see.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:14.660
Is 2/3 = 3/2?

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.960
Holy cow.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:18.760
Well that's good.

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.340
Well, I'll keep you awake
today with several other

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:23.940
transpositions here.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.760
So our algebra problem is to
detect the easy pieces which

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:36.290
are inside.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.490
And the method that
we're going to use,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.330
the one that we'll
emphasize anyway,

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:45.110
is one algebraic trick
which is a shortcut, which

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.320
is called the cover-up method.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.900
But we're going to talk about
even more general things

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.510
than that.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.300
But anyway, this is
where we're headed.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.910
Is something called
the cover-up method.

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:59.490
Alright.

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.640
So that's our intro.

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.765
And I'll just have to
remember that 2 is not 3.

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:08.130
I'll keep on repeating that.

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.280
So now here I'm going
to describe to you

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.880
how we unwind this disguise.

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.660
The first step is, we
write down the function

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:18.690
we want to integrate.

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:21.890
Which was this.

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.310
And now we have to undo the
first damage that we did.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.930
So the first step is to
factor the denominator.

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.010
And that factors, we
happen to know the factors,

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.150
so I'm not going
to carry this out.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.510
But this can be a
rather difficult step.

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.110
But we're going to
assume that it's done.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:44.030
For the purposes of
illustration here.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.780
So I factor the denominator.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.630
And now, the second thing
that I'm going to do

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:54.770
is what I'm going to
call the setup here.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.520
How I'm going to set things up.

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.340
And I'll tell you what
these things are more

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.010
systematically in a second.

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.720
And the setup is that I
want to somehow detect

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.240
what I did before.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:11.880
And I'm going to write
some unknowns here.

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.650
What I expect is that this
will break up into two pieces.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.590
One with the
denominator x - 1, and

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:23.470
the other with the
denominator x + 2.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:32.860
So now, my third step is going
to be to solve for A and B.

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:34.500
And then I'm done, if I do that.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:41.370
That's the complete
unwinding of this disguise.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:43.940
And this is where the cover-up
method comes in handy.

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:46.800
This is this method that
I'm about to describe.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.370
Now, you can do the
algebra in a clumsy way,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:50.970
or you can do it in a quick way.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:54.240
And we'd like to get efficient
about the algebra involved.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:58.590
And so let me show you what
the first step in the trick is.

00:07:58.590 --> 00:08:12.470
We're going to solve for A
by multiplying by (x - 1).

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:16.045
Now, notice if you multiply
by (x - 1) in that equation 2,

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:16.920
what you get is this.

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:21.840
You got (4x - 2) divided
by-- The (x-1)'s cancel.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:23.920
You get this on
the left-hand side.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.480
And on the right-hand
side you get A.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.620
The (x-1)'s cancel again.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.420
And then we get this extra term.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.200
Which is B x+2 times x-1.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.200
Now, the trick here, and we're
going to get even better trick

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.370
in just a second.

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:42.870
The trick here is that
I didn't try to clear

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.560
the denominators completely.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.820
I was very efficient
about the way I did it.

00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:51.390
It just cleared one factor.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:54.780
And the result here
is very useful.

00:08:54.780 --> 00:09:03.480
Namely, if I plug in now x =
1, this term drops out too.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:10.560
So what I'm going to do now
is I'm going to plug in x = 1.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:15.500
And what I get on the left-hand
side here is 4 - 1 and 1 + 2,

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:19.740
and on the left-hand side
I get A. That's the end.

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:27.150
This is my formula for A.
A happens to be equal to 1.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.100
And that's, of
course, what I expect.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:33.370
A had better be 1, because the
thing broke up into 1/(x-1) +

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:33.870
3/(x+2).

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.694
So this is the correct answer.

00:09:39.694 --> 00:09:41.610
There was a question out
here, which I missed.

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:46.110
STUDENT: Aren't
polynomials defined

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:56.210
as functions with whole powers,
or could they be square roots?

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:57.650
PROFESSOR: Are
polynomials defined

00:09:57.650 --> 00:10:00.330
as functions with whole powers,
or can they be square roots?

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:01.350
That's the question.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:04.140
The answer is, they
only have whole powers.

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:06.950
So for instance here I only
have the power 1 and 0.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:10.410
Here I have the powers 2,
1 and 0 in the denominator.

00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:16.890
Square roots are no
good for this method.

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:17.670
Another question.

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.620
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:22.260
PROFESSOR: Why did I say x = 1?

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:26.650
The reason why I said x = 1
was that it works really fast.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:30.400
You can't know this in advance,
that's part of the method.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.810
It just turns out to be
the best thing to do.

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:36.130
The fastest way of getting
at the coefficient A. Now

00:10:36.130 --> 00:10:38.510
the curious thing, let me
just pause for a second

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:39.320
before I do it.

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:43.600
If I had plugged x = 1
into the original equation,

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:45.070
I would have gotten nonsense.

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:48.210
Because I would've gotten
0 in the denominator.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:50.940
And that seems like the
most horrible thing to do.

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:54.280
The worst possible thing
to do, is to set x = 1.

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.490
On the other hand,
what we did is a trick.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.870
We multiplied by x - 1.

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:01.100
And that turned the
equation into this.

00:11:01.100 --> 00:11:05.810
So now, in disguise,
I multiplied by 0.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:07.890
But that turns out
to be legitimate.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:11.770
Because really this equation
is true for all x except 1.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.480
And then instead
of taking x = 1,

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.580
I can really take x tends to 1.

00:11:15.580 --> 00:11:17.200
That's really what I need.

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.530
The limit as x goes to one.

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:20.610
The equation is
still valid then.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:22.760
So I'm using the worst
case, the case that

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.360
looks like it's dividing by 0.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.760
And it's helping me because
it's cancelling out all

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:31.730
the information in terms of B.
So the advantage here is this

00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:36.090
cancellation that
occurs in this part.

00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:37.440
So that's the method.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.930
We're going to shorten it
much, much more in a second.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:44.640
But let me carry it out for
the other coefficient as well.

00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:51.550
So the other coefficient
I'm going to solve for B,

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:57.490
I'm going to multiply by x + 2.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:01.260
And when I do that,
I get (4x-1)/(x-1),

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:05.020
that's the left-hand side,
the very top expression there.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.890
And then down below I
get A/(x-1) ( (x+2).

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.380
And then again the
(x+2)'s cancel.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:15.960
So I get B sitting alone.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.150
And now I'm going to
do the same trick.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:21.540
I'm going to set x = -2.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:28.530
That's the value which is going
to knock out this A term here.

00:12:28.530 --> 00:12:30.770
So that cancels this
term completely.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:37.800
And what we get here all told
is - 8 - (-8 - 1)/(-2 - 1) = B.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:43.600
In other words, B = 3, which
was also what it was supposed

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.100
to be.

00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:48.460
B was this number 3, right here.

00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:50.820
Which I'm now not
going to change to 2.

00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:52.496
Because I know that it's not 2.

00:12:52.496 --> 00:12:53.370
There was a question.

00:12:53.370 --> 00:12:59.540
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:01.420
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:05.770
Now, this is the method
which is called cover-up.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:09.490
But it's really carried out
much, much faster than this.

00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:11.250
So I'm going to
review the method

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:14.300
and I'm going to show you
what it is in general.

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:23.030
So the first step is to factor
the denominator, Q. That's

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.590
what I labeled 1 over there.

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:29.350
That was the factorization
of the denominator up top.

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:36.260
The second step is what I'm
going to call the setup.

00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.250
That's step 2.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:40.915
And that's where I knew what
I was aiming for in advance.

00:13:40.915 --> 00:13:42.540
And I'm going to have
to explain to you

00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:45.780
in every instance exactly
what this setup should be.

00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:49.070
That is, what the unknowns
should be and what target,

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:53.080
simplified expression,
we're aiming for.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:54.950
So that's the setup.

00:13:54.950 --> 00:14:01.010
And then the third step is
what I'll now call cover-up.

00:14:01.010 --> 00:14:03.660
Which is just a very
fast way of doing

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.720
what I did on this last
board, which is solving

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.470
for the unknown coefficients.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.890
So now, let me perform
it for you again.

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:14.170
Over here.

00:14:14.170 --> 00:14:18.990
So it's 4x - 1 divided by-- So
this is to eliminate writing

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:19.650
here.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:20.190
Handwriting.

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:24.130
It makes it much faster.

00:14:24.130 --> 00:14:28.490
So this part just
factoring the denominator,

00:14:28.490 --> 00:14:31.290
that was 1, that was step 1.

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:34.050
And then step 2, again,
is the setup, which

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:39.700
is setting it up like this.

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.580
Alright, that's the setup.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.150
And now I claim that
without writing very much,

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.350
I can figure out
what A and B are.

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.350
Just by staring at this.

00:14:51.350 --> 00:14:53.670
So now what I'm going
to do is I'm just going

00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:55.720
to think what I did over there.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.570
And I'm just going
to do it directly.

00:14:57.570 --> 00:15:02.680
So let me show you what the
method consists of visually.

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:08.950
I'm going to cover up, that
is, knock out this factor,

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:13.560
and focus on this number here.

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.610
And I'm going to plug
in the thing that

00:15:15.610 --> 00:15:17.580
makes this 0, which is x = 1.

00:15:17.580 --> 00:15:20.180
So I'm plugging in x = 1.

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:21.670
To this left-hand side.

00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:28.195
And what I get is (4
- 1)/(1 + 2) = A. Now,

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:29.820
that's the same thing
I did over there.

00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:33.610
I just did it by skipping the
intermediate algebra step,

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.860
which is a lot of writing.

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.580
So the cover-up method really
amounts to the following thing.

00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:40.385
I'm thinking of
multiplying this over here.

00:15:40.385 --> 00:15:43.240
It cancels this and it gets
rid of everything else.

00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.960
And it just leaves me with
A on the right-hand side.

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:47.680
And I have to get rid
of it on this side.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.030
So in other words,
by eliminating this,

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.090
I'm isolating a on
the right-hand side.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.170
So the cover-up is that I'm
covering this and getting

00:15:56.170 --> 00:15:57.670
A out of it.

00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:59.560
Similarly, I can
do the same thing

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:04.720
with B. It's focused
on the value x = -2.

00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.010
And B is what I'm getting
on the right-hand side.

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:10.400
And then I have
to cover up this.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.530
So if I cover up that, then
what's left over, with x = -2,

00:16:14.530 --> 00:16:16.720
is again (-8 - 1)/(-2 - 1).

00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:26.970
So this is the way the method
gets carried out in practice.

00:16:26.970 --> 00:16:32.070
Writing, essentially,
the least you can.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:36.580
Now, when you get to
several variables,

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:42.170
it becomes just way more
convenient to do this.

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:45.660
So now, let me just review
when cover-up works.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:55.980
So this cover-up
method works if Q(x)

00:16:55.980 --> 00:17:06.060
has distinct linear factors.

00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:11.780
And, so you need
two things here.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.840
It has to factor
completely, the denominator

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.180
has to factor completely.

00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:20.250
And the degree of
the numerator has

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:27.750
to be strictly less than the
degree of the denominator.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:30.080
I'm going to give
you an example here.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:36.010
So, for instance-- And this
tells you the general pattern

00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.070
of the setup also.

00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:44.090
Say you had x^2 +
3x + 8, let's say.

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.020
Over (x - 1) (x - 2) (x + 5).

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:52.920
So here I'm going to
tell you the setup.

00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.710
The setup is going to be -
A/(x-1) + B/(x-2) + C/(x+5).

00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:04.620
And it will always
break up into something.

00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:06.860
So however many
factors you have,

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:09.770
you'll have to put in a
term for each of those.

00:18:09.770 --> 00:18:13.150
And then you can
find each number here

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:26.060
by this cover-up method.

00:18:26.060 --> 00:18:29.450
Now we're done with that.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.280
And now we have to go on to
the algebraic complications.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:38.420
So would the first typical
algebraic complication be.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:50.760
It would be repeated
roots or repeated factors.

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:56.850
Let me get one that doesn't come
out to be extremely ugly here.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:02.930
So this is what
we'll call Example 2.

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.620
And this is going to
work when the degree,

00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.650
you always need that the
degree of the numerator

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:12.060
is less than the degree
of the denominator.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:22.980
And Q has now repeated
linear factors.

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.030
So let's see which example
I wanted to show you.

00:19:26.030 --> 00:19:28.830
So let's just give this here.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:34.080
I'll just repeat
the denominator.

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.580
With an extra factor like this.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.440
Now, the main thing
you need to know,

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.370
since I've already performed
the factorization for you.

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.140
Already performed Step 1.

00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.177
This is Step 1 here.

00:19:49.177 --> 00:19:50.760
You have to factor
things all the way,

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:53.910
and that's already
been done for you.

00:19:53.910 --> 00:19:56.840
And here's what this setup is.

00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:05.540
The setup is that it's of the
form A/(x-1) plus B/(x-1)^2 -

00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:11.550
we need another term for the
square here - plus C/(x+2).

00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:17.210
In general, if you
have more powers

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.310
you just need to keep on
putting in those powers.

00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:24.140
You need one for
each of the powers.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.340
Why does it have to be squared?

00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:27.570
OK.

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:28.680
Good question.

00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:31.660
So why in the world
am I doing this?

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:37.070
Let me just give you one hint
as to why I'm doing this.

00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:41.600
It's very, very much like the
decimal expansion of a number

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:44.820
or, say, the base 2
expansion of a number.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:21:00.410
So, for, example the number 7/16
is 0/2 + 1/2^2 + 1/2^3 plus,

00:21:00.410 --> 00:21:02.120
is that right?

00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:07.300
So it's 4/16 + 1/2^4.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:09.090
It's this sort of thing.

00:21:09.090 --> 00:21:11.880
And I'm getting this
power and this power.

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:13.455
If I have higher
powers, I'm going

00:21:13.455 --> 00:21:14.705
to have to have more and more.

00:21:14.705 --> 00:21:17.310
So this is what happens
when I have a 2^4.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.550
I have to represent
things like this.

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:24.430
That's what's coming out of
this piece with the repetitious

00:21:24.430 --> 00:21:24.930
here.

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.390
Of the powers.

00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:31.070
This is just an analogy.

00:21:31.070 --> 00:21:31.906
Of what we're doing.

00:21:31.906 --> 00:21:33.280
Yeah, another
question over here.

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.455
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:34.455 --> 00:21:35.080
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:36.621
So this is an example,
but it's meant

00:21:36.621 --> 00:21:38.860
to represent the general
case and I will also

00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.210
give you a general picture.

00:21:41.210 --> 00:21:43.442
For sure, once you have
the second power here,

00:21:43.442 --> 00:21:45.400
you'll need both the
first and the second power

00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:46.504
mentioned over here.

00:21:46.504 --> 00:21:48.420
And since there's only
a first power over here

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:52.060
I only have to mention a
first power over there.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.790
If this were a 3 here, there
would be one more term which

00:21:55.790 --> 00:22:00.630
would be the one for
(x-1)^3 in the denominator.

00:22:00.630 --> 00:22:03.940
That's what you just said.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:08.330
OK, now, what's different
about this setup

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:11.670
is that the cover-up
method, although it works,

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:13.120
it doesn't work so well.

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.660
It doesn't work quite as well.

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:29.790
The cover-up works for
the coefficients B and C,

00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:38.370
not A. We'll have a quick
method for the numbers B and C.

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:40.530
To figure out what they are.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:42.630
But it will be a
little slower to get

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:47.910
to A, which we will do last.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:56.780
Let me show you how it works.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:23:01.610
First of all, I'm going to do
the ordinary cover-up with C.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.610
So for C, I just want
to do the same old thing

00:23:05.610 --> 00:23:06.360
that I did before.

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.370
I cover up this,
and that's going

00:23:09.370 --> 00:23:12.300
to get rid of all the junk
except for the C term.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.800
So I have to plug in x = -2.

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:21.810
And I get x-- sorry, I get
(-2)^2 + 2 in the numerator.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.660
And I get (-2 - 1)^2
in the denominator.

00:23:25.660 --> 00:23:28.690
Remember I'm covering this up.

00:23:28.690 --> 00:23:30.790
So that's all there is
on the left-hand side.

00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:37.780
And on the right-hand
side all there is C.

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:39.980
Everything else got killed
off, because it was x -

00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:40.580
2 times that.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.570
That's 0 times all
that other stuff.

00:23:42.570 --> 00:23:45.240
And the x - 2 over
here canceled.

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.330
This is the shortcut
that I just described,

00:23:47.330 --> 00:23:50.920
and this is much faster than
doing all that arithmetic.

00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:52.620
And algebra.

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.160
So all together this
is a 6/9, right?

00:23:57.160 --> 00:24:09.140
So it's C = 6/9, which is 2/3.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.640
Now, the other one
which is easy to do,

00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:14.730
I'm going to do by
the slow method first.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:17.350
But you omit a term.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:23.380
The idea is to cover up
the other bad factor.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.277
Cover-ups, I'll do it both
the fast way and the slow way.

00:24:27.277 --> 00:24:29.110
I'll do it the fast way
first, and then I'll

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:30.440
show you the slow way.

00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:32.467
The fast way is
to cover this up.

00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:34.300
And then I have to cover
up everything else.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.740
That gets eliminated.

00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:40.950
And that includes everything
but B. So I get B on this side.

00:24:40.950 --> 00:24:42.970
And I get 1 on that side.

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:45.790
So that's (1^2 + 2) / (1 + 2).

00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:56.250
So in other words, B = 1.

00:24:56.250 --> 00:24:58.710
That was pretty fast, so let
me show you what arithmetic

00:24:58.710 --> 00:25:00.060
was hiding behind that.

00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:01.690
What algebra was
hiding behind it.

00:25:01.690 --> 00:25:06.900
What I was really doing is this.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:16.390
And multiplying through
by (x-1)^2, so I got this.

00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:19.910
So this canceled here, so
this C just stands alone.

00:25:19.910 --> 00:25:21.790
And then I have here
C/(x+2) (x-1)^2.

00:25:26.290 --> 00:25:30.000
Notice again, I
cleared out that one--

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.040
this term from the
denominator and sent it over

00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:33.600
to the other side.

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:38.790
Now, what's happening
is that when I set x = 1

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:43.050
here, this term is dying.

00:25:43.050 --> 00:25:44.730
This term is going
away, because there's

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.840
more powers in the numerator
than in the denominator.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.070
This is still 0.

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.330
And this one is gone also.

00:25:52.330 --> 00:25:58.220
So all that's left is B. Now,
I cannot pull that off with

00:25:58.220 --> 00:25:59.820
a single power of x - 1.

00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:02.250
I can't expose the A term.

00:26:02.250 --> 00:26:03.962
It's the B term
that I can expose.

00:26:03.962 --> 00:26:06.170
Because I can multiply
through by this thing squared.

00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:09.310
If I multiply through
by just x - 1,

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.520
what'll happen here is I won't
have canceled this (x-1)^2.

00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:13.160
It's useless.

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.020
I still have a 0
in the denominator.

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.150
I'll have B / 0 when
I plug in x = 1.

00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:22.060
Which I can't use.

00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:32.950
Again, the cover-up method
is giving us B and C, not A.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:36.510
Now, for the last
term, for A, I'm

00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:40.380
going to just have to be
straightforward about it.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:51.260
And so I'll just suggest for A,
plug in your favorite number.

00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:59.510
So plug in my favorite number.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:01.430
Which is x = 0.

00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:04.617
And you won't be
able to plug in x = 0

00:27:04.617 --> 00:27:05.700
if you've already used it.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:09.770
Here the two numbers we've
already used are x = 1

00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:13.820
and x = -2.

00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:18.300
But we haven't used x =
0 yet, so that's good.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.400
I'm going to plug in now
x = 0 into the equation.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.450
What do I get?

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:35.070
I get 0 (0^2 + 2) / ((-1)^2
* 2) is equal to, let's see.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.800
A is the thing
that I don't know.

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:48.190
So it's A A/(-1) + B/(x-1)^2,
so B = 1, so that's 1 1/(-1)^2.

00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:51.760
And then C was 2/3.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.490
2/3 / (x+2).

00:27:55.490 --> 00:28:00.900
So that's 0 + 2.

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.690
Don't give up at this point.

00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:03.900
This is a lot of algebra.

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.290
You really have to plug
in all these numbers.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:08.400
You make one arithmetic
mistake and you're always

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:09.649
going to get the wrong answer.

00:28:09.649 --> 00:28:16.790
This is very
arithmetically intensive.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.980
However, it does
simplify at this point.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:22.680
We have 2/2, that's 1.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:27.790
Is equal to -A + 1 + 1/3.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.050
So let's see.

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:34.920
A on the other side,
this becomes A = 1/3.

00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:35.520
And that's it.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.600
This is the end.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.020
We've we've simplified
our function.

00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:48.280
And now it's easy to integrate.

00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:48.780
Question.

00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:49.488
Another question.

00:28:49.488 --> 00:29:01.927
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:01.927 --> 00:29:04.510
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
if x = 0 has already been used,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:05.590
what do I do?

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:10.024
And the answer is,
pick something else.

00:29:10.024 --> 00:29:11.440
And you said pick
a random number.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.400
And that's right, except
that if you really

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:18.020
picked a random number
it would be 4.12567843,

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.000
which would be difficult.
What you want to pick

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.240
is the easiest possible
number you can think of.

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:24.740
Yeah.

00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:32.710
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:37.050
PROFESSOR: If you had, as in
this sort of situation here,

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.690
more powers.

00:29:39.690 --> 00:29:41.610
Wouldn't you have
more variables.

00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:42.900
Very good question.

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.490
That's absolutely right.

00:29:44.490 --> 00:29:47.860
This was a 3 by 3
system in disguise,

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.080
for these three
unknowns, A, B and C.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.770
What we started with in
the previous problem was

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:53.950
two variables.

00:29:53.950 --> 00:29:56.190
It's over here, the
variables A and B.

00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:59.310
And as the degree of
the denominator goes up,

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:02.900
the number of variables goes up.

00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.040
It gets more and more
and more complicated.

00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:06.820
More and more
arithmetically intensive.

00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.077
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:09.077 --> 00:30:09.910
PROFESSOR: Well, so.

00:30:09.910 --> 00:30:11.535
The question is, how
would you solve it

00:30:11.535 --> 00:30:12.880
if you have two unknowns.

00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:16.610
That's exactly the point here.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:19.560
This is a system of simultaneous
equations for unknowns.

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.180
And we have little tricks for
isolating single variables.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.880
Otherwise we're stuck with
solving the whole system.

00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:28.560
And you'd have to solve the
whole system by elimination,

00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:35.980
various other tricks.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.950
I'll say a little
more about that later.

00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:47.610
Now, I have to get one
step more complicated

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:53.560
with my next example.

00:30:53.560 --> 00:31:02.860
My next example is going
to have a quadratic factor.

00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:05.760
So still I'm sticking to
the degree of the polynomial

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:08.520
and the numerator is less than
the degree of the polynomial

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.660
in the denominator.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:21.700
And I'm going to take the case
where Q has a quadratic factor.

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:26.140
Let me just again
illustrate this by example.

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:30.470
I have here (x - 1) (x^2 + 1).

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:34.630
I'll make it about
as easy as they come.

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:38.830
Now, the setup will be
slightly different here.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.510
Here's the setup.

00:31:40.510 --> 00:31:42.570
It's already factored.

00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:44.360
I've already done
as much as I can do.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.820
I can't factor this x^2 + 1 into
linear factors unless you know

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:49.940
about complex numbers.

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:51.600
If you know about
complex numbers

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.170
this method becomes much easier.

00:31:53.170 --> 00:31:55.400
And it comes back to
the cover-up method.

00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:58.370
Which is the way that the
cover-up method was originally

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.060
conceived by Heaviside.

00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:04.280
But you won't get
to that until 18.03.

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.610
So we'll wait.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.360
This, by the way, is a method
which is used for integration.

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.980
But it was invented
to do something

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:13.565
with Laplace transforms
and inversion

00:32:13.565 --> 00:32:15.600
of certain kinds of
differential equations.

00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.020
By Heaviside.

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:21.530
And so it came much
later than integration.

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:26.360
But anyway, it's a
very convenient method.

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.210
So here's the setup
with this one.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:34.440
Again, we want a term
for this (x - 1) factor.

00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:37.880
And now we're going to also have
a term with the denominator x^2

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.120
+ 1.

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.760
But this is the difference.

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.590
It's now going to be a
first degree polynomial.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:53.040
One degree down from
the quadratic here.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:55.620
So this is what I keep
on calling the setup,

00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:57.250
this is number 2.

00:32:57.250 --> 00:32:59.870
You have to know that in
advance based on the pattern

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.160
that you see on
the left-hand side.

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:03.660
Yes.

00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:12.630
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:12.630 --> 00:33:15.130
PROFESSOR: The question is, if
the degree of the numerator--

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:18.290
So in this case,
if this were cubed,

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:20.510
and this is matching with
the denominator, which

00:33:20.510 --> 00:33:23.590
is total of degree 3.

00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:26.910
The answer is that
this does not work.

00:33:26.910 --> 00:33:29.150
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:29.150 --> 00:33:30.995
PROFESSOR: It
definitely doesn't work.

00:33:30.995 --> 00:33:33.370
And we're going to have to do
something totally different

00:33:33.370 --> 00:33:34.050
to handle it.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.180
Which turns out, fortunately,
to be much easier than this.

00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.850
But we'll deal with
that at the end.

00:33:41.850 --> 00:33:43.227
Keep this in mind.

00:33:43.227 --> 00:33:45.310
This is an easy way to
make a mistake if you start

00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:47.230
with a higher degree numerator.

00:33:47.230 --> 00:33:51.300
You'll never get
the right answer.

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.870
So now, so I have my setup now.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.840
And now what can I do?

00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:58.960
Well, I claim that I
can still do cover-up

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:05.790
for A. It's the same idea.

00:34:05.790 --> 00:34:07.680
I cover this guy up.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.460
And if I really multiply by it
it would knock everything out

00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.550
but A. So I cover this
up and I plug in x = 1.

00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:25.460
So I get here 1^2 / (1^2 +1)
= A. In other words, A = 1/2.

00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.560
Again cover-up is pretty
fast, as you can see.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:32.030
It's not too bad.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:41.040
Now, at this next stage,
I want to find B and C.

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.990
And the best idea
is the slow way.

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:48.120
Here, it's not too terrible.

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.010
But it's just what
we're going to do.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:54.270
Which is to clear the
denominators completely.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:35:05.520
So for B and C, just
clear the denominator.

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.645
That means multiply through
by that whole business.

00:35:07.645 --> 00:35:09.978
Now, when you do that on the
left-hand side you're going

00:35:09.978 --> 00:35:10.870
to get x^2.

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:12.940
Because I got rid of
the whole denominator.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:16.850
On the right-hand side when
I bring this up, the x -

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:18.600
1 will cancel with this.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:23.160
So the A term will
be A(x^2 + 1).

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:29.230
And the Bx + C term will have
a remaining factor of x - 1.

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:33.300
Because the x^2 + 1 will cancel.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:38.670
Again, the arithmetic
here is not too terrible.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:41.000
Now I'm going to
do the following.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.550
I'm going to look
at the x^2 term.

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:49.580
On the left-hand side
and the right-hand side.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:51.970
And that will give me
one equation for B and C.

00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:54.490
And then I'm going to do the
same thing with another term.

00:35:54.490 --> 00:35:57.350
The x^2 term on the left-hand
side, the coefficient is 1.

00:35:57.350 --> 00:35:59.740
It's 1 times x^2.

00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:06.030
On the other side, it's A.
Remember I actually have A.

00:36:06.030 --> 00:36:08.870
So I'm going to put
it in, it's 1/2.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:11.250
So this is the A term.

00:36:11.250 --> 00:36:14.020
And so I get 1/2 x^2.

00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:18.640
And then the only other x^2 is
when this Bx multiplies this x.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:24.440
So Bx * x is Bx^2, so this is--
the other coefficient on x^2 is

00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:36.060
B. And that forces B to be 1/2.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:41.370
And last of all, I'm
going to do the x^0 term.

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:44.530
Or, otherwise known
as the constant term.

00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:48.650
And on the left-hand side,
the constant term is 0.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:51.270
There is no constant term.

00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:57.310
On the right-hand side there's
a constant term, 1/2 * 1.

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:58.520
That's 1/2 here.

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.760
And then there's
another constant term,

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:09.430
which is this constant
times this -1 Which is -C.

00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:17.952
And so the conclusion
here is that C = 1/2.

00:37:17.952 --> 00:37:18.660
Another question.

00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:19.160
Yeah.

00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:33.130
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:37.970
PROFESSOR: There's also
an x^0 hidden in here.

00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:40.890
Sorry, an x^1, that's what
you were asking about, sorry.

00:37:40.890 --> 00:37:42.400
There's also an x^1.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:46.050
The only reason why I didn't go
to the x^1 is that it turns out

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.080
with these two I didn't need it.

00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:51.150
The other thing is
that by experience, I

00:37:51.150 --> 00:37:53.320
know that the extreme
ends of the multiplication

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.690
are the easiest ends.

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:57.150
And the middle terms
have tons of cross terms.

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:59.750
And so I don't like the middle
term as much because it always

00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:01.130
involves more arithmetic.

00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:05.530
So I stick to the lowest and
the highest terms if I can.

00:38:05.530 --> 00:38:07.390
So that was really
a sneaky thing.

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:10.460
I did that without
saying anything.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:10.960
Yes.

00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.095
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:14.095 --> 00:38:15.470
PROFESSOR: Another
good question.

00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:17.120
Could I just set x equals 0?

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:17.910
Absolutely.

00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:22.370
In fact, that's equivalent
to picking out the x^0 term.

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:24.150
And you could plug in numbers.

00:38:24.150 --> 00:38:25.140
If you wanted.

00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:27.820
That's another way of doing
this besides doing that.

00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:30.930
So you can also plug in numbers.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:38.060
Can plug in numbers. x = 0.

00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:42.210
Actually, not x = 1, right?

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:44.292
-1, 2, etc.

00:38:44.292 --> 00:38:46.000
Not 1 just because
we've already used it.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.270
We won't get interesting
information out.

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:48.770
Yes.

00:38:48.770 --> 00:38:56.347
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:56.347 --> 00:38:57.930
PROFESSOR: So the
question is, could I

00:38:57.930 --> 00:38:59.900
have done it this other way.

00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:02.880
With the polynomial,
with this other one.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.020
Yes, absolutely.

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:05.436
So in other words
what I've taught

00:39:05.436 --> 00:39:09.466
you now is two choices which
are equally reasonable.

00:39:09.466 --> 00:39:10.840
The one that I
picked was the one

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:14.105
that was the fastest
for this guy and the one

00:39:14.105 --> 00:39:15.980
that was fastest for
this one, but I could've

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.040
done the other way around.

00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:22.490
There are a lot of ways of
solving simultaneous equations.

00:39:22.490 --> 00:39:23.777
Yeah, another question.

00:39:23.777 --> 00:39:24.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:26.318
PROFESSOR: The question
is the following.

00:39:26.318 --> 00:39:28.610
So now everybody can
understand the question.

00:39:28.610 --> 00:39:33.640
If this, instead of being
x^2 + 1, this were x^3 + 1.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.360
So that's an important
case to understand.

00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:39.420
That's a case in which
this denominator is not

00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:41.020
fully factored.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:46.830
So it's an x^3 + 1, you would
have to factor out an x + 1.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:49.630
So that would be a situation
like this, you have an x^3 + 1,

00:39:49.630 --> 00:39:57.740
but that's (x+1) (x^2 +x
+ 1), this kind of thing.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.830
If that's the right, there must
be a minus sign in here maybe.

00:40:01.830 --> 00:40:03.240
OK, something like this.

00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.274
Right?

00:40:07.274 --> 00:40:08.190
Isn't that what it is?

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:11.561
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:11.561 --> 00:40:12.810
PROFESSOR: I think it's right.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:15.930
But anyway, the point is
that you have to factor it.

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:17.920
And then you have a
linear and a quadratic.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:20.880
So you're always going
to be faced eventually

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:23.484
with linear factors
and quadratic factors.

00:40:23.484 --> 00:40:25.650
If you have a cubic, that
means you haven't factored

00:40:25.650 --> 00:40:28.620
sufficiently.

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.947
So you're still back in Step 1.

00:40:31.947 --> 00:40:32.780
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:34.500
PROFESSOR: In the x^3 + 1 case?

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:36.610 --> 00:40:39.610
PROFESSOR: In the x^3 + 1
case, we are out of luck until

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:41.700
we've completed
the factorization.

00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:43.470
Once we've completed
the factorization,

00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:46.370
we're going to have to
deal with these two factors

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:48.920
as denominators.

00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.730
So it'll be this plus
something over x + 1

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:58.160
plus a Bx + C type of
thing over this thing here.

00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.730
That's what's eventually
going to happen.

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.940
But hold on to that idea.

00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:14.340
Let me carry out one
more example here.

00:41:14.340 --> 00:41:17.870
So I've figured out
what all the values are.

00:41:17.870 --> 00:41:21.420
But I think it's also
worth it to remember now

00:41:21.420 --> 00:41:29.140
that we also have to
carry out the integration.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:38.220
What I've just shown you is that
the integral of x^2 dx over (x

00:41:38.220 --> 00:41:43.180
- 1)(x^2 + 1) is equal to,
and I've split up into these

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:43.970
pieces.

00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:45.070
So what are the pieces?

00:41:45.070 --> 00:42:01.560
The pieces are, 1/2, x -
1, plus 1/2 x / (x^2 + 1).

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.990
This is the A term.

00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:04.400
This is the B term.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:12.460
And then there's the C term.

00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.340
So we'd better remember that we
know how to antidifferentiate

00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.300
these things.

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.256
In other words, I want
to finish the problem.

00:42:20.256 --> 00:42:21.630
The others were
pretty easy, so I

00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:23.310
didn't bother to
finish my sentence,

00:42:23.310 --> 00:42:25.570
but here I want to
be careful and have

00:42:25.570 --> 00:42:28.850
you realize that there's
something a little more to do.

00:42:28.850 --> 00:42:31.340
First of all we have the,
the first one is no problem.

00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:35.240
That's this.

00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:39.910
The second one actually
is not too bad either.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:45.340
This is, by the advanced
guessing method,

00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.696
my favorite method,
something like the logarithm,

00:42:47.696 --> 00:42:50.070
because that's what's going
to appear in the denominator.

00:42:50.070 --> 00:42:51.770
And then, if you
differentiate this,

00:42:51.770 --> 00:42:53.620
you're going to
get 2x over this.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.030
But here we have 1/2.

00:42:55.030 --> 00:42:59.470
So altogether it's 1/4 of this.

00:42:59.470 --> 00:43:02.470
So I fixed the coefficient here.

00:43:02.470 --> 00:43:06.180
And then the last one,
you have to think back

00:43:06.180 --> 00:43:09.060
to some level of memorization
here and remember that this

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:15.610
is 1/2 the arc tangent.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:20.870
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:22.200
PROFESSOR: Why did I go to 1/4?

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.570
Because in disguise,
for this guy,

00:43:24.570 --> 00:43:35.140
I was thinking d/dx of ln(x^2
+ 1) is 2x / (x^2 + 1).

00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:39.880
Because it's the derivative
of this divided by itself.

00:43:39.880 --> 00:43:43.300
This is-- The derivative
of ln u is u' / u.

00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:50.030
(ln u)' = u' / u.

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:54.350
That was what I applied.

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:58.210
And what I had was 1/2, so I
need a total of 1/4 to cancel.

00:43:58.210 --> 00:44:06.640
So 2/4 is 1/2.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.990
Now I've got to get you
out of one more deep hole.

00:44:09.990 --> 00:44:12.900
And I'm going to save the
general pattern for next time.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:27.860
But I do want to
clarify one thing.

00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.040
So let's handle this thing.

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:33.650
What if the degree
of P is bigger than

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:41.570
or equal to the degree of Q.
That's the thing that I claimed

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:42.810
was easier.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:45.880
And I'm going to describe
to you how it's done.

00:44:45.880 --> 00:44:48.940
Now, in analogy,
with numbers you

00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:55.070
might call this an
improper fraction.

00:44:55.070 --> 00:44:59.850
That's the thing that
should echo in your mind

00:44:59.850 --> 00:45:01.970
when you're thinking about this.

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.600
And I'm just going to
do it by example here.

00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.800
Let's see., I
cooked up an example

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.730
so that I don't
make an arithmetic

00:45:09.730 --> 00:45:11.220
mistake along the way.

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:16.990
So there are two or three
steps that I need to explain.

00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:18.030
So here's an example.

00:45:18.030 --> 00:45:21.320
The denominator's degree 2,
the numerator is degree 3.

00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:24.610
It well exceeds, so
there's a problem here.

00:45:24.610 --> 00:45:27.880
Our method is not going to work.

00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:32.260
And the first step that
I want to carry out

00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:36.370
is to reverse Step 1.

00:45:36.370 --> 00:45:38.371
That is, I don't want
the factorization

00:45:38.371 --> 00:45:39.620
for what I'm going to do next.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.040
I want it multiplied out.

00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:48.670
That means I have to multiply
through, so I get x^2 + x - 2.

00:45:48.670 --> 00:45:52.980
I'm back to the
starting place here.

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:56.510
And now, the next thing
that I'm going to do

00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:01.130
is, I'm going to
use long division.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:04.270
That's how you convert
an improper fraction

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:07.432
to a proper fraction.

00:46:07.432 --> 00:46:08.890
This is something
you were supposed

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:16.780
to learn in, I don't
know, Grade 4, I know.

00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:23.970
Grade 3, Grade 4,
Grade 5, Grade 6, etc.

00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:27.560
So here's how it works in
the case of polynomials.

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:31.030
It's kind of amusing.

00:46:31.030 --> 00:46:37.760
So we're dividing this
polynomial into that one.

00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.950
And so the quotient to
first order here is x.

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:44.300
That is, that's going
to match the top terms.

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:48.500
So I get x^3 + x^2 - 2x.

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.310
That's the product.

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:51.890
And now I subtract.

00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:53.990
And it cancels.

00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:58.440
So we get here -x^2 + 2x.

00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:01.110
That's the difference.

00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:04.260
And now I need to divide
this next term in.

00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:08.190
And I need a -1.

00:47:08.190 --> 00:47:14.700
So -1 times this
is -x^2 - x + 2.

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.260
And I subtract.

00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.800
And the x^2's cancel.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:24.210
And here I get +3x - 2.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:27.090
Now, this thing has a name.

00:47:27.090 --> 00:47:30.880
This is called the quotient.

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.090
And this thing also has a name.

00:47:33.090 --> 00:47:39.070
This is called the remainder.

00:47:39.070 --> 00:47:43.530
And now I'll show you how
it works by sticking it

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.560
into the answer here.

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.250
The quotient is x - 1.

00:47:47.250 --> 00:47:52.010
And the remainder is,
let's get down there.

00:47:52.010 --> 00:47:53.810
(3x - 2) / (x^2 + x - 2).

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:03.300
So the punchline here
is that this thing

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.450
is easy to integrate.

00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:08.190
This is easy.

00:48:08.190 --> 00:48:13.350
And this one, you
can use, now you

00:48:13.350 --> 00:48:18.292
can use cover-up, The
method that we had before.

00:48:18.292 --> 00:48:19.750
Because the degree
of the numerator

00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:22.700
is now below the degree
of the denominator.

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.920
It's now first degree and
this is second degree.

00:48:25.920 --> 00:48:27.870
What you can't do
is use cover-up

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:29.950
to start out with here.

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.630
That will give you
the wrong answer.

00:48:32.630 --> 00:48:36.952
So that's the end for today,
and see you next time.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.980
PROFESSOR: Welcome
back, everybody to 8.03.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.080
Very happy to see you again.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.610
So as you can see
from the slides,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.960
we will continue the
discussion from last time.

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.770
We were talking about
interference phenomena,

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.170
which involve two or
multiple point light source.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.990
And they actually
interact with each other

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.780
and produce interesting
phenomenon, which

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.820
we see with laser,
with water ripples,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.400
and also we discussed how to
design a phased radar together.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.280
And one thing which we learned
is that if you, for example,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.420
have two slit interference, OK.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.280
And if you look at the intensity
of the resulting interference

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.390
pattern as a function
of angle, you

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.350
will see that there are
peaks, periodic peaks

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.020
as a function of angle.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.650
And we also know
how to calculate

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.775
where would be the
principal maxima, what

00:01:29.775 --> 00:01:31.930
would be the minima,
which will have

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.871
destructive interference between
the two point light source.

00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:36.370
OK?

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.810
So as usual, we go from
one electromagnetic wave

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.160
to two electromagnetic waves
and two unelectromagnetic waves.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.360
And today we are going
to do infinite number

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.010
of electromagnetic
waves and they

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.210
are going to interact
with each other

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.880
or superpose an infinite
number of electromagnetic waves

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.080
all together.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.360
And that brings us to that
discussion of diffraction.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.260
OK?

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.550
So what are we going
to talk about today is,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.790
for example, a point light
source, a laser pointer.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.410
And what would the image of
a laser pointer look like?

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.420
When these lasers pass through
a single slit or just the laser

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.920
itself.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.510
The laser beam itself, what
will happen to this laser beam?

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.320
And also we will make some
comments on the Star Trek,

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.006
for example.

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:33.505
Right?

00:02:33.505 --> 00:02:38.250
They have this super weapon
which they shoot enemy

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.840
with this laser beam.

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.710
And we'll see how practical that
is by the end of this course.

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.380
And the third thing is that
it's related to resolution.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.630
So we are going to
design a phone, screen

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.230
of your mobile phone together to
see what is actually practical,

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.470
what is actually not practical.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.370
If Yen-Jie is opening a new
company to develop jPhone,

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.030
what should be the requirement
for the screen, for example?

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.290
Which, I'm not going to do it.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.030
So this is actually what we
are going to discuss today.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.470
So we are interested
in a situation where

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.700
you have plane waves, and those
plane waves are approaching

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.140
from the left-hand side of the
screen toward a single slit.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.010
So basically, the
setup is like this.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.290
So you have those
wavefront basically

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.560
is traveling to the right-hand
side, the plane waves.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:48.910
And on the wall, there's a
slit or hole, which is actually

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.730
a opening, and the
waves can actually

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.980
penetrate through this hole.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:02.140
The width of this hole is
denoted by, or essentially

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.080
given to you, which
is actually D.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.305
And we were wondering what
is going to happen to--

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.720
what are we going to observe on
the screen, which is actually

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.089
pretty far away from the wall.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:29.950
And this screen is
actually used to observe

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.560
the pattern of the
interference pattern

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:39.110
of the electromagnetic
wave passing this hole.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:45.600
So, as we discussed last time,
due to Huygens' principle,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:52.730
every point is actually
like a point-like source

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.190
of spherical waves.

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.560
So, as you can see
now, we actually

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.620
consider the size of our slit.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:07.740
Therefore, there must be a lot
of point-like source inside,

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.470
in this slit.

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.950
When this wavefront actually
pass through this wall,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.240
there should be infinite
number of point-like source.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.680
And all of them, due
to Huygens' principle,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.520
is going to be like point-like
source of spherical waves.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:30.280
And they are all emitting from
all those possible location,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.810
and that they are
overlapping each other

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.450
and they have constructive
or destructive interference

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.650
with each other.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.510
So that is actually
what is happening

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.970
with this single-slit
experiment.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.670
And we call that diffraction.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.930
So you may be wondering, why
do I call it diffraction?

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.280
Why not interference?

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.110
Because it's basically the
same phenomenon, right?

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.810
I think it's just a
matter of wording.

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:02.300
Feynman actually
commented on this,

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.340
and he said that, nobody
was able to define

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.960
the difference between
diffraction and interference

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.040
in a satisfactory way.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.060
Which is actually true.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.780
So it's just a
matter of wording.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.780
So we are looking at exactly the
same phenomena when we actually

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:23.960
discuss this experiment.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.570
So what I am going
to do today is now

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.840
to introduce to you the
way we can deal with this.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.010
I'm sure you have seen this
experiment before, maybe

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.130
in 8.02 or in high school days.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:39.350
On the other hand, what
we are going to do today

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:43.160
is to really make use
of the mathematics which

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.440
we have learned from 18.03
or from the previous lectures

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.300
to attack this problem.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:51.950
So what is actually
the mathematics

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.560
I am going to use today?

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.680
So the mathematics
which I would like

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.040
to use to attack this
problem is to use

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.240
a two-dimensional
Fourier transform.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.690
I think by now you should
not be afraid of Fourier

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:09.904
transform any more.

00:07:09.904 --> 00:07:11.070
It should be pretty natural.

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:14.540
It's just integration,
and you evaluate, and then

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:17.940
you are going to get
the corresponding number

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:19.160
whatsoever.

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.790
But the cool thing is
that 18.03 give them

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.340
physical meaning
of those numbers,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.950
and I'm going to
talk about that.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.020
So what is actually the Fourier
transform I'm going to use?

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:35.570
So I am going to
evaluate C, which

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:41.060
is a function of kx and ky.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.520
And what is actually
this C function?

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.650
This C function is equal to
1 over 4 pi squared, which

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.180
I really don't care too much.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:52.400
It's just a constant.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.730
And I do the integration
from minus infinity

00:07:55.730 --> 00:08:01.910
to infinity for dx, and I do a
integration from minus infinity

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:08.270
to infinity dy, a
small letter scale, dy.

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:11.210
And I have a f function,
which I will introduce you

00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.420
what the f function mean, what
does the f function actually

00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.820
represent.

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:26.420
And exponential minus i, k is
the vector which is actually

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.330
telling you the direction
of the propagation

00:08:29.330 --> 00:08:35.400
of the spherical wave,
times r, which is actually

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.440
a function of x and y.

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.630
And this is actually
the kind of integration

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:45.530
which we will employ in order
to attack the problem we

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:50.570
are interested in this lecture.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.740
So, what does this
integration mean?

00:08:53.740 --> 00:09:03.160
So we have basically some kind
of this two-dimensional Fourier

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.290
transform.

00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:08.200
The f function is
actually telling you

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.710
the shape of the source.

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:14.170
So basically, this is
actually telling you

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.840
about the shape of the source.

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.620
As we discussed
before, the shape

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:34.700
of the source, every
point on this shape

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:41.360
is a source of spherical
wave, by Huygens' principle.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.740
So that is actually
telling you where should I

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.410
do the integration.

00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:53.690
This one, exponential i
k dot r, what is that?

00:09:53.690 --> 00:10:00.000
This is actually telling you
about the spherical wave.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.290
So remember, we were doing
two-slit interference before,

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.270
and we have actually two
exponential function, if you

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.030
remember from last lecture.

00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.190
So now, this is
actually put there

00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:15.350
because each source
you are going

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:18.400
to get exponential
function, which is actually

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.060
presenting the propagation
of the electromagnetic wave.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.420
You can say that,
oh, wait, wait, wait.

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:28.340
The omega t disappeared, right?

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.770
There's no omega t here, right?

00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:33.980
But I don't really care
because everybody is actually

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:38.000
oscillating at the same
frequency, the same phase.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.670
Therefore, I factorize out.

00:10:40.670 --> 00:10:43.700
After I have done
all the calculation,

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.520
I can multiply the whole thing
by cosine omega t, and probably

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.500
some phi.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:53.998
Then that is actually modulating
and oscillating up and down

00:10:53.998 --> 00:10:59.140
as the plane wave, as
you approach the wall.

00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:03.950
So, therefore, I actually
already factorize it out.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.510
So this is actually telling
you about the electric field.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.120
And what is actually here?

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.530
This is actually the
unit area you are

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:20.110
performing this integration.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:22.470
And you can actually
do integration

00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:25.500
over the full universe.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:27.930
So you have a plane
which actually extend

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:29.820
to the whole full universe.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:32.190
But what is actually
really contributing

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.310
is defined by this f
function, which is actually

00:11:35.310 --> 00:11:37.470
the shape of the source.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:41.160
And some normalization
factor, which I don't really

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:44.430
care too much.

00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:49.760
So this looks really fancy,
but is actually not that fancy.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.910
And what product you are
getting here is our C function,

00:11:53.910 --> 00:11:58.120
is that C is actually a
function of kx and ky.

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:00.210
What is kx and ky?

00:12:00.210 --> 00:12:05.110
It's actually telling you
the direction of propagation.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.590
The k vector is actually
telling you the direction

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.970
of the propagation.

00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:18.660
If you evaluate C with a
specific given kx and ky,

00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:27.600
basically you are evaluating
the total electric field

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.640
going some direction, which is
actually defined by kx and ky.

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.320
So the big picture
is the following.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.115
So basically you
have some source.

00:12:37.115 --> 00:12:41.610
It can look like
this in the xy plane.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:44.000
This is x and y plane.

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:54.310
All those things,
all those points,

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:59.610
all those little
areas inside this hole

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:04.210
is spherical wave source.

00:13:04.210 --> 00:13:11.230
And the f function actually
define the shape of this hole.

00:13:11.230 --> 00:13:16.090
And this integration is
actually integrating over

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:19.020
all those little areas.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.030
And then calculate
the contribution

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:26.720
from each small area,
sum them together.

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:30.780
Then, finally, you are getting
something which is actually

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.760
a function of kx and ky.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:34.700
What is kx and ky?

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.480
It's actually giving you
the direction of propagation

00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:46.680
from this point-like
source to observer P.

00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:50.280
And this C function is
actually proportional

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.450
to the total electric field.

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.330
So you can see that,
hah, we have learned

00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:01.440
this Fourier transform
from the math department,

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:04.860
and we give life
to this function.

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:08.250
Now actually we understand
what we are doing now.

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:12.430
We are actually really
summing all over the,

00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:17.910
summing over the available
point-like source.

00:14:17.910 --> 00:14:21.000
And add all the contribution
of the electromagnetic wave

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.850
together.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.980
Then what we are
getting, the C function

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:34.034
is actually proportional to
the total electric field.

00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:40.060
So that is actually
the big picture.

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:43.640
Any questions so far?

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.400
I hope you can actually
understand what we are doing.

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:52.160
So now what I am going to do
is to really use this formula

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.120
and attack the problem
which we are actually

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.050
trying to understand,
the single-slit problem.

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:05.900
So suppose I have a single
slit which looks like this.

00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:12.950
I'm zooming in this thing
maybe 100 times, 1,000 times.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.725
And this is actually a wall.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.170
It's very, very long.

00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:28.894
I would like to define
first my coordinate system.

00:15:28.894 --> 00:15:32.260
The x direction, as I
actually drew from there,

00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:34.540
is actually pointing upward.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:41.560
The y direction is actually
parallel to the wall.

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.560
And the z direction
is actually going

00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.080
to where the screen
which I am trying

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:52.540
to display the outcome
of this experiment.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:56.285
And the distance
between these two walls

00:15:56.285 --> 00:16:01.380
is actually D, which is
actually given there.

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.830
So I would like to
actually understand

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:09.010
what is going to happen when
the plane waves pass through

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:12.420
with this single slit.

00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:17.520
Therefore, before I calculate
the C function proportional

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.960
to the total electric
field, what I really need

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:29.010
is a functional form, f, which
describe this single slit.

00:16:29.010 --> 00:16:33.830
And just to make sure that
everybody is on the same page,

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:40.680
this wall is actually infinitely
long, from minus infinity in y

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.570
to positive infinity y.

00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:45.870
So it's actually
a super long wall.

00:16:45.870 --> 00:16:53.010
And these two edge is
actually-- the distance

00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:57.180
between the edges is actually D.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.570
So what would be the f
function which describes

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:05.780
the shape of the light source?

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.030
f function is a
function of x and y.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:13.710
And I define a f
function, and I give you

00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:17.160
this function to describe
the experimental setup.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:21.420
So the f function can be
either 1, which actually shows

00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:24.329
that there are
point-like source there,

00:17:24.329 --> 00:17:29.150
or 0 when I am talking
about things on the wall,

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.060
because there's no
point-like source there.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:38.780
Because the wall is
actually blocking the light.

00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.130
So it can be either 1 or 0.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:43.200
When is that equal to 1?

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.460
When minus D over 2.

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:51.660
If I define-- this is
actually x equal to 0.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:56.310
The middle of the slit
is actually x equal to 0.

00:17:56.310 --> 00:18:00.780
Then it is actually equal
to 1 when minus D over 2

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:08.200
smaller than or equal to x,
smaller or equal to D over 2.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:13.710
So that will give you a slit
with width of capital D.

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:17.760
On the other hand, if
the absolute value of x

00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:22.740
is greater than D
over 2, then I get 0.

00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:24.940
So now you can see
that is actually

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.880
the meaning of f function.

00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:29.130
f function is
actually giving you

00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:34.530
a map of the point-like source.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:38.850
And what I am going to do now
is to really do the integration

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:45.180
to sum over all the spherical
electromagnetic waves coming

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:46.950
from all those
point-like source,

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:50.670
and to calculate the
total electric field.

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:55.140
So now I can go ahead and
calculate C function, which

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:59.220
is actually a function
of kx and ky, related

00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:03.390
to the direction of
propagation, or, say,

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:09.030
the relative position
of the observer

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.630
and the overall
point-like source.

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.540
And this is actually equal
to 1 over 4 pi squared,

00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.690
according to my formula.

00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:23.040
And now I'm going to do an
integration from minus infinity

00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:24.510
to infinity.

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:28.490
But I found that there's
a shortcut I can take.

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:35.160
f x y is only nonzero between
minus D over 2 and plus

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.010
D over 2 in the x direction.

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:41.260
Therefore, this integration
becomes integration

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:48.094
from minus D over 2 to
positive D over 2 dx,

00:19:48.094 --> 00:19:53.830
exponential minus i kx times x.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:20:00.990
I'm taking part of the k vector
dot r out of this formula.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:06.290
The relevant part related
to x direction integration

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:11.430
is exponential i kx times x.

00:20:11.430 --> 00:20:16.320
And now I can actually do the
integration in the y direction.

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.230
So you can see that,
in the y direction,

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:24.230
this slit is infinity
long, covering

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:27.977
the from the left-hand
side edge of the universe

00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:29.810
to the right-hand side
edge of the universe.

00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:31.650
Really long.

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:33.060
Super long.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:41.110
Minus infinity to infinity
in the y direction.

00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:45.600
The relevant part of
the exponential minus k

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:51.530
dot r is exponential
minus i ky times y.

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.470
So, before I do
this integration,

00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:04.820
I would like to remind you
one thing which is actually

00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:08.180
we have learned from the
past, from the help of math

00:21:08.180 --> 00:21:10.030
department.

00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:15.860
So we know delta function
x minus a is actually equal

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:22.950
to 1 over 2 pi, integration
from minus infinity to infinity,

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:30.950
exponential i p x minus a dp.

00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:35.890
So we know about this formula.

00:21:35.890 --> 00:21:43.180
So that means I can easily
evaluate this function.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:47.940
So this function, I'm actually
doing the integration over y.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:50.460
Therefore, what I'm
going to get is,

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:54.060
I take 1 over 2 pi out of this.

00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.610
I take 2 pi out of this.

00:21:56.610 --> 00:21:59.040
Then, basically, I
can actually arrive

00:21:59.040 --> 00:22:02.710
expression, which is
actually delta function

00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:05.520
is a function of ky.

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:10.960
After you do this integration
using this formula here.

00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:16.710
So p here is actually y in
my integration I'm doing.

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:18.880
And what I'm going
to get is actually

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.600
ky equal to 0, minus
0, and I simplify

00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:27.660
that to be delta function of ky.

00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:29.320
So basically, you
are going to get

00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:33.150
the ky contribution is going
to give you a delta function.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.490
So how about the
integration which

00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:44.590
is the other part
of the integration?

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:46.780
The other part of
the integration

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:52.660
is related to x
direction, is here.

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.090
So, basically, what
is actually left over?

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:58.750
I took already 1
over 2 pi from here.

00:22:58.750 --> 00:23:05.800
Therefore, I have 1 over 2
pi, and I do the integration.

00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:07.500
It's just a
exponential function.

00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:09.580
I'm not super worried.

00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:17.910
Basically, I get
1 over minus i kx.

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:23.470
Exponential minus i kx x.

00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:29.870
And evaluated at D over
2, x equal to D over 2,

00:23:29.870 --> 00:23:33.740
and x equal to minus D over 2.

00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:40.210
I hope this part is
straightforward enough.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:41.670
Any questions so far?

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.710
Everybody's following?

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:45.530
All right.

00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:46.490
Very good.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.620
So I will continue the red part.

00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.010
So I will just look
at the red part

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:53.280
and then continue on this board.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:56.260
I'm using the red pen, right.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.420
So, basically, what
I am going to get

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:10.790
is, basically you have 1
over 2 pi, 1 over minus i kx,

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:23.680
exponential minus i kx D over
2, minus exponential i kx D

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.270
over 2.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.770
So the red part of the
left function become this.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:33.620
And you can actually
easily realize

00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:36.740
that this is
actually proportional

00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:39.110
to a sine function, right?

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:49.750
So basically I'm going to get
1 over 2 pi minus 2i sine kx

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:58.110
D over 2, divided by i kx.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:04.210
This is actually
coming from there.

00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:06.640
And this is actually
coming from-- this minus

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:12.000
2i sine function is coming
from the exponential function

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.500
I can cancel this
2, and basically I

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:23.670
get 1 over pi kx sine
kx D divided by 2.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:31.260
So if I put everything
together, so basically

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:45.270
what you are getting is delta
function of ky, 1 over pi kx

00:25:45.270 --> 00:25:49.040
sine kx D over 2.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.990
Am I going too fast?

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:56.627
Everybody is following?

00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:02.230
So I hope this mathematics
is straightforward enough.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:05.970
And don't forget
what we are doing.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:08.530
So what we are doing
is the following.

00:26:08.530 --> 00:26:11.900
So we have this two-dimensional
Fourier transform.

00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:16.840
And the goal is to sum
over all the waves coming

00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.340
from a shape defined
by f function.

00:26:20.340 --> 00:26:22.980
And I'm going to
evaluate the C function,

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.410
and the C function
is proportional

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:29.650
to the total electric field.

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.244
C is a function of kx and ky.

00:26:33.244 --> 00:26:36.850
kx and ky give you
the information

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:41.530
about the direction,
relative position

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:48.660
of the source and the observer
P. And from this exercise,

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:50.590
what we actually
learn from here is

00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:55.810
that the C function
is a function of y,

00:26:55.810 --> 00:27:02.410
but essentially only nonzero
when ky is equal to what?

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:06.380
AUDIENCE: 0.

00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.990
PROFESSOR: 0, right?

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:10.890
Does that surprise you?

00:27:10.890 --> 00:27:12.950
No, probably not.

00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:14.300
Why is that?

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.470
Why should we expect that?

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:23.810
Because in the y direction
this slit is infinitely long.

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:30.410
So if you have contribution
of many, many spherical wave,

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.760
and this slit is
infinity long, the sum

00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:37.040
of all those spherical
wave is going

00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:40.940
to be still like a wavefront.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:43.160
You can do this in your head.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:50.690
So that means the direction,
if I choose a direction which

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:56.320
is actually pointing to
somewhere which is actually

00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.020
with a ky not equal to 0--

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.140
so that means I have
a specific direction--

00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:06.980
what I'm going to get is
that the electric field,

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.410
the total electric field,
will be equal to 0.

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:18.320
And, of course, you
can actually also

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:23.070
talk about what will
happen in the x direction.

00:28:23.070 --> 00:28:26.750
So that is actually the
dependence of the C function

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.700
to the kx.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:32.690
And we found
interesting dependence.

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:37.620
It's actually sine kx
D over 2 divided by kx.

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:45.190
So what I'm going to do is to
make our life slightly easier

00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:53.020
by defining something which is
actually easier to understand.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.270
But before that, I
would like to say

00:28:55.270 --> 00:29:00.310
that the electric field,
as I mentioned before,

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:04.860
is going to be proportional
to the C function.

00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:08.980
And now I would like to
drop the y direction,

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.270
because it's just
a delta function.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:14.150
Therefore, I can actually
drop it in the discussion.

00:29:14.150 --> 00:29:17.410
Then I will say that
this electric field

00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:25.150
is going to be proportional to
the sine kx D over 2, divided

00:29:25.150 --> 00:29:26.550
by kx.

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.230
Since we have the
electric field,

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:34.550
the magnitude of
the electric field,

00:29:34.550 --> 00:29:38.600
then I can actually calculate
what will be the intensity.

00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.880
Intensity is actually
what we care.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:44.420
It's going to be
proportional to E square,

00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:49.040
and that is actually
proportional to C square.

00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:51.310
And what is actually that value?

00:29:51.310 --> 00:29:57.920
That is going to be proportional
to sine square kx D divided

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:04.250
by 2, divided by kx squared.

00:30:04.250 --> 00:30:05.250
Any questions so far?

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:16.610
So remember what is
actually we are discussing.

00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:20.960
So we are discussing
about a single slit,

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:28.610
and we were wondering what
will happen to observer point P

00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:34.050
when they actually do get,
when these observer do get

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:39.200
the interference pattern of
all the point-like source

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.010
between these two walls.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.250
We can actually make it
much more understandable

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:50.250
by using angle,
which is actually

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:54.060
theta, which is
the measure of AP,

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.170
which is the direction of the--

00:30:58.170 --> 00:31:01.980
which is a vector connecting
the slit to the observer--

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.960
to the horizontal direction.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:09.390
And I can define the
displacement with respect

00:31:09.390 --> 00:31:13.490
to the center to be x.

00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:18.840
And I can actually
also express AP

00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.060
by a vector which is r vector.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.190
Basically, after
this definition,

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:33.800
we can actually calculate
or express sine theta.

00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:40.970
Since the distance between
the screen and the wall

00:31:40.970 --> 00:31:47.060
is very, very large, therefore
the theta angle is very small.

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:52.250
Therefore, I can safely assume
that sine theta is actually

00:31:52.250 --> 00:31:53.720
x divided by r.

00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:59.050
And also, at the same
time, this is actually

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.940
equal to kx divided by k.

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.660
Because the k vector
is actually telling you

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:12.260
the direction of propagation.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:14.790
So, therefore, I can
actually rewrite this.

00:32:14.790 --> 00:32:18.780
This will become kx.

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:23.270
The magnitude of k
vector is actually

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:25.760
basically 2 pi over lambda.

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:28.330
So, therefore, you can
actually calculate that,

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:35.010
and you will get kx times
lambda divided by 2 pi.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.850
Therefore, the goal
is to rewrite kx

00:32:38.850 --> 00:32:42.660
in a form which we
understand, which is theta.

00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.960
So now we have achieved that.

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.593
What is actually kx?

00:32:46.593 --> 00:32:54.070
kx is actually equal to 2 pi
sine theta divided by lambda.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:04.940
And this means that
my intensity, which

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:13.401
I appended there, will be
proportional to sine square pi

00:33:13.401 --> 00:33:21.995
D divided by lambda sine
theta, divided by 2 pi sine

00:33:21.995 --> 00:33:26.300
theta divided by
lambda, squared.

00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:31.440
So basically what I'm doing
is to replace kx and then

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:35.660
write it in terms of theta.

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:44.090
If I define beta to be
equal to pi D sine theta

00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:49.610
over lambda, if I define
this, basically you

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:54.290
are getting sine
square beta, this

00:33:54.290 --> 00:33:57.670
will be proportional to
sine squared beta divided

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:01.070
by beta squared.

00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:09.830
And this beta is actually
proportional to theta and D.

00:34:09.830 --> 00:34:12.000
Any questions so far?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.239
I'm just doing a replace, I'm
just replacing the variables

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.060
so that it's actually
in terms of theta

00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.594
and in terms of some variable
which actually simplify

00:34:23.594 --> 00:34:25.870
the expression dramatically.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.130
So, that's very good.

00:34:31.130 --> 00:34:37.090
So we have actually
evaluated the intensity,

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:44.719
the resulting intensity which
will show up on the screen.

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:46.310
And then we found
that essentially

00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:51.690
proportional to sine square pi
D divided by lambda sine theta,

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:53.659
divided by something squared.

00:34:53.659 --> 00:34:56.560
And then I called
this constant, sorry,

00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:00.110
I called this expression,
I defined this expression

00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:01.310
to be beta.

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:04.340
Then the functional form
become much simpler.

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:07.460
It's become sine square
beta divided by beta square.

00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:17.330
So what I am going to do now
is to visualize this result.

00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:24.050
So what I'm trying to do
now is to plot the intensity

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:30.290
I as a function of sine
theta, for example, using

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:32.610
this expression.

00:35:32.610 --> 00:35:35.960
So what I'm going to get is
something which is actually

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:39.830
going to be decreasing.

00:35:39.830 --> 00:35:41.720
Something is going
to be decreasing

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.640
as a function of beta.

00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.740
So that's the dashed line.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:49.460
This dashed line is
actually proportional to 1

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.990
over beta squared.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:00.810
And sine theta very
small, you actually

00:36:00.810 --> 00:36:03.630
reach a maximum value of I0.

00:36:06.630 --> 00:36:14.460
When you move away
from theta equal to 0,

00:36:14.460 --> 00:36:20.460
you actually will hit a
minimum when the sine theta

00:36:20.460 --> 00:36:27.790
is equal to lambda over D.
Because if sine theta is

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:33.200
equal to lambda over D, then
this expression become what?

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.860
Become what value when
sine theta is actually

00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:36.550
lambda over D?

00:36:39.590 --> 00:36:40.540
Pi.

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.130
Sine pi is 0, right?

00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:49.160
Therefore, you have a
destructive interference.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.830
This point is
really interesting.

00:36:50.830 --> 00:36:52.070
Why?

00:36:52.070 --> 00:36:57.430
Because that means all
the point-like source,

00:36:57.430 --> 00:37:02.120
all of them between
these two walls,

00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:09.480
are working together so nicely
such that the total field is

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.270
completely cancelled.

00:37:12.270 --> 00:37:14.290
Isn't that remarkable?

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:19.070
That's really, really
crazy when this happens.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:22.970
Takes a lot of work, infinite
number of source, to do that.

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.960
Then, if you actually increase
further the sine theta,

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:32.090
move away from the
center of the screen,

00:37:32.090 --> 00:37:35.930
basically you see that this
will increase again and reach

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:41.960
a smaller maxima,
and again reach 0

00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:46.340
when this is actually
equal to 2 lambda over D.

00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:48.530
And this pattern continues.

00:37:48.530 --> 00:37:53.740
And, of course,
because of the symmetry

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:56.780
we observe in this
expression, everything

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.950
is actually proportional
to sine squared something.

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:04.720
Therefore, this distribution
is actually symmetric.

00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:09.430
So you have minus lambda over
D, minus 2 lambda over D,

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:12.915
et cetera, et cetera.

00:38:12.915 --> 00:38:14.400
Any questions so far?

00:38:20.340 --> 00:38:26.620
So what you can see here is
something really interesting.

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:30.880
Sine theta, if you
multiply that by r,

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:36.620
is telling you
the position which

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.470
you will see on the screen.

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:41.360
So this is actually--

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:45.660
if you are interested in some
place, point of interest P,

00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:50.570
and this actually just
r times sine theta.

00:38:50.570 --> 00:38:52.310
And this is actually the slit.

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.580
And I will move this
thing closer here.

00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:04.360
And the size of this
slit is called D.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:07.990
So one thing which is actually
very interesting in this result

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:18.080
is that, if we look at the
width of the central principal

00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.780
maxima.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:21.770
The width is
actually the measure

00:39:21.770 --> 00:39:24.610
between the center
and the first minima,

00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:29.430
where you have complete
destructive interference.

00:39:29.430 --> 00:39:34.600
What you actually see here is
that this is actually something

00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:35.860
very interesting is happening.

00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.260
When you increase
D, if you increase

00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:42.400
D, what is going to
happen to the position

00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:46.590
of the first principal
minima, of our first minima?

00:39:46.590 --> 00:39:49.800
It's going to what?

00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.360
Going to become smaller.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:54.370
Right?

00:39:54.370 --> 00:40:01.180
So suppose I have a gap here and
I'm shooting a gun like crazy,

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:03.250
boo-boo-boo-boo boo-boo-boo-boo.

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:10.090
And I produce huge amount
of bullet, which I don't

00:40:10.090 --> 00:40:13.960
recommend to do that, for sure.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.140
What I'm going to do,
what I'm going to get

00:40:16.140 --> 00:40:21.230
is a distribution like this,
which are the bullets passing

00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.630
through this wall.

00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:27.230
If I increase the
size of the wall,

00:40:27.230 --> 00:40:31.150
the distribution I'm
getting is becoming what?

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.490
Wider.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:33.290
Right?

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:36.200
But the result here is
actually surprising.

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.030
Why?

00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:43.020
When you increase
the width, when

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:48.360
you increase the width of the D,
this function becomes smaller.

00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:53.240
That means the central
maxima will become narrower,

00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:56.680
as you can see from
this demonstration.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.170
So the left-hand side is an
experimental setup which you

00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:05.010
have a very, very narrow slit.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:09.120
And basically you get a
very wide distribution

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:15.600
in the intensity as a function
of position on the screen.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.800
Right-hand side is
another situation where

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.640
you have wider distribution.

00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:26.220
I'm sorry, wider
slit, and you are

00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:29.950
going to get a narrower
central maxima.

00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:34.950
Which is actually different
from the other experiment

00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:39.000
which we were actually doing.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.900
So that's the first thing
which we learn from here.

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.650
And, also, the
distance, the distance

00:41:46.650 --> 00:41:52.920
between the maxima
and the minima

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:56.430
is proportional to wavelength.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:42:01.230
So that means I can
measure wavelength

00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:05.340
by using the position
of the minima.

00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:10.020
And we are going to do that
to measure the wavelength

00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.210
of the laser beam.

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:15.330
And, finally, the last
thing which we learn

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:23.280
is that, in the central region,
you have a maxima of I0,

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:27.570
and this intensity is
going to be going down,

00:42:27.570 --> 00:42:31.950
proportional to 1 over beta
squared, where beta is actually

00:42:31.950 --> 00:42:32.670
defined here.

00:42:32.670 --> 00:42:35.340
It's proportional
to D sine theta

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:41.500
and inversely proportional
to wavelength.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:48.190
So now what I'm going
to do is experiment

00:42:48.190 --> 00:42:51.040
which I would like
to measure what would

00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:55.510
be the wavelength of my laser.

00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:58.040
So I have a laser here.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:42:58.540
Oh.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:01.720
OK, I don't want
to hurt anybody.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:04.300
So I have a laser here.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:08.770
And I have a slit, which you
cannot see, unfortunately.

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:11.780
And I can read off the
width of the slit for you.

00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.020
The width of the
slit is carefully

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:21.620
designed to be really
small, is 0.16 millimeter.

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:23.900
This is my width.

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:30.800
The D is actually equal
to 0.16 millimeter.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:36.440
And on the screen, you can see
that there's a pattern formed

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:40.220
here, which you probably
cannot see very, very clearly,

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:46.450
so I will try to lower the
intensity of the other source.

00:43:46.450 --> 00:43:49.450
So you can see,
then, see that there

00:43:49.450 --> 00:43:53.840
is an interference pattern
or diffraction pattern which

00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:54.920
is actually showing here.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:05.660
So what I really need in order
to calculate the wavelength

00:44:05.660 --> 00:44:08.450
is the sine theta angle.

00:44:08.450 --> 00:44:10.370
Which I will really need
the sine theta angle.

00:44:10.370 --> 00:44:11.786
Then I can actually
calculate what

00:44:11.786 --> 00:44:15.110
will be the wavelength
of this laser.

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:19.580
So that means I will need
help from a volunteer.

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.370
Who volunteer to
help me to measure

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:26.090
the distance between this
slit and the large screen?

00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.590
Can somebody volunteer?

00:44:27.590 --> 00:44:28.210
Yes, please.

00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:36.220
So we are going to
measure the distance.

00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:36.970
Can you hold this?

00:44:36.970 --> 00:44:39.720
And can you actually put it?

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:43.330
OK, try to pull this thing,
and we will try our best

00:44:43.330 --> 00:44:47.330
to make it straight.

00:44:47.330 --> 00:44:50.130
Thank you very much.

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:52.345
We don't want to destroy
the experiment as well.

00:44:56.360 --> 00:44:57.360
This is not working?

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:02.790
Let me do this in the other way.

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.310
So how about-- trial
and error, right?

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:10.240
How about this.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:14.690
You hold that thing, and I'm
going to actually measure

00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:16.036
the distance from here.

00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:24.520
And I need to really make it
really carefully, measure this

00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.810
very carefully.

00:45:25.810 --> 00:45:29.890
And I don't want to
destroy anything,

00:45:29.890 --> 00:45:30.980
which is very possible.

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:37.670
So what I'm getting?

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:42.230
I get 7.5 meter.

00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:47.720
So that's actually the distance
between the screen, the screen

00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:49.260
and the source.

00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.600
Hold that for a second.

00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:55.820
I am going to measure the width
of, the distance between two

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:56.750
minima.

00:45:56.750 --> 00:46:04.170
The distance between two
minima is 7 centimeter.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:06.490
Thank you very much.

00:46:06.490 --> 00:46:08.620
Thank you for your help.

00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:12.170
So we have now
everything we need

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:14.070
to calculate the wavelength.

00:46:17.276 --> 00:46:19.200
I'm going to clean
this up first.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:27.560
We have what?

00:46:27.560 --> 00:46:29.290
We have the distance now.

00:46:29.290 --> 00:46:34.970
The distance between the source
and the screen is 7.6 meter.

00:46:38.190 --> 00:46:41.860
So now I would like to calculate
what will be the lambda.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:47.600
And also I know the distance--

00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:55.830
the distance between these
two minima is 7 centimeter.

00:46:55.830 --> 00:47:01.303
So that means this
will be 3.5 centimeter.

00:47:04.270 --> 00:47:10.770
So lambda divided by D is
actually equal to sine theta.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:17.040
Which is actually small
d, which is the distance

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.225
between the minima.

00:47:18.225 --> 00:47:20.550
The small d is here.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:24.860
The small d is the
distance between the minima

00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:26.580
and the center.

00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:31.190
Divided by r, which is the
distance between the source

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:33.620
and the screen.

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.300
Therefore, I can
have lambda will

00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:42.800
be equal to capital D
times small d divided by r.

00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:44.450
So what is actually the answer?

00:47:44.450 --> 00:47:48.140
So basically I have
capital D, which

00:47:48.140 --> 00:47:53.420
is actually 0.16 millimeter.

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:57.080
So that is actually shown
there but you cannot see it.

00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:05.750
So I will use a different
board for this calculation.

00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:09.710
So, basically, we
will actually get

00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:17.825
lambda is equal to capital D
times small d divided by r.

00:48:17.825 --> 00:48:24.120
Capital D is 0.16 times
10 to the minus 3 meter.

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:29.780
And what is actually
the small d?

00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:34.834
The small d is actually
3.5 centimeters.

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:48.030
And, finally, I have 7.6 meter,
which is actually the small r.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:51.220
Divided by 7.6 meter.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:58.180
Can somebody actually
calculate this for me?

00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:02.460
Anybody have a smartphone?

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:10.480
This means that I haven't
done this experiment myself,

00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:12.830
and we will see what
is going to happen.

00:49:12.830 --> 00:49:13.700
I hope it will work.

00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:20.337
What is actually the value?

00:49:20.337 --> 00:49:24.330
AUDIENCE: 7.368 times
10 to the negative 7.

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:29.330
PROFESSOR: 7.368 times
10 to the minus 7.

00:49:29.330 --> 00:49:34.280
This is actually equal
to 7.37 times 10--

00:49:34.280 --> 00:49:34.790
oh, wait.

00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:40.050
This is actually 737 nanometer.

00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:43.880
Actually, the
wavelength of the red

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:48.180
is actually between 620 and 750.

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:51.791
And actually we are actually
getting the correct value.

00:49:51.791 --> 00:49:52.290
You see?

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:55.770
So, actually, now you can
actually tell your friends

00:49:55.770 --> 00:49:59.400
that, although the
wavelength is so small,

00:49:59.400 --> 00:50:04.490
but I can't measure it
with such a square feet

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:07.700
experimental setup.

00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.220
So that's a
successful experiment.

00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:12.550
So that is actually
telling you that it's

00:50:12.550 --> 00:50:16.400
a proof that this
formula, which we actually

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.110
do all the crazy
work of this Fourier

00:50:19.110 --> 00:50:22.355
transform in
two-dimensional integration,

00:50:22.355 --> 00:50:24.470
it should really work.

00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:29.750
And the result is actually
not really far from what

00:50:29.750 --> 00:50:33.770
you can get from Wikipedia.

00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:37.190
So, at this point, I would like
to take a five-minute break

00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:38.750
to take some questions.

00:50:38.750 --> 00:50:43.790
And then we are going
to come back in, at 31,

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:47.340
and we are going to discuss
another very interesting issue,

00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.471
resolution.

00:50:53.770 --> 00:50:55.540
So welcome back.

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:59.680
So there are a few
questions about--

00:51:02.590 --> 00:51:08.420
there were a few questions
about the pattern here,

00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:09.790
which is interesting.

00:51:09.790 --> 00:51:12.970
So you can see that what we
actually concluded from here

00:51:12.970 --> 00:51:18.700
is that the width of the
central principal maxima

00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:23.950
is actually two times of the
width of the secondary maxima.

00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:27.330
So you can see that the width
here between these two points

00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:31.840
is actually lambda over D. But
the width between these two

00:51:31.840 --> 00:51:34.070
points, which actually
give you the width

00:51:34.070 --> 00:51:38.690
of the central principal
maxima, is actually 2 times

00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:40.900
of lambda over D.

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.190
And now this actually can be
seen from the experiment there.

00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:47.090
Maybe not easy for the moment.

00:51:47.090 --> 00:51:50.340
But this is actually the width,
and the smaller structure

00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:58.090
is actually having a width
half of the central peak.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:00.950
So that is actually something
which is interesting,

00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:04.550
and I would like to share
that with everybody.

00:52:04.550 --> 00:52:07.870
So now we actually come back
to the original question

00:52:07.870 --> 00:52:11.800
we were actually
discussing last time.

00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.960
So one interesting
thing we observed

00:52:13.960 --> 00:52:17.770
in this two-slit
interference experiment

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:22.330
is that you not only see all
those little structures, which

00:52:22.330 --> 00:52:24.850
is actually kind of
periodic structure,

00:52:24.850 --> 00:52:28.300
and that they are coming from
the two-slit interference.

00:52:28.300 --> 00:52:31.000
And you also see
this larger structure

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.750
which is showing up there, which
is actually going up and down,

00:52:34.750 --> 00:52:38.530
and also it produce minima
at some specific point.

00:52:38.530 --> 00:52:42.890
Now we understand what
is actually happening.

00:52:42.890 --> 00:52:49.960
Suppose I have two-slit
interference experiment, where

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:57.200
I have the width of the slits to
be capital D, to be very small.

00:52:57.200 --> 00:52:59.185
D is very, very small.

00:53:01.890 --> 00:53:04.500
And the distance
between the slit

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:06.460
is actually called small d.

00:53:06.460 --> 00:53:09.870
Which is kind of
weird, but you have

00:53:09.870 --> 00:53:13.260
to accept that because
it's on my note.

00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:15.830
And you can see
that, interestingly,

00:53:15.830 --> 00:53:21.240
if this is the situation, then
you have this periodic pattern

00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:25.630
and you will see no
decrease in amplitude

00:53:25.630 --> 00:53:30.150
as a function of distance with
respect to the central point

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:33.390
of the screen.

00:53:33.390 --> 00:53:35.490
So that's actually very nice.

00:53:35.490 --> 00:53:42.570
However, if you consider
a realistic situation,

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:50.360
where the size, or say the width
of the slit is not negligible,

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:52.040
is sizable.

00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.710
And what is going
to happen is that--

00:53:54.710 --> 00:54:00.170
OK, let's forget about the
second one for a moment.

00:54:00.170 --> 00:54:05.060
We already learned that
the output intensity

00:54:05.060 --> 00:54:10.250
of a single slit is already
varying as a function of angle.

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:12.300
So I have this pattern.

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:20.570
Therefore, if you have these
two realistic slit interacting

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:23.570
with each other, have
interference pattern,

00:54:23.570 --> 00:54:29.120
what you are going to
expect is that you are going

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:35.810
to have the two-slit
interference pattern modulated

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:39.670
by diffraction pattern.

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:42.850
Because, originally,
coming from a single slit,

00:54:42.850 --> 00:54:47.740
you already have a
varying intensity

00:54:47.740 --> 00:54:54.500
as a function of sine theta,
as we already discussed there.

00:54:54.500 --> 00:55:00.130
So, if we put all those
information together,

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:03.940
we are going to get I.
The intensity is going

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:13.390
to be equal to I0, which is
some maxima, sine beta divided

00:55:13.390 --> 00:55:22.790
by beta, square of that,
sine N delta divided by 2,

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:29.610
divided by sine delta
divided by 2, squared.

00:55:29.610 --> 00:55:32.130
So basically what
I'm talking about

00:55:32.130 --> 00:55:36.210
is that, if you have
N-slit experiment,

00:55:36.210 --> 00:55:40.950
each slit have the same width.

00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:42.540
And what you are
going to get is--

00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:47.720
this is actually the N-slit
interference pattern.

00:55:56.510 --> 00:56:05.288
And that is actually modulated
by diffraction pattern.

00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:13.760
Where beta, just a
reminder, in this summary

00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:19.850
is pi capital D divided
by lambda sine theta.

00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:22.700
And the delta, which is
the optical path length

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:28.880
difference we defined before,
is k times d sine theta,

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:35.160
and that is actually equal
to 2 pi times d sine theta

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:38.390
divided by lambda.

00:56:38.390 --> 00:56:42.290
So that is actually
why, when we perform

00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:50.510
the experiment of a double-slit
experiment in the last lecture,

00:56:50.510 --> 00:56:55.520
we get complicated
interference pattern like this,

00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:58.400
and it has a very
complicated structure.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:02.340
And now we actually understand
why the structure is like this.

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:06.710
The small structure in
this case is actually

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:10.970
coming from interference,
two-slit interference.

00:57:10.970 --> 00:57:15.270
And the additional structure,
larger-scale structure,

00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:18.300
is actually coming
from diffraction,

00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:22.350
is coming from the varying
intensity of a single slit

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:26.180
as a function of sine theta.

00:57:26.180 --> 00:57:27.180
Any questions so far?

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.500
We are making a lot of progress.

00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:36.710
So what I would
like to move on is

00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:39.390
to discuss with you
something really interesting.

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:48.590
So we discussed and learned how
to explain why we have actually

00:57:48.590 --> 00:57:52.130
colorful soap bubble.

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:55.100
So I have something
totally unrelated.

00:57:55.100 --> 00:58:00.160
So we have a soap bubble
also in the space, which

00:58:00.160 --> 00:58:03.500
is the Soap Bubble nebula.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:05.720
Which is really interesting,
and you can actually

00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:08.580
Google it and see what is
actually happening there.

00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:11.290
But, actually, that's
actually not my point.

00:58:11.290 --> 00:58:16.340
Then my point is that you
really need very good resolution

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:21.050
telescope so that you can
actually observe those really

00:58:21.050 --> 00:58:26.030
beautiful objects which are
already there and cannot be

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:28.250
made by human.

00:58:28.250 --> 00:58:29.450
Made by somebody else.

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:36.840
So this is actually
what I'm getting into.

00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:41.220
So the resolution is
really something important.

00:58:41.220 --> 00:58:45.000
So when you take a
look at this picture,

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.670
the resolution is not very good.

00:58:47.670 --> 00:58:52.470
So as you can see, now the peak
position of two nearby peak

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:55.060
is actually connecting
to each other.

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:58.370
Then what do we see
from this picture?

00:58:58.370 --> 00:59:00.320
You see maybe a lion?

00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.190
I don't know.

00:59:01.190 --> 00:59:04.010
Maybe, maybe not.

00:59:04.010 --> 00:59:10.000
But if you improve the
resolution, what do you see?

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.800
It's actually zebra.

00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:14.750
So this is actually
the kind of thing

00:59:14.750 --> 00:59:18.590
which we would like
to discuss with you.

00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:22.790
We are actually touching
this important phenomenon,

00:59:22.790 --> 00:59:25.475
which is actually
needed for observing

00:59:25.475 --> 00:59:31.850
an interesting phenomena which
is actually happening really

00:59:31.850 --> 00:59:35.600
far away from the Earth.

00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:39.480
What is actually the resolution?

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.740
And we are going to
talk about that as well.

00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:46.120
And I would like to show you
another interesting example.

00:59:46.120 --> 00:59:52.200
So this is a comparison
between not so serious picture

00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:55.440
and the picture from
Hubble telescope.

00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:01.360
So I was using some telescope
with D equal to 40 centimeter.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:02.850
And that's actually
the best thing

01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:09.720
which I can achieve, shooting
the same planetary nebula M57.

01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:13.650
That object is actually
2,500 light year away.

01:00:13.650 --> 01:00:17.490
And you can see that I cannot
get really a lot of detail from

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:19.350
this image.

01:00:19.350 --> 01:00:23.310
And now, if you
compare that to D equal

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:27.810
to 240 centimeter
Hubble telescope,

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:29.400
and also, at the
same time, this thing

01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:33.324
is actually above
the atmosphere.

01:00:33.324 --> 01:00:34.990
So that's actually
very, very important.

01:00:34.990 --> 01:00:39.430
And you can see that you do get
a much, much better resolution,

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:43.090
and you can actually see all
the fine detail, very, very

01:00:43.090 --> 01:00:46.690
fine detail of this image.

01:00:46.690 --> 01:00:50.630
And we are in the
position to understand

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:59.075
the resolution and the
limit which we can have

01:00:59.075 --> 01:01:01.540
due to diffraction, actually.

01:01:01.540 --> 01:01:12.220
So if I consider now a
pinhole with diameter equal

01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:18.170
to D. So right now what
we are actually doing

01:01:18.170 --> 01:01:24.250
is not a single slit any
more, but a hole with radius

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:27.220
D over 2.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:34.150
And we can do the same,
exactly the same calculation

01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:36.220
using this formula.

01:01:36.220 --> 01:01:39.800
But I'm not going to do
that for the sake of time.

01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:44.680
So we can do exactly that
same C function calculation.

01:01:44.680 --> 01:01:50.920
And what we are going to get
is I as a function of theta

01:01:50.920 --> 01:02:01.120
is equal to I0 J1 beta
divided by beta, squared.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:07.870
Where J1 is the Bessel
function of the first kind.

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:11.200
Sounds really scary,
but it's actually not.

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:20.440
So what I really need is the
zeros of the Bessel function,

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.160
so that I can actually
extract the interference

01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:29.170
pattern and the width
of the central maximum.

01:02:29.170 --> 01:02:31.880
So now, since we are
having a pinhole,

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.940
basically all of
those things are,

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:37.720
all those patterns are
actually two-dimensional.

01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:46.660
And I was wondering what will be
the needed beta value so that I

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:50.490
can actually reach the minima.

01:02:50.490 --> 01:02:52.610
Why is that important?

01:02:52.610 --> 01:02:55.800
That is actually
telling you the limit

01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.810
of the optical resolution.

01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:02.780
If I have two peaks
which are actually

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:06.960
placed too close to each
other, like what we actually

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.000
see in the previous
slide, then we

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:15.510
can actually not separate very
well these two light source.

01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:19.590
On the other hand, if the
distance between these two peak

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:23.430
is larger than the
first minima, then I

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:25.221
can actually be very safe.

01:03:25.221 --> 01:03:26.220
I can actually separate.

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:28.770
I can say that, ha, this
is really two peaks.

01:03:28.770 --> 01:03:31.080
Two stars, two light source.

01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.200
I can tell.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:36.060
So that is actually why
this is actually important.

01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:39.750
And where is
actually the minima?

01:03:39.750 --> 01:03:42.990
And I can already
solve that for you.

01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:47.130
And that is actually when
x is equal to roughly,

01:03:47.130 --> 01:03:53.790
the numerical value
is roughly 3.83.

01:03:53.790 --> 01:03:55.290
So that's actually
not important.

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.180
Those numbers are not important.

01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:01.210
The important result is
really the conclusion.

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:06.810
So beta is equal to 3.83,
and that is actually

01:04:06.810 --> 01:04:13.470
equal to pi D sine
theta divided by lambda.

01:04:13.470 --> 01:04:16.280
So that is actually our
original definition.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:21.390
And I can solve what will be the
sine theta, which is actually

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:25.560
telling you the
position of the minima.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:33.580
So sine theta will be equal to
actually 1.22 lambda divided

01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:36.290
by D.

01:04:36.290 --> 01:04:38.040
So what does that mean?

01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.160
That means the position where
you have the first minima

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.610
is actually happening
when you have sine theta--

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.250
this is the theta--

01:04:54.250 --> 01:04:58.980
when you have sine theta equal
to 1.22 times lambda divided

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:04.280
by D.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.130
So that is actually very nice.

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:09.830
Doing exactly the same
exercise, and we now

01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:14.680
understand where my minima is.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:16.790
Then that is
actually telling you

01:05:16.790 --> 01:05:19.994
something about the resolution.

01:05:26.910 --> 01:05:29.480
So what I'm going
to try to get into

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.910
is that, now, let's design a
phone together, a mobile phone

01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:36.470
together.

01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:41.820
So what is actually the
width of the human pupil?

01:05:44.780 --> 01:05:49.410
The width is actually
roughly 2 to 4 millimeter--

01:05:49.410 --> 01:05:54.480
when narrow, when you see a lot
of light all over the place--

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:58.000
or 3 to 8 millimeter.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:03.860
So that is actually the
typical length when wide.

01:06:03.860 --> 01:06:06.910
So that is actually the
width of the pinhole.

01:06:09.590 --> 01:06:14.960
So, typically, the visible
light, as we calculated,

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:18.610
is something like 500 nanometer.

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:25.940
And the width of
the human pupil, we

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:31.430
can actually take a
number of 5 millimeter.

01:06:31.430 --> 01:06:37.700
And now we can actually try to
give input to the phone design.

01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:42.650
So what will be the resolution
if we take these two

01:06:42.650 --> 01:06:44.510
parameter together?

01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:47.750
So, basically, the
resolution of your eye, we

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:49.910
can now calculate that.

01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:51.520
So what is that?

01:06:51.520 --> 01:07:01.540
That is actually 1.22 times
500 nanometer divided by--

01:07:01.540 --> 01:07:03.890
OK, my function is D--

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.980
so divided by D is
equal to 5 millimeter.

01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:10.700
5 millimeter.

01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.070
Basically, what you
are going to get

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:17.900
is 1.22 times 10 to the minus 4.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.080
This is actually the resolution.

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:23.670
Sine theta, roughly
equal to theta,

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:28.430
is actually equal to 1.22
times 10 to the minus 4.

01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:40.240
I have a iPhone 6 or
7, whatever you have.

01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:44.850
Basically is 401 ppi.

01:07:44.850 --> 01:07:48.280
401 ppi is actually
what is that?

01:07:48.280 --> 01:07:51.250
Pixel per inch.

01:07:51.250 --> 01:07:53.200
So what is actually the delta x?

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:57.680
So if I have a phone, OK,
it has a camera there.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:08:00.640
That is my phone.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:03.010
And this is my eye.

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:05.740
Looks like an eye.

01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:09.670
The distance is 20 centimeter.

01:08:09.670 --> 01:08:11.500
I do this, which is unusual.

01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.850
We have 400 ppi.

01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:24.189
So what is actually the delta x,
the delta x between the pixels?

01:08:24.189 --> 01:08:32.109
The delta x is equal to 2.54
centimeter divided by 401,

01:08:32.109 --> 01:08:36.220
and that will give you
something like 6.3 times 10

01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:38.098
to the minus 3 centimeter.

01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:45.930
If I am trying to be
healthy and I do this, then

01:08:45.930 --> 01:08:47.649
what is actually
the delta theta?

01:08:47.649 --> 01:08:52.540
The delta theta is delta x
divided by 20 centimeter,

01:08:52.540 --> 01:08:55.660
and that is 3 times
10 to be minus 4.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:04.939
If you compare this
value to the limit

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:11.090
I calculated here, you can see
that, what is the conclusion?

01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:16.010
Can I resolve the
pixels on the phone?

01:09:16.010 --> 01:09:19.640
The answer is yes.

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.950
So that means this phone
is not good enough.

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.080
They have to do more work.

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:29.689
And now I'm going
to design a jPhone.

01:09:34.330 --> 01:09:38.630
Maybe at some point
I got really crazy

01:09:38.630 --> 01:09:41.779
and I decided to
open a company, which

01:09:41.779 --> 01:09:44.450
is Yen-Jie's phone company.

01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:50.990
And, of course, I will say this
is jPhone because it's Yen-Jie.

01:09:50.990 --> 01:10:01.600
And I'm going to put
40,000 ppi in this phone.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.424
Will you buy it?

01:10:03.424 --> 01:10:03.965
AUDIENCE: No.

01:10:03.965 --> 01:10:04.590
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:10:04.590 --> 01:10:05.950
AUDIENCE: How much?

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:07.257
PROFESSOR: $1.

01:10:07.257 --> 01:10:07.840
You'll buy it?

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:10.440
We'll see.

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:14.760
Maybe you will buy it
because you are my student.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.420
But it's not worth it.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.080
Why is that?

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:26.520
Because you cannot resolve this
kind of fine or small distance

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:27.780
between pixels.

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:29.850
So it's actually useless.

01:10:29.850 --> 01:10:31.100
So what is actually the limit?

01:10:31.100 --> 01:10:34.590
You can also probably
give that to your friends.

01:10:34.590 --> 01:10:40.720
2,000 pixel per inch
is roughly the limit.

01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.140
Beyond that, maybe the next
generation of our students

01:10:46.140 --> 01:10:49.790
will be using this like this.

01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:52.580
Then it works, and
it is worth it.

01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:56.230
You can actually
read this distance.

01:10:56.230 --> 01:11:00.980
It doesn't work for old people
like me, but for young people

01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:03.260
it works.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.340
So very good.

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.800
So that's another thing
which you have learned.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:10.670
So, finally, as I
promised you, we

01:11:10.670 --> 01:11:15.650
are going to go back to
this business of designing

01:11:15.650 --> 01:11:18.860
the Enterprise for Star Trek.

01:11:18.860 --> 01:11:22.770
So what does Enterprise
do to their friends?

01:11:22.770 --> 01:11:26.120
They shoot laser beam.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:29.780
And they try to attack
the other ships.

01:11:29.780 --> 01:11:33.836
And what I'm going to do
now is to calculate for you

01:11:33.836 --> 01:11:35.294
what is going to happen.

01:11:35.294 --> 01:11:38.700
OK, now I have this
laser beam here.

01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:41.690
And, in principle,
before you take 8.03,

01:11:41.690 --> 01:11:47.010
you are going to say,
aha, I can shoot the moon.

01:11:47.010 --> 01:11:50.360
And this light is going
to be really narrow

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:53.800
and it's going to hit the moon,
a very small area on the moon.

01:11:56.930 --> 01:11:59.750
Do you believe that now?

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:02.780
I hope the answer is not.

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:05.660
How crazy is this idea?

01:12:05.660 --> 01:12:07.950
What is the size of the spot?

01:12:07.950 --> 01:12:09.560
Can you guess?

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.980
Is that 1 millimeter?

01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:15.500
10 meter?

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:18.880
Or 200 kilometer?

01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:23.860
How many of you think
by now is 1 millimeter?

01:12:23.860 --> 01:12:24.980
Nobody?

01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.830
Fortunately.

01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:30.330
How about 10 meter?

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:34.660
One, two, three.

01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:35.320
OK.

01:12:35.320 --> 01:12:36.490
Three of you.

01:12:36.490 --> 01:12:39.305
How about 200 kilometer?

01:12:39.305 --> 01:12:41.100
You believe that?

01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:42.980
Really?

01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:49.680
The answer is really
200 kilometer.

01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:53.130
It's the size of Missouri state.

01:12:56.590 --> 01:13:00.310
So now you can see that this
is not practical at all,

01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:04.120
and you have to really do what?

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.216
Increase or decrease the radius?

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.070
AUDIENCE: Increase.

01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:09.960
PROFESSOR: Increase.

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.490
By the end of this lecture
everybody get this idea.

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:18.820
Thank you very much
for the attention.

01:13:18.820 --> 01:13:21.800
And I hope you
enjoyed this lecture.

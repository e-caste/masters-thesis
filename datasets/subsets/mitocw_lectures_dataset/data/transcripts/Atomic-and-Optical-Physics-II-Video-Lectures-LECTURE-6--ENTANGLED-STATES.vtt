00:00:25.224 --> 00:00:26.890
PROFESSOR: So good
afternoon, everybody.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.230
You see the topic
for today's class

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.730
on the screen--
entangled photons.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.220
Just to remind
you, when we talked

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.930
about single photons and
Mach-Zender interferometers,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.690
we realized that when we have a
nonlinear interferometer where

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:56.710
one mode, you can say one
beam, affects the phase shift

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.850
in the interferometer
for the other photon.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.780
Then we get a
nonlinear situation,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.130
and we can create photon states
which no longer factorize.

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.570
So we have a system
a, a system b,

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.180
and we can no longer write
down the total wave function

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.650
in a wave function for
system a times system b.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.660
And this is something
very interesting,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.520
and this is what we
feature in this section.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:36.450
So we finished the last class
by defining entanglement.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.500
And just to remind you, we
said something is entangled

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.240
if it is impossible to write
it in a product of two wave

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.890
functions.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.750
So therefore, if you have some
correlation between the two

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.840
systems, then we
call the two systems

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.270
and the state of the
system entangled.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.100
Now this is a definition
which needs explanation,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.430
so we went through
some examples.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:18.510
And we showed that certain
states which on first sight

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.760
look entangled
are not entangled,

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.780
because if you try
harder, you find

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.950
the way to factorize the state.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.960
So I want to continue
now in explaining

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.670
different aspects
of the definition,

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.140
in particular what it means
to have a system which

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.440
has two subsystems, a and b.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.870
Before I do that, do you have
any questions up to that point?

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.345
So we want to talk about some
standard entangled state.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.990
And the most basic
state is a single state.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:49.450
So if you have a state which
is 0 1 minus 1 0 normalized,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.040
this is an
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen state.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.920
This needs some explanation.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.410
We have often
encountered, in physics,

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.230
states which are simply
a superposition of if you

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:14.820
interpret 0 1 as
spin up or spin down,

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.430
you encounter that quite often.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.649
And I want to explain
to you now what

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:25.730
is not an entangled state
for the reasons of using

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.920
entanglement as a resource.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.370
So first of all, I
want to point out

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:43.430
this state is not
a single photon,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.420
because we have entangled
here two qubits.

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.990
Let me just contrast it.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:05:01.360
If you have a single
photon after beam splitter,

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.890
the single photon
after beam splitter

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:13.430
is in a superposition of
mode a, mode b, 0 1 minus 1 0

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.270
divided by square root 2.

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:22.040
But now 0 is the vacuum.

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.470
So we have not a
system which can

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.230
be decomposed into two
partial systems a and b.

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.310
You may even separate the
system and then manipulate

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.240
your single qubits individually
by putting phase shifts on

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.790
and doing other operations.

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.240
If you have this state which is
a superposition between having

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.930
a photon, not having a vacuum,
and having a vacuum state,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:54.850
you cannot-- the vacuum state
itself is not a separate

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.350
system.

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:58.260
You cannot take the vacuum
and perform operations

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.400
on the vacuum.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.060
So I know it has
been confusing for me

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.040
when I heard about it
for the first time.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.490
We have, so to speak,
here an entangled mode,

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.940
but not an entangled state.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:15.370
It's a singlet state.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.810
It has some aspects
of entanglement,

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:21.355
but it is not the entanglement
we have defined is a resource.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:32.480
So let me just repeat-- this
may be an entangled mode,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.340
but to be in an entangled
state requires systems

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.425
where you have two parts
which you can separate.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:50.730
The second comment
is we have situations

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:58.390
where we have two
different parts,

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:01.050
but they can't be
physically separated.

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:04.170
So part of our definition of
entanglement as a resource

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:22.660
is that the state must be of
two physically distinct systems.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.010
And we want to have
parts which can

00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:46.880
be separately addressed,
manipulated, and measured.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:58.435
In other words, if you read
out one part of an EPR pair,

00:07:58.435 --> 00:08:01.410
the other part still exists.

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:04.640
So that's sort of what we want.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:09.040
Let me illustrate
that with examples.

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:20.140
For instance, in the helium
atom, you have two electrons.

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:36.559
And the ground state-- if I use
spin notation, is a singlet.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.570
So that's this.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.300
But does the ground
state of helium

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:49.740
fulfill our definition
of an entangled state?

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.690
Well, if you find a way
to switch off the Coulomb

00:08:58.690 --> 00:09:01.990
potential, and then
the electrons separate

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:06.080
from each other, they still
maintain their spin singlet

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:10.640
character, then you can
take them, measure them,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.920
take measurements,
manipulate them.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.420
But since nobody has
come up with a good idea

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.010
how to switch off the
Coulomb potential in an atom,

00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:21.550
you can never
separate the states.

00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:27.920
And it is physically
impossible to address this

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.860
so the two electrons see
them separately and such.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:46.640
So this state is not
entangled, because it's not--

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.910
the two systems
cannot be separated.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.850
What is usually a good
choice for entanglement--

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.460
and this is why we discuss
it here with photons--

00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:00.010
is you have photon states.

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:02.140
Photons always fly away.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.290
Photons are in a certain
superposition state.

00:10:04.290 --> 00:10:09.130
You can always separate them,
and take them individually.

00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.250
So let's assume we have
two photons, two modes.

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:21.020
We have two photons--
actually, the two photons can

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:22.920
be in one spatial
mode, but we are now

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:25.850
playing with the polarization--
horizontal, vertical.

00:10:30.710 --> 00:10:35.810
So if we have a state
with horizontal- vertical

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:40.400
polarization, this is a nice
entangled state of two photons.

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.510
So what did means is
that we have photon each.

00:10:44.510 --> 00:10:46.060
One is vertical.

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:47.970
And one is horizontal.

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:50.270
But you don't know which one.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:52.200
If you would just
look at one photon,

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.030
it would be 50%
horizontal, 50% vertical.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.040
It would be completely
unpolarized,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.220
which would be a random
state, which would require

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.630
and density matrix
for its description.

00:11:03.630 --> 00:11:06.950
But if one photon is
horizontal, the other one

00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:08.840
is vertical and vice versa.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.350
So it's a pure state, but
all the pureness of the state

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.760
comes from the
entanglement and not

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.790
from what one photon
does by itself.

00:11:21.710 --> 00:11:24.120
So these are two
photons in one mode,

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.170
and they are
polarization entangled.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:38.140
Or this brings us back to our
dual [? Rail ?] single photon

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.200
states.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:47.330
We have two photons, two qubits
and each is in two modes.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.620
So our 0 state-- and
just to make sure

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:32.710
that you do not confuse it with
no photon, our logic 0 state,

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:39.550
so L means logic here--
is that the photon

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:45.900
is in the second mode, and
the 1 state of our logic state

00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.760
means that the single
photon is in the other mode.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:11.490
So we can now have
an entangled state,

00:13:11.490 --> 00:13:17.445
which is now this 0 1 1 0 state.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:31.850
But these are now
logic states, which

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.930
means that the 0 has one photon.

00:13:34.930 --> 00:13:37.180
It has a photon in
one of the modes,

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:39.560
and the one has a photon
in the other mode.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.440
So each state here
has two photons,

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:48.370
but then the two
photons have-- 0 1

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:52.845
and 1 0 are switched in the
two parts of the wave function.

00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:07.690
And we actually saw
in the last unit

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:13.500
how Kerr medium and
an interferometer

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:14.770
can generate this state.

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:33.695
So yes?

00:14:33.695 --> 00:14:34.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:37.299 --> 00:14:38.840
PROFESSOR: There
are two such states.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:43.310
I mean, I will later tell
you what the four famous Bell

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:44.100
states are.

00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:45.850
There is one which has
a plus sign and one

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.780
which has a minus sign.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:51.470
So when we talk about
spins in singlet state,

00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:53.610
it's often more
natural the minus sign.

00:14:53.610 --> 00:14:57.100
Here what naturally
emerged was the plus sign,

00:14:57.100 --> 00:14:59.320
but they are both
sort of Bell states

00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:04.760
and therefore, they have
what Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.230
introduced into it.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.360
So tolerate both signs.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.370
They are two different
states, but for the purpose

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:13.759
of the current discussion,
they have the same property--

00:15:13.759 --> 00:15:14.925
they're maximally entangled.

00:15:17.674 --> 00:15:18.340
Other questions?

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:31.930
OK, so let me point out that the
properties of entangled states

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:34.090
always involve two qualities.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:40.380
One is the non-local character,
because we have correlation

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:44.700
between two subsystems which may
be together when they interact,

00:15:44.700 --> 00:15:46.610
but then they can be separated.

00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:50.010
So we have correlations
which happen between the two

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:53.410
systems which are
a distance apart.

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.300
And we later come back when we
talk about Gauss inequalities

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:02.290
and that we know that physics
has non-local aspects.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:06.540
And secondly, if you
can separate two parts

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:08.530
and they interact
with the environment,

00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.350
the environment may
interact with them

00:16:11.350 --> 00:16:13.670
differently in those
two different parts.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:19.687
And therefore, entangled states
are always regarded as fragile

00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:20.520
against decoherence.

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:31.010
And it's a technical challenge
how do you find states?

00:16:31.010 --> 00:16:35.550
How do you implement entangled
states which are robust?

00:16:35.550 --> 00:16:37.110
Just to give you
one example, if you

00:16:37.110 --> 00:16:40.280
have an entangled state which
is based on electron spin,

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.320
you may be more than
1,000 times more sensitive

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.550
to magnetic field fluctuations
in your laboratory

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:50.460
than if you have qubits which
are entangled states which

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.870
are based on nuclear spin.

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:57.150
So that's a big research
area to find states which

00:16:57.150 --> 00:17:00.880
are less sensitive, or even
you immune against decoherence.

00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:19.089
OK, so I've mentioned to you
that entangled states are

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:22.300
states which you
cannot factorize.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.410
But now we can sort of start
playing with that definition.

00:17:26.410 --> 00:17:29.480
And we say, OK, if you have
an entangled state which

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:35.630
is up-down plus down-up, but
now the contribution of down-up

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.180
has only a tiny,
little amplitude.

00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:40.780
So it's almost a
pure state which

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:44.680
can be factorized with a little
bit of an extra configuration

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.039
which prevents us
from factorizing that.

00:17:47.039 --> 00:17:49.080
I mean, that doesn't look
like good entanglement.

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.660
It looks at the
whole entanglement

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.200
of the state depends
on very small admixture

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:56.990
to the wave function.

00:17:56.990 --> 00:18:00.010
And so what we
want to address now

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:02.650
is how can we quantify that?

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:05.110
How can we look at
this data and say, hey,

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:08.210
this is sort of not a
strongly entangled state.

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:12.230
It has only a weak
amount of entanglement.

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:15.160
So let's not forget,
entanglement is a resource.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.650
Entanglement allows you
to do teleportation.

00:18:17.650 --> 00:18:20.660
Entanglement allows you to
do more precise measurements.

00:18:20.660 --> 00:18:25.050
And what I want to convey
you, if a state is only

00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.630
weakly entangled,
it doesn't help

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:34.610
you much to achieve precision
beyond the standard limit,

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:36.510
effective teleportation,
and such things.

00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:45.180
Before I introduce several
measures for entanglement,

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.863
let me talk about
entanglement purification.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:56.940
It's a very nice
subject which tells you

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.570
that if you have
weakly entangled state,

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:01.790
you can make them
more entangled.

00:19:01.790 --> 00:19:03.520
And actually, the
effort you have

00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.870
to spend to make a weakly
entangled state more entangled

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:09.850
can actually act as a
measurement how entangled

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:11.650
was your state in
the first place.

00:19:11.650 --> 00:19:14.320
So the purification
is introducing us

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:16.260
with one measurement
for entanglement,

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:21.700
as I just said, but it
also gives you an idea how

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:23.250
quantum state can
be manipulated.

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:30.720
Purification is also
the first example

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:36.590
we encounter in this
course for new insight

00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:38.830
into quantum physics.

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:41.970
A lot of people thought
quantum physics, at least

00:19:41.970 --> 00:19:44.040
non-relativistic
quantum physics that

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:48.050
was invented in the '20s
in the last century,

00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:50.490
and by now we've
understood it all.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:54.410
But there was an aspect
of quantum physics,

00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:56.200
which I think nobody understood.

00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.080
And this is when you have
a quantum state, which

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:04.920
may decohere, a quantum state
which may no longer be pure,

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:10.140
that you have ways
to error correction.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:13.980
You have ways to get the
pure quantum state back.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.730
And ultimately, I
mean, in the early days

00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:18.170
when I learned
quantum physics, I

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:20.640
thought if you have a
quantum state, that's nice.

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:23.070
But if the quantum-ness
has decayed away,

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.030
you can't get it back.

00:20:25.030 --> 00:20:30.270
But this is something we
learn now from the new methods

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.910
and new approach in
quantum information science

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:35.100
that you can do quantum
error correction.

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.330
You can have a stage
which has decohered

00:20:37.330 --> 00:20:39.320
and you can get back to it.

00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.170
And there is something
which-- it's not yet

00:20:43.170 --> 00:20:46.450
that which we're discussing
today-- but in purification,

00:20:46.450 --> 00:20:49.250
you have states which have
inferior entanglement,

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.790
but you don't need to
get stuck with that.

00:20:52.790 --> 00:20:56.630
You can take several of
the purely entangled states

00:20:56.630 --> 00:21:00.354
and create the maximally
entangled state out of it.

00:21:00.354 --> 00:21:01.770
So that's what I
want to show you.

00:21:01.770 --> 00:21:04.180
So you should look
at it as one example

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:07.360
that wow, it's
really cool how we

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:12.150
can have quantum states
with inferior quality.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:15.350
And by doing quantum
operation on those states,

00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:18.450
we get something which
is more entangled,

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.405
and therefore, if that's our
purpose, has a higher quality.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:39.100
So to introduce
purification, I'm

00:21:39.100 --> 00:21:48.920
simply mentioning what are--
for two qubits-- the standard,

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:50.620
maximally entangled states.

00:21:55.670 --> 00:21:58.240
In 10 minutes or so,
we talk about how do we

00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:00.470
measure entanglement,
and indeed, those states

00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:03.600
will come out as being
maximally entangled.

00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.480
But you already get the idea.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:09.860
Maximally entangled
means they're not

00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.490
factorizable and not
just by a small margin.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.930
They may be two equal
parts of-- you always

00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:20.420
need two equal parts
of 0 1 and 1 0,

00:22:20.420 --> 00:22:22.670
and this state has
maximally entangled.

00:22:22.670 --> 00:22:26.220
It's maximally non-factorizable.

00:22:26.220 --> 00:22:30.710
So the four states which
are actually the Bell

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:37.440
states-- the famous Bell
basis-- are 0 1 plus minus 1 0

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:43.440
and 0 0 plus minus 1 1.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.140
Just to remind you if if you
have two systems, each of them

00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:49.610
has two states.

00:22:49.610 --> 00:22:52.650
You can think of spin-- spin
up, down for particle one,

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:54.610
spin up down for particle two.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.040
That Hilbert space
is four-dimensional.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.090
So you need a
four-dimensional basis.

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:03.430
And the trivial basis is up up,
down down, up down, down up.

00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:10.780
But what is relevant
for entangled states,

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:16.580
we often use the
basis of Bell states.

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:19.980
And this is a new
basis which spans

00:23:19.980 --> 00:23:21.910
the four-dimensional
Hilbert space,

00:23:21.910 --> 00:23:26.610
but each of those bases
function is maximally entangled.

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:31.500
OK we should correctly
normalize them.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:36.610
And that state is often
called psi plus minus.

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:39.625
And this here is phi plus minus.

00:23:44.010 --> 00:23:51.030
OK, so now let's get a
purely entangled state.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:57.040
And let this state 0 0 plus 1 1.

00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:00.110
But we will have
an example where

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:01.990
b may be very, very small.

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:11.020
So those states, this state
is entangled for all choices

00:24:11.020 --> 00:24:13.410
of a and b.

00:24:13.410 --> 00:24:18.550
So the question is now how can
we take such an arbitrary state

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:22.820
where a and b-- one of them
may be small, and create

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:24.070
a standard Bell state?

00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:46.270
So what we have
to assume for that

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:49.960
is that we have a large
supply of such states.

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:59.945
And so let's assume we have
large supply, identical copies.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:07.650
And now we want to
take two such copies.

00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:19.890
And what I want to outline
you is the following--

00:25:19.890 --> 00:25:22.510
you take sort of
two of your copies,

00:25:22.510 --> 00:25:24.940
and you do a measurement.

00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:31.400
And I will tell you what kind
of qubit operation we need,

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.730
what kind of
measurement we perform.

00:25:33.730 --> 00:25:38.120
And then when the outcome of the
measurement is such and such,

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:42.900
you say-- OK let me be specific.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:45.910
So if you take two
copies, we have a total

00:25:45.910 --> 00:25:50.080
of two states with
two photons each.

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.330
And now we perform
a quantum operation

00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.790
on two of the photons, and
the other two photons we leave

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.470
untouched.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:02.580
So now it depends when the
measurement of the two photons

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.320
has a good outcome, we
know those other two

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:07.930
photons are maximally entangled.

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:09.360
They're in a Bell state.

00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:12.310
If the outcome of the
measurement is bad,

00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.150
it tells us the two
photons are not entangled,

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.210
and we throw them away.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:19.850
So therefore, we have
a finite probability

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:27.070
by performing measurements
that a pair of our sample

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:29.560
state with the
coefficient a and b

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.920
will result into a maximally
entangled state-- in a Bell

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.700
state.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.446
And I want to describe now
what is the protocol, what

00:26:36.446 --> 00:26:39.720
is the procedure
to implement that.

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:42.620
And what we will
find-- and this is

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:47.120
what I think you should expect
here-- if the initial state has

00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.600
very bad entanglement in the
sense that b is very small,

00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.760
we will need many, many
attempts doing many measurements

00:26:55.760 --> 00:27:00.450
on our pair of states before
we produce a Bell state.

00:27:00.450 --> 00:27:03.420
It's probabilistic,
but the probability

00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.390
to succeed in preparing a
Bell state will depend on-- we

00:27:08.390 --> 00:27:11.447
will see-- the
product of a and b.

00:27:11.447 --> 00:27:12.030
Any questions?

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:12.700
Yes.

00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:17.420
AUDIENCE: Does the assumption
of large supply of the state

00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:19.592
violate no-cloning in any sense?

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.860
PROFESSOR: The
question is, does it

00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.840
violate the no-cloning theorem?

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.470
No, it doesn't,
otherwise I would not

00:27:29.470 --> 00:27:31.886
say we have a large supply,
because the no-cloning theorem

00:27:31.886 --> 00:27:32.690
is absolute.

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:36.000
But it simply means we
cannot have one state,

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.280
and then clone and clone
more and more copies.

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:41.700
Let me be specific.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:43.850
If you have an
experiment which produces

00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:46.190
a certain superposition
state, you

00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:49.510
can just push the button on
your experiment many times,

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:52.340
and produce, in the
identical create,

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:53.990
as many states as you want.

00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:55.890
If you have spin-up
state-- well,

00:27:55.890 --> 00:28:01.310
this is now for two photons,
but if you have a spin-up state,

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.760
you can make as
many copies as you

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:09.690
want of the state which has
been rotated by a certain angle.

00:28:09.690 --> 00:28:12.510
So therefore, in
state preparation,

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.670
by going through
the exact procedure,

00:28:14.670 --> 00:28:18.810
we can just create as many
copies of a state we want.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:21.410
The no-cloning [INAUDIBLE]
meant the following--

00:28:21.410 --> 00:28:24.960
I give you one state
which may be a spin which

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:26.990
has been rotated
at a certain angle.

00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.290
You know nothing
about the state.

00:28:29.290 --> 00:28:32.540
And now you should try
to make a copy out of it.

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:37.340
And the answer is you can't,
because any measurement you do

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:40.390
is-- if the particle
were spin up

00:28:40.390 --> 00:28:42.570
and you would measure
spin up or speed down,

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:44.070
you could say I got spin up.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:47.560
Now I produce 10
spin up particles.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.570
But you don't know
along which axis

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:51.400
the spin has been prepared.

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:57.280
So unless you know which axis
the spin has been oriented,

00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:05.457
and if you choose another axis,
you have irreversibly lost

00:29:05.457 --> 00:29:07.040
information which
cannot be retrieved.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:12.890
I don't know if it
helps you, but if you

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.400
have a certain state, and
you're going to measure it

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:19.890
without destroying it, you
need a quantum non-demolition

00:29:19.890 --> 00:29:20.980
measurement.

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.430
If you're in energy eigenstate,
you can measure energy.

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.170
If you're in a spin eigenstate
which points along Z,

00:29:26.170 --> 00:29:31.110
you can measure the direction
of the spin in the Z direction

00:29:31.110 --> 00:29:32.690
without destroying it.

00:29:32.690 --> 00:29:35.690
So if you can do a quantum
non-demolition measurement

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:38.070
on a state, you could clone it.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:43.040
But that violates the assumption
that if I give you an arbitrary

00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.890
state, you do not know
by definition what kind

00:29:46.890 --> 00:29:48.950
of measurement is a
non-demolition measurement.

00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:51.690
You just take your
chance, you try

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:55.440
to take a Stern-Gerlach
experiment, separate the spins

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.980
in the Z component,
and then it turns out

00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.680
I gave you a state which
is polarized along x.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:07.224
So that's a subtle, but
important difference.

00:30:07.224 --> 00:30:07.890
Other questions?

00:30:10.490 --> 00:30:21.680
So we take two copies and
let's bring in Alice and Bob.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:28.050
So the first photon we
associate with Alice.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:32.640
And the second photon
is associated with Bob.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:44.120
So if you take two
copies-- we have now

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.290
is an Hilbert space, a
four-dimensional Hilbert

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:50.180
space, a direct product.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:55.180
And if you just take
the state and calculate

00:30:55.180 --> 00:31:10.940
the direct product, you get four
terms-- 0 0 1 1, 0 0 1 1, 1 1

00:31:10.940 --> 00:31:15.820
0 0, and 1 1 1 1.

00:31:15.820 --> 00:31:22.980
And the coefficients
are given here.

00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.510
Let me just underline
that it if you

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:33.170
think we have some state
with some entanglement,

00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.180
and we separate the
system, one goes to Alice

00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:39.910
and one goes to Bob.

00:31:39.910 --> 00:31:45.969
So the one which Alice has
is the first part of it

00:31:45.969 --> 00:31:46.510
those states.

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:56.380
And Bob has the other part.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:09.060
So the protocol is now that
Alice and Bob first, they're

00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:11.040
not doing a measurement.

00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:13.080
They're not reading
out the system.

00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:15.780
They perform a
unitary operation.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.690
And what Alice and
Bob have formed

00:32:17.690 --> 00:32:22.940
is the controlled NOT
operation on the two qubits.

00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:27.950
Let me just write it
down and then explain it.

00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:37.105
Perform what is called the
controlled NOT or CNOT gate.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.480
And I've explained before
in the last section how

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.070
the controlled NOT
can be performed

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:57.100
using a non-linear
Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.000
So Bob and Alice both
run their two photons

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
with the non-linear
Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.280
So what is a controlled NOT?

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.470
Let me remind you.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:17.260
If you have two qubits, the
first one is the control.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:20.840
If the control is 1,
you flip the second one.

00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:25.020
If the control is 0, you do
nothing to the second one.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:33.993
So the controlled
CNOT transforms.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:46.650
So since the first qubit
is the control qubit, out

00:33:46.650 --> 00:33:50.410
of those four combinations,
the controlled NOT only

00:33:50.410 --> 00:33:58.190
does something if Alice's
controls and Bob's controls

00:33:58.190 --> 00:34:02.800
is 1, and then the
second bit is flipped.

00:34:02.800 --> 00:34:06.310
If Alice's and Bob's
controls are 0,

00:34:06.310 --> 00:34:08.870
they do nothing
to the second bit.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:14.699
So therefore, the 1 1 0
is transformed into 1 1 1,

00:34:14.699 --> 00:34:20.329
and the 1 1 1 1 is
transformed into 1 1 0 0.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:35.820
So that's the first operation.

00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:37.130
Let me just indicate it.

00:34:42.650 --> 00:34:47.270
So what has happened here, the
0 0 has been flipped into 1 1

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.650
and the 1 1 has been
flipped into 0 0.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:51.949
That's the first step.

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:55.150
The second step is
that now Alice and Bob

00:34:55.150 --> 00:34:56.925
measure their target qubit.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:10.920
What does that mean?

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:13.050
We have a controlled
NOT operation.

00:35:13.050 --> 00:35:15.470
In the controlled
NOT operation, we

00:35:15.470 --> 00:35:18.470
have the first one
is the control qubit.

00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:22.200
The second one is the
target of the operation.

00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:27.190
So in our, the way
how we write it,

00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:31.710
Alice's target is
the third in line,

00:35:31.710 --> 00:35:34.430
and Bob is the fourth in line.

00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:39.980
So now Alice and Bob
measure the target qubits.

00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:41.130
Let me just be specific.

00:35:41.130 --> 00:35:43.920
So Alice has number
one and number three.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.200
Bob has number two and
four, and the target qubits

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:48.460
are the third and fourth.

00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:08.470
So what is the probability that
Alice and Bob measure both 1 1,

00:36:08.470 --> 00:36:13.810
that they both find
the target qubit of 1?

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:18.050
Well, it is this one
and it is this one

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.980
where the controlled
NOT has flipped it.

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.940
So one has the probability
a squared b squared.

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:26.650
The other one has probability
a squared b squared.

00:36:26.650 --> 00:36:38.270
So with probability 2 a
squared b squared-- well,

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.425
let's allow a and
b to be complex.

00:36:45.590 --> 00:36:51.900
They obtain 1 and 1.

00:36:51.900 --> 00:37:02.600
So in this case, what
is left is here 0 0.

00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.810
What is here left is 1 1.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:07.590
You may just need
an intermediate line

00:37:07.590 --> 00:37:11.890
to write down what the state
is after the measurement.

00:37:11.890 --> 00:37:15.850
But if you read it
off here, you find

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:20.610
that when they
obtain 1 1 1, that

00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:43.170
implies the post measurement
state is then 0 0 plus 1 1

00:37:43.170 --> 00:37:48.275
divided by square of 2, and
this is one of our Bell states.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:02.070
So what we had is we had
a system of four photons

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:04.850
after a qubit operation,
the controlled NOT.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:08.930
Alice and Bob do a measurement
together on two of the photons.

00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:09.860
Collins.

00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:13.500
And if the outcome of
this measurement is 1 1,

00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.780
the rest of the system
is in the Bell state.

00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:30.000
So we assume that
Alice and Bob have

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:33.970
a large supply of those copies.

00:38:33.970 --> 00:38:41.820
So let's assume that they
start with n copies of psi.

00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:47.490
And then, because the
probability is m over n,

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:54.320
they successfully obtain m
copies of the Bell state.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:39:01.090
And the question is,
what is the probability

00:39:01.090 --> 00:39:03.320
in the limit of
a large ensemble.

00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.680
And we will see in a few
moments that this is actually

00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:13.770
a measurement of how entangled
the original space is.

00:39:20.255 --> 00:39:21.630
Any questions
about purification?

00:39:29.250 --> 00:39:32.900
Well, then let's
measure entanglement.

00:40:04.650 --> 00:40:09.420
The basic idea
here is that if you

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:14.430
have a state up/down plus
down/up, it's a pure state.

00:40:14.430 --> 00:40:18.850
But this pure state
has a correlation

00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.410
between the two subsystems.

00:40:21.410 --> 00:40:25.080
And the idea is
now entanglement is

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.890
that there is a correlation
between the two subsystems.

00:40:27.890 --> 00:40:30.290
And you can say well,
it would be a good way

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:34.070
to characterize entanglement if
I only look at one subsystem.

00:40:34.070 --> 00:40:36.400
In this case, you
look at one subsystem,

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:40.320
and you would just randomly
see spin up, spin down.

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:44.660
Spin up spin down is described
by the unity density matrix,

00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:48.490
which is, therefore, the
most random state on earth.

00:40:48.490 --> 00:40:58.200
So if you have a pure state and
you only look at one subsystem,

00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.570
the more random
the subsystem is,

00:41:00.570 --> 00:41:04.970
the more the pureness
of the initial state

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:08.340
comes from correlations,
comes what is entanglement.

00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:10.520
So therefore, what I
want to introduce now

00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:14.230
as a measure of entanglement is
that we take the total system

00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:16.660
and then we perform
the partial trace.

00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:18.930
We only look at one subsystem.

00:41:18.930 --> 00:41:23.620
And the purer the subsystem
is, the less entangled

00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:26.200
it is, because in
the ultimate limit

00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:29.790
that our system factorizes into
two pure states, when we look

00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:32.430
at the subsystem, we
still have a pure state.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:36.550
So the purity of the subsystem
in terms of pure state

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.010
is now a measure
of entanglement.

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:43.260
The purer the subsystem is,
the less entangled it was.

00:41:51.070 --> 00:42:05.820
So the basic idea here
is entanglement is

00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:09.420
related to correlations.

00:42:17.010 --> 00:42:25.760
And if you take half
of a Bell state--

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:28.920
so if two particles which
are an EPR pair and we

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:36.330
take half of it-- then half
of it is completely random.

00:42:36.330 --> 00:42:42.150
So let me illustrate that.

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:47.520
So if you take one
half of-- let's just

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.400
take one of the Bell
states, phi plus,

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:56.410
which was the superposition
of 0 0 plus 1 1.

00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:06.870
So let me be specific, because
we need it for the definition.

00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:14.310
We describe this ensemble of
this system in a pure EPR state

00:43:14.310 --> 00:43:16.660
by a density matrix.

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.960
The density matrix
is nothing else

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.060
than you take your total system.

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:30.255
So this is now the
density matrix.

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:42.750
So in our case, psi a
b is just the state.

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:51.720
And now we describe
the subsystem

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.210
by performing a
partial trace on rho.

00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:00.900
The partial trace is
over the system b.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:06.460
And that means we take all
eigenfunctions k b of state b,

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.480
sum over all k's, and
this is our partial trace.

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:16.440
So therefore, we would take
our statistical operator

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:25.970
from the line above, and
perform the partial trace

00:44:25.970 --> 00:44:33.640
where those states are
the state 0 and 1 of b.

00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:39.970
So these are the states of b.

00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:46.220
So when you do that,
you just insert that.

00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:50.110
You find that what
you get is 1/2.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:54.700
a has been traced out,
so b has been traced out.

00:44:54.700 --> 00:45:02.180
And what we obtain for a is
just from the two terms above.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.710
This gives that,
and this gives that.

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:14.800
And you immediately realize that
this is 1/2 times the identity

00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:16.520
matrix.

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:22.450
So therefore, we
have shown that this

00:45:22.450 --> 00:45:24.000
is a completely random state.

00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:40.270
So now we can characterize
the randomness

00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:46.570
of the partial trace of the
density operator obtained

00:45:46.570 --> 00:45:49.560
by performing the partial trace
with the standard von Neumann

00:45:49.560 --> 00:45:50.060
entropy.

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.420
As a reminder, the
von Neumann entropy

00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:08.470
for statistical operator rho
is defined as the expectation

00:46:08.470 --> 00:46:15.490
value of rho log rho, where we
take the logarithm with respect

00:46:15.490 --> 00:46:17.560
to the base 2.

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:22.200
So this is the trace
of rho log rho.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:31.300
Or if we use the
eigenvalues of rho,

00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:35.700
we multiply eigenvalues with the
logarithm of the eigenvalues.

00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:59.870
So for a pure state,
the entropy is 0,

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:04.000
because a pure state has
one eigenvalue, which is 1,

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.480
and the log of 1 is 0, so
we get 0 for pure state.

00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:21.510
For completely
mixed state, we're

00:47:21.510 --> 00:47:24.350
talking about a state which
has two dimensions, so it

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:25.580
can be up and down.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:31.780
A completely unique state has
probabilities of 1/2 each.

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:36.150
And then we say the entropy
of this state is one,

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:38.225
or we call it one bit.

00:47:38.225 --> 00:47:40.205
Yes.

00:47:40.205 --> 00:47:42.680
AUDIENCE: About the
volume [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:45.401
expectation of rho
log rho is called

00:47:45.401 --> 00:47:50.600
a trace [INAUDIBLE] expectation
of log rho, expectation

00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.560
of [INAUDIBLE] trace of the
operator times density matrix.

00:48:09.922 --> 00:48:11.630
PROFESSOR: OK, so this
is just a reminder

00:48:11.630 --> 00:48:14.110
of how we measure entropy
of density matrix.

00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:15.720
And now we apply
it to entanglement.

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:27.730
We define now the entanglement
for the entanglement

00:48:27.730 --> 00:48:41.620
e over state psi a b to be
the entropy of the density

00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:50.160
matrix for system a after
tracing out system b.

00:48:50.160 --> 00:49:04.690
And for pure state, this is-- it
doesn't matter whether we trace

00:49:04.690 --> 00:49:08.930
out a or b if you start
with a pure state.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:13.530
The entanglement, the entropy
of the statistical operator

00:49:13.530 --> 00:49:17.490
rho a and rho b are the same.

00:49:17.490 --> 00:49:19.210
I tried for a
moment to prove it.

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:20.410
I saw it quoted somewhere.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:22.820
I didn't succeed
in a split second,

00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:24.871
so either I
overlooked something,

00:49:24.871 --> 00:49:26.870
or it's a little bit more
involved to show that.

00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:33.100
So therefore, to
use the inverts,

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:40.680
our definition says that the
entropy, so the entanglement,

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:46.415
is nothing else than the entropy
of the reduced density matrix.

00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:04.700
And we immediately see if
we have any of the four Bell

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:09.640
states, by performing the
partial trace over one qubit,

00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:11.820
we obtain the identity matrix.

00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.000
So therefore, the entropy
of all the Bell states is 1.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.123
Let me state without
proof-- when we come back

00:50:30.123 --> 00:50:38.350
to the purification
scheme the result

00:50:38.350 --> 00:50:45.440
is that the probability or
the optimum probability--

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.620
if you do stupid
measurements on your states,

00:50:47.620 --> 00:50:49.110
of course you get nothing.

00:50:49.110 --> 00:50:54.540
But the optimum strategy to
create pure Bell states out

00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:59.520
of your reservoir of
poorly entangled states--

00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:06.180
so for an optimum strategy, the
success probability m over n

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.285
actually turns out to be
not a different measure

00:51:09.285 --> 00:51:10.580
of entanglement.

00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:13.490
It is the entanglement
which we have just

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:16.210
defined through the entropy
of the partial trace.

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:23.630
So therefore-- and I
think this is nicely

00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:25.930
illustrated with the
purification scheme--

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.170
entanglement is a real resource.

00:51:28.170 --> 00:51:32.170
When you have better
entanglement to start with,

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:37.590
then you can get more copies.

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:40.590
You can get more
pure Bell states

00:51:40.590 --> 00:51:44.660
out of your supply of
poorly entangled states.

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:48.800
So therefore, you lose
more if your states are not

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:49.490
fully entangled.

00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:52.035
You lose more of them,
and therefore, the success

00:51:52.035 --> 00:51:54.980
of the purification
scheme makes it clear

00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:56.690
how entanglement is a resource.

00:51:56.690 --> 00:51:58.850
If you have entanglement,
it's precious.

00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.340
You had to do
something to get it.

00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:13.020
I didn't point out
entanglement is not

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:18.580
something which one number
characterize it, it's all.

00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:21.250
We introduced to you
already another measurement

00:52:21.250 --> 00:52:43.300
of entanglement through
the Schmidt number,

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:46.320
which was in
homework number two.

00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.490
And usually when you
have different measures

00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:52.310
for entanglement, they're
not one to one related.

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:56.120
It seems that, similarly when
we measured non-classic light,

00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.320
we had a G2 function.

00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.090
We had [INAUDIBLE]
bunching, antibunching.

00:52:59.090 --> 00:53:01.740
We have negative
quasi probabilities.

00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:05.370
And it's often clear
that one system which

00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:08.910
is truly non-classical,
fulfills all the criteria,

00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:12.320
but how the quantitative
measurements are related

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.010
to each other is really subtle.

00:53:15.010 --> 00:53:18.350
In the case of entanglement,
for a long time it

00:53:18.350 --> 00:53:20.490
has even been a big
question in research--

00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:22.490
if you have an
arbitrary density matrix

00:53:22.490 --> 00:53:24.830
with a complicated
many-body system,

00:53:24.830 --> 00:53:28.310
how can you even characterize
the entanglement?

00:53:28.310 --> 00:53:30.470
We are focusing
here on pure states

00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:32.390
where things are fairly simple.

00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:36.400
But in the general situation
of a many-body system,

00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:40.502
it can be quite challenging
just define and measure

00:53:40.502 --> 00:53:41.043
entanglement.

00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:44.880
Any questions?

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:45.902
Yes.

00:53:45.902 --> 00:53:47.985
AUDIENCE: If you have a
general [INAUDIBLE] that's

00:53:47.985 --> 00:53:50.895
not necessarily a
pure state, can you

00:53:50.895 --> 00:53:52.835
show that it's
always the reduced

00:53:52.835 --> 00:53:55.260
trace of the bigger [INAUDIBLE]?

00:54:05.020 --> 00:54:08.872
PROFESSOR: Say again, if I
have a general state which is--

00:54:08.872 --> 00:54:13.291
AUDIENCE: You have a subsystem--
let's say you have two spins,

00:54:13.291 --> 00:54:14.764
and then you have
a density matrix

00:54:14.764 --> 00:54:19.680
for the first-- or actually just
to say that you have one spin

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.804
and you have a density
matrix for that single spin,

00:54:21.804 --> 00:54:26.232
it's a matrix, not
necessarily a pure state.

00:54:26.232 --> 00:54:27.708
Let's say it's a mixed state.

00:54:27.708 --> 00:54:31.152
Then you can introduce
a fake second spin

00:54:31.152 --> 00:54:36.072
and show that this matrix is the
trace of a matrix [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:36.072 --> 00:54:39.516
and maybe just put that one in
a pure state and do some stuff,

00:54:39.516 --> 00:54:42.665
do some calculations
more easily.

00:54:42.665 --> 00:54:43.290
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:54:48.266 --> 00:54:50.450
If you have a
density matrix, you

00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:53.570
can always regard it as a
partial trace of a bigger

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:54.820
system.

00:54:54.820 --> 00:55:01.050
That means you always represent
your state as a pure state,

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:03.570
but it is entangled
with a bigger system.

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:09.500
However, what the big system
is, is by no means unique.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:15.170
I'm missing the
technical word-- it's

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:17.410
called unraveling
the density matrix.

00:55:17.410 --> 00:55:21.170
You can always represent the
density matrix written down

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:23.300
in forms of pure state.

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:26.055
But this unraveling of
the density matrix-- no,

00:55:26.055 --> 00:55:27.550
actually, its related.

00:55:33.830 --> 00:55:36.090
When I said yes, I thought
about the unraveling

00:55:36.090 --> 00:55:37.430
of the density matrix.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:39.760
You can always write
down a density matrix

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:42.950
as a mixture of pure states,
but which are the pure states

00:55:42.950 --> 00:55:44.130
is not unique.

00:55:44.130 --> 00:55:46.270
So when you say my
density matrix is

00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:48.460
half of the atoms are spin
up and half of the atoms

00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.040
are spin down, somebody else
would say, no, that's not true.

00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.630
Half of the atoms are spin
[INAUDIBLE] and spin x

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:57.665
and some are in spin minus
x, and those representations

00:55:57.665 --> 00:55:59.330
are equivalent.

00:55:59.330 --> 00:56:02.300
So I was just thinking of that
as to write down the density

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:04.720
matrix in the pure state basis.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.006
But you are asking about--

00:56:07.006 --> 00:56:11.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] what
he's asking about [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:13.490
PROFESSOR: Somehow, but
I was thinking of that,

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:15.448
but I think the answer
to your question is yes.

00:56:15.448 --> 00:56:17.094
So you said, you confirmed that.

00:56:17.094 --> 00:56:18.510
AUDIENCE: Yes, but
I am forgetting

00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:19.966
the name of the theorem here.

00:56:19.966 --> 00:56:20.800
AUDIENCE: Isn't it just
purification again?

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah, it's
related to purification.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.175
You can prove that you're
using purification.

00:56:26.175 --> 00:56:27.050
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.716
AUDIENCE: Using
purification [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:28.716 --> 00:56:32.717
but I'm completely forgetting
the names of [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:32.717 --> 00:56:33.550
PROFESSOR: But wait.

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:36.060
We've talked here
about-- just to be clear,

00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:39.030
we've talked here about
purification of a pure state.

00:56:39.030 --> 00:56:44.070
We started with a
pure state and we

00:56:44.070 --> 00:56:48.555
purified it to be a Bell state
by doing certain measurements.

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:54.170
So we've not talked here
about density matrices,

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:58.250
but it sounds very plausible
that you can always

00:56:58.250 --> 00:56:59.630
construct a bigger system.

00:56:59.630 --> 00:57:06.030
But I should look it up and
see if there is an exact proof.

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:09.839
It's-- intuitively
it sounds correct.

00:57:09.839 --> 00:57:10.505
Other questions?

00:57:16.210 --> 00:57:22.310
OK, so we have discussed the
definition of entangled state.

00:57:22.310 --> 00:57:25.650
We've talked about purification
of entangled states

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:28.700
and how to measure it.

00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:38.060
I want to talk now
about how we can

00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:39.960
create entangled
states for atoms.

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:54.390
Maybe let me say the following--
so by now we are convinced.

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:57.090
Entangled states are great,
and we want to create them.

00:57:57.090 --> 00:58:02.670
And for photons, I showed you
that some simple element--

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:08.660
beam splitters, Kerr medium--
can create entanglement.

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:12.390
It's much harder to
do that with atoms.

00:58:12.390 --> 00:58:15.140
Now, we want to
do it with atoms,

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:17.950
because atoms-- in
contrast to light-- they're

00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:20.730
pretty much staying still,
whereas photons always

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.610
move at the speed of light.

00:58:22.610 --> 00:58:25.690
And the only way to
make photons stand still

00:58:25.690 --> 00:58:27.650
is you put them in a
cavity and then they

00:58:27.650 --> 00:58:28.860
bounce back and forth.

00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:31.940
But even in super cavities
with the highest reflectivity

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.160
mirror, you get-- what are
the longest ring-down times

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.970
you get-- fraction of
a second, milliseconds,

00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:39.570
depending kind of
in which domain

00:58:39.570 --> 00:58:42.010
you work-- microwave
domain, optical domain.

00:58:42.010 --> 00:58:45.960
Whereas atoms, you can hold onto
your qubits for a long time.

00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:50.460
So therefore, if you
want to use entanglement

00:58:50.460 --> 00:58:52.520
as a resource for
certain protocols,

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.420
you want to have entangled atoms
where the entanglement would

00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.290
like for a long time.

00:58:58.290 --> 00:59:00.700
So the question
is now for atoms,

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.610
we do not have perfect beam
splitters and perfect Kerr

00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:05.340
mediums.

00:59:05.340 --> 00:59:08.273
Also, we can control
interactions between atoms

00:59:08.273 --> 00:59:10.180
for [INAUDIBLE] using
VSEPR resonances,

00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:11.720
but that's another story.

00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.510
But now let me ask a question,
how do we entangle atoms?

00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:35.090
And I want to first
show you that if you

00:59:35.090 --> 00:59:40.100
had the right system,
things can be fairly simple.

00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:46.370
This is a suggestion which
was made almost 20 years ago,

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:49.580
and it goes like
follows-- if you

00:59:49.580 --> 00:59:54.420
have a diatomic molecule
of two identical atoms,

00:59:54.420 --> 00:59:58.520
in this case
mercury, and mercury

00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:03.270
doesn't have-- this molecule
doesn't have any electron spin,

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:06.730
but mercury has a nuclear spin.

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:11.680
And if you now photo-dissociate
mercury and two mercury atoms

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:17.070
fly away, then you have
separated a spin singlet

01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:18.860
into two parts.

01:00:18.860 --> 01:00:21.480
And now you have
created the Bell state

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:22.840
up/down minus down/up.

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:33.680
So you could say this is sort
of the example-- this realizes

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:37.420
very closely the example I
gave you with the helium atom,

01:00:37.420 --> 01:00:40.210
where I said you have an
electron in spin up and spin

01:00:40.210 --> 01:00:44.220
down, but there was no way
to separate the electrons.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:47.730
Therefore, you can say it is a
state which has entanglement,

01:00:47.730 --> 01:00:50.970
but it's not entanglement
as a resource.

01:00:50.970 --> 01:00:54.620
But right now, here
it becomes a resource

01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:58.610
once you have found a
method to separate the two

01:00:58.610 --> 01:01:02.700
parts of the wave function that
you can give one to Alice, give

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:07.570
one to Bob, and they can
perform the operations on it.

01:01:07.570 --> 01:01:09.470
Well, if it looks so
simple, why don't we

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:12.810
have entangled atoms everywhere?

01:01:12.810 --> 01:01:15.650
This experiment has been
suggested 20 years ago,

01:01:15.650 --> 01:01:18.900
but nobody has done it,
or some several groups

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:21.280
have worked on it.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:26.750
You need a molecule
with suitable states.

01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:30.660
You don't want any electron
spin which interferes with that.

01:01:30.660 --> 01:01:33.970
All you want to have
is two nuclear spins.

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:35.650
You want a singlet state here.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.830
So those requirements
are not easily fulfilled

01:01:38.830 --> 01:01:41.760
with real atoms.

01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:45.400
Of course we liked-- and also
who wants to work with mercury?

01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:49.170
Mercury has transitions
in the ultraviolet.

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:51.215
I think there's only one
group in the world who

01:01:51.215 --> 01:01:53.710
has operated a magneto
optic trap with mercury.

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.440
So it's not your tabletop atom.

01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.550
So therefore, let's
now talk about a method

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:06.120
how we can entangle
atoms by using light.

01:02:06.120 --> 01:02:08.540
So if you take
atoms, maybe we can

01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:10.630
use the light which
has been emitted

01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:13.770
from the atoms, performing
measurement on the light,

01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:17.730
and then depending on the
outcome of the measurement,

01:02:17.730 --> 01:02:20.795
we know the atoms are entangled.

01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:35.770
So Professor [? Swann ?] calls
this the poor man's entangler.

01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:39.830
I don't know why poor man's.

01:02:39.830 --> 01:02:43.160
You still need quite a
bit of equipment to do it.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.250
But at least it seems
the poor man's solution

01:02:46.250 --> 01:02:49.680
if you can't make the
above experiment work.

01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.280
So this addresses
a question that,

01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:05.330
just for technical
reasons matter

01:03:05.330 --> 01:03:07.900
is more difficult to entangle.

01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:12.830
Whereas photons are easy.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:34.360
Yeah so you can say
the idea is related

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.290
to the purification scheme.

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:45.680
We can't take a system of two
atoms, atom one and atom two

01:03:45.680 --> 01:03:51.810
which are unentangled, and we
shine some laser light on them,

01:03:51.810 --> 01:03:52.890
excite them.

01:03:52.890 --> 01:03:54.780
Then they emit photons.

01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:57.520
So all we can do
is-- we can only

01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.260
talk to the atoms
with the photons.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:00.790
So the only thing
we can do now is

01:04:00.790 --> 01:04:02.830
we can measure the two photons.

01:04:02.830 --> 01:04:06.380
And then the situation will be
similar as in the purification

01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:09.170
scheme, where Alice and
Bob did a measurement.

01:04:09.170 --> 01:04:15.140
If Alice and Bob said both
of our target qubits are one,

01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:21.940
then what was left behind was
in a pure, entangled Bell state.

01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:25.560
And similarly, what you want to
do here is we have two atoms.

01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.940
There was nothing special about
them but they scatter light.

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:32.480
And if you now perform a
measurement on the photons

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:36.030
and the outcome of the
measurement is positive,

01:04:36.030 --> 01:04:39.800
then we know for sure what has
been left behind is entangled.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:42.420
That's the idea.

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:46.560
So it shares with the
purification scheme

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.610
that it is a probabilistic
entanglement.

01:04:48.610 --> 01:04:51.090
You run your
experiment many times.

01:04:51.090 --> 01:04:52.062
You do a measurement.

01:04:52.062 --> 01:04:53.520
If the measurement
is positive, you

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.340
say now I have an
entangled state.

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:58.220
And maybe then you can move on
to measure the entanglement.

01:04:58.220 --> 01:05:01.815
You can move on to do
teleportation, other things you

01:05:01.815 --> 01:05:03.190
want to do with
entangled states.

01:05:03.190 --> 01:05:07.035
But if your measurements
says no, bad luck.

01:05:07.035 --> 01:05:09.770
The probability hasn't
worked out this time.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:12.150
You just press a button
again, scatter light

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:14.209
again of your two atoms
and/or your two ions

01:05:14.209 --> 01:05:16.000
and hope that the next
outcome is positive.

01:05:20.990 --> 01:05:26.780
So the idea is we
want to introduce now

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:31.550
a probabilistic method.

01:05:39.390 --> 01:05:44.355
It's based on two
atoms emitting light.

01:05:48.070 --> 01:05:52.170
And the result is with
a certain probability

01:05:52.170 --> 01:05:53.690
that we get entangled atoms.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:36.036
Let me just scroll down and
show you one thing I want to--

01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:49.170
When I prepare the notes and
everything is clear to me,

01:06:49.170 --> 01:06:51.260
but then I want to explain
it to you and say hey,

01:06:51.260 --> 01:06:52.480
I have to motivate you.

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.110
If I just go
through a few lines,

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:55.550
you wonder what it leads to.

01:06:55.550 --> 01:06:57.600
So let me maybe first
give you the explanation

01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.350
I would have given you
a little bit later.

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:07.160
What is an entangled
state is if the atoms are

01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.870
in maybe one of two ground
states-- one atom is in one

01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:13.990
ground state, the other
one is in the other one,

01:07:13.990 --> 01:07:15.490
or it is flipped.

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:18.430
So we know one atom is
in the ground state one.

01:07:18.430 --> 01:07:20.640
One atom is in the
ground state two,

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:22.350
but we don't know
which one is in which.

01:07:22.350 --> 01:07:25.320
It is in the
superposition state.

01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:28.100
So what you need
now in this scheme

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:32.270
is the following-- if
the atoms scatter light,

01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:35.840
they can go to two
different ground states.

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:43.600
And we know to
which ground state

01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:47.320
they have gone, because
due to selection rules,

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.050
they reach one ground state
with polarization one.

01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:53.310
They reach one ground state
with polarization two.

01:07:53.310 --> 01:07:56.840
So therefore, when we had
two atoms, they emit light

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.480
and we would measure the
polarization of the light,

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:01.340
we would know in
which state they are.

01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.570
But if you know atom
1 is in state 1,

01:08:03.570 --> 01:08:06.940
and atom 2 is in state
2, this is not entangled.

01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:10.010
So what we have to do is when
the two atoms have emitted

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:14.590
photons, we have to mix the
photon at the beam splitter.

01:08:14.590 --> 01:08:16.500
And after the beam
splitter, when

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.420
we measure that the
photon is polarized,

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:23.710
we know that one of the atoms
is in one of the ground states,

01:08:23.710 --> 01:08:25.470
but we don't know which.

01:08:25.470 --> 01:08:31.069
So therefore, we can now
use-- the photon carries

01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:35.510
through the polarization the
information in which ground

01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:37.270
state the atom is.

01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:40.790
But now we have to perform
operations to the photons

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:44.680
that for fundamental
reasons, fundamental quantum

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:48.310
measurement, we know there
is one photon in one state,

01:08:48.310 --> 01:08:50.910
but we have no way
to ever figure out

01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:54.220
which atom has
emitted the photon.

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:56.170
So that's the idea,
and the protocol

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:59.130
I want to show you now is what
do we have to do to the two

01:08:59.130 --> 01:09:02.390
photons to make sure
that we never know,

01:09:02.390 --> 01:09:06.130
that we can't find out which
atom has emitted the photon.

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:08.210
And we have to do little
bit more tricks also

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:10.930
to make sure that when we do
a measurement on the photon,

01:09:10.930 --> 01:09:14.870
we know the atoms are
in the Bell state.

01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:15.830
Questions about that?

01:09:37.899 --> 01:09:41.254
So therefore, we
need a beam splitter.

01:09:45.689 --> 01:09:48.870
So we can come back to
what we have already

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:50.274
introduced in the last section.

01:09:58.540 --> 01:10:02.990
So each atom will emit a photon.

01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:07.020
And I will actually show
you at the end of the class

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.350
that people have
entangled with that scheme

01:10:09.350 --> 01:10:12.000
two ions which were in
two different ion traps.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.290
So you have two distance atoms.

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:16.960
They emit light, and after
the measurement process,

01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.190
you know they are entangled.

01:10:18.190 --> 01:10:19.990
And that's pretty cool.

01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:24.190
So the situation how we do it is
we have two photons which come.

01:10:24.190 --> 01:10:26.130
But the first thing
we have to make sure

01:10:26.130 --> 01:10:28.250
is we have to
scramble the photons.

01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:30.190
We have to make sure
that we can't find out

01:10:30.190 --> 01:10:32.470
from which atom the
photon has come,

01:10:32.470 --> 01:10:35.320
and this is done with
the beam splitter.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.330
So there is one aspect
of beam splitters

01:10:38.330 --> 01:10:41.710
and two photons which have
to explain to you now.

01:10:41.710 --> 01:10:49.620
And this is this famous
HUM, Hong-Ou-Mandel.

01:10:52.540 --> 01:11:00.430
This is the Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference.

01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:02.480
It's a very famous
effect, and it's actually

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.140
very, very special.

01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:07.280
So let me explain
what happens when

01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:13.160
we have two photons
in the same state--

01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:18.327
two identical photons, same
frequency, same polarization--

01:11:18.327 --> 01:11:19.410
coming to a beam splitter.

01:11:28.820 --> 01:11:32.010
So we have already
all the tools.

01:11:32.010 --> 01:11:35.050
So we have a beam
splitter characterized

01:11:35.050 --> 01:11:37.560
by this angle theta, which
through cosine theta,

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.930
sine theta determines what
the beam splitter is doing.

01:11:40.930 --> 01:11:46.730
And all we want to do is we
apply it now to the state 1 1.

01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:54.190
So what we will find is
that there is a probability

01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:58.050
to get one photon each.

01:11:58.050 --> 01:12:03.140
Then there is a probability to
get two photons in one output.

01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:06.010
And it will actually
be the same probability

01:12:06.010 --> 01:12:10.370
with a minus sign in the
amplitude to get 0 2.

01:12:10.370 --> 01:12:14.120
And the matrix which acts
on each of the photons

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.040
has cosines and sines.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:25.690
So what we get is products
of trigonometric functions.

01:12:25.690 --> 01:12:31.370
And here for getting
two photons in one arm,

01:12:31.370 --> 01:12:41.390
it's square root 2,
cosine theta, sine theta.

01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:48.680
And the spectacular
thing here is

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.090
what happens when we have
a balanced beam splitter.

01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:11.510
If you have the
50-50 beam splitter--

01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:15.040
and this is called the
Hong-Ou-Mandel interference,

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:23.630
you have the situation where
you have a beam splitter,

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:28.840
you have one photon,
you have two photons.

01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:34.560
And it is absolutely
impossible that afterwards, you

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:36.590
have one photon in each arm.

01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:40.210
So you send two photons
on a beam splitter,

01:13:40.210 --> 01:13:42.890
and after the beam
splitter is, you

01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:46.190
have either two photons
coming out here,

01:13:46.190 --> 01:13:48.470
or two photons coming out there.

01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:56.630
You can say it's Poissonic
stimulation photons and bosons.

01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:58.010
That all plays a role.

01:13:58.010 --> 01:14:02.500
If one photon goes one path,
the other photons follow suit.

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:10.970
This is now very powerful,
because it already

01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:14.620
happens, of course, when the
two photons are identical.

01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.840
We had to use in this
formalism the photon is

01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:20.030
in the same mode on each part.

01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:22.560
But that means now
the following--

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.340
if you set up photo
detectors here,

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:28.260
and each photon
detector makes click,

01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:30.850
you know you had
one photon each.

01:14:30.850 --> 01:14:36.310
And that tells you that the two
photons were not identical--

01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:40.380
for instance, because they
have different polarizations.

01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.980
So if you want to
now, with the atoms,

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:44.840
get a Bell state, where
atoms decay-- one atom

01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:47.110
decays to state
one, one atom decays

01:14:47.110 --> 01:14:51.160
to state two-- the
signature of that

01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.050
would be that we
have one atom each.

01:14:55.050 --> 01:15:04.660
And if you do it right, one atom
each is an ingredient for 1 2

01:15:04.660 --> 01:15:06.780
plus 2 1 for Bell state.

01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:10.010
We can detect that we have one
photon each because at such

01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:13.260
a beam splitter, it's
only in this situation

01:15:13.260 --> 01:15:16.500
that we can get one photon
after each beam splitter

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:21.020
if we start with two
non-identical photons.

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:24.990
Of course, by the way,
experimentally there are quite

01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:28.130
some challenges, even if
you have identical photons

01:15:28.130 --> 01:15:31.870
of the same polarization, if
they arrive as a nanosecond

01:15:31.870 --> 01:15:35.710
pulse, and they don't arrive
exactly at the same time

01:15:35.710 --> 01:15:39.390
at the beam splitter, then
you first split one photon,

01:15:39.390 --> 01:15:41.800
and then the next photon,
and the two photons cannot

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:43.330
influence each other.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:46.030
So there are a lot of
experimental requirements

01:15:46.030 --> 01:15:48.065
to realize this
ideal experiment.

01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:02.590
So as I was preparing
for today's class,

01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:12.317
I actually saw a paper which
just came out in "Science."

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:35.750
So in this month's
"Science" they

01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:39.215
discussed the Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference experiment

01:16:39.215 --> 01:16:41.440
with fermions.

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:44.150
So let me just
explain what happens.

01:17:11.930 --> 01:17:12.783
OK, now it fits.

01:17:21.330 --> 01:17:24.720
So if you have two
identical photons,

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:29.530
if you have two particles which
impinge on the beam splitter--

01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:33.380
they are the two input beams
for the beam splitter--

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:36.620
you would say you have
four different outcomes.

01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:40.630
One is both come out
here, both come out here.

01:17:40.630 --> 01:17:43.730
Or they are both
reflected, or they are both

01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:45.500
transmitted through.

01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.080
And what happens is bosons--
as I just pointed out--

01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:52.690
bosons characterized by
photons can only do that.

01:17:52.690 --> 01:17:55.430
Identical photons
want two bunch up.

01:17:55.430 --> 01:18:02.390
They appear in pairs-- 50%
left output, 50% right output.

01:18:02.390 --> 01:18:05.260
Well, for fermions, they
just do the opposite.

01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.680
For fermions, you will
always get one particle each.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:10.637
You may immediately,
of course, explain it

01:18:10.637 --> 01:18:12.720
with the Pauli Exclusion
Principle, which does not

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.650
allow two particles to
be in the same state

01:18:14.650 --> 01:18:16.240
after the beam splitter.

01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:19.850
And you should contrast it
with classical particles.

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:22.620
When you have two
classical particles,

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:26.950
you will actually find that all
of those four possibilities,

01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:28.865
each of them has
a 25% probability.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:37.830
So it was a major
experiment which

01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:40.070
was featured in "Science"
when people realized

01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:42.720
that with electrons,
they created electrons

01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:48.950
in a semiconductor
structure, and showed

01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:53.210
through some
statistical measurement

01:18:53.210 --> 01:18:56.920
that this was the
physics which happened.

01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.090
The measurement they did
is, I forgot details--

01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:02.820
if you have bosons and you get
either two here or two there,

01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:05.720
you have more fluctuations in
your system than for fermions.

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:07.810
And they conclusively
showed that they

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:11.040
had realized the Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference for fermions.

01:19:37.390 --> 01:19:39.190
I think we have to stop.

01:19:39.190 --> 01:19:46.780
Let me just add one more
thing and then we are done.

01:19:50.070 --> 01:19:54.760
So this Hong-Ou-Mandel
interference

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:59.640
is at the heart of how
perform the measurement which

01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.200
is ultimately
entangling the atoms.

01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:05.180
But we need one more element.

01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:09.130
We need sort of to scramble
the photons in one more way,

01:20:09.130 --> 01:20:17.860
and this is by adding circular
polarizers at the input.

01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:21.650
So we assume for now
that we start out

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:26.860
with linear polarization
in those states.

01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:30.140
And here is our beam splitter.

01:20:30.140 --> 01:20:35.710
Here is mode a and mode
be, which we detect.

01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:42.990
And before we measure
this Hong interference,

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:47.930
we put in quarter-wave
plates which

01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:49.900
provide circular polarization.

01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:13.120
If you start with linearly
polarized light-- we

01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:19.610
put in a polarizer-- after
the circular polarizer,

01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:21.640
we have this linear
superposition

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:27.330
of horizontal and
vertical at mode one,

01:21:27.330 --> 01:21:30.130
and we have linear
polarization-- superposition

01:21:30.130 --> 01:21:34.340
of linear polarization
in mode two.

01:21:34.340 --> 01:21:42.100
So this is a situation at the
input of the beam splitter.

01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:47.440
And if we expand it,
we have probabilities

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:51.860
where the polarization
is different,

01:21:51.860 --> 01:21:56.040
and where the
polarization is the same.

01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:59.280
So we have two detectors here.

01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:10.310
And if both detectors
click, then we

01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:16.050
know that the input
to the interferometer

01:22:16.050 --> 01:22:20.840
was not H H nor V V,
because in that case,

01:22:20.840 --> 01:22:23.820
the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference
would have directed

01:22:23.820 --> 01:22:27.300
both photons to one
output, and we would not

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:29.950
have obtained clicks from both.

01:22:29.950 --> 01:22:34.840
So therefore, when
both detectors click,

01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:39.840
we know that the quantum state
before the interferometer--

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:48.620
before the beam splitter-- was
H V or V H-- or, of course,

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:53.200
in another basis, one of those.

01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:55.230
And this is sort of
the ingredient, which

01:22:55.230 --> 01:22:56.810
I will show you on
Wednesday, which

01:22:56.810 --> 01:23:00.230
can lead to probabilistic
entanglement of atoms.

01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:01.010
Any questions?

01:23:04.250 --> 01:23:07.760
OK, one announcement-- we
post this week's homework

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.340
assignment later today.

01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:11.290
It will be due in a week.

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:13.300
See you on Wednesday.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.498 --> 00:00:02.790
PROFESSOR: It's sort of a
little bit thrown in between.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.530
What you've done is
you've essentially

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.680
just finished doing the whole
section on energy models.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.680
Remember we started all
the way in the beginning

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.930
with empirical potential models
when doing [INAUDIBLE] method,

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.820
and then Professor Marzari
did quantum mechanics.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.710
A lot of the rest of
what you're going to see

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.730
is on particular
simulation techniques

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.330
that bring in dynamics and
temperature into the problem.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.880
What I wanted to do
with this lecture

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.320
is sort of tell you
the story of my life.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.990
You work so hard on
doing quantum mechanics,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.460
and you do it well.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.310
And you come up with all
these beautiful things

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.820
you calculate in energies, and
you give a whole talk on that.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.550
And there'll always
be some smarty pants

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.800
in the audience that will get
up at the end of your talk

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.050
and say, you know.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.230
But all your calculations
are at 0 temperature.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.520
And so basically with
one slight comment,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.160
they basically wipe your
whole talk off the table.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.020
And half of the room
suddenly sort of thinks

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:08.860
that you're just kind
of a funny curiosity.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.580
So what I want to do
here today is teach you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.080
sort of to what extent
does temperature matter.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.950
So first of all, when are
zero-temperature calculations

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.870
relevant?

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.440
When are they extremely good
to mimic the real world, which

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.880
is non-zero temperature?

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.380
When is it so so?

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.280
And when do you absolutely need
to take temperature explicitly

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.610
into account?

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.790
And then the next step
is, how do you do that?

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.490
Now I will give you
hints of that today

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.220
already-- how you do that.

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.350
But later the rest of the
course is essentially on that.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.442
So to learn to push
the right buttons here.

00:01:51.442 --> 00:01:52.860
Huh?

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.100
So again these are the
objectives of today.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.830
And maybe what I'll add a
little is sort of, why is it

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:03.050
so hard to include temperature?

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.250
People who don't do
simulations often

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.097
think that, why don't you
just turn on that button?

00:02:10.097 --> 00:02:11.430
There's this button temperature.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.080
And why don't you turn it on?

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.230
Why don't you just do
zero-temperature calculation?

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.050
So but if you look at
the Kohn-Sham equations,

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.310
obviously, there is
no temperature in it.

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.650
OK?

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.740
So this is not like some
physical approximation

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.320
that we can decide
to turn on or off.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.810
It turns out if you want to
deal with temperature effects,

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.310
there's a whole lot
of work you have

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.240
to do on top of your
energy calculation.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:46.200
You can see why that is.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.450
Essentially what you're
doing with quantum

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.200
mechanics is you're calculating
the ground state energy.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:00.540
Now essentially
temperature is no more--

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.070
when you're at
non-zero temperature,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.310
it's exactly making the same
statement in saying, you know,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.000
I've put energy in my system
to make it be above the ground

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.600
state energy.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.440
So at non-zero temperature,
you've pumped in extra energy.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.330
There's many ways
you can see that.

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.390
You can just see that from
the derivative of the energy

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.600
with temperature, which is the
heat capacity, which is always

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.090
positive, which means
as soon as you raise

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.780
the temperature from 0,
the energy has gone up

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.340
above your ground state energy.

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:35.370
So where is that energy?

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.310
This is going to be the key
question when you want to deal

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:39.810
with temperature simulation.

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.440
First of all, let me tell you
there is no generic temperature

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.240
simulation.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.580
There is no one way to
include temperature,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.110
and this is going to be
an important message.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.700
And the reason is
that extra energy goes

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.220
into excitations of the system.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.880
OK?

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.790
It goes into, you know,
displacements of atoms,

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:00.660
phonon modes.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.730
It can go into
electronic excitations.

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:04.890
It can go into defects.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.100
And you will have
to explicitly choose

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.120
which of these excitations
you include in your modeling.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.878
So every time you do a
temperature modeling, most

00:04:15.878 --> 00:04:17.670
of the time, what that
means is that you're

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.300
going to have selected a series
of excitations in which you

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.520
allow energy to be pumped
in for temperature,

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.790
but that means you will
have excluded other ones.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.190
There is essentially
no technique

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:32.970
that allows for all
possible excitations

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:33.960
as you have in nature.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.970
So we will often go
back between sort

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.900
of the measure of
temperature as temperature,

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.560
or simply the measure
of excitation energy

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.380
as temperature.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:51.065
Essentially, the
amount of energy

00:04:51.065 --> 00:04:54.980
you're above the ground
state can be used

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.830
as a measure of temperature.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.150
And let me show that.

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.870
Here's a little bit of
statistical mechanics

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.815
in a sort of classical picture.

00:05:10.815 --> 00:05:12.440
Some of you may have
seen this already.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.510
Some of you may have not.

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.060
If you haven't seen this,
just try to maybe just get

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.020
the general idea.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.880
You know, in
classical mechanics,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.300
you often write the Hamiltonian,
which is essentially

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.430
what's used to derive
your equation of motion

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.368
in generalized coordinates qi
and generalized momenta pi.

00:05:29.368 --> 00:05:31.160
And the reason you have
both is, of course,

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.530
because you have potential
and kinetic energy.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.000
The momentum will represent
the kinetic energy,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.880
and the generalized
coordinates will

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.535
represent the potential energy.

00:05:42.535 --> 00:05:44.410
So the reason they're
generalized coordinates

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.030
is because they don't
just-- they're not just

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:47.050
coordinates of atoms.

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:48.790
They could be
linear combinations

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:53.210
of those coordinates
of atoms, for example.

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.180
So the Hamiltonian
is then essentially

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.780
the potential energy as
a function of the two

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.150
and the kinetic energy
as a function of the two.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.750
In general, the kinetic energy
can be a function of both,

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.270
and the potential energy
can be a function of both

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.030
although normally you find
that internal energy is only

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.850
a function of the
generalized coordinates.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.740
And the kinetic energy
is only a function

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.015
of the generalized momentum.

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:22.360
The equipartition theorem
essentially tells you

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.280
the definition of temperature.

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.040
It tells you that the
expectation value of, say,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.550
the momentum times the
Hamiltonian derivative

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:33.400
with that momentum, that
the expectation value is

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.890
kT and the same
for the expectation

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.130
value with the
generalized coordinate.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.540
And sort of you can kind of see
a little bit what that means.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.090
The derivative of a
Hamiltonian, which you can think

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:47.890
of as an energy function--

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.650
the derivative of a
Hamiltonian with respect

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.070
to a coordinate, that's
a force typically.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.090
So this is a force
times a coordinate,

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:01.060
and here you have a force
times the displacement.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.440
So these are energy terms.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.440
These are work and power terms.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:11.710
The expectation value is the
time average expectation value.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.890
This is the general statement
not for quadratic Hamiltonians.

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:23.540
You'll see we get a more
useful and more common result.

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:25.630
So a quadratic
Hamilton is one where

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.558
the Hamilton, the energy
terms, are second powers

00:07:28.558 --> 00:07:29.350
of the coordinates.

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:31.330
And this is what
you very often get.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:35.380
If you have a velocity, then
your kinetic energy is mv

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:38.410
squared over 2-- so the
quadratic in the momentum

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.840
the momentum being mv.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.280
If you had coordinates that
move in a harmonic potential,

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.000
a quadratic potential if
two things were connected

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.360
by a spring, an ideal
harmonic spring,

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:56.680
then the potential energy would
be quadratic in the spring

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:57.410
distance.

00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.433
OK?

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:00.100
So in that case, you
can work through it

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.400
because then the derivative of
the Hamiltonian with respect

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:07.870
to any of these things is
linear in the coordinates.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.390
So since you multiply,
you get something that's

00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:12.430
quadratic in the coordinates.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.390
So then what you get is that
essentially up to some constant

00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.285
the average of the
squared coordinate,

00:08:19.285 --> 00:08:23.715
or squared momentum,
is kT over 2.

00:08:23.715 --> 00:08:25.090
So what that's
really telling you

00:08:25.090 --> 00:08:29.080
is that every degree
of freedom you think

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:33.280
of-- every qi, every pi
is a degree of freedom.

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:39.940
Every degree of freedom contains
a thermal energy equivalent

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:43.600
to kT over 2.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:45.497
And this is sort of an
interesting statement

00:08:45.497 --> 00:08:47.830
because it doesn't tell you
anything about the stiffness

00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:49.570
of that degree of freedom.

00:08:49.570 --> 00:08:55.880
In principle, if I have
even a stiff spring

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.440
or a loose spring--

00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.290
losing my words this morning--

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.320
have the same thermal energy
at a given temperature.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.660
Even though they will
vibrate very differently,

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:11.930
the stiff spring
will not vibrate

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:14.730
a lot, which will vibrate
with small amplitude

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:16.670
but at high frequency.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:17.450
OK?

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.390
And the soft spring will
vibrate at low frequency

00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:22.460
with lower amplitude.

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.060
But so they all have the
same degrees of freedom.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.250
And so this is how you
can calculate, like,

00:09:41.250 --> 00:09:43.200
typical heat capacity.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.970
So if you think of n atoms,
how many degrees of freedom

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:50.580
do you have if with
n atoms you have

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.870
three coordinates for atom?

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:54.030
So you have three
degrees of freedom

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:55.500
for the coordinate-wise.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.300
You have three
velocity components.

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:00.410
So you have 3n components
from the velocity,

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:03.760
so you have 6n
degrees of freedom.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.280
So what's the thermal energy
when you have 3n atom?

00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.150
It's 6 nkT over 2 of them.

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:14.070
So it's 3nkT.

00:10:14.070 --> 00:10:15.780
And that's the sort
of classical result

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:19.770
you find that the
thermal energy is 3 nkT--

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:21.540
so what's the heat capacity?

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:23.280
It's 3 times k.

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.020
And those of you
who've taken thermal

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:26.760
from me, that's the
law of Dulong-Petit

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.560
if you remember that.

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.090
It comes straight out of
the equipartition theorem.

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.550
There's some subtleties.

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:43.050
This statement is only
true when the energy

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:46.260
depends quadratically
on these coordinates.

00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:49.000
So people often
remember the statement.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.530
But now where it comes from?

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:55.192
So if your particle is moving
in a non-harmonic, which you'll

00:10:55.192 --> 00:10:57.150
typically see if you
start getting oscillations

00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:00.180
far from equilibrium--
around equilibrium,

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.900
you tend to be
quadratic in a potential

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.000
if you go far away to see
non-quadratic behavior.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.730
This will not be true anymore--

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:12.990
and the same thing
for the velocities.

00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:16.800
But there's maybe a
more important subtlety.

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.240
This is only true--

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.360
what we did now is
classical mechanics,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.490
and the results we get are only
true for degrees of freedom

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.690
for which there's enough
energy for them to be excited.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.380
And what do I mean with that?

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.570
We know from quantum
statistical mechanics

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:37.200
that the states are
degrees of freedom,

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:42.030
and the energy associated
with them is quantized.

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:47.250
So you cannot move from the
ground state continuously

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.690
in excitations.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.760
The first excitation
from the ground state

00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.810
takes a finite amount of energy.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:58.250
If you live on a temperature
scale for which you don't have

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.610
enough energy to get
that first excitation,

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:03.230
then the system
will essentially not

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:06.200
be excited in those
degrees of freedom.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.440
And they will not contribute
to the thermal energy.

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.550
OK?

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:13.370
So if you live at,
say, room temperature,

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:18.020
that's 25 millielectron volts,
and your first excitation

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:22.250
is 1 electron volt,
that degree of freedom

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:27.620
is not going to contribute to
the internal energy or the heat

00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:28.430
capacity.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:29.630
OK?

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:34.400
So that's a bit of a
subtlety that shows up

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.720
with the equipartition theorem.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:43.380
And this is if
you remember why--

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:46.320
so the classic the
classical heat capacity

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:51.810
is 3 kb from what
I've shown you before.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:55.140
But if you remember this is
why if you plotted versus

00:12:55.140 --> 00:13:03.410
temperature, the heat capacity,
it is 3 kb at high temperature.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.510
But then it sort of drops
off to low temperature

00:13:05.510 --> 00:13:08.630
because essentially the
heat capacity coming

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:12.140
from the atomic
displacements gets

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.750
frozen out because the atomic
displacements are quantized.

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:18.320
They're not continuous in
a quantum mechanic sense.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.820
So in some sense this is
the subtext of the lecture.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.910
And if you're going to
do a non-zero temperature

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:45.680
simulation, I assume you
do that to get a certain--

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:50.390
see a certain behavior or
calculate a certain property.

00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:54.920
You need to understand
right away which excitations

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.980
you're going to sample.

00:13:57.980 --> 00:14:01.760
Which excitations that are going
to be present in your model

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.710
to allow for the extra energy
that comes with temperature?

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.690
So that means that you
have to understand first

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:11.390
the excitations that are
relevant for the behavior

00:14:11.390 --> 00:14:14.950
you want to study, and
you have to understand

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:17.080
how they store energy.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.720
And I'll give you
some examples of that.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.610
I'll try to make that a
lot clearer in a second.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:26.090
So, you know, how do
materials store energy?

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:30.280
Here's some possible
excitation mechanisms.

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.990
Electronic.

00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:36.010
You know, you're calculating
quantum mechanics not only

00:14:36.010 --> 00:14:38.320
the atomic ground state--

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.342
you know, you relax
all the atoms.

00:14:40.342 --> 00:14:41.800
I think you've done
that in the lab

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.540
now to the lowest
energy position.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:47.440
But you always, always find
the electronic ground states,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.000
but at non-zero
temperature you can

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.590
have electronic excitations.

00:14:50.590 --> 00:14:55.210
You know, think of electron
excitations across a bandgap

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:58.150
as, if the bandgap's large, it's
a small number of electrons.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.540
But if you have a metal, you
know, then the Fermi level

00:15:01.540 --> 00:15:03.580
is in the density of states.

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:04.830
There's no gap there.

00:15:04.830 --> 00:15:06.520
So you can have,
at any temperature,

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.190
excitations of electrons
across that gap.

00:15:09.190 --> 00:15:11.440
And I'll show you later
some actual results

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:15.730
to see how important or
not important that can be.

00:15:15.730 --> 00:15:17.447
Vibrational are
the obvious ones.

00:15:17.447 --> 00:15:19.030
So that's the one
you always think of.

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.520
If you raise the temperature,
what do atoms do?

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.540
They move kind of.

00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:24.160
They start vibrating.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.770
That's kind of the
typical obvious one.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:31.330
I know everybody's staring at
this picture of springs going.

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:34.610
It's amazing how we
can hypnotize you.

00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:37.840
And then there's of course
more subtle excitations.

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.430
If you have a compound, an
ordered system where atoms are,

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:44.980
say, ordered in a
pattern, they might

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.380
start inter-changing positions.

00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:52.540
So we think of these as
configurational excitations.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.100
The equivalent in
polymers is that you

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.670
change the confirmation
of polymers

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:02.390
at elevated temperature.

00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.860
So what kind of
changes might you

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:16.025
want to look at where you
think you need temperature?

00:16:16.025 --> 00:16:17.650
There's obviously
things-- obvious one.

00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:20.050
Crystal structure changes.

00:16:20.050 --> 00:16:21.550
Sometimes you want
to calculate what

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.340
the structures of
material, and it's already

00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:27.970
a really hard problem
to do that at 0 Kelvin

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.090
because it's a sort of
non-local optimization problem.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:36.693
If I give you gold,
silver, and fluorine,

00:16:36.693 --> 00:16:38.860
and I tell you I'd throw
these together in a bucket,

00:16:38.860 --> 00:16:40.762
what will they form?

00:16:40.762 --> 00:16:42.470
I don't even know they
will form a solid,

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:44.770
but let's say they did.

00:16:44.770 --> 00:16:46.630
That's a global
optimization problem.

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:50.680
You cannot solve that by local
optimization minimizing forces

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.130
on coordinates.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:52.630
OK?

00:16:52.630 --> 00:16:55.270
So the zero-temperature
problem is already hard enough.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.980
But then I tell you, well, the
crystals structures we know

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:00.830
can change as a
function of temperature.

00:17:00.830 --> 00:17:03.710
So now not only do you have
to find the ground state,

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.710
but you have to
figure out what are

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.190
the sort of entropic factors,
the excitations, that

00:17:09.190 --> 00:17:13.420
make free energy different from
energy and therefore structures

00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.270
change as a function
of temperature.

00:17:16.270 --> 00:17:18.609
Chemistry can be very important.

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:21.550
Changes in chemistry as a
function of temperature-- this

00:17:21.550 --> 00:17:23.380
is sort of an often
overlooked one.

00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:27.190
When you work with
materials, many of them

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:30.130
are open systems
to the environment.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.500
A perfect example
is an oxide if you

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.530
take an oxide
that's by definition

00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.480
open to the environment
because it can exchange oxygen

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.560
in the environment.

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:41.830
So most people who
work with ceramics

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:44.710
know that, if you heat them high
enough, they start reducing.

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:46.780
So they start losing
oxygen. So this

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:49.360
is one of these things where
it's an obvious temperature

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.350
effect.

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:51.330
Properties.

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.000
You know, there's
obvious properties--

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
electrical conductivity,
thermal conductivity.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.470
All these things are very
temperature dependent.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:18:00.640
They actually, in some
cases, have trivial forms

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:01.780
at low temperature.

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.000
And then there's sort of
trivial properties-- volume.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.520
Maybe you want to know what
the thermal expansion does?

00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.780
So I'll go through
several of these.

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:11.230
And the reason I do
it is because there's

00:18:11.230 --> 00:18:14.050
no unique method
to do all of these.

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:16.780
So depending on what
it is you're after,

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:19.840
you're going to have to
come up with different signs

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:22.000
and a different toolset.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.780
So I thought I'd give you a
very straightforward example.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:29.320
Here's a work done I
think by Andrew Huang--

00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:34.330
I don't remember-- at Livermore
showing the temperature

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:38.020
dependence of the bulk
modulus of copper.

00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:42.320
And what you see here is
three different results.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.890
So that's the LDA result.

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:47.860
And you know what that is-- the
local density approximation.

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:51.280
The GGA result, notice that
it's as you kind of expected

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:53.380
and we discussed
a little-- softer.

00:18:53.380 --> 00:18:55.540
And then the experiment
is the green points.

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.270
The experiment is
right in between.

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:06.670
So let's say somebody asked you
to calculate the temperature

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:11.680
dependence of the bulk
modulus of the material.

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.050
How do you turn
temperature on here?

00:19:14.050 --> 00:19:16.360
In essence, what
I'm asking you is

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.780
what is the essential physics
that makes the bulk modulus

00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.190
temperature dependent?

00:19:21.190 --> 00:19:23.320
Because if you know that,
then that's the physics

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.040
you want to include.

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:25.995
OK?

00:19:25.995 --> 00:19:27.370
So you could say,
well, you know,

00:19:27.370 --> 00:19:29.020
I'm going to do
this brute force.

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.510
I'll do a big molecular
dynamics simulation.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:35.230
And after this we'll start
molecular dynamics in a class.

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.270
And that's definitely a way that
you would get the temperature

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.610
dependence of the bulk modulus.

00:19:39.610 --> 00:19:42.280
But in some cases, you
can do this much faster

00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.340
if you're sort of smart about
what the physics is that going.

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.990
Let me sort of show you
what the question really is.

00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:54.820
The bulk modulus is defined
as the second derivative

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:57.520
of the energy with
respect to volume,

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:58.990
but there's some
subtleties there.

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:07.840
Correctly, it's the second
derivative of the free energy

00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:10.540
with respect to volume.

00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:14.530
Now you have to evaluate
that derivative somewhere.

00:20:14.530 --> 00:20:18.880
You evaluate it at the
equilibrium lattice constant.

00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:20.500
OK?

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.410
So what do you do when
you do the bulk modulus

00:20:23.410 --> 00:20:25.270
at 0 temperature?

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.687
What we do is you don't
have the free energy.

00:20:28.687 --> 00:20:30.520
Well, the energy is
equal to the free energy

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.353
at zero-temperature.

00:20:31.353 --> 00:20:34.780
So first of all, you take
the second derivative

00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.690
of the energy not
of the free energy.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:42.190
And you don't take it at the
finite-temperature lattice

00:20:42.190 --> 00:20:43.060
parameter.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:45.310
You take it at the
zero-temperature lattice

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:46.750
parameter.

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.500
OK?

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.660
So we have two sources of error.

00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:54.100
And one is they both require
a different solution.

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.070
We use energy to
calculate the bulk modulus

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.690
at zero-temperature
rather than free energy.

00:20:59.690 --> 00:21:03.850
And we use the zero-temperature
lattice parameter rather than

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:06.310
the finite-temperature
lattice parameter.

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:11.620
So the question is, which of
the two is the dominant one?

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.488
Or do they sort of--
if you're out of luck,

00:21:13.488 --> 00:21:16.030
they both kind of contribute
the same effect, which means you

00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:17.840
need to deal with both of them.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.880
Well, that's what sort
of this picture tells us.

00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.680
What these two lines are is the
bulk modulus artificially taken

00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.180
at different lattice constants.

00:21:28.180 --> 00:21:30.138
And the way you can do
that is you can actually

00:21:30.138 --> 00:21:35.650
plot either energy or free
energy as a function of lattice

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:39.520
parameter, and then
in the minimum,

00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:40.540
you have a bulk modulus.

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:42.373
It's the curvature
there, but you could also

00:21:42.373 --> 00:21:45.045
get it, the curvature, at
other lattice parameters.

00:21:45.045 --> 00:21:46.420
And so you'd get
the bulk modulus

00:21:46.420 --> 00:21:48.710
as a function of the
lattice parameter.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:49.870
And it's done in two ways.

00:21:49.870 --> 00:21:53.200
It's done by taking
derivatives of the energy.

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.300
That's the purple curve here.

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.520
And then the brown
one is done by taking

00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.770
derivatives of the free energy.

00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:02.860
So what do you see?

00:22:02.860 --> 00:22:08.200
Well, what you see is that
neglecting the entropy

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.030
in the second derivative
is not a big deal because,

00:22:13.030 --> 00:22:15.490
at a given lattice
parameter, whether I

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:19.390
take the derivative of the
energy or the three energy

00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.370
is not a big error.

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:23.890
Where does the biggest
error come from?

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:27.890
It's that if I'm not at the
right lattice parameter.

00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:33.250
So what causes the temperature
dependence of the bulk

00:22:33.250 --> 00:22:35.800
modulus is the fact that
the lattice parameter

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.850
changes with temperature.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:39.320
OK?

00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.770
And see now we've made a
really big step forward,

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:47.120
because if we're willing to
work on the data approximation,

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:49.880
then all we need to do is
get the lattice parameter

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.710
as a function of temperature
and just calculate

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.960
the curvature of the energy
in that lattice parameter.

00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.540
Now we have a good
approximation--

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:58.070
the bulk modulus.

00:22:58.070 --> 00:23:01.700
Now this is a slightly
recursive problem

00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:04.160
because, I'm going to
show in a second that,

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:06.450
if you want the
lattice parameter,

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:08.600
if you want to
predict it, you'll

00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.270
actually need the entropy.

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:13.190
So you need the
free energy anyway.

00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:17.020
But sometimes you have
the lattice parameter.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:17.570
OK?

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:19.040
Sometimes you just,
you know, want

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.540
the bulk modulus, say, at the
experimental lattice parameter

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:22.982
you've measured it.

00:23:22.982 --> 00:23:25.190
Now what I'm saying is, if
you have that information,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:27.410
there is no need to do
a temperature-dependent

00:23:27.410 --> 00:23:28.130
simulation.

00:23:28.130 --> 00:23:30.763
You just take the curvature
in that lattice parameter,

00:23:30.763 --> 00:23:31.430
and you're done.

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:37.870
So the physics here that
drives the temperature

00:23:37.870 --> 00:23:41.485
dependence of the bulk modulus
is the thermal expansion.

00:23:56.970 --> 00:24:01.305
So here's sort of a
zoology of numbers

00:24:01.305 --> 00:24:04.980
that I've taken
out of this paper.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.950
You know, I am a strong
believer in numbers.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:09.480
That's why I feed you so many.

00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:14.020
I believe that science
without numbers is out there.

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.620
And so I'm sorry if that sort
of bores you with numbers.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.320
But I do believe from
actually looking at the facts,

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.120
you separate fact from reality.

00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.600
No-- fiction from reality.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.540
So here's sort of
three different options

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:34.200
for calculating
the bulk modulus.

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:38.850
So here the bulk
modulus is calculated

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.082
at the zero-temperature
lattice parameter.

00:24:41.082 --> 00:24:42.540
That's what you
would typically do.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:47.320
Say, for a lithium, the lattice
parameter that you calculate,

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.370
this is in LDA, is 341.

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.730
And you get a bulk modulus
that's 15.4 gigapascal,

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.850
and experimentally
it's 11.6 just

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:02.200
like you expect it's too
stiff very typically in LDA--

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.720
same deal for the other metals
although for aluminum it's

00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:06.640
not as bad.

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.450
OK.

00:25:07.450 --> 00:25:12.250
Then you could say, well, I
remember what Sader taught me

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:13.420
in the lecture.

00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.450
If I want to have the room
temperature bulk modulus,

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:19.900
all I need to do is calculate
the bulk modulus at the room

00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:21.590
temperature by this constant.

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:23.787
So that's what this is.

00:25:23.787 --> 00:25:25.870
So you take the room
temperature lattice constant.

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:29.500
You calculate the
curvature there.

00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:32.850
And notice that now you're on
the other end of experiment.

00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:33.350
OK?

00:25:36.266 --> 00:25:37.940
And then you can
do something else.

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:41.390
You can do the full
blown thing and actually

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.900
try to find the
equilibrium-room-temperature

00:25:44.900 --> 00:25:47.990
lattice parameter of your
LDA, which isn't necessarily

00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.610
the real one.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:49.110
Remember?

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:51.170
LDA will tend to
over-contract things

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:55.272
and calculate the
bulk modulus there,

00:25:55.272 --> 00:25:56.480
and that's what you get here.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.370
And, of course, this is better.

00:26:01.370 --> 00:26:04.940
And it's sort of typical
because you're, in some sense,

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.570
working in a consistent
solution of the Hamiltonian.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.530
You know, this is the minimum
the Hamiltonian gives you,

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:16.430
whereas at this
lattice parameter,

00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:20.677
you're actually above
the real minimum.

00:26:20.677 --> 00:26:22.510
And with this one,
you're actually below it.

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:33.080
So if you want to do
the full solution,

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.570
you would go and look
at the thermal expansion

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:37.520
to predict the
lattice parameter.

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.100
Well, how do you do
thermal expansion?

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.580
Well, remember where thermal
expansion comes from.

00:26:48.710 --> 00:26:51.290
Thermal expansion comes
from essentially the volume

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:55.400
dependence of the free energy.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.840
And that comes from two terms.

00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.720
You have an energy
that's volume dependent,

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.750
and you have an entropy
that's volume dependent.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.420
And the minimum
volume is obtained

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:11.487
by minimizing this with
respect to the volume.

00:27:11.487 --> 00:27:13.070
There's another way
you can show where

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:14.510
thermal expansion comes from.

00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:17.763
And here I have to brush
up my own thermal again,

00:27:17.763 --> 00:27:20.180
but essentially you can show
that it comes from the volume

00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:23.390
dependence that you can get
it from only this term--

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:25.790
from the volume dependence
of the entropy--

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:33.176
because the volume
dependence of the entropy.

00:27:33.176 --> 00:27:35.460
Here, you can use all
this beautiful stuff

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.430
of Maxwell relations and,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:40.755
You can write this as
a chain derivative.

00:27:51.150 --> 00:27:59.990
And so what you get is that
this is the compressibility

00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.970
times the dv/dt.

00:28:01.970 --> 00:28:03.890
And so dv/dt, this
is essentially

00:28:03.890 --> 00:28:07.290
the thermal expansion.

00:28:07.290 --> 00:28:12.240
And so what you see is, since
dp/dv is always positive,

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:15.540
pressure rises less
negative pressure

00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.780
to get a smaller volume
and increase the pressure.

00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.610
So the thermal expansion depends
on how the entropy changes

00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.690
with volume.

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:27.000
So the critical part--

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.250
this is the hard
part-- is calculating

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:31.470
the entropy of the system
and, not just the entropy,

00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:34.300
the entropy as a
function of volume.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.850
And to calculate the
entropy is exactly

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:39.550
the same problem as
dealing with temperature

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.050
because the entropy
is essentially

00:28:41.050 --> 00:28:44.710
counting the excitations
your system goes into.

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:48.640
And temperature is the average
energy of those excitations.

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:51.250
But so to get entropy is the
same problem as temperature.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.900
You have to know
which excitations

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.640
you have to deal with, and you
have to have a model for them,

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.310
and you have to
equilibrate them.

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:57.810
OK.

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:05.800
Where will most of
that entropy come from?

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:10.060
Typically, we think of thermal
expansion largely caused

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:13.150
by vibrational entropy--
by phonon entropy.

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:18.650
So why does the entropy
go up with volume,

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.710
which is what gives
you thermal expansion?

00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:23.680
Because if you
stretch the material,

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.190
the bonds get slightly softer.

00:29:27.190 --> 00:29:30.490
So the vibrational
frequencies gets smaller.

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:31.870
They gets weaker.

00:29:31.870 --> 00:29:36.250
The bonds get softer, so
you get more vibrations.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.160
Or in a quantized
scheme, remember

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:42.910
that the spacing
between the zeroth level

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.530
of a phonon and the
first excited one

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:50.940
is h nu, h times the frequency.

00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:53.110
So if the frequency
becomes smaller,

00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:55.010
your first excited
state is closer.

00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.220
So you excite more.

00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:57.220
You have more disorders.

00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:58.510
You have more entropy.

00:29:58.510 --> 00:29:59.950
And that's why
most materials have

00:29:59.950 --> 00:30:02.260
positive thermal expansion,
because essentially they

00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:06.250
get softer as you stretch them.

00:30:06.250 --> 00:30:09.690
So this is, for
example, for lithium,

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.150
the energy as a function of--

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.430
this is at room temperature--
as a function of volume.

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:17.220
So this would be the
room-temperature-equilibrium

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.180
lattice constant.

00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:20.610
And this is the free energy
as a function of volume,

00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:25.177
so this would be the
room-temperature-equilibrium

00:30:25.177 --> 00:30:25.885
lattice constant.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:45.250
OK.

00:30:45.250 --> 00:30:47.000
We're not going to say
much about the sort

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.770
of subtle details about how you
calculate thermal expansion.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:55.820
There is a sort of direct
assimilation approach,

00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:57.410
and that will be
the next lecture.

00:30:57.410 --> 00:30:59.990
So you could really just
do molecular dynamics,

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:03.260
which, again, we'll come to
later what that exactly means,

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.850
and equilibrate your cell size.

00:31:05.850 --> 00:31:08.450
The other is to
go more explicitly

00:31:08.450 --> 00:31:12.060
to a calculation of entropy
as a function of volume.

00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:16.547
And so the way you would
calculate the entropy is

00:31:16.547 --> 00:31:19.130
by calculating-- if you're only
going to deal with vibrational

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:19.760
entropy--

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.400
by calculating the
phonon density of states.

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:27.350
So literally you would look
at the quantized vibrations

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:30.262
through the statistical
mechanics on them.

00:31:30.262 --> 00:31:32.720
And those of you have taken
320 may have sort of remembered

00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:35.240
this and calculate the
free energy associated

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:36.050
with these phonons.

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.150
And I'll say a little
more about this later.

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:42.290
For example, this is a
phonon spectrum for silicon.

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:45.620
So you can actually quite
accurately calculate it.

00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:50.090
Remember that to get the
thermal expansion it's not

00:31:50.090 --> 00:31:53.960
enough to just phonons at
one volume, because you get

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.440
need to get the entropy
as a function of volume.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.330
So at a few different volumes--

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:01.280
that means you really
have to do the phonons

00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.550
at several different volumes
to get the thermal expansion

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:05.060
right.

00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:09.860
This sort of looks hard,
but phonon calculations

00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:12.560
have become quite routine.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:13.980
They're very well developed.

00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.480
There's, in some
cases, even, like,

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.775
codes that do it
almost semi automatic,

00:32:17.775 --> 00:32:21.860
which it's typically done either
by a linear response technique

00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.400
where you sort of
perturb a lattice really

00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:28.247
by a phonon with
short wavelength,

00:32:28.247 --> 00:32:30.330
so that you can really
calculate the energy of it.

00:32:30.330 --> 00:32:33.410
So this is like setting up
a supercell with a phonon

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:35.990
in it is called a frozen
phonon approximation.

00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:38.630
There are perturbation
techniques, linear response

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:39.260
techniques.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.420
And then some people
do it in real space

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.670
by calculating force
constants and setting up

00:32:43.670 --> 00:32:45.950
force constant
modulus for phonons.

00:32:51.560 --> 00:32:53.930
So here's sort of
the result that you

00:32:53.930 --> 00:33:00.980
would get in LDA and GGA for
copper with phonons only.

00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:03.470
Again, the LDA number
and the GGA number

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.425
bracket the experiment,
but I would say, overall,

00:33:06.425 --> 00:33:09.740
it seems to do very well.

00:33:09.740 --> 00:33:12.260
Again, I think what
you see is the LDA

00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:13.760
is a little on the stiff side.

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.920
The GGA is a little
on the soft side.

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.310
It's very typical for
these two in metals.

00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:21.590
So the LDA expands
a little less.

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.390
The GGA expands a little more.

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:26.510
But, you know, if you sort
of look at the scale here,

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:30.620
it's pretty amazing that this
effect comes out quite well.

00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:41.320
But what about other things?

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:46.990
Remember that the
thermal expansion comes

00:33:46.990 --> 00:33:49.600
from how the entropy
changes with volume,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.700
but that's the total entropy.

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.340
The calculation I
showed you only had

00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.780
the vibrational entropy in it.

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:57.670
OK?

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.040
So any other level
of excitations

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:05.840
that changes with volume can
affect your thermal expansion.

00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:09.260
And obvious one is the
electronic excitation.

00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:13.370
So any time you're not
working on an insulator,

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:16.429
you will start getting
electronic excitations.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:18.980
And can they change with volume?

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.040
And the answer is yes.

00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:23.870
What I'm showing
you here is that--

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:26.600
and I must admit I forgot
which material this is,

00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.070
which is really bad of me.

00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:31.800
But I'm pretty sure
it's the metal.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:36.109
So this is the ratio of the
electronic thermal expansion,

00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:38.300
which is unfortunately
called beta here not

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:41.340
alpha, to the total extent
of thermal expansion--

00:34:41.340 --> 00:34:45.090
the electronic plus
the vibrational one.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.690
And so what you see
is only at very--

00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.659
and this is on a reduced
temperature scale.

00:34:50.659 --> 00:34:53.429
This is the temperature in
units of the Debye temperature.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:56.850
Think of the Debye temperature
as sort of the temperature

00:34:56.850 --> 00:35:00.900
scale at which the vibrations
become classical, which,

00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:02.400
for a lot of
materials, it will be

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.550
somewhere in the order
of 200 to 500 Kelvin,

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:06.780
so it's not 1 Kelvin.

00:35:06.780 --> 00:35:09.780
It's not a million Kelvin.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:14.310
So what you see is only
at really low temperature

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:16.740
is the electronic
thermal expansion

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:18.730
important in these materials.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:21.628
Now why is it so important here?

00:35:21.628 --> 00:35:22.170
Anybody know?

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.956
It's actually because the
phonon one is really small.

00:35:30.956 --> 00:35:34.027
Remember this is the
ratio of the two.

00:35:34.027 --> 00:35:35.610
When you're at a
real low temperature,

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:39.030
the thermal expansion is
very small in general.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:40.860
And the reason is
you're essentially

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:44.410
harmonic in your phonon
degrees of freedom.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:48.230
So you have almost
no thermal expansion.

00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:52.100
If you have fully
harmonic vibrations,

00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:54.560
then the entropy does
not change with volume.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.740
Because if you are
in a quadratic,

00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:00.620
your curvature is
the same everywhere.

00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:01.190
OK?

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:04.170
So your frequency is
the same everywhere.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.040
Your phonon frequency
is the same,

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:08.190
so your entropy is
the same everywhere.

00:36:08.190 --> 00:36:10.520
So at very low temperature,
you have almost no

00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:12.720
phonon thermal expansion.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.850
So the electronic one plays an
important role, but all of them

00:36:16.850 --> 00:36:19.160
together are small anyway.

00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:21.500
And here when you only at, say--

00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.430
this is a logarithmic scale,
so let's say at roughly half

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:28.100
of the Debye temperature
the electronic effect

00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.660
is almost meaningless.

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:33.860
That doesn't mean there are not
some esoteric materials where

00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.570
it does become important.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.320
There are some materials--
sort of complex oxides

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:45.350
typically where you can start
inducing valence fluctuations

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.300
at elevated temperature.

00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:51.500
But even 300, 400 Kelvin.

00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.960
And in oxides, if you change
the valence of an ion,

00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:57.530
they sort of change size
because the orbitals

00:36:57.530 --> 00:36:58.850
are very localized.

00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.060
So there you can see a
substantial effect of electrons

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.090
on thermal expansion.

00:37:05.090 --> 00:37:08.210
But in many cases we
wouldn't worry about it.

00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:14.820
So that was the example
of thermal expansion.

00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.070
So there you have to worry
about phonons, maybe electrons.

00:37:21.730 --> 00:37:24.520
Here's another example where
you would absolutely need

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.410
a temperature-dependent study.

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:29.440
Here's the phase diagram
of titanium zirconium.

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:33.400
Titanium and zirconium are
both hexagonal close packed HCP

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:35.440
at low temperature.

00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:37.690
At high temperature,
they're actually both BCC.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:39.760
And so this is the
transition temperature

00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:41.343
on the titanium side.

00:37:41.343 --> 00:37:42.760
This is the
transition temperature

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.280
on the zirconium side.

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.410
Let's say you
wanted to know-- you

00:37:47.410 --> 00:37:50.560
wanted to be able to predict
such transition temperatures.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.780
So then you obviously need
to get the subtle energy

00:37:55.780 --> 00:37:59.710
difference between HCP
titanium and BCC titanium

00:37:59.710 --> 00:38:01.640
as a function of temperature.

00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:03.490
So you need to know
what contributes

00:38:03.490 --> 00:38:06.070
to the entropy of these phases.

00:38:06.070 --> 00:38:07.810
And you could say,
well, you know,

00:38:07.810 --> 00:38:10.940
I'm really good at
my initial stuff.

00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.072
So I'm going to do ab-initio
molecular dynamics.

00:38:15.072 --> 00:38:16.780
And again I'm running
a little bit ahead.

00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.870
Molecular dynamics
is essentially

00:38:18.870 --> 00:38:22.640
you let the atoms move according
to Newton's equation of motion.

00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:27.100
So it's essentially doing
the vibrations of the atoms.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.020
And if you do that,
essentially, you

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:32.860
include the vibrational
entropy in the system,

00:38:32.860 --> 00:38:36.550
because you've included
the displacement of atoms

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.520
as your model for
thermal excitation.

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.870
So that's the same
as vibrations.

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.767
So would you get
that transition?

00:38:48.433 --> 00:38:49.850
I mean, these are
questions you're

00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.040
going to be faced with
as you apply modeling.

00:38:55.942 --> 00:38:57.400
It's when you deal
with temperature

00:38:57.400 --> 00:39:00.070
that it becomes
unfortunately rather

00:39:00.070 --> 00:39:02.860
important to understand
the physics that

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.650
drives your phenomena.

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:08.300
So you can sort
make a blind choice.

00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:13.750
So let's say our ab-initio
Hamiltonian was perfect,

00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.730
like LDA or GGA had no errors.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:19.650
And then we do
molecular dynamics,

00:39:19.650 --> 00:39:21.640
so we let the atoms
kind of move around.

00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:24.640
And we have infinite
computer time.

00:39:24.640 --> 00:39:30.400
So we can sample long enough
and simulate long enough.

00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.230
Would we get that?

00:39:34.930 --> 00:39:37.870
I mean, the question
really translates to,

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:42.430
is that transition determined
by atomic vibrations?

00:39:42.430 --> 00:39:44.290
Because that's the
excitation mode

00:39:44.290 --> 00:39:47.410
you've allowed by doing
dynamics of atoms.

00:39:50.190 --> 00:39:50.960
I don't know.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.650
Do you know the answer?

00:39:52.650 --> 00:39:54.780
I don't.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.610
OK.

00:39:56.610 --> 00:39:57.880
I'm giving you a topic here.

00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:01.980
This is a hot topic of
discussion among people

00:40:01.980 --> 00:40:03.420
who do alloy theory.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:08.850
What drives these HCP to BCC
transitions, which are actually

00:40:08.850 --> 00:40:11.100
very common in
metals or anything

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.540
close-packed at low temperature
to something less close-packed.

00:40:15.540 --> 00:40:20.070
Most people will argue that
it is the atomic vibrations--

00:40:20.070 --> 00:40:23.710
that it's essentially a
vibrational entropy difference.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:24.540
OK?

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:28.500
The close-packed phase
tends to be stiffer.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:32.130
The less closed phase
tends to be softer.

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:34.800
Remember softer means
lower frequencies.

00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:37.200
Lower frequencies
means higher entropy.

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:40.202
Higher entropy means you become
favored at high temperature.

00:40:40.202 --> 00:40:41.910
I know it's a lot of
steps to go through,

00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:43.650
but if you've
never done thermal,

00:40:43.650 --> 00:40:46.650
you should get this by now.

00:40:46.650 --> 00:40:50.430
So if that's true, then
our perfect ab-initio MD

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:52.650
would get this transition.

00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:53.675
OK?

00:40:53.675 --> 00:40:55.050
But what about
other excitations?

00:40:55.050 --> 00:40:58.080
There are some people who claim
that this is really driven

00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:04.890
by electronic excitations,
because also BCC phases tend

00:41:04.890 --> 00:41:06.395
to have higher
electronic entropy.

00:41:06.395 --> 00:41:08.130
And I'll show in a
second why that is

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:10.290
and how you could
sort of know that.

00:41:10.290 --> 00:41:13.770
If that's the case, then
you shouldn't get this right

00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.390
just doing ab-initio MD.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:17.850
Then you should start
explicitly including

00:41:17.850 --> 00:41:20.700
the electronic
excitations, which can

00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.410
be done in ab-initio methods.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.240
But routinely it's
not done because it's

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.570
a pain in the butt.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:29.145
And remember we often--

00:41:29.145 --> 00:41:30.770
the problem is that,
as we do modeling,

00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:34.130
we often tend to
make approximations

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.760
not because we can justify
them but because we don't know

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:40.020
how to do them differently.

00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.422
We tend to make
approximations of convenience

00:41:42.422 --> 00:41:43.880
sometimes rather
than justify them.

00:41:49.190 --> 00:41:51.110
Here's another phase diagram.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.475
You think the same deal.

00:41:52.475 --> 00:41:53.150
Huh?

00:41:53.150 --> 00:41:55.190
This is copper gold.

00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:57.290
We just talked about
titanium zirconium,

00:41:57.290 --> 00:41:59.120
and there it was
either vibrations

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:01.640
or electronic excitations.

00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:05.160
Here it's totally-- it's
driven totally differently.

00:42:05.160 --> 00:42:07.640
These are FCC phases
copper and gold.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.500
And all these
compounds in between

00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.470
are ordered FCC compounds,
so they're really

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:16.620
just ordering of copper and
gold items on the FCC lattice.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.790
So this phase diagram is
completely driven by what we

00:42:19.790 --> 00:42:22.500
call configurational entropy.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.280
OK?

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.990
So it's by the
copper and the gold

00:42:24.990 --> 00:42:30.450
interchanging sites
on the FCC lattice.

00:42:30.450 --> 00:42:34.290
So if you wanted to model this
as a function of temperature,

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:37.630
you would need a model that
explicitly deals with that.

00:42:37.630 --> 00:42:41.072
And the vibrations, for example,
may be much less important.

00:42:41.072 --> 00:42:42.780
And actually they are
much less important

00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.480
in setting the topology
of that diagram.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.440
OK?

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.710
So different problems,
different physics.

00:42:49.710 --> 00:42:52.170
And it's going to lead
to different models

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:53.677
for dealing with temperature.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:59.770
And here's the ultimate one.

00:42:59.770 --> 00:43:01.930
I thought that
this didn't exist.

00:43:01.930 --> 00:43:09.250
For a long time, us alloy
theorists have wiped away

00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:11.357
electronic entropy
because we just

00:43:11.357 --> 00:43:12.940
don't know how to
deal with it, and we

00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:14.330
don't like to deal with it.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:18.560
So we write in paper saying
that it's not important,

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.530
but here's a system
that's completely

00:43:20.530 --> 00:43:22.690
driven by electronic entropy.

00:43:22.690 --> 00:43:25.450
Now agreed it's
slightly esoteric,

00:43:25.450 --> 00:43:28.120
it's vanadium oxide
which undergoes

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.710
metal-insulator transitions.

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.110
This is its phase diagram.

00:43:32.110 --> 00:43:33.910
And actually temperature
pressure space

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:35.410
since there's no
compositional axis,

00:43:35.410 --> 00:43:37.690
it's a stoichiometric compound.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:40.090
And at low temperature
and low pressure

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:42.927
it's an antiferromagnetic
insulator.

00:43:42.927 --> 00:43:44.510
If you actually raise
the temperature,

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:48.340
it becomes metallic
and changes structure.

00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.390
And it's completely driven by
the fact that, in the metal,

00:43:52.390 --> 00:43:55.060
the entropy of the
electrons is higher than

00:43:55.060 --> 00:43:57.880
in the antiferromagnetic
insulator.

00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:00.400
So this is one of these
things that, again, let's

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.110
go back to our ab-initio MD.

00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:05.950
Like, if it was
perfect, but all we

00:44:05.950 --> 00:44:09.910
did was let the atoms vibrate,
we should not get this right.

00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:11.200
OK?

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:13.120
And it's amazing some
people get it right,

00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.378
but, if you have completely
the wrong physics

00:44:16.378 --> 00:44:17.920
that you allow in
your model, there's

00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:21.040
no reason you should get
the phase behavior right.

00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:31.410
This one I like very much
because this is a topic

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.880
that many people deal with.

00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.400
This is a problem
of interface energy.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:39.060
This is simply calculating
the coherent interface

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:43.220
between silver and aluminum.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:44.990
They're both FCC metals.

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.150
So you put them
together, and you

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:48.590
calculate the interface energy.

00:44:48.590 --> 00:44:50.540
This is something
you very often need.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:55.460
And so this is that
interface as a function

00:44:55.460 --> 00:44:58.310
of-- interfacial energy as
a function of temperature.

00:44:58.310 --> 00:45:02.900
And the two types of dots
are different interface

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.890
orientations.

00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:04.490
And I forget.

00:45:04.490 --> 00:45:07.460
I think one is a 1, 1, 1
plane and one is a 1, 0, 0.

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.587
But I'm not absolutely
sure, and I forgot

00:45:09.587 --> 00:45:10.670
to put the reference data.

00:45:10.670 --> 00:45:12.128
This is out of
Mark [INAUDIBLE]'s's

00:45:12.128 --> 00:45:13.820
work in Northwestern.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:15.620
But I'll put the
reference on when

00:45:15.620 --> 00:45:17.810
I put the notes on the web.

00:45:17.810 --> 00:45:20.660
So obviously the
interfacial energy

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.020
goes down with temperature.

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.220
OK?

00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:25.800
And this is often
something you need

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.300
if you want to study wetting
and all that kind of cool stuff

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.353
and nucleation
problems and stuff.

00:45:30.353 --> 00:45:32.770
So the question is, where does
that temperature dependence

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:33.270
come from?

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.340
Because we've already had
sort of three different types

00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:43.137
of things induced
temperature phenomena.

00:45:43.137 --> 00:45:44.470
So where does it come from here?

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.120
Because if you don't
know that, your modeling

00:45:50.120 --> 00:45:51.560
is going to be irrelevant.

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:00.230
You can get a hint
from the fact that it's

00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:02.570
getting really a lot
smaller with temperature

00:46:02.570 --> 00:46:07.360
and actually kind of goes to 0.

00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:09.790
What would happen to that
interface as you heat it up?

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.425
I think you know afraid to say.

00:46:17.425 --> 00:46:17.925
Diffusion.

00:46:17.925 --> 00:46:18.960
Yeah.

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.510
It interdiffusers.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:27.490
Silver and aluminum are somewhat
immiscible at low temperature.

00:46:27.490 --> 00:46:32.830
But when you heated up silver
and aluminum interdiffused,

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:35.830
they actually don't form a full
solid solution until your way

00:46:35.830 --> 00:46:41.110
up, but they enter interdiffuse.

00:46:41.110 --> 00:46:44.050
So essentially what's happening
to that interface, that's

00:46:44.050 --> 00:46:46.468
sort of getting more diffuse.

00:46:46.468 --> 00:46:48.760
On the silver side, you have
a lot more aluminum atoms.

00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.880
And on the aluminum side, you
have a lot more silver atoms.

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.340
So it starts to look less
and less like an interface.

00:46:57.340 --> 00:47:00.610
And actually by here
near the interface

00:47:00.610 --> 00:47:03.560
you've reached almost
perfect solubility,

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:06.220
so that's why the
interface energy is 0.

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:07.600
So this is why--

00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.810
it's because of the interdiffuse
that the interface energy

00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:13.630
goes down.

00:47:13.630 --> 00:47:14.740
OK?

00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:19.630
So let's say that this was
experimental data that you'd

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:21.370
gotten.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:25.870
If you had no idea about the
physics from that interface,

00:47:25.870 --> 00:47:28.630
you would probably not
apply the right simulation.

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:31.420
Because if you took a hard
silver aluminum interface--

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.370
you know, pure silver,
pure aluminum--

00:47:33.370 --> 00:47:35.440
and had all the beautiful
stuff, you know.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.930
Temperature dependent, had
the vibrations, maybe even

00:47:37.930 --> 00:47:40.850
the electronic excitations--

00:47:40.850 --> 00:47:44.970
you will not even get
nearly close to the sensor,

00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:47.670
because the decrease
in interface energy

00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:50.110
with temperature is purely
driven by interdiffuse

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:51.470
in this case.

00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.970
OK?

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:05.960
Yes, sir?

00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.910
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:13.510
Or how is the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:48:16.062 --> 00:48:16.770
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:21.390
It's not just configurational
entropy that's driving it up.

00:48:21.390 --> 00:48:23.730
Well, how is it defined?

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:27.810
It's defined by looking at
the energy of the two pieces

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:33.030
together and then
the energy of the two

00:48:33.030 --> 00:48:36.360
in the bulk with the same
driving chemical potentials.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.443
It's a good question because
it is a little subtle,

00:48:39.443 --> 00:48:40.860
because they're
both open systems.

00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:43.440
That makes it a little subtle.

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:45.420
But what drives it is--

00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:48.420
it's the configurational
entropy that disorder it.

00:48:48.420 --> 00:48:51.607
But it's really the fact that--

00:48:51.607 --> 00:48:53.190
it's really the
temperature dependence

00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:54.600
of the interfacial energy.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.400
Because they become
so disordered,

00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:59.910
the energy of interaction
becomes almost nil--

00:48:59.910 --> 00:49:01.650
the effective energy
of interaction--

00:49:01.650 --> 00:49:04.230
because they basically look
the same on both sides.

00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:07.920
You have effectively no
interaction energy left.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:10.500
This is one that I
used to ask about.

00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.170
This is a thermal
conductivity uranium oxide.

00:49:13.170 --> 00:49:15.780
This is a really old result.
I have to find the reference.

00:49:15.780 --> 00:49:18.360
This is one of the very
early simulation results.

00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:20.265
That's why it's
on uranium oxide.

00:49:20.265 --> 00:49:21.640
I think I've told
you this story.

00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:24.330
Potential modeling in
oxide started in England

00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:26.220
with the nuclear
industry, and they

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:30.330
thought it'd be good to do
this on nuclear materials.

00:49:30.330 --> 00:49:35.047
So here's the calculated
thermal conductivity

00:49:35.047 --> 00:49:36.630
as a function of
temperature, and I'll

00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:38.910
tell you how to calculate this.

00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:41.910
To calculate this-- literally
by doing a molecular dynamics

00:49:41.910 --> 00:49:48.180
simulation looking
at essentially energy

00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.920
transport through phonons.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.030
And the way you have--

00:49:51.030 --> 00:49:55.740
thermal expansion is caused
by phonons scattering.

00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.360
You have a phonon going through.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.910
And at some point, it needs
to sort of-- that wave packet

00:49:59.910 --> 00:50:01.350
needs to become decoherent.

00:50:01.350 --> 00:50:04.780
It's scattered, so it
can deliver its energy.

00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:10.390
But essentially heat
conduction comes--

00:50:10.390 --> 00:50:11.980
at least some form
of heat conduction

00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:13.688
comes from phonon transport.

00:50:13.688 --> 00:50:14.980
And that's what the calculated.

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.590
What's the brown curve?

00:50:17.590 --> 00:50:21.070
And then the purple
curve of the experiment--

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:23.260
and you see something
kind of odd here.

00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.230
There's obviously a whole
region of temperature

00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:28.000
really good agreement.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.910
If I'd written a paper,
I'd shown just that part.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:41.840
But then suddenly above
2,000, the two really diverge.

00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.680
And when you see
something like this,

00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.100
it should always, like,
make a light on there.

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.540
The physics must be changing.

00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:53.620
So uranium oxide
is an insulator.

00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:55.920
The fluoride or antifluorite
structure, I think.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:01.670
You're pretty high up
here 2,000 degrees.

00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:04.130
What happens here
is that you start

00:51:04.130 --> 00:51:05.840
getting an electronic
contribution

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:07.610
to the thermal conductivity.

00:51:07.610 --> 00:51:11.130
When you start having
hot electrons--

00:51:11.130 --> 00:51:12.860
essentially electrons
that can move--

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.020
they carry with
them thermal energy.

00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.990
I mean, it's the basis of
the thermoelectric effect.

00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:21.170
It's the Seebeck coefficient--
the Peltier coefficient.

00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:24.050
So at high temperature,
you typically

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:27.200
see a contribution
of the electrons

00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.400
to the thermal conductivity.

00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.590
In most materials
at low temperature,

00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:33.560
the electronic thermal
conductivity is small.

00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.620
It's largely
dominated by phonons.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.360
But in a lot of
materials it does start

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:39.830
to show up at high temperature.

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:41.420
And now what's high
and low depends

00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:46.820
a little bit on whether you
have a metal or an insulator.

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:48.755
If you have a really
big bandgap insulator,

00:51:48.755 --> 00:51:50.990
they will never show up
because you will never

00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:52.250
have mobile electrons.

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:01.640
So that was kind of the intro
to set the stage that you have

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:05.840
to think of the excitations
that you want to deal with when

00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.513
you work with temperature.

00:52:07.513 --> 00:52:08.930
Now I was going
to sort of quickly

00:52:08.930 --> 00:52:12.200
go through the two
big lines of approach,

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.290
and this is really a
kind of table of contents

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:17.750
for the rest of the course.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:20.750
One approach is to
simulate dynamics.

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:22.710
And this is what I've
talked about before.

00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:24.440
This is what's called
molecular dynamics.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.148
And Professor Marzari
is going to lecture

00:52:26.148 --> 00:52:28.040
on that for several lectures.

00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:32.900
Essentially, it's
Newtonian motion for atoms.

00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:37.340
You say you've got a
bunch of atoms together.

00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:39.470
On each of them, I can
calculate the force

00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:40.790
coming from the other ones.

00:52:44.768 --> 00:52:48.920
Force is minus the
gradient of the energy.

00:52:53.218 --> 00:52:55.260
So it's the derivative of
the energy with respect

00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.880
to the positions of the atoms.

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.190
And then you say, you know,
I know Newton's equation

00:52:59.190 --> 00:52:59.700
of motion.

00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:04.710
Force tells me the
acceleration, so F equals ma.

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:09.810
So if I know the
force, I know how much

00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:11.650
to accelerate that atom.

00:53:11.650 --> 00:53:13.800
And so you
essentially keep track

00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:16.470
of velocities of
atoms and positions,

00:53:16.470 --> 00:53:18.720
and you do a
numerical integration

00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:21.030
of the Newtonian
equations of motion.

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:22.620
That's all molecular
dynamics is.

00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:26.040
And you do that a lot, a
lot, a lot, a lot of times.

00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:29.460
So you track the
dynamics of atoms.

00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:31.800
How do you set the temperature--

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:32.700
sort of a cool thing.

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:34.380
I mean, Professor
Marzari will go

00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:35.700
into this in much more detail.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.280
But the temperature
is essentially

00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:40.090
the energy in your system.

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:44.520
But remember that Newtonian
dynamics is energy conserving.

00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:48.030
So if you do your
Newtonian dynamics perfect,

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:51.180
then whatever energy you've
put in in the beginning

00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.160
is whatever energy
you'll have at the end.

00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:56.310
So the temperature
of your system

00:53:56.310 --> 00:54:00.450
is determined by the
energy input you started.

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:03.180
And what people typically
do in simulations

00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:05.490
is that, if it's not quite
right the way you started,

00:54:05.490 --> 00:54:07.820
you sort of adjust it on the go.

00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:09.360
You take out a
little bit of energy.

00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.300
You put it back in if you want
to adjust the temperature.

00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:17.070
Again, you'll hear a lot more
of that in the coming lectures.

00:54:17.070 --> 00:54:20.490
And there are flavors
of this depending

00:54:20.490 --> 00:54:21.948
on how you get your forces.

00:54:21.948 --> 00:54:23.490
It's all the same
molecular dynamics.

00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:26.580
But if you get your forces from
empirical potential models,

00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.140
then it goes fast--

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:31.110
your force calculation--
because calculating the energy

00:54:31.110 --> 00:54:32.430
in empirical potential is fast.

00:54:32.430 --> 00:54:34.990
If you get it from
quantum mechanics,

00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:37.860
then it's called ab-initio
molecular dynamics.

00:54:37.860 --> 00:54:39.930
And then it's slower.

00:54:39.930 --> 00:54:42.730
You have to get your forces
from quantum mechanics,

00:54:42.730 --> 00:54:45.367
but it's the same molecular
dynamics essentially.

00:54:47.970 --> 00:54:48.470
Oh.

00:54:56.730 --> 00:55:01.068
So that's the first approach
to simulate the dynamics.

00:55:01.068 --> 00:55:02.610
The other one, which
we'll also deal,

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:05.110
is to go through
statistical mechanics.

00:55:05.110 --> 00:55:07.470
I mean, we sort of know
how to average over

00:55:07.470 --> 00:55:09.030
microscopic degrees of freedom.

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:11.550
And that's what's statistical
mechanics tells us.

00:55:11.550 --> 00:55:14.740
And in some cases that
will be more advantageous.

00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:16.980
So you build some
approximate model

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:19.380
for the degrees of freedom.

00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.870
You try to get the energetics
for those degrees of freedom.

00:55:21.870 --> 00:55:23.730
And then rather
than simulating, you

00:55:23.730 --> 00:55:26.790
sort of do some more analytical
or numerical integration

00:55:26.790 --> 00:55:29.005
of them and get,
say, temperature

00:55:29.005 --> 00:55:29.880
dependent properties.

00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:32.605
And we'll show
you that as well--

00:55:32.605 --> 00:55:33.230
how to do that.

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:42.150
So you can kind of see that this
is what we're going to cover.

00:55:42.150 --> 00:55:45.150
I just wanted to give you
perspective on what's coming.

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:48.420
The sort of first piece here,
this is a direct simulation.

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.100
We do molecular dynamics.

00:55:50.100 --> 00:55:54.030
And then the rest here,
kind of largely this piece,

00:55:54.030 --> 00:56:00.340
is sort of more, I
would say, stat mech

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:06.250
and making relevant models
for your degrees of freedom

00:56:06.250 --> 00:56:08.890
that are not obtainable
by direct simulation.

00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:10.690
And then this, the
rest here, is kind

00:56:10.690 --> 00:56:14.470
of a bunch of case studies
and separate applications.

00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:26.220
OK.

00:56:26.220 --> 00:56:39.690
I wanted to get out of
this and show you a movie.

00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:49.600
So here's a molecular dynamic
simulation of a planetary gear.

00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:51.450
I don't know if you've
ever seen this one.

00:56:51.450 --> 00:56:52.980
It's one of the
totally crazy ones.

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:59.190
So somebody had the idea
that you could make--

00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:02.560
in the world of nano, you
could make a nano gear.

00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.960
So these are
actually molecules--

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:04.860
let me run it again.

00:57:11.090 --> 00:57:14.867
You see the molecules in
the center turn faster,

00:57:14.867 --> 00:57:16.700
and they kind of rotate
over the other ones.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:22.260
And the outer
circle runs slower.

00:57:22.260 --> 00:57:25.200
And this is done by solving
Newton's equations of motion

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.890
essentially for these molecules.

00:57:28.890 --> 00:57:29.970
I'll show you one more.

00:57:36.249 --> 00:57:37.460
No, it's not the right one.

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:43.180
Oh, here we go.

00:57:43.180 --> 00:57:46.495
This is buckyballs shot
onto a silicon surface.

00:57:50.770 --> 00:57:52.980
So you can sort of
see they kind of--

00:57:52.980 --> 00:57:54.240
some stick.

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.200
Some get shot at it.

00:57:55.200 --> 00:57:58.090
Some stick, and
some bounce back up.

00:57:58.090 --> 00:58:00.205
And they kind of vibrate
on the silicon surface.

00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:09.010
And so this is all done
simply by integrating

00:58:09.010 --> 00:58:10.660
Newton's equation of motion.

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:23.470
From

00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:25.280
OK.

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:34.740
Let me go back to the lecture
before you get totally enamored

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:35.510
by the movies.

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:40.050
OK.

00:58:42.973 --> 00:58:44.640
I'm going to say a
little bit about sort

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:48.319
of which route to go when you
want to deal with temperature.

00:58:54.376 --> 00:58:56.250
You know, an obvious
way is always

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:59.700
to do the direct dynamics
through molecular dynamics.

00:58:59.700 --> 00:59:02.370
It's a powerful approach.

00:59:02.370 --> 00:59:07.110
It's, in particular,
powerful to see phenomena

00:59:07.110 --> 00:59:11.610
that you didn't even know were
there, because in almost all

00:59:11.610 --> 00:59:14.970
the other approximate approaches
we're going to do for dynamics

00:59:14.970 --> 00:59:19.650
or temperature, we're going
to assume that we know

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:22.350
and understand the phenomena
that are responsible

00:59:22.350 --> 00:59:25.020
for the macroscopic
behavior we see.

00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.430
In some sense,
molecular dynamics

00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:30.122
is the only way where
you don't presume much.

00:59:30.122 --> 00:59:32.330
I mean, you presume something
about your Hamiltonian,

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:33.205
your energy function.

00:59:33.205 --> 00:59:35.790
But otherwise, you just
kind of let the system run,

00:59:35.790 --> 00:59:37.290
and you see what happens.

00:59:37.290 --> 00:59:39.130
What you have to keep
in mind, of course,

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:46.260
is that the timescale over which
you run is extremely short.

00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:52.320
I mean, you're now living on
the time in the world of atoms.

00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:59.430
And atoms vibrate, let's say,
somewhere between 1 terahertz

00:59:59.430 --> 01:00:00.360
maybe 10 terahertz.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.568
That's actually pretty high--

01:00:01.568 --> 01:00:03.730
10 terahertz.

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:08.380
So that would be 10 to
the 13 times per second.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:11.200
And remember you have to
integrate equations of motion.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.920
So think of an atom
vibrating in some well

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.900
or against another atom.

01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.950
You probably need at least
10 discretization steps

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.470
along that one vibration.

01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:24.870
So your time step is
of the order of 10

01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:26.410
to the minus 15 seconds--

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:27.840
10 to the 14 seconds.

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.608
That's sort of the
order of magnitude.

01:00:29.608 --> 01:00:31.650
For different materials
and different algorithms,

01:00:31.650 --> 01:00:32.550
it will be different.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:35.130
That's 10 femtoseconds.

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:37.860
So you have to kind of do
an iteration step every 10

01:00:37.860 --> 01:00:39.150
femtoseconds.

01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:42.600
So that means even if you
do 100,000 time steps,

01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.820
you still only have
1 nanosecond of time.

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:46.840
OK?

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.400
And so you'll see typical--

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:51.100
and these simulations are
in the order of picoseconds

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:53.290
to 100 nanoseconds.

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:56.440
Those are really
long simulations.

01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.880
And it's amazing, but you can
see a lot of important physics

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.570
recurring on that
timescale-- sometimes

01:01:02.570 --> 01:01:07.030
the reaction between molecules
or absorption resorption

01:01:07.030 --> 01:01:08.950
phenomena.

01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:11.680
If you sort of want to do, and
the first thing you should do

01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:15.100
is a back-of-the-envelope
calculation is the phenomenon

01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:17.830
that I want to see,
or that I hope to see,

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:20.560
does it live anywhere
near this time scale?

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.600
And sometimes you can
give the system help.

01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.120
You can raise the
temperature, because stuff

01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.202
will happen faster.

01:01:27.202 --> 01:01:28.660
But you should
realize that there's

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:32.590
certain stuff that you do not
see on this time scale at all.

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:35.950
There are people who
study solidification out

01:01:35.950 --> 01:01:38.320
of liquids within d.

01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:40.390
And, you know, there
may be even some here.

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:43.510
It's stupid period.

01:01:43.510 --> 01:01:46.930
You do not see anything
relevant on this time

01:01:46.930 --> 01:01:50.380
scale that has to do with
any real solidification.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:54.460
The only thing you can do is
enormously super cool a liquid,

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:57.430
overdrive it, and
really sort of induce

01:01:57.430 --> 01:02:00.100
extremely fast crystallization
which has nothing

01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:02.170
to do with real solidification.

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:07.400
And so the one example I
give is diffusion in solids.

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:10.730
You can do dynamics
on fast diffusers,

01:02:10.730 --> 01:02:12.440
but most things are
not fast diffusers.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.378
So I did a--

01:02:13.378 --> 01:02:15.170
I show you the kind of
back-of-the-envelope

01:02:15.170 --> 01:02:18.020
calculation you should do.

01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:20.510
A diffusivity is a
length scale squared

01:02:20.510 --> 01:02:24.680
times the jump rate,
where a is essentially

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:26.870
the distance which you jump.

01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:27.830
OK?

01:02:27.830 --> 01:02:32.420
So if you take a relatively fast
diffusion at room temperature

01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.120
10 to the minus 14 centimeters
squared per second,

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:38.850
it's a respectable diffusivity
at room temperature.

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:40.940
Most materials, you
would never see that.

01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:43.160
It's not quite a
fast diffuser yet.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:46.160
This number would be more
at 10 to the minus 11, 10

01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.110
to the minus 12.

01:02:48.110 --> 01:02:50.750
And you take a jump
length of 1 Angstrom.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:53.810
So that's 10 miles
18 centimeter.

01:02:53.810 --> 01:03:00.150
Then you can show that the jump
rate is about 100 per second.

01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:05.390
So if you have a 10 to
the minus 14 diffusivity,

01:03:05.390 --> 01:03:11.510
an atom jumps about 100 times
per second, or about 1 times

01:03:11.510 --> 01:03:14.070
per 10 milliseconds.

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:16.550
So do you see now the
enormous disparity

01:03:16.550 --> 01:03:26.160
in time scale from 1
nanosecond to 10 milliseconds?

01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:29.960
So you could wait forever in
your dynamics to see things

01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:33.350
if you're sort of not smart.

01:03:33.350 --> 01:03:34.580
You'll see similar phenomena.

01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:36.440
Like, you could study.

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.770
You could use dynamics to look
at, say, surface deposition.

01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:42.950
Let's say molecular beam
epitaxy or something

01:03:42.950 --> 01:03:45.770
like that where you lay
down layer by later.

01:03:45.770 --> 01:03:50.300
If you actually do the math
in a real MB experiment,

01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:52.950
you tend to lay down about
one layer per second.

01:03:52.950 --> 01:03:55.140
That's the order of magnitude.

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:59.820
So you can actually never get
that by direct simulation.

01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:01.400
So what do people do?

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.980
Well, people do the
short simulations

01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:08.090
to extract useful information
that they can then

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:11.300
use in other models
to get the real time

01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:12.900
scales that they want.

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.800
And so that's some of the
things we're going to teach you.

01:04:22.890 --> 01:04:23.480
OK.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.105
Probably going to
run out of time here.

01:04:25.105 --> 01:04:31.040
But the other option--

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:32.390
so if you don't.

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:34.160
If you cannot do the dynamics--

01:04:34.160 --> 01:04:36.320
is to use statistical
mechanics and sort of

01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:39.110
integrate as far of the
length scale and time scale

01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:40.340
as you can.

01:04:40.340 --> 01:04:44.420
And just those of you
who may have never seen

01:04:44.420 --> 01:04:50.060
statistical mechanics, I'm going
to now totally confuse you.

01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:54.620
But the essential ideas are
sort of in these four equations

01:04:54.620 --> 01:05:01.040
that you now consider
a macroscopic state

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.470
as a collection of
microscopic states

01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:06.470
that you can
fluctuate in between.

01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:10.340
The probability for each
of these microscopic states

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.490
is proportional to the
exponential of minus beta

01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:17.160
that the energy, and
beta is 1 over kT.

01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:21.730
So what does that mean?

01:05:21.730 --> 01:05:24.820
Microscopic states
with low energy

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:28.330
show up with high probability,
and microscopic stage

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:32.740
with high energy shell up with
with very low probability.

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.780
Makes sense.

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:37.480
The sum of all
these unnormalized

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:40.780
probability terms is called
the partition function.

01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.180
And you can show that knowledge
of the partition function

01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:45.547
is exactly the same as
knowledge of the free energy.

01:05:45.547 --> 01:05:47.380
The free energy is
essentially the logarithm

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.030
of the partition function.

01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:53.230
And the entropy is the product
of the probability times

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:56.180
the log of the probability
summed over these things.

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:59.110
And again, that makes
sense because if you

01:05:59.110 --> 01:06:03.700
are in one microscopic
state, then pi

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:07.340
is 1 for that micro state
and 0 for all the other ones.

01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.280
So 1 log 1 0.

01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:10.990
And 0 log 0 is also 0.

01:06:10.990 --> 01:06:12.550
So your entropy is 0.

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:15.160
So you have no disorder.

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.350
So if your macroscopic
state leads

01:06:17.350 --> 01:06:20.770
to only one microscopic
realization that you can beam,

01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:22.060
then you have zero entropy.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:25.540
It's when you can be in multiple
different microscopic states

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.460
that you have entropy.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.560
So you can think of
atomic vibrations,

01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.390
for example, as
really going between

01:06:31.390 --> 01:06:36.580
different microscopic states
of the positions of the atoms.

01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:38.080
You can think of
electronic entropy

01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:42.400
as going between different
electronic microscopic states.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:52.940
OK.

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.315
So I want to show
you one example

01:06:54.315 --> 01:06:56.780
and probably end with that.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.790
Electronic entropy.

01:06:58.790 --> 01:07:00.470
It's one that, on
the face of it,

01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:03.305
looks very difficult
to deal with,

01:07:03.305 --> 01:07:05.180
because you have to deal
with the excitations

01:07:05.180 --> 01:07:06.210
of the electron.

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:11.010
But actually in many cases it's
much easier than you think.

01:07:11.010 --> 01:07:13.040
If you solve the
Kohn-Sham equations,

01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:19.730
you get the eigenstates i and
the eigenvalues for the energy.

01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:21.860
And typically we
tend to treat these

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:25.540
as one electron eigenstates.

01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:26.920
So we sort of fill--

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.010
we think of filling these
with an electron, where

01:07:29.010 --> 01:07:30.843
we have a bunch of them,
and we fill them up

01:07:30.843 --> 01:07:32.460
to the Fermi level.

01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:35.582
There's actually nothing in
the theory of density function

01:07:35.582 --> 01:07:38.040
that tells you that they are
one-electron eigenstates where

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:40.150
we treat them like that.

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:42.810
So if you think of--

01:07:42.810 --> 01:07:45.990
I have a bunch of.

01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:48.580
Let's say I draw them
as discrete levels,

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:50.550
a bunch of energy levels--

01:07:50.550 --> 01:07:51.528
E1, E2.

01:07:51.528 --> 01:07:53.070
And, of course, in
a solid, this will

01:07:53.070 --> 01:07:54.315
become a density of states.

01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:00.170
What's the level of uncertainty?

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:02.350
What do I need to
know to characterize

01:08:02.350 --> 01:08:03.970
my electronic configuration?

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:06.370
All I need to know is, is
the level occupied or not?

01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:12.770
So I can characterize
my electronic state

01:08:12.770 --> 01:08:15.560
by saying which levels
are occupied or not.

01:08:22.300 --> 01:08:24.637
So if you do this
on a solid now where

01:08:24.637 --> 01:08:26.470
you have a real density
of states-- and I've

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:28.390
shown you one here.

01:08:28.390 --> 01:08:31.300
So this is a density
of electron states.

01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:33.189
This is energy.

01:08:33.189 --> 01:08:35.649
And forget the
bottom piece here.

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:37.899
Just think of the top.

01:08:37.899 --> 01:08:39.410
These are actually
spin polarized.

01:08:39.410 --> 01:08:43.689
One is in the up dos,
and one is the down dos.

01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:45.550
So my Fermi level--

01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:46.990
I don't know.

01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:50.050
It's actually at 0 here, but
that makes it less interesting.

01:08:50.050 --> 01:08:55.819
Let me assume the Fermi
level is at minus 2 here.

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:59.149
So at 0 temperature
I feel all the states

01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:01.040
below the Fermi level.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:03.160
OK?

01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:07.090
At elevated temperature, you
know you apply the Fermi-Dirac

01:09:07.090 --> 01:09:11.260
distribution function,
and so you'll

01:09:11.260 --> 01:09:15.200
have a filling that's
maybe a little different.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.700
And I'm kind of exaggerating.

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.075
The width of the Fermi-Dirac
distribution function is not

01:09:19.075 --> 01:09:19.640
nearly--

01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:21.500
so it's 1 here and 0 here.

01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.979
It's not nearly as wide
at reasonable temperature.

01:09:24.979 --> 01:09:27.859
So how can you get the entropy?

01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:30.979
Well, you can get the
entropy from the probability

01:09:30.979 --> 01:09:34.819
that each electronic state
is filled or unfilled.

01:09:34.819 --> 01:09:35.600
OK?

01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:39.680
So if f is the probability
that it's filled--

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:42.859
so this is the entropy coming
from when the state is filled,

01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:45.770
the entropy coming from
when the state is unfiled,

01:09:45.770 --> 01:09:49.729
and the sum over all
these possibilities

01:09:49.729 --> 01:09:52.560
is the electronic entropy.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:56.000
So if, in ab-initio calculation,
you calculate the density

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.900
of states, you actually have
a trivial way of getting out

01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:02.090
the electronic entropy.

01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:04.430
And this is-- getting
the density of states

01:10:04.430 --> 01:10:06.510
is really rather simple.

01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:08.870
So you just smear it with
the Fermi-Dirac distribution

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:11.060
function, and you sum--

01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:14.210
or you do this as an integral
typically rather than summing.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:19.490
And you have the
electronic entropy.

01:10:19.490 --> 01:10:22.500
It's very simple to do.

01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:26.660
So just as sort of a caution,
what I should tell you

01:10:26.660 --> 01:10:29.750
is that usually this
works very well,

01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:32.750
but the fundamental
underlying approximation

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:35.190
lies in the starting point.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:38.060
It's in assuming
that the epsilon I's,

01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:42.020
or the eigenvalues,
are the eigenstates

01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:44.960
of the real electron system.

01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.910
So what I'm
essentially saying is

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:50.900
that if you excite an
electron or remove one

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:54.530
from the occupied states,
you're essentially

01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:58.100
perturbing the system exactly
by that energy of that state

01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.100
that I took out.

01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:03.890
If I have a Kohn-Sham
eigenvalue of 3 electron

01:11:03.890 --> 01:11:09.140
volts with some eigenstate, and
I put the electron in there,

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.750
I'm assuming that that's
exactly the perturbation

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:15.080
that a real electron
will do in the system.

01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:17.162
If you go back at the
theory of density function,

01:11:17.162 --> 01:11:18.620
there is nothing
in the theory that

01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:20.510
tells you that that's right.

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:21.040
OK?

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:24.680
Remember density function
theory is based on the density?

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:28.640
And the Kohn-Sham idea was
essentially the smart way

01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:32.210
of writing the density in terms
of things that look like one

01:11:32.210 --> 01:11:36.530
electron orbital
but they aren't.

01:11:36.530 --> 01:11:37.190
OK?

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:40.940
So an eigenstate
densely function theory

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:43.400
is not a one-electron orbit.

01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:46.250
We just hope it is, and it
sometimes looks like it is.

01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:48.000
But it's not.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.740
And if it's not, then you
can describe excitations

01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:56.000
of electrons as going between
one Kohn-Sham eigenstate

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.910
to another Kohn-Sham
eigenstate because they're not

01:11:58.910 --> 01:12:00.730
one electron eigenstate.

01:12:00.730 --> 01:12:01.250
OK?

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:05.080
So what we are doing
is completely hokey.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.930
It's just that, in reasonable
materials and metals

01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:09.880
and semiconductors,
they don't look

01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:11.980
very much like
one-election eigenstate,

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:13.780
and this stuff works.

01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:17.320
Where it breaks
down is typically

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.690
in materials with very high
degrees of correlation,

01:12:19.690 --> 01:12:23.170
transition metal oxides, where
these things don't look at all

01:12:23.170 --> 01:12:24.580
like one-electron eigenstates.

01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:26.620
Because what happens in
those is, as soon as you

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:31.020
do an electron excitation, the
whole underlying eigenvalue

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.740
spectrum changes.

01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:33.240
OK?

01:12:33.240 --> 01:12:35.760
And remember then it's
not an eigenstate.

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:39.880
An eigenstate is supposed to
be orthogonal to the rest.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:43.980
So if filling or
unfilling it changes

01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:45.507
the occupation of
all the other ones

01:12:45.507 --> 01:12:47.340
and the wave function
of all the other ones,

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.250
then it wasn't an eigenstate.

01:12:50.250 --> 01:12:53.100
So there this stuff fails.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:54.310
I'm kind of out of time.

01:12:54.310 --> 01:12:59.340
So what I was going
to do was show you

01:12:59.340 --> 01:13:01.530
the next picture, which you
may just have a look at.

01:13:01.530 --> 01:13:06.600
It shows just the contribution
of the electronic entropy

01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.920
and the vibration
entropy in metals

01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.920
as a function of temperature,
so you can sort of

01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:14.013
see how they compare
to each other.

01:13:14.013 --> 01:13:15.180
So actually let me end here.

01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:19.500
And we'll see you
back on Tuesday.

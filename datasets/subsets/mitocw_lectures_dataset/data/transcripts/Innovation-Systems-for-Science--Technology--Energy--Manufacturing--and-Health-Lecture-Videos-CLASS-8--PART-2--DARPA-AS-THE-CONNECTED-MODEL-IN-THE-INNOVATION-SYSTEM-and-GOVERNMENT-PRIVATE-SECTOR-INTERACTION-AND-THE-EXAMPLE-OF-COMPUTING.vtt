WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Rasheed, why don't you

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.080
give us that point that you
were making to me about DARPA.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.670
RASHEED: Yes, so DARPA relies
very heavily on this program

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.540
manager structure.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.220
So they give these program
managers a lot of power

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.320
and a lot of leeway to
do whatever they want.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.950
But they have-- they have to
have a very distinct vision

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.840
from the outset,
like really when they

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.540
start to be able to do things.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.658
And so I was concerned that
these program managers were

00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:51.700
going to basically be
coming from the same places

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.605
over and over again, and so
have very similar visions.

00:00:54.605 --> 00:00:56.230
And you're going to
be able to miss out

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.760
on a lot of
different talent that

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.040
exists outside, or a lot
of different new projects,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.220
or new fields, maybe,
just like you're talking

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:06.490
about-- these new
collaboration between biology

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.000
and kind of humans and computer
science, things like that.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.860
But that was really
my main concern,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:17.570
was program managers
weren't being chosen as--

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.290
equitably isn't the word,
but that the selection

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.767
process of these program
managers was actually--

00:01:22.767 --> 00:01:23.600
might be too narrow.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.280
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: But
they do get visionaries.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.488
STUDENT: Sometimes.

00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:32.280
I mean, I think we
mentioned that they only

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.338
got white males [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.540
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
OK, so I'm going

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.940
to move us to Tammy Carleton.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.500
And Tammy's big
perception about DARPA

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.890
is this vision perception, that
that's a critical factor that

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.780
makes DARPA different.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.940
And there is a
process that DARPA

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.920
has developed for this radical
technological visioning.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.880
And essentially, she argues that
there's six stages that they

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.139
use to kind of get there.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:11.050
First, recruitment
of great talent--

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.600
and the talent, they
hear about talent

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.870
from this DARPA network,
which is now quite huge.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.720
Because all of the people that
get DARPA contracts and awards,

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.180
they stay in this
kind of DARPA family.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.460
And typically, researchers
love to work for DARPA.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:31.480
Because working on DARPA-hard
problems is really intriguing.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.780
So that's a community that
tends to know each other,

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.370
and be in communication,
as well as

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.920
the community of former DARPA
program managers and officials.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.800
So a lot of the talent
comes through that network,

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.090
which kind of knows
what's going to work.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.120
So the recruitment and the
vision get united in a way,

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.160
in that recruitment process.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.402
Then comes the stage of
the vision formulation.

00:02:57.402 --> 00:02:59.110
The program manager
has got to figure out

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.080
what they're going to do with
their four or five years.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.920
And they've got to
formulate a radical vision,

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.800
a right/left vision,
what's going to come out

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.217
of that pipeline, and what's
the fundamental research that

00:03:11.217 --> 00:03:13.450
going to get me there.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.570
And it's driving for
that breakthrough that's

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.330
the organizing proposition.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.010
Then, they've got to
go through defining

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.260
a program and its launch.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.500
Often, they will
have a workshop,

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.090
an invitation-only
workshop, where

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.270
they'll assemble 25, 30, 40
of the kind of best thinkers

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.320
on a project area, and
meet for a day or two days.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.620
I've watched one of those,
which got held up at MIT as part

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.980
of the beginnings of creating
this Biological Technologies

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.000
office.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.210
And they brought in just
an amazing collection,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.940
from MIT and from
elsewhere, of thinkers

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.040
about what some of
the early projects

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.630
might be to achieve some
of these capabilities.

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.520
So the Deputy Director
of DARPA came up,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.202
and kind of helped
run this workshop

00:04:05.202 --> 00:04:06.160
and think this through.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.870
The office wasn't
set up for a while

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.540
until the next DARPA
director, but it really

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.720
helped contribute
to that portfolio.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.190
And it was a really
serious effort.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:23.320
So the program manager
develops a portfolio approach

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.090
of standing up a
series of groups

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.090
that are going to be working on
this, and inter-relating them.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.940
And the program
manager is also going

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.635
to be responsible for making
this technology transfer.

00:04:33.635 --> 00:04:35.260
So in other words,
it's not enough just

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.190
to do something cool.

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:38.800
You've got to move it into
the implementation stage.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.520
And how is that going to happen?

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.300
So the program manager
has got to undertake

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.810
all of these various steps.

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.220
So the criteria for
being DARPA hard

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.460
is that the project has
to be technologically very

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.160
challenging.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.120
It's got to extend beyond the
current limits of technology

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.050
and knowledge.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.900
Otherwise, they don't
really want to do it.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:04.280
It's got to be actionable,
which means it can be made.

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.670
It can be built.
It can be produced.

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:09.580
So if it can't be, why do it?

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.080
You've got to be
able to demonstrate

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.940
that it's actionable.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.860
Typically
multidisciplinary-- that it's

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:17.800
going to draw on a variety
of areas of expertise.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.000
It's got to be far reaching.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.650
It's got to change things.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.640
It's got to be very
ambitious at a big scale.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.280
"Don't do little things" is
kind of a DARPA sub-rule.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.980
And various techniques
to flesh out the vision

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.050
include those
expert-only workshops,

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.170
and a proof of concept effort.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.450
Sometimes, if it's some
idea that looks promising,

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:42.880
they'll do what DARPA calls
a "seedling," just put

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.190
a little money on it,
and let somebody play

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.680
with it, a real
thinker play with it,

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.380
and see what it might
materialize into.

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.080
So they've got that
seedling capability.

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:57.138
There is no training system
for program managers.

00:05:57.138 --> 00:05:58.930
They don't go through
any kind of training.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:00.880
They just arrive.

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.133
And they kind of learn
from other program managers

00:06:05.133 --> 00:06:06.300
what they're supposed to do.

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:10.390
So there's a very strong
kind of DARPA culture

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.600
about how it operates, that gets
communicated by word of mouth

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.870
and kind of learning by doing.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.260
And it's informal exchange,
but there is a very strong kind

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.170
of operating rules set.

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.060
DARPA program
managers really have

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.900
to be quite entrepreneurial.

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.470
And Martine, you were
raising this earlier.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.720
They've got to stand up
a whole new territory.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.550
And to do that,
they've got to be

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.440
highly entrepreneurial about
how to bring that about.

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.030
And the decision to stand
up a vision program--

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.100
this is not set up
through peer review.

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.860
There isn't consensus
decision-making at DARPA.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.850
That program manager has got
to have a really strong vision,

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:58.060
and it's got to get
really organized.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.600
And then it's got to
withstand the office director

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:06.310
and then the DARPA director
really tearing through it,

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.110
and really analyzing it.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.390
So once you get that,
though, the approvals

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:13.000
can be very fast,
once the decision is

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.160
made to stand something up.

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.590
And that the program
manager really is--

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.080
to go back to that term
that you liked, Steph--

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.380
a vision champion.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.600
They've got to champion this
vision and make it happen.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.200
That's what the program
manager has got to do.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.780
So DARPA starts with division.

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:40.820
That is not how
industry operates.

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:44.968
That's not how other
government agencies operate.

00:07:49.570 --> 00:07:54.880
Industry works largely on what's
called a "stage gate system."

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.730
So industry is going
to want to do typically

00:07:57.730 --> 00:07:59.410
more incremental
kind of advances,

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:02.320
because the advances can snap
onto markets that it's already

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.560
got, and economic opportunities
that it already sees,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.710
and technologies that it's
already starting to explore.

00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:10.300
So it's typically
going to want to do

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.850
more incremental advances.

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:18.060
And it's only going to do those
incremental advances if they

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:21.070
can optimize them economically.

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.650
So an industry R&D
project has got

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:29.400
to go through a series of
stage gates, which essentially

00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.890
is a way of tearing down
a large menu of stuff

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:39.270
and getting to the most
economically optimal.

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.580
Industry stage gate process
is not a technology visioning

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.080
system.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.582
It's not deciding on
a vision and doing

00:08:48.582 --> 00:08:50.290
whatever is necessary
to get there, which

00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:52.000
is the way DARPA operates.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.240
It's a much more limited set
of procedural stage gates

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:57.670
that a technology idea
has got to go through.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:09:01.570
So DARPA just working
on a very different kind

00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:04.390
of organizational model from the
way in which things are done,

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:13.030
either at other agencies
or within industry.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:15.100
And starting with
this vision up front

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.850
is a really interesting
organizational idea,

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:22.270
that you all should kind
of keep in mind when you're

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:24.820
operating out there, and
setting up your own companies,

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:27.490
and doing your own startups.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:30.450
So Max, you've got
Tammy Carleton's piece.

00:09:30.450 --> 00:09:31.240
MAX: Right.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:36.622
The key step within
Carleton's five steps

00:09:36.622 --> 00:09:38.080
that I thought was
most interesting

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.060
was the fifth one,
technology transfer, which

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.200
is supposed to bridge the R&D--

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.680
the valley of death,
as it were, that

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.280
enables a different scientific
idea to be commercialized,

00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.220
and to actually affect people
all over the world, eventually.

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.980
While reading, I
kind of realized

00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:03.020
that DARPA seems like they have
a pretty decent organization.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:05.260
They get things done
relatively efficiently.

00:10:05.260 --> 00:10:07.220
They have a lot of money.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.970
Why is it they have--

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:11.230
and I actually just
decided to start googling,

00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:13.750
to try to figure out if DARPA
had done anything related

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:14.260
to fusion.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.090
And I couldn't find anything.

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:20.492
So I'm curious, why not?

00:10:20.492 --> 00:10:21.950
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Well, actually,

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.730
DARPA deferred on
energy technologies

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:28.030
to ARPA-E, when
ARPA-E got stood up,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:32.680
because DARPA views
ARPA-E as a compatriot.

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.860
And ARPA-E interestingly, has
done some extremely interesting

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:38.992
work on fusion.

00:10:38.992 --> 00:10:41.590
STUDENT: I know Lockheed
[INAUDIBLE] fusion--

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:42.673
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:10:42.673 --> 00:10:43.630
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.243
MAX: Yeah, but
Lockheed Martin's--

00:10:47.243 --> 00:10:49.410
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Well,
they have the Skunk Works.

00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:50.050
MAX: They do.

00:10:50.050 --> 00:10:52.675
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And DARPA's
done an enormous amount of work

00:10:52.675 --> 00:10:56.013
with the Skunk Works over
time, including stealth.

00:10:56.013 --> 00:10:58.180
MAX: Granted, yes-- they
definitely have a facility,

00:10:58.180 --> 00:11:00.880
and they definitely have
the project managers.

00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.620
I just feel that
it's a bit of an area

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.150
outside of their expertise.

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:06.657
They're going to accidentally
make it fly and stuff.

00:11:06.657 --> 00:11:07.740
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:09.790
And look-- another issue
for DARPA is-- remember,

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:11.582
these technologies have
got to get stood up

00:11:11.582 --> 00:11:14.213
in the lifetime of the project.

00:11:14.213 --> 00:11:15.130
MAX: Yeah, five years.

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:16.370
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Like
a five year project.

00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:18.040
So if you can't do
it within five years,

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.410
it's very hard to put
it on the DARPA agenda.

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:22.832
MAX: Well, you mentioned
that some of the projects

00:11:22.832 --> 00:11:24.790
would get handed off to
other project managers.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:25.120
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.630
MAX: So that's how long
a manager lasts, right?

00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:28.630
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:30.790
MAX: But it's not always
how long a project lasts.

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:31.790
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.690
Sometimes, there can be
intergenerational transfers.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:38.620
And then Licklider developed
a different kind of system.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:44.080
He created a community
that kept continuing

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.880
with the same kind
of ethos, working

00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.770
on that same set
of agenda items,

00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:50.200
working them down
one after another,

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.205
and making progress year
after year on each of them.

00:11:53.205 --> 00:11:54.580
So that's a
different kind of way

00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.080
that DARPA is going
to be organized.

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.530
But typically, once
the program manager

00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:03.250
leaves who had the
vision, their job

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:05.790
is to get that implemented
in their, in effect,

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.240
DARPA lifetime.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.150
And if they haven't,
then it's hard for DARPA

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.810
to continue that,
which we could view

00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.525
as a weakness of the program.

00:12:16.525 --> 00:12:18.650
On the other hand, you
could view it as a strength.

00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:20.817
MAX: Yeah, because then
they make sure that things--

00:12:20.817 --> 00:12:22.600
that if they are
working, then they keep--

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.250
they may proceed with
it, or they pass it off

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.090
to someone else.

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:26.090
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes.

00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:33.990
MAX: So speaking of Licklider,
actually, while I was reading,

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.980
I noticed that Licklider had
mentioned that he heavily

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.480
relied on standardized tests
when picking candidates,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:43.440
so like that recruitment
of great talent.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.300
Given that literally
everyone in this room

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.270
has experience with standardized
testing, and at least

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:51.840
I can't speak for everyone,
but I don't like it very much.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.550
I wonder--

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:53.842
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE] two tests.

00:12:53.842 --> 00:12:54.690
MAX: Which two?

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:55.350
It was ACTs.

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:56.490
STUDENT: One was
like a psych test,

00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.626
and the other one was
like a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:57.626 --> 00:12:58.320
STUDENT 1: GRE.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.742
We did the GRE, it said.

00:12:59.742 --> 00:13:01.200
STUDENT: Well,
there's another one,

00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.742
but it seemed like
a psychology test.

00:13:02.742 --> 00:13:04.013
I'm not sure.

00:13:04.013 --> 00:13:05.680
STUDENT 1: So I think
that she mentioned

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.800
that he was the only one who
asked for test scores at all.

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.997
And one was the GRE,
which is kind of weird.

00:13:12.997 --> 00:13:15.580
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Remember,
he was a psychologist coming out

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:16.930
of the testing world.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:21.060
So that's probably
part of the reason.

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.270
MAX: I'll chalk it up to
[INAUDIBLE],, because there's

00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:27.187
only so much a standardized
test can tell you.

00:13:27.187 --> 00:13:29.353
They won't really tell you
how you work with people.

00:13:29.353 --> 00:13:30.970
They won't tell you
anything about how

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.580
you work on anything that's
not related to, I don't know,

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:36.205
math or literature.

00:13:36.205 --> 00:13:38.830
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: He did come
up with a pretty talented team,

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:39.140
though.

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:40.098
MAX: Yeah, that's true.

00:13:40.098 --> 00:13:42.870
STUDENT: I mean, you get
pretty far on psychology tests,

00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:44.460
especially when it
comes to intertia.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:46.835
Because you have to figure
out, for really good visionary

00:13:46.835 --> 00:13:49.560
leaders, what
they'll figure out is

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:52.040
they're intellectuals,
introverts, extroverts,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.800
and they have a supporting
side to their psyche.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.560
And they're kind of like
the avatar of team groups.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.190
So it's pretty good for if you
want to find out good leaders.

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:04.964
And I know it's been pretty
effective in manageent theory

00:14:04.964 --> 00:14:06.862
when you use psych tests.

00:14:06.862 --> 00:14:08.320
It's also really
good to figure out

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.535
who is going to be a
really good scientist,

00:14:10.535 --> 00:14:12.160
because it's usually
highly introverted

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:16.120
and comes up with new insights
that doesn't follow the crowd.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.830
So I can see why
that's important.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.840
The GRE might be, but
also, if your score is low,

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:22.967
but if you've come out
with a good body of work,

00:14:22.967 --> 00:14:24.550
then they can probably
assume that you

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:26.383
are pretty smart, even
if you didn't do well

00:14:26.383 --> 00:14:27.331
on standardized tests.

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:31.860
STUDENT 2: Because I'm
looking up her LinkedIn.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.080
And it says that she has-- her
background is in communication.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.080
And then she got a Master's
in Public Relations.

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.625
And then she did a PhD in
Mechanical Engineering Design.

00:14:39.625 --> 00:14:42.000
But that must have been back
in the day when the D School

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.090
at Stanford accepted
non-engineers

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.820
and non-scientists,
because now they don't.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:51.840
So it would be curious to
think about the ways in which

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.750
her background, in particular,
might give her that insight

00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:57.870
that an engineer might not have
about this particular field,

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.080
going back to the question of
multidisciplinary great groups.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.070
But I don't know to what
extent, for example,

00:15:03.070 --> 00:15:05.840
someone like me might be
accepted in maybe Lilly's lab.

00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.250
LILLY: One of the most
famous women in my field

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:13.500
has an undergraduate
degree in German.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:14.840
So you never know.

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:19.340
STUDENT: Lloyd Blankfein, the
CEO of J P Morgan, I think--

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:20.490
his degree's in history.

00:15:20.490 --> 00:15:21.975
And he almost
barely didn't pass.

00:15:21.975 --> 00:15:23.350
He said he still
gets nightmares,

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:26.965
because he didn't fulfill
all the requirements.

00:15:26.965 --> 00:15:28.590
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
All right, so we're

00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:31.410
going to move out of the testing
world back to the DARPA world.

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.870
MAX: Sure.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.420
So one of the things
that Carleton pointed out

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:42.510
was that as DARPA has aged, so,
too, have its project managers.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:46.710
Even though they cycle between
new managers every four or five

00:15:46.710 --> 00:15:50.820
years, the average age of the
managers that they would pick

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.610
was going up steadily.

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.200
So I'm curious if
anyone has thoughts

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.230
on what the effect of that would
be on their managerial ability,

00:15:58.230 --> 00:16:02.280
or on DARPA's
direction as a whole.

00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.030
STUDENT: Could you
repeat that first part?

00:16:04.030 --> 00:16:04.530
MAX: Yeah.

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:07.080
So the average age of
the project managers

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:08.807
has been increasing,
as DARPA has--

00:16:08.807 --> 00:16:10.140
STUDENT: What's the average age?

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:11.557
MAX: I don't
remember the numbers.

00:16:11.557 --> 00:16:12.680
STUDENT: Is it 27?

00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.240
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: No,
it's a lot older than that.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.323
STUDENT: It's a lot older?

00:16:15.323 --> 00:16:16.820
MAX: Yeah.

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:20.180
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: One
of the reasons, Max,

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:22.760
may be that it's--

00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:31.070
I mean, watching MIT, it's
very hard for younger faculty

00:16:31.070 --> 00:16:34.460
to walk out of the place
before they get tenure.

00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:37.430
It's hard enough to walk
out once you get tenure,

00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:41.330
but it's impossible to walk
out before you get tenure.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.710
And because you're
establishing a whole--

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.730
your research portfolio and
your whole researching system,

00:16:46.730 --> 00:16:49.080
and it's very hard
to walk out of that.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:52.835
In addition, when you go to
DARPA, you've got a conflict.

00:16:52.835 --> 00:16:54.710
Once you've worked there,
you have a conflict

00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:55.970
of interest with DARPA.

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.428
You're not going
to be able to deal

00:16:57.428 --> 00:17:00.270
with the agency for a
certain period of time.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:02.478
So if they happen to be
funding your research before,

00:17:02.478 --> 00:17:05.062
they're not going to be able to
continue funding your research

00:17:05.062 --> 00:17:06.480
once you've worked there.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.480
So it's gotten more
complicated for DARPA

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:10.760
to recruit at the
university level.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.210
It's gotten a lot
more difficult.

00:17:12.210 --> 00:17:14.660
So the route between
MIT and DARPA,

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.480
frankly, used to be a
lot easier to manage.

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:23.460
And when I look at my colleagues
here who have gone to DARPA,

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.988
they are more typically
fairly far along,

00:17:25.988 --> 00:17:28.280
and very assured about their
career, and their research

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.530
foundation, and their writing.

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:31.340
They've done that
stuff, and they

00:17:31.340 --> 00:17:33.890
can take a three
or five year break,

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.830
and get that really
big, visionary thing

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:39.800
that they've wanted to
work on forever done

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.730
when they go to DARPA.

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:42.730
But it's harder when
you're trying to administer

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.930
a whole research portfolio.

00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:47.230
Again, with the IPA
authority, you've

00:17:47.230 --> 00:17:49.760
got a certain freedom to come
back to your organization

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.530
and keep the
day-to-day stuff going.

00:17:51.530 --> 00:17:53.240
But it's still not simple.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:57.140
So that may be one
part of the reason

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:00.170
that you tend to get somewhat
older faculty than they

00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.832
probably used to
at the beginning.

00:18:01.832 --> 00:18:03.838
STUDENT 1: Licklider
wasn't especially young

00:18:03.838 --> 00:18:04.880
when he was the director.

00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.710
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Right, he wasn't young.

00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:08.380
STUDENT 1: Or the
project manager.

00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:11.940
So I think age does affect the
perspective that you bring in.

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:15.710
But having older people
isn't a bad thing.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:17.610
I think in the tech
world, it's seen

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.590
as like if you're
not young and hip,

00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:23.440
you're going to be out of touch
with what's going to work.

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:24.770
But I don't know if that's a--

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.240
I think the points
that Bill made

00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:28.598
about having to kind of
establish yourself and figure

00:18:28.598 --> 00:18:30.890
out what your vision is, you
have more time when you're

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:33.730
older to have a vision.

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:35.470
LILLY: Yeah, and
perspective as well.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:38.620
Just thinking about advisors
I've had over the years,

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.800
and younger or newer
advisors versus more

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.570
established advisors--
they definitely

00:18:43.570 --> 00:18:47.810
have a different perspective.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:53.290
And yeah, NASA is actually
having the same phenomenon,

00:18:53.290 --> 00:18:57.690
with having directors who are
progressively older and older.

00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:00.360
So that's very
sim-- they can't--

00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.940
it's very difficult
to draw someone away

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.210
from a mid-range career if
they're being very successful,

00:19:06.210 --> 00:19:07.780
and having success
getting grants.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:12.470
And it's hard to get them into
administration or directorships

00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:13.053
or management.

00:19:13.053 --> 00:19:14.470
STUDENT: What would
the difference

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:16.125
between young and
older directors be?

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:25.170
LILLY: In general, actually,
the more established and older

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:28.710
advisors that I've had
have had a lot more

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:35.409
perspicacity with respect to
what projects are worthwhile,

00:19:35.409 --> 00:19:39.467
actually, or--

00:19:39.467 --> 00:19:41.300
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Through long experience,

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:44.780
you're suggesting, because
they've seen a lot.

00:19:44.902 --> 00:19:46.610
LILLY: Yeah, that's
the impression I get.

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:47.693
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:19:49.630 --> 00:19:51.010
Next, how about
another question?

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:51.728
MAX: Sure.

00:19:51.728 --> 00:19:52.664
All right.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.750
So Carleton
mentioned that DARPA,

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:05.222
in order to save time
when they are trying

00:20:05.222 --> 00:20:06.680
to develop these
projects, they try

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.040
to discourage consensus, which
I didn't really see as a--

00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:13.050
I think it was the second,
the next slide you have.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:13.550
Yeah.

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:17.362
So I understand
why, because then it

00:20:17.362 --> 00:20:19.320
ensures that whatever
you're trying to develop,

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.630
it gets done quickly.

00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:22.370
But just because it
gets done quickly

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:24.410
doesn't really mean
that it gets done right.

00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:28.820
So I guess I was curious
what people thought on that,

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:31.028
specifically that decision.

00:20:31.028 --> 00:20:33.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It's a
very interesting point, Max.

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.750
And actually, ARPA-E--
and we'll talk about it

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:38.770
when we get to ARPA-E
and the energy class,

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:42.390
but ARPA-E does have a process.

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.010
It's a much smaller agency, so
it's 300 million, not 3 billion

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:47.120
like DARPA.

00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:52.370
So it's like a big DARPA
office, sizable DARPA office,

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:54.290
one of its five or six offices.

00:20:54.290 --> 00:20:58.280
So ARPA-E does have
a consensus process.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.730
They bring in-- they call
them "project directors"

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:03.830
but they're program managers.

00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:05.660
And that community,
really, you have

00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.900
to present your vision
to that community.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.890
And that's a very tough-minded
group, and a very sophisticated

00:21:12.890 --> 00:21:13.700
group.

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:17.150
And the director is quite
sophisticated at ARPA-E

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.530
historically, as well.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:20.900
So they did a variation on this.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.680
At DARPA, it's much more,
convince your office director,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.950
and then the office
director will work with you

00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:29.660
on convincing the
director of DARPA.

00:21:29.660 --> 00:21:32.330
It's a simpler, more
straightforward process.

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:33.980
You do get support
from other program

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.870
managers, who will have a lot
of advice and ideas for you.

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:39.813
So it's a pretty
supportive operation.

00:21:39.813 --> 00:21:41.480
Nobody's in competition
with each other.

00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.855
They're there to
help each other,

00:21:42.855 --> 00:21:46.970
so that's a positive,
although again, they're

00:21:46.970 --> 00:21:48.530
competing to achieve
their vision.

00:21:48.530 --> 00:21:49.905
And everybody kind
of knows who's

00:21:49.905 --> 00:21:52.362
getting their vision
done, and kind of who is

00:21:52.362 --> 00:21:53.570
in trouble with their vision.

00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:55.640
So that's kind of
known and understood.

00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:58.070
There's a certain kind of
competition in that way,

00:21:58.070 --> 00:22:01.860
but it's not a direct one-on-one
competition with each other.

00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:05.030
But at ARPA-E, there is more
of a consensus decision making.

00:22:05.030 --> 00:22:10.970
And Luyao when she was
telling us about Xerox PARC,

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:15.140
remember, your whole discussion
about the dealer process

00:22:15.140 --> 00:22:18.440
and having to bring your idea
to the whole team sitting around

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.050
on beanbags, who
would tear it apart--

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:24.590
that's kind of a
consensus process.

00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:27.740
It's a definite,
tough-minded review process

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.087
that DARPA doesn't
really quite have.

00:22:30.087 --> 00:22:32.420
So there may be strengths and
weaknesses in both models.

00:22:37.668 --> 00:22:38.960
Max, what do you think on that?

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.990
MAX: Yeah, I could see there'd
be strengths and weaknesses

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:45.490
to both.

00:22:45.490 --> 00:22:54.083
But it just feels if you have
less consensus, than you have--

00:22:54.083 --> 00:22:55.750
if you have fewer
people that are trying

00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:57.640
to discuss these
ideas, then there

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.960
might be some critical
flaw that you might not--

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.502
that you might just miss, just
because there are fewer people

00:23:02.502 --> 00:23:06.670
with more diverse experiences.

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:10.240
Of course, if you have a decent
idea of the science behind it,

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.220
and it's not
something as untested

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:15.370
as fusion, for
example, then I could

00:23:15.370 --> 00:23:17.210
see it working pretty well.

00:23:17.210 --> 00:23:20.980
I mean, if you had
to do that for--

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:24.220
I could see it having problems
with something untested

00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:25.630
like stealth.

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:27.640
But apparently,
they made it work.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:34.888
So maybe they're
passing my expectations.

00:23:34.888 --> 00:23:38.890
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
Silicon Valley perspective,

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:42.520
like it's a pretty
common mantra to say

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.980
you want to have an idea
that people kind of say

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:46.690
is not a good idea.

00:23:46.690 --> 00:23:48.550
Because the idea is,
if you're coming up

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:49.900
with something that's
pretty innovative,

00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.220
most likely people
won't agree with it,

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.900
or it doesn't make sense,
or you have an insight

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.245
that other people don't get.

00:23:54.245 --> 00:23:55.870
Also, if you're an
expert, you probably

00:23:55.870 --> 00:23:58.020
know some things that
other people don't know,

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:00.687
that you'd have to bring them up
to speed on, especially if it's

00:24:00.687 --> 00:24:02.520
in a completely new area.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.582
And so the history
has been, they're

00:24:05.582 --> 00:24:08.825
just saying that for new
fields, who is the expert?

00:24:08.825 --> 00:24:10.450
It wouldn't be a PhD,
because the field

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:11.880
hasn't been invented yet.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:15.360
It's this person who just
started working on it.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:20.100
So Bill Gates was an expert on
software for personal computers

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:21.860
before that even became a thing.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.400
So it's very common
to-- consensus

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:26.940
is actually really bad, because
you put down these ideas based

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:27.730
on new insights.

00:24:27.730 --> 00:24:28.230
So.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:30.240
LILLY: Yeah, and another
issue with consensus

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:32.670
is you have to
assume, or you have

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:37.800
to have a group in which all
members have the personality

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:43.380
type that they will concede
to someone else's idea

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.620
to get consensus,
even if it's not

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:47.415
their pet project
or their favorite.

00:24:47.415 --> 00:24:48.290
You know what I mean?

00:24:48.290 --> 00:24:50.978
Some people aren't disposed
to do that, no matter what.

00:24:53.935 --> 00:24:56.310
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: About a
closing thought on this, Max?

00:24:56.310 --> 00:24:57.460
MAX: Sure.

00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:01.600
So overall, I feel
that DARPA seems

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:03.890
to have been a
pretty great success.

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:06.070
They've made lots of
really cool projects.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:08.170
They do it very quickly.

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.550
Not sure how cheaply they
do it, but they get it done.

00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:14.500
And because of that
continued success,

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:18.580
I feel that that's
probably why they continue

00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:21.250
to get so much funding.

00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:25.840
I really try to emphasize that
technology transfer aspect,

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.740
because it ensures that the
technology that they develop

00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.190
isn't just it's a nice, new
toy for the military to have.

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:35.830
It ensures that whatever
they make, from the internet,

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:38.990
GPS, et cetera, that
everyone can use it,

00:25:38.990 --> 00:25:42.310
and that it makes our
entire society better.

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:48.890
So I guess that's pretty
much just why I like DARPA.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:50.150
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Great.

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:53.500
There's a lot of MIT folks and
people saying, what do you do?

00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:58.180
All right, let me do a quick
wrap up of today's class.

00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:01.990
So we did Mitch Waldrop's book.

00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:04.210
And I really wanted
to kind of portray

00:26:04.210 --> 00:26:07.500
the governmental role in
supporting the earlier stage

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.820
of the evolution of computing.

00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:13.420
It was a proving ground
for new concepts,

00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:17.200
and designs, and architectures.

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.270
The Defense Department
created an initial market

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:21.440
for a lot of the new
products, and services,

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:24.070
and in fact, whole industries.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.580
This greatly expanded university
research capabilities,

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:31.190
the computing revolution.

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:36.920
And it was done to further
governmental missions.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:40.950
But it had, obviously,
dramatic societal effects.

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:43.910
So it featured
governmental agencies

00:26:43.910 --> 00:26:45.800
playing a pretty central role.

00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:47.670
DARPA, as we discussed
was critical,

00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:51.230
but some of the others
were necessary and needed.

00:26:51.230 --> 00:26:53.300
And the governmental
agency sponsored

00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:56.990
these industry-university
collaborations

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.050
that led to great strength
in the university side,

00:27:00.050 --> 00:27:02.330
and focus areas around them.

00:27:02.330 --> 00:27:07.990
So in the reading that
we did from the textbook,

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:09.740
the central point
here was that DARPA

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:14.600
was uniquely able to combine an
innovation institutional role,

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.150
as well as a great
groups innovation

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:21.470
at the face-to-face
level kind of role.

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:22.940
That's a remarkable
accomplishment.

00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:28.370
And then DARPA's ability, as
we talked about in that reading

00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:34.070
as well, to innovate
in a legacy sector,

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:37.610
to do a frontier sector
like IT, but also

00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:41.060
innovate within a legacy sector,
and do things like stealth,

00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:42.560
and UAVs--

00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.670
that's a pretty
fascinating organization,

00:27:46.670 --> 00:27:48.920
that's flexible,
and interesting,

00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.140
and able to do great stuff.

00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:53.450
Glenn Fong's piece
was really about DARPA

00:27:53.450 --> 00:27:55.820
playing the central
institutional mobilization

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:58.340
role for the IT revolution.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:01.160
And Tammy Carleton's
piece really

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:04.070
told us about this kind
of central importance

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:09.980
of technology visioning as a
key modus operandi, that DARPA

00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:11.712
been able to operate in.

00:28:11.712 --> 00:28:14.762
Any closing questions?

00:28:14.762 --> 00:28:16.220
Good luck with your
paper outlines.

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.170
Let me know if you
have questions.

00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.950
And I look forward to
seeing you on Tuesday.

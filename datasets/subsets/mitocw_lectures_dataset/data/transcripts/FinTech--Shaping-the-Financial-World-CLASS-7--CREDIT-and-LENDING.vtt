00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.982
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:03.973
[RUSTLING]

00:00:04.473 --> 00:00:05.964
[CLICKING]

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.620
GARY GENSLER: So welcome back.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.880
We're going to keep this
journey going on FinTech.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.480
We spoke about payments
in our last class.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.320
And here in Class 7, we're
going to dive into credit,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.310
and there's a lot to cover.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.910
There are so many different
segments and sectors

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.940
in the credit space, and
there's a lot going on

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.280
with financial technology,
not just because

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.720
of artificial intelligence,
Open API, but even

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.510
the earlier things that
were brought into the tech.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.730
Now, technology stack around
mobile phones and the like

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.810
still gives a lot of
opportunity to break in here,

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.660
and the use of alternative data.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.790
So I'm going to bring up--

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:09.260
share some slides
and get going here.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.890
First, I should
also say to those

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.100
who celebrate such things,
happy Earth Day, April 22.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.350
It's also my daughter's
birthday, my eldest,

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.140
my first daughter at 3.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.580
So today's a special day, Earth
Day and my daughter's birthday.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.320
So happy birthday, Anna.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.780
So I'm going to do a
little update on Facebook.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.520
We spoke about Facebook in
our last class about payments.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.950
And there were interesting
announcements, actually,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.740
as we were together.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.350
Facebook was announcing
some updates.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.740
And then dive into
the credit world.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.210
And before we dive
into FinTech, just

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.120
talk a little bit about
those credit sectors

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.830
and the market designing credit.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.650
And that provides,
as we'll see, some

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:13.520
of the disruptive potential
and how disruptive Taq

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.440
can break into the
credit value chain.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.470
What you're always
looking for in a business,

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.260
whether it's about
FinTech or otherwise,

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.100
is somehow to break into
another party's value chain

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.280
or to create value
for customers.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.370
Either you can create value
where others haven't seen it,

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.990
or you want to break into
somebody else's value chain.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.840
So we'll talk a
little bit about that,

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.610
how we see that pretty
early in this area

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.100
of financial technology.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.220
And then a review of the
competitive landscape

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.776
by the different marketplaces.

00:02:49.776 --> 00:02:55.280
I'll touch on marketplace
lending and credit scoring,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.310
and then I'll close with just
a comment on professionalism

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.040
and academic
integrity, as people

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.240
are gearing up for their papers
and group work, and so forth,

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.740
again.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.040
The readings included a review
of 12 FinTech companies.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.480
This was just a taste test.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.850
It was one article in
reaction to Apple Credit Card.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.450
And these were FinTech companies
in the credit card space.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.130
But as we'll see
today, we're going

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.590
to review a lot of the
other spaces, as well.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.320
A brief article
that I thought was

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.420
helpful about how
tech companies are

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.930
seeing how to get into the
lending business, big tech,

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.100
particularly.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.920
Marketplace lenders,
we'll look at Lending Club

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:41.360
more particularly, and
then alternative data.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.910
Study questions, again,
are not just for you

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.340
to gear up and
prepare for the class,

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.570
but this is where I
want to sort of end how

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.620
we can think about this, really
importantly, how big tech

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.630
firms are positioning
themselves to offer credit.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.180
And I don't know,
Romain, if anybody

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.300
is going to sort of get
the cobwebs off and give us

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.407
some thoughts, but
I'm going to turn

00:04:05.407 --> 00:04:07.990
it to Romain to see if there's
anybody that wants to just give

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.350
it a thought, broad overview
of big tech in this space,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.600
whether it's from China,
Europe, the US, Latin America.

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.880
OK, let's go for today's class.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.910
Who would like to be
the first volunteer?

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:23.790
Michael.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:24.290
Thank you.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.290
AUDIENCE: I guess
something from the article

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.050
that [INAUDIBLE] just kind of
seeing over the last decade,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.100
what's going on, there's
been a lot more availability

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.820
of lending.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.082
I think Lending Club was--

00:04:41.082 --> 00:04:44.150
I kind of saw it more
from a personal investing

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.580
point of view, but kind of
thinking of who can actually

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.080
have access to credit has
been a huge position of tech

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:56.450
in the US, and also the speed
of the traditional credit

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.490
process for consumers
and small businesses

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.830
has been kind of painful.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.230
So that's definitely a
big area that big tech

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:10.155
is trying to tackle with AI
and just automated processes.

00:05:10.155 --> 00:05:11.280
GARY GENSLER: Right, right.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.470
But Michael, if you add to it,
think about big tech companies.

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.770
How are big tech companies
strategically positioning

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:19.630
themselves?

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.010
I mean, Lending Club and
the marketplace lenders

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.000
are a very important
trend here, as well,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
these sort of more
disruptive companies,

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.890
some of them becoming
incumbents in their space.

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:34.360
But how about big platforms?

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.580
I guess embedding it with their
current services, products

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:38.570
that they already have.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:39.920
Like, Apple Pay
was a good example,

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.420
where it's just
kind of everybody's

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.180
already using an iPhone, so if
they can just make it seamless

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.490
with their existing processes.

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.470
So this is again
[INAUDIBLE]---- well,

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.720
I see a couple other hands up.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.420
So, Romain?

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.975
TA: Alessandro?

00:05:54.975 --> 00:05:55.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:00.710
I think, also, Amazon is a
very interesting case where,

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.350
thanks to all the data, they
have gathered on sellers

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.560
from their marketplace,
they are able to offer

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.590
short-term lending to all the
sellers on the marketplace.

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.570
And this also gives them
a competitive advantage.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:17.760
These would be banks,
commercial banks, first of all.

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.700
Because the notion of this
lending is very small.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.020
So it's comparable
to microlending.

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.910
And second, because
they have access

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.950
to a huge amount of data on
the business of these sellers.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:37.650
And third, they have a
direct accessed repayment.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:40.140
Because basically,
these repayments

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:44.810
are automatic from the business
of the sellers on the Amazon

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:46.367
Marketplace.

00:06:46.367 --> 00:06:47.200
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:54.580
So what Michael and
Alexandro have said is--

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.320
well, first, we talked a little
bit about the disruptors.

00:06:57.320 --> 00:06:59.960
But in terms of
big tech, they have

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.110
a lot of network advantages,
whether it's Apple.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:04.610
And there's so many
people that have

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.070
their phones and their
products, whether it's

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:08.780
Amazon in the case that--

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.030
Alexandro, we can go to
other countries as well.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:14.670
This is certainly true in a
very significant way in China.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.050
But if it's not just
isolated in China and the US

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.060
is that they have big
networks of users.

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.310
They collect data
and particularly

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.780
if you're a marketplace
like Amazon or Alibaba.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.270
When you're selling
product, you're

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:34.070
seeing both sides of a market.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.580
You're seeing the consumer
side, the hundreds of millions

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.470
of people in China or
the tens of millions

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:40.730
of people in the US.

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.100
But you're seeing
the merchant side.

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:46.190
And so that data, and that
flow, and that activity

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:50.030
gives you a natural
competitive edge.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.370
And then lastly, what
was just mentioned

00:07:52.370 --> 00:07:55.250
is automatic
payment, particularly

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.450
if you're in an online
platform selling something.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.060
You see that merchant's
payment stream,

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.130
but also, you lower
the credit risk.

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:06.050
Because consumers are buying.

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.500
You take your piece to pay
back, whether it's a revolving

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.340
or term loan to a merchant.

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.980
So a lot of competitive
edges or even advantages

00:08:15.980 --> 00:08:19.700
in this space for
them to build upon

00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:22.945
to provide a credit product.

00:08:22.945 --> 00:08:24.820
TA: Sijin would also
like to share a thought.

00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:26.750
GARY GENSLER: Yeah, please.

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.880
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
the case of Alibaba

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.020
is really interesting.

00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:33.200
Because just like
Gary had mentioned,

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.820
there are a lot of
transaction data

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.880
and also use their
data in Alibaba.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.559
So right now, Alibaba not
only offer the payment system,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:44.600
it also offer a credit system.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.610
You can borrow
money from Alibaba.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:50.010
Actually, it has its own
credit system that can--

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:51.420
I mean, the credit rating.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.330
They can determine
how much money

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:55.100
you can borrow from Alibaba.

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.700
So I think this case
is fairly interesting.

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.150
GARY GENSLER:
Yeah, so two things

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:04.340
that I think I want to tease out
of that is the idea of building

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:06.320
credit on top of payments.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.480
Now, this is not
a new phenomena.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:12.620
This goes back centuries
that any good banker

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.810
knew that if you were in
the center of payments,

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.220
you had more information.

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:21.110
You had more data, even
in a pre-computer age.

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.230
But what we find is a lot
of the big tech companies

00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:29.030
as well as the disruptors chose
to get into the payment space

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.240
and then build upon that credit.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.090
Now, as it relates
to Alibaba, what

00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:38.030
better way to do that
than to provide a payment

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:41.750
mechanism to purchase the
products on your platform,

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:43.310
similar with Amazon?

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:45.200
And then you can build
credit upon that.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.930
Because you've got an
incredible amount of data.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.970
But also, you can
provide credit in what's

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:53.360
called point-of-sale credit.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:57.620
Buy something, pay for it over
6 weeks, 8 weeks, 10 weeks

00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.970
when you're purchasing,
so good points.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.760
So what is marketplace
lending, this phenomena

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.512
that started out at
the United Kingdom?

00:10:08.512 --> 00:10:10.220
We'll talk a little
bit about LendingClub

00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:16.710
here in the US, started about
a dozen to 15 years ago.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:18.530
What is it in its theory?

00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:21.590
And where is it right now?

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.760
Anybody want to chat
about that for a minute?

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:29.330
LendingClub, LendingTree--
a lot of companies

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:30.670
that we can chat about here.

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:31.170
TA: Alida?

00:10:34.818 --> 00:10:37.130
AUDIENCE: Yes, the
marketplace [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:41.310
lending instead of the concept
of allowing individuals

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.640
to lend to other
individuals or companies

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.410
through a marketplace.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:49.800
And while they've been
around for a while,

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:54.030
they've really just come
into lending platforms.

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:58.110
And they're really supported
by a securitization market

00:10:58.110 --> 00:11:01.830
behind them now, rather
than individuals lending

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:03.997
on the platform
for the most part.

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:04.830
GARY GENSLER: Right.

00:11:04.830 --> 00:11:05.330
Right.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.770
And Michael spoke about
this earlier as well.

00:11:07.770 --> 00:11:09.610
I think it's an
interesting concept,

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:14.010
but that it hasn't actually
lived up to its early promise.

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:20.700
The promise, when this
came about in 2005 to 2007,

00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.330
was that you and I could use
the internet to communicate.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:27.510
And I could lend to you, and
you could borrow from me,

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:33.180
peer to peer, without
a central intermediary.

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.760
Now, there was always going
to be some intermediary.

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:42.000
Because there was a platform, a
software provider taking a fee,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.200
but somehow matching
lenders to borrowers

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.320
in a peer-to-peer network.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.800
What we found over
these 13 or 15 years

00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:57.570
is that the marketplace
lenders like LendingClub

00:11:57.570 --> 00:12:01.050
have shifted to
securitization market

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.490
to raise their money, a
highly organized and somewhat

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:08.730
centralized market
securitization market.

00:12:08.730 --> 00:12:12.390
And on the lending side,
you're still very much saying

00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:14.620
that you're going
through a portal

00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.830
and that there's only so
many of these portals.

00:12:16.830 --> 00:12:20.790
So it's not that it's
truly peer to peer.

00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:24.090
And in fact, often it's now
called marketplace lending

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:26.790
in its platforms.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:30.540
I think that it's still
a very important part

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.420
of the disruptive
credit landscape,

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:36.320
but it's a small percentage
of that marketplace.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.120
And it's shifting very
dramatically from peer

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.330
to peer to online portals.

00:12:42.330 --> 00:12:47.130
It's still access centralized
credit in many ways.

00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:47.820
And we'll see.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.278
And we'll chat a
little bit about--

00:12:49.278 --> 00:12:51.150
LendingClub is even now buying--

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:55.140
announced earlier in
2020 to buy a bank

00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:57.735
and merged with the bank itself.

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.740
And then there's already
been some discussion

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:06.710
of alternative data,
but alternative data

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.810
building upon a history
in many countries

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:16.510
for four or five decades to use
data to make credit decisions

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:17.410
by changing it.

00:13:17.410 --> 00:13:21.070
And I see a hand raised
on this, maybe, Romain?

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.480
Or no?

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.920
TA: I don't see
any hands raised.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:25.210
I'm sure one will come up.

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.250
GARY GENSLER: Going down.

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:29.560
So where does that take us?

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.780
Let me go back to Facebook
Libra just for a moment.

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.560
And this is where we
closed our last class is

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.250
that Facebook Libra had
announced in June of 2019.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:42.550
And then the People's
Bank of China

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:45.550
had already been working on
the digital currency project.

00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:49.633
But then they sped that
up a bit and announced

00:13:49.633 --> 00:13:52.050
within a month or two that
they were going to move forward

00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.060
with their currency project.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.510
Libra had announced
a token pegged

00:13:57.510 --> 00:13:59.670
to four or five
other currencies,

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.180
so is a multi-currency basket.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.730
And there was a lot of
push-back from central banks

00:14:05.730 --> 00:14:08.340
around the globe on
this concept that they

00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:10.320
would create what
Facebook actually

00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:15.000
announced-- a global currency
for billions of people.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.530
There was concern amongst
the G7 and G20 countries,

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:23.250
but there was also concern of
a broader group of countries

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:25.980
developing countries as
well as to what this meant

00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:31.140
for their monetary policy, how
stable this would really be,

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.620
and whether it would
compete with fiat currencies

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:37.208
in not just a positive way,
but maybe a negative way.

00:14:37.208 --> 00:14:39.000
And there were also a
lot of concerns about

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.830
whether it would support
and somehow become

00:14:43.830 --> 00:14:46.110
the domain of illicit activity--

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.560
drug runners, and the
like, and so forth.

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:53.660
So Facebook is a big company.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:55.373
They stub their toes
from time to time.

00:14:55.373 --> 00:14:57.040
This might have been
one of those times,

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.540
but it was an
innovative project.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:01.210
So they announced last
week some changes.

00:15:01.210 --> 00:15:04.100
And most importantly
for this conversation--

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.180
and this is just a
slide taken from--

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.190
I think it was a
Medium post I found.

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:13.780
They said that Libra
would now be a platform.

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:17.190
And they would do
single currency tokens--

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:21.700
a euro token, a US dollar token,
a sterling token, et cetera,

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:22.420
et cetera.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.430
They'll still have
a multi-basket,

00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.820
a multi-currency basket
coin called Libra.

00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.120
But they'll have what's, in
essence, stable value tokens.

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:35.150
And they feel that there's
still enough opportunity

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.800
or as what we talked about--
pain points in the payment

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.820
system that a dollar token, a
euro token, a British sterling

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:48.600
token, and the like is relevant
and an important layer.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.970
What Libra also
announced is that they're

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:56.380
taking a tiered approach
to this whole topic

00:15:56.380 --> 00:16:00.130
of anti-money laundering
and know your customer.

00:16:00.130 --> 00:16:03.550
In essence, working with
governments around the globe,

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:09.220
they're saying they would only
work with wallet providers.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.990
This would be single
currency wallet

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:15.010
providers or multi-currency
Libra wallet providers.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.840
They'd only work with a
digital wallet provider

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.010
if it was in a jurisdiction
that had regulation

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:26.370
and those wallets
and exchanges, if it

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.340
was on a crypto exchange
were well regulated

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.610
within those countries or at
least regulated and registered

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.750
within those countries under
the guidance around the globe

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.060
that's issued by the FATF.

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:42.600
The Financial Action
Task Force is anti-money

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.833
laundering standard
setters around the globe.

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.250
And they had said
that they wanted

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:49.410
to take a tiered
approach that would even

00:16:49.410 --> 00:16:53.970
include on the permissioned
blockchain in the protocol

00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:57.150
layer, in the software
itself some protections

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.170
against sanctions.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:16:59.628
Now, they didn't
say whether it was

00:16:59.628 --> 00:17:03.700
sanctions that were UN
sanctions, European sanctions,

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:04.619
US sanctions.

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:07.349
And then you get into some
interesting geopolitical issues

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:10.619
as to how Libra,
the associations

00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:12.240
would sort through this.

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.530
But it's interesting.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.839
Facebook is not giving
up, just because there's

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.460
a lot of push-back.

00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:19.920
And for those of you that
might watch this online

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:22.670
and might watch it
in 2021 or 2022--

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:27.660
but this course will have a life
for a while, offered online.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.090
It'll be interesting
to look back

00:17:29.090 --> 00:17:33.300
to see what other adjustments
at Facebook and Libra,

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.650
done in '20 and
2021, to continue

00:17:37.650 --> 00:17:46.650
to meet the official sector and
bring this thing to life going

00:17:46.650 --> 00:17:47.400
forward.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.890
Any questions on Libra?

00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:51.060
I had the opportunity.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:54.240
They actually reached out to
me last week after our class.

00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:57.150
And they wanted to give you a
little briefing to your faculty

00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:58.640
member on this.

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:05.145
TA: I don't see any
hands raised, Gary.

00:18:05.145 --> 00:18:06.145
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:18:06.145 --> 00:18:08.840
So I'm going to
sneak into credit.

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:10.148
So what are the credit sectors?

00:18:10.148 --> 00:18:11.190
I mean, we all know them.

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:15.820
This is pretty straightforward--
household sector

00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.340
and corporate sector.

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.630
But the household
sector-- the big pieces.

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:22.400
And those of you that
took the half semester

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.210
of consumer finance
course remember all this--

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.930
mortgages, autos, credit cards,
personal loans, student loans.

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.060
And then you can
have sub-sectors.

00:18:31.060 --> 00:18:33.340
If you're thinking about
disrupting this space,

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:36.040
you would think, all right,
where am I going to slice into?

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:38.670
Am I going to try to do
something in mortgages,

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:40.750
or credit cards, or where?

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:45.130
Am I going to try to go to
the high end, the low credit

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.110
risk super prime?

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:50.730
Or am I going to try to be
in the sub-prime marketplace?

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.520
And these markets are vast.

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.410
They're vast in
nearly every country.

00:18:56.410 --> 00:19:00.490
So you'd pick and target what
you're actually going for

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:04.030
and literally whether you're
picking debt consolidation

00:19:04.030 --> 00:19:08.140
or point-of-sale
lending matters as well.

00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:10.180
The corporate sector
is interesting.

00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:13.870
In terms of fintech,
the corporate sector

00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:18.160
has been disrupted
dramatically in earlier decades

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.770
by the securitization markets.

00:19:20.770 --> 00:19:24.100
And asset securitizations
happen primarily

00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:26.500
around the household sector.

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:28.990
But asset
securitization or a way

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:33.580
to fund lending through
the securities markets

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:37.090
has come to the real
estate and more recently

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:41.560
to the collateralized loan
markets or CLO markets.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.570
But in fact, when
we really think

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.970
about these markets,
what's been focused

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.090
on in terms of
financial disruption

00:19:49.090 --> 00:19:51.550
is primarily the
household sector.

00:19:51.550 --> 00:19:54.490
And then I circled
the small business

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:56.650
and small and
medium-sized enterprise.

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.110
Now, SME, mid-market
companies could

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.640
be defined all sorts of ways.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:03.550
In the middle of this
corona crisis in the US,

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.740
we seem to have latched
on to companies that

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:08.560
are less than 500 employees.

00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:12.790
It's not a specific definition
somewhere around the globe.

00:20:12.790 --> 00:20:18.500
But large enterprises can
access the securities markets

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:19.000
directly.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.730
Large enterprises
are, by and large,

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:25.210
borrowing from big banks
or securities markets.

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:27.580
And the greatest
opportunities have really

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.710
been in the small business
or SME market place.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.830
And it could be products
like cash advance products,

00:20:35.830 --> 00:20:38.380
purchased credit,
working capital lines.

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:40.270
We'll get a little
bit into this.

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:42.970
But again, if you're
thinking about credit,

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:44.410
it's a vast market.

00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:48.700
And it's not one to just forget
about all the little pieces

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:49.810
in there.

00:20:49.810 --> 00:20:52.040
Romain, I think there
were some questions.

00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:52.730
Sure.

00:20:52.730 --> 00:20:54.400
TA: Yes, we have a
question from Victor.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.320
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
see the point

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:07.905
of why [INAUDIBLE]
euro, dollar, whatever.

00:21:07.905 --> 00:21:09.280
The stable dollar
already exceeds

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.170
in the cryptocurrency market.

00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:15.040
And I even, in that case, fully
understand what [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:17.092
with less fees.

00:21:17.092 --> 00:21:17.800
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.170
So, Romain, Victor was
cutting in and out.

00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:24.880
I think, if I understood the
question, is back to Facebook

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:29.230
and why they have the stable
individual currencies,

00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:30.340
but I'm not certain.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:31.630
I'm sorry.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:37.180
So around the globe,
there are definitely

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:41.950
shortcomings of our fiat payment
systems, these pain points.

00:21:41.950 --> 00:21:45.430
Some of it just relates to
whether the payment systems

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:47.800
are 24 hours a day,
seven days a week.

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:53.230
In terms of the euro, actually
the target payment system

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:59.950
run by the European Central Bank
does have attributes of 24/7.

00:21:59.950 --> 00:22:03.050
The US-- we have more
challenges in that regard.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:08.050
But the bigger issue often
in payment systems are costs.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:13.680
And so what Facebook
Libra is saying is,

00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:19.440
we can provide something that
can compete in this space.

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:22.560
But money is already
digital Fiat money,

00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:23.940
the euro is already digital.

00:22:23.940 --> 00:22:26.490
So Libra and Facebook
are not providing that.

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:29.330
They're saying this is
a different digital euro

00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:32.130
or a different digital
dollar that can maybe

00:22:32.130 --> 00:22:35.160
move 24 hours a day,
seven days a week

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.080
where you can get
instantaneous settlement.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:39.990
Now, the US Federal
Reserve is moving there.

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.300
And we'll be there
by 2023 or '24.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:45.970
And in fact, even in the
US, the clearinghouse,

00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:47.820
as we talked about,
the organization

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:53.130
of about 24 major banks have
it in a continuous real time

00:22:53.130 --> 00:22:54.300
payment system.

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:57.540
Europe is already moving to that
continuous real time payment

00:22:57.540 --> 00:22:58.040
system.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:03.240
So you might say, why would a
Libra euro compete with that?

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.880
Partly because it would be
on the Facebook platform.

00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:10.620
And the thought is that
Facebook would embed it

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.850
into their system.

00:23:12.850 --> 00:23:14.800
It's to some extent
to try to compete

00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.890
with what Amazon, and
Alibaba, and Tencent

00:23:17.890 --> 00:23:20.800
are doing elsewhere as well.

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.580
But implied in your
question is, so what?

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:26.270
Why would this matter?

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.210
And I think it's a
competitive landscape.

00:23:28.210 --> 00:23:31.750
And time will tell us whether
it will really matter.

00:23:31.750 --> 00:23:33.700
Because we already
had digital euros.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:36.920
This would be a different
form of a digital euro.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
of an overlap, I guess.

00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:40.205
GARY GENSLER: That's right.

00:23:40.205 --> 00:23:41.320
That's right.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.120
TA: And I think, Gary,
on the same topic,

00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.667
we might have a
question from Luke.

00:23:44.667 --> 00:23:45.500
GARY GENSLER: It is.

00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.340
Luke?

00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:48.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.500
GARY GENSLER: Again, Luke
is not coming through.

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:51.220
I don't know.

00:23:51.220 --> 00:23:52.450
AUDIENCE: I'm here.

00:23:52.450 --> 00:23:54.970
So each question is, what
is the main difference

00:23:54.970 --> 00:23:58.420
between Libra 1.0 and the 2.0?

00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:01.600
Because 1.0, I believe, was
suggesting currency basket.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.680
And second question was
regarding LendingClub.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.040
It's down a lot--

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.210
42% in three months and
93% since five years.

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:14.890
And will it drive during this
consumer equity crunch that

00:24:14.890 --> 00:24:18.310
is the quarantine
recession we have now

00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.800
or suffer from high leverage?

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.410
Because it acquired a
brick and mortar bank,

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:25.890
which seems untimely these days.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:29.460
And regarding the
currency basket,

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:31.750
wouldn't it suffer
during economy downturns

00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:34.600
when there's a distortion
between safe currencies

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:42.070
such as the US dollar, Swiss
franc, and the emerging market

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.000
currency that is R&B or
whatever they're really

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.308
putting in the basket?

00:24:47.308 --> 00:24:48.100
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.780
First, let me compliment.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:52.380
I love the Edvard Munch
that you have behind you.

00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:54.820
I assume it's just a visual.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:59.210
But if it's an original,
protected safely.

00:24:59.210 --> 00:25:01.600
To your second
question, LendingClub,

00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:05.650
I think that all of
the marketplace lenders

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:09.010
have some challenges in the
middle of the corona crisis.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:13.310
I think that their early promise
has improved that completely.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.940
So you're right that it went--

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:17.380
it's a public
company, actually--

00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:17.950
LendingClub.

00:25:17.950 --> 00:25:19.020
It went public.

00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.970
Its stock came off
dramatically, 70% or 80%,

00:25:21.970 --> 00:25:26.860
even well before
this corona crisis.

00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:31.120
Then within the crisis, it's
come off some more as well.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.140
It's buying a bank.

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:34.120
It's not technically a
bricks and mortar bank.

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:37.660
That bank, I think, has one
location in Massachusetts,

00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.550
maybe in Boston.

00:25:39.550 --> 00:25:41.380
It's an online bank.

00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.150
And what they're trying to do--

00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:45.670
their theory of the
case is that they want

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.440
to lower their borrowing costs.

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.260
Because marketplace
lenders-- and we'll see this

00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:51.690
in a moment--

00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:57.060
arrange with some
banks to borrow money.

00:25:57.060 --> 00:26:01.000
So marketplace lenders
are from the markets.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.200
Some of it's securitized,
some from banks.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:06.540
And what they're saying is,
we can maybe lower our costs

00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.060
by embedding a bank.

00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:12.510
Back to Libra, and
Facebook, and the like,

00:26:12.510 --> 00:26:17.030
the main difference
between Libra 1.0 and 2.0

00:26:17.030 --> 00:26:18.362
are the two that I mentioned.

00:26:18.362 --> 00:26:20.820
I mean, they would say there's
three or four other changes.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:28.320
But one is rather than only be
a multi-currency coin, Libra,

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:30.275
they're adding individual coins.

00:26:30.275 --> 00:26:32.400
They're not getting rid of
the multi-currency coin.

00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:34.780
The multi-currency
coin is still there.

00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:38.310
It's still their aspiration
to have a multi-currency coin.

00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:40.830
But they're adding
the single coins

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:45.070
to try to give a new euro
digital dollar to it.

00:26:45.070 --> 00:26:47.865
And secondly, they're
adding much more--

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:54.710
know your customer anti-money
laundering regimes by saying,

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:59.290
look, we're only going to work
with digital wallets and crypto

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:02.160
exchanges in certain
jurisdictions which

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.160
are registered and following
anti-money laundering law.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:11.590
And additionally, we'll embed
in the software some protocols,

00:27:11.590 --> 00:27:16.390
literally in the software to
guard against either sanctions

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:17.620
and some other things.

00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:21.250
Whether this will be enough to
satisfy the official sector,

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:22.540
yet to be seen.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:24.880
It looks like they're moving
first with Switzerland

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:29.070
and trying to have Switzerland's
regulator, FINMA, capture

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:30.597
it and move forward.

00:27:30.597 --> 00:27:32.680
I'll take one brief-- more
question, because we've

00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.140
got a lot to cover, but sure.

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:38.230
TA: So Cindy had
her hand up for one.

00:27:38.230 --> 00:27:40.855
If you want to talk,
unmute yourself, please.

00:27:40.855 --> 00:27:41.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.690
I'll just ask briefly.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:48.100
But with household
private sectors,

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:52.390
how are they preventing
against predatory lending?

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.850
Because just through reading
some of the articles,

00:27:55.850 --> 00:28:00.850
it seems like that becomes a
gray line when you're targeting

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.270
specific type of
customer who doesn't

00:28:04.270 --> 00:28:07.427
qualify for traditional loans.

00:28:07.427 --> 00:28:09.760
GARY GENSLER: So you're talking
about more broadly, just

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.750
in terms of, how do we
guard in any country

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:15.090
against predatory lending?

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:16.850
It's hard.

00:28:16.850 --> 00:28:17.650
It's hard.

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:23.140
The entire credit space
has a lot of protections

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:26.260
and regulations starting in--

00:28:26.260 --> 00:28:30.220
well, I would say starting
hundreds of years ago, really.

00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.590
One would even go back
to the Hammurabi Code

00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.950
and say there was regulation
of interest rates.

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:38.350
But in the modern
days, we embedded--

00:28:38.350 --> 00:28:40.840
let's take the US for a moment.

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.570
Two really important things.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.010
One was the Equal
Credit Opportunity

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:48.550
Act or what some
people call ECOA,

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.347
which was in the
late 1960s and then

00:28:51.347 --> 00:28:53.680
something called the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, I think,

00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:54.880
by 1972.

00:28:54.880 --> 00:29:00.490
These two came out of an earlier
way, the fintech, an earlier

00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:05.950
wave of credit cards, an
earlier wave of lending

00:29:05.950 --> 00:29:10.818
and directly to this question
about whether it was fair

00:29:10.818 --> 00:29:11.860
and whether it was equal.

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:15.790
Everybody had the same access,
Equal Credit Opportunity Act,

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.790
that you couldn't differentiate
because of gender, or race,

00:29:18.790 --> 00:29:23.800
or nationality, and the like
and Fair Credit Reporting,

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.470
that those credit reports.

00:29:25.470 --> 00:29:31.270
The things that we came to know
and in about 30 countries rely

00:29:31.270 --> 00:29:35.440
on, is these FICO scores from
a company called the Fair Isaac

00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:38.170
company, that those scores--

00:29:38.170 --> 00:29:40.710
we'd have to be able to
know something about them.

00:29:40.710 --> 00:29:43.120
And if we were
turned down, somebody

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.980
has to explain to us
how we were turned down.

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:50.950
Well, now, fast forward to 2020.

00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:51.790
Absolutely.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:52.840
The question is right.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.770
How can we protect that
we still have equal credit

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:59.110
and that it's explainable?

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.980
And why is somebody turned down?

00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:06.310
And once somebody is not
allowed to take credit,

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:09.400
it gets tougher with artificial
intelligence and machine

00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:09.980
learning.

00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:11.530
It also gets tougher
when there's not

00:30:11.530 --> 00:30:13.510
a physical location.

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:15.550
And thirdly, many
of these companies

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:19.030
are not regulated or
registered as banks.

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.760
And regulators around
the globe tended

00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:27.670
to look to banks to make
sure that these laws were

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:28.780
fairly applied.

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.850
Now, they also look to the
credit reporting agencies.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:35.740
So I think the real answer
is in these changing times,

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.860
the official sector
around the globe

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:43.570
has to adapt and sometimes
change a little bit of who

00:30:43.570 --> 00:30:47.110
is regulated and even if you're
a non-bank, that you still

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:50.417
have to comply with some of
these things, importantly.

00:30:50.417 --> 00:30:51.250
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:53.448 --> 00:30:54.990
GARY GENSLER: So
let me just give you

00:30:54.990 --> 00:30:56.460
a sense of the size and scope.

00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:59.280
The household sector--
you can look at this later

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.010
in the Canvas slides, but
the household sector--

00:31:02.010 --> 00:31:03.610
grown dramatically.

00:31:03.610 --> 00:31:08.100
And if you look in
the United States,

00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.510
we're no longer the
top percent of GDP.

00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:16.380
In fact, I think
Luke is in Korea now.

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:18.980
Your country is now peaked
up to be number two.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:20.280
But look at China.

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:25.440
China from 10 to 20% of
GDP just 15 years ago.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:28.080
And all of a sudden, 50% of GDP.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.990
So these markets have grown
a lot in many countries.

00:31:30.990 --> 00:31:33.990
I wouldn't just think
about this in the US.

00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:36.510
And Brazil and India--

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.220
I would predict, will grow
significantly as well.

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:44.730
Now, in the US, we've got about
$14 trillion of household debt.

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.690
Before the corona crisis, we
had at $22 trillion economy.

00:31:48.690 --> 00:31:50.970
And so you could
see it's about 2/3

00:31:50.970 --> 00:31:55.590
of our economy, the underlying
consumer household debt.

00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:58.635
The corporate sector--
very important as well.

00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.610
But it's the household
sector dominated in the US

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:07.710
by mortgages--

00:32:07.710 --> 00:32:11.730
2/3 of that 2/3 or about
$10 trillion, $11 trillion

00:32:11.730 --> 00:32:14.760
of mortgage market.

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.820
But each of these markets
are really significant.

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:20.190
Even the auto lending market--

00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:27.360
it might look small at these
numbers here, but they're not.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:30.210
That's a big number
when you come at it

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:32.550
and if you wanted to
pursue that business.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:35.340
And a little bit on the
non-financial corporate debt

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.290
market--

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:38.930
we'll see this shake out.

00:32:38.930 --> 00:32:42.000
Post the corona crisis,
a lot of these numbers

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.860
will go up significantly.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.090
And I would say one thing
just off the topic of fintech.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:52.800
I think that though we
didn't enter this crisis

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:57.100
with a household debt
problem in most countries,

00:32:57.100 --> 00:33:01.550
we had a real household debt
problem going into 2008 crisis.

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:04.890
While we didn't enter this
with a household debt crisis,

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:07.210
within three to six
months in most countries,

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:09.690
we will have a household
debt crisis, I fear.

00:33:09.690 --> 00:33:16.120
Because the consumer sector
can't be supporting their auto

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.130
loans and credit card loans.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.750
And one of the
reasons I think this

00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:22.420
is unlikely to be
of the recession,

00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:24.490
but it's going to be
a long U recession,

00:33:24.490 --> 00:33:26.110
almost like it's
a bathtub trying

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:29.590
to get out the slippery
slopes of this recession,

00:33:29.590 --> 00:33:31.870
is around the globe,
households are

00:33:31.870 --> 00:33:34.440
going to have to repair
their balance sheets.

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:36.760
You're going to have to
slowly repair balance sheets.

00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:40.990
And it's not going to
be easy, so true also

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.990
in the corporate
sector, most likely.

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.850
But the market design matters--

00:33:45.850 --> 00:33:48.710
if you are creating
a fintech company,

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:51.190
you would think about
the market design.

00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:53.420
And I'm not going
to dive into this.

00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:56.530
But each one of these
pieces gives an opportunity

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:58.570
to break into the
credit markets.

00:33:58.570 --> 00:34:00.400
It might be around data.

00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:05.110
You might have a particular area
that you could do better data

00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:06.940
or like Credit Karma.

00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:12.610
Credit Karma was really about
providing free credit scoring.

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.610
Think about this-- just
free credit scores.

00:34:15.610 --> 00:34:18.880
And Credit Karma then
could cross sell and market

00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:22.060
your products Credit
Karma company was

00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.654
formed less than 10 years
ago, sold earlier in 2020

00:34:26.654 --> 00:34:31.030
for $5 billion to
Intuit, Intuit that

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:36.370
has the TurboTax,
and this accounting

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.630
software, and the like.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:45.030
But Credit Karma had 106
million individual files

00:34:45.030 --> 00:34:49.260
on various folks, not all
of whom are their customers.

00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:50.610
But they cross sell.

00:34:50.610 --> 00:34:53.790
They had nearly a billion
dollars in revenue in 2019.

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.290
It might be on the funding side.

00:34:55.290 --> 00:34:59.310
You might have a new way to do
securitization or your issuer

00:34:59.310 --> 00:35:00.307
bank partnership.

00:35:00.307 --> 00:35:01.140
And we talked about.

00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:03.780
LendingClub had an
issuer bank partner.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:06.690
Now, they're trying
to buy a bank.

00:35:06.690 --> 00:35:08.670
It might be on the funding side.

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:11.750
And that's what peer-to-peer
lending tried to do.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:14.970
And they haven't been
as broadly successful.

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:18.300
Most importantly, I would
say that it's usually

00:35:18.300 --> 00:35:21.510
been on user experience
and user interface.

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:24.660
And sometimes it's that you
got in through the payment

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:28.710
channels, like Toast getting
into the restaurant sector

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:29.970
through the payment.

00:35:29.970 --> 00:35:32.280
Toast was a company
out of Boston.

00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.900
It was really about software.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:35.760
It was about
tablets and hardware

00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:41.160
as well, that the restaurant
server had a better user

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:42.000
experience.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.980
And the restaurant had
a better experience

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:46.980
in the tablet and payment side.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:49.260
And then they started
to build Toast credit

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.660
to provide those
restaurants credit.

00:35:51.660 --> 00:35:54.210
Now, there's going to be a
shakeout there, no doubt,

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.170
in terms of this crisis,
the corona crisis.

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:02.560
It might be that you're breaking
into some slice of risk.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:05.760
And this has been a case
for a lot of companies

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.820
that have broken into manage
one risk or another better.

00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.640
And then lastly,
what role are you in?

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.260
In the mortgage markets here
in the US-- and we found

00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:20.570
that origination
has really changed.

00:36:20.570 --> 00:36:22.490
And we'll look at the
competitive landscape.

00:36:22.490 --> 00:36:26.810
But companies like Quicken
Loan, and PennyMac, and others

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:28.160
have broken in.

00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:30.260
And they've broken in
on the origination side.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:33.410
And that's partly because the
uniqueness in the US mortgage

00:36:33.410 --> 00:36:34.250
market--

00:36:34.250 --> 00:36:37.100
that our government-sponsored
enterprises guarantee

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:39.000
the bulk of the market.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.040
So the balance sheet
credit risk is diminished.

00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.380
And Quicken Loan, and PennyMac,
and others can come in.

00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.520
And probably over
half the market

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.700
is originated by
companies that are broadly

00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.130
speaking disruptors.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:56.750
So again, it could be data.

00:36:56.750 --> 00:36:57.630
It could be funding.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:59.630
It could be the user
experience, which

00:36:59.630 --> 00:37:04.340
is really a critical one,
maybe the risks, the roles.

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.980
Any piece of these might
give an opportunity

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:10.100
to break into a market or
to do something different

00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:11.720
than the financial incumbents.

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:20.140
So the earlier
fintech, way back--

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.840
I'm going to take you to a
story about an earlier fintech

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.530
that I like.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:25.900
It's just credit cards.

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:27.640
The first use of
the term credit card

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:31.690
was in the 1880s
in a dystopian--

00:37:31.690 --> 00:37:33.880
I would call it, but
utopian book that

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:35.830
was written by Edward Bellamy.

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:37.780
It was a New York
Times bestseller.

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.170
It was a bestseller in multiple
languages around the globe,

00:37:41.170 --> 00:37:43.570
talking about the year 2000.

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:46.030
Well, Bellamy-- you could go
back and look at the book.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:48.010
It's really science fiction.

00:37:48.010 --> 00:37:50.890
But use the term credit card.

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.020
It's the first known
use of the concept

00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:56.920
that you would have
a card for payments.

00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:00.400
Well, shortly thereafter, not
really because of Bellamy,

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:03.880
you saw a bunch of companies
starting to use charge coins

00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.020
and charge cards.

00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:08.980
And by the 1920s,
these merchant cards--

00:38:08.980 --> 00:38:12.970
you had an individual merchant
providing credit and saying you

00:38:12.970 --> 00:38:14.860
can buy something on credit.

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.380
You could call that a
point-of-sale credit.

00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:20.320
Earlier fintech-- about
a hundred years ago.

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:26.230
But in the 1940s, one
banker in Brooklyn

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.720
never made a lot of
money for themselves.

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:34.900
One banker came up with the
concept of a credit system

00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:38.170
where it was multiple merchants.

00:38:38.170 --> 00:38:41.410
Not one merchant, but
multiple merchants.

00:38:41.410 --> 00:38:43.720
And that charge card--

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:49.420
75 years ago, so a long time
ago, but still somewhat recent.

00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.030
And that led to
the 1940s and '50s,

00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:55.060
all these innovations--
the first plastic card.

00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:58.300
BankAmericard was from
a California bank.

00:38:58.300 --> 00:39:00.430
And that's where Visa started.

00:39:00.430 --> 00:39:03.850
So all of that was
fintech of the time.

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:05.460
And the only reason
I mention it is

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:08.740
if you think about what
disruptions have come before

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:11.260
that now we take for
granted, sometimes

00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.960
that's evidence in
what you might do now.

00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.590
BankAmericard was
a California bank

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:20.980
that was trying to partner with
other banks around the country

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.480
and partnered with
other countries

00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:27.280
to do something that was more
universal for the country.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:30.490
The Diners Club was literally
about this restaurant concept.

00:39:30.490 --> 00:39:32.710
You would consider it almost
like a general merchant

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.720
card, an early Toast.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.940
The Diners Club did
what maybe Toast

00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.880
is trying to do now,
inside the restaurants,

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:45.910
providing more use of those
initially high-end restaurants

00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:46.840
on the East Coast.

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:53.360
So what disruptions are
in the value chain now?

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:57.510
And particularly,
this little chart--

00:39:57.510 --> 00:40:02.120
I borrow from an interesting
long paper on it,

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:04.940
is think about the different
parts of the value chain.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.100
Whether you're sourcing
capital, you're

00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.420
actually assessing credit.

00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:10.430
That's the underwriting
of the credit

00:40:10.430 --> 00:40:13.040
or actually just
servicing the credit

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:15.360
like you're servicing
a student loan.

00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:18.150
It can be any part
of the value chain.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:19.550
And you could go in and disrupt.

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.890
And we're not going to
dive into this chart.

00:40:21.890 --> 00:40:24.147
But I'll just take
disbursements for a minute.

00:40:24.147 --> 00:40:25.730
If you look at that
vertical, it could

00:40:25.730 --> 00:40:28.580
be digital wallets,
or virtual currency,

00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.200
or the machine learning.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:34.470
If it's in credit assessment, it
could be the alternative data.

00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:37.970
So each of these provides
a little opportunity

00:40:37.970 --> 00:40:41.540
to disrupt the current
business model.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.350
And so we talked about
payments last class, credit.

00:40:44.350 --> 00:40:46.660
You really have to
get, in a sense,

00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:49.930
granular into which
part of the value chain.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.510
And then, how do I
bring a technology to it

00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:54.430
that maybe the big
incumbents aren't yet

00:40:54.430 --> 00:40:58.300
doing in a sufficiently
sophisticated way?

00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.130
Or you might just
bring it to one sector

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.560
like Toast did to the
restaurant sector.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:05.020
It might be sector specific.

00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.640
So where do we go?

00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:09.400
Well, we've already
seen big techs there,

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.350
the payment unicorns.

00:41:11.350 --> 00:41:13.300
There's hundreds of
other payment companies

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:17.480
that are building credit
on top of payment.

00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:21.080
And sometimes a payment
company is really also a credit

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:26.070
company, like Brex is
both payment and credit.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:28.640
AvidXchange is mostly
payment, but is

00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:35.040
moving into credit and then some
that are built just on credit.

00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:38.540
And so I thought I would
start with the business side--

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.240
small, medium-sized
enterprise lending.

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:44.380
Again, there's no really
good definition of SME.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:46.970
But the definition that these
companies would take at it--

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:49.760
they would say
these are companies

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:53.420
that are having difficulty
borrowing from the big banks.

00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:57.870
It's either assessing
credit or providing

00:41:57.870 --> 00:42:03.370
that credit in a timely
and a cost-effective way.

00:42:03.370 --> 00:42:06.640
Brex is an interesting company
that started around the concept

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:11.560
that, I can't get
money as a startup.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:14.300
How can I even get a
credit card if I had a--

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:24.220
it's a mixture of seed investing
and credit card provisions.

00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:26.800
Some of these companies I
put on here like Amazon,

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.750
Alipay are big tech.

00:42:28.750 --> 00:42:30.370
I don't think you
can leave them out.

00:42:30.370 --> 00:42:33.190
Some started in the
payment side like Square

00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:36.280
and Stripe and Toast--

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.140
which I mentioned earlier--

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.190
PayPal.

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:42.460
All provide small and
medium-sized enterprise

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:43.350
lending.

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:48.520
Some are really just
like Kabbage and Lendio,

00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:53.770
provide comparison, that you can
go on the Lendio prop platform,

00:42:53.770 --> 00:42:56.190
and you can compare
and contrast.

00:42:56.190 --> 00:42:59.200
They're more like a
broker or an agent

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.310
than actually
making the lending.

00:43:02.310 --> 00:43:05.050
And Funding Circle is
one of the only ones

00:43:05.050 --> 00:43:08.700
that is a little bit in
the marketplace lending.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:11.100
Do I see some questions, Romain?

00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:13.980
I'm doing a thumbnail
taste test here.

00:43:17.072 --> 00:43:19.030
TA: So in the chat,
there's quite some activity

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.145
about LendingClub.

00:43:20.145 --> 00:43:21.520
Perhaps you can
provide the class

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.680
with an overview of
their business model.

00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:25.920
And what are the challenges
they've been facing?

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:26.920
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:31.030
I'm going to do that
in about 10 minutes.

00:43:31.030 --> 00:43:35.020
So I'll hold that if I can.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:38.740
LendingClub has been more
about the household sector

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:41.110
than the small and medium size.

00:43:41.110 --> 00:43:42.010
I'll ask this.

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.530
Has anybody in the
class actually worked

00:43:44.530 --> 00:43:48.400
at a startup, worked at any
corporation that's barred

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:49.660
from one of these companies?

00:43:54.970 --> 00:43:57.620
TA: Alida, you've
unmuted yourself.

00:43:57.620 --> 00:43:58.223
Yeah?

00:43:58.223 --> 00:44:00.640
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I was
at Citibank at the time,

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:05.990
that Citibank partners with
C2FO as a partnered [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:06.490
program.

00:44:06.490 --> 00:44:11.140
We financed some of the smaller
suppliers in those programs

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.030
by large [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:13.030 --> 00:44:14.570
GARY GENSLER: So
it's interesting.

00:44:14.570 --> 00:44:15.380
Could you share?

00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:21.460
Why did Citibank partner
with C2FO, rather than

00:44:21.460 --> 00:44:23.120
make those loans themselves?

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:24.480
And this is an important--

00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:26.650
the relationship
with the incumbents

00:44:26.650 --> 00:44:28.140
between the disruptors.

00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:30.400
Why in that one
circumstance do you

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:35.387
think Citi chose to partner,
rather than do it on their own?

00:44:35.387 --> 00:44:37.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] an
interesting model that actually

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.550
allows the corporate to
lend to its suppliers

00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:43.735
is the easiest way
to say it would

00:44:43.735 --> 00:44:45.640
have been short-term firm.

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.530
But if you look at a
company and supplier base,

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.720
you'll see that 80/20
rule applies fairly well.

00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:56.770
So the top 20
suppliers are generally

00:44:56.770 --> 00:45:00.400
supplying appropriate with the
majority of their inventory.

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:05.410
[INAUDIBLE] Purchasing on that
bottom tail of the suppliers

00:45:05.410 --> 00:45:06.100
is--

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.860
they're all very
small businesses.

00:45:07.860 --> 00:45:08.860
They're hard to lend to.

00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:14.440
It's very hard to do all
the KYC requirements, which

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.240
is really what Citibank does
not like doing [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.920
And so a company
like C2FO could come

00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:23.500
in there, partner with
a corporate [INAUDIBLE],,

00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:27.777
and lend to or extend credit
to a supplier [INAUDIBLE]..

00:45:27.777 --> 00:45:29.610
GARY GENSLER: So this
is an important aspect

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:30.940
that Alida just raised.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:33.130
Large incumbents
sometimes don't feel

00:45:33.130 --> 00:45:36.580
that they can, in a
cost-effective way,

00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:39.250
assess the credit and
reach the distribution

00:45:39.250 --> 00:45:41.200
to small businesses.

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.570
And then the disruptive
companies say, well, wait,

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:44.380
we could provide.

00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:46.090
That's a little
crack in the system.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:48.850
That's something we can have
more financial inclusion,

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:50.740
whether it's Brex
for the startups,

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:56.650
C2FO for a lot of the small
businesses, and the like.

00:45:56.650 --> 00:45:59.020
And the incumbents say
all right, we can't.

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:04.520
But we can, through C2FO
and others, reach them.

00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.530
And then it helps
down the supply chain.

00:46:06.530 --> 00:46:08.170
I think Ivy's hand
was up, maybe?

00:46:08.170 --> 00:46:08.930
TA: Yes, correct.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:11.545
Ivy, go ahead.

00:46:11.545 --> 00:46:12.170
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:14.600
So I use to work
in securitization.

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:18.480
And Brex is one of my
clients and then also worked

00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.700
at a startup that
uses Brex, too.

00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:24.770
And so I think, though,
to your point of--

00:46:24.770 --> 00:46:27.530
their user interface
is pretty amazing.

00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:31.430
And they've also just
have really identified

00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:33.920
this white space of startups.

00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:35.810
But I think where
we got comfortable

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:42.080
in terms of the diligence is the
fact that they're pretty much--

00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:46.160
it's a very elegant way of just
having these startups making

00:46:46.160 --> 00:46:49.680
sure that they have literally
enough cash in the account.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:51.770
So they're monitoring that.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:54.560
Basically, if you have
access to these startups,

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.150
bank account, day to day.

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:57.980
And they started with startups.

00:46:57.980 --> 00:47:01.460
And they've been very, I
think, thoughtful about which

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:04.880
sectors they're going to, like
life sciences, and e-commerce,

00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.110
and now having cash management,
which also makes a lot of sense

00:47:09.110 --> 00:47:12.410
in terms of just having
yield, so just wanted to offer

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.180
a little bit more color there.

00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:17.150
GARY GENSLER: And Brex
started with this concept

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:20.780
of, how does entrepreneurs
get money when you

00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:22.590
don't have any track record?

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:23.090
Right?

00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:24.882
Literally, you don't
have any track record.

00:47:24.882 --> 00:47:28.400
They had to also
rely on something

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:29.660
we've talked about already--

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:30.680
OpenAPI.

00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:31.950
They had to get data.

00:47:31.950 --> 00:47:33.440
And they had to do
it, as you said,

00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:38.120
in an efficient, elegant way to
get that data and get access.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.640
Do you have cash in your
account, so to speak?

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:44.240
And now, they've grown
up a certain expertise

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:47.380
in that startup world.

00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.490
And it's not equity
that they're funding.

00:47:49.490 --> 00:47:53.660
It's loans, basically,
against the cash flow.

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.420
What you'll see also
on here is, as I

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.480
said, some of the big
tech companies like Amazon

00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.340
and Tencent and Alipay.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.400
You see some of the really,
now incumbent fintechs,

00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:08.430
as some folks would call
them, like Stripe and Square

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:13.940
and PayPal and Intuit that have
built up a long history now,

00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:18.260
either in the payment space or
in the tax prep and accounting

00:48:18.260 --> 00:48:20.660
space, as some have
come from accounting.

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.700
Some have come from
the payment side

00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:25.370
where they're getting data
and corporate business

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:26.840
relationships.

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.958
What you don't see is a
lot of the challenger banks

00:48:29.958 --> 00:48:32.000
that we're going to talk
about in our next class.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.740
Now, Prosper is here.

00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:35.390
They've started to
offer some lending

00:48:35.390 --> 00:48:36.920
side to the corporate side.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:39.890
Most of the challenger
banks and nearly all

00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:43.430
of the marketplace
lenders that are of size

00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:45.350
are in the household
sector, rather than

00:48:45.350 --> 00:48:49.260
the corporate sector,
which I find of interest.

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.950
I don't if there's a question.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:53.240
TA: We have two hands raised--

00:48:53.240 --> 00:48:54.400
Camillo and then Carlos.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:55.400
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:48:55.400 --> 00:48:59.180
And then we're going to go
to the household sector.

00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:01.740
AUDIENCE: OK, this is
about the household.

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.610
I'm sure you know about this
Brazilian unicorn called

00:49:05.610 --> 00:49:06.372
Nubank.

00:49:06.372 --> 00:49:07.580
GARY GENSLER: Oh, absolutely.

00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:07.770
Yeah.

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:10.103
And we're going to be talking
about Nubank a fair amount

00:49:10.103 --> 00:49:11.338
next Monday as well.

00:49:11.338 --> 00:49:11.880
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:13.520
I just want to know--

00:49:13.520 --> 00:49:14.780
well, maybe next class.

00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:18.750
Do you think that their
business model about giving

00:49:18.750 --> 00:49:21.180
online credit cards to--

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.440
I don't know.

00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:27.450
I think it's 8.5 million people
already, who have a Nubank

00:49:27.450 --> 00:49:30.680
credit card, is sustainable.

00:49:30.680 --> 00:49:34.030
Because I don't know what's
their specific innovation,

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:37.410
apart from accepting
applications

00:49:37.410 --> 00:49:38.940
on line of credit cards.

00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:42.280
Just I'm wondering if
that's going to be--

00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:46.090
are they are going to have
some [INAUDIBLE] problem?

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:48.670
GARY GENSLER: We'll dive more
into Nubank in the next class.

00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:50.250
But let me just
generically say, I

00:49:50.250 --> 00:49:55.200
think that it's the
reality of startups that

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.690
more will fail than succeed.

00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:00.540
Now, as it specifically
relates to credit cards,

00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:07.980
in the credit card
space, the big incumbents

00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.780
aren't going to keep
the whole market.

00:50:09.780 --> 00:50:13.530
And maybe that leads
me for a minute.

00:50:13.530 --> 00:50:16.860
I'm going to come back
to mortgages in a second.

00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:18.510
This is the US
credit card system.

00:50:18.510 --> 00:50:20.070
It's not Brazil.

00:50:20.070 --> 00:50:23.280
But the big seven, what
I call, or the big eight

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.530
being the big four
or five banks--

00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:28.920
American Express,
Discover, and Cap One--

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:34.020
control 80%, 78%
as of last year--

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.280
credit card business.

00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:37.980
There are a lot of
economies of scale.

00:50:37.980 --> 00:50:41.160
There's a lot of economies of
scale back to managing risk

00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:42.660
and balance sheet.

00:50:42.660 --> 00:50:45.150
Credit cards as
opposed to mortgages

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:48.510
are not guaranteed in any
way by the US government.

00:50:48.510 --> 00:50:51.870
It has a very
different risk profile.

00:50:51.870 --> 00:50:57.000
This is about a little over
$1 trillion asset class market

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.820
in the US.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:02.010
But 22% are smaller providers.

00:51:02.010 --> 00:51:06.390
And so Amazon, for instance,
partners with Synchrony Bank.

00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:08.910
And Amazon has the
Synchrony card.

00:51:08.910 --> 00:51:11.310
Amazon also, I think, has
something with JP Morgan

00:51:11.310 --> 00:51:12.150
as well.

00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:14.760
You'd probably say Amazon
will be sustainable.

00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.500
Amazon is such a phenomenal
profit generator,

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:21.690
particularly with
the crisis now.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:24.360
I can't speak to
any one startup.

00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:27.780
Can they chip away at this 22%?

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.930
Yes, they can by using
alternative data.

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:33.540
But the big seven or
eight are not asleep.

00:51:33.540 --> 00:51:36.230
They're not ignoring
alternative data.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:39.060
But a new startup
can say, maybe we

00:51:39.060 --> 00:51:41.860
can approach this
in a different way

00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.930
and particularly provide
a better user interface.

00:51:45.930 --> 00:51:49.680
Here in the US, what's happening
is rather than credit card

00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:54.030
products, they're
providing personal loans.

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:56.250
But let me hold on
that for a second,

00:51:56.250 --> 00:52:00.220
because I want to go back
to the mortgage market.

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:03.370
I mentioned this in
the mortgage market.

00:52:03.370 --> 00:52:05.160
These are figures from 2018.

00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:09.030
These are the largest mortgage
originators in the US.

00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:11.040
It doesn't mean that
they bought these loans

00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.020
and held them on
their balance sheet.

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:16.500
The yellow are the non-banks.

00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:19.050
And PennyMac, for some
reason, is not on here.

00:52:19.050 --> 00:52:20.540
They should be.

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:26.670
But of the top 10, 5,
the yellow are non-banks.

00:52:26.670 --> 00:52:29.010
Now, do we call them fintechs?

00:52:29.010 --> 00:52:29.830
Absolutely.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:35.920
They are giving a different
user interface with the public,

00:52:35.920 --> 00:52:37.700
and they've just taken off.

00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:39.170
Part of it is regulatory.

00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:42.140
Part of it is since
the 2008 crisis.

00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:43.970
Holding loans on
the balance sheets

00:52:43.970 --> 00:52:46.460
become less attractive
to the big banks.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:50.180
In terms of their capital
charges and the like,

00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:52.280
part of it is also
because in the US,

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.880
this is highly tied to
the government-sponsored

00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:56.990
enterprises.

00:52:56.990 --> 00:53:00.560
But big disruption in the
last 12 years, that about half

00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:03.930
of the loans are originated
by, broadly speaking,

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:08.210
yeah, the non-banks sector who
are largely then laying it off

00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:11.930
to the asset
securitization marketplace.

00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:13.640
Disruption of the past--

00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.290
I believe there'll
still be disruption

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:17.830
in the future in this space.

00:53:17.830 --> 00:53:19.960
Back to the credit
card side, what we

00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.730
were talking about
there with Camillo--

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:24.010
and I'll pause if
there's other questions.

00:53:24.010 --> 00:53:26.650
I just want to take
a look also at China.

00:53:26.650 --> 00:53:29.800
China's biggest
credit card issuers--

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.040
all that are building upon
that UnionPay platform

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:33.760
we talked about.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:38.530
UnionPay was started by, I
think, 84 banks in China,

00:53:38.530 --> 00:53:41.380
really with the People's Bank
of China bringing that together.

00:53:41.380 --> 00:53:46.690
UnionPay is that one backbone of
their whole credit card payment

00:53:46.690 --> 00:53:47.890
system.

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:52.180
Interestingly, as dominant and
as strong as Alipay and WeChat

00:53:52.180 --> 00:53:53.200
Pay are--

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.690
and in a sense,
WeChat Pay and Alipay

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:58.290
leapfrogged the banking system.

00:53:58.290 --> 00:54:02.260
There's real growth going on
in the credit card business,

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:04.840
but not from disruptors
and startups.

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.850
It's like the commercial
banks getting back into it.

00:54:08.850 --> 00:54:10.990
Romain where there
some questions?

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:12.350
TA: Yes, Alessandro?

00:54:12.350 --> 00:54:15.060
GARY GENSLER: Please.

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:15.900
AUDIENCE: Yes, Gary.

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:19.710
I'd like to get your point of
view on the following topic.

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:23.400
So I was thinking about
how these new credit card--

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.080
think that companies work.

00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:27.900
And most of them,
not all of them--

00:54:27.900 --> 00:54:31.080
they got to partner up
with the bank, right?

00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:33.820
Unless they have huge
amount of cash anticipated,

00:54:33.820 --> 00:54:37.587
they got to partner up with a
bank that gives actual credit.

00:54:37.587 --> 00:54:38.920
GARY GENSLER: Let me just pause.

00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:42.270
They either have to partner
with a bank, which is the issuer

00:54:42.270 --> 00:54:43.680
bank partner model.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.380
And we're going to get to
LendingClub, I promise,

00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:50.220
that has that issuer partner,
that bank that's a partner.

00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.210
Or they tap into the
securitization markets.

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.760
And so for those who
are not familiar,

00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.920
asset securitization
is the concept

00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:04.130
that the securities markets
are the investors in the loans,

00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.590
rather than holding
it on a bank's balance

00:55:06.590 --> 00:55:09.560
sheet or a finance
company's balance sheet.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:12.980
And that innovation, asset
securitization starting

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:17.480
in the mortgage markets
40-plus years ago moved

00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:24.470
to the credit card markets
in a robust way by the 1990s,

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:29.000
is a very real way
to lay off that side,

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000
meaning find somebody
else to be the investors,

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.390
rather than have
a balance sheet.

00:55:33.390 --> 00:55:34.700
So back to you, Alexandro.

00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:39.010
It's either a partner bank
or asset securitization.

00:55:39.010 --> 00:55:41.620
AUDIENCE: So in the
end, these guys,

00:55:41.620 --> 00:55:46.750
these fintech companies are
second intermediary, right?

00:55:46.750 --> 00:55:49.810
So how much money do
they actually make?

00:55:49.810 --> 00:55:54.100
Because I'm thinking the more
and more companies we can see,

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.670
the fees are going to go down.

00:55:55.670 --> 00:55:58.420
So competition will
drive their fees down.

00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:00.400
They also have to
pay a fee to-- you'd

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:03.970
see they're a balance
sheet bank or in the case

00:56:03.970 --> 00:56:05.960
of securitization, too.

00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.960
GARY GENSLER: So you're
absolutely right.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:13.900
But financial intermediation
has multiple layers.

00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:17.860
And the more advanced
an economy is, usually

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:19.000
the more the layers.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.440
And the more competition in
the market, more the layers.

00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:26.830
And you might think of
layers as inefficiency.

00:56:26.830 --> 00:56:28.030
It might be.

00:56:28.030 --> 00:56:31.360
But often, layers would bring
efficiency and competition.

00:56:31.360 --> 00:56:35.650
So some financial firm
is doing the origination.

00:56:35.650 --> 00:56:39.760
This is brokering and selling
and providing a user interface.

00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:42.360
And they might not want to
be the balance sheet lender.

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:44.708
They might say, I'm going
to partner with the bank

00:56:44.708 --> 00:56:46.000
to be the balance sheet lender.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.730
What we're going to do is
we're going to compete and give

00:56:48.730 --> 00:56:52.840
the most remarkable, robust
user interface and brokerage.

00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:57.310
In the mortgage market, back to
that, the Quickens, and United

00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:00.470
Wholesale Mortgage, and
PennyMac that aren't on here,

00:57:00.470 --> 00:57:04.870
by and large, only hold the
mortgage for a few weeks,

00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:07.500
a few days, maybe
a couple months.

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.030
They have a warehouse
line of credit to do that.

00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:12.550
And then they
securitize the rest.

00:57:12.550 --> 00:57:14.080
But the mortgage
market in the US

00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.170
has a very robust
securitization market.

00:57:17.170 --> 00:57:18.980
You asked about credit cards.

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:23.830
Credit cards-- this 22%
that's competing with the rest

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:28.870
does not have as big a
robust securitization market.

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:31.330
Of the trillion
in the US, I think

00:57:31.330 --> 00:57:36.040
the credit card securitization
market is about $150 to $200

00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:38.410
billion if I recall.

00:57:38.410 --> 00:57:41.170
So it's harder.

00:57:41.170 --> 00:57:45.550
But it might be that company,
the Nubank, as Camillo asked,

00:57:45.550 --> 00:57:49.090
that has a better use of
underwriting, and data,

00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:51.520
and so forth.

00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.730
What somebody wouldn't give
for Credit Karma's data

00:57:54.730 --> 00:57:56.680
with 106 million files?

00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:59.020
That's a robust data set.

00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:02.120
Now, Intuit, we know,
paid $5 billion.

00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:06.160
So maybe we do know what
somebody would pay for it

00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:10.240
I wouldn't diminish being
at one particular slice.

00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:13.750
If you can find the
slice in the value chain

00:58:13.750 --> 00:58:17.260
and compete away some of
the incumbent's margin,

00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.385
credit cards are very big
business-- trillion dollars

00:58:21.385 --> 00:58:24.130
in the US, very big in
Europe and Asia as well,

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:27.220
growing in China rapidly.

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:29.440
And there's a lot of margin.

00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:31.813
I would say the thing
that's competing the most--

00:58:31.813 --> 00:58:32.980
and I'm going to jump ahead.

00:58:32.980 --> 00:58:35.800
But, Alexandro, stay
with us for a minute--

00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.710
is the personal loan business.

00:58:38.710 --> 00:58:42.730
Personal loans differ
from credit cards

00:58:42.730 --> 00:58:46.900
in an important way, is that
credit cards are what's known

00:58:46.900 --> 00:58:50.430
as a revolving line of credit.

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:53.430
Each purchase adds to
your credit balance.

00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:54.870
You have a limit.

00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:58.980
If you're high, if you're super
prime or a prime borrower,

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:00.030
your limit is higher.

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:03.010
If you're sub-prime,
your limit is lower.

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:07.500
That business of
revolving credit--

00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:10.200
about a trillion
dollars in the US.

00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:12.270
We now have this
personal loan business.

00:59:12.270 --> 00:59:15.540
It's only about one sixth
the size, about $160 billion

00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:17.340
in the US.

00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:19.620
That personal loan
business is generally

00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:23.670
term financing, a
specific term that you

00:59:23.670 --> 00:59:28.800
have to have an installment loan
and pay once every month for 36

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:33.610
months or for 48 or 60 months.

00:59:33.610 --> 00:59:35.890
The underwriting
risk of a term loan

00:59:35.890 --> 00:59:39.490
is lower than the underwriting
risk of credit card

00:59:39.490 --> 00:59:42.520
business or revolving credit.

00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:46.210
The personal loan business is
where most of the disruptors

00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:47.180
are.

00:59:47.180 --> 00:59:51.820
The SoFis, and the Prospers,
and the Nubanks, and so forth--

00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:56.090
they're trying to break
in the personal loan

00:59:56.090 --> 01:00:02.015
side as much or even more
than the credit card side.

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:02.890
But I don't know if--

01:00:02.890 --> 01:00:06.675
Alexandro, did you want
to follow up on anything?

01:00:06.675 --> 01:00:07.550
AUDIENCE: No, no, no.

01:00:07.550 --> 01:00:09.970
My point was just--

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:11.660
I don't know if you
agree on the fact

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:18.380
that we would see a
massive wave of mergers

01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:21.230
between these companies.

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:26.350
I mean, in my mind, there's
not much room for all

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:28.370
of these hundreds of
companies that are just

01:00:28.370 --> 01:00:30.783
popping up like mushrooms here.

01:00:30.783 --> 01:00:32.450
GARY GENSLER: I think
we'll see mergers.

01:00:32.450 --> 01:00:34.700
And I think we'll see failures.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:38.000
But the question is,
is there an opportunity

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.590
in the midst of all of that?

01:00:39.590 --> 01:00:43.360
Is there an opportunity
along the way?

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.920
We've seen in the payment
space a lot of consolidation

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:48.920
and the payment system
providers, the PSPs.

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.380
But there's still a
lot of opportunity

01:00:51.380 --> 01:00:54.440
for sector-specific
payment companies.

01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:58.010
And we've even seen that the
data aggregators in the payment

01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:03.260
space have started to
combine and be bought

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.020
where that phase of things.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:09.020
I think in the
household credit space,

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:11.870
we're going to see still
a lot of competition--

01:01:11.870 --> 01:01:13.107
personal loan.

01:01:13.107 --> 01:01:14.690
And I think in the
personal loan side,

01:01:14.690 --> 01:01:17.490
they will be chipping away
at some of the profit margin,

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:21.290
so will be trying to, at least,
of the incumbents in the credit

01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:22.340
card space.

01:01:22.340 --> 01:01:25.220
And interestingly in China,
the credit card space

01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.870
is trying to chip away at what
Alipay and WeChat Pay built up.

01:01:28.870 --> 01:01:34.100
Because there was a reverse
over there that's happened.

01:01:34.100 --> 01:01:36.770
Whether they'll be completely
successful-- another story.

01:01:39.267 --> 01:01:40.100
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:42.090
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:46.330
TA: [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:47.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sorry.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:50.200
So I have a question
on that point

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:55.750
that you brought up on UnionPay
being an attractive alternative

01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.325
to Alipay and WeChat Pay.

01:01:57.325 --> 01:01:59.150
GARY GENSLER:
[INAUDIBLE] I'm just

01:01:59.150 --> 01:02:02.560
going to say it's been growing
more quickly than I might

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:05.650
have thought, that
I wouldn't count out

01:02:05.650 --> 01:02:08.575
credit cards in China.

01:02:08.575 --> 01:02:09.450
They've been growing.

01:02:09.450 --> 01:02:11.825
AUDIENCE: Would you know what
were the value propositions

01:02:11.825 --> 01:02:15.660
of UnionPay that liked
their consumers to opt

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.456
to its UnionPay?

01:02:17.456 --> 01:02:18.092
Yeah.

01:02:18.092 --> 01:02:19.300
GARY GENSLER: Well, I'm not--

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.350
I mean, maybe some of our fellow
students know better than I.

01:02:23.350 --> 01:02:25.090
But I think, listen,
you can't count out

01:02:25.090 --> 01:02:27.610
that there's a distribution
channel when you have

01:02:27.610 --> 01:02:31.600
84 banks and particularly the
six or eight big banks in China

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.850
that own a piece [INAUDIBLE]
and all the hundreds of millions

01:02:36.850 --> 01:02:38.110
of people there.

01:02:38.110 --> 01:02:39.460
They're not asleep.

01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:43.630
As big tech comes in, the
incumbents don't rest.

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:45.370
It's competition.

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:48.580
But they do have the advantages
of incredible distribution

01:02:48.580 --> 01:02:53.440
channel, meaning the depositors
and clients of those banks.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.680
The product itself, the
revolving credit product,

01:02:56.680 --> 01:03:00.580
the classic credit
card product has

01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:03.520
a little bit more flexibility
than something just

01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.290
on an e-money wallet.

01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:08.170
And it doesn't mean
Alipay and WeChat Pay

01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:10.852
can't offer something that
is pretty much identical

01:03:10.852 --> 01:03:12.060
to a credit card [INAUDIBLE].

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.060
AUDIENCE: That's right.

01:03:13.060 --> 01:03:15.335
GARY GENSLER: But their
balances and the like

01:03:15.335 --> 01:03:16.960
might be different
as well, but I'm not

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.450
sufficiently close to it.

01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:20.580
AUDIENCE: OK, cool.

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:23.490
Thank you.

01:03:23.490 --> 01:03:26.950
GARY GENSLER: And I might
pull some data for next class.

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:30.010
I'll show you what I'm
talking about there.

01:03:30.010 --> 01:03:31.960
Personal loan business--
just to give you

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:35.530
a percentage of unsecured
personal loans, who is

01:03:35.530 --> 01:03:37.930
making unsecured personal loan?

01:03:37.930 --> 01:03:41.320
And again, a personal loan
is not tied to a credit card.

01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:44.000
It's usually an
installment or term loan.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:47.780
But you can see the shift
just in these five years,

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:51.740
that the disruptors are
eating into the market

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.735
share in this space.

01:03:53.735 --> 01:03:55.610
Here are some of the
personal loan companies.

01:03:55.610 --> 01:03:57.570
Not a lot of overlap.

01:03:57.570 --> 01:03:58.920
Prosper is on both lists.

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.250
But not a lot of
overlap with the list

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:03.700
to the small and medium size.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:06.410
And Camillo, I'm glad
I have NuBank on here.

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:08.090
But we'll come back
to a few of these

01:04:08.090 --> 01:04:09.800
when we talk about
challenger banks--

01:04:09.800 --> 01:04:12.740
Revolut, Nubank.

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:14.720
A number of these are
really what we also

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:17.780
call as challenger banks.

01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:21.170
Student loans-- I could probably
ask for a show of hands.

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:24.710
How many of you have a
student loan by one of these?

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:29.720
And in the US, the private
student loan market

01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:32.090
is only a small share.

01:04:32.090 --> 01:04:34.580
Student loans in
the US are dominated

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:37.340
by our Department of Education.

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:40.330
Over 92% of student
loans in America

01:04:40.330 --> 01:04:43.970
are either guaranteed or direct
loans from the Department

01:04:43.970 --> 01:04:45.140
of Education.

01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:47.210
But of course, the
private loan market

01:04:47.210 --> 01:04:50.090
where graduate students and
particularly those who are not

01:04:50.090 --> 01:04:52.850
US citizens are more likely
in the private student loan

01:04:52.850 --> 01:04:53.850
market.

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.190
These are probably familiar
names to many of you,

01:04:56.190 --> 01:05:01.220
whether you used MPower, or
Prodigy, or others, basically

01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:04.580
to shop for a student
loan or a traditional bank

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:08.410
like SunTrust and Wells Fargo.

01:05:08.410 --> 01:05:14.300
And that 8% of that market is
still about $100-plus billion.

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:19.440
Because the overall student
loan market is $1.6 trillion,

01:05:19.440 --> 01:05:22.290
so not small numbers.

01:05:22.290 --> 01:05:23.750
So marketplace lending--

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:26.450
I did say we would get to this.

01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:29.360
It's an online
platform connecting

01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.400
borrowers and investors.

01:05:31.400 --> 01:05:33.970
So it's a platform
in the middle,

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.980
started with this concept
of being peer to peer.

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.870
And so this is a
look at LendingClub

01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:42.090
from their own documents
from last summer.

01:05:42.090 --> 01:05:47.460
LendingClub-- 3 million-plus
borrowers on one side

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:52.110
of the platform economics,
200,000-plus investors

01:05:52.110 --> 01:05:53.050
on the other side.

01:05:53.050 --> 01:05:55.860
Now, don't think of it
as 3 million and 200,000,

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:58.960
because it gets more
concentrated than that.

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.230
But LendingClub
sits in the middle,

01:06:01.230 --> 01:06:04.770
between borrowers and
investors, or you might

01:06:04.770 --> 01:06:06.990
call lenders, but investors.

01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:10.448
But they partner
with issuing bank.

01:06:10.448 --> 01:06:12.990
They don't want to take a lot
of this on their balance sheet.

01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:15.770
They take some of it
onto their balance sheet.

01:06:15.770 --> 01:06:21.130
But they want to basically have
issuing bank partners plural,

01:06:21.130 --> 01:06:25.350
because they keep some
banks in competition.

01:06:25.350 --> 01:06:27.190
And so what LendingClub
is providing

01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:31.460
is the platform and some
of those issuing banks.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:33.050
They're not the
Bank of Americas,

01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:34.570
but they're much smaller banks.

01:06:34.570 --> 01:06:37.430
Say, all right, we don't
have that front end.

01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:39.770
We don't have that platform,
that user experience.

01:06:39.770 --> 01:06:43.470
LendingClub provides that.

01:06:43.470 --> 01:06:46.960
And the investors on the
other side of a LendingClub

01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:51.560
are often hedge funds.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:58.820
And asset managers are
saying we can invest.

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:03.230
LendingClub is providing
us a portfolio of loans.

01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:04.880
And you can see
the numbers here--

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:09.440
16-month average
duration, 1 and 1.6 to 7

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.360
and 1/2% range of returns.

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:14.480
That's a pretty wide
range of returns.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:15.410
And who are they?

01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:18.973
Managed accounts means it could
be an account at BlackRock

01:07:18.973 --> 01:07:20.390
or Fidelity that
says, we're going

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:23.030
to put a little bit of
money into this credit

01:07:23.030 --> 01:07:26.170
market and the like.

01:07:26.170 --> 01:07:27.230
Now, Luke was right.

01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:29.990
LendingClub and many of the
other marketplace lenders

01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:31.700
were quite a dream.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:33.620
LendingClub happened
to go public.

01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:37.640
And then their market
value came down quite a bit

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:40.610
as they had to prove out
whether they can make money.

01:07:40.610 --> 01:07:42.598
Where have they been
in these last 10 years,

01:07:42.598 --> 01:07:43.640
just to give you a sense?

01:07:43.640 --> 01:07:48.410
In 2010, only it was $100
million of originations.

01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:51.710
But it was all retail
originations, by and large.

01:07:51.710 --> 01:07:57.990
By 2018, the retail, which
is a very small part of it--

01:07:57.990 --> 01:08:01.400
they're originating very--
quite a different bit

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.960
of loans, how they're
originating these things.

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.910
And China-- I just
want to mention

01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:13.550
China went through a remarkable
wave of peer-to-peer lending.

01:08:13.550 --> 01:08:15.140
And then the People's
Bank of China

01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:18.410
felt, no, we've got to
get control of this.

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:24.970
I mean, literally there was
2,700 peer-to-peer lending

01:08:24.970 --> 01:08:28.420
platforms in China
just 4 years ago

01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:33.069
and most recent statistics
down to about 300-plus.

01:08:33.069 --> 01:08:37.990
And in November of 2019,
the official sector in China

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:40.899
still said this isn't right.

01:08:40.899 --> 01:08:43.720
The peer-to-peer lenders
need more regulation.

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:47.229
In essence, they need
bank-like regulation.

01:08:47.229 --> 01:08:50.109
And what's interesting
is back to LendingClub,

01:08:50.109 --> 01:08:51.819
LendingClub has
actually announced

01:08:51.819 --> 01:08:55.029
the purchase of a bank.

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:57.609
Romain, I think I
saw a hand go up.

01:09:00.257 --> 01:09:01.340
TA: I don't see any, Gary.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.760
GARY GENSLER: Oh, OK.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:07.100
But there were questions
earlier about LendingClub.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:07.600
TA: Yeah.

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:09.430
So now, we have
two hands raised.

01:09:09.430 --> 01:09:12.439
Let's go first with Jose.

01:09:12.439 --> 01:09:15.240
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I'm not
super familiar with LendingClub,

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:18.090
but I'm familiar with
another one in Europe.

01:09:18.090 --> 01:09:20.720
I think the way it works
is a bit different.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.516
I would like to hear your
opinion on that model.

01:09:23.516 --> 01:09:25.850
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:25.850 --> 01:09:27.132
AUDIENCE: Sorry?

01:09:27.132 --> 01:09:28.299
GARY GENSLER: I'm listening.

01:09:28.299 --> 01:09:28.799
Yes.

01:09:28.799 --> 01:09:30.265
AUDIENCE: So it's called Mintos.

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:31.890
I think it's the
biggest one in Europe.

01:09:31.890 --> 01:09:33.473
And basically, what
they do is there's

01:09:33.473 --> 01:09:36.920
a group of loan originators that
are independent companies that

01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.290
create these loans and
give out these loans.

01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:45.740
And then these [AUDIO OUT]
[INAUDIBLE] loans

01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:46.970
to independent investors.

01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:49.950
But they guarantee the
payment of the loan.

01:09:49.950 --> 01:09:54.440
So if the person that asked
for the loan doesn't pay,

01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:00.990
the loan originator pays for
that payment to the investor.

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:03.110
So basically, the
risk for the investor

01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:06.035
is that the loan
originators go bankrupt.

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:09.862
I learned there's something
similar in the US to that.

01:10:09.862 --> 01:10:11.570
GARY GENSLER: Well,
so what you're saying

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:15.560
is how they are
managing the risks.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.440
The investors are
taking a credit risk

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:25.380
on the platform, the
originator, rather

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.950
than taking a credit risk on the
portfolio of loans themselves.

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:34.327
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

01:10:34.327 --> 01:10:35.910
AUDIENCE: --one more
layer in between.

01:10:35.910 --> 01:10:37.290
So there's the loan originators.

01:10:37.290 --> 01:10:39.360
And there's hundreds
of companies, then

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.340
the platform that
connects the loan

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:43.890
originators with investors.

01:10:43.890 --> 01:10:48.270
And basically, the investors
invest in specific loans,

01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:50.872
but they are guaranteed
by the loan originators.

01:10:50.872 --> 01:10:52.330
GARY GENSLER: Why
don't we do this?

01:10:52.330 --> 01:10:54.580
Why don't you shoot me an email?

01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:56.920
And I'll try to take this
up in our next class.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.620
And I'll look at the
company more specifically.

01:10:59.620 --> 01:11:03.960
But to the point,
there's no reason

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:10.470
you can't find a new model as
to who takes the credit risk.

01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:13.740
Credit risk is
inherent in lending.

01:11:13.740 --> 01:11:16.860
Somebody is going
to repay on time.

01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:19.980
And others are going to fall
into delinquency or even

01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.400
default. And so
then the structure

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.320
of a market, whether
it's mortgages,

01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:30.270
credit cards, personal
loans, small businesses--

01:11:30.270 --> 01:11:34.470
the structure of a
market might evolve

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:39.360
as to how to slice up who
bears that credit risk.

01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.740
And there's not
just credit risk.

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:42.130
There's prepayment risk.

01:11:42.130 --> 01:11:44.040
There's interest rate risk.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.500
There's numerous
financial risks.

01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.510
And so what's just being
highlighted by Jose--

01:11:48.510 --> 01:11:49.590
and I apologize.

01:11:49.590 --> 01:11:54.030
I just don't know that model,
is that the investors, rather

01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:58.470
than bearing the direct
credit risk of the borrowers

01:11:58.470 --> 01:12:01.590
are having some of
that held by others.

01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:04.470
And they're bearing the
risk of the intermediary

01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:07.260
in between the platform.

01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.860
And in essence, that's
true in the US mortgage

01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.030
market, a very different
part, what you asked about.

01:12:14.030 --> 01:12:17.550
But the US mortgage
market conforming loans

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:23.790
are guaranteed by the government
or by the government-sponsored

01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:26.280
enterprises so that
your risks then

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.120
are a little bit different.

01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.460
It's not the credit risk.

01:12:29.460 --> 01:12:32.610
In the US mortgage market,
you have prepayment risk.

01:12:32.610 --> 01:12:36.060
Will somebody pay
the mortgage early

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:39.040
as interest rates might
go down and so forth?

01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.150
And then in parts of the
US mortgage market that

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:44.550
are not the conforming
mortgage market,

01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:45.810
you did have credit risk.

01:12:45.810 --> 01:12:48.070
Because the government
wasn't guaranteeing.

01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:49.950
And a lot of the
sub-prime mortgage

01:12:49.950 --> 01:12:53.253
mess that we got into
in 2008 was around that.

01:12:53.253 --> 01:12:55.170
But rather than taking
time now, why don't you

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:56.420
shoot me an email?

01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:00.370
I'll look at this specific
company and come back.

01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:02.400
Romain, were there
other hands up?

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.955
TA: Yes, let's go with Akshay.

01:13:04.955 --> 01:13:06.080
AUDIENCE: Hello, professor.

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:10.040
So I had no question with the
business model of LendingClub.

01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:14.820
So what is the role of
issuing banks in this case?

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:18.470
GARY GENSLER: So issuing
banks basically are

01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:21.450
lending their balance sheet.

01:13:21.450 --> 01:13:25.880
So let's say an issuing bank
has its own availability

01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:32.280
of depositors and has not built
the front end to the borrowers.

01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.360
So the issuing bank is
standing in to do that.

01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:41.210
In addition, they're actually
papering and documenting

01:13:41.210 --> 01:13:42.440
the loans.

01:13:42.440 --> 01:13:44.360
So as you see on
this chart here,

01:13:44.360 --> 01:13:51.500
the issuing bank is sending
the loans out and taking it in.

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:54.890
So there's a regulatory reason
that the issuing bank is there.

01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:59.210
So the issuing bank might
issue the loans and hold them.

01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:01.490
Or the issuing bank
might issue the loans

01:14:01.490 --> 01:14:03.960
and then, literally,
as this chart shows,

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:05.600
resell them to LendingClub.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:08.970
And LendingClub sells
them to investors.

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:13.240
So there's a bit of--

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.810
it's similar to what's
called a warehouse line.

01:14:16.810 --> 01:14:18.640
The issuing bank
is standing there

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:23.830
ready to take loans,
but then resell them.

01:14:23.830 --> 01:14:27.430
Because their capability
is only a certain size.

01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:30.580
LendingClub says they
did $10 billion of loans

01:14:30.580 --> 01:14:33.250
in 2018, if I recall the number.

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.370
The issuing bank doesn't
want to put $10 billion on.

01:14:36.370 --> 01:14:38.320
But they're providing
the liquidity

01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:43.270
for the first few days or weeks
until LendingClub then provides

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:45.880
the investor to buy the loan.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:49.030
So it's similar to
a warehouse line,

01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:52.600
but it's actually a
purchase and sale.

01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.890
They purchase the loan or
issue the loan and sell.

01:14:56.890 --> 01:14:59.530
There's also a bit of
regulation that you actually

01:14:59.530 --> 01:15:01.520
have a bank involved.

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:06.220
And part of what was going
on, both in the UK and the US,

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:09.220
is this marketplace.

01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:11.770
Peer-to-peer lending
started, is the platforms

01:15:11.770 --> 01:15:14.470
didn't want to,
frankly, register

01:15:14.470 --> 01:15:16.660
and be regulated like banks.

01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.180
They needed somebody
else to make the loan

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:22.208
to have that interface.

01:15:22.208 --> 01:15:23.690
I oversimplified.

01:15:23.690 --> 01:15:26.340
And probably a lawyer would tell
me I've gotten it a little bit

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:27.860
wrong.

01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:30.660
TA: And then we have Adam
who would like to provide

01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.985
some insight on UnionPay.

01:15:32.985 --> 01:15:33.860
GARY GENSLER: Please.

01:15:33.860 --> 01:15:34.360
Please.

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:36.880
And then [INAUDIBLE]
closed on alternative data.

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:37.512
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:15:37.512 --> 01:15:39.470
In response to [INAUDIBLE]'s's
earlier question

01:15:39.470 --> 01:15:44.180
about UnionPay, so UnionPay is
a state-owned credit and debit

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.770
card network, all right?

01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:51.440
So the one thing that separates
them from the [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:53.540
duopoly between
Alipay and WeChat Pay,

01:15:53.540 --> 01:15:56.900
which dominates 90% of the
market, is that it can be,

01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:58.850
well, among other things.

01:15:58.850 --> 01:16:02.240
They can be used for all mobile
devices and computer browsers.

01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:05.210
So technology wise, they
do have an advantage.

01:16:05.210 --> 01:16:08.390
Because for WeChat
Pay, it's quite

01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:11.300
restrictive in
terms of technology,

01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:13.490
because they're used
mostly on mobile.

01:16:13.490 --> 01:16:15.890
And unlike Alipay
and WeChat Pay,

01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:19.580
UnionPay actually supports
almost all currencies

01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:22.430
and operates in many
countries besides China,

01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:24.740
also a feature that
both Alipay and WeChat

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:29.150
Pay are struggling with,
due to the peculiarities

01:16:29.150 --> 01:16:31.820
of the Chinese legislation.

01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:36.860
And the one thing is that
what UnionPay focuses on

01:16:36.860 --> 01:16:41.060
is the fact that they
focus on the efforts

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:42.590
of those Chinese
account holders.

01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:44.810
Because most people--
in fact, the majority

01:16:44.810 --> 01:16:48.870
of the people who owns a credit
card will be UnionPay holders.

01:16:48.870 --> 01:16:51.980
They are focusing on people who
travel abroad, predominantly

01:16:51.980 --> 01:16:53.750
to the US, in fact.

01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:57.290
So you see a lot
of shops that are

01:16:57.290 --> 01:17:00.080
targeting for Chinese
customers and travelers.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.150
You would see that UnionPay.

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:03.710
They could actually
pay by UnionPay.

01:17:03.710 --> 01:17:07.340
So these are the edge that they
have over Alipay and WeChat

01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:07.840
Pay.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.965
And that's just in response
to the earlier question

01:17:09.965 --> 01:17:11.358
[INAUDIBLE].

01:17:11.358 --> 01:17:12.150
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.390
What I'm going to do is--
because we only have two

01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:17.300
minutes, is I'm going to hold
off and talk about alternative

01:17:17.300 --> 01:17:22.560
data when we start up our next
session on challenger banks

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:29.570
and the like and just close
out with a little comment,

01:17:29.570 --> 01:17:35.330
if I might, on just to--

01:17:35.330 --> 01:17:38.490
what I've already said in our
first class on professionalism.

01:17:38.490 --> 01:17:39.980
Hope this slide is there.

01:17:39.980 --> 01:17:49.750
But again, is that I just
want to lend to you again

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:52.510
from my years of experience.

01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:56.600
We're in a very unusual time
now with the corona crisis.

01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.810
And we're even at MIT.

01:17:58.810 --> 01:18:05.140
It's these Zoom classes and pass
emergency, no credit emergency,

01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:06.280
and the like.

01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:09.160
But I would just share with
you my own observation,

01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:12.490
that for those of you trying
to get the most out of this MIT

01:18:12.490 --> 01:18:14.425
experience, it's not easy.

01:18:14.425 --> 01:18:18.520
And in some ways, it's just
frustrating as heck, I'm sure.

01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:20.140
But again, to the
extent that you

01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.990
can, to the extent you
can come prepared, and be

01:18:22.990 --> 01:18:27.160
curious, and reach out to
faculty members like myself,

01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:30.520
and leverage off of our
experience, take office hours,

01:18:30.520 --> 01:18:31.330
I would do it.

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:33.880
I know this is a lousy time.

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:34.590
A lousy time.

01:18:34.590 --> 01:18:37.270
I'm just reminding
us all of that

01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:41.750
and saying take whatever you
can out of this MIT experience,

01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:45.160
even if it's
diminished in some way.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:48.370
I want to make myself
available again.

01:18:48.370 --> 01:18:51.800
If you find the readings
of interest, do them.

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:54.850
If you can't get through them
because you're distracted

01:18:54.850 --> 01:18:56.980
and you're looking
for a job, I get that.

01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:57.580
I get that.

01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.950
I'm just saying the
more you engage,

01:18:59.950 --> 01:19:03.760
the more you will invest in
yourselves and get out of it.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:06.160
And on plagiarism--
and I say this just

01:19:06.160 --> 01:19:09.130
to remind people again.

01:19:09.130 --> 01:19:11.880
There's probably-- it's going
to be hard for any of you--

01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.650
get no credit emergency.

01:19:13.650 --> 01:19:17.190
But somebody might get no
credit emergency if you submit

01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:21.720
a 1,000-word paper and 600
or 800 words are plagiarized.

01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:27.330
That's your pathway right
into that no credit emergency.

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:29.270
It's easy to avoid,
because you know

01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:32.180
if you're taking a lot
from something else.

01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.990
And I just say this, because
I have had those experiences.

01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:37.790
I just mention it
again, just because I

01:19:37.790 --> 01:19:42.050
want to do you the favor of
helping you make sure that even

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:45.770
in these unusual times,
that you protect yourself

01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:50.960
if you want to get these 9
credits on your transcript.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:55.040
But mostly, I put this up again
at this part of the semester,

01:19:55.040 --> 01:20:00.000
just to say, we want to make
this MIT experience as good,

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:02.280
given all the
challenges as we can.

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:07.530
And we know it's a
heck of a crazy time.

01:20:07.530 --> 01:20:12.120
But to the extent you want
me off hours or another time

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:14.740
or you've got questions that
I'll further research, just let

01:20:14.740 --> 01:20:15.240
me know.

01:20:15.240 --> 01:20:17.623
Or if you have a fintech
startup, let me know.

01:20:17.623 --> 01:20:18.540
And I'll be all there.

01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:19.860
And I'll read that, too.

01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:21.490
I had one student
recently send me

01:20:21.490 --> 01:20:25.680
a whole paper on a fintech
startup, just outside of this.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.730
It's not an assignment.

01:20:26.730 --> 01:20:28.440
But they're engaged
in a startup.

01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.765
And I'm going to review
it and give some feedback.

[CLICKING]

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:12.420
SCOTT HUGHES: So
we're switching gears.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.440
We're done with the large scale
structure of the universe.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.079
Now we're done with cosmology.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.480
And I'm going to move
into the topic that

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:25.110
will dominate the last
several lectures of 8.962.

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.730
Let's look at how to
construct the spacetime

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.310
of a compact body.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.290
In particular, we're
going to start by focusing

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.560
on a compact spherical body.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.210
What I mean by compact-- so
spherical, I hope, is clear--

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.030
but what I mean by compact
is that the body occupies

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.830
a finite spatial region.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.340
And it has a surface with
an exterior that is vacuum.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.880
So what I'm going
to do is design

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.110
some kind of a spacetime.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.170
I'm imagining that
there is a source that

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.580
fills some compact region.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.430
I'm going to make it
strictly symmetric.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.370
And the exterior of the source
will be t mu nu equals 0.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330
So if you think about
this, this is telling you

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.970
that if it's
spherically symmetric,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.150
your metric can only
depend on radius.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.840
And so the most
general form, at least

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.210
for a static spherically
symmetric spacetime--

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.100
we'll talk a little
bit about a few things

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.190
related to non-static
situations a little bit later.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.140
So the most general static
form of a spherically symmetric

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:12.410
compact body tells me
that I can write my metric

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.930
as some function of r, which
for reasons of convenience

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:23.220
I will write that is e
to the 2 phi, t squared.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.780
Some other function
of r, dr squared.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.330
And then some function of
r times my angular sector.

00:02:41.758 --> 00:02:43.550
You might wonder why
there's no cross-term.

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.383
In particular, why can't
I have a cross-term

00:02:45.383 --> 00:02:47.990
between my dt and my dr?

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.325
I have a few lines
on this in my notes.

00:02:50.325 --> 00:02:51.950
I won't go through
them in detail here,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.300
but I'll just describe.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.070
Basically, what you
find is that if there

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.980
is a cross-term between,
say, the t and the r pieces,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.100
you can get rid of it by a
coordinate transformation.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.230
This way of doing
things so that it

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.530
is diagonal amounts to choosing
a good time coordinate.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.730
We can simplify
the angular sector

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.419
by choosing a good
radial coordinate.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.590
The word "good" is a
little bit loaded here.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.490
I'm going to
actually in a moment

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.980
describe a slightly different
choice of radial coordinate,

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.350
which is also good, but
for different purposes.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.500
The one I'm going
to use is one where

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.710
this function that gives
length to the angular sector

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.780
is just r squared.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:52.490
What this means is
that the coordinate r,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:04:01.990
it labels nested
spheres that have

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:09.350
surface area 4 pi r squared.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.950
So if you imagine
that in this spacetime

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.899
you make a series of
spheres, and each one of them

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:22.120
has an area 4 pi r squared, that
is the r that goes into this.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.090
Bear in mind-- [CLEARING THROAT]
excuse me-- bear in mind,

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.590
that does not mean--

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.050
let's say I've got one sphere
of radius 4 pi r1 squared,

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.390
and then outside of it a sphere
of radius 4 pi r2 squared.

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:40.180
That does not mean that the
distance, the proper distance,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.790
between those two
spheres is r2 minus r1.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.230
So this is unlikely to measure--

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:01.070
to label radial
distance cleanly.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:02.530
In fact, it would
only be the case

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:05.600
that this cleanly labels
radial distance if the function

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.780
lambda were equal to 0.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.190
And as we'll see, that's
generally not the case.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.453
So whenever we do things
in a curved spacetime,

00:05:13.453 --> 00:05:15.620
things are always going to
get a little bit messier.

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.300
And what's nice about
this is at least

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.620
we do have a clean geometric
meaning to the coordinate r.

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.410
In fact, before I
move on, this is

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:33.680
called an areal radius, a radius
simply related to surface area.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.320
So in the end, the
spacetime that I

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:57.540
will be working with in this
lecture takes this form.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.590
And so this is a
choice that is known

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.016
as Schwarzschild coordinates.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:27.610
We will come back to the name
Schwarzschild before too long.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.160
As I said, so this is a
particularly good choice

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.150
of radial coordinate.

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:33.080
It'll be very convenient
for what we do.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.250
It's not the only one.

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:38.350
Other coordinate
choices are possible.

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:40.450
And another one that is
quite useful for us--

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:46.670
we're not going to use it
too much in this lecture--

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.723
is what are called
isotropic coordinates.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:57.270
So this is a coordinate
system in which

00:06:57.270 --> 00:07:17.770
you choose a radial coordinate
which I will call r bar,

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.900
such that your line
element looks like this.

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:21.790
What this does is
this emphasizes

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:25.600
the fact that we are working
in a coordinate system--

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.800
or excuse me-- we're working
in a spacetime in which all

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.970
of your spatial slices are
fundamentally isotropic.

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:38.065
So get far enough away from
this thing, and the three--

00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:39.940
it's just emphasizing
the fact that the three

00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:41.380
spatial directions are--

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:42.880
there is something
special about it.

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.660
There's presumably a body at r
bar equals 0, in its vicinity,

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.520
but other than that,
there's nothing

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.448
particularly special about--

00:07:50.448 --> 00:07:52.240
if I go into a little
freely falling frame,

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.698
all three directions
look the same.

00:07:53.698 --> 00:07:55.330
This helps emphasize this.

00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:58.990
We lose the areal
interpretation of r here.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:07.500
I'll remind you that our weak
field solution that we derived

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:14.100
a few weeks ago, a few
lectures ago rather,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:15.120
it looked like this.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.380
And voila, look at that.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.630
It's exactly the same form.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.100
So this is, in fact--
when we derive this,

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.780
this is, in fact, actually
in isotropic coordinates.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.280
What we found was that
the mu that appears here

00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:53.810
is equal to minus phi with
phi itself being very small.

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:57.950
And the phi that
came from this is

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:01.370
Newton's gravitational--
the Newtonion gravitational

00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.232
potential.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.780
Let's switch back.

00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:10.040
We're going to use
Schwarzschild coordinates.

00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.870
This is kind of an aside.

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.480
We will use Schwarzschild
shield coordinates

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.007
for the bulk of our lecture.

00:09:16.007 --> 00:09:17.840
Actually, the last thing
I'll say about this

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.430
is that there is a problem.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.930
There's a problem
on a problem set--

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:25.350
I might have made it optional.

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:27.500
I don't quite recall--

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:30.770
in which for one of the
spacetimes that you're

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:35.390
going to be working with
in about two more lectures,

00:09:35.390 --> 00:09:37.730
you convert between
Schwarzschild coordinates

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.050
and isotropic coordinates.

00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:41.640
I think it's an optional lec--

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.270
it's an optional
problem at this point.

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.420
But it's worth looking at.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.550
So let's build a bot.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:53.640
Let's build the spacetime
of a compact spherical body.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:05.220
What we need are curvature
tensors and matter terms.

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.060
The curvature tensors,
since I've given you--

00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.560
whoops.

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.280
Not there.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:18.400
No.

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:19.000
The one at the top.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:19.660
I'm sorry.

00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.670
Since I've given
you ds squared, you

00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:24.140
know all the metric elements.

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:26.380
It's then just a
matter of a little bit

00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.130
of having the algebraic
stamina to run through and do

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:31.420
the calculations.

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.830
It's straightforward
to construct

00:10:32.830 --> 00:10:36.400
all of the curvature
tensor components.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.720
The GR tool Mathematica
notebook that

00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.360
will soon be released
on the 8.962 website,

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.160
if it has not been
released already,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.188
that will allow you to do this.

00:10:48.188 --> 00:10:50.230
I'm going to just sort of
quote the results, what

00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:51.355
the results turn out to be.

00:10:51.355 --> 00:10:54.070
So for this spacetime, it's
given in Carroll's textbook,

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:57.280
a slightly different
notation, but you can easily

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.820
translate from the functions
Carroll uses to the ones

00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.193
that I've written here.

00:11:02.193 --> 00:11:04.360
So we need to get those
curvature tensor components.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.110
And we need matter.

00:11:06.110 --> 00:11:08.410
And so we will do
what we generally

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.090
always do in this class.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:15.160
We will treat our body as
being made of a perfect fluid.

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:22.300
So let's write out our curvature
tensors that arise from this.

00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:24.970
I'm going to go straight
to the Ricci tensor.

00:11:30.450 --> 00:11:33.270
If you want to work out all
the complements to the Riemann

00:11:33.270 --> 00:11:35.580
tensor, knock yourself out.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:39.057
As I said, they are
listed in Carroll's book.

00:11:39.057 --> 00:11:41.640
It's not terribly difficult to
go and work all these guys out,

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.790
though.

00:11:43.790 --> 00:11:45.560
Certainly not using Mathematica.

00:12:06.390 --> 00:12:11.820
So here's what you get for the
rr complement of the Ricci.

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.920
Notice we are seeing
nonlinear terms in here.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.030
These are the kind of terms
that in all of our calculations,

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.780
when we were looking at bodies
in a weak field spacetime,

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:22.740
we set those to 0.

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:01.460
So the form for the ttp.

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:05.120
So notice it's quite similar
to the form for rrp's.

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.280
If you saw me hesitate
while I was writing,

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:09.470
I actually suddenly just
got concerned I was writing

00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:12.230
the wrong line down,
and was just verifying

00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:14.210
that I was writing
the right thing.

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:22.360
And two more non-trivial
complements, or really

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:24.660
one more non-trivial
component, and then there's

00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.670
a fourth component
that is simply related.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.590
So here is our Ricci tensor.

00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:57.820
We're going to solve it for
a perfect fluid stress energy

00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:58.320
tensor.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:00.510
We will also solve it for--

00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:02.940
sorry-- we will use this
to make an Einstein tensor,

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.280
equate it to a perfect
fluid stress energy tensor,

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.650
and use that to
build the spacetime

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:10.050
on the interior of this object.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.600
The exterior of the object is
going to be treated as vacuum.

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.502
That will have 0
stress energy tensor.

00:14:14.502 --> 00:14:15.960
And so it'll be a
little bit easier

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.030
when we construct the
exterior solution just

00:14:18.030 --> 00:14:21.270
to set Ricci equal
to 0 and solve it.

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:23.940
Before I get into that,
let's look at the source

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.790
we're going to use to describe
this compact spherical body.

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.410
Like I said, we're
going to treat this guy

00:14:31.410 --> 00:14:35.770
as a perfect fluid
stress energy.

00:14:35.770 --> 00:14:38.073
So by now, you will
have seen me written--

00:14:38.073 --> 00:14:39.490
you'll have seen
that I've written

00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:41.350
this form down multiple times.

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.490
So these, the pressure
and the density,

00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:00.500
are both functions
only of radius,

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.410
since this is
spherically symmetric.

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:09.780
And u denotes the four-velocity
of fluid elements in this

00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:10.280
fluid--

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.362
in this body.

00:15:12.362 --> 00:15:14.195
I'm going to start
calling this body a star.

00:15:16.612 --> 00:15:18.320
It doesn't necessarily
have to be a star,

00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.240
but it's just a
convenient shorthand.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:24.440
So I want this star's
fluid to be static.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:35.260
So the four-velocity will
have a timeline component,

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.230
but there is no spatial motion.

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.900
I want the star's fluid
to be at spatial rest.

00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:47.160
I am going to require that
this be properly normalized.

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:49.380
u dot u equals minus 1.

00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:52.680
So if I do that
in this spacetime,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.770
I'm led to the requirement
that u upstairs

00:15:56.770 --> 00:16:00.150
t is e to the phi of r.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:03.590
Pardon me.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:05.720
e to the minus 5r.

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:10.250
And u downstairs t
is minus e to the 5r.

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:20.800
Finally, we're going to assume--

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.450
so as I said, we're going to
treat this as a compact body.

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.830
So we're going to require
that it have a surface.

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:34.730
So we will assume rho
of r equals 0, p of r

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:40.520
equals 0 for r greater
than or equal to r star.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.340
r star denotes the
surface of this body.

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.490
Let's attack.

00:16:53.490 --> 00:16:58.210
So it's a little bit easiest
to do the exterior first.

00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:08.560
So we're going to consider
the region outside of r star.

00:17:11.569 --> 00:17:13.819
t mu nu equals 0 there.

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:23.170
And so my Einstein equations
become Ricci equals 0.

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:26.380
So I can just take every
one of these things,

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:31.510
set them equal to 0, and
try to assemble solutions

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.670
for phi and for lambda.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.640
Now a particularly convenient--

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.618
every one of these
things has to equal 0

00:17:38.618 --> 00:17:40.660
so I can make various
linear combinations of them

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.160
to make things that
are particularly

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.560
convenient to work with.

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:50.140
And if you sort of stare at
the tt and the rr equations,

00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:55.600
one thing you see is that
if you multiply the tt

00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:59.100
by this combination
of metric functions,

00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:06.170
add the r r, what that does
is it allows you to cancel out

00:18:06.170 --> 00:18:07.520
those nonlinear terms.

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:15.210
And this combination
tells you that--

00:18:20.578 --> 00:18:23.370
whoops-- this
combination tells you

00:18:23.370 --> 00:18:28.930
that it's an overall
factor of 2/r,

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:31.540
the radial derivative of phi
equals the radial derivative

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.430
of lambda.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:37.960
And so this tells me that
at least in the exterior phi

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:41.440
equals minus lambda,
perhaps up to some constant

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:44.350
of integration.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:51.300
If we go when we plug this into
our metric, what that k does

00:18:51.300 --> 00:18:54.150
is it just gives me a
rescaling, depending upon

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.130
whether I want to attach
it to the function phi

00:18:56.130 --> 00:18:59.400
or attach it to the
function lambda.

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.600
What we see is that K
just essentially rescales.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:04.845
But let's do the following.

00:19:04.845 --> 00:19:06.720
Let's sort of say that
I'm going to plug this

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.470
in and say that I'm going
to plug it in for phi.

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:26.600
So if I plug this
into the metric,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:31.310
I can capture the impact of the
constant of integration k here

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.564
by just rescaling
my time coordinate.

00:19:36.255 --> 00:19:37.880
So we are free just
to say, OK, there's

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.922
no physics in this thing.

00:19:38.922 --> 00:19:40.220
So let's just set k equals 0.

00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:47.920
So that's already great.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.860
We have found that at
least in the exterior

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.020
phi is equal to minus lambda.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:56.170
We've reduced this metric
from having two free functions

00:19:56.170 --> 00:19:58.570
to one.

00:19:58.570 --> 00:20:01.390
So we're feeling spunky now.

00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:05.500
Let's take a look at a couple
more of these equations,

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.000
and see what we can
learn from them.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:24.120
So we still have some of
these ugly things involving

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.210
nonlinear stuff in
the rr and the tt,

00:20:27.210 --> 00:20:32.180
but it's all linear in
the theta theta equation.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:40.380
So let's look at r
theta theta equals 0.

00:20:40.380 --> 00:20:45.890
So I have e to the
minus 2 lambda r

00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:54.810
dr of lambda minus r dr
of phi minus 1 plus 1.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:56.820
All this equals 0.

00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.250
So now you can either substitute
for lambda or substitute

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:00.750
for phi.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:03.720
I'm going to follow my
notes here and substitute

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.500
in lambda equals minus phi.

00:21:22.010 --> 00:21:24.290
Stare at this for a
second, and you'll

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:28.190
realize that you can rewrite
this term on the left-hand side

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:40.260
as dr of r e to
the 2 phi equals 1.

00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:44.130
And this can be
easily integrated up.

00:21:44.130 --> 00:21:50.100
And the solution is
phi of r equals 1/2

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:57.980
log 1 plus a/r, where a is
some constant of integration.

00:22:06.197 --> 00:22:07.780
We're going to figure
out a way to fix

00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:09.980
that constant of integration.

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.220
And you can probably guess
how I'm going to do that.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.290
But let's just hold
that thought for now.

00:22:14.290 --> 00:22:17.230
So let's just take this
solution and write down

00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:19.390
what our exterior
spacetime looks like.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:34.100
So plugging this guy in, I get--

00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:49.722
OK.

00:22:49.722 --> 00:22:52.537
So here's my line element.

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:54.120
And we're going to
do the usual thing.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:56.940
This is-- well, remember
that this situation describes

00:22:56.940 --> 00:22:58.290
gravity.

00:22:58.290 --> 00:23:01.290
And gravity has a
Newtonian limit,

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:06.270
which these general relativistic
solutions must capture.

00:23:06.270 --> 00:23:12.160
So let's make sure that this
captures my weak field limit.

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:19.180
So let's consider r
gihugically greater than a.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:21.675
a must be some parameter with
the dimensions of length.

00:23:24.725 --> 00:23:26.100
It might turn out
to be negative.

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.860
So let's take the absolute
value of this thing.

00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.100
And let's consider a
purely radial freefall.

00:23:41.850 --> 00:23:44.350
So I'm going to imagine--

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.070
when I work this
guy out, I'm going

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:52.730
to look at geodesics
in this limit.

00:24:04.395 --> 00:24:06.950
I'm going to look at
purely radial freefall.

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.445
I'm going to consider the
non-relativistic large r limit.

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:30.410
So here I am imagining in
my non-relativistic limit

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:34.870
that dt d tau is much
greater than the dr d tau.

00:24:34.870 --> 00:24:38.140
So when you work out all those
components of the Ricci tensor,

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:40.780
you will have computed all
of the Christoffel symbols.

00:24:45.650 --> 00:24:47.770
And you go back to your
handy dandy little table

00:24:47.770 --> 00:24:49.603
of these things that
you will have computed.

00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:58.300
So here's what you get for that.

00:25:05.690 --> 00:25:08.830
Your phi is given by
1/2 log of 1 plus a/r.

00:25:20.130 --> 00:25:32.490
So-- taking the exponential
and the proper derivatives,

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:41.530
what this tells you is
that this is negative

00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:49.258
a over 2r squared 1 plus a/r.

00:25:49.258 --> 00:25:51.550
And again, I'll emphasize,
we are considering this sort

00:25:51.550 --> 00:25:54.640
of very large r limit.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:26:01.210
So this is approximately
negative a over 2r squared.

00:26:01.210 --> 00:26:06.760
Dividing both sides by the
factor of dt d tau squared,

00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.800
I finally get my
equation of motion

00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:12.690
for non-relativistic weak
field radial freefall

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:19.800
to be that this thing's
radial acceleration is a over

00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:21.268
2r squared.

00:26:21.268 --> 00:26:23.310
Now, we want this to
capture the Newtonian limit.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:37.250
Newtonian freefall
is given by dt dr

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:40.640
equals the gravitational
acceleration

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.710
minus gm over r squared.

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:44.510
They're exactly
the same, provided

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:47.975
I select a equals minus 2gm.

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:58.510
So what emerges out
of this analysis

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:03.385
is this truly lovely solution.

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:20.640
This is known as the
Schwarzschild metric.

00:27:38.948 --> 00:27:40.740
This is a good point
to tell a brief story.

00:27:43.350 --> 00:27:47.100
Carl Schwarzschild
derived this solution

00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:51.750
shortly after the publication
of Einstein's field equation.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:55.440
So Einstein's field equations
appeared in late November--

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.510
excuse me-- late
in the year 1915.

00:27:57.510 --> 00:28:00.000
I believe in November
of 1915, but we

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.870
should double-check that.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:06.120
Schwarzschild published
this exact solution,

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.500
a few months later, I
believe in early 1916.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.510
Students of history
will note that if you

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:17.170
were in Germany
in 1915 and 1916,

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:20.440
you were likely to be
involved in some rather

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:24.670
all encompassing, non-academic
activities at that time.

00:28:24.670 --> 00:28:27.520
And in fact, Carl Schwarzschild
did this calculation

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:29.260
while he was serving
as an artillery

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.200
officer in the German Army
on the Western-- excuse me--

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:35.610
on the Eastern Front.

00:28:35.610 --> 00:28:40.535
He, in fact, was quite ill
at the time he did this.

00:28:40.535 --> 00:28:41.910
I believe it was
a lung infection

00:28:41.910 --> 00:28:45.390
that he had accumulated while
serving in the trenches.

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:49.630
And so while recuperating
from this disease,

00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:52.470
he received
Einstein's manuscripts

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.230
because he was a professor
in his civilian life,

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.480
and just wanted to keep
up with the literature.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.800
He was inspired by this
relativistic theory of gravity,

00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:04.920
and decided that it would be
worth a little bit of his time

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:07.252
while he was resting
in the hospital

00:29:07.252 --> 00:29:09.700
to see if he could do something
with these exciting new

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:15.220
equations that his colleague,
Herr Doktor Professor Einstein,

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:17.160
had worked out.

00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.290
And he came up with this,
the first exact solution

00:29:20.290 --> 00:29:21.880
to the Einstein field equations.

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.790
And indeed, a solution
that continues

00:29:24.790 --> 00:29:30.700
to be of astrophysical and
observational importance today.

00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:33.490
He succumbed to the disease
that he was suffering

00:29:33.490 --> 00:29:37.960
and died several weeks after
coming up with this solution

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:38.710
and publishing it.

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.590
This was a solution which
stunned Einstein, who did not

00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:44.380
think that such a simple
solution would ever be found,

00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.030
such a simple exact
solution would ever

00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:48.400
be found to these
horrendous equations

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.740
that he had developed.

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:55.450
I always find this
story to be somewhat--

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.910
well, I'm not quite
sure what to make of it.

00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:00.940
In these days of
the coronavirus,

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:03.478
where we are all
isolating, we are--

00:30:03.478 --> 00:30:05.020
many of us now are
probably beginning

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.810
to hear stories of people we
know who may have the disease.

00:30:10.890 --> 00:30:12.870
Sometimes it's hard
for me to crawl out

00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:14.700
of bed in the morning.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:15.990
Somehow I do so.

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.150
And I sometimes
think to myself, what

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:20.190
would Karl Schwarzschild do?

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:24.180
He didn't let the fact that he
was dying of a lung infection

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:25.927
from--

00:30:25.927 --> 00:30:28.260
he did not let the fact he
was dying of a lung infection

00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.870
prevent him from leaving
an indelible stamp

00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:34.260
on the history of science.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:37.080
I do not aspire
to such greatness.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.510
I do not think I am
capable of such greatness.

00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:42.280
But it at least helps me to
get out of bed in the morning.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:49.710
So like I said,
this is a solution

00:30:49.710 --> 00:30:54.760
that is of observational
importance today.

00:30:54.760 --> 00:31:00.840
And one of the reasons
it has such significance

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:04.150
is due to a result known
as Birkhoff's theorem.

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:30.420
Birkhoff's theorem teaches
us that the exterior vacuum

00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:48.780
of any spherically
symmetric body

00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.550
is described by the
Schwarzschild metric.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:10.720
This is true even if the
source is time varying.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:13.420
So in doing this
derivation, I focused

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.410
on a situation in which
my spacetime was static.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:21.580
There is no time
dependence whatsoever.

00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:25.030
It turns out that
if it is not static,

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:29.140
if it is a time-varying
spacetime, as long as the time

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:33.010
variations preserve
spherical symmetry,

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.818
the exterior is still
described by Schwarzschild.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.890
It's even stronger than if--

00:32:54.890 --> 00:32:57.620
only if.

00:32:57.620 --> 00:33:07.100
As long as the time variations
preserve spherical symmetry.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.270
So for instance, it could
be radial pulsations.

00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:34.100
If it is not a variation that
preserves spherical symmetry,

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.620
you're very likely to have a
time-varying quadrupole moment,

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.900
and then you produce
gravitational waves.

00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:40.880
But if you have
time variations that

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:43.640
preserve spherical
symmetry, spherical symmetry

00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.820
does not allow us to have a
time-varying quadrupole moment.

00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:48.618
So no gravitational
waves are produced.

00:33:48.618 --> 00:33:50.660
And what this tells you
is that as long as you're

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.452
in this vacuum region
on the outside of it,

00:33:52.452 --> 00:33:56.210
your thing could be down
there going [VOCALIZING],,

00:33:56.210 --> 00:33:58.220
as long as it does
so in such a way that

00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:02.262
leaves it spherically
symmetric, then that

00:34:02.262 --> 00:34:03.720
is the spacetime
that describes it.

00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:07.740
You are completely ignorant
of what the radial extent

00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:08.670
of the matter is.

00:34:08.670 --> 00:34:12.389
It only matters that
you have a mass of m,

00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:15.719
and you are distance r
away from its center,

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.040
at least in these coordinates.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.679
In that sense, it's kind of
like Birkhoff's theorem plays

00:34:19.679 --> 00:34:25.710
a role similar to Gauss's
law in elementary electricity

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:26.429
and magnetism.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:28.429
If you have a spherically
symmetric distribution

00:34:28.429 --> 00:34:33.120
of charges, you are completely
agnostic as to what that--

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:36.540
what the radial distribution
of that spherical symmetry is.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:38.790
And in fact-- although, this
isn't usually discussed--

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:43.139
if that were to be sort of a
time variable kind of thing,

00:34:43.139 --> 00:34:45.260
as long as it was just
sort of homologous

00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.730
in moving these guys
in and out like that,

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:52.050
you would still just get the
E-field associated with a point

00:34:52.050 --> 00:34:53.980
charge at the origin.

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:56.295
This spacetime is kind of
the gravitational equivalent

00:34:56.295 --> 00:34:58.920
of a point charge at the origin,
a point I'm going to come back

00:34:58.920 --> 00:35:00.820
to in a future lecture.

00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:03.780
Let me just give you a brief
proof of Birkhoff's theorem.

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:18.680
So imagine I want to consider
a spacetime in which I

00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.280
allow my metric functions
to vary with time.

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:39.230
So go ahead and work
all of these guys.

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.710
Use that as your metric.

00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:44.600
Work out all of your
curvature tensors.

00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.657
We are focusing on the exterior
vacuum region of the star.

00:35:48.657 --> 00:35:50.990
So what we're going to do is
set those curvature tensors

00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:52.760
equal to 0.

00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:54.740
What you find when
you do this-- so

00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.380
when you work out your
curvature tensors, in addition

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:01.250
to those four that we had on
the center boards earlier,

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:04.370
the four components
of Ricci, you

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.200
find a new component enters.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:28.760
What you find is that there
is a component r sub tr,

00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:30.680
which looks like--
oops, pardon me--

00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:37.140
which looks like 2/r times the
time derivative of your lambda.

00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:40.710
This you are going to set
equal to 0 in the exterior.

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:43.670
So this tells you that the
time derivative of lambda is 0.

00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:54.010
This means that your
assumed lambda of t and r

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:55.210
is just a lambda of r.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.940
So there is no time
dependence in that lambda.

00:36:57.940 --> 00:36:59.080
So you just killed that.

00:37:03.390 --> 00:37:06.930
You can then look at your
other curvature components.

00:37:06.930 --> 00:37:09.690
And in particular, one of
the things that you'll see

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.640
is several of those
curvature components.

00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.190
You'll see that they pick up
a couple of additional terms

00:37:14.190 --> 00:37:17.910
involving d by dt as the various
of the lambdas and the phis.

00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:20.082
You can now get rid of those.

00:37:20.082 --> 00:37:22.290
Where I think it's particularly
clean to look at this

00:37:22.290 --> 00:37:25.740
is if you look at r theta theta.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.710
That turns out to be
completely unchanged.

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:44.860
So your analysis of
the r theta theta term,

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:46.545
it could proceed
exactly as before.

00:37:46.545 --> 00:37:47.920
But the other
thing you can do is

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.180
you can say, hey, guess what.

00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:53.620
I'm now going to imagine that
my phi is time dependent.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.480
My lambda is not time dependent.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.740
We just proved that.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.590
But my phi could be.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:02.470
Let's look at the time
derivative of this Ricci term.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.170
So if our r theta theta
is 0, the time derivative

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:06.520
of r theta theta must be 0.

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:14.020
So when I compute
this, this leads

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:19.140
to the requirement that
the double derivative,

00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.352
one derivative in r,
one derivative in phi--

00:38:21.352 --> 00:38:23.310
excuse me-- one derivative
in r, one derivative

00:38:23.310 --> 00:38:26.540
in t of the potential
phi must be equal to 0.

00:38:37.470 --> 00:38:57.220
And so this in turn tells us
for this condition to be true,

00:38:57.220 --> 00:38:58.350
it must be the case--

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.770
pardon me.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:05.460
Just one second.

00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:06.600
How does this follow?

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.170
Oh, no.

00:39:07.170 --> 00:39:07.770
Yeah, yeah.

00:39:07.770 --> 00:39:09.720
So this tells me
it must be the case

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:20.290
that phi can be separated
into a function of r

00:39:20.290 --> 00:39:22.690
in a function of t.

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:26.080
If I take the t derivative and
then the r derivative, I get 0.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:30.130
If I take the r derivative and
then the t derivative, I get 0.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:37.480
So my line element, my
most general line element

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:54.650
now appears to be something
that looks like this.

00:40:02.260 --> 00:40:04.780
But once I have this, I
can actually just redefine

00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.800
the time coordinate.

00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:07.750
I mean, if I look at
this thing I've got here,

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:18.990
I can just absorb a function
of t into my time coordinate,

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.030
just absorb it in a
time coordinate like so.

00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:31.600
And what happens is that I then
recover the Schwarzschild form

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:32.320
I originally had.

00:40:42.210 --> 00:40:43.440
So that's really nice.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:49.200
What this tells us is that any
spherically symmetric vacuum

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:54.120
spacetime is going to have
a time-like Killing vector.

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.840
And if it has a
time-like Killing vector,

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:42.060
that means that I can define
a notion of conserved energy

00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.418
for objects that are
moving in that spacetime.

00:42:06.100 --> 00:42:07.600
It's going to prove
very useful when

00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:11.340
we start discussing orbits.

00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:15.630
So this punch line
is this totally

00:42:15.630 --> 00:42:20.210
describes the exterior of
my compact spherical body.

00:42:20.210 --> 00:42:21.210
What about the interior?

00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:30.620
What we're going
to need to do is--

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:35.550
the interior has
non-zero stress energy.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.810
So we're going to need to look
at components of the Einstein

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:47.000
equation and equate them to the
source, my perfect fluid stress

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.310
energy tensor, and
see what develops.

00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:01.250
So what I'm going to do is
write my Einstein equation

00:43:01.250 --> 00:43:05.540
in the form of an
upstairs downstairs index.

00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:09.600
And I'm going to do it that
way, because t upstairs mu

00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.540
downstairs nu, it is represented
in the coordinate system I'm

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.170
working in here.

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:19.790
But assuming it's a
diagonal of minus rho ppp.

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.570
And I had all the Riemann--

00:43:27.570 --> 00:43:29.820
excuse me-- all the Ricci
components on the blackboard

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.320
a few moments ago.

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:36.930
From them, I can construct
my Einstein tensor.

00:43:36.930 --> 00:43:41.040
So there's a couple components
that turn out to be quite nice.

00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.630
One of them is the tt component.

00:43:45.630 --> 00:43:57.620
This turns out to be minus
1 over r squared d by dr r 1

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:01.100
minus e to the minus 2 lambda.

00:44:04.030 --> 00:44:07.570
What's nice about this is notice
it only depends on lambda.

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:14.060
This is going to be
equated to 8 pi g times

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.810
t stress energy tensor tt, which
is going to give me a minus rho

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:18.990
there.

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:22.397
So before I go and I do this,
let me make a definition.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:34.000
I'm going to call e
to the minus 2 lambda,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:41.600
I'm going to call that
1 minus 2gm of r over m.

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.280
What I'm effectively doing is
I am mapping my metric function

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:50.120
lambda to a function
m of r, which

00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:52.237
is a sort of mass function.

00:44:52.237 --> 00:44:54.320
Hopefully, you can kind
of see that by doing this,

00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:59.130
remember, that this
component of the metric,

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:02.360
it's going to enter
as e to the 2 lambda.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:04.640
And so when I
match this, this is

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:07.220
going to give me something
that very nicely matches

00:45:07.220 --> 00:45:09.235
to my exterior spacetime.

00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:27.230
So plugging that in there,
and valuing the derivatives,

00:45:27.230 --> 00:45:31.490
and equating this guy to
the stress energy tensor

00:45:31.490 --> 00:45:37.840
is going to give me a very nice
condition that the function

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:40.630
m of r must obey.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:21.030
So plugging all this stuff
in, I end up with minus 2g

00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:31.920
over r squared dm dr equals
minus 8 pi g rho of r.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:36.290
Turning things around,
I can turn this

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:40.610
into an integral solution, which
tells me that my mass function

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:47.960
m of r is what I get when I
integrate from 0 to r 4 pi

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:49.310
rho of r prime.

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:56.480
Two comments on this.

00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:59.063
You sort of look at this and go,
ah, that makes perfect sense.

00:46:59.063 --> 00:47:01.230
This is what you
would obviously get

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:06.300
if you integrate up a density
over a spherical volume.

00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.233
This is, hopefully,
beautifully intuitive.

00:47:09.233 --> 00:47:10.650
And you kind of
look at it and go,

00:47:10.650 --> 00:47:13.440
how could it be anything else?

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.840
Well, it could be anything else.

00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.645
So two comments to make.

00:47:17.645 --> 00:47:19.020
First of all, I
have set this up.

00:47:19.020 --> 00:47:21.219
I have imposed a
boundary condition.

00:47:28.203 --> 00:47:29.870
I have imposed a
boundary condition here

00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:33.915
that the mass enclosed
at radius 0 is 0.

00:47:33.915 --> 00:47:35.540
You might look at
that, and, well, duh.

00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.480
If I have a ball of radius 0,
there can't be any mass in it.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.370
Of course, you're
going to do that.

00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:42.860
Well, it's going to turn out
that black holes are actually

00:47:42.860 --> 00:47:46.340
solutions that violate
this boundary condition.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.600
Wah-wah.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:50.370
So there's that.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:55.080
The other thing to bear
in mind is that 4 pi--

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.590
the reason why this probably
makes intuitive sense

00:47:57.590 --> 00:48:15.270
is that in spherical
symmetry in Euclidean space,

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:22.500
4 pi r squared dr is the proper
volume element for a Euclidean

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.060
three-volume.

00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.040
We are not in Euclidean space.

00:48:27.040 --> 00:48:30.510
And so this is indeed
the definition of m of r,

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:34.950
but it is not what we would
get if we did a proper volume

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:40.210
integration of rho
over the volume that

00:48:40.210 --> 00:48:41.260
goes out to radius r.

00:48:48.920 --> 00:49:02.370
If I were to define a quantity
that is the proper volume

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:13.410
integrated rho, let's
call this m sub b.

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:15.068
Let's make it lowercase.

00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:24.060
I'll define why I'm calling
that b in just a moment.

00:49:27.690 --> 00:49:36.100
I could define
this as what I get

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.950
when I do a proper volume
integration of this thing

00:49:38.950 --> 00:49:40.585
in my curved spacetime.

00:49:53.970 --> 00:49:56.310
You get an additional factor.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:50:00.113
And what you find is
that this in general--

00:50:00.113 --> 00:50:02.280
so remember, this is going
to go into your spacetime

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:03.000
as a function.

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.375
It's going to look
like something

00:50:04.375 --> 00:50:09.120
like 1 over that factor there.

00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:14.937
This in general is
greater than m of r.

00:50:14.937 --> 00:50:17.270
So there is a homework exercise
where you guys are going

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.530
to explore this a little bit.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:29.240
m sub b is what I get when
I count up, essentially

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:33.920
including a factor of the
rest mass of every little--

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:37.310
let's call it baryon
that goes into this star.

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:41.120
This counts up the
total number of baryons

00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.030
present in my star
in something that's

00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:46.070
called the baryonic mass.

00:50:46.070 --> 00:50:51.380
This m that appears here
defines the amount of mass

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:54.470
that generates gravity.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:57.260
They are not the same.

00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:03.250
The gravitational mass is
generally somewhat less

00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:04.675
than the baryonic mass.

00:51:08.122 --> 00:51:10.080
You might sort of think,
well, where did it go?

00:51:12.690 --> 00:51:16.650
The missing mass
can be regarded as

00:51:16.650 --> 00:51:18.060
gravitational binding energy.

00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:33.260
It's really not
that it's missing.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:35.600
It's just that
gravitational energy

00:51:35.600 --> 00:51:37.080
holds this thing together.

00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.780
And whenever you
bind something, you

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:41.690
do that by putting it
in a lower energy state.

00:51:41.690 --> 00:51:45.770
Gravity is essentially
this sort of mb with this--

00:51:45.770 --> 00:51:49.460
the way to think of my
mb here is bear in mind

00:51:49.460 --> 00:51:51.360
that we're including factors--

00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.810
let's just put factors of
c squared back in here.

00:51:53.810 --> 00:51:56.840
This is adding up
the rest energy

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.920
of every particle in this star.

00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:01.730
But when I put
them all together,

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:03.400
gravity binds it together.

00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.150
And that actually takes
away some of that.

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:07.220
It puts it into a bound state.

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:12.080
And so the difference between
the baryonic mass, or energy,

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.330
and the gravitational
mass, and energy,

00:52:14.330 --> 00:52:17.030
tells you something about how
strongly bound this object is.

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:22.810
So that's one
important equation.

00:52:29.692 --> 00:52:31.400
It looks like I might
finish this lecture

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:35.900
up a little bit
on the early side,

00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:39.590
which is fine, because
I could use a break.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.250
Another one that
is important for us

00:52:42.250 --> 00:52:46.220
will be the rr component of
the stress energy tensor.

00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.600
So this guy, when
you work it out,

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.780
it looks like e to the
minus 2 lambda 2 over

00:52:54.780 --> 00:53:03.150
r d phi dr plus
1 over r squared.

00:53:06.290 --> 00:53:08.000
That's 1 over r squared.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:12.110
So let's insert our definition.

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:15.050
This prefactor is
minus-- excuse me--

00:53:15.050 --> 00:53:26.150
1 minus 2gm of r over r 2 phi--

00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.810
oh, shoot.

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:28.320
Pardon me.

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.880
Try that again--

00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:40.400
2 over r d phi dr plus 1 over
p square 1 over r squared.

00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:46.940
And we equate this to
the appropriate component

00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:52.370
of the stress energy
tensor, which is just

00:53:52.370 --> 00:53:54.660
going to be the pressure.

00:53:54.660 --> 00:53:56.900
This can be
rearranged and give us

00:53:56.900 --> 00:54:00.862
an equation for a differential
equation governing

00:54:00.862 --> 00:54:03.070
the metric potential, the
trigonometric function phi.

00:54:28.620 --> 00:54:41.957
So what results of
that exercise something

00:54:41.957 --> 00:54:54.532
that looks like this over this.

00:54:54.532 --> 00:54:56.990
So I would like to do something
with this in just a moment.

00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:58.407
But it's worth
commenting on this.

00:54:58.407 --> 00:55:03.140
So when one looks at the
gravitational potential

00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:08.420
in a spherical fluid body
in Newtonian gravity,

00:55:08.420 --> 00:55:13.070
you get gm of r over r squared.

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:15.690
So there's two interesting
things going on here.

00:55:15.690 --> 00:55:18.505
First, your m of
r, which appears

00:55:18.505 --> 00:55:19.880
in the numerator
of this thing is

00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:23.000
corrected by a term that
involves the pressure.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.550
What you are seeing
here is the fact

00:55:25.550 --> 00:55:29.130
that pressure in some
sense reflects work that

00:55:29.130 --> 00:55:30.390
is being done in this body.

00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:31.338
It's being squeezed.

00:55:31.338 --> 00:55:32.880
Gravity is sort of
squeezing it down,

00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.550
or your hands are
pushing it down.

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:37.560
When you give this
body some pressure,

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.420
you're doing work on it.

00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:43.830
Work adds to the energy
budget of that body.

00:55:43.830 --> 00:55:45.990
Energy gravitates.

00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:49.080
In the denominator, you're
getting this r minus 2--

00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:50.590
instead of just
having an r squared,

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:54.600
you get a correction that
involves this 2gm term in here.

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:56.490
And this is just
correcting for the fact

00:55:56.490 --> 00:56:00.930
that you are not working
in a Euclidean geometry.

00:56:00.930 --> 00:56:04.150
So now I want to do a
little bit more with this.

00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:09.430
And so let me borrow a result
from an old homework exercise.

00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:11.570
I believe this was on P set 3.

00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:12.820
Although I don't quite recall.

00:56:15.610 --> 00:56:17.950
So on this thing
you guys took a look

00:56:17.950 --> 00:56:25.330
at the equation of local
stress energy conservation

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:29.382
for a perfect fluid and
hydrostatic equilibrium.

00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:54.120
And what you found was that this
turns into a condition relating

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:58.720
the pressure,
density, and what you

00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:05.890
can kind of think of as
the four-acceleration

00:57:05.890 --> 00:57:17.570
of the fluid elements.

00:57:17.570 --> 00:57:20.120
So we see sort of gradients
of the pressure entering here,

00:57:20.120 --> 00:57:23.960
the density entering into
here, and some things

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:25.910
related to the behavior
of the fluid elements.

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:32.890
The spacetime that
we are working with

00:57:32.890 --> 00:57:36.370
is one where we have constrained
the behavior of that fluid.

00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:53.985
So we are going to
require that our fluid--

00:58:01.550 --> 00:58:02.550
let's write it this way.

00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:16.160
So our fluid only has a-- it's
only the time-like component

00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.530
of its four-velocity is 0.

00:58:18.530 --> 00:58:22.100
And so when I shoot that all
through the various things

00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:24.950
involved in there-- oh, and, of
course, phi only depends on r.

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:32.070
So what this equation
then boils down

00:58:32.070 --> 00:58:42.020
to is rho plus p times this
Christoffel symbol equals

00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:48.750
minus dp dr. When
you expand this out,

00:58:48.750 --> 00:58:55.670
this turns into
d phi dr. So what

00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:58.760
this tells me is that d
phi dr is simply related

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:00.290
to the pressure gradient.

00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:25.170
When you put all of this
together, what you get

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:29.490
is the following equation.

00:59:29.490 --> 00:59:31.950
This is sometimes
called the equation

00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:36.390
of relativistic
hydrostatic equilibrium.

00:59:36.390 --> 00:59:51.438
My pressure gradient must
satisfy this equation.

00:59:51.438 --> 00:59:52.980
Let me write down
two more, because I

00:59:52.980 --> 00:59:54.355
think I'm going
to actually begin

00:59:54.355 --> 00:59:57.690
with this board in
my next lecture.

00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:02.100
So I'm going to just repeat
this equation governing phi.

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:19.720
And m is defined
as this integral.

01:00:32.030 --> 01:00:35.500
So here are three coupled
differential equations,

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:39.620
which I can now use
to build a model

01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.810
for the interior of this body.

01:00:41.810 --> 01:00:43.170
We integrate this thing out.

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:48.710
Basically, the way it works is
you need to choose an initial--

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:50.090
some parameter
that characterizes

01:00:50.090 --> 01:00:51.050
the initial conditions.

01:00:51.050 --> 01:00:54.710
You typically choose a
density at the center.

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:57.920
You choose rho at r equals 0.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:00.680
You need an equation
of state that relates

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:03.130
the pressure and the density.

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:05.420
And then you just
integrate these guys up.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:06.920
There's a matching
that must be done

01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:09.712
at the surface of the star.

01:01:09.712 --> 01:01:11.170
Then once you've
done that, that'll

01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:12.600
end up giving you
sort of a notice

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:15.150
that by integrating
up this equation,

01:01:15.150 --> 01:01:18.000
you determined the
function phi up

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.400
to some constant of integration.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.440
When you match at the
surface of the star,

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.100
that lets you fix that
constant of integration.

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:26.640
Boom!

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.770
You've made yourself
a spacetime.

01:01:28.770 --> 01:01:39.420
This is known as the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff

01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:49.250
equation, universally
abbreviated TOV.

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:53.330
These are the way in
which we make spherically

01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:57.802
symmetric fluid bodies
in general relativity,

01:01:57.802 --> 01:01:59.510
spherically symmetric
static fluid bodies

01:01:59.510 --> 01:02:02.120
in general relativity.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:03.620
In the next lecture--
so we're going

01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.080
to end this one
a tiny bit early.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:09.990
This is actually a very
natural place to stop.

01:02:09.990 --> 01:02:11.690
I am going to start with this.

01:02:11.690 --> 01:02:14.210
And what we're going to
do is talk a little bit

01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:17.990
about how one solves these.

01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:21.278
And we're going to
look at a couple--

01:02:21.278 --> 01:02:23.570
we're going to look at one
particular special solution,

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:26.683
which is not very physical,
but it's illustrative.

01:02:26.683 --> 01:02:28.100
And I'm going to
talk a little bit

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:33.110
about how to solve this
for more realistic setups.

01:02:33.110 --> 01:02:37.100
That is in preparation for what
is one of my favorite homework

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:37.790
exercises.

01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:40.490
It's one where I give
you an equation of state.

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.920
And you guys just
take these equations.

01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:45.590
And using a numerical
integrator--

01:02:45.590 --> 01:02:48.360
I hope everyone has access to
something like Mathematica,

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.810
or WolframAlpha, or
something like this

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:53.840
in your dispersed lives.

01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:56.330
All MIT students should be
able to access the student

01:02:56.330 --> 01:02:57.575
license for Mathematica.

01:02:57.575 --> 01:02:59.450
So as long as you have
the hardware for that,

01:02:59.450 --> 01:03:00.170
you should be OK.

01:03:02.790 --> 01:03:04.510
And this is-- actually,
it's pretty cool.

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:06.810
You can make relativistic
stellar models.

01:03:06.810 --> 01:03:09.570
I've actually had
in the past students

01:03:09.570 --> 01:03:12.220
use this as the basis for
some research projects,

01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:15.180
because when you do
things like this,

01:03:15.180 --> 01:03:19.990
this is how professionals
make models of stars.

01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:21.640
So we will stop there.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:25.960
And those of you who
are watching at home,

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:28.680
you can go on to the next video,
where we'll be doing this.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.500
As for me, I'm going to
take a bit of a break,

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:35.510
and start recording again
in about a half an hour.

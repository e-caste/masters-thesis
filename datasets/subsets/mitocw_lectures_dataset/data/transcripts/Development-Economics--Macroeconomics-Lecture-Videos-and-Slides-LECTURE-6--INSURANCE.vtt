00:00:27.266 --> 00:00:30.850
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's
the starting point,

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.500
but we're going to then move,
in the latter half of the class,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.290
to what to make of it, what
happens if you find that it's

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.110
complete or incomplete,
how to think

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:46.980
about policy through
the lens of this model,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.310
how to design insurance
instruments, what damage they

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.790
actually might do, what the
distribution of benefits

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.320
might be.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.420
There is a recurring
theme today,

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.750
which wouldn't surprise
you, knowing me, which

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.050
is theory is guiding
the whole discussion,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.730
rather than starting with
some randomized control trial

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.850
and targeting, but we
will get to those control

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.410
trials in the discussion.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.150
OK.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.260
So here's the outline.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.500
We'll look at risk and
insurance and village

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.650
India, move to a
benchmark way of measuring

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.700
the effectiveness of
financial institutions

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.070
on the formal side.

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.380
We'll then couple that with
work on the informal side

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.060
and networks and so on.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.080
We'll get to this--

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.540
can well-intended
interventions actually

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.740
result in well welfare losses?

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:01.300
And then issues of why insurance
take up in many circumstances

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.710
is actually quite low.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.750
The idea here is that
people in village India,

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.700
and developing economies
more generally,

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.900
live in very high-risk
environments.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.510
There are ways to
cope with this risk--

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.990
ex-ante and ex-post.

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.010
Ex-ante, you can diversify
your crops, fields, activities,

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.950
and occupations.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.905
Ex-post, you can have financial
transactions, gifts, loans.

00:02:43.905 --> 00:02:46.680
I actually mentioned
this the first lecture.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.610
How well are households doing?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.130
So the idea in this
paper is forget

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.900
enumerating all the mechanisms.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.750
You're likely to miss one
anyway and the measurement

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:04.920
might be really bad.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.080
Let's just look at the outcomes.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.700
The null hypothesis-- If
risk sharing were perfect,

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.210
what would you expect to see
in consumption and income data?

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.740
I think this style of work,
although nowadays it's

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.370
not only accepted, it's highly
utilized all over the place,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.710
but initially there was a
confusion that perfect means

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.590
complete as incomplete
markets, and somehow you're

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.070
saying you're going to have all
these Arrow-Debreu securities

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.350
being traded in a
village economy,

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.560
and no, that's not the idea.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.270
Informal institutions can be
at work, as well as some spot

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.920
market exchanges.

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.930
You don't need to take
a stand on any of that

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.805
if you're just going to
look at the outcomes.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.170
So the idea is
individual consumption

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.210
should actually not depend on
individual income, stunningly.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:14.120
Once you control for
aggregate consumption,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.560
it's as if all these households
lived in a big risk syndicate,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.839
and they were just pooling
all their grain and so

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.530
on in one big pile, and
then depending on shares,

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.380
and some people are
more equal than others,

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.540
they get a fraction
of the grain.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.840
A pile of the grain can go up
and down with village aggregate

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.910
shocks, but controlling
for those shocks,

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.390
your contribution has nothing
to do with what you take out.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.475
So where to test?

00:04:56.917 --> 00:04:58.750
We're going to do these
tests at the village

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.500
level in this starting point of
this lecture, but we'll move.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.790
It could be kinship
networks within a village,

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.200
family related people.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.450
It could be bigger than that.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.680
It could be a
cross-village risk sharing.

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.480
It could be that being a member
of a financial institution,

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.580
for example, is allowing
you to be part of a larger

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.580
risk pooling population.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.330
So it's a judgment call
about where to apply it.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.930
Fortunately in the work
today, I can show you it

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.470
being applied at various
distinct levels, which

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.210
is a theme we'll come back
to next Thursday as well.

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:43.700
Why did I choose villages?

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.130
I had some idea that
everybody knows each other,

00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.580
and the environment
is relatively simple,

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.620
and it just seemed like
the idealized setting.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.190
Of course, in practice not
all villages are alike,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.320
and they're pretty
complicated, and you've

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.240
got people interacting
with one another,

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.280
and they don't all
love each other.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.520
But that was the
motivation to begin with.

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.180
By the way, if there's
no idiosyncratic risk

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.900
there's nothing to test,
because the benchmark

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.090
says controlling
for the aggregate is

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:30.170
the idiosyncratic influencing
consumption or not.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.620
And if there's no idiosyncratic,
it's all aggregate,

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:37.080
you can't do that test.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:39.880
This extends, of course,
beyond households

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.900
within a village to tests
across villages and so on.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.500
Now, many people have the
idea that villages which

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.910
they may never go
into are all alike,

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.860
and it's all a function
of the rainfall,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.460
and it's all aggregate, and
that's just not true at all.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:07.880
And I'll show you the front end
of this paper, some statistics.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.130
Although it is true there
may be a lot of diversity

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.580
in a village, if they all
completely diversified

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.060
and did not specialize and they
all held a common portfolio,

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:19.250
then, again, there
would be nothing

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:24.130
to test as if they're doing it
all ex-ante and not ex-post,

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:27.700
because the starting point would
be the income coming from all

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.410
these diversified activities.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.530
But again, they don't do that.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.360
So let's take a look, these
so-called ICRISAT villages--

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.090
Institute for Crops Research
in the Semi-Arid Tropic--

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:52.990
at one point that was the source
of virtually the only panel

00:07:52.990 --> 00:08:00.030
data on developing
countries in the world.

00:08:00.030 --> 00:08:02.830
And it was gathered monthly,
and essentially for 10 years.

00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:05.860
They've started it up
again, interestingly.

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.840
And there are other data
sets like that, where

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.930
there are gaps of decades.

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:15.670
So it's not true that
ICRISAT was the only source

00:08:15.670 --> 00:08:17.470
of panel variation.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.210
In Aurepalle, they're
growing castor and sorghum.

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:25.120
Each crop is quite risky if
you look at the coefficient

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.300
of variation.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.100
Those numbers are
comparable to something

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:36.159
I did in medieval England,
where roughly every 12,

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:40.080
13 years, they would
experience a famine.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:45.630
So these are high-risk
environments.

00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:50.320
Of course you could
diversify across these crops.

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.730
That helps.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:54.520
Depending on the pair
of crops that you pick,

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:57.910
the cross-crop correlations
could be as low as 0.09

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.100
or something much higher.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.110
A low number is a good
thing, because you

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:03.700
can spread your risk.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.420
Soil isn't uniform either.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.340
You can look, for a
given crop, at how

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:16.990
the coefficient of variation
varies from one type of soil

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.350
to another.

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:21.580
And again, the cross-soil
correlation for a given crop

00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:25.780
is 0.37, and relatively low.

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:27.880
Nevertheless, as I
said, it's not true

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.120
that all households hold
a diversified basket

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.540
of all these things.

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.040
Yes.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.498
AUDIENCE: Are there any
crops that are negatively

00:09:34.498 --> 00:09:35.956
correlated with each other?

00:09:39.507 --> 00:09:41.090
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Not
in these numbers,

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.190
although I certainly
wouldn't rule it out.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.750
Well, and some of those
numbers are point estimates,

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:51.590
relatively low.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:55.935
And you put the standard
error bands, and yeah.

00:09:55.935 --> 00:09:56.920
OK.

00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.480
This is by cruder categories,
like labor income, income

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:04.690
from trade and handicrafts,
animal husbandry.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.280
And it's stratified, as ICRISAT
did, by the amount of land

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.240
that they hold--

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.810
none, small, medium,
and large landholders.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:19.120
And these are sort of
basically fractions of income

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.130
that they get from such things.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:26.710
Large landholders have the bulk
of their income from crops,

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:29.860
and a substantial amount
from animal husbandry.

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.910
People without land virtually
have no crop income.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.830
And the dominant
source is from labor.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.930
And there's everything
else in between,

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:41.080
as you might anticipate.

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.030
There were three
villages involved.

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:46.480
That pattern is pretty common.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.270
And here, again, by
those income sources--

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:50.860
(EXCITEDLY) hey, a
negative number--

00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:58.070
again, in the lower bound of
the stair of the confidence

00:10:58.070 --> 00:10:58.570
interval.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.180
Well, actually this is--

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.980
even the point
estimates went negative.

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:10.990
Sorry, no no.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.040
Yes, yes.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.880
This is hard to read because
these items should also

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.020
be listed on the rows.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.730
So if you're going
down the diagonal,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:24.820
you're reading the
coefficient of variation,

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.040
and then above and
below the diagonal,

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:33.190
you're reading the
correlation of, say,

00:11:33.190 --> 00:11:37.975
in this case, livestock
income with profit income.

00:11:37.975 --> 00:11:40.600
It just throws you off, because
it should be written down here.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.763
And then to avoid
double counting,

00:11:42.763 --> 00:11:44.555
you don't fill in the
bottom of the matrix.

00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:53.470
So I've shown you
this picture before,

00:11:53.470 --> 00:12:01.458
the Rocky Mountain picture,
arguably the most famous graph

00:12:01.458 --> 00:12:02.250
I've ever produced.

00:12:04.980 --> 00:12:07.920
This is 10 years of data.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.260
And then the households
are lined up--

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.500
which is why I keep showing it--

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.270
the households are
lined up roughly

00:12:15.270 --> 00:12:17.800
by the size of landholdings.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:22.800
And you can see the levels
kind of going up as they

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:26.250
have more and more land.

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.270
And there's a 0 here.

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.220
And so everything
on this diagram

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:37.170
is deviation from the village
average at a point in time.

00:12:37.170 --> 00:12:39.900
Some people are below and
some people are above.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:45.240
You're seeing that
in the cross section,

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.270
and you're seeing
that over time.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.100
The point of the diagram,
I've said before,

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:52.800
is that some of the valleys
lie behind the peaks.

00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.130
And that means not everyone
is experiencing good years

00:12:56.130 --> 00:12:59.970
and bad years at the same time.

00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:06.420
It's not like undulating
waves of grain, as in Kansas.

00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:08.760
This is the consumption
picture that

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.940
is on the same scale
as the income picture.

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.130
If I wanted to get
bigger differences,

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:17.690
I could rescale this graph.

00:13:17.690 --> 00:13:19.710
You know, it's all just
suppressed down there.

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.160
But the statistical
work is really

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.760
testing to see if there
are common fixed effects,

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.090
and also whether this diagram
somehow, through the lens

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.480
of the model, is related to
the income diagram previously.

00:13:38.835 --> 00:13:40.543
AUDIENCE: Have you
observed this in terms

00:13:40.543 --> 00:13:42.983
of like greater
weights on people?

00:13:42.983 --> 00:13:45.150
Because it looks like there's
not only risk-sharing,

00:13:45.150 --> 00:13:48.000
but also the rich guys are--

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.350
if it's the same [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.175
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, exactly.

00:13:50.175 --> 00:13:51.830
AUDIENCE: They're not
just getting the average.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:53.080
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's right.

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.530
So risk-sharing is
sometimes misinterpreted

00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:59.170
to mean complete pooling, and
everyone has an equal share.

00:13:59.170 --> 00:14:00.660
And that's not necessary.

00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.360
And when we look at the
benchmark regression,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.050
essentially it
has fixed effects.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.860
And those fixed effects
are almost exactly

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.070
the Pareto weights.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.810
And then we can
test and see what

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:14.340
those weights are related to.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:25.510
So here's the
optimization problem.

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:30.010
You just basically-- there
is a one-to-one relationship

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:35.230
between all the Pareto-optimal
allocations in this economy

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:38.350
and solutions to this
programming problem.

00:14:42.236 --> 00:14:44.570
And that's asking about
the Pareto weights.

00:14:44.570 --> 00:14:47.720
Here they are-- lambda
sub-k, different

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.000
for different households, k.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.120
The household is the
basic unit, although we

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.860
will control for
the demographics

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:56.700
within the household.

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:00.720
So just to read
across this, it's

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.470
a weighted average, lambda,
Pareto-weighted average

00:15:04.470 --> 00:15:09.060
of the discounted
expected utility of, say,

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.610
in this case, household k.

00:15:11.610 --> 00:15:15.410
OK, so it's over time, which
could be finite or infinite.

00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:17.850
It's discounted
at a common rate.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.510
I'll come back to that.

00:15:19.510 --> 00:15:21.720
It's presumed everyone
has equal probability

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.310
over these states of the world.

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:32.070
And these states of
the world are not just

00:15:32.070 --> 00:15:36.200
the contemporaneous
realization of all the shocks.

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:40.580
It's the entire history, from
the initial date out to that,

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.350
like the branches of a tree.

00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:47.610
And then utility
contemporaneously

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:54.550
depends on consumption and
these gender/age weights.

00:15:54.550 --> 00:16:00.480
So and you just want to--
whatever sums of consumption

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.090
is, it's this average
and the aggregate.

00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:05.460
And then the idea is how to
distribute that aggregate

00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.365
to maximize this
subjective function.

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.520
You can put labor in here.

00:16:12.520 --> 00:16:14.020
We'll have a whole
lecture on that.

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:17.470
So what is the solution?

00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.280
Let's just pick consumption
of household k at date t

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.800
is entering in here,
and it's entering

00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.030
in this resource constraint.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.850
This supplies, you know, for
the whole history of states

00:16:30.850 --> 00:16:34.300
up to date, t,
for every date, t.

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:37.030
So we're going to
get derivative here,

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.650
and a Lagrange multiplier here.

00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.700
This is common
resource constraints.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.660
So you pick up a common
Lagrange multiplier.

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:44.946
Yes.

00:16:44.946 --> 00:16:48.390
AUDIENCE: Does the [? ht ?]
include the use of [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:48.390 --> 00:16:49.520
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.020
Yep.

00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:57.040
A complete enumeration of
everything, and not just crops,

00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:00.700
but babies, and deaths, and the
whole demographic structure.

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.869
So again, taking
that derivative,

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:12.400
putting this thing
over here, you'd

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:17.260
get a beta-discounted
probability, lambda k weighted

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.280
marginal utility.

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.410
And everyone's margin
utility is being

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:23.680
equated to this common
Lagrange multiplier.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:36.020
You know, so if you assumed a
particular exponential utility

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:40.190
function, for example,
then you can actually

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.680
get sort of closed-form
analytic solutions

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.820
for these first-order
conditions.

00:17:44.820 --> 00:17:47.240
So this just says, in
levels, that the consumption

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.180
of household k depends
on the Pareto--

00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:53.510
the log Pareto weight
of household k.

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:57.080
It has something to do with
the demographics and something

00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:00.260
to do with this common
shadow price of consumption,

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.610
if I dare call it that.

00:18:06.350 --> 00:18:08.980
So here are the levels that
we were just talking about.

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:17.260
This is too small to
read, but basically--

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.850
another nice thing about
that exponential utility,

00:18:27.850 --> 00:18:29.740
if you're willing to
make strong assumptions

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:33.190
about the composition
of the household,

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:37.520
is it basically would
dictate how to weight people.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:43.890
And little babies don't eat
as much as 18-year-old males.

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:50.110
And in turn, consumption is
dropping for the elderly.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.260
So we actually had
a dietary survey.

00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:55.240
And we assumed that
strong functional form,

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.900
and we made all
those corrections.

00:18:56.900 --> 00:19:01.560
So you don't actually
see people eating.

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:04.320
So you don't see their
individual consumptions.

00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.900
You see the consumption
for the whole household, k,

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.840
but you put it in per
capita terms by dividing

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:17.460
by the age/gender-weighted
number of people.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.520
Likewise, this
thing over here is

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:26.000
the sum in the whole population
of per-capita consumption.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.570
And sort of reading
out loud, this term

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:35.850
is actually the risk tolerance,
the inverse risk aversion,

00:19:35.850 --> 00:19:36.825
of household k.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.890
It's actually a j here.

00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:44.300
Sorry.

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.730
Household j relative
to the sum of the risk

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:51.200
tolerances of all
the other households.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:54.880
And I'll come back
to this often.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:59.140
If you assumed homogeneous risk
aversion, which is standard,

00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.660
then this ought to have
a coefficient of 1.

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:05.740
So everybody's consumption
is co-moving, one to one,

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:09.560
with the per capita average.

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.600
If you have different
risk aversions,

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.060
there is a very nice
interpretation here, which

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:16.010
is this is aggregate risk.

00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.800
This is what's left over
after all the other smoothing

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.900
that they're doing
intertemporally, blah, blah,

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.470
blah, than what
they actually eat.

00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:27.320
So this is like the macro risk.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:32.000
And then the higher this
risk tolerance, the more they

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.740
should be willing to bear
that, quote, "helping"

00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.610
out their village neighbors
who might be quite risk-averse.

00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:44.480
And we'll come back
to that in terms

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.290
of measuring risk aversion.

00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.020
OK, so here's the standard
regression equation.

00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:54.500
If the level of consumption
depends on basically

00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:59.350
what is now a constant
household-specific term, which

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:02.960
are those Pareto weights,
sum-- coefficients, time,

00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.380
village average
consumption-- at date t,

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.840
adjustment for demographics,
and something else that

00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.420
ought to be zero, like income.

00:21:20.250 --> 00:21:23.490
You're going to have a devil
of a time running this.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:28.160
Even when you run one
household at a time ignoring

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.360
all the others, even when
you use the leave out mean--

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.060
so the household
is not included--

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.950
it will turn out,
amazingly enough,

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:42.260
that these coefficients,
one for each household, when

00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:47.860
you average them up, have
to take on the value of 1.

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:53.230
So there are sort of
econometric issues

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:57.160
here that you could
mistakenly think

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.882
that you've got a
lot of co-movement,

00:21:58.882 --> 00:22:01.090
and it's just going to
happen-- you know, why is this

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:02.620
happening, essentially?

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.610
Well, it's more obvious if you
had the panel in front of us

00:22:06.610 --> 00:22:08.440
rather than one
household at a time.

00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.920
You're looking at household
consumption on the left,

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.980
and the average of household
consumption on the right.

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:18.020
Now take the average
of the whole thing,

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:20.350
and the averages appearing
on the left and the right,

00:22:20.350 --> 00:22:22.210
and it ought to take
on a value of 1.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:25.630
So the average tendency
of the dependent variable

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:28.570
is kind of like an intercept.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:30.430
So that's kind of the intuition.

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:34.780
This also comes up in
many situations where you

00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:36.770
have this confounding problem.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:37.270
Yes.

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:39.645
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] talked
about [? instead of their ?]

00:22:39.645 --> 00:22:40.690
[? compatibility? ?]

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.357
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No,
because we're going

00:22:42.357 --> 00:22:44.110
to assume full commitment--

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:45.408
instead of compatibility?

00:22:45.408 --> 00:22:46.450
Did I hear you correctly?

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:47.033
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:48.550
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:22:48.550 --> 00:22:52.630
We can put in
incentive constraints.

00:22:52.630 --> 00:22:54.880
And we will later.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:58.660
So we're going to build
on this basic framework,

00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:00.700
and get to all the
obstacles to trade,

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:03.240
and how to estimate them.

00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.250
But you may think this thing
would be rejected out of hand.

00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:10.100
And it is statistically
rejected most of the time.

00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:13.520
But it turns out to be a
very, very useful benchmark.

00:23:18.830 --> 00:23:23.300
So this is the time series,
one household at a time.

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.030
I won't say much
about this other

00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:27.260
than, does the data
have any power.

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:31.070
The problem is, you test one
null, like full risk-sharing.

00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:33.500
And you can't reject it because
the confidence intervals

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.310
are so large.

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:37.700
So you want to test other
things like its autarky.

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:40.940
And the weight of the
evidence is it's not autarky.

00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:43.265
We can pretty much
soundly reject--

00:23:48.858 --> 00:23:50.400
And risk-sharing is
doing quite well.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.300
And this is with a panel.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.920
And again, I'm going to
spare you all the details.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.940
But we did it three
different ways--

00:23:56.940 --> 00:24:02.790
standard, first
difference, Jerry Hausman--

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:04.050
and estimated.

00:24:04.050 --> 00:24:06.510
Now, here we're
picking up coefficients

00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:09.960
on various sources of
income, none of which

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:11.940
should be positive
and significant.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.670
But some of them kind of are.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:17.430
For example, the
highest number here

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:21.100
is profits from trade and
handicrafts in Aurepalle.

00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:24.810
They're climbing palm
trees and tapping--

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.270
and then making liquor, toddy.

00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:32.280
And it's not insured, evidently.

00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:40.860
Labor in general has a
high number pretty much

00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.160
in all the villages.

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:46.680
So now we're kind of easing
into the policy thing, which

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.080
is, if you wanted a
target, wouldn't you

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.150
want to run this thing
first and see who's

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.720
the most vulnerable,
and then sort of guide

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.460
your interventions.

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:58.990
Based on that, I wasn't
thinking along that line,

00:24:58.990 --> 00:25:01.530
I was just being
honest about where

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.300
we're rejecting and so on.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:13.790
And here, finally, Matt, is
where we took this coefficient

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:19.680
and regressed it
against other things

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.840
like the area operated by
the household, the value

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.990
of their plow animals,
their inheritance,

00:25:27.990 --> 00:25:29.250
and so on and so forth.

00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.530
And I'm not sure what
you would expect.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:38.220
It looks good at first
blush, in the sense

00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.910
that the amount of land and
the value of the animals

00:25:41.910 --> 00:25:44.172
is correlated with
those intercepts.

00:25:47.130 --> 00:25:51.240
The problem is things are
more turbulent than that

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.290
at the village level.

00:25:52.290 --> 00:25:55.140
And people do sell, or
buy, or acquire land.

00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.990
And certainly those
plow animals aren't just

00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:01.650
locked in place year
after year after year.

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:05.070
So that's kind of some
evidence of some kind

00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:10.740
of long-term impact that shows
up in terms of the assets

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:12.570
they end up holding.

00:26:12.570 --> 00:26:14.460
And that's very much
along the lines of,

00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:17.820
is there a moral hazard
problem or some kind

00:26:17.820 --> 00:26:19.140
of incentive constraint?

00:26:19.140 --> 00:26:24.300
And how should wealth levels
behave if that were the case?

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.970
The biggest puzzle in
these data, in some sense,

00:26:31.970 --> 00:26:38.670
is almost the opposite,
which is although we see them

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:48.150
over 10 years, we see the
upper-caste, white-robed

00:26:48.150 --> 00:26:51.540
brahman-type guys in the
village just consistently eating

00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:55.270
far less than their
income, constantly.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:58.470
And so is this just a
social transfer mechanism,

00:26:58.470 --> 00:27:01.680
or are they actually
insuring themselves

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.760
against future relabeling of--

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.590
castes, by the way
do get relabeled,

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.070
and histories get recreated.

00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:13.730
It it's a much more complicated
history than you might--

00:27:13.730 --> 00:27:17.130
at least that's what the
anthropologists tell me.

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:25.970
OK, so that's risk and
insurance in village India.

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:32.840
So let's take that framework
and start knocking off

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.180
some policy questions.

00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:38.930
So first is about
the effectiveness

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:40.310
of financial institutions.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:45.410
Now, let me just say, the
immediate policy implication

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:50.870
coming out of village
India was basically,

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:56.200
miraculously, somehow,
they're pooling all that risk.

00:27:56.200 --> 00:28:00.480
It's not a bunch of fragmented
households on their own,

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.830
in autarky.

00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:04.380
It seems to be
more the opposite.

00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:08.010
So there was a huge
firestorm people

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.790
had a hard time accepting
that something like that

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:12.420
could happen.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:18.900
But villages, even if they
were amazingly good not,

00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:22.440
are not necessarily
interacting with each other.

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.150
I'll come back to that.

00:28:24.150 --> 00:28:27.420
And there may be, as there
is in Thailand, transactions

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:29.230
with outside financial
institutions.

00:28:29.230 --> 00:28:33.990
So the question is, do outside
formal financial institutions

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:39.070
help, if not within the
village, then across village,

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:41.350
in the mitigation of risk?

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.610
So roughly speaking,
the treatment group

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.640
is a set of households
who are customers

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.710
of financial institutions.

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:57.760
A little typo there.

00:29:00.790 --> 00:29:03.940
And that's measured-- their
use of the institution

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:07.450
is actually measured in the
data, which is reassuring.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:13.060
And I'll tell you about the
instruments we use momentarily.

00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:15.580
So we're going to go back to
that consumption equation,

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:21.100
and also derive a corresponding
investment equation,

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:27.250
and then see whether being
a customer or a member

00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:29.260
lowers the vulnerability
in the sense

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.940
of that coefficient
on idiosyncratic risk.

00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:32.440
Yes.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.050
AUDIENCE: So when we say
those with financial access

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:38.290
are compared to those
without, so does

00:29:38.290 --> 00:29:40.420
that really mean
those with access

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:43.187
to the formal financial
sector are compared without--

00:29:43.187 --> 00:29:44.770
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
That's what it means.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:46.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because
there's money-lending sectors

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:46.820
et cetera.

00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.500
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Exactly.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.430
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:52.350
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So yeah,
that's like one topic away.

00:29:52.350 --> 00:29:55.270
I'll come right back to that.

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:58.240
But to answer your
question, it's

00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:01.270
going to turn out that
directly connected,

00:30:01.270 --> 00:30:05.020
at least in consumption,
is helpful, but indirectly

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.810
connected, through
gifts and loans

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:10.660
to someone in the village,
even though you're not,

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.230
is as effective in
consumption-smoothing.

00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:20.350
So that's then consistent
with the previous paper,

00:30:20.350 --> 00:30:22.875
although it's not quite
so clean with investment.

00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:32.080
So what are these institutions?

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:35.470
Well, by now you probably
know the names of them.

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:39.640
They've been coming up
in previous lectures.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.660
We find that this
bank for agriculture

00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.460
and agricultural cooperatives
is helpful in smoothing

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:46.840
consumption and investment.

00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:49.300
It looks, from the
transactions data,

00:30:49.300 --> 00:30:52.390
is if that has to do with
its credit operation.

00:30:52.390 --> 00:30:55.180
They're basically embedding
credit and insurance

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.640
in their loan contracts.

00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:01.000
It's not, "you pay back
the loan or default."

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:04.900
There's a whole
schedule for repayment.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:09.470
And it's adjusted by aggregate
local/regional shocks,

00:31:09.470 --> 00:31:10.990
and so on.

00:31:10.990 --> 00:31:15.260
It's quite sophisticated.

00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:18.260
In the financial
crisis, the World Bank

00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:22.190
went in there determined to
see this stereotype everywhere,

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:26.330
since remember, finance
companies and commercial bank

00:31:26.330 --> 00:31:29.270
failures triggered the
Asia financial crisis.

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:35.870
So they looked at the BAAC
history of over arrears,

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.300
and concluded that it
was another disaster.

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:41.870
But actually they were running
an insurance operation.

00:31:41.870 --> 00:31:44.140
And that's what shows up
in the consumption data.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.240
Commercial banks are
helping to smooth somewhat.

00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:53.770
It's largely, though, through
formal savings accounts.

00:31:53.770 --> 00:31:55.720
Loans are pretty
thin in the data.

00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:02.920
So what are we going to do?

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.680
You've seen this model before.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.720
This is Greenwood and Javanovic.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:14.570
By the way, we're sort of in the
data micro part of the class.

00:32:14.570 --> 00:32:17.470
Don't forget about
all that macro.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:20.770
So the Greenwood-Jovanovic
model assumes

00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:23.620
that the benefit of being
in a financial institution

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:28.390
is better information
and risk-sharing.

00:32:28.390 --> 00:32:31.120
So here we are
looking at the data

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.730
to see if that's a
good assumption or not,

00:32:33.730 --> 00:32:36.130
actually institution
by institution.

00:32:36.130 --> 00:32:41.350
So there is a direct,
immediate link

00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:45.130
of this micro work with
those macro models.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:47.110
Or even if we reject,
then it should

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:51.390
inform what we assume
within those macro models.

00:32:51.390 --> 00:32:54.100
So remember, in
Greenwood and Javanovic,

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:58.390
there was a cost to joining
the financial system.

00:32:58.390 --> 00:33:02.770
We're going to let this be
a household-specific cost.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:04.720
And basically we're
going to want something

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.420
like instruments, like
distance from the branch, which

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.860
varies across households.

00:33:17.830 --> 00:33:20.920
Just a little bit on
the underlying model,

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.620
just to remind you, because
you've actually seen it before.

00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:28.570
You've got output, which is a
function of the current capital

00:33:28.570 --> 00:33:36.400
stock, and then the sum of an
aggregate idiosyncratic shock,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:39.970
aggregate at the whatever
level, regional/national level,

00:33:39.970 --> 00:33:43.620
idiosyncratic at the
level of the households.

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:48.150
As I said, we're going to
embed investment in this,

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:51.240
adding that to the risk and
insurance in village India.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.000
So there's going to be some
adjustment costs to adjusting

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:55.620
your capital stock.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:59.895
This is also buffeted
around by IID shocks.

00:34:03.400 --> 00:34:05.350
This is new.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:06.760
This is a preference shock.

00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:09.550
We're going to put something
in the utility function which

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.960
is autocorrelated.

00:34:13.770 --> 00:34:16.360
I'm actually bending
over backwards

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.650
to create a bias here.

00:34:19.650 --> 00:34:24.280
What we're going to want to
be able to do an instrument is

00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:27.639
to say that the
instrument has to do with,

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:30.159
does influence the
selection of being

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:32.889
a member of a
financial institution,

00:34:32.889 --> 00:34:38.500
and conditioned on that, does
not influence the outcome,

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:39.699
in the future, at least.

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:42.219
But you can imagine, with
autocorrelated preference

00:34:42.219 --> 00:34:44.500
shocks, that part
of the decision

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.659
to join the financial
institution today

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.170
has to do with that
urgency or patience.

00:34:50.170 --> 00:34:51.940
And if that carries
on into the future,

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.695
it will also affect the
endogenous variables.

00:34:54.695 --> 00:34:56.320
So we want to make
it hard, and then we

00:34:56.320 --> 00:35:02.380
want to get rid of
the problem, to show

00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.140
that we have the ability
to get rid of the problem.

00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:08.200
You may remember how
this works, though.

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.400
You create a value function
for being a participant

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.560
in the financial system.

00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.650
If you join, you subtract
off that fixed cost.

00:35:18.650 --> 00:35:24.570
And this is just the array
of the other variables.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.150
You're joining after the
realization of the adjustment

00:35:27.150 --> 00:35:30.570
cost shock, the idiosyncratic
and aggregate shock,

00:35:30.570 --> 00:35:32.070
and the preference shock.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.260
You could choose not to join.

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.330
You'd have another
value function.

00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:41.300
I think we even used V and
W in the earlier lecture.

00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:44.490
So but you don't
subtract off the cost

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.380
from the capital stock.

00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:50.370
If you saw the autarky problem,
then you've kind of already

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:52.830
seen the solution to
the consumption part

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:56.460
of the intermediated problem.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:02.670
You can just sort of list
the equations for p equal 1,

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:04.320
participant.

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.170
They've got the
V value function.

00:36:07.170 --> 00:36:12.390
You've got consumption as a
function of your preference

00:36:12.390 --> 00:36:14.820
shock, and aggregate
consumption, and your Pareto

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.710
weight.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:19.450
By the way, you haven't
seen this today,

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:23.160
but investment is also a
function of the adjustment

00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:29.520
cost, the capital stock, and
the same aggregate consumption.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.920
Because it's the same
resource constraint.

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:35.340
So the price of consumption
today, actually,

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.550
versus tomorrow, is
not only influencing

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:44.040
consumption, it's influencing
investment intertemporally.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:53.730
And we'll come back
to that and repeat it

00:36:53.730 --> 00:36:55.750
in the lecture on Thursday.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.280
And this is just the
autarky equation.

00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.410
You don't see aggregate
consumption anywhere.

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.930
People are on their
own, and so on.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:05.910
There's no way you
could see and totally

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:10.410
understand all the individual
variables at this level.

00:37:10.410 --> 00:37:12.060
I'm going too fast for that.

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:16.940
But I just want you to think
about what you see in the data.

00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:21.460
You're going to see kind
of a weighted average

00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:26.350
of these things, weighted
by participation.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:28.990
So actually you're
either in this branch

00:37:28.990 --> 00:37:31.610
or you're in this one.

00:37:31.610 --> 00:37:33.485
And being an instrument
for these Ps.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:39.700
But anyway, it's convenient
to write it down this way,

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:44.200
and derive the sort of
econometric equations

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.850
you're going to
take to the data.

00:37:51.530 --> 00:37:53.050
I actually take
first differences,

00:37:53.050 --> 00:37:55.600
but the same principle applies.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:00.400
These instruments are the
history of the person's

00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:01.660
institutional use.

00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:04.300
Like predetermined
variables is an indicator

00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:11.500
for their current participation
at the village level,

00:38:11.500 --> 00:38:14.020
actually, not at
the household level.

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.822
The time to the district
center is the most compelling.

00:38:16.822 --> 00:38:19.030
That's like how long does
it take to get to the bank.

00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.080
And then we have some
GIS measure of access

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.260
in the local area, which is
supposed to pick up, like,

00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:33.340
their active credit
officers in one spot

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:38.005
and some not-so-active credit
officers in other areas.

00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:53.580
And then the data you know,
this was from May of 1997,

00:38:53.580 --> 00:39:02.860
in this case, when we wrote
this paper, through 2001.

00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:06.370
And I already gave you
the conclusions basically.

00:39:13.062 --> 00:39:17.060
And in fact you're going
to see the equations again

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:19.790
when we get to this
informal, because it's

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:24.320
very similar-looking
no point in repeating.

00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:33.650
So this is what I've been doing
with Cynthia and [? Whit. ?]

00:39:33.650 --> 00:39:37.580
So we have the measured chains
of financial transactions,

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.565
gifts and loans, from
one family to another.

00:39:48.380 --> 00:39:50.810
So we've already
talked about the fact

00:39:50.810 --> 00:39:52.970
that people with
indirect connections who

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.490
are not directly
customers but are

00:39:55.490 --> 00:39:57.890
connected through
other households

00:39:57.890 --> 00:40:00.050
are going to do quite well.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.660
There's a flip side
to that, is we've been

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:07.060
measuring the control group.

00:40:07.060 --> 00:40:11.100
The control group was
an average of people

00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:15.030
who were indirect previously,
indirectly connected or not

00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:16.030
connected at all.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:18.150
And when we separate
that out, we

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:20.340
have the "not connected
at all" people.

00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:24.430
And it turns out they're
actually the most vulnerable.

00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:30.300
So their vulnerability
was being concealed.

00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:35.010
And there's some work in Mexico
that is very, very similar

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:35.850
in spirit.

00:40:35.850 --> 00:40:37.890
The data is a bit
different, so the details

00:40:37.890 --> 00:40:43.200
are a bit different, Andgelucci,
and Rangel, Rasul, and so on.

00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.090
Investment's going to be a
bit of a different story.

00:40:51.090 --> 00:40:53.130
Kin are going to
matter, but it's almost

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:54.735
like an
out-of-equilibrium story.

00:40:59.175 --> 00:41:01.650
Let me come back to that.

00:41:01.650 --> 00:41:03.540
I won't dwell on this slide.

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:06.570
It's just showing you that
there is a lot of borrowing,

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.720
and lending, and gift-giving.

00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:15.580
And when it happens,
it happens typically,

00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:18.440
you know, depending
on which line

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:25.550
you're looking at, three to
five times during a sample.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.750
And the amounts are large.

00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:31.320
The borrowing transaction is
like 60% your monthly income.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:36.340
So you know, take your
student stipend and--

00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:38.190
it's a big number.

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.610
No, I'm not saying your stipend.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:40.600
It's a big percent.

00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:44.450
AUDIENCE: [CHUCKLES]
We would never

00:41:44.450 --> 00:41:46.508
make that misunderstanding
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:41:46.508 --> 00:41:53.320
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
[CHUCKLES] So this

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:55.930
is the equation I was alluding
to that I didn't show you

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:59.280
on the previous paper with Alem.

00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.450
But basically,
first-differenced, we

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:04.270
have the change in
household consumption

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:06.520
in village v at date t.

00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:08.990
This is the change in
the income of household

00:42:08.990 --> 00:42:10.670
i in village v at date t.

00:42:10.670 --> 00:42:13.390
This is the
vulnerability coefficient

00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:18.010
that we're interested in
seeing how big or small it is.

00:42:18.010 --> 00:42:25.720
And then we start interacting
that change in income with

00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:32.200
basically a direct member or
"indirectly-connected," quote,

00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:35.060
member of a financial
institution.

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:43.720
And one hopes that this
might be not trivial,

00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:49.550
but this would be
negative and subtract off

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:52.730
for those who are members,
and customers, and so on.

00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:54.800
K is kinship.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.510
That's also entering--
we're trying

00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:58.790
to distinguish sort
of having family

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:01.880
in the village as opposed to
having measured transactions.

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:02.870
It's a bit heroic.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:06.470
We don't have instruments
for whether you're

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:07.610
in a network or not.

00:43:07.610 --> 00:43:13.850
It's a problem for us and
for a lot of this literature.

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:17.330
And then this is
controlling for net worth.

00:43:17.330 --> 00:43:21.950
I mean, as you've seen from the
previous slides, the relatively

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:26.180
poor people, at least in
India, were more vulnerable.

00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:28.010
So knowing that
a priori, we want

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:32.750
to take that effect out and
control for it, at least

00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:36.070
in this additive way.

00:43:36.070 --> 00:43:38.215
This is the investment equation.

00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.090
It's basically very similar.

00:43:43.090 --> 00:43:44.690
I is just investment.

00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:47.140
It's actually normalized
by the capital stock.

00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:50.020
So it's investment
per unit capital.

00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:52.300
And again, it allows
for the direct effect

00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:55.150
of the income per
unit of capital,

00:43:55.150 --> 00:43:59.860
as well as the direct
and indirect connections.

00:44:03.010 --> 00:44:07.420
I should have highlighted that,
in both of these equations,

00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:14.180
you've got these time-varying
calm and fixed effects.

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:16.700
This is what the theory
is telling us to do.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.990
It's not as though consumption
doesn't move with income.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:23.620
Consumption can move
with this fixed effect.

00:44:23.620 --> 00:44:25.570
I should have also
said, previously,

00:44:25.570 --> 00:44:28.720
with my mention of the
econometric problems

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:30.760
of measuring average
consumption and putting it

00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:32.740
on the right-hand
side, that you can just

00:44:32.740 --> 00:44:36.010
replace that with an
unobserved fixed effect.

00:44:36.010 --> 00:44:39.310
And the theory gives you the
interpretation of what it is.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:44.360
Or you could subtract it all
off from the left-hand side.

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:46.930
And when the
coefficient is 1, that's

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:48.310
also a reasonable thing to do.

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:51.355
Here we're just putting in these
time-varying fixed effects.

00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:02.380
So this is the coefficient
for those people

00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.140
without any access,
direct or indirect.

00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:11.220
This is how much you'd subtract
if you look at direct bank--

00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.880
yes, these are very
similar numbers.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:18.610
I always get accused
of biasing this stuff.

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:21.700
Anyway, so the sum
of these things

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:23.920
is significantly
different from zero.

00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:30.190
And the point is you've
achieved the benchmark standard.

00:45:30.190 --> 00:45:33.280
But equally interesting
is, when you

00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.680
have the indirect connections,
you're subtracting off

00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:38.430
virtually the same number.

00:45:38.430 --> 00:45:40.050
Kin didn't help in this case.

00:45:43.954 --> 00:45:45.906
AUDIENCE: Sorry, is
there a way to augment--

00:45:45.906 --> 00:45:47.281
because we have
direct connection

00:45:47.281 --> 00:45:48.590
and indirect connection.

00:45:48.590 --> 00:45:52.027
Would it help me
more to have both?

00:45:52.027 --> 00:45:53.860
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's
what indirect means.

00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:54.240
Sorry.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:54.580
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:54.920
All right.

00:45:54.920 --> 00:45:55.740
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:55.740 --> 00:45:56.580
It's mislabeled.

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.210
It means both.

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:58.210
AUDIENCE: Oh, all right.

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:00.430
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, good point.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.960
And then this is
with investment.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:05.250
Now, what are the differences?

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:06.630
Well, two, basically.

00:46:06.630 --> 00:46:11.190
First of all, whatever
we're subtracting off,

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:14.310
it doesn't lower
the total to zero.

00:46:14.310 --> 00:46:17.520
And if you tested, there's
still residual vulnerability.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:21.900
So with investment, smoothing
investment against cash flow,

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:25.350
you are left with some
idiosyncratic risk.

00:46:25.350 --> 00:46:32.180
Although kin are quite
helpful, but measured

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.526
transactions are not.

00:46:34.526 --> 00:46:36.880
It's a little too early
to get into this story.

00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.710
Cynthia and I are
still working on it.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:45.580
But the idea is
something like, just

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:50.080
to anticipate when we get
to obstacles to trade,

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:52.900
you can't force someone to
be in a risk-sharing group,

00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:54.340
but they kind of
like being there

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:57.500
because they can smooth
their future income.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.310
So you can't force them,
but they voluntarily

00:47:00.310 --> 00:47:02.440
choose to stay even
though, in any period,

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.180
they have the option to leave.

00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:07.800
It's, like, self-sustaining.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:14.060
With investment-- and this
is above median investment

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:17.680
relative to the capital stock--

00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:19.660
investment is big.

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:24.190
The typical number is like
20% of your physical capital

00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:26.140
when it happens.

00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:29.340
So it's not little,
incremental, teeny-weeny stuff.

00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:34.240
OK, now imagine, say,
someone comes to me

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:35.920
and asks me for a loan--

00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:40.020
I'm the community head, in
case you didn't notice--

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:45.850
and you're going to
put it in your project,

00:47:45.850 --> 00:47:47.770
and it's quite a good project.

00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:50.500
And then, next period,
you got a lot more income

00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:54.760
than you used to, now it's
much more tempting to renege.

00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:57.910
Because you're much better
off in autarky than you

00:47:57.910 --> 00:48:02.180
would have been if you hadn't
gotten the investment done.

00:48:02.180 --> 00:48:09.310
And so the theory is, A, that
either doesn't happen, or B,

00:48:09.310 --> 00:48:13.180
all your relatives come
and do their thing.

00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:18.580
And that's consistent
with these patterns

00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:22.000
when we're working on
numerical estimates.

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:23.042
Yes.

00:48:23.042 --> 00:48:25.600
AUDIENCE: I'm not sure if you
can see this from this data,

00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:29.910
but if I'm talking indirectly,
accessing the financial system,

00:48:29.910 --> 00:48:33.120
is that link between us,
does that person typically

00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.410
have assets on stock,
perhaps, because they

00:48:35.410 --> 00:48:38.478
know people will borrow from
them, and they want to do it?

00:48:38.478 --> 00:48:40.520
Or are they actually just
turning around and then

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:42.680
borrowing the
pharmacist, and then

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.915
being more like an
intermediary for a loan.

00:48:44.915 --> 00:48:47.290
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I'm not sure
exactly what you're asking.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:50.770
[? Whit ?] and I have this--

00:48:50.770 --> 00:48:53.830
somebody will take a
formal-sector loan.

00:48:53.830 --> 00:48:54.850
Then it's due.

00:48:54.850 --> 00:48:57.290
And they're not doing
too well in that year.

00:48:57.290 --> 00:49:00.340
So they will turn around and
get an informal short-term loan

00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:03.100
from a friend, or
relative, or money lender,

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:04.780
pay off the long-term
loan, and then

00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:06.730
with the proceeds of
the long-term loan, they

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:08.240
pay off the short-term loan.

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.350
AUDIENCE: And that friend
or relative, should I--

00:49:10.350 --> 00:49:12.892
maybe the answer is it's both--
should I think of that person

00:49:12.892 --> 00:49:16.521
as having money lying
around to be ready to lend

00:49:16.521 --> 00:49:21.070
to their friend who needs
it, or did they intend to--

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:22.650
AUDIENCE: They
can also take it--

00:49:22.650 --> 00:49:23.975
there could be a lot of shame.

00:49:23.975 --> 00:49:26.350
And they could also get it
from the financial institution

00:49:26.350 --> 00:49:28.160
themself if they're
a normal guy.

00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:30.660
But there is some people who
are acting as money lender,

00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:32.860
and they have money
ready [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:34.298
So it depends on the person.

00:49:34.298 --> 00:49:36.340
If it's a relative, mostly
they're not that rich.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.362
So they'd probably borrow.

00:49:38.362 --> 00:49:39.820
AUDIENCE: I guess
I'm just speaking

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:42.540
of one of the things the
portfolios and the [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:45.160
book, is that people will
simultaneously borrow and save

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:46.380
at the same time.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:49.785
And maybe this fits in,
if part of the reason

00:49:49.785 --> 00:49:52.970
I have that savings is because
I might need to lend it out

00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:55.050
at short notice to somebody.

00:49:55.050 --> 00:49:56.200
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:58.330
So there are all kinds
of financial strategies.

00:49:58.330 --> 00:50:01.420
You know, savings and borrowing
gets pretty complicated.

00:50:01.420 --> 00:50:03.370
Because even if you get
a loan, then the way

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:05.110
you get the loan
proceeds is someone

00:50:05.110 --> 00:50:06.460
opens up a savings account.

00:50:06.460 --> 00:50:09.460
You don't necessarily
withdraw it right away.

00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:12.400
So that's one mechanical
reason to get that.

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:15.520
But loans can be long term.

00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:17.800
And then you have a
liquidity problem.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:19.330
And you don't call in the loan.

00:50:19.330 --> 00:50:25.510
So you might want to keep
savings to balance that risk.

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:27.250
I mean, this is like
the bread and butter

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:28.953
of a lot of things
people do in macro

00:50:28.953 --> 00:50:30.370
when they're looking
at investment

00:50:30.370 --> 00:50:33.140
and trying to sort all that out.

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:37.780
Yep.

00:50:37.780 --> 00:50:41.011
AUDIENCE: Why [INAUDIBLE]
smallest investment?

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:47.090
ROBERT TOWNSEND: They want
to undertake the investment

00:50:47.090 --> 00:50:49.340
when they have an opportunity.

00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.010
And they may not
be able to do it,

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:53.720
or they may have
to wait to do it

00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:56.720
until they have the liquidity.

00:50:56.720 --> 00:50:58.000
And that's costly.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.510
AUDIENCE: But [INAUDIBLE]
differentiate [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:02.350
tp avoid two cases.

00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:05.930
The first one is that there
is insufficient insurance,

00:51:05.930 --> 00:51:07.760
so I cannot borrow
money from the bank.

00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.090
The second one is that I
[? just ?] [? want ?] to invest

00:51:11.090 --> 00:51:15.100
because productivity
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:19.460
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, so we'll
get to this structural model

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:25.430
of village funds, which takes
a stand on the process that

00:51:25.430 --> 00:51:27.110
generate shocks.

00:51:27.110 --> 00:51:29.000
And then we have to
take the data, and kind

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.430
of estimate that process.

00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:37.590
And then that model allows the--

00:51:37.590 --> 00:51:39.890
and then you get these
investment opportunities

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:44.430
which are like random variables,
large, chunky opportunities.

00:51:44.430 --> 00:51:49.610
AUDIENCE: Here we assume that
we don't have to differentiate

00:51:49.610 --> 00:51:51.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:51:51.570 --> 00:51:53.400
ROBERT TOWNSEND: This
is reduced form--

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.743
I mean, here, I was talking
about a model just then.

00:51:56.743 --> 00:51:59.160
But we're not quite ready in
the class, because we haven't

00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.820
really explicitly written
down these obstacles,

00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.200
neither the moral hazard
or the limited commitment.

00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:09.530
So I was talking you
through it like what next.

00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:11.870
But actually this is
just reduced-form stuff.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:13.595
It doesn't really tell you.

00:52:13.595 --> 00:52:18.380
But we're telling a story which
I think is reasonably accurate.

00:52:18.380 --> 00:52:20.270
But Cynthia and I are
writing down a model,

00:52:20.270 --> 00:52:22.280
and trying to
numerically compute

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:26.630
it to see if it's
a reasonable story.

00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:34.690
This is what I said in words.

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:36.460
And then this is
the Mexican paper.

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:42.580
So it has to do with Progresa.

00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:46.010
And they have
treatment and control.

00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:49.550
And the details are
a bit different.

00:52:49.550 --> 00:52:53.170
But I think you
have these slides.

00:52:53.170 --> 00:52:56.450
And there's only like
four or five of them.

00:52:56.450 --> 00:53:02.670
But I will just say, then,
it's not just about Thailand,

00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:04.890
and we're not the
only one doing this.

00:53:04.890 --> 00:53:06.770
Networks is a really hot topic.

00:53:06.770 --> 00:53:10.090
Everybody wants to play
around with networks.

00:53:10.090 --> 00:53:14.760
Esther and [? Arun ?] have
pretty good network data

00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:15.600
in parts of India.

00:53:21.870 --> 00:53:25.950
So one example
probably is enough.

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:30.390
Now, I said something about
well-intended interventions

00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:32.580
causing losses.

00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:43.160
This is some joint
work We first of all do

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:46.020
estimate heterogeneity
and risk preferences.

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:53.240
And then the idea, splicing
together these papers,

00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:55.340
it's like village India.

00:53:55.340 --> 00:53:58.040
So there's aggregate
village level risk that's

00:53:58.040 --> 00:54:00.920
not necessarily shared very--

00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:04.160
which you have to control for,
and it's not "shared," quote,

00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:06.650
unquote--

00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:08.810
let me say it again.

00:54:08.810 --> 00:54:10.790
You've got all the
idiosyncratic stuff

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:12.620
going on within the village.

00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:16.580
So it's as if almost
complete markets there.

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:22.420
Then you village-level risk,
which is aggregate risk.

00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:25.660
And then someone comes
in ostensibly trying

00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:28.390
to insure that aggregate risk.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:30.730
So you would think, oh great,
they're already covered

00:54:30.730 --> 00:54:33.070
on the idiosyncratic side.

00:54:33.070 --> 00:54:34.960
Now someone else can
come in and cover them

00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:37.160
on the aggregate side.

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.900
Must be a good thing.

00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:42.810
And the answer is, well,
no, not necessarily.

00:54:42.810 --> 00:54:45.720
I've already basically
given this away.

00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.390
Because you have
risk-tolerant people

00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:51.120
in the village who were
willing to underwrite

00:54:51.120 --> 00:54:53.410
that aggregate risk.

00:54:53.410 --> 00:54:57.280
And it shows up in higher
levels of consumption for them,

00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:58.900
on average.

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:01.480
It's not as though
people wrote a check,

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.750
and you got the premium.

00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:05.960
But it's showing up,
in whatever mechanism

00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:11.010
it is, in the give-and-take
with informal transactions

00:55:11.010 --> 00:55:12.960
and so on.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:26.040
So to see how
we're estimating it

00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:32.760
and get some intuition for how
we estimate the risk aversion,

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.600
if two households had more
or less the same coefficient

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.610
of risk tolerance,
then their consumption

00:55:38.610 --> 00:55:41.760
should more or
less move together.

00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.300
But the opposite, if one were
very almost risk-neutral,

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:50.580
and the other very risk-averse,
then, practically, consumption

00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:54.600
is almost smooth
for the risk-averse

00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:58.290
guy by virtue of
the risk-neutral guy

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:00.480
underwriting that risk.

00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:05.250
So you can imagine-- and
people have done this--

00:56:05.250 --> 00:56:07.860
looking at households
pairwise, and just

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:10.470
trying to see how many
consumption reversals there

00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:11.730
are, and things.

00:56:11.730 --> 00:56:12.990
We don't quite do that.

00:56:12.990 --> 00:56:15.930
We don't have enough data.

00:56:15.930 --> 00:56:18.750
And I'm not sure it's very
effective econometrically.

00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:24.510
We do take a household, j, take
their measure of co-movement,

00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:27.480
essentially, compared to
the co-movements of all

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.200
the other households.

00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.600
So it's always j,
less time, compared

00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:33.600
with all the other ones.

00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.670
Well, it's probably easier
to do it with the notation.

00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:41.190
So here is that basic
first-order condition.

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:44.010
With constant relative
risk-aversion, by the way,

00:56:44.010 --> 00:56:47.610
it's in logs, not levels.

00:56:47.610 --> 00:56:48.930
But it's the same idea.

00:56:48.930 --> 00:56:51.240
You've got the Pareto weight.

00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:56.340
We're actually going to allow
differences in discount rates

00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.480
across households.

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.830
And so that sends
sets up a trend,

00:57:01.830 --> 00:57:06.740
where some people are going up
and some people are going down

00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:07.800
long term.

00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:09.720
We allow preference shocks--

00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:14.550
actually monthly shocks, because
there are holidays and things.

00:57:14.550 --> 00:57:17.790
So the idea is to put as many
controls in, in some sense,

00:57:17.790 --> 00:57:19.680
that the theory would allow.

00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:24.660
And then we have this sort
of common fixed effect.

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:30.300
And note in particular
that actually everything,

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:33.210
but in particular this
thing, is normalized

00:57:33.210 --> 00:57:41.110
by basically the risk aversion.

00:57:41.110 --> 00:57:45.760
If risk aversion is really high,
this coefficient is really low,

00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.850
and so that household's
not moving around

00:57:48.850 --> 00:57:50.117
with the aggregate.

00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:59.730
So basically-- sorry--
almost what we're doing

00:57:59.730 --> 00:58:02.430
is taking consumption,
regressing it

00:58:02.430 --> 00:58:05.850
against trends, and
monthly effects,

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:10.800
and household fixed effects,
and getting a residual.

00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:13.260
The residual is
capturing all of this--

00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:17.660
call it v or eta, and
then just sort of see.

00:58:17.660 --> 00:58:21.900
What the correlation
is between a household

00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:27.510
i's residual, which is a
stand-in for that aggregate

00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:31.560
that's moving consumption, and
any other household's i-prime.

00:58:34.130 --> 00:58:36.990
So this is like a
moment, basically.

00:58:36.990 --> 00:58:41.150
And we can use
method of moments,

00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:44.670
in principle, for all
the households, pairwise.

00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:47.850
But we didn't have
enough data for that,

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.870
even though we have a lot of
households and a lot of months.

00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:53.960
So we just summed that we have
household i's risk tolerance--

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.020
essentially what this
thing turns out to be

00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:00.680
is household i's risk
tolerance times the sum

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:06.200
of the risk toleri of the other
households in the village.

00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.090
But hopefully you're
getting some intuition

00:59:08.090 --> 00:59:12.515
for where we're getting
the risk aversion measures.

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:21.590
This, I think, you
can ignore today.

00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:25.460
It has to do with whether or
not the conventional regressions

00:59:25.460 --> 00:59:31.460
that ignored heterogeneity
are biased in some way.

00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.590
And early work--
actually Sam's work--

00:59:33.590 --> 00:59:41.260
suggested that it's even harder
to reject full risk-sharing

00:59:41.260 --> 00:59:44.770
if you allow for
the heterogeneity.

00:59:44.770 --> 00:59:48.460
Or it could seem that you're
rejecting full risk-sharing

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:51.850
when you assume homogeneity,
because you haven't allowed

00:59:51.850 --> 00:59:54.220
this asymmetric
adjustment that's

00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:56.530
possible on the
part of households,

00:59:56.530 --> 00:59:58.970
depending on their
risk tolerance.

00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:03.730
And that's all I want to say,
probably even false intuition.

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:06.250
Because it may not
be true in general.

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:15.910
But then you kind of want
to measure welfare gains.

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:17.830
OK, so how much
would a household

01:00:17.830 --> 01:00:22.960
be willing to pay living
in a risky situation

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.640
to remove that risk.

01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:29.830
In other words, what fraction
of average consumption would

01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:33.220
they be willing to take a
hit on and live in a world

01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:36.700
without the risk, as
opposed to the world

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.190
that they're currently in.

01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:41.740
Or how much would they be
willing to pay for someone

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:45.310
to come in as an outsider
targeting insurance

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:47.155
against, say, rainfall?

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.340
Lucas did this with
business cycles.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:01:00.610
So this number, k, which
is the fraction you're

01:01:00.610 --> 01:01:03.460
willing to give up, if
positive means that you

01:01:03.460 --> 01:01:07.810
gain from eliminating
aggregate risk, but k

01:01:07.810 --> 01:01:09.670
can actually turn
out to be negative.

01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:12.020
Here is an expression for it.

01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:16.380
Suffice it to say that it has
to do with the risk tolerance.

01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:31.790
And although this slide is a bit
tiny, village by village, this

01:01:31.790 --> 01:01:33.690
is 0.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.520
So basically we're
lining up the households

01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.510
by their degree of tolerance,
from very risk-averse to not

01:01:42.510 --> 01:01:43.860
very.

01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:46.170
And these are
downward-sloping lines.

01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:57.040
So basically the higher this
risk tolerance, the more likely

01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:02.230
it is that this k or this
welfare gain is negative.

01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:03.930
So it's not trivial.

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:06.730
And by the way, it's not
correlated with characteristics

01:02:06.730 --> 01:02:07.590
either.

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:09.410
You say, oh, it's
the rich people.

01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:11.430
No, that's wrong.

01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:16.210
Risk aversion is not
correlated with wealth.

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:21.042
It's as if complete
markets, remember?

01:02:21.042 --> 01:02:23.500
AUDIENCE: Could it be due to
[INAUDIBLE] within the village

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.900
[INAUDIBLE] institutions.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:30.180
So two equally risk-averse
people, but one [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:32.280
so they [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.250
ROBERT TOWNSEND: We actually
initially did this just

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:38.190
on the network
households, because I

01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:40.530
was worried about having
the non-network households

01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:42.930
in there.

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:46.020
Although when we actually
run the full test now,

01:02:46.020 --> 01:02:48.780
for risk-sharing, taking into
account the heterogeneity,

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.410
we don't reject either.

01:02:52.410 --> 01:02:53.700
I don't totally believe it.

01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:56.220
I still think there are
relatively poor people who tend

01:02:56.220 --> 01:02:58.200
to be a little more vulnerable.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.330
But somehow, with all
this heterogeneity,

01:03:00.330 --> 01:03:04.560
it's not showing up the
way I would have thought.

01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:07.484
It's not soundly
rejecting full insurance.

01:03:07.484 --> 01:03:09.276
AUDIENCE: From the
data, can you see, then,

01:03:09.276 --> 01:03:13.608
if the risk tolerance
is greater amongst--

01:03:13.608 --> 01:03:16.150
is there a distinction between
risk tolerance and [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:19.500
network [INAUDIBLE]?

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.940
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Oh, I'm not sure we

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:26.390
have enough non-network
households to do it.

01:03:26.390 --> 01:03:28.640
But the counter to that
is that we certainly

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:31.860
had enough in network with
Cynthia to find something.

01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:33.700
So it's probably worth trying.

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:35.700
I haven't done it yet.

01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:38.990
Yeah, the worry here is that
we've left something out.

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:42.260
The model is just making a
lot of strong assumptions

01:03:42.260 --> 01:03:45.140
that there's no alternatives.

01:03:45.140 --> 01:03:46.640
To try to say it
in words, we're not

01:03:46.640 --> 01:03:48.680
looking at some indirect
utility function.

01:03:48.680 --> 01:03:51.490
We're looking at the
direct utility function.

01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:54.815
And indirect might be there if
they have other ways of coping.

01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:00.410
When we get to labor
supply, we will

01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:03.650
be quite explicit
about supplying labor

01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:06.880
as a way to cope with risk, and
then revisit these equations.

01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:21.310
So people have--

01:04:21.310 --> 01:04:26.200
I have, too-- offered insurance
products like rainfall

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.840
insurance in India.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.220
We haven't quite done
it yet in Thailand.

01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:36.550
And I'll tell you why we
have misgivings about it,

01:04:36.550 --> 01:04:37.690
and some of the puzzles.

01:04:37.690 --> 01:04:42.480
But basically with less of an
exception in Ghana and Chris

01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.940
Udry, with Dean,
most experiments

01:04:45.940 --> 01:04:48.370
in the world, the take-up
of these insurance products

01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:49.450
is pretty low.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:53.800
Or in our case, in India,
people will insure one plot,

01:04:53.800 --> 01:04:56.890
and not insure the other
plots that they own.

01:04:56.890 --> 01:05:01.270
So you know, it's
not totally terrible.

01:05:01.270 --> 01:05:03.160
There is some price elasticity.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:05.680
But there are puzzles.

01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:08.710
I mean, if people are so
poor and so vulnerable,

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:10.330
then why aren't
taking it up more?

01:05:10.330 --> 01:05:15.150
Now, one answer you
may have already seen.

01:05:15.150 --> 01:05:18.850
They don't really need it.

01:05:18.850 --> 01:05:20.858
Because even if they're
somewhat vulnerable,

01:05:20.858 --> 01:05:22.900
there are people in the
village willing to assume

01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:23.930
some of that risk.

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:27.250
And even if it isn't perfect,
at the end of the day, given

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:30.220
the way the policies
are priced, maybe you're

01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:32.470
just not going to
see that take-up.

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:35.320
Unfortunately-- and people
aren't either taking

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:40.480
the time to get baseline data
or don't bother with it at all.

01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:44.470
They just go in
there with an RCT.

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:46.490
Well, we did.

01:05:46.490 --> 01:05:47.060
Yeah.

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.246
AUDIENCE: So is that
just rainfall insurance?

01:05:50.246 --> 01:05:51.670
Or any kinds of insurance?

01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:53.860
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Could be anything.

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.930
I'm going to focus on
rainfall as just a way

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:57.280
to give it a label.

01:05:57.280 --> 01:06:00.380
Could be any kind
of weather risk.

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:03.880
It could actually be price risk.

01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:07.510
Case-Shiller index in the
US is about price risk.

01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:09.640
It wasn't just to
measure housing prices

01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:12.460
to get his name in The Wall
Street Journal every month.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:17.230
It was originally designed
because Bob Shiller had spent

01:06:17.230 --> 01:06:21.880
years creating a risk
instrument which he was trying

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:24.790
to promote on Wall Street.

01:06:24.790 --> 01:06:26.510
So yeah, so it could be--

01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:28.450
and in urban areas,
maybe it is more

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:34.090
likely to be vulnerability to
price rather than rainfall.

01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:37.420
So rainfall here is kind
of like, partly, a metaphor

01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.770
for the problem in general.

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:41.680
But I'll come back
with a vengeance

01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:45.196
to look at rainfall in
these Thai villages.

01:06:45.196 --> 01:06:48.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
even summer and winter,

01:06:48.650 --> 01:06:52.783
they say that rain
affects [INAUDIBLE]..

01:06:52.783 --> 01:06:53.700
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:57.660
People don't come and buy
when it's raining, and so on.

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:01.650
But you came up with a situation
where it was actually good.

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.150
Just trying to
remember what it was.

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:04.530
AUDIENCE: I think
we said, umbrellas.

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:06.322
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
something like that.

01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:17.690
OK, so here's the vengeance
paper with Kamilya.

01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:19.850
So this is all about rain.

01:07:19.850 --> 01:07:29.270
So we want to see the effect
of rain on rice production.

01:07:29.270 --> 01:07:31.940
Now again, the typical
thing that you'll

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:33.440
see in the
development literature

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:36.470
is rainfall is the risk.

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:39.560
Let's just sort of instrument
the relevant variable

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:43.340
by rainfall, and then
start looking at migration

01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.918
and all kinds of stuff.

01:07:44.918 --> 01:07:46.460
So here, the idea
is, let's just look

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:50.110
at rainfall in the village,
start instrumenting income

01:07:50.110 --> 01:07:53.900
or rice production by
rainfall, and then look

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:58.790
at the vulnerability
of consumption

01:07:58.790 --> 01:08:04.470
to instrumented income,
which people do, a lot.

01:08:04.470 --> 01:08:08.800
Now, it's going to
turn out that things

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.500
are more complicated than
that within the village.

01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:12.670
The soil is different.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:15.220
The hydrology and water
flow are different.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:20.069
They actually plant
at different times.

01:08:20.069 --> 01:08:25.050
So a common rainfall shock,
even if it is actually common,

01:08:25.050 --> 01:08:28.770
and shows up and all the
rain gauges which we have,

01:08:28.770 --> 01:08:31.740
it's still the case that
it has differential impact

01:08:31.740 --> 01:08:36.990
on the households, especially
depending on when they plant,

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:42.350
which is in turn a
function of soil and so on.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:44.859
So what are Kamilya and I doing?

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:48.069
We're going to estimate
a three-stage production

01:08:48.069 --> 01:08:54.550
function which takes into
account the sequential nature.

01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:55.990
There's planting, for sure.

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:59.680
And then you have sort of
the germination period,

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:01.810
and the planting of
the rice, and so on,

01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:03.729
with maybe some
fertilizing and so on.

01:09:03.729 --> 01:09:05.925
Then you've got
sort of midseason,

01:09:05.925 --> 01:09:07.300
and all the stuff
you need to do.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.615
And then you finally
approach and include harvest.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:20.960
You know, I'm going to jump,
and just show you the notation.

01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:29.920
So here basically is stage
I, with predecessor stages I

01:09:29.920 --> 01:09:30.609
minus 1.

01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:36.250
It's going to be looking
forward to future stages

01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:38.870
if you're not at the last one.

01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:43.160
So if you're at the last one,
this would be the harvest.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.560
That's the easiest
thing to think about.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.569
If you're in the
next-to-last one,

01:09:47.569 --> 01:09:51.020
the output is
basically the condition

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.410
of the crop prior to harvest.

01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:58.040
And what influences that?

01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:00.120
Well, if you've got
land, labor, capital,

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:04.850
and so on, as Cobb-Douglas
type inputs in the production

01:10:04.850 --> 01:10:08.300
function--

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:14.370
but you've also got the
state of the crop plot

01:10:14.370 --> 01:10:18.790
that you inherited from
the previous stage.

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:21.130
And then all of this gets
hit, at the end of the period,

01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:24.565
with more shocks,
including rain, and so on,

01:10:24.565 --> 01:10:27.210
and temperature.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:30.870
So this is not a Cobb-Douglas.

01:10:30.870 --> 01:10:36.510
It's a CES that allows
some substitutability

01:10:36.510 --> 01:10:40.080
to be estimated between
the current state

01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:43.930
and contemporaneous inputs.

01:10:47.800 --> 01:10:50.890
It may not be as
extreme as Leontief.

01:10:50.890 --> 01:10:54.070
So you're kind of doomed by
the state of the crop plot

01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:56.620
at this time,
based on everything

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.990
that happened in the past.

01:10:58.990 --> 01:11:01.660
And then you just have to
adjust inputs in proportion.

01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:04.240
Doesn't have to be that
bad, but it turns out

01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:06.263
not to be like Cobb-Douglas.

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:07.930
If you want to think
about Cobb-Douglas,

01:11:07.930 --> 01:11:10.410
there's a whole lot
of substitutability--

01:11:10.410 --> 01:11:12.055
labor today, labor tomorrow.

01:11:12.055 --> 01:11:13.750
Oh, it's not that
much of a difference.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:17.230
Why don't we wait and figure
out what the rainfall is first,

01:11:17.230 --> 01:11:20.820
and then adjust
the inputs later?

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:24.465
So this allows us to estimate
the ability to adjust.

01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:29.660
And essentially the
reason you can't

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:33.200
use rain, aggregated up
over the whole season,

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.840
is because of this
imperfect substitutability

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.710
across the stages.

01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:40.078
Yep.

01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:43.420
AUDIENCE: It says
that it introduces--

01:11:43.420 --> 01:11:46.000
[INAUDIBLE] that
[INAUDIBLE] induces

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.462
people to plant at different
times, for example.

01:11:48.462 --> 01:11:50.170
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No,
that's not in there.

01:11:50.170 --> 01:11:53.650
There's a separate equation
that has to do-- like a probit,

01:11:53.650 --> 01:11:57.310
basically, which determines
planting times as we see it

01:11:57.310 --> 01:11:58.000
in the data.

01:12:05.970 --> 01:12:16.870
So we can look at the effect
of rainfall on rice production.

01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:20.520
And we can actually do
something with climate change.

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:23.430
Let me show you this thing.

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:32.020
So this black thing
here is the distribution

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:35.290
of actual yields
across households--

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:42.710
and actually it's
households and time.

01:12:45.540 --> 01:12:55.340
This peak thing is just
using a weather index.

01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:57.860
So you regress yields--

01:12:57.860 --> 01:13:02.750
same data, our data, onto
temperature and rainfall,

01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:04.760
and a whole suite of
them, a big, long vector.

01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:07.420
It doesn't have to be,
narrowly, rainfall.

01:13:07.420 --> 01:13:10.510
Try to be as
realistic as possible.

01:13:10.510 --> 01:13:12.250
And then you run a regression.

01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:15.370
And then you get basically
the predicted through the lens

01:13:15.370 --> 01:13:20.570
of that weather index model.

01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.040
And it's close.

01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:23.370
It's very, very peaked.

01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:28.250
Well, sorry, that's
the first thing.

01:13:28.250 --> 01:13:31.350
Then this thing is
using the full model--

01:13:31.350 --> 01:13:34.610
sorry, using the model, but only
the observed rainfall variable,

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:37.760
and setting everything else at
their sample average-- common

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:42.110
soil, common fertilizer.

01:13:42.110 --> 01:13:47.120
And then the big jump
down here toward the data

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:50.600
is when you start to allow the
variation that the model has

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:56.850
in it, certainly soil variation,
and eventually full variation.

01:13:56.850 --> 01:14:01.580
So we're not one to one with
the actual distribution,

01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:03.980
but we've made a
substantial improvement

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.440
from simple weather indices.

01:14:12.310 --> 01:14:15.910
So people talk about basis risk.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:18.400
And what they mean
typically is the reason

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.500
there's not take-up of
a rainfall insurance

01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:24.340
product is because the rain
gauge is way out there,

01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:29.620
so distant that the correlation
of the rainfall at the gauge

01:14:29.620 --> 01:14:33.880
with the correlation of the
rainfall in the village is low.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.450
In fact, the Bank for
Agriculture introduced--

01:14:37.450 --> 01:14:40.150
I guess it's now
three years ago--

01:14:40.150 --> 01:14:43.460
an index product.

01:14:43.460 --> 01:14:46.270
And they already restricted
it to be something

01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:48.580
like 20, 25 kilometers.

01:14:48.580 --> 01:14:51.010
And the take-up was terrible.

01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:54.340
So then they said, oh,
we know, it's basis risk.

01:14:54.340 --> 01:14:57.460
So then they went down
to something like 15,

01:14:57.460 --> 01:14:59.860
lowered the radius.

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:01.760
And take-up was
still pretty bad.

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.177
And I think they're going to
have to withdraw the product.

01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.780
So this is a kind of basis risk.

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:12.270
What we're saying
is, even though we're

01:15:12.270 --> 01:15:14.580
sitting on top of
the rainfall gauge,

01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:17.100
within the village, the
way that that rainfall

01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:22.710
is impacting these farmers is
different across the farmers.

01:15:22.710 --> 01:15:27.630
So we're busy sort of thinking
about designing, still,

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:31.230
a rainfall product, but
trying to take into account

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:32.320
this heterogeneity.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:32.820
Yes.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.112
AUDIENCE: Maybe this is kind
of what you're getting at,

01:15:35.112 --> 01:15:38.540
[INAUDIBLE] how flexible is the
sort of payout structure given?

01:15:38.540 --> 01:15:40.623
I'm just trying to-- because
it seems like there's

01:15:40.623 --> 01:15:42.340
kind of like, a [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:46.210
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, so
let me show you Kapphan's--

01:15:48.850 --> 01:15:50.500
her dissertation.

01:15:58.710 --> 01:16:01.467
So here's her idea,
which is basically--

01:16:01.467 --> 01:16:03.050
and this is typical
of the literature.

01:16:03.050 --> 01:16:05.090
She did better than most.

01:16:05.090 --> 01:16:09.530
You have a utility
function over consumption.

01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:12.830
Consumption would
be autarky income.

01:16:12.830 --> 01:16:14.210
But you have a payout--

01:16:14.210 --> 01:16:16.640
could be positive or negative.

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:20.720
And that's a function of
this weather index, z.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:23.210
So this is supposed
to be smoothing.

01:16:23.210 --> 01:16:26.600
And this is an optimal
design problem.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.472
It's output conditioned
on the weather index,

01:16:29.472 --> 01:16:31.430
and then the distribution
of the weather index.

01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:33.305
By the way, where is
she getting all of this?

01:16:33.305 --> 01:16:35.480
She's doing it in the lab.

01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:38.690
She's basically simulated
millet production

01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.460
in Switzerland or something.

01:16:40.460 --> 01:16:44.540
But she's not out looking
at the actual crops.

01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.605
AUDIENCE: Is that
[INAUDIBLE] soil?

01:16:46.605 --> 01:16:47.480
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Hmm?

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:50.040
AUDIENCE: Is it
[INAUDIBLE] soil?

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:51.800
ROBERT TOWNSEND: I
don't remember exactly.

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.960
But that is a big
problem in practice

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.140
when you take these sort
of lab-type experiments.

01:16:57.140 --> 01:17:00.670
I forgot to say, we actually
use a crop grow model as well.

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:02.660
It's called DSSAT.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:08.060
And we carefully feed in soil
depth and soil into that model

01:17:08.060 --> 01:17:09.380
I just showed you.

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.590
But to address
your question, sort

01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:15.960
of optimized over this thing,
this is the policy design.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.380
This is the optimal
contract design problem.

01:17:18.380 --> 01:17:19.660
How cool.

01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.970
I mean, it really is cool.

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:28.110
And you know, you can see,
in her simulated data,

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:30.360
the distribution of
yields for any index.

01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:36.960
And then here's the
optimized payout,

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:42.270
which is basically positive,
definitely non-linear.

01:17:42.270 --> 01:17:45.220
And basically it's
like [WHOOSHING NOISE]..

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:48.630
And many of the products that
people already came up with

01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:54.630
are like these kind of
linear, flat schedules.

01:17:54.630 --> 01:17:57.900
This has more wiggles, and
it's more non-linear than that.

01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.650
But this is all
negative territory.

01:17:59.650 --> 01:18:02.470
This is basically
ex-post premia down here.

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:03.270
Yes.

01:18:03.270 --> 01:18:05.590
AUDIENCE: So these
[INAUDIBLE] models,

01:18:05.590 --> 01:18:08.390
do they try to account for
price changes that also result

01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:10.360
from aggregate weather shocks?

01:18:10.360 --> 01:18:10.860
[INAUDIBLE]

01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:10.980
ROBERT TOWNSEND: No.

01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:13.322
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
everybody [INAUDIBLE]..

01:18:13.322 --> 01:18:15.530
Because that could push it
in the opposite direction.

01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:18.590
AUDIENCE: Yes, absolutely.

01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:21.160
And I couldn't agree more.

01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.660
Now, at some level, you've
got to either use data

01:18:23.660 --> 01:18:26.840
to decide how price is moving--

01:18:26.840 --> 01:18:28.690
that's a good starting point--

01:18:28.690 --> 01:18:33.230
and/or incorporate in your
model like we saw with the macro

01:18:33.230 --> 01:18:34.880
development models,
the movements

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:39.270
of wages and interest rates
and so on with interventions.

01:18:39.270 --> 01:18:44.280
So you don't have to
do just one thing,

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:47.400
but you're right-- you need
to take it into account.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:50.592
In Thailand, rice is
the dominant crop.

01:18:50.592 --> 01:18:52.800
It's pretty hard to argue
that like the price of rice

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:54.960
in the village is a
function of village or even

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.475
necessarily regional rainfall.

01:19:00.595 --> 01:19:02.762
AUDIENCE: It would have to
be a pretty big aggregate

01:19:02.762 --> 01:19:03.873
[INAUDIBLE] price.

01:19:03.873 --> 01:19:04.790
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:16.730
So we want to do something
like that, that optimal design,

01:19:16.730 --> 01:19:18.500
to take into account
what we've learned

01:19:18.500 --> 01:19:22.190
about within-village insurance,
and their heterogeneity,

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:24.230
and so on.

01:19:24.230 --> 01:19:27.770
Just two comments--
first of all,

01:19:27.770 --> 01:19:30.310
is it true that
within-village stuff is great

01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:33.830
and across-village stuff is not?

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:36.470
Well, in Thailand it's
not obvious at all.

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:38.180
And in Hong's helped with this.

01:19:38.180 --> 01:19:40.250
We updated some earlier results.

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:43.190
But basically this
section of the slides,

01:19:43.190 --> 01:19:45.770
which I won't
attempt to go over,

01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:49.920
is how to test not only within
villages but across villages.

01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.040
And then you can aggregate
it up, villages, and test

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:57.480
one county versus another.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:01.940
So you have you have layered
sort of degrees of aggregation.

01:20:01.940 --> 01:20:07.610
And you can use [INAUDIBLE]
method-- she did it in Kenya--

01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:11.120
to see how good the insurance
is across the villages.

01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:15.260
And in Thailand it's hard to
say that it's worse than what's

01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:17.660
going on within the village.

01:20:17.660 --> 01:20:21.260
So it's just
massive remittances.

01:20:21.260 --> 01:20:25.160
There's just huge
financial flows coming in,

01:20:25.160 --> 01:20:28.400
which we pick up in
the transactions data.

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:37.520
So I still have misgivings
about pushing too hard on this.

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.690
I'm sort of torn.

01:20:39.690 --> 01:20:43.350
I'm torn by the attractiveness
of designing the intervention

01:20:43.350 --> 01:20:46.680
based on the data, and yet
worried that they really don't

01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:48.900
need this rainfall product.

01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:55.910
And the other thing I want
to just point to so you can--

01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:58.790
sorry, Hong, all your
great stuff here--

01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:06.440
is to say that Chris Udry,
with Dean and co-authors,

01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:12.800
have been doing stuff
in Ghana, and they

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.180
have various treatments.

01:21:14.180 --> 01:21:16.940
They have rainfall insurance.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.210
They have credit.

01:21:19.210 --> 01:21:20.270
They have both.

01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:21.610
They have one and the other.

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.530
They have controls.

01:21:23.530 --> 01:21:26.110
And then you see stuff.

01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:28.300
Like you see
sometimes that credit

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.760
seems to increase investment.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:36.610
But you also see that the
combination of insurance

01:21:36.610 --> 01:21:42.300
and credit is actually not
helping, although insurance

01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:44.640
alone actually can help.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.380
So they wrote down a model,
a simple two-period model,

01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:52.380
which is clear about the
optimization problem.

01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:54.120
And it's similar
in spirit to what

01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:56.100
we're talking about
today, which is what's

01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.160
the shadow price of current
consumption, what's the shadow

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:01.170
price of future consumption.

01:22:01.170 --> 01:22:03.540
If there is full insurance--
which they assume

01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:04.722
in the village--

01:22:04.722 --> 01:22:06.180
and there are no
aggregate shocks--

01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:08.360
which they assume in the model--

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:13.590
then basically you can get
counterintuitive effects going

01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:17.670
on when you offer insurance.

01:22:17.670 --> 01:22:19.530
Because insurance
moves tomorrow, it

01:22:19.530 --> 01:22:22.080
makes tomorrow kind of less
valuable in some sense.

01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.410
It actually seems to
undercut investment today.

01:22:25.410 --> 01:22:31.020
And these other papers are again
treatments, RCTs and so on.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:38.570
It's easy to get lost in
the details of these things,

01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:41.510
and get caught up with
the language of take-up,

01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:46.010
and behavioral responses, and
some very real things that

01:22:46.010 --> 01:22:47.480
are out there.

01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.290
But it's important
not to get lost,

01:22:51.290 --> 01:22:54.290
and to remember the
basic sort of framework

01:22:54.290 --> 01:22:57.530
that you're taking
in if you choose

01:22:57.530 --> 01:23:03.010
to design one of these
randomized control trials.

01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:05.030
Or let me put it another way.

01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:09.380
If Udry had not been thinking
about those kinds of models,

01:23:09.380 --> 01:23:12.440
he would be left with some
very strange puzzles that

01:23:12.440 --> 01:23:14.670
does beg for an interpretation.

01:23:14.670 --> 01:23:16.280
But even better
yet, when you have

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:19.610
the model and the structure,
ideally, with enough data,

01:23:19.610 --> 01:23:21.740
you can actually
design interventions

01:23:21.740 --> 01:23:25.730
which are informative about
key parameters in the model

01:23:25.730 --> 01:23:30.520
and your guesses
about basic obstacles.

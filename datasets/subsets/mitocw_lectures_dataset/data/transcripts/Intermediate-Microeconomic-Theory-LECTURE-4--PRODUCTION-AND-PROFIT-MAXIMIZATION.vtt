00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:13.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Hi,
Professor Townsend.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.610 align:middle line:84%
Can I ask a question
about the income factor

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.700 align:middle line:90%
on the Slutsky equation?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.350 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.690 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I noticed that
in the last lecture slides,

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:35.230 align:middle line:84%
the income factor, you'll note
that it was x multiply data x

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.660 align:middle line:90%
over [INAUDIBLE]--

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.920 align:middle line:84%
why it is not minus x
modify data x over data y.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.190 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: You're
wondering about the sign.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.020 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.690 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, it is
confusing because the way that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.970 align:middle line:84%
equation is written,
it looks as if we're--

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.652 align:middle line:90%


00:00:59.652 --> 00:01:00.360 align:middle line:90%
I can't remember.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.380 align:middle line:90%
Which way is it written?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.602 align:middle line:90%
Minus, right?

00:01:03.602 --> 00:01:05.540 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, minus x.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.820 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Subtracting
the income effect,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.830 align:middle line:84%
but the graph on
the previous slide

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.290 align:middle line:84%
says we're adding
the income effect.

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.970 align:middle line:84%
If prices go down and income
effectively increases,

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.370 align:middle line:84%
then you buy more than you would
if you held income constant.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.040 align:middle line:84%
So the answer to the
puzzle is the demand

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.830 align:middle line:84%
curve figures have
reversed the dependent

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.320 align:middle line:90%
and the independent variables.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.960 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, we
usually write dy dx,

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.820 align:middle line:84%
where y is the
dependent variable,

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.180 align:middle line:84%
x is the right-hand side
independent variable,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.240 align:middle line:84%
but the demand curves actually
put price on the y-axis.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.910 align:middle line:90%


00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:01.740 align:middle line:84%
So it's the inverse slope,
if that makes sense.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.320 align:middle line:84%
So the slope dy dx, as written
in that Slutsky equation,

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.830 align:middle line:84%
is the inverse of the
slope in the diagram.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.710 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:17.020 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, don't worry.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.810 align:middle line:90%
I stumble over that myself.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.240 align:middle line:84%
I was pondering
it, and I actually

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.650 align:middle line:90%
asked Michael to look at it.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.580 align:middle line:84%
And I'd forgotten that
strange labeling that we use,

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.825 align:middle line:90%
so it is a little bit unusual.

00:02:30.825 --> 00:02:33.550 align:middle line:90%


00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.520 align:middle line:84%
Thank you for
asking the question.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.480 align:middle line:90%
I do always start the class.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.950 align:middle line:84%
So you've got us off slightly
early, but that's fine.

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.150 align:middle line:90%
Are there other questions?

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.370 align:middle line:84%
The reading list for this
lecture, it's just one starred

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.100 align:middle line:90%
reading here, Kreps chapter 7.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.640 align:middle line:84%
So again, a lot but not
all of the material today

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.910 align:middle line:84%
is in that text, and it's
starred for a reason.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.980 align:middle line:84%
I think you will
find it to be very

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.730 align:middle line:90%
helpful to read through it.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:04.230 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.970 align:middle line:90%
So that's that.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.800 align:middle line:84%
And then the study guide
on what we did last time.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.310 align:middle line:84%
OK, income and
substitution effects--

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.780 align:middle line:84%
can someone volunteer
to answer this request

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.300 align:middle line:90%
to discuss Engel's law?

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.950 align:middle line:84%
Be as clear as possible
about the data used,

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.730 align:middle line:84%
and what you would find if
you look at the data properly?

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.970 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Engel's
law is the law it

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.370 align:middle line:84%
says that the higher
proportion of your income

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.555 align:middle line:90%
is spent on food, right?

00:03:43.555 --> 00:03:48.510 align:middle line:90%


00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.220 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: The
higher is your income,

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.670 align:middle line:84%
some good expenditure
shares go up,

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.950 align:middle line:84%
and some expenditure
shares go down.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.380 align:middle line:84%
So the exact statement of it
was, I guess, in this figure

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.130 align:middle line:90%
with the data.

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.720 align:middle line:90%


00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.370 align:middle line:84%
And food is a necessity,
so the consumption actually

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:19.089 align:middle line:84%
goes down or rises less
rapidly than income does.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.790 align:middle line:90%
So thank you.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.930 align:middle line:84%
So that's where it
is in the lecture.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:32.760 align:middle line:84%
One comment I have, this is
about expenditure shares.

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:39.410 align:middle line:84%
It doesn't say the
quantity of food.

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.040 align:middle line:84%
It says 3 times the quantity
of food is going up.

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.227 align:middle line:84%
So expenditures for
food are going up.

00:04:45.227 --> 00:04:46.310 align:middle line:90%
It could be a normal good.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.380 align:middle line:84%
But it's not going up as fast
as total income is going up.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.370 align:middle line:90%


00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.870 align:middle line:84%
So last time I drew what I
called an income expansion

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.110 align:middle line:84%
path, which traces out
the locus of tangencies

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.300 align:middle line:84%
as income rises,
holding prices fixed.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:14.260 align:middle line:84%
And if they were linear,
then the expenditure shares

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.060 align:middle line:90%
are constant.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.770 align:middle line:90%
That is to say, income goes up.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.010 align:middle line:84%
The amount spent on
the first good goes--

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:23.560 align:middle line:84%
the amount spent on the
second good goes up.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.870 align:middle line:84%
Everything is rising
proportionally.

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.790 align:middle line:90%


00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.450 align:middle line:84%
In order to get the
expenditure share

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.960 align:middle line:84%
to be not rising
as fast for food,

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.840 align:middle line:84%
you have to have
those income expansion

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:46.860 align:middle line:84%
paths be somewhat curved
so that you don't get

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.068 align:middle line:90%
a proportional rise in food.

00:05:52.068 --> 00:05:53.610 align:middle line:84%
And really, answering
a question that

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:57.990 align:middle line:84%
was asked in class
last time, or at least

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.160 align:middle line:84%
what I thought about
afterwards might be helpful.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.190 align:middle line:90%
Another way to say this.

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:06.910 align:middle line:90%
We talked about Giffen goods.

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:08.730 align:middle line:84%
Oh, well, maybe
that's a question.

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.280 align:middle line:84%
So someone volunteer to tell
me, what is a Giffen good?

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:18.470 align:middle line:90%


00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:20.630 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: It's when the
price and the quantity

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.310 align:middle line:84%
demanded move in
the same direction.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.600 align:middle line:84%
So if the price of something
goes up, then you want--

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.160 align:middle line:90%
then you buy more of it.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.410 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: That's right.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.720 align:middle line:90%
OK, perfect.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:33.810 align:middle line:90%
Perfect answer.

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.350 align:middle line:84%
So the point is,
the quantity is what

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.750 align:middle line:84%
we have in mind when we
talk about Giffen goods,

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:44.150 align:middle line:84%
not price times quantity,
not expenditure shares.

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.630 align:middle line:84%
What creates a
Giffen good is a good

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.500 align:middle line:84%
which is not normal,
that is to say,

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:56.470 align:middle line:84%
where expenditures are
falling, relatively speaking,

00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:58.890 align:middle line:90%
as we increase income.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:05.440 align:middle line:84%
And the point is there's two
effects of price changes.

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.830 align:middle line:84%
Engel's law is about
income changes.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.160 align:middle line:84%
Giffen's paradox is
about a price change.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.900 align:middle line:84%
But the price
change can be broken

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.540 align:middle line:84%
into two pieces,
the substitution

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:20.470 align:middle line:84%
effect and the
consequent income effect.

00:07:20.470 --> 00:07:26.330 align:middle line:84%
And the substitution effect
does mean that as price goes up,

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:28.910 align:middle line:90%
you would demand less.

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.310 align:middle line:84%
But the income effect means
that as price goes up,

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:35.040 align:middle line:84%
you have effectively
less income.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And if it's a
necessity, then you're

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.880 align:middle line:84%
going to spend relatively
less on that good.

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So that's the-- tends to
make the quantity go down,

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.060 align:middle line:84%
so it's about income
effect dominating

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:56.740 align:middle line:84%
the price effect with
implications for quantities.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:58.340 align:middle line:90%
I hope that's helpful.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.420 align:middle line:84%
Another way to say this is when
we look at income expansion

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:04.300 align:middle line:84%
paths just changing
income, we're not

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.580 align:middle line:90%
moving the price around at all.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:11.990 align:middle line:84%
And we are assuming somehow
you can make comparisons

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:15.110 align:middle line:84%
across to different
income groups,

00:08:15.110 --> 00:08:17.370 align:middle line:84%
that they're all
facing the same prices.

00:08:17.370 --> 00:08:20.870 align:middle line:84%
It's just that some people have
more income than others, which

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:24.620 align:middle line:84%
is effectively what would
happen for a given individual

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:30.580 align:middle line:84%
if somehow a poor individual
were given more income.

00:08:30.580 --> 00:08:34.630 align:middle line:84%
But it's all about moving income
around in the cross-section

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.900 align:middle line:84%
or as if, over time
for a given individual,

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.419 align:middle line:84%
holding the prices
fixed, whereas the Giffen

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:45.250 align:middle line:84%
good has to do entirely
with just changing prices.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:48.130 align:middle line:84%
Income changes only as a
consequence of the price

00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.488 align:middle line:84%
change, and the Giffen
good is about quantity.

00:08:52.488 --> 00:08:53.530 align:middle line:90%
So I hope that's helpful.

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:56.280 align:middle line:90%


00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.720 align:middle line:84%
Can someone do
the last one here?

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.290 align:middle line:84%
Compare and contrast the
utility maximization problem

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:08.550 align:middle line:84%
with the expenditure
minimization problem.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.770 align:middle line:84%
Essentially, give a
statement of duality.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.880 align:middle line:90%
What does duality mean?

00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.110 align:middle line:90%


00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:18.840 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yep, so
the duality just

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.410 align:middle line:84%
means that these two ways of
formulating the consumer's

00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:25.440 align:middle line:84%
choice problem are, in
fact, just identical.

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.810 align:middle line:84%
Utility maximization
says given a budget,

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.760 align:middle line:84%
what's the highest
utility I can achieve?

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:35.160 align:middle line:84%
And expenditure minimization
is given a level of utility

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.990 align:middle line:84%
I want to hit, what's
the minimum budget I

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.830 align:middle line:90%
need to hit that?

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.270 align:middle line:84%
And these two will, they're
basically identical problems

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:43.660 align:middle line:90%
of each other.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:46.400 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Perfect.

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.725 align:middle line:90%
That's a perfect answer.

00:09:47.725 --> 00:09:51.250 align:middle line:90%


00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:52.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.700 align:middle line:90%
I can't add anything.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:10:00.450 align:middle line:84%
OK, so as always,
it's quite apparent

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:05.640 align:middle line:84%
these are review questions that
you should go over after class

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:07.500 align:middle line:84%
and before the next
class to make sure

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:09.270 align:middle line:84%
you're really
following the material

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:15.120 align:middle line:84%
to go with the production
lecture, lecture 4.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.620 align:middle line:84%
To get reoriented,
we have an economy,

00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:22.590 align:middle line:84%
which consists of preferences,
endowments, and technology.

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.040 align:middle line:84%
Last two lectures, we
focused on preferences.

00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:30.550 align:middle line:84%
Oh, I should have also said,
the application at the end

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:32.310 align:middle line:84%
having to do with
borrowing and lending,

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:37.890 align:middle line:84%
in addition to labeling
the goods by the date, date

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:40.950 align:middle line:84%
1 and day 2, it
was quite apparent

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.960 align:middle line:84%
that we had also actually
plotted the endowment.

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.020 align:middle line:84%
So that was a bit
different than what

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.950 align:middle line:84%
we had been doing with good
x and good y, where we just

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.550 align:middle line:90%
talked about income.

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:57.270 align:middle line:84%
So in addition to having income
i as exogenous in that diagram,

00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.880 align:middle line:84%
we had the
endowments, the amount

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.980 align:middle line:84%
of money they had in day
1, the amount of money

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.470 align:middle line:84%
they had in day 2, and
plotted the endowment

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:05.830 align:middle line:90%
point in the diagram.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:07.920 align:middle line:84%
Which is actually,
either way is fine.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.140 align:middle line:90%
But we did add more information.

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.440 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, you've seen
endowments and preferences.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.110 align:middle line:84%
Today, we're going
to do technology.

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:19.500 align:middle line:84%
In choice of
overproduction plans,

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.190 align:middle line:84%
we'll explore some
possible properties

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:28.600 align:middle line:84%
that technology sets can
have, as we did for consumer

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:30.200 align:middle line:90%
preferences, so on.

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.660 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll go
to the application,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.890 align:middle line:84%
which is going to be similar
to what we did for households.

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.000 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have firms
maximizing profits given

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.560 align:middle line:90%
a production possibility set.

00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:45.910 align:middle line:84%
And we'll take that
into an application.

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And actually, by the
end of this lecture,

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.690 align:middle line:84%
we will actually look at
our first entirely specified

00:11:52.690 --> 00:11:55.420 align:middle line:84%
economy, Robinson
Crusoe economy,

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.370 align:middle line:84%
and begin to talk about
international trade.

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So this slide is meant
to portray technology.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.160 align:middle line:84%
It's a picture I took, actually,
in Northern Thailand, where

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.750 align:middle line:90%
I was doing my field research.

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:11.350 align:middle line:84%
And if you're really
into economics,

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.460 align:middle line:84%
you'll start talking about land,
labor, and capital as inputs

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.520 align:middle line:90%
into production.

00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.970 align:middle line:90%
And here you see all three.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:21.850 align:middle line:90%
The land is kind of obvious.

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:24.220 align:middle line:90%
He's getting ready to plant.

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.740 align:middle line:84%
Labor, this guy,
who's showing off,

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.860 align:middle line:84%
by the way, because he's
not using any hands.

00:12:29.860 --> 00:12:32.650 align:middle line:84%
He's not grabbing the
handlebars on what you might

00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.080 align:middle line:90%
think is like a lawnmower.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:40.060 align:middle line:84%
And then this tiller, which
they call an iron buffalo,

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.810 align:middle line:84%
replaced the buffalo that
used to do the plowing,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.470 align:middle line:84%
and it's just this small
horsepower motor driving

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:50.440 align:middle line:90%
the treads on the wheels.

00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.810 align:middle line:90%
But anyway, that's the capital--

00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:54.790 align:middle line:90%
land, labor, and capital.

00:12:54.790 --> 00:12:58.600 align:middle line:90%
So a picture is worth 1,000.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.410 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, production,
OK-- so firms

00:13:02.410 --> 00:13:06.310 align:middle line:84%
possess production
capabilities, meaning

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.710 align:middle line:90%
some commodities are inputs.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.150 align:middle line:90%
Others are outputs.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:16.520 align:middle line:84%
And the capability is described
by a set of possible values,

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.190 align:middle line:84%
which you can
think of as vectors

00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:21.130 align:middle line:84%
with inputs and outputs,
or some people say netput.

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:25.000 align:middle line:84%
If we have the number of goods,
including inputs and outputs,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.570 align:middle line:84%
being of dimension
capital K, then a vector

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.790 align:middle line:84%
has dimension capital K, and the
set of all feasible production

00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:37.180 align:middle line:84%
vectors is called the
production possibility set.

00:13:37.180 --> 00:13:40.930 align:middle line:84%
Now, we do have a
convention, namely,

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.530 align:middle line:84%
inputs are negative, or
at least not positive,

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.860 align:middle line:84%
and outputs or positive,
or at least not negative.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:51.880 align:middle line:84%
And with a couple of exceptions,
I'm going to continue that.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:56.920 align:middle line:84%
It is easier to interpret
if we designate the inputs

00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.820 align:middle line:84%
and talk about labor
and capital and land

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:03.700 align:middle line:84%
as being positive into
a production function

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.760 align:middle line:90%
to get rice as the output.

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:09.970 align:middle line:84%
But for reasons of very
succinct accounting,

00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:13.000 align:middle line:84%
it's quite useful to have
the inputs as negative

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.270 align:middle line:90%
and the outputs as positive.

00:14:16.270 --> 00:14:21.040 align:middle line:84%
You'll see more of that powerful
notation a little bit later.

00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:27.100 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, so for example, if we
have three commodities, two

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:29.950 align:middle line:84%
of which are inputs,
say, labor and steel,

00:14:29.950 --> 00:14:32.830 align:middle line:84%
numbered 1 and 2 in the
vector, and the output

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:35.800 align:middle line:84%
being safety pins,
then, for example,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.700 align:middle line:84%
we have a netput vector of
minus 5, minus 8, and 10.

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.160 align:middle line:84%
And the inputs
are each negative,

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.940 align:middle line:84%
and the output, the steel
safety pins, is positive.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:53.800 align:middle line:90%
So not too hard.

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:58.510 align:middle line:84%
More generally, Z could be a
production possibility set.

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:01.900 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes we call
it Y. I apologize.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.830 align:middle line:90%
We used different sources here.

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:10.690 align:middle line:84%
We can write Z from 1
to K as this vector,

00:15:10.690 --> 00:15:13.800 align:middle line:84%
where, again, K is the
number of commodities.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.770 align:middle line:84%
And if we wish, we had a firm J,
we could index everything by J

00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:23.100 align:middle line:84%
and talk about the production
possibilities set of firm J

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:29.310 align:middle line:84%
and the inputs j1,
j2, through jK.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:33.810 align:middle line:84%
And then we drop the j
for most of this talk.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:37.830 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is very similar to
what we did for consumption.

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:44.010 align:middle line:84%
We had x1 through
xL, I think it was.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:51.730 align:middle line:84%
And then we put an i
for [INAUDIBLE] needed.

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.670 align:middle line:90%
So here, we're dropping the j.

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:58.410 align:middle line:84%
Here's a picture of a
production possibility set, Z,

00:15:58.410 --> 00:16:03.870 align:middle line:84%
where we have one input
only, and it's negative.

00:16:03.870 --> 00:16:07.620 align:middle line:84%
The more negative it is,
the larger the quantity

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:10.440 align:middle line:90%
being utilized is.

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, if you use more
of it, you get more output.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:20.130 align:middle line:84%
This entire speckled
region is illustrative

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:24.040 align:middle line:84%
of the entire production
possibility set.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.820 align:middle line:84%
You don't have to be
on the boundary, which

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.430 align:middle line:84%
is the maximum output you
can get for a given input

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:30.600 align:middle line:90%
in order to be in the set.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.150 align:middle line:84%
That boundary is typically
included in the set,

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:37.810 align:middle line:84%
but so are these
interior points.

00:16:37.810 --> 00:16:40.000 align:middle line:90%
So here are possible properties.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.790 align:middle line:84%
And again, just like
for the household,

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:45.990 align:middle line:84%
we didn't insist that every
class of every production

00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:middle line:84%
possibility set
contain each of these.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.660 align:middle line:84%
In fact, some of them
contradict each other,

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.230 align:middle line:90%
as you'll see in a minute.

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:55.140 align:middle line:84%
So we usually assume
it's not empty.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:58.950 align:middle line:84%
I mean, why are we writing it
down if there's nothing to do?

00:16:58.950 --> 00:17:02.430 align:middle line:84%
Closed means it
contains its boundary.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.480 align:middle line:90%
That's one way to say it.

00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.740 align:middle line:84%
Another is just that
every limit point in--

00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.380 align:middle line:84%
every sequence that
consists of points

00:17:10.380 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
in the set that converges has a
point that is also in the set.

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:17.970 align:middle line:90%
That's a technical condition.

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:23.790 align:middle line:84%
I'm sure you've noticed I'm
not overdoing the continuity

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:25.890 align:middle line:90%
part and the closure part.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:28.830 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit more
technical than we need,

00:17:28.830 --> 00:17:32.580 align:middle line:84%
and these properties
are pretty intuitive.

00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:36.720 align:middle line:84%
No free lunch means that
whenever Z is in the set

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:41.320 align:middle line:84%
and has no negative components,
you can't get any output.

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.660 align:middle line:90%
So Z is a vector.

00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:46.380 align:middle line:84%
Z can have positive and
negative components.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:51.330 align:middle line:84%
Here, writing this Z
vector being non-negative

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.940 align:middle line:84%
means that no
component in the vector

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.720 align:middle line:84%
is negative, which means
they're either 0 or positive.

00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.900 align:middle line:84%
And if they were, say, all
0, then you have no inputs,

00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.370 align:middle line:90%
and you can't get any output.

00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:04.350 align:middle line:90%
You can't get lunch out of that.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.600 align:middle line:84%
And that's the expression
"no free lunch."

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.970 align:middle line:84%
This is used by
cynical economists

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:11.910 align:middle line:84%
to mean something else, which
means if someone offered you

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
something for free, be
careful because there may be

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:17.070 align:middle line:90%
[INAUDIBLE].

00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, I won't
share that too much.

00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:24.750 align:middle line:84%
Convexity-- if you have two
elements, Z and Z prime,

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:28.860 align:middle line:84%
in the set, then the
alpha-weighted combination

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:30.430 align:middle line:90%
is also in the set.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:32.980 align:middle line:84%
We did this with
consumption sets,

00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:35.610 align:middle line:90%
so this is not surprising.

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.670 align:middle line:84%
Free disposal means
that if you have

00:18:38.670 --> 00:18:45.390 align:middle line:84%
a vector Z in the production
set and Z prime is not higher--

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.220 align:middle line:84%
say it's less than
or equal to Z--

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:50.640 align:middle line:84%
then that Z prime
is also in the set.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.200 align:middle line:90%
This is called free disposal.

00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.640 align:middle line:84%
There are two ways
to look at it.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.770 align:middle line:90%
It's kind of the same.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:58.560 align:middle line:84%
One-- suppose Z prime
had the same amount

00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.410 align:middle line:84%
of all the negative
inputs, quantities

00:19:01.410 --> 00:19:05.230 align:middle line:84%
of all the inputs, which are
negative, but at less output.

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:09.410 align:middle line:84%
So the positive components
are not greater and maybe

00:19:09.410 --> 00:19:10.860 align:middle line:90%
extremely less.

00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:13.740 align:middle line:84%
Then you're perfectly free to
throw away that extra output

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:17.760 align:middle line:84%
and maintain yourself in the
production possibilities set.

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.640 align:middle line:84%
A little less
obvious, if Z prime

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.780 align:middle line:84%
were say strictly less than Z
because the input quantities

00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.800 align:middle line:90%
are actually higher--

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:30.250 align:middle line:84%
and again, the negative
makes it look like it's less.

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:33.310 align:middle line:84%
Higher inputs means a
bigger negative number.

00:19:33.310 --> 00:19:34.860 align:middle line:90%
Then that's also in the set.

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:35.640 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.680 align:middle line:84%
Because if you've
got more inputs--

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.990 align:middle line:84%
say you're maintaining
the same output.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.210 align:middle line:84%
Well, if the inputs
were at all productive,

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:43.590 align:middle line:90%
you would have had more output.

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.160 align:middle line:90%
But you throw away that output.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:47.640 align:middle line:90%
That's the free disposal again.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.160 align:middle line:84%
And then, finally, you
can always shut down.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
Most, I think, production
functions, production sets have

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.890 align:middle line:84%
that property,
that 0 is feasible,

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:59.880 align:middle line:84%
which is a bit different
from saying it's empty.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:02.250 align:middle line:84%
It means 0 is in there, but
other things are usually

00:20:02.250 --> 00:20:04.360 align:middle line:90%
typically also in there.

00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:09.750 align:middle line:84%
So three other properties--
decreasing returns to scale.

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:middle line:90%
And I'll show you some pictures.

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.120 align:middle line:84%
If Z is in there and
alpha is less than 1,

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.170 align:middle line:84%
then alpha times Z
is also in there.

00:20:17.170 --> 00:20:19.680 align:middle line:84%
So decreasing returns
actually means

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:24.360 align:middle line:84%
you can scale back something
in the production function,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.690 align:middle line:90%
like US Steel blast furnaces.

00:20:27.690 --> 00:20:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And somehow they can pare that
down and make a smaller one.

00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:35.580 align:middle line:84%
So it may not be true, but
that's what the property is.

00:20:35.580 --> 00:20:37.440 align:middle line:84%
Constant returns
means that you can

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.220 align:middle line:84%
scale up or down
willy-nilly and still

00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:45.390 align:middle line:84%
have the vector alpha Z in
the production set when Z is.

00:20:45.390 --> 00:20:48.520 align:middle line:84%
And increasing returns
goes the other way.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:51.990 align:middle line:84%
If you have Z in the set
and alpha is greater than 1,

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:55.270 align:middle line:84%
then alpha times Z is also
in the production set,

00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.720 align:middle line:84%
which means, in this
case, to continue

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.820 align:middle line:90%
the example of US Steel.

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:02.250 align:middle line:84%
If you still has one
big blast furnace,

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.580 align:middle line:84%
they can just as easily
have two or three.

00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:06.960 align:middle line:90%
They can run them.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.760 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let me draw
you some pictures.

00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.550 align:middle line:84%
This is decreasing
returns, which intuitively

00:21:14.550 --> 00:21:20.010 align:middle line:84%
comes from the
curvature declining

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:24.990 align:middle line:84%
of the boundary of the
production possibility set.

00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:28.320 align:middle line:84%
The property says if
you're given Y in the set

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.760 align:middle line:84%
and it's not 0, then
alpha between 0 and 1

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:38.050 align:middle line:84%
times Y is also in the set,
which these things are.

00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:40.930 align:middle line:84%
This is increasing
returns, which is,

00:21:40.930 --> 00:21:44.680 align:middle line:84%
whoa, getting
steeper and steeper,

00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.210 align:middle line:84%
and then there's [INAUDIBLE],,
but it's instructive.

00:21:48.210 --> 00:21:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
same alpha Y, yes.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:54.090 align:middle line:84%
But the property of
increasing returns

00:21:54.090 --> 00:22:01.230 align:middle line:84%
says if you have Y, say, here
and alpha is greater than 1,

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.940 align:middle line:90%
then alpha lies in the set.

00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.310 align:middle line:90%
So, actually, the error--

00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:06.810 align:middle line:90%
we'll fix this, I guess--

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.950 align:middle line:84%
is that the alpha Y should
have been depicted out here

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.090 align:middle line:90%
in the production set.

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:16.840 align:middle line:84%
All this area is in
the production set.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:21.430 align:middle line:84%
And then constant returns is
neither of those extremes.

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:23.840 align:middle line:90%
It's just a linear boundary.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.900 align:middle line:84%
And it says if you pick
anything in the set,

00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:31.330 align:middle line:84%
say, here, and then draw
a line, a ray, from the 0

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.450 align:middle line:84%
through that picked
point, everything

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:39.190 align:middle line:84%
on that ray towards 0 or out
to infinity is also in the set.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And I guess we should have
put alpha down here instead

00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:44.110 align:middle line:84%
of lambda, but it's
kind of obvious.

00:22:44.110 --> 00:22:46.420 align:middle line:84%
So constant returns
to scale is going

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:51.160 align:middle line:84%
to have some strong properties,
which we'll come to.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.240 align:middle line:84%
One word about aggregating
up production sets--

00:22:56.240 --> 00:23:00.820 align:middle line:84%
so this is one of the
exceptions, where what--

00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.110 align:middle line:84%
well, this is the
classic picture.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:05.360 align:middle line:90%
Inputs on the x-axis.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.865 align:middle line:90%
Output on the y-axis.

00:23:06.865 --> 00:23:08.240 align:middle line:84%
This would be the
production set.

00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:10.460 align:middle line:84%
Here's a point on
the boundary of one

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.460 align:middle line:84%
firm's, labeled
number 1 firm here.

00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.050 align:middle line:84%
Also, the exception is we're
labeling firms 1 and 2.

00:23:18.050 --> 00:23:21.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the production
set of another one

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.090 align:middle line:84%
that actually uses as an input
the output that this produces.

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.890 align:middle line:84%
And I'll come back
to that later.

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:33.230 align:middle line:84%
In this case, the inputs
and outputs are reversed.

00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:36.740 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we have
an endowment point.

00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.690 align:middle line:84%
So we wanted to add
all these things up

00:23:38.690 --> 00:23:42.140 align:middle line:84%
and get the aggregate
set of possibilities.

00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.970 align:middle line:84%
You got to do a lot
of vector algebra.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:47.750 align:middle line:84%
But essentially, what's
going on here is start at 0.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.860 align:middle line:90%
That's feasible.

00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.480 align:middle line:90%
It uses less than endowment.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:51.800 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:56.690 align:middle line:84%
Then find y1 on the first
production set-- y1.

00:23:56.690 --> 00:23:59.060 align:middle line:90%
Then add that endowment back in.

00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:84%
Notice this, the
parallel line shift.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:06.290 align:middle line:84%
And then, so far, we've
been keeping y2 at 0,

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:10.250 align:middle line:84%
but let's move y2 to something
non-trivial production.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.230 align:middle line:84%
That movement here is the
same as this movement here.

00:24:13.230 --> 00:24:18.410 align:middle line:84%
So at this point, which is,
of course, the sum of y1, y2,

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:22.370 align:middle line:84%
and z1, is feasible
because it comes

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:25.020 align:middle line:90%
from these three possibilities.

00:24:25.020 --> 00:24:29.720 align:middle line:84%
So this larger area out here
is the aggregated or aggregate

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.190 align:middle line:90%
production set.

00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:33.750 align:middle line:84%
Now let's talk about
the firm's problem.

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:36.170 align:middle line:84%
So we're already getting
into an application now.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:40.580 align:middle line:84%
There are these prices, p,
which the firm takes as given,

00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.230 align:middle line:84%
just like the household
took prices as given.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:48.440 align:middle line:84%
And the firm wants to come up
with a plan, input-output plan,

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.790 align:middle line:90%
to maximize its profit.

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:56.090 align:middle line:84%
So this capital pi here is just
a statement of prices time pk

00:24:56.090 --> 00:25:00.170 align:middle line:84%
times zk, summing
up over all the k's.

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:03.530 align:middle line:84%
And here, again, it looks
like everything's positive.

00:25:03.530 --> 00:25:04.610 align:middle line:90%
What a wonderful world.

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:08.720 align:middle line:84%
But some of these z's are
required to be negative.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.960 align:middle line:84%
And hence, [INAUDIBLE]
times a negative object.

00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.712 align:middle line:84%
So there's expenses in
here and revenues in here.

00:25:16.712 --> 00:25:18.920 align:middle line:84%
And then when we talk about
the firm's problem, which

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:23.900 align:middle line:84%
is FP, for Firm's Problem,
is to maximize the profits

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:27.410 align:middle line:84%
by choosing feasible points
vectors in the production

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:29.210 align:middle line:90%
possibilities set.

00:25:29.210 --> 00:25:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So this very cryptic abbreviated
notation, max p of z,

00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:37.820 align:middle line:90%
[? proves ?] z and z.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:39.660 align:middle line:90%
And here's our picture.

00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:43.070 align:middle line:84%
So inputs, which are
negative in sign,

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:45.140 align:middle line:90%
outputs, which are positive.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.860 align:middle line:84%
These guys here, these
linear hyperplanes,

00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.740 align:middle line:84%
represent possible
profit levels.

00:25:51.740 --> 00:25:54.350 align:middle line:90%
Call them isoprofit lines.

00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:56.150 align:middle line:84%
When we introduced
indifference curves,

00:25:56.150 --> 00:25:59.810 align:middle line:84%
I said it might be better to
call them isoutility lines,

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:02.750 align:middle line:84%
and I was anticipating
this slide

00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:04.370 align:middle line:90%
and another one that's coming.

00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:09.440 align:middle line:84%
So an isoprofit line means
as you, say, use more inputs

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.670 align:middle line:84%
but get more output, you have
expenses balancing revenues,

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:15.450 align:middle line:90%
and you stay on this line.

00:26:15.450 --> 00:26:21.380 align:middle line:84%
If you go put in lower inputs,
so for the same prices,

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:23.840 align:middle line:90%
you would have higher profits.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:28.400 align:middle line:84%
The slope of any
isoprofit line is just

00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.250 align:middle line:84%
price of output divided
by the price of input,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.320 align:middle line:90%
like p2 over p1.

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:35.990 align:middle line:84%
And of course, we're
depicting this tangency

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:37.760 align:middle line:90%
as the maximum profit line.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:40.400 align:middle line:84%
You could be in the
interior, but then you

00:26:40.400 --> 00:26:42.560 align:middle line:90%
would not be maximizing.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:51.380 align:middle line:84%
So let's call little pi of p
to be the maximized profit, not

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:55.100 align:middle line:84%
just any old profit, which
was capital pi a minute ago.

00:26:55.100 --> 00:27:00.260 align:middle line:84%
This is the best choice
of production vector

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.690 align:middle line:84%
z in the production
set, given price

00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:05.450 align:middle line:90%
is p. p is a parameter here.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:07.970 align:middle line:84%
This is, quote,
partial equilibrium, so

00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:11.330 align:middle line:90%
we index the solution by p.

00:27:11.330 --> 00:27:14.360 align:middle line:84%
Of course, we'll do
experiments where we vary p.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:15.980 align:middle line:90%
There are some profits--

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:19.530 align:middle line:84%
properties of the
profit function,

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:23.340 align:middle line:84%
namely, this profit
function pi is

00:27:23.340 --> 00:27:28.290 align:middle line:84%
homogeneous of degree 1
in the price vector p.

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:32.610 align:middle line:84%
Homogeneous of degree 1 means
that if you scale prices

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:36.090 align:middle line:84%
up by some proportion,
like doubling them,

00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:40.680 align:middle line:84%
then maximized profit
should also double.

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.280 align:middle line:84%
The reason that should
be obvious, at least when

00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:47.280 align:middle line:84%
you think about it, if
we're doubling prices,

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.920 align:middle line:90%
we're not changing the slope.

00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.630 align:middle line:84%
So we're not changing
the maximizing choice.

00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:57.320 align:middle line:84%
But we have changed the
levels of the prices,

00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:01.130 align:middle line:84%
and the levels means even
though the z's aren't moving,

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:02.150 align:middle line:90%
the prices are moving.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:04.340 align:middle line:84%
If prices have
doubled, then it must

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:10.760 align:middle line:84%
be that profits have doubled
and constant returns to scale.

00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.040 align:middle line:84%
Homogeneous to
degree one, sorry--

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.170 align:middle line:90%
homogeneous to degree 1.

00:28:15.170 --> 00:28:19.160 align:middle line:90%
Profit function is continuous.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.940 align:middle line:84%
It's actually true much more
generally than you might think,

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:27.790 align:middle line:84%
but I'm not into emphasizing
continuity too much these days.

00:28:27.790 --> 00:28:29.690 align:middle line:90%
Profit function is convex.

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.390 align:middle line:90%
That's an np.

00:28:31.390 --> 00:28:33.140 align:middle line:84%
So that's an
interesting property.

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:34.990 align:middle line:90%
So let's look at that one.

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:38.740 align:middle line:90%
The profit function is convex.

00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.530 align:middle line:90%
OK, what do we want to show?

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.030 align:middle line:90%
If we have two p's--

00:28:43.030 --> 00:28:50.790 align:middle line:84%
two prices p and [INAUDIBLE]
the associated profits, pi of p

00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:54.240 align:middle line:84%
and pi of p prime, then we
take the linear combination

00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.410 align:middle line:84%
of the prices, say, p double
prime, this alpha weighted sum,

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:02.628 align:middle line:84%
the associated profits
should be not greater

00:29:02.628 --> 00:29:04.170 align:middle line:84%
than the weighted
sum of the profits.

00:29:04.170 --> 00:29:05.790 align:middle line:90%
So I said that in words.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.430 align:middle line:84%
It's probably just a whole lot
easier to do the mechanics.

00:29:08.430 --> 00:29:11.430 align:middle line:84%
So we start with two
prices, p and p prime.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:12.960 align:middle line:90%
We pick an alpha.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.650 align:middle line:84%
We consider p double prime
to be the alpha-weighted sum.

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:23.760 align:middle line:84%
We let z be the solution to
the firm's profit maximization

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:27.070 align:middle line:90%
problem at p double prime.

00:29:27.070 --> 00:29:31.500 align:middle line:84%
So in other words, that
special maximized profit pi

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.170 align:middle line:84%
of p double prime is just
p double prime times z

00:29:34.170 --> 00:29:36.310 align:middle line:90%
because z is the solution.

00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:39.240 align:middle line:90%
Now, z, therefore, was feasible.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.940 align:middle line:84%
It was in the production
possibility set.

00:29:41.940 --> 00:29:44.250 align:middle line:84%
So even though we
changed the prices,

00:29:44.250 --> 00:29:49.260 align:middle line:84%
that z remains feasible,
which means whatever solves

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:52.980 align:middle line:84%
the problem at p, it cannot
deliver a lower number than

00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:56.520 align:middle line:84%
this and may deliver
a higher one.

00:29:56.520 --> 00:29:58.950 align:middle line:84%
The profit-maximizing
solution at p

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:03.150 align:middle line:84%
might involve a different
z different from z.

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:06.270 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, the
profit-maximizing solution

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:10.680 align:middle line:84%
at p prime can only be
not lower and maybe higher

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.370 align:middle line:84%
than p prime
evaluated at this z.

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:17.020 align:middle line:90%
OK, so now we do the math.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:20.110 align:middle line:84%
We want to show that
pi at p double prime,

00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:23.880 align:middle line:84%
which is, by definition,
p double prime at z.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.050 align:middle line:90%
Remember the starting point.

00:30:25.050 --> 00:30:26.520 align:middle line:84%
We're starting at
p double prime,

00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.510 align:middle line:84%
and we're told that
z is the solution.

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:31.840 align:middle line:90%
So this is p double prime z.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.720 align:middle line:84%
But p double prime
written out is just alpha

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.820 align:middle line:90%
p, 1 minus alpha p prime--

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:39.580 align:middle line:84%
that was the
definition-- times z.

00:30:39.580 --> 00:30:43.610 align:middle line:84%
And now we invoke each of these
two weak inequalities and say,

00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:50.320 align:middle line:84%
well, alpha p times z is
alpha pz less than pi of p.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.780 align:middle line:84%
So the inequality is
less than or equal to,

00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:55.900 align:middle line:84%
and we get the same
thing for p prime.

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:59.800 align:middle line:84%
Sorry, I think the ratio of my
words to what's on the slide--

00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:01.360 align:middle line:84%
I must have talked
for three minutes.

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.150 align:middle line:84%
But there's only four
lines here, so I apologize.

00:31:06.150 --> 00:31:11.415 align:middle line:84%
Alpha function is convex, maybe
weakly, but it's not concave,

00:31:11.415 --> 00:31:13.650 align:middle line:90%
or not strictly concave.

00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:17.020 align:middle line:84%
It may be convex
or strictly convex.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.800 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we'll come back
to that momentarily.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.140 align:middle line:84%
Homogeneity-- two
more properties,

00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:24.590 align:middle line:90%
and back to convexity.

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:27.940 align:middle line:84%
So if f is a real
valued function,

00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:31.330 align:middle line:84%
mapping rn into r
and k is an integer,

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.390 align:middle line:84%
we say f is
homogeneous of degree k

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.900 align:middle line:84%
if whenever you scale the
arguments of the function up

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:38.590 align:middle line:90%
by--

00:31:38.590 --> 00:31:42.670 align:middle line:84%
the arguments of the function
v by alpha, the value

00:31:42.670 --> 00:31:44.680 align:middle line:90%
in the domain goes up by--

00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:47.800 align:middle line:84%
in the range goes up by
alpha to the power k.

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:54.490 align:middle line:84%
So homogeneous of degree 0
would mean nothing changes.

00:31:54.490 --> 00:31:57.310 align:middle line:84%
Homogeneous of
degree 1 we just did

00:31:57.310 --> 00:32:00.640 align:middle line:84%
for profits, where
k is equal to 1,

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:03.295 align:middle line:84%
and this is the most
general concept.

00:32:03.295 --> 00:32:06.200 align:middle line:90%


00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:09.950 align:middle line:84%
Another property of
the profit function--

00:32:09.950 --> 00:32:13.280 align:middle line:84%
it's continuously
differentiable.

00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:15.590 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to show
you an expression

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.180 align:middle line:90%
with the derivatives.

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:22.370 align:middle line:84%
If you take that function, which
has as a parameter the price

00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:27.200 align:middle line:84%
vector p, and differentiate the
maximized profit with respect

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:33.410 align:middle line:84%
to, say, the k-th item, pk,
holding all the prices--

00:32:33.410 --> 00:32:39.110 align:middle line:84%
doing it locally around the
maximizing value p star,

00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.420 align:middle line:90%
then the solution is the input.

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.970 align:middle line:90%
You get the input back.

00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:49.570 align:middle line:84%
Derivative with respect to
pk, you get the input zk.

00:32:49.570 --> 00:32:52.690 align:middle line:84%
A quick, maybe
misleading, intuition

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:56.620 align:middle line:84%
for that is you
write down profits--

00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:00.490 align:middle line:84%
p1, z1, p2, z2, et
cetera, et cetera.

00:33:00.490 --> 00:33:03.730 align:middle line:84%
Take a derivative at
the maximizing solution

00:33:03.730 --> 00:33:07.090 align:middle line:84%
The derivative is
with respective pk.

00:33:07.090 --> 00:33:08.810 align:middle line:90%
Where does that show up?

00:33:08.810 --> 00:33:12.310 align:middle line:84%
It shows up in the pk,
zk term, so it seems

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:15.140 align:middle line:90%
like this ought to be true.

00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:19.230 align:middle line:84%
Actually, what it's
using is the convexity.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:22.310 align:middle line:84%
So this thing is called
Hotelling's lemma.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:25.910 align:middle line:84%
Here is the actual
profit function, but now

00:33:25.910 --> 00:33:27.740 align:middle line:90%
with all the prices.

00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:31.640 align:middle line:84%
It's actually got a star on
everything but the k-th price

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.440 align:middle line:90%
here, no star.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:37.580 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
evaluate profit at star k.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.910 align:middle line:84%
So we're right here on
this profit function.

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:44.900 align:middle line:84%
This would be the maximized
profit in general,

00:33:44.900 --> 00:33:47.900 align:middle line:84%
and also the maximized
profit in particular

00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.890 align:middle line:84%
when the price of the k-th
input or output is pk.

00:33:51.890 --> 00:33:53.660 align:middle line:90%
What is this n?

00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.520 align:middle line:90%
And this is like a tangency?

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:56.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a straight line.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.670 align:middle line:90%
And what is this straight line?

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:02.600 align:middle line:84%
That's just what I
was saying in words.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:06.350 align:middle line:84%
That's just the evaluation
of inputs and outputs

00:34:06.350 --> 00:34:09.820 align:middle line:84%
at this price vector star,
and it starred everywhere.

00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.560 align:middle line:84%
OK, so pk doesn't
have a star here.

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.480 align:middle line:84%
But because we're plotting
everything is a function of pq,

00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:20.929 align:middle line:84%
but there is a particular
pk, namely pk star,

00:34:20.929 --> 00:34:23.659 align:middle line:84%
where we can evaluate
that linear function.

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:25.670 align:middle line:84%
Now, the point of
the tangency is

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:29.100 align:middle line:84%
that the curved function,
the profit margin,

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.280 align:middle line:84%
and this linear function
have the same slope.

00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:35.330 align:middle line:84%
So if we want to know how the
profit function is changing

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:39.679 align:middle line:84%
as we change pk locally,
we can just as easily

00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:42.230 align:middle line:84%
show how this straight
line is changing

00:34:42.230 --> 00:34:46.340 align:middle line:84%
as we change pk locally because
they have the same slope.

00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:50.870 align:middle line:84%
And how is the linear function
changing as we change pk?

00:34:50.870 --> 00:34:52.580 align:middle line:84%
Well, it's just
changing linearly.

00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:55.190 align:middle line:84%
So that's the
derivative, namely zk.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.900 align:middle line:90%
So that's the proof of this.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:00.500 align:middle line:84%
So we did actually use the
convexity of the profit

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:03.475 align:middle line:84%
function, and the picture
is strict convexity.

00:35:03.475 --> 00:35:04.850 align:middle line:84%
It actually works
more generally,

00:35:04.850 --> 00:35:08.710 align:middle line:84%
but it would be a pretty
hard picture to interpret.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:12.050 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is also illustrative
of something else called

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:16.190 align:middle line:84%
the envelope theorem, and I'll
just show you the definition.

00:35:16.190 --> 00:35:18.890 align:middle line:84%
Oh, and remember
the strategy here.

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:23.440 align:middle line:84%
Tools-- so every so often,
we bump into a concept

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:24.790 align:middle line:90%
that generalizes.

00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:30.100 align:middle line:84%
In this case, we just went
over some example of something

00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:31.300 align:middle line:90%
called the envelope theorem.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:34.540 align:middle line:84%
So let me give you a statement
of the general theorem.

00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.180 align:middle line:84%
If fact, [INAUDIBLE]
[? set ?] and let

00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:41.000 align:middle line:84%
t be some parameter
of the problem.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.390 align:middle line:84%
We have a function
f mapping elements

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:45.880 align:middle line:84%
in the choice set
in that parameter

00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:52.250 align:middle line:84%
into some real valued objective
function, namely like this.

00:35:52.250 --> 00:35:55.270 align:middle line:84%
So put max here if
you're more comfortable.

00:35:55.270 --> 00:35:58.030 align:middle line:84%
So f is the thing
we want to max.

00:35:58.030 --> 00:36:01.230 align:middle line:84%
We want to max it
by choice of x.

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:04.830 align:middle line:84%
But we have a parameter
in the problem called t,

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:10.170 align:middle line:84%
so we denote the solution,
the maximized value of f, at t

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:13.470 align:middle line:84%
to be V of t, the
value function at t.

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:15.330 align:middle line:90%
And what is X star?

00:36:15.330 --> 00:36:18.870 align:middle line:84%
X star is just the set
of all maximizers X.

00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:20.830 align:middle line:90%
It could be unique.

00:36:20.830 --> 00:36:22.410 align:middle line:90%
There could be many.

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:25.020 align:middle line:84%
But each one of them,
if there are many,

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.380 align:middle line:84%
has to have the
property that evaluating

00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:33.210 align:middle line:84%
the function f at that
maximizer x gives you V back.

00:36:33.210 --> 00:36:36.510 align:middle line:84%
And again, everything
is indexed by t.

00:36:36.510 --> 00:36:40.410 align:middle line:84%
Now for the big E. If you took
the derivative of the value

00:36:40.410 --> 00:36:44.940 align:middle line:84%
function with respect to t,
even though t is a parameter,

00:36:44.940 --> 00:36:50.100 align:middle line:84%
it will be the derivative
of the underlying

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.530 align:middle line:84%
function you're
trying to maximize

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:56.370 align:middle line:90%
at the optimized solution.

00:36:56.370 --> 00:37:02.070 align:middle line:84%
That is for an x in the
set of maximizers at t.

00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:07.080 align:middle line:84%
So one thing to say this is
an example of that, right?

00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:12.100 align:middle line:84%
We wanted the profit
function, which

00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.430 align:middle line:84%
is parameterized
by not t, but p,

00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:18.910 align:middle line:84%
and we wanted to know how it
would behave at the optimum

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:22.780 align:middle line:84%
if we were to slightly
change the parameter p.

00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.380 align:middle line:84%
And we just took the derivative
of the objective function

00:37:26.380 --> 00:37:30.010 align:middle line:84%
at the optimizing
solution, which

00:37:30.010 --> 00:37:35.320 align:middle line:84%
here is what this line is
at, the optimizing solution.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:38.740 align:middle line:90%
And the derivative was just z.

00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:40.960 align:middle line:84%
Well, at the risk of
confusing the issue,

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.170 align:middle line:84%
there was this chat
going on about lambda

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:47.770 align:middle line:84%
as the margin utility of income
in the consumers problem.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.830 align:middle line:84%
And, again, income was a
parameter of the problem.

00:37:51.830 --> 00:37:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And nevertheless, we wanted to
know how utility would change--

00:37:55.810 --> 00:37:58.870 align:middle line:90%
in this case, utility f--

00:37:58.870 --> 00:38:04.060 align:middle line:84%
how utility would change as we
change that parameter income i.

00:38:04.060 --> 00:38:07.840 align:middle line:84%
And the answer from the
envelope theorem is it

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:12.250 align:middle line:84%
is the derivative of a
maximized objective function--

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:15.100 align:middle line:84%
that is to say, of utility
substituting in the budget

00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:16.330 align:middle line:90%
constraint--

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:18.520 align:middle line:90%
at parameter i.

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:20.680 align:middle line:84%
So that's consistent
with this language

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.900 align:middle line:84%
of the marginal
utility of income.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.690 align:middle line:84%
In the chat, there
is a great discussion

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:30.760 align:middle line:84%
about that Lagrangian, which
is so powerful it's mysterious,

00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:35.230 align:middle line:84%
because the Lagrangian has
those Lagrange multipliers types

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:38.800 align:middle line:84%
constraints, not just
the objective function.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.550 align:middle line:84%
So the chat was, it's not really
marginal utility because it's

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:43.510 align:middle line:90%
a Lagrangian.

00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:46.850 align:middle line:84%
It didn't just write down
the utility term, et cetera,

00:38:46.850 --> 00:38:47.350 align:middle line:90%
et cetera.

00:38:47.350 --> 00:38:49.960 align:middle line:90%
But you can see how it--

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.320 align:middle line:84%
hopefully get a little more
intuition about that problem

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:56.020 align:middle line:90%
from the envelope theorem.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:39:00.950 align:middle line:84%
OK, so, as I said before, in
many applications that we're

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:03.800 align:middle line:84%
clear about what's an
input and what's an output,

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:06.710 align:middle line:84%
we could have, for
example, n possible inputs

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:09.800 align:middle line:84%
and m possible
outputs, and then we'd

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:14.300 align:middle line:84%
be writing these vectors
as negatives for the n

00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:18.590 align:middle line:84%
inputs and positive [INAUDIBLE]
m outputs [INAUDIBLE]

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.290 align:middle line:84%
some degrees of freedom,
depending on the production

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:21.870 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:23.720 align:middle line:90%
The other things being 0.

00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.810 align:middle line:84%
There are things other firms
can do this firm cannot.

00:39:26.810 --> 00:39:29.870 align:middle line:90%
So we could maximize if--

00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:30.960 align:middle line:90%
even easier.

00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:36.740 align:middle line:84%
There's a single output and
capital N possible inputs.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:41.380 align:middle line:84%
We can talk about a
production function.

00:39:41.380 --> 00:39:46.450 align:middle line:84%
Rice is a function of labor,
holding capital and land fixed,

00:39:46.450 --> 00:39:48.260 align:middle line:90%
for example.

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.920 align:middle line:84%
Or we could have
multiple vectors x--

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.390 align:middle line:90%
land, labor, and capital.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:57.530 align:middle line:84%
And we write down this output
function, this production

00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:59.530 align:middle line:90%
function.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:05.380 align:middle line:84%
We will have prices of the
output p, say, taken as given.

00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.573 align:middle line:84%
We'll have the prices
of the N inputs, W1

00:40:09.573 --> 00:40:11.610 align:middle line:90%
through wn taken as given.

00:40:11.610 --> 00:40:13.790 align:middle line:84%
And we can write down
the profit maximization

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:17.060 align:middle line:84%
problem, now with a bit
more intuitive signs.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:21.530 align:middle line:84%
It's revenue, price times
output, minus the cost

00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:26.585 align:middle line:84%
of the inputs that were used to
create that output at the price

00:40:26.585 --> 00:40:27.740 align:middle line:90%
is wn.

00:40:27.740 --> 00:40:32.060 align:middle line:84%
If f is differentiable, then
we can look for the first order

00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:32.710 align:middle line:90%
conditions.

00:40:32.710 --> 00:40:35.120 align:middle line:90%
That derivative's equal to 0.

00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Say, in particular with
respect to the nth input,

00:40:38.990 --> 00:40:44.810 align:middle line:84%
we'll get p times the derivative
of [? f of ?] xn over here,

00:40:44.810 --> 00:40:47.580 align:middle line:90%
and we'll get wn here.

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:49.030 align:middle line:90%
That's just expression.

00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:51.990 align:middle line:84%
So the shorthand
way to say this is

00:40:51.990 --> 00:40:56.800 align:middle line:84%
the value of the marginal
product or the marginal revenue

00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.670 align:middle line:90%
product is equal to the price.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:03.670 align:middle line:90%
That's economist speak.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:05.800 align:middle line:84%
If you think about what
would happen when this is,

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:11.410 align:middle line:84%
say, greater than the right-hand
side, that means one more

00:41:11.410 --> 00:41:14.890 align:middle line:90%
unit of input costs you wn.

00:41:14.890 --> 00:41:18.730 align:middle line:84%
But that input applied to
the production function

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:23.020 align:middle line:84%
gives you a marginal output,
and that marginal output

00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:27.730 align:middle line:84%
evaluated at the price gives
you the marginal revenue.

00:41:27.730 --> 00:41:29.830 align:middle line:84%
So if the left-hand
side is greater

00:41:29.830 --> 00:41:31.300 align:middle line:84%
than the right-hand
side, you can't

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.140 align:middle line:84%
be done because you get more
out of increasing your costs.

00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:38.650 align:middle line:84%
You more balance your costs
by increasing your revenue.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:42.190 align:middle line:84%
And likewise, when the
inequality goes the other way,

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:46.600 align:middle line:84%
you've gone too far and used
up too much of the inputs.

00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.830 align:middle line:84%
So this is a very
intuitive expression.

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:53.700 align:middle line:84%
So now let's talk about
cost minimization.

00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.030 align:middle line:84%
Instead of solving
the global problem

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.900 align:middle line:84%
and finding the
maximizing profit,

00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.180 align:middle line:84%
maximizing inputs
and outputs, we're

00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.190 align:middle line:84%
going to break the
problem into pieces

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:09.315 align:middle line:84%
and take the output
y as a given,

00:42:09.315 --> 00:42:11.280 align:middle line:90%
like something exogenous.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.280 align:middle line:90%
Got to do it.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.780 align:middle line:90%
Got to achieve it.

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:18.120 align:middle line:84%
But let's achieve it in
the cost minimizing way.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.580 align:middle line:84%
So here's a statement
of the problem.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:28.600 align:middle line:84%
If this V of y is the input set
that delivers y as the output,

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.050 align:middle line:84%
taking y as given, we can
choose any input vector, as long

00:42:32.050 --> 00:42:34.570 align:middle line:90%
as it gives us the output of y.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:38.200 align:middle line:84%
So let's minimize the
cost, the dot product w

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:42.940 align:middle line:84%
times x, which is the cost
for achieving that output y.

00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:47.960 align:middle line:84%
And let's call that
the cost function.

00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:52.810 align:middle line:84%
It's the cost of producing y
in the least possible cost way,

00:42:52.810 --> 00:42:56.890 align:middle line:90%
given input, price, vector w.

00:42:56.890 --> 00:42:59.110 align:middle line:84%
The price of output
doesn't matter here

00:42:59.110 --> 00:43:01.750 align:middle line:90%
because that's a given anyway.

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:03.820 align:middle line:84%
That is to say, price
is not only given.

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:05.020 align:middle line:90%
Output is given.

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.450 align:middle line:84%
So revenue is not
in question here.

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:11.690 align:middle line:84%
It's just the cost of financing
it through the inputs.

00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:15.940 align:middle line:84%
So we'll call the solution
conditional factor demands.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.850 align:middle line:84%
And in principle,
they're a function

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:25.000 align:middle line:90%
of these parameters W and y.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.830 align:middle line:90%
So let me draw you a picture.

00:43:26.830 --> 00:43:30.220 align:middle line:84%
In this case, there's going
to be an output level.

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:32.920 align:middle line:84%
That's to think of
it as a single good.

00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:35.020 align:middle line:90%
q is the level.

00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.700 align:middle line:90%
And we're going to plot--

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.310 align:middle line:84%
and there's two
inputs, x1 and x2.

00:43:39.310 --> 00:43:44.140 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to plot here the
set of all inputs that give you

00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.910 align:middle line:90%
the same output.

00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:47.260 align:middle line:90%
That's that curve.

00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.990 align:middle line:84%
Since the quantity is
the same, namely q,

00:43:49.990 --> 00:43:51.490 align:middle line:90%
we've got a name for this guy.

00:43:51.490 --> 00:43:56.230 align:middle line:84%
It's isoquant, which is
the final instance of iso

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:57.250 align:middle line:90%
this and that.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:04.270 align:middle line:84%
So isoquant for same quantity
as we move along this isoquant.

00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:06.700 align:middle line:84%
And what are these
straight lines?

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.850 align:middle line:84%
Our expenditure curves--
they're down here.

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:13.330 align:middle line:84%
w times w1 x1 plus
w2 x2 equals c,

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:15.730 align:middle line:90%
where c is some level of cost.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.210 align:middle line:84%
The higher ones are
associated with higher costs.

00:44:19.210 --> 00:44:23.500 align:middle line:84%
To minimize [INAUDIBLE]
one, move towards 0.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.740 align:middle line:90%
So the solution is here.

00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:29.710 align:middle line:84%
It's the minimized
cost that allows

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.780 align:middle line:90%
you to be on the isoquant.

00:44:31.780 --> 00:44:35.650 align:middle line:84%
In fact, the way it's drawn, and
the other point on the isoquant

00:44:35.650 --> 00:44:38.770 align:middle line:84%
would give strictly
higher costs.

00:44:38.770 --> 00:44:40.860 align:middle line:90%
You with me?

00:44:40.860 --> 00:44:45.240 align:middle line:84%
So you can also
characterize this tangency.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:50.610 align:middle line:84%
The slope of this cost
line is w1 over w2.

00:44:50.610 --> 00:44:55.020 align:middle line:84%
The slope of the isoquant
is like a marginal rate

00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:58.980 align:middle line:84%
of substitution, except we call
it the marginal rate of product

00:44:58.980 --> 00:44:59.970 align:middle line:90%
transformation.

00:44:59.970 --> 00:45:05.010 align:middle line:84%
It's the rate at which you
can give up the use of input 2

00:45:05.010 --> 00:45:10.210 align:middle line:84%
and use input 1 in such a way as
to maintain quantity constant.

00:45:10.210 --> 00:45:13.950 align:middle line:84%
So this is very similar
to the indifference curve

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:16.200 align:middle line:90%
that we had in consumer theory.

00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:19.530 align:middle line:84%
And this characterization
of the tangency

00:45:19.530 --> 00:45:24.270 align:middle line:84%
is similar in terms of the
ratios of the two tangent lines

00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:26.200 align:middle line:90%
being the same.

00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:28.860 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So the thing that's
getting toggled in this case

00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.637 align:middle line:90%
is the budget line, right?

00:45:32.637 --> 00:45:34.970 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: The thing
that we're trying to minimize

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:35.640 align:middle line:90%
is cost.

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.510 align:middle line:84%
So this, instead of
being a budget line,

00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:40.425 align:middle line:90%
it's an isocost line.

00:45:40.425 --> 00:45:41.300 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:44.690 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, and
we're trying to move this way

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:48.770 align:middle line:90%
to make it as low as possible.

00:45:48.770 --> 00:45:50.510 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, so that's
another difference.

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:55.308 align:middle line:84%
When we did utility
max, we had a budget,

00:45:55.308 --> 00:45:56.600 align:middle line:90%
and we were trying to maximize.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:00.650 align:middle line:84%
Although, we did in
the duality lecture

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.440 align:middle line:84%
talk about minimizing
the cost of achieving

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:06.960 align:middle line:84%
a certain level of utility,
and this is very close to that.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So here, we're
minimizing the cost

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:11.270 align:middle line:84%
of achieving this
level of output.

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:14.290 align:middle line:90%


00:46:14.290 --> 00:46:20.410 align:middle line:84%
OK, let me just say in words,
this is a particular q.

00:46:20.410 --> 00:46:23.020 align:middle line:84%
I could have picked another
one, which would minimize

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.170 align:middle line:90%
the cost of achieving that q.

00:46:25.170 --> 00:46:27.760 align:middle line:84%
And then we would
get cost curves,

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:30.680 align:middle line:84%
which are going to
show up momentarily.

00:46:30.680 --> 00:46:33.320 align:middle line:84%
But that was too much clutter
to put on the diagram,

00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:36.120 align:middle line:90%
so we didn't do it.

00:46:36.120 --> 00:46:40.020 align:middle line:84%
Instead, we put
on this, the idea

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:43.180 align:middle line:90%
of changing the ratio of costs.

00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:51.120 align:middle line:84%
So say Disney Company producing
movies uses humans, animators,

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:52.300 align:middle line:90%
and computers.

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:55.140 align:middle line:90%


00:46:55.140 --> 00:47:00.870 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] the year,
computers got cheaper relative

00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:03.370 align:middle line:90%
to the wages of humans.

00:47:03.370 --> 00:47:10.530 align:middle line:84%
So in the early 1900s,
1990s, the slope of this line

00:47:10.530 --> 00:47:14.400 align:middle line:84%
would be the cost
of computers divided

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.920 align:middle line:90%
by the cost of animators--

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.810 align:middle line:90%
relatively flat.

00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:22.470 align:middle line:84%
By today's standards,
the line is steeper.

00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:27.780 align:middle line:84%
So the cost of
computers, well-- it's--

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.930 align:middle line:84%
always have to remember,
it's like p1 over p2.

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:34.470 align:middle line:84%
So the cost of animators
relative to the cost

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:38.310 align:middle line:84%
of computers has
become a lot steeper.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:41.520 align:middle line:84%
And of course, you're seeing
different tangencies A and B.

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:44.730 align:middle line:84%
Naturally, Walt
Disney Company would

00:47:44.730 --> 00:47:48.570 align:middle line:84%
switch in the direction
of using the cheaper

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:53.640 align:middle line:84%
input, namely, computers at the
expense of using more humans.

00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.260 align:middle line:84%
So later, when we get
into international trade,

00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:57.720 align:middle line:90%
we're going to talk about--

00:47:57.720 --> 00:48:00.060 align:middle line:84%
we're going to talk about
changing factor prices

00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:04.050 align:middle line:84%
and wages and so on,
so this is motivation

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:06.660 align:middle line:90%
for that when we get there.

00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:11.320 align:middle line:84%
Cost function is
homogeneous of degree 1.

00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:14.500 align:middle line:84%
If you double the inputs,
you double the cost.

00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.780 align:middle line:90%
Same argument as before.

00:48:16.780 --> 00:48:18.520 align:middle line:84%
We're not going to
change the optimum.

00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:20.770 align:middle line:84%
We're just changing the
prices of the inputs,

00:48:20.770 --> 00:48:22.030 align:middle line:90%
so the cost doubles.

00:48:22.030 --> 00:48:25.030 align:middle line:84%
The cost function is continuous,
and the cost function

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:26.500 align:middle line:90%
is concave.

00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.190 align:middle line:84%
Just like we did that the
profit function was convex,

00:48:30.190 --> 00:48:33.190 align:middle line:84%
we're getting that this
cost function is concave.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And the argument
is very similar.

00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.570 align:middle line:84%
And instead of
chewing up time, I'm

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:40.720 align:middle line:84%
actually going to break
precedent and leave

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.300 align:middle line:84%
this for you to do,
but it's exactly

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:45.850 align:middle line:84%
the same argument
that we went through

00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:47.620 align:middle line:84%
with the convexity of
the profit function,

00:48:47.620 --> 00:48:49.660 align:middle line:90%
except the signs are--

00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:52.310 align:middle line:84%
the inequalities
go the other way.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:56.620 align:middle line:84%
OK, and then we get
Shepard's lemma,

00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:00.720 align:middle line:84%
which is a version of
Hotelling's lemma focusing

00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:05.310 align:middle line:84%
on costs, and hence only
on the inputs prices.

00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:10.260 align:middle line:84%
If we differentiate
the minimized cost

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:19.310 align:middle line:84%
of producing output level y with
respect to an input price w--

00:49:19.310 --> 00:49:22.070 align:middle line:84%
I pride myself on the ability
to go through these slides

00:49:22.070 --> 00:49:23.990 align:middle line:90%
and remove all the typos.

00:49:23.990 --> 00:49:26.870 align:middle line:84%
But here, I'm kind of
wishing that I had had

00:49:26.870 --> 00:49:31.340 align:middle line:90%
a wn on here because it's xn.

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.680 align:middle line:84%
So if there's only
one input, it's fine.

00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:35.840 align:middle line:84%
If there's multiple inputs,
then there's a vector,

00:49:35.840 --> 00:49:38.000 align:middle line:84%
and we should be
differentiating with respect

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.070 align:middle line:84%
to a particular item in the
vector, namely, the nth input.

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:46.960 align:middle line:84%
So probably better to
have written this as wn

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.860 align:middle line:90%
and have an xn over here.

00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:56.050 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, hopefully, we'll
take notes and correct that.

00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:57.360 align:middle line:90%
It's not wrong.

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:59.320 align:middle line:84%
It could have been
written better.

00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:02.450 align:middle line:84%
But the real point is
you've seen this before.

00:50:02.450 --> 00:50:04.390 align:middle line:84%
This is a version of
Hotelling's lemma.

00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:06.310 align:middle line:90%
It's called Shepard's lemma.

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.560 align:middle line:84%
But Shepard's only dealing
with cost function.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:11.970 align:middle line:84%
Hotelling was dealing with
the whole profit function.

00:50:11.970 --> 00:50:13.910 align:middle line:84%
So all that stuff about
the envelope theorem,

00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:16.010 align:middle line:84%
blah, blah, blah,
that all applies here.

00:50:16.010 --> 00:50:19.770 align:middle line:90%


00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:27.120 align:middle line:84%
Cost curves-- so we've got
the total cost of producing q

00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.640 align:middle line:84%
as the minimized
cost of producing q.

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:31.950 align:middle line:84%
The marginal cost is
the derivative of that.

00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:37.680 align:middle line:84%
And the average cost is total
cost divided by the quantity q.

00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:44.130 align:middle line:84%
That's the cost on average
of the various units of q.

00:50:44.130 --> 00:50:50.220 align:middle line:84%
Of course, profits would be
just the revenue minus the cost.

00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:53.250 align:middle line:84%
This is the minimized
cost function

00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:57.420 align:middle line:84%
suppressing the reference
to w as if it were fixed.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:01.410 align:middle line:84%
And take the derivative of this,
of course with respect to q,

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.450 align:middle line:84%
we're getting a price
on the left-hand side

00:51:03.450 --> 00:51:06.600 align:middle line:84%
and the marginal
cost on the right.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.930 align:middle line:84%
So again, this
has an intuitive--

00:51:08.930 --> 00:51:12.230 align:middle line:84%
you've probably seen this in
your principles of economics

00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:14.660 align:middle line:84%
course, that when the
firm is optimizing,

00:51:14.660 --> 00:51:17.390 align:middle line:84%
it should pick a
quantity q, where price

00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:19.610 align:middle line:90%
is equal to marginal cost.

00:51:19.610 --> 00:51:22.550 align:middle line:84%
And the reason is, of
course, if price were greater

00:51:22.550 --> 00:51:25.490 align:middle line:84%
than marginal cost,
you get more in revenue

00:51:25.490 --> 00:51:29.060 align:middle line:84%
for one more unit than you
sacrifice in terms of costs

00:51:29.060 --> 00:51:32.720 align:middle line:84%
and vice versa when
it goes the other way.

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:37.500 align:middle line:84%
In particular-- we're going to
get a strong property here--

00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.560 align:middle line:84%
when we have constant
returns to scale,

00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:45.840 align:middle line:84%
this production function you've
seen before, production set.

00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:50.680 align:middle line:84%
And the cost is
going to be linear.

00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:55.600 align:middle line:84%
It just scales up and
down as you vary q.

00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.790 align:middle line:84%
And in other words,
the marginal cost

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:01.220 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the
average cost, and we

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:04.250 align:middle line:84%
want to find the point when
you're optimizing the price

00:52:04.250 --> 00:52:07.550 align:middle line:84%
p is equal to the marginal
cost, which is also

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:08.920 align:middle line:90%
equal to the average cost.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:13.220 align:middle line:84%
So any price less
than that, you're

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.250 align:middle line:90%
like, no, I'm not doing it.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.550 align:middle line:84%
And any price greater, they
would go to infinity and make

00:52:19.550 --> 00:52:21.420 align:middle line:90%
an infinite amount of money.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.440 align:middle line:84%
And at this critical
price p, which is exactly

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.590 align:middle line:84%
equal to the constant
marginal cost,

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:31.040 align:middle line:84%
because the slope is the
same on this line everywhere,

00:52:31.040 --> 00:52:34.890 align:middle line:84%
they jump from 0 to any
old q that you want.

00:52:34.890 --> 00:52:37.250 align:middle line:84%
Let me show you the intuition
of what's going on here.

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.890 align:middle line:84%
Again, keep track of
what's in the numerator

00:52:39.890 --> 00:52:41.720 align:middle line:90%
and what's in the denominator.

00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:45.530 align:middle line:84%
This is supposed
to be p1 over p2.

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:52.400 align:middle line:84%
The slope of this isoprofit
line is p1 over p2.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:56.390 align:middle line:84%
If p2 is going up, this
isoprofit line slope

00:52:56.390 --> 00:52:58.620 align:middle line:90%
will be going down.

00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:01.710 align:middle line:84%
So let's compare the
three diagrams here.

00:53:01.710 --> 00:53:07.430 align:middle line:84%
So here, given a slope
associated with p1 over p2,

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:10.910 align:middle line:84%
profits just get
higher and higher

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:14.660 align:middle line:84%
as you move further and
further along the boundaries.

00:53:14.660 --> 00:53:18.300 align:middle line:90%
So 2 is the output.

00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:22.830 align:middle line:84%
So as p2 goes up, p1
over p2 is going down.

00:53:22.830 --> 00:53:26.330 align:middle line:84%
So we get this
isoprofit line, which

00:53:26.330 --> 00:53:30.560 align:middle line:84%
is actually coincident with the
boundary of the production set.

00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:33.230 align:middle line:84%
And finally, for--
so the mistake

00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:35.900 align:middle line:84%
here is this should
say going down.

00:53:35.900 --> 00:53:38.630 align:middle line:84%
I'm constantly catching
myself that it wasn't working

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:43.910 align:middle line:84%
that the slope is moving in
the direction of the opposite

00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:45.740 align:middle line:90%
of what I'm saying.

00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:50.510 align:middle line:84%
What we want here is a price
where they go-- or infinity

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:51.440 align:middle line:90%
over here.

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.230 align:middle line:84%
They're indifferent at
this price of output.

00:53:54.230 --> 00:53:56.210 align:middle line:84%
And at a lower price
of output, they,

00:53:56.210 --> 00:53:57.860 align:middle line:90%
don't want to do anything.

00:53:57.860 --> 00:54:01.280 align:middle line:84%
So [INAUDIBLE] nothing
[? pro ?] profit.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And that's where these lines are
steeper, where these isoprofit

00:54:05.090 --> 00:54:06.050 align:middle line:90%
lines are steeper.

00:54:06.050 --> 00:54:10.880 align:middle line:84%
And they're steeper because
it has a slope of p1 or p2.

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:13.190 align:middle line:84%
And the price of
output p2 has gotten

00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:18.500 align:middle line:84%
so low that these lines are
getting so steep that the best

00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:23.980 align:middle line:84%
position is zero profit, so I
finally set it right that time.

00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:26.020 align:middle line:84%
And I did not catch
this typo before.

00:54:26.020 --> 00:54:27.990 align:middle line:90%
We'll fix that.

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:31.320 align:middle line:84%
The point of the diagram is
constant returns to scale

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.990 align:middle line:84%
has some very
special properties.

00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:36.720 align:middle line:90%
Prices have to be just right.

00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:41.190 align:middle line:84%
If price ratio is just right,
then any production is fine,

00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:43.920 align:middle line:90%
and they're making zero profits.

00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.220 align:middle line:90%
So they don't care.

00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:49.810 align:middle line:84%
They will do something if
demand makes them do it.

00:54:49.810 --> 00:54:52.590 align:middle line:84%
But on these two extremes,
this isn't feasible

00:54:52.590 --> 00:54:54.210 align:middle line:90%
because it's infinite profit.

00:54:54.210 --> 00:54:56.050 align:middle line:84%
And here, they
would make losses,

00:54:56.050 --> 00:54:58.980 align:middle line:84%
so they minimize their
losses and go to 0.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:01.890 align:middle line:84%
So you get these very
extreme solutions.

00:55:01.890 --> 00:55:04.680 align:middle line:84%
If you have an equilibrium
with positive profits

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.040 align:middle line:84%
from a production set which
displays constant returns

00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:11.730 align:middle line:84%
to scale, you know
that the price ratio

00:55:11.730 --> 00:55:14.400 align:middle line:84%
has to be coincident with
the slope of the boundary

00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.340 align:middle line:90%
of the production function.

00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:21.280 align:middle line:84%
When we get to equilibrium,
we can determine prices

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:24.700 align:middle line:84%
from the production side,
at least on the premise

00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:26.245 align:middle line:90%
that something's being produced.

00:55:26.245 --> 00:55:29.290 align:middle line:90%


00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:32.400 align:middle line:90%
That's what I said.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.450 align:middle line:84%
This is a property of
constant returns to scale.

00:55:36.450 --> 00:55:41.820 align:middle line:84%
Namely, we might just as well
solve the cost minimization

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:47.400 align:middle line:84%
problem for an output
of 1 and get the ratio

00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.450 align:middle line:90%
of the inputs that way.

00:55:49.450 --> 00:55:51.510 align:middle line:84%
And then, if you want
to scale production

00:55:51.510 --> 00:55:56.010 align:middle line:84%
up or down, y being greater than
or less than 1, that's fine.

00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:58.140 align:middle line:84%
You'll change the
level of the inputs.

00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:02.130 align:middle line:84%
They're going to scale up and
down as well by the same scalar

00:56:02.130 --> 00:56:06.840 align:middle line:84%
you're using to scale y, but
the ratio isn't going to move.

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:10.080 align:middle line:84%
But that's a property of
constant returns to scale.

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.380 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, I had
decided this in advance

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:17.640 align:middle line:84%
and, indeed, have my
eyes on the clock here.

00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:19.150 align:middle line:90%
There is a proof here.

00:56:19.150 --> 00:56:23.730 align:middle line:84%
So if you like, take some
time and try to write out

00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:25.260 align:middle line:90%
a proof by contradiction.

00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:28.560 align:middle line:84%
I think you'll find that
to be a useful exercise.

00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.050 align:middle line:84%
In other words,
prove something like

00:56:31.050 --> 00:56:35.260 align:middle line:84%
suppose you changed y and the
input ratio were to change,

00:56:35.260 --> 00:56:38.760 align:middle line:84%
then that would lead to a
contradiction, something

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:41.190 align:middle line:84%
inconsistent with
constant returns to scale.

00:56:41.190 --> 00:56:44.550 align:middle line:84%
All right, here's
Robinson Crusoe.

00:56:44.550 --> 00:56:47.550 align:middle line:84%
It's like a one-island,
one-man economy.

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:51.840 align:middle line:84%
If you don't the story,
this means nothing to you.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.960 align:middle line:84%
I think he actually had
a helper called Friday.

00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.980 align:middle line:84%
But anyway, just think
of Robinson Crusoe being

00:56:58.980 --> 00:57:04.020 align:middle line:84%
a one-man economy, and we plot
the production possibility set

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:08.850 align:middle line:84%
with Robinson's input, getting
food as output, picking fruit

00:57:08.850 --> 00:57:10.710 align:middle line:90%
off the trees, whatever.

00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:15.240 align:middle line:84%
And what's the maximal
solution for Robinson?

00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.460 align:middle line:84%
It's to find the
utility function which

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.010 align:middle line:90%
has the highest tangency.

00:57:20.010 --> 00:57:25.170 align:middle line:84%
So these lines are the curves
of indifference curves,

00:57:25.170 --> 00:57:30.420 align:middle line:84%
and the maximal utility
level is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:33.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is kind of a big
moment in the course,

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.060 align:middle line:84%
even though the
concepts probably

00:57:36.060 --> 00:57:38.190 align:middle line:90%
look pretty transparent.

00:57:38.190 --> 00:57:43.260 align:middle line:84%
We just combined utility
maximization with production.

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:48.000 align:middle line:84%
And I'm telling you, the optimum
point for the whole economy

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.040 align:middle line:90%
is this tangency level.

00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:54.900 align:middle line:84%
And, actually, if
we drew a line that

00:57:54.900 --> 00:57:57.030 align:middle line:84%
were tangent to
both the production

00:57:57.030 --> 00:57:59.370 align:middle line:84%
boundary and the
indifference curve,

00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:03.690 align:middle line:84%
that could represent
both a profit line

00:58:03.690 --> 00:58:08.190 align:middle line:84%
for Robinson Crusoe, the
producer, and a budget line

00:58:08.190 --> 00:58:11.140 align:middle line:84%
for Robinson Crusoe
as a consumer.

00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.750 align:middle line:84%
So for the first
time, we're actually

00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:14.700 align:middle line:84%
looking at a
competitive equilibrium

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:15.900 align:middle line:90%
for the whole economy.

00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:19.030 align:middle line:84%
It's kind of stupid, though,
because Robinson's all alone.

00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:21.180 align:middle line:90%
There's no one to trade with.

00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:24.650 align:middle line:90%
But suppose he could.

00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:27.710 align:middle line:84%
So suppose Robinson
Crusoe could produce

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:31.300 align:middle line:84%
two goods, some
agricultural output,

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:36.280 align:middle line:84%
but also some tools or
some manufactured good

00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.260 align:middle line:90%
on the x-axis.

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:42.480 align:middle line:84%
So the set of
production possibilities

00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:49.060 align:middle line:84%
is this quarter circle
area with its boundary.

00:58:49.060 --> 00:58:54.330 align:middle line:84%
And if Robinson Crusoe would
be still intent on maximizing

00:58:54.330 --> 00:58:58.260 align:middle line:84%
utility, we'd find where the
slope of the-- where the--

00:58:58.260 --> 00:59:00.270 align:middle line:84%
we'd find the highest
level of the indifference

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:03.925 align:middle line:90%
curve and the tangency.

00:59:03.925 --> 00:59:05.800 align:middle line:84%
There's stuff going on
in the background here

00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:08.490 align:middle line:84%
I'm not showing you
to make it simpler.

00:59:08.490 --> 00:59:12.810 align:middle line:90%
I'm not talking about his input.

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:15.780 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] whether I'm going
to work in agriculture or work

00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:19.880 align:middle line:84%
in manufacturing, and I'm not
showing you that work level.

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:24.650 align:middle line:84%
But it is producing this set
of production possibilities

00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:27.230 align:middle line:84%
of the two goods,
and this would be

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:30.200 align:middle line:90%
the utility maximizing point A.

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:34.520 align:middle line:84%
Now, suppose all of a sudden,
he has the opportunity

00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:36.530 align:middle line:90%
to trade with another island.

00:59:36.530 --> 00:59:46.280 align:middle line:84%
And suppose we represent
the isoprofit line in red.

00:59:46.280 --> 00:59:52.930 align:middle line:84%
So we want to be as far to
the northeast as possible,

00:59:52.930 --> 00:59:58.290 align:middle line:84%
maximizing profits, but staying
on the production possibility

00:59:58.290 --> 00:59:58.840 align:middle line:90%
set.

00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:03.700 align:middle line:84%
So that maximized
level of production

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:08.440 align:middle line:84%
is here, B, and
consumption is here, C.

01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:11.290 align:middle line:84%
Now, this is a much
more interesting economy

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:13.960 align:middle line:84%
because there's some
external agent here.

01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:16.150 align:middle line:84%
[INAUDIBLE] Robinson
Crusoe and the rest

01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:17.590 align:middle line:90%
of the world, that other island.

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:23.020 align:middle line:84%
And they're now trading
with each other.

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:27.710 align:middle line:84%
And Robinson Crusoe has
decided to specialize more,

01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:33.440 align:middle line:84%
though not completely,
in manufacturing goods

01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:38.570 align:middle line:84%
and to give them up in
trade to the other island

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:42.550 align:middle line:84%
in order to acquire more
agricultural output.

01:00:42.550 --> 01:00:47.610 align:middle line:84%
So we're seeing exports and
imports as we move from B to C.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:52.980 align:middle line:84%
And, obviously, Robinson Crusoe
is doing better utility wise

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:55.860 align:middle line:90%
from trade than that autarky.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.710 align:middle line:90%
A might stand for autarky.

01:00:58.710 --> 01:01:02.220 align:middle line:84%
So this is our first glimpse
at the gains from trade.

01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:03.990 align:middle line:84%
With the one-man
economy, at least,

01:01:03.990 --> 01:01:07.830 align:middle line:84%
Robinson Crusoe can be
made better off by trading

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.880 align:middle line:90%
with another island.

01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:12.430 align:middle line:90%
This is a related picture.

01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:16.240 align:middle line:84%
Suppose we have two countries,
the UK and the United States,

01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:18.820 align:middle line:84%
and their production
possibility set

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:21.730 align:middle line:90%
look different from each other.

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:25.930 align:middle line:84%
We're plotting wheat and
cloth in both countries,

01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:32.470 align:middle line:84%
and we might have an autarky
that the UK's maximal utility

01:01:32.470 --> 01:01:38.950 align:middle line:84%
position is here at DUK, and
that the US's no-trade position

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.900 align:middle line:90%
would be at DUS.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:43.600 align:middle line:84%
Now, you do see that
this is deliberately

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:47.950 align:middle line:84%
chosen so the slopes of
these lines are different,

01:01:47.950 --> 01:01:50.570 align:middle line:84%
and that suggests there
are gains to trade.

01:01:50.570 --> 01:01:54.310 align:middle line:84%
In fact, what's depicted
here is almost common

01:01:54.310 --> 01:01:58.960 align:middle line:84%
price ratio, where you could
think of it as the prices

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.130 align:middle line:90%
in the rest of the world.

01:02:00.130 --> 01:02:02.800 align:middle line:84%
But this may be a
bilateral country example,

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.130 align:middle line:84%
but somehow the prices
are fixed for each country

01:02:06.130 --> 01:02:07.700 align:middle line:90%
by competitive forces.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.900 align:middle line:84%
So the slope of the dashed line
is the same for both countries.

01:02:11.900 --> 01:02:12.950 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:19.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, the UK decides to
export wheat and import cloth.

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:22.210 align:middle line:84%
I thought it was going to
go the other way, actually.

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:26.005 align:middle line:84%
And the United
States chooses to--

01:02:26.005 --> 01:02:27.700 align:middle line:90%
did I just say that wrong--

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:31.180 align:middle line:84%
chooses to-- oh, yeah,
I did say it wrong.

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:35.860 align:middle line:84%
The US chooses to produce
more wheat and export

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:40.510 align:middle line:84%
part of that increased
production back to the UK.

01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:43.990 align:middle line:84%
The UK was here in
autarky, when it

01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:46.630 align:middle line:84%
faced with the
possibility of trade,

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:49.660 align:middle line:84%
it produces much
more cloth, and then

01:02:49.660 --> 01:02:53.020 align:middle line:90%
it exports that cloth to the US.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:55.840 align:middle line:84%
Cloth and the UK
kind go hand-in-hand

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:58.540 align:middle line:84%
because people think of
the Industrial Revolution

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:01.420 align:middle line:84%
and manufacturing
of textiles, which

01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.870 align:middle line:84%
was kind over big deal in
Britain, and the US and Kansas

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:07.970 align:middle line:90%
and so on having lots of wheat.

01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:11.080 align:middle line:84%
So it's meant to be a
somewhat realistic example.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.260 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, this is the
climax of the slides today

01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:17.620 align:middle line:84%
because you're seeing an
application of production

01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:20.890 align:middle line:84%
theory, in particular, a
profit maximizing theory,

01:03:20.890 --> 01:03:24.880 align:middle line:84%
but now integrating with
utility maximization theory

01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:29.890 align:middle line:84%
and looking at an equilibrium
of an entire economy, at least

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.720 align:middle line:90%
consisting of two countries.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:36.580 align:middle line:84%
When we talk about tariffs
and taxes and so on,

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:43.420 align:middle line:84%
these dashed lines will
not be of identical slope.

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.420 align:middle line:84%
They're going to have different
slopes in different countries,

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:50.590 align:middle line:84%
depending on which good
is subject to a tariff.

01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:53.140 align:middle line:84%
Imports from China
coming into the US,

01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.970 align:middle line:84%
for example, are
subject to a tariff.

01:03:54.970 --> 01:03:58.990 align:middle line:84%
And we'll get there, but
we're getting very close now.

01:03:58.990 --> 01:04:03.520 align:middle line:84%
So there is more to this part
of the lecture on production,

01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:09.220 align:middle line:84%
but I preplanned to stop here to
say, next time, when we start,

01:04:09.220 --> 01:04:15.380 align:middle line:84%
we'll finish up this production
lecture on Leontief and Google,

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:23.110 align:middle line:84%
Facebook page rank, I mean, and
the great Japanese earthquake,

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:25.090 align:middle line:90%
and then we'll--

01:04:25.090 --> 01:04:28.340 align:middle line:84%
which are fun applications
for production.

01:04:28.340 --> 01:04:33.700 align:middle line:84%
And then we're going to
go to lecture 5 and talk

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:35.620 align:middle line:84%
about the consumer
theory and then

01:04:35.620 --> 01:04:38.140 align:middle line:84%
combine them all over
again with some techniques

01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:40.510 align:middle line:90%
on linear programming.

01:04:40.510 --> 01:04:43.200 align:middle line:90%
OK, see you soon.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:56.053 align:middle line:90%

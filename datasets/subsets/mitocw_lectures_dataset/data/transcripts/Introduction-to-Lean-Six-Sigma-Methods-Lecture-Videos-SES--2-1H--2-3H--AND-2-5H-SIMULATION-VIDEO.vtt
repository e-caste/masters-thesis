00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.460
HUGH MCMANUS: This
video is intended

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.030
to describe some of the key
features of the Lean Enterprise

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.210
Value Lean Healthcare
Clinic Simulation.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.050
A video can't substitute for
the experience of attending

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.990
an intense learning
simulation such as this one,

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.400
and we won't attempt to do that.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.830
Instead, what we're
going to do is

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.640
describe what the students
experience during the day,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.610
cover at least some of the
lessons of what they learn,

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.670
and for those of you that are
interested in simulation-based

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.240
education, describe some of
the features of the learning

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.350
simulation.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.240
The simulation
itself and this video

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.060
are broken into three
pieces, three modules.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.670
One is the learning of
the simulation itself.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.910
It's accompanied by some
background information

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.750
in how Lean applies to health
care and some simple tools

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.840
for getting local
processes under control.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.850
The second is a
structured improvement

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.970
using Value Stream Mapping,
Capacity Calculation,

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.620
and a Planned Improvement Method
to improve the local processes

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.720
at each clinic to make
them at least functional.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.160
And the third attacks problems
that cannot be handled

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.870
at the individual clinics.

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.290
And in this exercise, the
entire group of students

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.910
participates in a simulated
Rapid Process Improvement

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:46.000
Workshop where they break
down into functional teams

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.270
and do a complete reengineering
of the clinic process

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.840
across the whole room with
cooperation between clinics

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.610
in order to solve
some problems that

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.500
are unsolvable at
the local level,

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.910
and also create a overall
very high-performing clinic

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.320
environment.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.680
Basically, what you are
in our simulated world

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.289
is a group of
outpatient clinics.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.280
We have an old process
that is not very good.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.510
There's high variation in
workload in the processes.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.620
The overall performance
is pretty poor.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.620
We're going to actually
let you experience that.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.720
You're going to play with it.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.820
Maybe for a little while you'll
be learning how to do it.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.500
But it's not that complicated.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.110
You should be able to learn
your own jobs pretty quickly.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.610
But then you will
find that it still

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.000
doesn't work very well because
the system itself is set up

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.440
not very well.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.690
At that point, the simulation,
once you've learned it,

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.150
becomes a practice field for
applying Lean techniques.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.458
What can we do to make
this process better?

00:02:45.458 --> 00:02:46.750
This is what we're going to do.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.820
We're going to have
basically three segments.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.100
The segments will have one
or two rounds of play each.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.850
We're going to first
learn the simulation.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.380
That's what we're
doing right now.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.440
We're going to apply Lean
locally at each of your tables.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.500
You will strategize and
apply some Lean interventions

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.920
to make your individual
clinic work better.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.960
And then we're going to
do another round where

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.630
we start thinking about, well,
there's only so much one can

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:11.620
do locally.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.050
What are some of
the things that we

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.540
can do by coordinating
across our whole health care

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.210
enterprise by expanding our
vision of the value stream

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:24.070
beyond just the one clinic so
that the whole room can work

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.530
together to make a more
efficient system that,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.240
for example, shares resources
or redirects patients to places

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.580
that are better able
to take care of them.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.780
What we're gonna do in this
module is first of all,

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.500
just learn how to play the
simulation because the idea

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.870
that we would like you to
get is to think about this

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.660
as a process that mirrors--

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.210
perhaps does not exactly
simulate-- but mirrors

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.070
the kind of process that
you'd see in a clinic or ER

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.450
where a patient is flowing
through the system.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:59.200
And we're trying to
get that patient value

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.850
stream to be lean.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:02.350
So we're gonna learn
the simulation.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.200
We're going to experience the
frustrations of a not very

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.030
good process and
apply a couple simple

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.380
Lean tools to try to get
it to at least perform

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.640
at a minimum level.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.160
Key thing right now, though,
is to kind of wrap your brain

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.899
around the Sim so
that we can stop

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:19.810
thinking about it, because later
in the day, what we would like

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.150
to do is think about
this as a process

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.970
and apply Lean tools
and analyses to it so

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.660
that the game, as it were, sort
of fades into the background,

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.200
and we worry more about
the realities of the tools

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.810
and using them to improve
the process that's

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.072
embodied in the simulation.

00:04:37.072 --> 00:04:38.530
The rules are very
straightforward.

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:41.470
And in fact, they are
pretty much in front of you.

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.770
If everyone has a mat in front
of them that says Process,

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.370
and if you just read that
and execute those actions

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.930
faithfully, you'll be fine.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.200
It's important that you
do that because that's

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.900
the basis for
future improvements.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.430
If you don't
understand the process,

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.138
it's going to be
difficult to improve it.

00:04:59.138 --> 00:04:59.950
So Round 1.

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.600
And the minute is the time.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.270
You will now be
referring to this

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.360
rather than making
those times up.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.370
You have 12 minutes
to get things done.

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.190
If you are not
done in 12 minutes,

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.290
you can no longer
process, you can no longer

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.970
register any new patients.

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.800
But you have 3
minutes of overtime

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.720
to finish the existing patients.

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.170
And I will reset the
clock at that time,

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.220
and then we'll count
up to 3 minutes.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.710
So ready and go.

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.030
This montage will illustrate
some of the features

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.310
of the simulation.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.560
AUDIENCE: Oh, it's a long one.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.950
HUGH MCMANUS: The simulation
involves the processing

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:40.040
of little LEGO
people, LEGO patients,

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.190
through a simulated clinic
with various functions

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.650
such as registration, triage,
examination, diagnosis,

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:49.640
and discharge.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.580
The simulation has a
fair amount of paperwork.

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.950
A lot of it is a
little frustrating,

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.330
a little bit redundant.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:58.650
Some of it is
unnecessarily complicated,

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.120
although the paperwork does
have important information that

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.560
affects the flow of the
patients and their treatment.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.920
Timers are used to represent
the capacity of the system

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.020
so it doesn't turn into a
race to get things done,

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.200
although physical dexterity
is sometimes required.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.200
There are a lot of manual steps.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.905
But the basic processes are
represented by the timers.

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:29.960
And those are ultimately
the constraints

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:33.980
on the system that allows the
students to focus ultimately

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.720
on the process itself
rather than the details.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.390
The variation in the
system is represented

00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:42.840
a couple of different ways.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.870
One is by the patient himself.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.420
The little LEGO patient has
different colors of head,

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.680
body, and legs that
affect the diagnosis.

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.340
This is the "each patient
is different" phenomena.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.740
The actual process
variation is represented

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.870
by dice that create a
unpredictable source

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.670
of variation in each station.

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:07.640
And these can
affect both the time

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.300
it takes to process
the individual patient

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.700
and in some cases, in
the case of diagnosis,

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:17.420
the dice can indicate whether
a test is failed or passed,

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.430
or whether the machine
fails to perform

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.162
and the test has
to be done over.

00:07:21.162 --> 00:07:23.120
AUDIENCE: There's a
patient number at the top--

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.950
HUGH MCMANUS: The
patients sometimes

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.952
have to leave the table and
go to a little LEGO hospital.

00:07:28.952 --> 00:07:29.910
AUDIENCE: I'll be back.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.140
HUGH MCMANUS: So there are some
externalities to the system.

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:37.220
Sometimes the clinic cannot
handle a given patient.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.655
There are other
times when patients

00:07:39.655 --> 00:07:41.030
don't have to go
to the hospital,

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.150
but nevertheless due to
lack of either capacity

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.290
or the correct equipment, they
can't be treated at the clinic,

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:50.420
and therefore, the
clinic effectively

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:51.920
fails to treat the patient.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:53.960
These are things
that are eventually

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.900
dealt with in the last
round of the simulation.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:00.800
As the first round or
two go on, the students

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.790
do learn to master
their own processes.

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:07.640
But it still remains a
little bit confusing.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.870
The process is not
a very good one.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:16.100
And so but the students get past
the simulation rules and start

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.950
thinking about what is
wrong with this process.

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:20.690
What's the overall flow?

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:22.890
And what is the purpose
of the paperwork?

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.950
And what are the
sources of variation?

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:27.470
And how can we make
this process better?

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.040
OK.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.150
Regular time is done.

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.900
We are starting
overtime, 3 minutes.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.140
No new patients
may be registered.

00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.090
The simulation uses
overtime basically

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:42.140
to clear patients off the
table so that it's not

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:43.970
a continuing state simulation.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.902
AUDIENCE: It failed test.

00:08:45.902 --> 00:08:46.970
Yellow timer.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.470
AUDIENCE: This is
like the blindfold

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:49.640
where everybody [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.098
HUGH MCMANUS:
Basically, the clinic

00:08:51.098 --> 00:08:52.970
closes down for the night.

00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:57.750
This allows a completion of
the metrics for each day--

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.250
OK.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:00.590
So if there's any patients
still out on the floor,

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.630
they're going to be
recorded as untreated.

00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:06.530
--and also makes it simpler
to execute the simulation.

00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:08.420
You don't have patients
that are mysteriously

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.295
trapped in the clinic overnight.

00:09:10.295 --> 00:09:13.040
Unfinished patients and
any unfinished paperwork

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.698
to that person to just put away.

00:09:15.698 --> 00:09:16.490
That would be good.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:17.782
We're going to clear the table.

00:09:17.782 --> 00:09:21.380
And what we'd like you to do
is put patients and errors.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:24.260
That's untreated patients,
not-- hospital's OK.

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:26.030
But untreated
patients or patients

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:27.530
that were treated incorrectly.

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:29.450
We can use visual control.

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.730
Anybody who's been in a
hospital has seen these kind

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:34.010
of scheduling boards.

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:37.970
Students now use visual
controls and intuitive small

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:41.090
improvements in standardizations
in their process

00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:43.550
to make it perform a
little bit better at least,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:46.410
to make it perform not
quite so chaotically.

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:46.910
All righty.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:47.810
Round 2.

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:48.310
Go.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.380
And try the process again.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.220
Typically, improvements
are noticeable but small.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.110
And at the end of
this process, students

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.770
are encouraged to share their
various ideas with the larger

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:01.370
group.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:03.260
Let's total up our
statistics, put them up.

00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.220
So that they can take
some ownership of it.

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.330
So that the larger group
can see the variety

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.400
of different improvement
ideas that people

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.770
can come up with just
sort of creatively

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.223
in the first
improvement attempt.

00:10:14.223 --> 00:10:15.890
AUDIENCE: Pretend it
was width to width.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:16.310
HUGH MCMANUS: OK.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:16.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.420
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.360
We did the same thing.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.450
And we actually
used sticky labels.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:23.120
AUDIENCE: We did the
similar kind of thing.

00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.938
AUDIENCE: MV, lab, triage.

00:10:24.938 --> 00:10:25.730
HUGH MCMANUS: Yeah.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.790
So great.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:30.230
In the second module of
the simulation experience,

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:32.600
the students receive
some lecture material

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:35.300
and then embark on
a major exercise.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.600
The process is analyzed
using value stream mapping,

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:43.280
some gemba visits where people
look at how the process work

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.800
in detail on the table.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.190
And also, they do
some analysis by using

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.800
capacity calculations
and other calculations

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.700
to try to understand the
capacity and other features

00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.100
of the simulation
quantitatively.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.920
They then go through a
structured improvement process

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:04.070
where ideas are brainstormed,
costs are figured out,

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:06.130
and an improvement
approach is agreed upon.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:06.630
OK.

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.340
It is Round 3.

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:08.210
Let's go.

00:11:08.210 --> 00:11:11.120
These improvements are
done at the single table

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:12.610
level, the single clinic level.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:14.110
AUDIENCE: So Tom,
the next patient--

00:11:14.110 --> 00:11:14.250
AUDIENCE: Registration.

00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:14.770
We have a new patient.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:17.480
AUDIENCE: Can you take that
patient to registration, Tom?

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.970
HUGH MCMANUS: No interaction
between the clinics

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:21.810
is done at this time.

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:27.830
So the attempt is to locally
optimize the process.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:32.090
With the new process, the
tables are quieter, calmer.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:34.520
The work seems to be
proceeding in a little bit more

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.410
of an organized way.

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:37.160
AUDIENCE: Lab, don't
forget your end time.

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.550
You're gonna put you end time--

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:41.330
HUGH MCMANUS: There's
even time for the students

00:11:41.330 --> 00:11:45.050
to improve their process
and organize their workspace

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:46.545
while the work is going on.

00:11:46.545 --> 00:11:48.170
AUDIENCE: Who's doing
discharge for me?

00:11:48.170 --> 00:11:49.070
Nobody?

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.930
Clogged on discharge.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:53.120
HUGH MCMANUS: The
result is almost always

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:54.476
better performance.

00:11:54.476 --> 00:11:56.650
AUDIENCE: This is so fun.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:57.740
HUGH MCMANUS: All right.

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:58.700
That's it.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:03.020
Although there is significant
variation by table,

00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.350
not every clinic
shows improvement

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:10.010
in their process based on the
ideas that they implemented.

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:12.200
Successfully treated?

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.935
So six here, three there.

00:12:13.935 --> 00:12:15.562
Let's go, guys.

00:12:15.562 --> 00:12:17.820
[SIDE CONVERSATIONS]

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.540
So we had the problem at
the doctor getting worse.

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.370
And that was an external
condition, right?

00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:24.290
You just got more gray patients.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:25.070
Right?

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:28.520
You guys kind of had
bad luck, more bad roles

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:32.030
on the diagnostics.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:33.500
You folks, things clicked.

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:34.400
Right?

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:35.810
The process change worked.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:37.340
Your luck was reasonable.

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:38.310
Things clicked.

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:38.810
All right.

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:39.580
Everybody ready?

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.580
Seems very quiet.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.540
I think we're ready.

00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:42.770
Let's go.

00:12:42.770 --> 00:12:45.320
To stabilize the new process
and collect a little bit

00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.300
more information
on its performance,

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:50.420
the simulation is run
again using a new process.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:52.870
Typically, performance
is good or better

00:12:52.870 --> 00:12:54.560
than the previous round.

00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:57.740
However, the performance
varies by table, still.

00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.750
And the students
observe that there's

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:04.130
high variation and factors
beyond their control, which

00:13:04.130 --> 00:13:06.350
are still limiting their
performance to a level

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:07.580
lower than they would like.

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.950
Didn't ultimately have
success in this round.

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:12.915
They have identified
a shifted constraint.

00:13:12.915 --> 00:13:15.290
These guys are definitely
getting better, and same thing.

00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:16.520
Right?

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.300
Shift.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:18.800
They've identified
the same problem.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.480
You guys, everything
was going great.

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.340
Is there anything--
if I asked you to do

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.590
10, what would be the problem?

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:25.310
Oh, OK.

00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:27.840
So it was a bottleneck at the
discharge at the end there.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:28.340
OK.

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.950
AUDIENCE: We had a lot of
bad luck in our failed tests.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:32.120
In failed tests.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.050
OK.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:34.280
Everybody had bad luck.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.490
What does that tell you?

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:35.990
Yep.

00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.890
It's the new normal.

00:13:36.890 --> 00:13:37.550
Right.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:41.240
So we're going to do a
mock RPW to make this work.

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.120
Here is our electronic records.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:44.870
We don't have to do
the paperwork anymore.

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:45.680
That's good.

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.040
Let's set up some
cross-functional teams.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:51.680
First of all, let's figure
out what our plan is.

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:52.610
OK.

00:13:52.610 --> 00:13:53.750
And there's your team.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.620
So go to it.

00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.490
The challenge in the final
round of the simulation

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.310
is to succeed in only
one round of play.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:05.910
There isn't a second round
to stabilize the new process.

00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:09.290
This requires the students
to focus on the process.

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:13.130
It's designed to do
a good job, but it

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:16.520
must be executed
carefully and successfully

00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.500
in order for the
students to have

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.570
good performance
in the first round

00:14:20.570 --> 00:14:23.690
after implementing
a lot of changes.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:28.352
Visual controls and constant
communication ensure success.

00:14:28.352 --> 00:14:29.810
AUDIENCE: This
patient is our team.

00:14:29.810 --> 00:14:31.075

00:14:31.075 --> 00:14:31.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.300

We're going overtime.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.220
Yeah.

00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.900
The last patient is
winding their way

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:11.400
through the otherwise
empty clinic.

00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:11.900
Right?

00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:15.080
It's gone from being a mob scene
to being like, it's one person.

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.910
The thing that
worked really well

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:19.910
was the fact that you
had this simple system.

00:15:19.910 --> 00:15:22.190
There was a lot of
yelling, but everyone

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:25.073
could see what was going on,
and everyone was communicating.

00:15:25.073 --> 00:15:26.240
Like, it's they're finished!

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.948
They're finished!

00:15:26.948 --> 00:15:28.040
Hello!

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.840
But the information
got transferred.

00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:30.950
I thought that was key.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.890
And the other thing is
the diagnostician team

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:38.150
did a super job of
both figuring out

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:39.860
how to optimize that system--

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:41.445
good job, diagnosticians.

00:15:41.445 --> 00:15:43.400
Our final discussion
highlights what

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.340
works about the new
process and also

00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:48.530
in the spirit of
continuous improvement,

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:52.520
mentions what could be
improved if the simulation was

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.320
to keep going.

of a [INAUDIBLE] OPIW.

happen in a week.

It's not yet ready for
full scale implementation.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.840
You're going to have to refine
it, get the training ready--

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.100
HUGH MCMANUS: It's probably
going to be pretty ragged.

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:07.400
Yes.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.430
AUDIENCE: But at
the end of the week,

00:16:08.430 --> 00:16:11.000
you would have gotten a whole
new system developed and tested

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:12.200
to this stage.

00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:13.342
And that's what you did.

00:16:13.342 --> 00:16:15.050
So that's what we're
doing at the moment.

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:17.092
HUGH MCMANUS: It's about
this frantic for a week.

00:16:17.092 --> 00:16:18.747
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:16:18.747 --> 00:16:19.580
GUEST SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.120
That is why you need to
test your implementation.

00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:25.340
This way we're
spending half a year

00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:27.140
planning the perfect solution.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.770
It does not work because you
can't anticipate those things.

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.390
So you launch, you look at what
doesn't work, and you fix it.

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.410
You relaunch.

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:39.140
And that's how you just
run through the cycles.

00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:40.610
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE] cycles.

00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:44.300
GUEST SPEAKER: Forget your
health care upbringing with,

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.360
let's study this for half
a year or a full year.

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:50.390
Let's spend another half a year
designing the perfect solution

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:52.490
and then evaluate
after another year.

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.170
That's not a good
way of doing it.

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.200
Do it this way.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.660
YEN-JIE LEE: OK, so
welcome back to 803.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.280
Happy to see you again.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.564
So today, we are going to
continue our discussion

00:00:32.564 --> 00:00:34.770
of dispersive medium.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.900
And there are two
questions we are

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.420
going to ask in
this lecture, and we

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.190
will answer also these two
questions in this lecture.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.440
So just to warn you in
advance, this lecture

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.640
will have a lot of mathematics,
so fasten the seatbelt

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.380
and follow me.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.320
And stop me any time
you don't feel like you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.560
know you understand something.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.840
So let's get started.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.790
OK, so today, we are going
to talk about phenomena

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.890
related to dispersion.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.740
And last time, we
started a discussion

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.980
about how to send
information from one

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.600
place to the other place right.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.550
So what we should be before
was to send square pulse.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:33.210
So if I do have a machine which
can produce a square pulse,

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.770
then I can define
something like this.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.350
So over some ratio,
which I set, I

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.470
can actually separate 0 and 1.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.700
So if I have a pulse
which is actually

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.110
having an amplitude greater
than some threshold and I say,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.120
OK, I've got 1, and
if it's actually

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.230
below some straight line,
say, OK, I've got a 0.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.350
And with that way, we
actually can send information

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.570
from one place to
the other place.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.770
So that sounds really nice.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:09.130
However, if we work on
a dispersive medium,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.580
which is really very common--

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.980
for example, light
and gas is actually--

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.810
not all the lights with
different wavelengths are

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.340
traveling at the
same speed, and also,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.906
as you've seen before in
the p-set, deep water,

00:02:30.906 --> 00:02:36.765
and also the strings,
considering a realistic string

00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:40.380
with stiffness, et
cetera, et cetera--

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.490
to the wavelength of the
input wave is going to affect

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.340
the speed of this
travelling wave.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.540
So in short, the speed
of the wave propagation

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.230
in a dispersive medium will
depend on the wavelengths

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.410
of this wave.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:03.780
So that brings us
a lot of trouble

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.310
because, for example, here we
are trying to send a Gaussian

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.260
pulse through the
medium, but after a while

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.130
this pulse actually becomes
wider and wider because

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.240
of the dispersion.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.810
Because all the components
with different wavelengths

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.140
which actually construct
this narrow pulse,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.920
actually are traveling
at different speeds.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.670
Therefore, if you
wait long enough,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:40.300
all the different frequencies,
or all the different frequency

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.290
harmonic waves are travel
at different speeds,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.080
therefore you get
the, dispersion,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.300
which results in a much
wider pulse in the end.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.950
And at some point,
this pulse is going

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.670
to be really wide,
such that it's actually

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.460
going to be very difficult
to separate 0 from 1.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.110
So that's the problem.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.260
And we also did some
simulations with computer.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.860
We do see this behavior also
in our computer simulation.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.839
If I put in triangular pulse
and allow it to evolve,

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:19.680
and like what we did
before, we assume

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.070
that there's a stiffness
in this string system.

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.510
And you will see that,
OK, as a function of time,

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:31.290
this part is now longer
a triangular shape,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.170
but you have a very
complicated structure.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.710
So that is actually
a problem we are

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.920
going to try to solve today.

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.250
And during that discussion
last time, in the lecture,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:49.360
we also introduced dispersion
relation omega k and also tried

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.920
to overlap two travelling
waves with similar wavelengths.

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.520
And that would give
you beat phenomenon.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.852
That probably doesn't
surprise you any more.

00:05:02.852 --> 00:05:05.820
As you can see
from this example,

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.770
you have the beat
phenomenon, and you

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.640
can see the amplitude is
actually variating slowly,

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.210
the function of position.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:18.400
And if you follow the red
point, which is actually

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.220
associated with one of the
peak, in the structure called

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.690
carrier, OK, it's
actually moving

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:32.390
at the phase velocity, the P,
which we introduced last time.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.540
The formula for BP, which is
actually the speed of harmonic,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.935
oscillating travelling wave is
actually defined as vp equal

00:05:42.935 --> 00:05:48.350
to omega over k,
and the green point,

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.540
which actually always at the
minima of the distribution,

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.730
which is actually associated
with the speed of the envelope.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:01.520
You can see that,
indeed, it actually

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.310
can move at different speeds.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.460
It depends on the
dispersion relation omega

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.250
as a function of k you
have in this system.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:16.100
And we call the speed
of these envelope,

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.120
which we construct from these
two overlapping travelling

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.630
waves to be--

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:25.130
we call it group velocity.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.130
And the definition
of group velocity

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.310
is vg equal to d omega dk.

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.480
So that's what we have
learned last time.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:41.720
OK, you may ask, OK, what
do I mean by group velocity?

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.500
And can I use it
beyond what we have

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.830
done for the beat phenomena.

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:52.240
But what do I mean
by group velocity?

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:54.270
Is that really useful,
and it's actually

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.650
which part of the structure
I was talking about.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:02.780
So in that case of two
overlapping progressing waves

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.410
with similar length
or similar frequency,

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.360
when we see that the
group velocity actually

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.080
present the speed of
the envelope, right?

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.070
Can we actually
learn something more

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.570
general about group velocity?

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:19.430
The second question
which we are asking

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:24.800
is, OK, now we have this
problem of dispersion.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.690
This square pulse is going to
be something which is really

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:33.070
wide after some period of time.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:37.820
So that's clearly a problem,
and how do we actually

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.650
solve this problem, and how do
we actually send information

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:45.620
like, for example, music
over a large distance

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:47.660
from one place to another place.

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.610
So that's essentially
what we're going

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:53.360
to try to understand today.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.150
So let's start with an
infinitely long string.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.780
And this string is actually very
long, and this began from here,

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:10.220
and it goes to some place which
is really, really far away.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.920
And, of course, as
usually, I can actually

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.580
hold one end of this
string and shake it a bit,

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.420
then I can actually
create some kind of pulse

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.420
which is going to
travel along this string

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:28.340
towards a positive x direction.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:31.150
In this case, I defined
the x coordinate

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.360
will be pointing to a
right hand side, and thus

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.450
the positive direction.

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:38.690
So of course I can hold this
string, and I just shake it,

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:43.700
and I would prepare a pulse
on this medium, which is

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:46.520
a string with constant tension.

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.750
So I can describe the motion--

00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:55.060
you can describe the motion of
Yen-Jie's hand by a function.

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:00.210
So you can say, OK, Yen-Jie is
somehow doing a really nice job

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:05.510
and oscillating at
constant frequency.

00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.620
Like I can say, OK, Yen-Jie
is shaking this thing

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:12.120
to produce a harmonic
wave, for example.

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.890
And that, I can actually
describe the motion of the hand

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.440
by f of t.

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.400
That's very good.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.690
And from what we have
learned in the last lecture,

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:27.725
we've found that,
basically, waves,

00:09:27.725 --> 00:09:31.850
harmonic waves with
different frequency,

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:33.670
or with different
wavelengths, are

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.950
traveling at different speeds.

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:43.420
Therefore, we would like to
actually decompose the motion

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:47.780
of Yen-Jie's hand into
many, many harmonic waves--

00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:51.740
then attack them one by one,
to follow them one by one,

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.020
then I can solve this problem.

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.540
So that's actually what
we are going to do.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:10:01.400
And that will involve some
math, which we would follow

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.830
from the math department.

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:07.430
And before that, I would like to
introduce the imitation first.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:10.970
As I said f of t is
actually the displacement

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.540
as a function of time
as x is equal to 0.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.504
So basically, I'm
holding this string,

00:10:16.504 --> 00:10:19.820
and I move things up and
down, so that, actually, I

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:23.490
move this string away from the
equilibrium positive, which

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:27.230
is actually y equal to 0.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.690
Then what is going to happen?

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.230
What is going to
happen is that I'm

00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:35.270
going to produce
some kind of pulse,

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.030
and this pulse, I can
actually describe it

00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:42.470
by a function, which
is psi x and p,

00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:46.460
this psi is actually
describing the displacement

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:50.030
as a function of x,
and as a function of t.

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:52.940
Apparently, if you
put x equals to zero,

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.220
then you go back
to f of t, right?

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:58.640
Basically that's the idea.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.410
OK.

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:06.770
So what we have learned
before we introduce

00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:20.890
dispersive medium is that, if
I have a non-dispersive medium,

00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:24.080
OK, if I have a
non-dispersive medium,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.300
then things are pretty
simple because omega over K

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:33.870
is actually a constant, which
is the phase velocity, vp.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:39.355
And omega is actually
just equal to vp times k.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:46.390
That means, no matter
what kind of wavelength

00:11:46.390 --> 00:11:49.600
we are talking about, no matter
what kind of angular frequency

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:55.030
we are talking about,
harmonic progressing wave

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.900
is going to travel
at the speed of Vp.

00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.590
No matter what's the frequency,
or what's the wavelength.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.140
So that makes our
life much simpler

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.870
when we work on
non-dispersive medium.

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:11.820
In this case, if I have
a non-dispersive medium,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:15.670
then psi would be equal to--

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.730
maybe I write it here--

00:12:18.730 --> 00:12:21.670
if I have non-dispersive
medium where,

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:25.090
no matter what
kind of frequency,

00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.690
the speed of the
harmonic traveling wave

00:12:27.690 --> 00:12:31.210
is a constant, which is actually
Vp, I can write down psi

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:43.420
x t to could be equal to
f of t minus x over v.

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.640
Just remember f is
actually describing

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.240
how I shake one
end of the string,

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.850
and, basically you
can see that ha!

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:54.800
What is happening is
that my hand is actually

00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.380
generating the shape of the
pulse as a function of x,

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.650
as a function of
time, and it can

00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:08.410
be described by a really
simple formula here.

00:13:08.410 --> 00:13:11.680
So this is actually really
nice for non-dispersive.

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:17.050
As I introduced before, when we
talk about dispersive medium,

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:27.970
then, if I go to
dispersive, omega

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:34.840
is actually a function of k, and
can be a non-linear function.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.060
So what does that mean?

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.020
That means, if I evaluate
vp, which is actually

00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.100
the phase velocity, which
is the formula there,

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:51.800
this is going to be
omega of k divided by k.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.010
That means BP is going
to be a function of k,

00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.220
the wavelength-- wave number.

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:02.390
It's not going to be a
constant in general--

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:07.680
unless omega is actually
equal to vp times k,

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:13.300
in general, vp can
actually be some quantity

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.900
which is variating
as a function of k.

00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:16.540
OK?

00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.770
Then we have trouble
because that means,

00:14:20.770 --> 00:14:24.880
when I produce progressing wave
from the left hand side end,

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:29.560
it's actually made of
many, many harmonic waves,

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.410
right, with different
angular frequency.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:37.240
So I can shake this like
[MAKES NOISE],, different speed.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:41.740
And I can always decompose
the motion of Yen-Jie's hand

00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.230
into many, many harmonic waves.

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:49.150
The problem is, all those
harmonic waves are going to be

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:52.690
travelling at different speed.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:56.190
How do we actually
describe this?

00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:58.110
So that's the trouble.

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:02.647
And I was really frustrated
when I think about this problem,

00:15:02.647 --> 00:15:04.230
and my friend from
the math department

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.440
said, hey, we have solved
this problem a long time ago.

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.820
So this is not the
problem anymore.

00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:16.360
And I say, oh, what is the
idea you're talking about?

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.600
And they actually
told me that you

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.960
should use Fourier transform
to attack this problem.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:23.990
OK?

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:25.840
This is the idea.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.180
The idea is that I
can now write down

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:35.610
f of t, which is motion
of Yen-Jie's hand,

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:41.550
and this can even returned
as a superposition

00:15:41.550 --> 00:15:46.890
of infinite number of waves.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:49.350
I can integrate
from minus infinity

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:55.270
to infinity, t omega, which
is the angular frequency.

00:15:55.270 --> 00:16:03.450
And each contributing wave
has an amplitutde associated

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:08.340
with it, which is, as you
see, is a function omega.

00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:11.900
And the actual wave is
actually written in terms

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:16.900
of exponential minus i omega t.

00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:21.750
So now, let's actually you look
at this thing really carefully.

00:16:21.750 --> 00:16:23.340
What am I doing?

00:16:23.340 --> 00:16:29.670
I am saying that I, now, can
shake one end of the string up

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:33.950
and down according to my will.

00:16:33.950 --> 00:16:36.840
And, if I do this
for a long time,

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:41.640
I can actually describe
the motion of my hand

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:47.070
by infinite number of harmonic
waves, which is actually

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:50.160
kind of like
exponential i omega t

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.380
describing the frequency of
these waves, and each of them

00:16:55.380 --> 00:17:00.020
got associated amplitude.

00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:02.230
And you may ask,
OK, wait a second,

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:07.240
you call this Fourier transform,
and I have learned that before,

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.060
but I learned a
different version.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.450
I learned a version
of cosine and sine?

00:17:12.450 --> 00:17:15.329
And what is going on?

00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:17.336
Actually, they are all the same.

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.960
No matter what you
do, you can actually

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.780
also do that with
cosine and sine,

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:25.710
but what I actually found
is that it's actually easier

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:29.610
to deal with exponential
functional form

00:17:29.610 --> 00:17:33.720
You can always write
exponential i omega

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:40.470
t in terms of sine and
cosine and absorb the i

00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:42.890
into a c omega.

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:45.520
Basically, these things are
identical between these two

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.130
forms of this answer.

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:49.350
So therefore, in
this lecture, I'm

00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.790
going to stick with
this functional form.

00:17:52.790 --> 00:17:54.232
OK, any questions?

00:17:54.232 --> 00:17:59.900
STUDENT: We don't include
dx in the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:01.000
YEN-JIE LEE: Not yet.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.590
We are going to include that.

00:18:02.590 --> 00:18:07.590
Because, for that, in
order to actually--

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:11.250
OK, so now I actually
decompose the motion of my hand

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:14.020
into many, many waves--

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.020
which should be or is say
it many, many oscillation

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:19.860
with different frequencies.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.590
So I actually
describe the motion

00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:26.500
of my hand infinite
number of oscillation

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.300
with different frequency.

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:34.900
And the trouble we are facing is
that all those oscillations are

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:37.960
going to be charged
travelling at different speeds

00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:42.160
because of the
dispersion relation.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.760
Therefore, what I am
going to do afterwards

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:50.170
is to show you that, OK, I can
write down the functional form

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:54.130
for psi in this general case.

00:18:54.130 --> 00:18:58.100
So for that, that's actually
what I'm going to do now.

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.730
So now, I would like to know
what would be the psi xt, which

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:06.970
actually the position of the
string as a function of x,

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:11.020
and at some specific
time equal to t.

00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:16.690
And that can be written as, I
do the an integration from minus

00:19:16.690 --> 00:19:23.380
infinity to infinity
over frequency omega,

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:27.310
and I have the usual
amplitude associated

00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:29.770
with the angular
frequency omega,

00:19:29.770 --> 00:19:35.810
and the exponential i omega t--

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:38.890
minus i omega t because that's
the convention I'm using here--

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:46.020
and I say, OK, plus ik,
which is a function omega--

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:46.960
x.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.510
So now you can to
see that what I'm

00:19:49.510 --> 00:19:53.250
doing here is that I
am now progressing,

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.680
I am making infinite number
of progressing waves.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.320
Each of these
exponential functions

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.630
is a progressing wave with
angular frequency omega.

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:10.110
And why do I write k as a
function of omega x here?

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.572
It's because they are going
to be travelling at the speed

00:20:12.572 --> 00:20:15.160
of omega over k.

00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:19.630
Therefore, I need to
actually put k here,

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.660
and this k is actually--

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:27.040
this k is actually not
the independent parameter.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.800
It's actually a
function of omega.

00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:33.730
So we can see that, here, we
do an integration over omega

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.960
from minus infinity
to infinity--

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:42.040
for each omega you can actually
find the corresponding k,

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:42.760
right?

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.370
Because of the
dispersion relation.

00:20:45.370 --> 00:20:47.770
Because omega is
a function of k,

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.420
therefore you can always solve
the corresponding k, right?

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.130
Then you put it there?

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.610
Because you are now
trying to propagate

00:20:58.610 --> 00:21:01.660
how many waves with
different angular

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:04.130
frequency at different speed--

00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:05.307
then we are done.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.690
That looks like a
wonderful solution,

00:21:10.690 --> 00:21:17.150
and we can actually see how
it works for our purpose.

00:21:17.150 --> 00:21:18.310
Any questions?

00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:21.850
All right.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.090
So that's really nice.

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:26.650
And I can now do a
really simple test

00:21:26.650 --> 00:21:29.640
to see if this really works.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:32.790
Let me try a very simple case.

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.358
OK, a spatial case.

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:41.970
If I now go back to
use this description

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:46.080
to describe non-dispersive
medium and see what

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.340
will happen.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:52.210
Now my k as a function omega
is actually rather simple.

00:21:52.210 --> 00:21:53.740
It's actually omega over vp--

00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.760
according to the
dispersion relation here.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.820
I can solve k, as
I was mentioning,

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.610
with these dispersion
relation formula.

00:22:08.610 --> 00:22:11.250
And then I can conclude
k as a function

00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:15.920
omega is omega over vp.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:18.680
Then I can now put that
into this equation,

00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.380
and I'm going to
get psi x of t--

00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.930
this would be equal
to minus infinity

00:22:24.930 --> 00:22:33.270
to infinity d omega, c omega,
exponential minus i omega

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:37.140
t minus omega over vx.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:47.160
And we can actually take omega
out of this, minus infinity

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:54.060
to infinity d omega c omega
exponential minus i omega

00:22:54.060 --> 00:23:02.850
t minus x divided by v. And
you can see that, huh, indeed,

00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:09.990
this is actually ft
minus x over v. OK.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.670
I'm dropping the vp here.

00:23:11.670 --> 00:23:16.030
This should be vp
all over the place.

00:23:16.030 --> 00:23:21.450
So you can see that, now, if I
have solved the k as a function

00:23:21.450 --> 00:23:25.380
omega, and I plug it in
in this special case,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:31.590
which is non-dispersive medium,
omega over k equal to vp,

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:36.310
then I really calculate
this integral,

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:38.450
then I can quickly
identify that--

00:23:38.450 --> 00:23:43.750
huh, I can write the
functional form in this way.

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:48.300
And this is actually
really familiar to me

00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:52.580
because that's actually using
this definition, f is actually

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.550
equal to integration minus
infinity to infinity, d omega,

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:59.670
c omega, exponential
minus i omega t.

00:23:59.670 --> 00:24:06.280
If I replace t, by t minus
x over vp, then I'm done.

00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:10.500
So I have evaluated this
integration, which is actually

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.670
just f t minus x over vp.

00:24:14.670 --> 00:24:19.740
So that's exactly what
guessed from the beginning.

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:22.170
So if I have a
non-dispersive medium,

00:24:22.170 --> 00:24:26.490
then psi xt will be
equal to this function.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.440
So that gives us some
kind of confidence that,

00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:33.600
OK, at the easy case, it works.

00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:39.510
All right, so that's very
nice, all sounds very good.

00:24:39.510 --> 00:24:41.190
But wait a second.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:43.470
How do I actually
extract this c,

00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:45.690
which is a function of omega?

00:24:45.690 --> 00:24:50.580
I'm troubled because this
is an infinite integral from

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:52.480
minus infinity to infinity.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:55.560
And that means I have infinite
number of constants, which I

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.830
have to determine the c omega.

00:24:58.830 --> 00:24:59.970
How do I actually do this?

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.180
So that is another
point which I would

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:09.180
like to discuss before
we actually go ahead

00:25:09.180 --> 00:25:15.360
and really use this function
for the dispersive medium case.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.680
So how to we actually extract
c as a function of omega?

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:27.630
So for that, we really
need to employ a few uses

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:31.860
for formula, which are
actually documented here.

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:36.030
How many of you actually have
not heard about delta function

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:37.520
before?

00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.560
OK, a few of you actually have
not heard about delta function.

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:44.730
So what is actually
your delta function?

00:25:44.730 --> 00:25:47.910
This is a delta function.

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:52.155
So a delta function
is actually a notation

00:25:52.155 --> 00:25:58.280
which actually shows
you a function, which

00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:03.180
is should only be non-zero,
at x equal to zero.

00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:07.200
And the x equal to zero,
the size of this function

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:11.290
as you're going to infinity,
and on the other hand,

00:26:11.290 --> 00:26:16.520
all the other points
at x not equal to zero,

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.980
the delta function
is equal to zero.

00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:23.820
So that's actually the kind of
function I was talking about.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:28.010
And the area of this function,
if you're doing the equation

00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:32.040
over minus infinity
infinity over x,

00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:38.220
the integration of these delta
m the area is actually 1.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.420
So that is actually
the kind of function.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:45.870
So essentially, it's a really,
really narrow function, OK,

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:50.040
very narrow, very
narrow, very narrow.

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.870
But the area is
finite, which is why.

00:26:54.870 --> 00:26:57.870
So you can have a square.

00:26:57.870 --> 00:27:01.320
You can actually start
with a square pulse,

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.390
or square function,
and you can actually

00:27:03.390 --> 00:27:07.670
make the width of the square
narrower, smaller and smaller

00:27:07.670 --> 00:27:09.610
and smaller, go to 0.

00:27:09.610 --> 00:27:11.680
Then what you are going
to get is essentially

00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.620
the delta function.

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:18.990
That's actually how we
understand this delta function.

00:27:18.990 --> 00:27:20.900
All right, really quickly.

00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:24.930
And also, we would like
to use a few formula which

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:26.800
are documented here.

00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:32.040
So if I do an integration from
minus infinity to infinity,

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.490
exponential i omega
minus omega prime,

00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:40.830
t over the t which is
integrating over time, t, here.

00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:45.770
And then divide the whole
formula by 1 and over 2pi.

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.030
What I'm going to get
is a delta function,

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:53.670
which is a delta function which
is omega minus omega prime.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:58.590
So that means when this delta
function formula tells us

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:02.610
that omega is equal
to omega prime,

00:28:02.610 --> 00:28:06.900
then this function is
actually going to infinity.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.620
And only when omega
equal to omega prime,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.700
this function is not zero.

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:16.750
Any other place, this
function is always zero.

00:28:19.290 --> 00:28:22.230
And this strange
integration should give you

00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:23.530
this delta function.

00:28:23.530 --> 00:28:26.140
So that's the first
thing which we will use,

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.350
was one useful formula.

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:32.130
The second thing which
what just I talked about,

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:35.560
if I do an integration over
minus infinity to infinity,

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:40.410
delta x dx, then
basically you get 1.

00:28:40.410 --> 00:28:43.290
The third one is actually
kind of interesting.

00:28:43.290 --> 00:28:44.400
Let's take a look.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.510
So if I do an integration
over from minus infinity

00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:54.630
to infinity, delta
function x minus alpha.

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.060
Let's look at this
delta function first.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:04.596
This function is only non-zero
when x is equal to what?

00:29:04.596 --> 00:29:05.262
AUDIENCE: Alpha.

00:29:05.262 --> 00:29:06.012
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah.

00:29:06.012 --> 00:29:10.310
When x is equal to alpha,
only when that happen,

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:12.410
this is actually non-zero.

00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:18.050
If you multiply this delta
function to some function which

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:22.610
is f of alpha, and integrate
over alpha from minus

00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:25.040
infinity to infinity.

00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.620
And that means
that when alpha is

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:32.000
equal to x, or x equal to
alpha, this integration

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.750
give you non-zero result.
All the other ways,

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.420
you will get zero.

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:41.470
The interesting thing is that
if you do this integration, what

00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:47.316
you are going to get is that
OK, when I integrate over alpha,

00:29:47.316 --> 00:29:51.260
only when alpha is equal to
x this thing is non-zero.

00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:52.730
Therefore what you
are going to get

00:29:52.730 --> 00:29:56.780
is, you get only one point of
the width, which is actually

00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:59.180
f of x.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:02.282
So that's the intuition
about this formula.

00:30:02.282 --> 00:30:02.990
That's just fine.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.731
Any questions related
to those formulas?

00:30:05.731 --> 00:30:08.677
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:08.677 --> 00:30:10.150
YEN-JIE LEE: Hm?

00:30:10.150 --> 00:30:11.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:30:13.599 --> 00:30:15.890
YEN-JIE LEE: Yeah, this is
actually pretty complicated,

00:30:15.890 --> 00:30:21.300
so it would take a few 10,
20 minutes to explain that.

00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:23.790
But let's just take the words
from the math department--

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:24.802
we trust them.

00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.040
All right, so once I
have those formula,

00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:35.610
I can now demonstrate
you how I can actually

00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:38.750
track C as a function omega.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:41.320
So this is actually
the goal, right?

00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:43.480
So don't forget why we are
doing what we are doing,

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:47.810
is to try to extract what
is actually the C omega,

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:54.410
so that we can actually
finish this formula.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:56.450
So how do we do that?

00:30:56.450 --> 00:31:00.170
So suppose, if I evaluate this.

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:12.910
This function, 1 over
2pi, minus infinity

00:31:12.910 --> 00:31:23.610
to infinity dt, ft,
exponential i omega t.

00:31:23.610 --> 00:31:26.480
If I evaluate this function.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.860
This is coming out
of nowhere, right?

00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:34.090
So coming out of Yen-Jie's
hand, maybe, I don't know.

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:38.490
Suppose if I evaluate
this function,

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:40.980
and now I have ft here, right?

00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:47.790
I can replace ft by these
interesting formula.

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:54.360
If I do that, then basically I
get 1 over 2pi minus infinity

00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:04.010
to infinity dt, minus
infinity infinity C omega

00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:10.600
prime, exponential
minus i omega prime t.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.330
And the last is actually
integrating over d omega prime.

00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.480
So this is actually the f of t.

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:24.490
This is actually f of t.

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.380
I'm just replacing that
formula into this integral.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:33.140
And then I have the rest,
which is exponential i omega t.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:39.660
And of course, I can
continue and collect

00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:42.810
all the relevant terms together.

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:51.930
This is actually equal to 1 over
2i, minus infinity to infinity.

00:32:51.930 --> 00:32:57.510
I collect all the terms related
to omega prime to the left hand

00:32:57.510 --> 00:32:58.690
side.

00:32:58.690 --> 00:33:04.940
Basically what I get is C
omega prime d omega prime.

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:10.920
This is actually coming
from here, except--

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.420
yeah, OK, it is actually
coming from here.

00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:20.830
And I have another integral
which is from minus infinity

00:33:20.830 --> 00:33:26.770
to infinity, this time
integrating over delta dt.

00:33:26.770 --> 00:33:36.480
And I have dt here, exponential
i omega minus omega prime t.

00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:44.650
So basically I'm collecting
these two terms together.

00:33:44.650 --> 00:33:48.660
They now become exponential
i omega minus omega prime t.

00:33:51.390 --> 00:33:55.980
So basically, no magic happened,
but I'm just re-writing things

00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:01.680
and we are arranging things from
this formula to that formula.

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:08.130
Then if we look at this
formula, this formula here,

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:10.889
and the formula sheet we have.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:14.840
1 over 2pi minus
infinity to infinity

00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.920
to this integration over
t, exponential i omega

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.940
minus omega prime t.

00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.510
That will give you
delta function,

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:25.130
which is delta omega
minus omega prime.

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:31.750
Therefore, I can continue
this calculation here.

00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:45.800
Thus it's going to give you
minus infinity to infinity.

00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:53.870
I identify this part,
this part, and this part,

00:34:53.870 --> 00:34:55.440
to be the delta function.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:03.340
Therefore, what I get is
minus infinity to infinity, C

00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:14.850
omega prime, delta omega minus
omega prime, d omega prime.

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:17.450
Am I going too fast?

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:20.637
Everybody's following?

00:35:20.637 --> 00:35:22.470
So you can see that
what we have been doing,

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:26.490
I use this formula
coming out of nowhere.

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:31.980
I replace f by the formula
I was writing there.

00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:34.920
And then I collect the
terms I like together.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.910
That's all I did.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:38.790
And then I found, aha!

00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:44.240
One part of the formula is
actually the delta function.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.420
Then I put the delta
a function here.

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:50.200
And then finally, I use
the third formula here,

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:54.230
which I have related to delta
function, and I found, aha!

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:56.250
If I do this
integration, I know how

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.740
to do this integration
even without knowing

00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:02.610
the structure of C. This
is actually just changing

00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:06.320
the omega prime to omega.

00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:10.650
So that's actually what this
integration actually does.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:16.500
Therefore, I get C omega.

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:20.190
Look at what we have done.

00:36:20.190 --> 00:36:23.350
What we have done is
that, we have proof

00:36:23.350 --> 00:36:27.240
that this formula
coming out of nowhere,

00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:32.080
to be a continuous
version of mode picker.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.130
You remember the fourth
year decomposition before?

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:39.840
You were using the orthogonality
of the sine function,

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.840
and I can do some kind
of fancy integration

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.700
to actually extract
a m from one of the--

00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.440
which is associated with one
of the normal mode, right?

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:53.460
What we are doing here is
actually a continuous version.

00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.740
Now omega is
actually continuous.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:37:02.220
And I'm now using
the orthogonality

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:05.220
of the exponential function.

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.130
If I do this integration,
that will only

00:37:08.130 --> 00:37:14.020
give you non-zero value when
omega is equal to omega prime.

00:37:14.020 --> 00:37:16.210
It's exactly the
same thing, right?

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:21.220
Then I can construct an
integration like this.

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:24.360
And now will give
you the redoubting C

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:29.142
as a function omega, which
is like the amplitude of one

00:37:29.142 --> 00:37:34.470
of the associated harmonics
exponential i omega t.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.240
So in short, from
this exercise, we

00:37:37.240 --> 00:37:40.330
have shown you
that C of omega can

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:46.360
be extracted using this formula
1 over 2pi, minus infinity

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:54.790
to infinity dt, f of t,
exponential i omega t.

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:58.660
That's actually how we
actually can determine

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:06.100
all the amplitude associated
to a specific exponential

00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.000
function.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.040
Any questions so far?

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:17.760
OK, so if no question, then
we can actually continue.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:22.040
So let's actually go back
to the original question,

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:24.710
which we were posting.

00:38:24.710 --> 00:38:29.540
So we have a problem
related to the transmission

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.830
of information.

00:38:31.830 --> 00:38:35.570
So this is actually
where we got started.

00:38:35.570 --> 00:38:42.320
If I send a square pulse
on a dispersive median,

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.170
then I have some
trouble, which is

00:38:45.170 --> 00:38:49.190
that this pulse is going
to disperse and become

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:50.700
wider and wider.

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:53.000
It's changing as a
function of time,

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.280
as a function of
distance it travel.

00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.680
That's not cool.

00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:03.130
All right, so therefore what
I am going to do is this.

00:39:03.130 --> 00:39:06.330
There was a very
smart idea which

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:10.970
were discovered long time
ago, during maybe World War I,

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:17.665
and widely used in World War
II, which is the AM radio.

00:39:17.665 --> 00:39:18.640
What is AM?

00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:25.120
Is actually amplitude
modulation radio.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.850
This smart idea
is the following.

00:39:28.850 --> 00:39:32.840
I will describe it
before we take a break.

00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:41.840
So this smart idea, AM
radio is the following.

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:47.270
If I have some kind of
information which is fs t.

00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:50.180
s here means signal.

00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:51.890
If I have some
kind of information

00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:53.870
I would like to
send, I can send it

00:39:53.870 --> 00:39:59.300
by oscillating one
end of the string.

00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.200
And this is what I want to send.

00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.430
And there are two ways you
can send this fs function.

00:40:08.430 --> 00:40:14.050
The first one is actually what
did before, I send it directly.

00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:16.940
I just said OK, if I want
to send this function,

00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:19.850
then I just oscillate
the string according

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.180
to the functional form.

00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:25.130
Yen-Jie just have to be
really careful, right?

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:27.650
So that you can
send this function.

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:31.680
And that fails miserably.

00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.720
Why?

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:38.580
Because all the components
which actually produce the fs,

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:43.690
in this case the square pulse,
all those components are

00:40:43.690 --> 00:40:46.200
travelling at different speed.

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.020
Therefore, the information
will never get there,

00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:53.460
because of the dispersion.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.840
So now what should
we do instead?

00:40:56.840 --> 00:41:02.440
Instead of doing sending fs
as a function of t directly,

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.040
what you could do
is that I can now

00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:15.940
send f of t, which is equal
to f of s t cosine omega0t.

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:26.610
Where omega0 is a very,
very large number.

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:29.310
And basically, look at
what we have been doing.

00:41:29.310 --> 00:41:34.350
So that means I, instead
of sending fs directly,

00:41:34.350 --> 00:41:39.960
I send fs, but modulated
by a really high frequency

00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.410
function, cosine omega0t.

00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:45.690
And this will work.

00:41:45.690 --> 00:41:48.480
And you will only know
that after we come back

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:53.040
from the break, which
is twenty first.

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.900
Let's take five minute break.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:58.380
And if you have any questions,
you can actually ask me here.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:12.750
So we will continue the
discussion about AM radio.

00:42:12.750 --> 00:42:16.890
So before the break, actually
we introduced this one

00:42:16.890 --> 00:42:23.220
possible solution to solve
this dispersive median problem,

00:42:23.220 --> 00:42:29.450
is that I can now actually send
instead of fs as a function

00:42:29.450 --> 00:42:33.200
t, which is actually the
signal I want to send,

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:38.460
I could send fs, but
multiplied by cosine omega0t.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:48.660
If I assume that fs is
some really slow function,

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:52.290
slowly varying as
a function of time,

00:42:52.290 --> 00:42:55.870
compared to cosine omega0t.

00:42:55.870 --> 00:43:00.600
Cosine omega0t is a
really fast function,

00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:03.930
oscillating up and down
like crazy, really fast.

00:43:03.930 --> 00:43:08.190
If I multiply fs
by this function,

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:10.490
what is going to happen?

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:13.030
We are going to show
you that actually that

00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:19.410
means I am going to
only have non-zero C

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:23.150
function, or a large
contribution of C,

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:25.610
in a very thin middle
range of omega.

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.470
So we'll show that.

00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:35.700
So in a typical case, fs is
really slow, which is like,

00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.620
for example, my
sound, et cetera,

00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:41.460
in the label of one kilohertz.

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:43.710
And you can actually
design a system

00:43:43.710 --> 00:43:51.570
which will actually multiply
this fs by cosine omega0t.

00:43:51.570 --> 00:43:57.960
Omega0 can be as fast
as 1.1 to 30 megahertz.

00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:01.470
If you do this
calculation, then you

00:44:01.470 --> 00:44:20.210
will find that OK, the range
of omega, with sizable C omega

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.500
is small.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:34.550
It's roughly equal to
omega0 minus omega s,

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:41.470
to omega0 plus omega
s, where omega s is

00:44:41.470 --> 00:44:47.780
the typical frequency
in your signal.

00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:52.210
And the omega0 is the
typical frequency of--

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:55.820
the frequency of
your cosine omega t

00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:58.120
term, which is
actually, later, you

00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.765
will recognize this as carrier.

00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:07.080
So what I want to say is
that if I do this trick,

00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:08.870
what is going to happen
is that the range

00:45:08.870 --> 00:45:14.450
of omega, which you have sizable
contribution from C omega--

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:17.670
C omega is the
associated amplitude,

00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:20.090
associated amplitude.

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:23.450
It's going to be confined
to a really small region

00:45:23.450 --> 00:45:28.590
from omega0 minus omega
s, to omega0 plus omega s.

00:45:28.590 --> 00:45:33.670
So that's the trick which
actually makes this problem

00:45:33.670 --> 00:45:34.170
solvable.

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:40.940
How do we know this?

00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.760
That is because, if
I now, for example, I

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:51.610
send fs equal to
cosine omega st.

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.710
If this is actually the signal
which I would like to send,

00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:58.430
just a harmonic wave, then
what is going to happen

00:45:58.430 --> 00:46:07.730
is that I'm going to get ft
is equal to cosine omega st

00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:09.390
cosine--

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:13.520
so this is actually
multiplied by cosine omega0t.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:17.960
So I have cosine omega0t here.

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.800
I have cosine
multiplied by cosine.

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:24.620
Therefore I have
the question which

00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:28.360
I prepare here, the formula,
of cosine alpha times

00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:32.540
cosine beta will be equal
to the functional form.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:35.240
There's a remainder,
therefore I can now

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:42.130
write it as 1 over
2 cosine omega s

00:46:42.130 --> 00:46:53.770
minus omega0 t plus cosine
omega s plus omega0.

00:46:57.540 --> 00:47:03.640
You can see that when I actually
multiply two cosine functions

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:10.480
together, then what I get is
actually the omega0 minus omega

00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:11.580
s.

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:15.420
You can actually put the minus
sign there, it didn't matter.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:21.930
And cosine omega0
plus omega s times t.

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:24.660
So therefore, you can see that
the frequency, there are only

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:29.250
two frequencies which contribute
to this C of omega, which is

00:47:29.250 --> 00:47:31.500
actually these two frequencies.

00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:36.280
So that is actually why,
if you do this trick,

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:41.100
you actually try to modulate
your slow signal function

00:47:41.100 --> 00:47:45.000
by a fast carrier frequency.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.950
Then you are going to confine
the effective range of omega

00:47:49.950 --> 00:47:53.460
into a very small range.

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:56.660
Why is that useful?

00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:00.240
That's actually what I
want to answer to you.

00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:06.060
Suppose I have this crazy
dispersion relation, which

00:48:06.060 --> 00:48:10.940
is omega as a function
of K. You can graph it,

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.350
and suppose it looks
really crazy like this.

00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:26.010
And if I set my carrier
oscillation frequency

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:35.130
to be omega0, and that will
give you a corresponding wave

00:48:35.130 --> 00:48:39.240
number which is K0.

00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.290
I hope you can see it.

00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:47.130
That's the corresponding K0.

00:48:47.130 --> 00:48:54.990
Before we actually multiply this
function, it's a slow function.

00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:57.220
It's not exactly
one cosine function.

00:48:57.220 --> 00:49:00.270
So if you just have a cosine
function harmonic wave,

00:49:00.270 --> 00:49:02.086
then you don't really
need this trick,

00:49:02.086 --> 00:49:03.460
because it's
actually going to be

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:07.620
traveling at a speed
of some constant speed.

00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.690
It's a harmonic traveling wave.

00:49:09.690 --> 00:49:14.100
But if this is actually
a slow function, but not

00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:18.780
really a single harmonic wave,
then what is going to happen

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:23.700
is that you are going to need a
wide range of K value or omega

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:28.470
value to describe fs.

00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:31.360
Then you are in
trouble because now,

00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:35.260
all the waves with different
wavelengths are going to be

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:37.290
travelling at different speed.

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:40.900
Then you have this
dispersion problem.

00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:44.460
On the other hand, if I
multiply this function,

00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:48.940
this slow function, by a
fast oscillating function,

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:55.420
I am confining the
effective range of omega

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:58.690
into this small box,
which is actually

00:49:58.690 --> 00:50:06.100
between omega0 minus
or plus omega s.

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:09.870
This is actually omega0
plus minus omega s.

00:50:09.870 --> 00:50:13.830
This is actually the range
of the possible omega,

00:50:13.830 --> 00:50:17.650
which contribute to
this resulting f of t.

00:50:17.650 --> 00:50:21.870
Therefore, the behavior
of this function

00:50:21.870 --> 00:50:26.470
is actually much
easier to understand.

00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:33.370
So with that given
there, suppose now I have

00:50:33.370 --> 00:50:37.330
a large difference between--

00:50:37.330 --> 00:50:40.945
suppose I have a large
difference between omega s

00:50:40.945 --> 00:50:42.490
and omega0.

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:46.780
Then I can actually focus
on a very small range

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:53.530
in this dispersion
relation diagram.

00:50:53.530 --> 00:50:56.830
Then I can write omega
as a function of K,

00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:03.790
the dispersion relation
equal to omega0 plus K

00:51:03.790 --> 00:51:10.400
minus K0, partial omega,
partial K. Evaluate

00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:15.700
it at a equal to K0,
plus higher order term.

00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:20.470
Basically I can do
this Taylor expansion.

00:51:20.470 --> 00:51:26.640
And maybe it surprised you, you
can immediately identify, ha!

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:35.060
This is delta d omega dk,
is the group velocity.

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:39.210
Suddenly it show up in
the Taylor expansion

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:42.550
of the dispersion relation.

00:51:42.550 --> 00:51:48.760
so if I focus on the region
which is around omega0,

00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:53.750
then I can actually re-write
omega in this functional form.

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:59.500
Omega is actually
equal to omega0 plus K

00:51:59.500 --> 00:52:04.810
minus K0 times Vg, which
is the group velocity.

00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:14.570
Suppose this is happening,
then now I can actually

00:52:14.570 --> 00:52:23.540
go ahead and really calculate
the functional form for f of t.

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:29.200
So suppose I have
this definition of t.

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:41.330
The definition of t is equal
to fs t times cosine omega0t.

00:52:41.330 --> 00:52:45.230
Or say I can actually
write it in a complex form,

00:52:45.230 --> 00:52:51.230
instead of writing it in a
cosine omega0t functional form,

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:54.540
I can write it in
exponential functional form.

00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:59.750
Exponential minus i omega0t,
which is actually more

00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:04.130
convenient for the discussion.

00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:09.190
So what is going to happen if
I actually do this calculation?

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:12.080
Then basically that's
one example signal

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:14.990
which I would like to
send on the slides.

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:21.680
So if I am trying to send a
progressing harmonic wave,

00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:27.740
then after multiplying by
this exponential i omega0t

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:30.380
function, or a cosine
function, basically

00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:32.990
you get something which is
actually oscillating really

00:53:32.990 --> 00:53:37.100
fast, which is actually
the AM signal we are trying

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:41.030
to send through this media.

00:53:41.030 --> 00:53:43.640
So we can actually
identify, this

00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:47.300
is actually the structure of
this, actually the carrier.

00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:55.700
And this signal
become the analogue,

00:53:55.700 --> 00:54:00.630
in analogy to what we actually
have discussed for that beat

00:54:00.630 --> 00:54:01.710
phenomenon case.

00:54:04.650 --> 00:54:14.810
So now, if the omega
range is really small,

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:18.700
then I can actually
write this down.

00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:23.060
Write a functional form of
omega in this functional form.

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:29.090
Or I can actually
take out the kVg term,

00:54:29.090 --> 00:54:31.910
and the rest is actually
going to be something

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:39.650
like some constant a, where
a is actually equal to omega0

00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:43.220
minus Vg times K0.

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:47.960
So basically I'm just
taking out this K term here,

00:54:47.960 --> 00:54:51.620
and this become this term.

00:54:51.620 --> 00:54:54.290
With this formula,
I can solve what

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:58.350
would be the
functional form for K,

00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:01.860
as a preparation for what
I'm going to do later.

00:55:01.860 --> 00:55:08.330
So K can be also expressed
as omega over Vg.

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:12.910
So basically I just
solve the K plus b.

00:55:12.910 --> 00:55:16.030
b is actually just
some constant.

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:17.810
Just do it for
convenience, I can

00:55:17.810 --> 00:55:25.520
write b equal to K0 minus
omega0 divided by Vg.

00:55:25.520 --> 00:55:31.010
What we learned here is that
if the range of effective omega

00:55:31.010 --> 00:55:35.710
is really small
around omega zero,

00:55:35.710 --> 00:55:39.590
then the relation
between omega and the K

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:42.170
becomes a linear function.

00:55:42.170 --> 00:55:47.910
Of course, it's still not like
the case for the non dispersive

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:53.700
median, where omega
over K is a constant.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.922
But at least it becomes
a linear function,

00:55:56.922 --> 00:55:58.130
which is actually much nicer.

00:56:01.070 --> 00:56:05.780
So finally, with all those
preparation we have done,

00:56:05.780 --> 00:56:10.100
we would like to show one
important consequence.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:17.300
So what we are trying to
do is to show that psi xt.

00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:22.130
Now I send, I
oscillate the median,

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:27.450
the string, by this f of
t, which I designed there.

00:56:27.450 --> 00:56:33.930
ft is actually fs times
exponential i omega0t.

00:56:33.930 --> 00:56:37.460
That's actually designed there.

00:56:37.460 --> 00:56:41.810
I would like to show that
the resulting amplitude will

00:56:41.810 --> 00:56:56.130
be equal to fs t minus x divided
by Vg, exponential minus i

00:56:56.130 --> 00:57:00.460
omega0t minus K0x.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:03.636
Of course I need to take
the real part of this

00:57:03.636 --> 00:57:07.730
in, to go back to the real axis.

00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:14.990
Basically I dropped the i
sine omega t contribution.

00:57:14.990 --> 00:57:18.500
So this is actually
what I want to show.

00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:21.540
Before I go through
all those math,

00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:25.070
let's do get the conclusion
which we would like to draw,

00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:28.120
before we actually really
go through the math.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.730
The conclusion which I would
like to draw is that, OK,

00:57:31.730 --> 00:57:35.540
this is actually my analogue.

00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:41.480
My analogue is going to be
travelling at the speed of Vg,

00:57:41.480 --> 00:57:43.504
which is the group velocity.

00:57:43.504 --> 00:57:45.170
That's the conclusion
which I would like

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:47.660
to draw from this exercise.

00:57:47.660 --> 00:57:54.350
And this thing is actually
cosine omega0t minus K0x.

00:57:54.350 --> 00:57:57.830
Therefore, this is
actually a harmonic wave.

00:57:57.830 --> 00:58:02.540
The carrier is a harmonic
wave travelling at Vp equal

00:58:02.540 --> 00:58:06.590
to omega0 divided by K0.

00:58:06.590 --> 00:58:08.660
That's the kind of
conclusion which I would like

00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:13.050
to draw from this exercise.

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:18.110
Any questions about what
we have discussed so far?

00:58:18.110 --> 00:58:23.750
OK, then really you have to
hold tight and follow me really,

00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:26.350
100% focus, because
this is actually

00:58:26.350 --> 00:58:29.010
a complicated calculation.

00:58:29.010 --> 00:58:35.150
So now what I can do is, now I
need to express my fs in terms

00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:41.360
of C. So I do integration
from minus infinity

00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:50.150
to infinity, d omega, C omega,
exponential minus i omega t.

00:58:50.150 --> 00:58:53.870
So basically I can
write my f of s

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:59.690
in a functional form,
which we introduced before.

00:58:59.690 --> 00:59:07.640
Then my f function is actually
equal to fs times exponential i

00:59:07.640 --> 00:59:10.910
omega minus i omega0t.

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:14.480
So that's actually
what we defined there.

00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:19.270
And this would be equal to
minus infinity to infinity.

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:27.090
I do this integration number,
omega C omega exponential minus

00:59:27.090 --> 00:59:33.800
i omega plus omega0 times t.

00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:38.200
So there's nothing special, I
just take my expression for fs,

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:42.877
multiply that by
exponential minus i omega0t.

00:59:42.877 --> 00:59:44.210
Then that's actually what I get.

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:58.320
So since this is actually
integration over omega

00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:02.700
from minus infinity to
infinity, therefore I

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:07.410
can always have the freedom
to shift the origin.

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:15.600
So that means f of t can be
returned as minus infinity

01:00:15.600 --> 01:00:24.210
to infinity d omega C omega
minus omega0 exponential minus

01:00:24.210 --> 01:00:27.440
i omega t.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.950
Then we can see that is
fix a relation between C

01:00:31.950 --> 01:00:38.760
of the f function, and
the C of the fs function.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:41.420
So so far, everything is exact.

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:46.110
I haven't made any
approximation so far.

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:54.660
So now, I can take this function
and propagate that to all x.

01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:58.800
In other words, I
can now take this ft,

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:03.570
and write down the psi
as a function of x and t.

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:06.690
So that means all the
different components are

01:01:06.690 --> 01:01:10.860
traveling at different speeds.

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.570
So basically, I
can write it down

01:01:12.570 --> 01:01:20.160
like d omega C omega minus
omega0, exponential minus i

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.170
omega t, exponential ikx.

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:28.650
Kx k is actually a
function of omega.

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.410
Any questions?

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:35.550
So that's actually just
identical to what we actually

01:01:35.550 --> 01:01:36.900
have done before.

01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:45.250
So now I can go from f of t to
sine, if you are following me.

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:48.270
So until here, everything exact.

01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:50.890
You have all the
problems you have,

01:01:50.890 --> 01:01:53.240
like you know this
dispersion essentially,

01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.730
because all the
little components,

01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:59.820
as you can see here, can be
travelling at different speeds.

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.430
So now, what I could
do is that if I

01:02:04.430 --> 01:02:11.820
assume that C omega is only
sizable at the small range

01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:18.130
around, it's only
sizable around omega0.

01:02:18.130 --> 01:02:23.040
If now I take this
assumption and propagate

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.360
into this formula, then
I can write this psi

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.820
function roughly
like minus infinity

01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:40.780
to infinity d omega C omega
minus omega0 exponential minus

01:02:40.780 --> 01:02:45.880
i omega t exponential i.

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:50.800
Now I can take the
formula which I actually

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:56.040
did an approximation,
around omega0.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:03.450
Around omega0, K can be returned
us omega over Vg plus b.

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:05.910
This is actually where I
take the approximation.

01:03:05.910 --> 01:03:10.320
Only consider the first order
in the Taylor expansion.

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:13.650
So you can see now here,
it's not exact anymore.

01:03:13.650 --> 01:03:19.110
But now I write approximate
function of form for K omega.

01:03:19.110 --> 01:03:25.180
So what I'm going to
get is omega over Vg

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.170
plus b, multiplied by x.

01:03:32.980 --> 01:03:33.931
Any questions?

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:38.350
Now I have the approximation.

01:03:38.350 --> 01:03:42.760
And of course now I can gather
all the terms related to omega

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:44.530
together.

01:03:44.530 --> 01:03:47.650
I'm getting minus
infinity to infinity

01:03:47.650 --> 01:03:56.830
d omega C omega minus omega0
exponential minus i omega t

01:03:56.830 --> 01:04:05.560
minus x over Vg,
exponential ibx.

01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:09.550
So basically, I am merging
this term and that term.

01:04:09.550 --> 01:04:14.040
This term and that term
will give you this term.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:18.160
And what is essentially the
rest is the exponential ibx.

01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:22.750
We are almost there.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:32.570
So now I would like to use this
board, so I need to erase that.

01:04:41.050 --> 01:04:48.160
So now I continue from
here, and I can now again,

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:52.750
I can again change the origin
of this infinite integral

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:58.720
so that this can be
written as minus infinity

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:04.400
to infinity, d omega
C function of omega,

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:16.960
exponential minus i omega
plus omega0, t minus x divided

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:22.320
by Vg, and exponential ibx.

01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:29.320
So what I come from this
board to that formula,

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.260
if you are following
me we are almost there,

01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:34.900
because I am changing
the origin again,

01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:38.200
so that omega minus
omega0 becomes

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:40.510
omega, become a new omega.

01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:43.840
Is everybody
accepting this fact?

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:46.100
And that means
the original omega

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:52.360
will become omega plus omega0.

01:05:52.360 --> 01:05:58.120
I'm trying to go really slow,
so that everybody can follow.

01:05:58.120 --> 01:05:59.980
I hope you are following.

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.470
All right, then
now I can actually

01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:05.200
redistribute, arrange
all those terms

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.930
and the magic will happen.

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.680
So that means rearrange
all those terms,

01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:16.480
minus infinity to
infinity d omega C omega

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:22.450
exponential minus i
omega t minus x divided

01:06:22.450 --> 01:06:33.760
by Vg, exponential minus i
omega0t, exponential i omega0

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:39.310
over Vg plus b x.

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:42.070
So basically, there's
really no magic.

01:06:42.070 --> 01:06:45.940
What I'm doing is really to
rearrange all those terms,

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:49.010
so that this term is
actually rearranged

01:06:49.010 --> 01:06:53.150
so that it's now omega
times t minus x over Vg.

01:06:53.150 --> 01:06:55.090
It's an independent
exponential term.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:07:06.310
And I actually extract this term
times t to be returned here.

01:07:06.310 --> 01:07:08.850
I'm just rearranging things, OK?

01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:12.220
I'm not changing anything.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:17.800
And finally, I can merge
this term and that term,

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.900
and become this function field.

01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:30.420
I can immediately recognize
that after this rearrangement,

01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.800
this is just
re-writing the formula,

01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:36.460
putting all those terms
in different place.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:38.400
Of course, you can
actually review

01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:42.160
this part of the lecture
in the lecture notes later.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:46.000
But basically, we're not doing
anything fancy but rearranging

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:50.050
things over in different place.

01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:52.840
Then I can actually
quickly identify

01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:55.750
what I am trying to integrate.

01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:59.590
So this integration
is over omega.

01:07:59.590 --> 01:08:03.730
Therefore all those terms
are now related to omega.

01:08:03.730 --> 01:08:07.240
Therefore, they are just some
terms which are sitting there,

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.840
they don't participate.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:16.479
And if you focus on
this part, what is this?

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:21.880
If you compare that to the
original equation of which

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.500
I have here.

01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:27.399
If you compare that to the
original fs equation here,

01:08:27.399 --> 01:08:29.710
you can't immediately
identify that actually that's

01:08:29.710 --> 01:08:31.580
a function of fs.

01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:37.490
Originally this function
fs is a function of t.

01:08:37.490 --> 01:08:40.149
And I'm going to that board now.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:48.290
This is actually fs
with t minus x over Vg.

01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.960
Surprisingly simple.

01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:58.510
Now let's look at the right
hand side, this mass here.

01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:05.899
This is actually K0, which
actually you cannot see

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:06.399
anymore.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:10.700
It's in the back of this board.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.189
And then if you combine
these two terms,

01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:15.810
basically what you
get is exponential

01:09:15.810 --> 01:09:19.720
minus i omega0t minus K0x.

01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:24.229
So look at what we have done.

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:33.660
I got started with this
Fourier transform functional

01:09:33.660 --> 01:09:36.810
form of fs.

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:40.800
I multiplied fs
by cosine omega0t

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.210
and go to the complex notation.

01:09:43.210 --> 01:09:47.660
It becomes exponential
minus i omega0t.

01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:53.250
If I multiplied that, I get my
f function, which is like this.

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:55.910
You get additional term there.

01:09:55.910 --> 01:10:00.030
I rearrange things
and change the origin,

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:03.750
and I can rewrite ft in
this functional form.

01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:08.700
And I can have a relation
between the C related to fs

01:10:08.700 --> 01:10:12.930
to the C related to f of t.

01:10:12.930 --> 01:10:18.120
I propagate ft over
the full space,

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.690
and attain my sine, which is
the amplitude as a function

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:25.910
of place and the time.

01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:29.060
Until here, everything is exact.

01:10:29.060 --> 01:10:31.750
Then I have
introduced assumption,

01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:36.850
which is C of omega is only
sizable, only contributing,

01:10:36.850 --> 01:10:41.570
around omega zero, therefore
I can do approximation form

01:10:41.570 --> 01:10:46.520
for the K function, which
is this functional form.

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.770
Then I just do the integration.

01:10:48.770 --> 01:10:50.690
Then I found that, interesting!

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:58.020
This side is-- you
should be taking

01:10:58.020 --> 01:11:01.130
the real part of this thing.

01:11:01.130 --> 01:11:03.860
This side have two components.

01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:06.770
The first component
is fs, which is

01:11:06.770 --> 01:11:12.630
the original signal you put in,
the signal you want to send.

01:11:12.630 --> 01:11:18.080
It's actually progressing at
the speed of group velocity.

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.440
So now you understand what
this group velocity means.

01:11:22.440 --> 01:11:25.190
That's the speed
of the signal you

01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:29.510
want to send in the AM radio.

01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:32.460
And this thing is
actually modulated

01:11:32.460 --> 01:11:36.270
by exponential function,
which is actually

01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:44.720
the propagating at the speed
of Vp, equal to omega0 over K0.

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.620
So the carrier still,
after you actually

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:53.750
include many, many
terms contracting

01:11:53.750 --> 01:11:59.900
the f function, the sine
which is the amplitude,

01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:05.162
the trick is that only the
omega value around omega0

01:12:05.162 --> 01:12:06.460
contributes.

01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:10.550
If that happen, then
you can see that there

01:12:10.550 --> 01:12:13.610
are two structures
actually propagating

01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:16.520
at different speeds, and that
you can actually understand

01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:20.620
the structure independently.

01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:25.610
That means your signal
will not be distorted

01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:27.620
if you're sending it this way.

01:12:27.620 --> 01:12:30.020
But the difference
is that the speed

01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:34.350
of the signal you are
sending is actually

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.860
at the speed of group velocity.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:40.250
That is actually
the amazing fact

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:44.230
which actually enables
us to send signal

01:12:44.230 --> 01:12:49.640
over thousands and thousands
of miles away from the source.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.470
So what is actually
done is actually that,

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.810
suppose you have some
kind of radio station.

01:12:56.810 --> 01:13:01.860
You can send the radio, and the
radio will go over the place,

01:13:01.860 --> 01:13:05.450
and got refracted
by atmosphere--

01:13:05.450 --> 01:13:08.490
the atmosphere on Earth.

01:13:08.490 --> 01:13:13.350
Got refracted, and the receiver
from some place which is really

01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:15.710
distant from the
source can still

01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:21.170
see it without any
dispersion, as we show here.

01:13:21.170 --> 01:13:23.330
And it's actually
going to be propagating

01:13:23.330 --> 01:13:27.870
at the speed of group velocity.

01:13:27.870 --> 01:13:33.620
So you may not
actually believe that.

01:13:33.620 --> 01:13:37.360
How about we do a
simulation like what

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.950
we did before with MIT wave?

01:13:39.950 --> 01:13:43.730
So this is actually the
example which we did last time.

01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:45.450
We have an nit wave.

01:13:45.450 --> 01:13:48.950
We can compose that
into many, many pieces.

01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:52.730
And then see how it evolved
as a function of time.

01:13:52.730 --> 01:13:54.590
This is actually
without dispersion,

01:13:54.590 --> 01:13:57.770
therefore everything is perfect.

01:13:57.770 --> 01:14:00.760
So now I would like to
introduce some excitement there.

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:10.440
If I have dispersion, like
0.1, alpha is equal to 0.1,

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:11.860
and see will happen.

01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:16.690
Then just a reminder that
things will not go super well.

01:14:16.690 --> 01:14:19.140
Wait a second, what am I doing?

01:14:19.140 --> 01:14:23.080
This is actually still
without dispersion.

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:24.230
Sorry for that.

01:14:28.840 --> 01:14:31.730
It should be--

01:14:31.730 --> 01:14:35.180
OK, so let's take a look
at the triangular case.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:39.550
This is now with dispersion.

01:14:39.550 --> 01:14:43.390
And you can see that as a
reminder as a function of time,

01:14:43.390 --> 01:14:46.190
the shape of the signal
which you would like to send

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:49.160
is actually changing
as a function of time.

01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.020
And after a few
thousands of miles,

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:57.310
you will not even recognize the
original structure we put in.

01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:03.600
So that's the trouble
we are actually facing.

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.790
You can see that it's getting
wider and wider et cetera.

01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:18.250
So now what will happen if
I send this kind of signal.

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:20.820
This is a signal which you
have some kind of shape.

01:15:20.820 --> 01:15:23.880
You can imagine that there's
sounds kind of analogue.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:27.540
And I am now doing the
calculation to actually map

01:15:27.540 --> 01:15:29.870
all the individual components.

01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:32.820
And now I'm going to
propagate through the median.

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:39.060
And the blue is the original
non-dispersive median

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.350
situation.

01:15:40.350 --> 01:15:44.360
And the red is actually
the propagation

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.910
in a dispersive median.

01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:48.770
You can see the propagation
in a dispersive median

01:15:48.770 --> 01:15:53.160
is faster, because alpha is
actually larger than one--

01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:54.270
larger than zero.

01:15:54.270 --> 01:15:56.310
So it's actually, in
this case it's 0.1.

01:15:56.310 --> 01:16:03.975
And you can see that the red
cosine omega0t modulated signal

01:16:03.975 --> 01:16:12.480
is progressing, and the shape
of the analogue is not changing.

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:13.770
You can see that, right?

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:17.380
So it's very different from
what we actually see before

01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:20.130
with a single triangular pulse.

01:16:20.130 --> 01:16:21.420
Now you can see that, ha!

01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:24.360
Only when n gets
very large, I start

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.150
to be able to feed all
those little structures.

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:31.740
That means the end value, or say
the omega value, which I need

01:16:31.740 --> 01:16:34.429
is you really narrow,
a very narrow range,

01:16:34.429 --> 01:16:36.720
which will actually match
with what we have been doing.

01:16:36.720 --> 01:16:39.460
And now I start to
propagate all those things.

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:43.530
And you can see that the red
is actually traveling faster

01:16:43.530 --> 01:16:46.470
than the blue, which
is what we expect.

01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:48.730
And you can see
now, in the instance

01:16:48.730 --> 01:16:51.120
they actually
overlap each other,

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:54.420
you can see that envelope,
the shape of the envelope,

01:16:54.420 --> 01:16:55.230
is still the same.

01:16:55.230 --> 01:16:57.970
It's exactly what
we actually printed.

01:16:57.970 --> 01:17:01.800
And that actually brings me
to the end of my lecture.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:06.960
We have on understood how
the AM radio actually works.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.820
And next time, we
are going to talk

01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.170
about uncertainty principles.

01:17:11.170 --> 01:17:12.150
What the hell?

01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.520
What happened?

01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:17.460
And believe me,
they are actually

01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:19.272
connected to each other.

01:17:19.272 --> 01:17:21.970
Uncertainty principle is
actually highly related

01:17:21.970 --> 01:17:24.640
to wave and the vibrations.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:29.510
Thank you very much, and let me
know if you have any questions.

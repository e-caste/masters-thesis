00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.430
HONG LIU: OK, let us start.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.590
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.680
So first, let me just say a
few general things regarding

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.590
the logistics of this class.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.180
So you should have
these three handouts.

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.580
One, organization.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.070
One, outline.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.920
And then, one is for PSET 1.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.870
So let me just go over
briefly this organization

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:53.580
and the outline.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.245
So firstly in this class,
there's no textbooks.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.180
However, there are
many reviews available.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.240
But unfortunately, a
lot of those reviews,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.145
none of the single review is
suitable for the whole course.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.930
Yeah.

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.180
So I have listed
some of the reviews

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.565
at the end of this organization.

00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:31.880
Yeah.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.380
So along the way, I
will point it out,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.720
some specific references
or some specific parts

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.390
of certain reviews if they
are directly relevant.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.160
And also for this class,
there's no recitation.

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.580
Yeah, for advanced
courses like this,

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.720
department does not assign TA.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.350
So we don't have recitation.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.220
So I have my own office hour,
which is Monday 3:30 to 4:30.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.449
Just one hour before
the lecture on Monday.

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:10.949
Yeah.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:15.710
So if you have questions
or if you have-- yeah,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.220
just feel free to come.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.625
So if you have some
questions other time,

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:28.070
say, if this office hour
is not good for you,

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.430
I'm also happy to set up
some other time to meet you.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.420
Or, you can stay after the class
to ask questions, et cetera.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.970
Yeah.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.280
So whichever way is
more convenient to you.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.940
So today, we have this--
yeah, so form now on,

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.870
everything will be
just on the web.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.800
You should download
the future PSETs.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.600
Or if I put any lecture
notes or materials,

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.940
you should find them on the web.

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.700
And I assume you can all find
out the website of the course.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:14.680
And it's also listed here
in the organization page.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.060
In the organization page.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.530
So any questions so far?

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.260
Good.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.550
So this class there's no exam.

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.660
And the grades are solely based
on PSETs and the final project.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.530
And the PSETs will be
due every two weeks.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.940
So if you look at the calendar,
there are about like 5 PSETs.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.090
Then, for the last
three weeks, instead

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.880
of, say, handing a PSET, you're
handing in the small paper.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.810
Just whatever topics
you would like to choose

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.170
about the holographic duality.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.350
Yeah, just choose one topic.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.990
Write, say, 8 to 10-page paper.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.260
Either review or
some calculation

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.680
you would like to do, et cetera.

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.820
Yeah.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:16.360
So 5 PSET is 75%.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.160
And this final
project would be 25%.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:32.842
That's pretty much the
logistics regarding this class.

00:04:32.842 --> 00:04:34.300
Do you have any
questions regarding

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:39.650
the grading, regarding the
project or PSET, et cetera?

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:47.750
Good.

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.910
So let me say a few
words about this outline.

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:57.290
So this outline is
way too ambitious.

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.850
It gives you--
yeah, it just serves

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.380
to give you a rough
contour what we will cover.

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.140
But really, don't take it too
literally because-- first, we

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.990
are not going to cover
all seven chapters.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.320
That would be too much.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.325
So last time when I taught it,
I covered only three chapters.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:25.610
And so hopefully, this
time I will do four.

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.130
Hopefully, time I will do four.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.370
And I may also just deviate
from some of the things

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.630
here, depending on the pace or
depend on people's interests,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.410
et cetera.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.615
So this is going to be flexible.

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:44.160
If there are certain things
you would really very much like

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.130
to hear, you can
also let me know.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.760
I can think about it.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.250
In particular, among
the five, six, seven.

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.880
And I can think about it, maybe
I'll discuss some of them.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.122
Discuss some of them.

00:05:58.122 --> 00:05:59.270
Yeah.

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.880
Also, another thing if you keep
in mind is that in this class,

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:13.850
this is a class which will touch
on many different subjects,

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.380
say gravity, a little
bit of string theory.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:20.600
And also, quantum field
theories, et cetera.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.800
So in such a class, it's
almost impossible-- I

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:30.120
think it's just impossible
to really derive everything

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.000
in the self-contained way.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.710
And also, some of-- yeah, I
think some of your background

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.450
are also very different.

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:44.380
So the certain
part may not appear

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.500
self-contained to some of you.

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.670
So if there is anything
which is not familiar to you,

00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.650
if I just mention it,
if I just code it,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:56.380
if it's not familiar
with you, then

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.490
you make sure-- don't
hesitate to ask me,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:03.010
either during the class
or after the class,

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.960
so that I can help you
to make up on that.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.880
To make up on that.

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:13.460
And also, to keep in mind,
like other advanced graduate

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:20.200
classes, you actually mostly
learn outside the class.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.560
Inside the class,
it's mostly try

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.430
to provide you some motivations,
guidance, et cetera,

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:29.950
and give you a rough contour.

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.340
And your own reading
outside the class

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:40.772
actually should be the main
routes you learn things.

00:07:40.772 --> 00:07:42.105
The main route you learn things.

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:48.715
So any questions?

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:57.970
So during the class, please
feel free to ask questions.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:07:58.470
Yeah.

00:08:01.154 --> 00:08:02.570
Asking questions
are a great thing

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.470
because if something
you don't understand,

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:09.460
there's a very good chance quite
a few of your fellow students

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:10.930
also don't understand.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.466
So if you ask the
question, you're

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:13.840
not only helping
yourself, you're

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.680
also helping other people.

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.210
And you also help
me because then I

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.090
will know certain aspect
is not clear to you.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:24.360
Then, I will try to emphasize
it, or repeat it, et cetera.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.730
So please, do ask questions.

00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:31.320
And also, if you have any
feedback on the class,

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:36.090
whether it's too fast, too slow,
or problems are too hard or too

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:40.270
easy, the PSET is
too short for you,

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:44.360
just not challenging
enough, just let me know.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.540
Just let me know.

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.040
Yeah.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.420
Then, I will try to adjust.

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.670
And again, this is
a very important.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:57.270
Again, this is very
important because the-- yeah.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:00.580
This will help us to
improve the class.

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:02.670
To improve the class.

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:04.447
Any other questions?

00:09:04.447 --> 00:09:05.155
Or any questions?

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:12.590
OK.

00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:17.790
Then, let us start our lecture.

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:35.175
So first, we look at the hints
for the holographic duality.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:07.880
OK.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.750
So we start by doing a
multiple choice problem.

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:10.800
OK.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.880
So what is your answer?

00:11:15.235 --> 00:11:16.110
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:18.745 --> 00:11:19.370
HONG LIU: Good.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:23.270
So why is gravity?

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.995
AUDIENCE: We don't have a good
quantum theory of gravity.

00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:32.050
HONG LIU: Good.

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.360
So we don't have a good
quantum theory of gravity.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.068
Any other reason?

00:11:35.068 --> 00:11:37.200
AUDIENCE: Except string theory.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.890
HONG LIU: Yeah,
string theory is still

00:11:38.890 --> 00:11:43.930
not the-- I would say not yet
at the [INAUDIBLE] quantum

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.680
theory of gravity.

00:11:47.065 --> 00:11:47.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:51.690
HONG LIU: Yeah.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:53.590
Yeah, this is the
similar to that.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:58.476
We don't have a full theory
of gravity nonrealizable.

00:11:58.476 --> 00:12:00.690
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:12:00.690 --> 00:12:02.870
HONG LIU: Good.

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:04.950
Anything else?

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:06.080
Or any other opinions?

00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:11.998
Say you should choose any other
interaction other than gravity?

00:12:11.998 --> 00:12:13.741
AUDIENCE: Strong is
the strongest one.

00:12:13.741 --> 00:12:16.772
Strong is the strongest one.

00:12:16.772 --> 00:12:17.730
HONG LIU: That's right.

00:12:17.730 --> 00:12:20.188
You can also choose the gravity
because this is the weakest

00:12:20.188 --> 00:12:22.450
one.

00:12:22.450 --> 00:12:24.170
Yeah, so the gravity
is the weakest one.

00:12:24.170 --> 00:12:25.040
OK.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.360
So yeah.

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.500
So I think you have
said most of the things.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.670
And the gravity is very
different from the others.

00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:35.070
And in some sense, all
the others are understood.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.450
So a to c are now
understood to be

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:57.150
described by gauge theories
in the fixed spacetime.

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.410
So the fixed spacetime.

00:13:00.410 --> 00:13:06.250
In fact, mostly
we use Minkowski.

00:13:10.096 --> 00:13:10.595
Minkowski.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:22.120
And for example,
electromagnetism, [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.710
by QED.

00:13:23.710 --> 00:13:26.710
And the QED [INAUDIBLE]
gauge field.

00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:29.810
You want gauge theory
plus a Dirac fermion.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:30.590
Dirac theory.

00:13:33.770 --> 00:13:35.220
A Dirac theory.

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:44.750
And similarly, if you include
the weak interaction--

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:49.540
so there's something
called [INAUDIBLE] weak--

00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:55.460
it's described by su2
times u1 gauge theory.

00:13:55.460 --> 00:13:58.910
Described by su2
times u1 gauge theory.

00:13:58.910 --> 00:14:04.440
And also, the strong
interaction you know now

00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.690
is described by
su3 gauge theory.

00:14:10.390 --> 00:14:16.000
So for all those cases, the
basic theoretical structure

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.214
is understood.

00:14:17.214 --> 00:14:17.755
So the basic.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:34.640
OK.

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:37.470
In principle, we can
formulate those theories

00:14:37.470 --> 00:14:39.345
from first principle,
just use path integral.

00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:47.890
Say, [INAUDIBLE]
where [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:53.770
group just based on
principle, relation group.

00:14:53.770 --> 00:14:56.210
And then you can actually
formulate all the theory

00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.220
in the [INAUDIBLE] way.

00:14:59.220 --> 00:15:09.750
So in the sense, then any
calculation of theories

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:19.140
can be reduced to
certain algorithm.

00:15:27.020 --> 00:15:29.280
OK.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.670
Of course, this does
not imply we actually

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:35.720
know how to calculate
many quantities here.

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.990
It just say in principle,
they are calculable.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:41.430
We often don't have
the technical tool

00:15:41.430 --> 00:15:42.250
to calculate them.

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:44.864
For example, even in QCD.

00:15:44.864 --> 00:15:47.280
[INAUDIBLE] joint action, we
don't have the technical tool

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.240
to calculate certain things.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.970
But they are, in
principle, calculable.

00:15:50.970 --> 00:15:55.800
And we can write down the
algorithm to calculate it.

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.435
But for gravity,
this is different.

00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.840
So for gravity,
it's very different.

00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:07.755
So for gravity.

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:23.802
So now we understand
that classical gravity,

00:16:23.802 --> 00:16:25.010
it's just equal to spacetime.

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:31.000
It's just a theory of spacetime.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.125
So this is the content over
the general relativity.

00:16:35.252 --> 00:16:36.460
The general quantum activity.

00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:47.890
But at a quantum
level, we really

00:16:47.890 --> 00:16:53.980
don't have a precise idea
how to formulate the theory.

00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.740
So there are many questions
still not understood.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:17:00.800
Many, say, conceptual
questions still not understood.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:10.494
For example, a spacetime
should fluctuate.

00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:22.359
OK.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.040
The spacetime should
fluctuate because

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:26.420
of the quantum
fluctuation [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:29.220
in quantum anything fluctuates.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:38.510
And then, the natural question
is whether this is still--

00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:41.315
so natural question is whether
spacetime is still continuous.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:49.870
OK.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:52.280
So this is still [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:59.820
You need to replace it
by something discrete.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:04.040
And it's not even
clear right now

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.917
whether spacetime will remain
a fundamental notion when

00:18:09.917 --> 00:18:11.000
you go to quantum gravity.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.300
It could well be
that spacetime would

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.830
be replaced by something else.

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:29.220
And also, there are
many other questions.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:35.645
So for example, quantum
nature of black holes.

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:59.990
Or what should be the beginning
of the universe, et cetera.

00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.060
So all these questions
are not understood.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:11.630
Also, gravity is the
weakest interaction.

00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:20.340
It is actually
much, much weaker.

00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:23.320
We will see, it's
much, much weaker

00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.060
than all the other interactions.

00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:30.040
And also, people have been
speculate-- maybe actually

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.570
this feature can also be
actually a fundamental feature

00:19:34.570 --> 00:19:36.750
underlying in the special
role of the gravity.

00:19:47.382 --> 00:19:48.840
For many years, it
seemed to people

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:53.490
that these questions and
the gravity questions,

00:19:53.490 --> 00:19:55.882
they're completely unrelated.

00:19:55.882 --> 00:19:57.090
They're completely unrelated.

00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.612
They're a completely
different subject.

00:19:59.612 --> 00:20:02.120
And those are well understood,
but somehow those we

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.390
need completely new ideas.

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:06.800
So it came out a great surprise.

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.020
So it came out that
great surprise in 1997

00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:33.930
by [INAUDIBLE] that actually
they actually are equivalent.

00:20:33.930 --> 00:20:38.190
So the proposal
of the [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:41.970
is that the-- chalk.

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:55.270
Is that quantum
gravity is actually

00:20:55.270 --> 00:21:07.720
equal to field theories
on a fixed spacetime.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:18.750
So on a fixed
spacetime just means

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.510
that there's no gravity
here on the right-hand side.

00:21:23.510 --> 00:21:26.310
Because if there's gravity,
then you cannot have a fixed

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.502
spacetime.

00:21:27.502 --> 00:21:29.065
And spacetime
should be dynamical.

00:21:32.150 --> 00:21:35.180
So this is the equivalence
between quantum gravity

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:39.010
and just our ordinary
quantum field theories.

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:42.300
And this is ordinary
quantum mechanics.

00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:44.490
And this is a very
nontrivial quantum mechanics,

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:47.350
which we don't yet understand.

00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:50.210
OK.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:55.590
This equality should
be really understood

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.810
as the different descriptions
of the same quantum systems.

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:25.460
So two sides are
different descriptions

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.459
of the same quantum system.

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:38.400
So it just depends on
how you want to see it.

00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.860
So one way you see it,
you see a quantum gravity.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:43.360
Then from some other
way you see it,

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.568
you don't see gravity at all.

00:22:44.568 --> 00:22:46.710
You just see ordinary
quantum mechanics.

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:47.210
OK.

00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:57.280
Yeah, so this is what this
equality is supposed to mean.

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.710
So this equality essentially--
let me call this equation 1,

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.870
which I will often use later.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:14.700
So this equation 1 is
really a unification.

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.540
Unification, which
unifies quantum gravity

00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:28.320
with other field theory in
a rather unconventional way.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.470
Not in a standard
sense of unification.

00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:34.220
But that's bringing
them together.

00:23:34.220 --> 00:23:34.720
OK.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.870
So now, let me make some
philosophical remark.

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.980
Now, let me make some
philosophical remark.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:48.540
So last time, I
have checked when

00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:51.160
preparing this class this
[INAUDIBLE] original paper

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.700
has been cited more
than 10,000 times

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:59.780
in the [INAUDIBLE] Database.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.180
And so there's a
huge amount of work

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:07.430
has been devoted to
understanding this relation.

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:12.040
But in my opinion, this
subject's still in its infancy.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:13.800
And with many
elementary [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.550
we will see in the
course as course goes on,

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:19.150
there's still many
elementary issues

00:24:19.150 --> 00:24:21.800
which are not understood.

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:26.500
And to us, this relation
is still like a magic.

00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:30.830
And we don't really
have very good idea

00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:32.960
where this relation comes home.

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:37.270
We have some rough idea,
but not very precise idea.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:40.000
So the purpose of
physics, of course,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.690
is to turn what looks like a
magic or art into some rules

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:51.240
so that it becomes
something trivial.

00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.410
So at the beginning of
course of the gravity,

00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:55.930
Newtonian gravity was magic.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:58.290
But in the end--
and what Newton did

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:03.280
is to make the gravity to be
not different from the force we

00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:05.730
see in ordinary life.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:11.550
And similarly, for other--
yeah, for other interactions

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:14.880
we have seen before.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.930
Anyway.

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.340
So personally, I believe when
we really fully understand

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:23.710
this relation,
this will really be

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.710
a huge landmark in the physics.

00:25:27.710 --> 00:25:32.585
And comparable, say, maybe
to Newton's understanding

00:25:32.585 --> 00:25:36.480
of gravity or
Maxwell-Boltzmann, et cetera.

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:44.450
So the goal of this
course is to help

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:52.680
you understand how we--
our current understanding

00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.950
of this relation.

00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:59.670
And also, to help you to
derive the related-- yeah,

00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:03.490
so these are two very
different objects.

00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.170
And in order to set
up an inequality,

00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.794
you also need to
define a dictionary.

00:26:07.794 --> 00:26:09.210
For example, this
is like Chinese.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:10.580
This is like English.

00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:13.940
So you need to define a
dictionary between the two

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:16.250
and what one said to the other.

00:26:16.250 --> 00:26:18.590
So we will also work
out the dictionary.

00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:22.190
And also, we will
develop with the tools

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.180
and how to use this relation.

00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:25.920
And how to use the relation.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:29.940
And also, discuss many
features of this relation

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:32.630
and the implications.

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:35.650
So the purpose is to
help you to-- really,

00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:42.257
to bring to the forefront of
this very exciting subject.

00:26:42.257 --> 00:26:42.965
So any questions?

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:54.060
Good.

00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.980
No questions?

00:26:55.980 --> 00:27:05.240
OK, so now let's move to--
so after this introduction.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.310
So let's talk about this.

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.352
OK.

00:27:18.352 --> 00:27:19.685
So if you look at this relation.

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.040
So looking from the
right-hand side.

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.150
So you just have some kind
of ordinary field theory--

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.850
ordinary quantum
mechanical system, which

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:36.070
we, in principle, know
very well conceptually,

00:27:36.070 --> 00:27:39.140
without any gravity at all.

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:46.090
Somehow, if you view it in some
different way than the gravity

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.460
and the spacetime, and
the dynamical spacetime

00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:51.760
should emerge out of this.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:28:02.250
So in some sense, this 1 implies
that the quantum gravity-- so

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:06.140
let me just use
the quantum gravity

00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:07.580
plus the dynamical spacetime.

00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:16.930
OK, dynamical spacetime.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:22.788
So it's important it's
a dynamical spacetime--

00:28:22.788 --> 00:28:33.330
can really merge from
non-gravitational system.

00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:47.500
It can emerge from a
non-gravitational system.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:56.980
So the idea of emergence of
gravity from some other degrees

00:28:56.980 --> 00:29:01.820
freedom is not a
really new idea.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:13.150
So [INAUDIBLE] in
1967, Sakharov,

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:18.080
who was a Russian physicist.

00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.290
Sakharov is a very common name,
a very common Russian name.

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:24.080
But this is the most famous one.

00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:30.670
This is the most
famous Sakharov who

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:36.390
has invented the hydrogen bomb
for the former Soviet Union.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:41.370
And he was also the guy
who also later, I think,

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:45.320
got Nobel Peace Prize for
some human rights stuff.

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:54.410
But he was also a very excellent
physicist, including this idea

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:57.040
of emergence of the gravity.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.340
So what he observed
is that-- he found

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:01.900
actually certain [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.530
He would study, say, some
materials, et cetera.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:09.030
Then, he finds that
certain [INAUDIBLE] systems

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.630
can actually have
mathematical description which

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:16.920
looks like a magic
connection, et cetera.

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.150
Yeah, just
mathematical, it looks

00:30:23.150 --> 00:30:25.150
like the equation for the
magic and the equation

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:27.290
for the connection, et cetera.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:30.450
And then he was speculating,
maybe the general relativity

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:34.560
can actually arise just from
some kind of electron systems,

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:37.170
just from the ordinary
[INAUDIBLE] systems,

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:40.055
and as effective description.

00:30:46.730 --> 00:30:51.140
And in fact, in the 1950s,
even before the Sakharov

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:56.330
have [INAUDIBLE] idea,
people working in GR,

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:59.170
in General Relativity,
they already

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:08.690
found many striking parallel
between Einstein's equations

00:31:08.690 --> 00:31:14.600
and also associated many
phenomena we hydrodynamics.

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.860
And so we know that
hydrodynamics is really

00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:20.200
just an effective description.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.895
And if you just look at
the river-- so in fact,

00:31:23.895 --> 00:31:26.890
it's the discrete
water molecules.

00:31:26.890 --> 00:31:30.210
But if you describe the
motion of the water molecules

00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.340
at a microscopic level, then
you find the hydrodynamics.

00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.256
But the hydrodynamics
does not apply

00:31:35.256 --> 00:31:36.380
at more fundamental levels.

00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:40.610
So it's more like some
kind of effective theory.

00:31:40.610 --> 00:31:43.750
So in the 1950s,
people already found

00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:48.570
that there are many features
of Einstein equation--

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:49.984
it's reminiscent.

00:31:49.984 --> 00:31:51.900
Actually, just reminiscent
of certain features

00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:53.055
of hydrodynamics.

00:31:53.055 --> 00:31:54.800
So there's already
this suspicion

00:31:54.800 --> 00:32:01.170
that maybe the gravity
or spacetime actually can

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:03.250
emerge out of something else.

00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:06.600
Just like the hydrodynamics
is not a fundamental theory.

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:12.130
It actually emerges
from molecules,

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:13.580
dynamics of the molecules.

00:32:16.225 --> 00:32:16.725
Anyway.

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:27.650
So from the field
theory perspective,

00:32:27.650 --> 00:33:12.770
it's also natural to ask whether
massless spin-2 particles can

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:29.535
arise as bound state, say,
of lower spin particles.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.280
Say, like spin-1.

00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.620
Like photons, which are spin-1.

00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:46.916
So photons.

00:33:46.916 --> 00:33:48.430
Or gluons in QCD.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:55.600
Electrons, or quarks, et cetera.

00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.710
So these are the spin
[INAUDIBLE] objects.

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:12.170
And if yes-- so massless
spin-2 particle in some sense--

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:16.520
so when you learn
QR, you might have

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:21.580
learned that the massless spin-2
particle may be considered

00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:25.537
as a hallmark form of
gravity because of the-- so

00:34:25.537 --> 00:34:29.830
the basic propogation.

00:34:29.830 --> 00:34:32.230
The gravitational wave.

00:34:32.230 --> 00:34:35.179
So the basic propogation
of the gravity

00:34:35.179 --> 00:34:36.800
is the gravitational wave.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.030
And that's propogated
as spin-2 particles.

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:46.159
And if you quantize the theory--
a propogation as spin-2 object.

00:34:46.159 --> 00:34:50.060
And when you quantize
the gravitational waves,

00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.350
then they become massless
spin-2 particles.

00:34:53.350 --> 00:34:55.659
They become spin-2 particles.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:58.810
So in some sense,
if your theory can

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:03.970
allow the massless
spin-2 particles

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:07.160
as-- so if your theory contains
the massless spin-2 particles,

00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.841
then they must contain gravity.

00:35:08.841 --> 00:35:09.340
OK.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:46.490
So for example, even in strong
interaction, which are, say,

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:49.810
the theory describes
gluons and the quarks.

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.770
And the gluons and the
quarks, they can indeed form.

00:35:52.770 --> 00:35:56.660
So these are the
gluons and the quarks.

00:36:03.642 --> 00:36:12.435
In [INAUDIBLE], they're
indeed spin-2 bound states.

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.920
The gluons are spin-1,
quarks are spin [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:20.345
But you combine
them together, you

00:36:20.345 --> 00:36:22.870
can make [INAUDIBLE] the
spin-2 bound state, even just

00:36:22.870 --> 00:36:23.828
in strong interactions.

00:36:26.930 --> 00:36:30.647
But of course in nature,
the spin-2 bound state,

00:36:30.647 --> 00:36:31.480
they're all massive.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:38.660
They're all massive.

00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:42.750
And there are some very
unstable, massive particles.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:45.510
When you create them,
immediate decay.

00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:47.265
So they cannot be gravity.

00:36:47.265 --> 00:36:49.622
For gravity, you need
massless spin-2 particles.

00:36:55.430 --> 00:36:57.890
But if you look at this fact,
you cannot have the feeling.

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.950
Say, maybe I take the QCD.

00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:04.240
Maybe I take a little bit.

00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:07.040
Maybe I can make that
spin-2 massive particles

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.680
into some massless
spin-2 particles.

00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.180
Then I would have generated the
gravity from a QCD like series.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.400
And then, that would
be a revolution.

00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:20.270
And then you will be immortal.

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.920
But unfortunately,
even though this

00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:30.360
was a very promising
idea for many years,

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:37.376
and this hope was
actually completely dashed

00:37:37.376 --> 00:37:43.070
by a powerful theorem
of Weinberg and Witten.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:45.470
So there's a powerful
theorem from Weinberg-Witten

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:48.380
that say this can never happen.

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:53.665
So this is the--
they're not possible.

00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:13.380
So this is 1980.

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:15.864
So the paper.

00:38:15.864 --> 00:38:18.510
If you want, you can
take a look at the paper.

00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:30.290
So this is volume
96 and the page 59.

00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:36.150
So they proved two
theorems in that paper.

00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:38.180
So let me just copy
the theorem down.

00:38:42.070 --> 00:38:44.780
Copy the theorem down.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:39:04.240
So they say a theory that
allows the construction

00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:23.410
of a Lorentz-covariant
and the conserved current

00:39:23.410 --> 00:39:26.100
for a vector-- current.

00:39:30.370 --> 00:39:56.470
Say, j mu, cannot contain
massless particles.

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:10.180
Cannot contain massless
particles of spin greater than

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:29.454
1/2 with non-vanishing
value of-- OK,

00:40:29.454 --> 00:40:30.495
so this is first theorem.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:46.100
So the second theorem-- I think
I should have enough space.

00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:47.120
So the second theorem.

00:40:54.490 --> 00:41:05.360
Second theorem says
that a theory that

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:19.980
allows a covariant,
Lorentz-covariant,

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:24.430
and the conserved stress tensor.

00:41:27.570 --> 00:41:29.080
So let me just call it T mu mu.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:53.460
A stress tensor cannot contain
massless particles of spin j

00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.210
greater than 1.

00:42:05.930 --> 00:42:08.980
So the key-- so
let me just repeat

00:42:08.980 --> 00:42:11.640
the theorem a little bit.

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:16.140
So the first theorem said if
you have a Lorentz-covariant

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:21.510
and the conserved current,
and in such a theory

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:29.960
there's no charged particles
can have spin more than 1/2.

00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.210
So there's no charged particle
can have spin more than 1/2.

00:42:34.210 --> 00:42:37.990
Of course, this cannot
contain graviton.

00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:42.590
And the second theorem says
if you have a conserved stress

00:42:42.590 --> 00:42:47.550
tensor, Lorentz-covariant and
a conserved stress tensor,

00:42:47.550 --> 00:42:50.210
then this theory cannot contain
any particles with spin greater

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:53.020
than 1.

00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.410
So of course, this cannot
also contain a graviton.

00:42:55.410 --> 00:42:57.100
Graviton would be a spin-2.

00:43:00.820 --> 00:43:03.570
So this theorem-- yes?

00:43:03.570 --> 00:43:06.001
AUDIENCE: Is there anything
like RG flow of mass?

00:43:06.001 --> 00:43:06.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:09.170 --> 00:43:10.940
HONG LIU: This is final mass.

00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:12.250
Yeah.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:14.875
Just the [INAUDIBLE] mass.

00:43:14.875 --> 00:43:16.750
You don't talk about
even normalization here.

00:43:22.086 --> 00:43:25.090
Yeah, this is just
[INAUDIBLE] statement.

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:33.240
So this theorem turned out to
be actually very easy to prove.

00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:36.080
And in some sense, it's
rather instructive.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:41.250
And just to give you the sense
of the power of this theorem,

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.340
we will prove it
in a little bit.

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:48.850
So before proving
it, I will first

00:43:48.850 --> 00:43:52.970
make some remarks to
make you appreciate

00:43:52.970 --> 00:43:54.840
what these two theorems means.

00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.222
Do you have any questions
before I do that?

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:08.700
OK, good.

00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:11.160
So let me just make some
remarks on this theorem.

00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:51.810
So the first remark is that
the theorems really apply

00:44:51.810 --> 00:44:57.860
to any particles, to both.

00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:59.700
So normally we say the
fundamental particle

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:04.640
is the particle which
you put in your theory is

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:09.040
the particle which say--
yeah, let me say [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:11.300
Rather fundamental, let
me call it elementary.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:13.780
So the particle which already
appear in your Lagrangian.

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:21.520
And composite particles.

00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:24.955
Composite particles, say, would
be some kind of bound state

00:45:24.955 --> 00:45:27.020
or some particles
which don't appear

00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:30.870
in your original Lagrangian.

00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:35.050
So this theorem does
not distinguish them.

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:39.690
As far as you have some
particles, [INAUDIBLE] region.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:50.670
So now, let's try to see whether
this theorem is compatible

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:55.280
to [INAUDIBLE] these
things we already know.

00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.045
So let's first try to
apply to, say, QED.

00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:15.400
So the theorem is
compatible with QED.

00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:37.860
So we know that QED is a Maxwell
theory plus Dirac's theory.

00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:47.150
And then the Dirac-- and the
fermions in the Dirac theory

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:50.760
interact with the photons
in the Maxwell theory.

00:46:50.760 --> 00:46:55.540
So this theory have a
massless photon of spin-1.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:47:00.300
And this will have a conserved
charge because of, say,

00:47:00.300 --> 00:47:02.656
electrons that do have a charge.

00:47:02.656 --> 00:47:04.155
This theory has a
conserved current.

00:47:10.770 --> 00:47:12.490
Has a conserved current.

00:47:12.490 --> 00:47:16.770
But this theory does
allow a spin-1 particle.

00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:19.340
It does allow the
spin-1 particle.

00:47:19.340 --> 00:47:24.580
And this is not contradictory
with the theorem 1.

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:27.170
So theorem 1 said if you
have a Lorentz [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:27.170 --> 00:47:30.890
and the conserved current,
then you cannot have massless

00:47:30.890 --> 00:47:33.505
particle of spin 1/2 with
non-vanishing charge.

00:47:39.270 --> 00:47:41.036
In this case,
photon is massless.

00:47:41.036 --> 00:47:42.410
But photon does
not carry charge.

00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:56.910
Photon is neutral under
the electric charge.

00:48:00.330 --> 00:48:02.182
So the existence
of the photon is

00:48:02.182 --> 00:48:03.390
compatible with that theorem.

00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:12.870
And now, let's look at
the [INAUDIBLE] theory

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:16.591
which also contain
massless spin-1 particle.

00:48:16.591 --> 00:48:19.090
And the [INAUDIBLE] theory which
contain the spin-1 particle

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:20.285
is the Yang-Mill theory.

00:48:27.930 --> 00:48:29.430
So Yang-Mill theory.

00:48:29.430 --> 00:48:31.783
For example, let's consider
su2 Yang-Mill theory.

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:40.840
So the Yang-Mill theory have
three gauge field, A mu a.

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:43.792
And a is equal to 1, 2, 3.

00:48:43.792 --> 00:48:49.175
Because 1 and 2 [INAUDIBLE]
of su2 gauge symmetry.

00:49:00.981 --> 00:49:02.480
And from this three
gauge field, you

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:07.010
can combine them into
the following form.

00:49:07.010 --> 00:49:09.670
I have A mu 3.

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:12.130
Then, I have A mu plus minus.

00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:20.360
You could do 1 over square root
2 a mu 1 plus minus A mu 2.

00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:20.860
OK.

00:49:25.850 --> 00:49:28.510
So [INAUDIBLE].

00:49:28.510 --> 00:49:34.670
So you can easily check yourself
that this a mu plus minus

00:49:34.670 --> 00:49:39.625
is massless spin-1 particle.

00:49:45.785 --> 00:49:46.285
Particles.

00:49:49.280 --> 00:49:51.430
Can create massless
spin-1 particles

00:49:51.430 --> 00:50:13.290
charged under the u1 subgroup
generated by sigma 3.

00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:20.770
So sigma 3 is the generator
associated with A mu 3.

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:23.780
And so those two are charged
under this generator.

00:50:26.330 --> 00:50:30.430
So now, [INAUDIBLE] we
have a contradiction

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:33.570
because those are massless
spin-1 particles charged

00:50:33.570 --> 00:50:34.100
under this.

00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:43.230
And the theorem 1 said you
have a conserved current,

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:47.200
then you cannot have
any particle recharged--

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:50.542
any charged particle with
spin greater than 1/2.

00:50:50.542 --> 00:50:52.000
But those are the
spin-1 particles.

00:50:55.050 --> 00:50:58.150
But actually, we're consistent.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:07.030
Because as you may remember,
in Yang-Mills theory

00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:13.440
there does not exist-- that
actually does not exist.

00:51:17.288 --> 00:51:19.140
The way out [INAUDIBLE]
there does not

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:43.350
exist a conserved
Lorentz-covariant current

00:51:43.350 --> 00:51:47.504
for actually-- for this u1.

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:53.390
For the u1 generated by
this sigma 3 divided by 2.

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:56.692
So this is actually compatible.

00:51:56.692 --> 00:51:59.150
This is actually compatible
because such a current does not

00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:00.351
exist.

00:52:00.351 --> 00:52:00.850
OK.

00:52:05.010 --> 00:52:09.210
So you will show this fact
yourself in your PSET.

00:52:09.210 --> 00:52:10.750
But you may
remember, if you have

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:14.500
studied quantum
field theory 2, then

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:18.240
you may remember this
fact from the discussion

00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.750
of [INAUDIBLE] gauge theories.

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:26.570
So in this course, we
will from time to time

00:52:26.570 --> 00:52:30.300
use various facts of,
say, [INAUDIBLE] theories.

00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:36.310
But they're not essential.

00:52:36.310 --> 00:52:39.570
If you don't allow
[INAUDIBLE] theories,

00:52:39.570 --> 00:52:42.090
you can still
understand this duality.

00:52:42.090 --> 00:52:44.600
You can still understand
the relation one.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.910
But of course, if you know gauge
field, it will help you a lot.

00:52:53.790 --> 00:52:55.030
Any questions about this?

00:53:01.630 --> 00:53:03.760
Good.

00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:04.490
Let's continue.

00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:38.950
So this theorem does not
forbid graviton from GR.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:48.780
So if you try to quantize
Einstein's general relativity

00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:51.540
around the flash
space for example,

00:53:51.540 --> 00:53:54.776
then you will find the
massless spin-2 particle.

00:53:54.776 --> 00:53:56.150
So this is what
we call graviton.

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:08.260
And this is not contradictory
with that theorem 2.

00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:17.270
It's because you
may still remember

00:54:17.270 --> 00:54:21.080
when you learn GR is that in
GR, General Relativity, actually

00:54:21.080 --> 00:54:22.995
there is not.

00:54:22.995 --> 00:54:23.870
There's no conserved.

00:54:27.080 --> 00:54:30.050
So here, it's conserved.

00:54:30.050 --> 00:54:33.260
Not covariantly
converged, just conserved.

00:54:33.260 --> 00:54:38.860
Lorentz-covariant stress tensor.

00:54:41.805 --> 00:54:42.305
OK.

00:54:45.670 --> 00:54:48.554
So in GR, actually
there's no conserved

00:54:48.554 --> 00:54:52.000
in the Lorentz-covariant
stress tensor.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.810
So actually, the GR
[INAUDIBLE] graviton.

00:55:01.230 --> 00:55:07.517
But this theorem 2, it's
nevertheless, very powerful.

00:55:07.517 --> 00:55:08.850
It's nevertheless very powerful.

00:55:13.470 --> 00:55:22.700
It said very powerful.

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:26.496
It said all [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:36.938 --> 00:55:50.696
None of [INAUDIBLE] QFTs
in Minkowski spacetime,

00:55:50.696 --> 00:55:59.660
which is the one we
normally work with,

00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.585
can have emergent gravity.

00:56:21.850 --> 00:56:24.210
OK.

00:56:24.210 --> 00:56:28.100
So QCD like theories,
no matter how

00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:35.100
you try to trick the theory,
the spin-2 massive bound state

00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:37.330
can never become massless.

00:56:37.330 --> 00:56:40.630
They can never become massless.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:44.275
Because those series,
they do-- for example,

00:56:44.275 --> 00:56:46.160
our QCD, our strong
interaction, they

00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:51.070
do have a covariantly
conserved stress tensor.

00:56:51.070 --> 00:56:53.670
A Lorentz-covariant
conserved stress tensor.

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:06.380
But this theorem
does not validate

00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:10.130
this equation 1 I just erased.

00:57:10.130 --> 00:57:14.740
Because this theorem, even
though it's very powerful,

00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:17.330
it does have a
hidden assumption.

00:57:20.056 --> 00:57:21.430
It does have a
hidden assumption.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:35.772
This assumption is so
obvious and so self-evident,

00:57:35.772 --> 00:57:39.620
that even though
Weinberg and Witten,

00:57:39.620 --> 00:57:41.820
they're extremely
careful people,

00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:43.870
they did not bother
to mention it.

00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:52.130
In those times, nobody
with their right mind

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:55.050
would have mentioned
such a thing.

00:57:55.050 --> 00:58:02.190
So the hidden assumption is
that the kind of particles

00:58:02.190 --> 00:58:08.400
they are talking about-- is that
the particles are they talking

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:18.170
about, the particles, which
they tried to rule out,

00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:29.261
live in the same spacetime
as original theory.

00:58:36.411 --> 00:58:36.910
OK.

00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:44.900
So if you write down,
say, QED in Minkowski

00:58:44.900 --> 00:58:47.640
spacetime, and
then you ask about

00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:53.586
whether you can have some spin-2
particles coming out from QED.

00:58:53.586 --> 00:58:54.960
And then of course,
you ask about

00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.890
whether you have
particles come out

00:58:56.890 --> 00:58:59.470
QED living in the same
Minkowski spacetime.

00:59:04.271 --> 00:59:04.770
Yeah.

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:09.070
So in some sense, this
assumption is self-evident.

00:59:09.070 --> 00:59:14.710
But precisely,
this is assumption,

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:21.120
which taking advantage by
this relation, which first

00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:25.000
envisioned by [INAUDIBLE],
is that precisely

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.840
in this relation, in this
equation 1 which I raised,

00:59:30.840 --> 00:59:33.330
that the gravity
actually does not

00:59:33.330 --> 00:59:37.710
live in the same spacetime
as the original theory.

00:59:37.710 --> 00:59:40.410
And does not live in the same
spacetime as original theory.

00:59:44.780 --> 00:59:50.810
So even in the early
days, when people

00:59:50.810 --> 00:59:56.850
were trying to dream having
such kind of spin-2 particles

00:59:56.850 --> 00:59:59.800
that come from
QCD like theories,

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:07.040
there's already an
immediate puzzle.

01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:18.250
Suppose the QCD like theories
can have emergent graviton

01:00:18.250 --> 01:00:21.280
in the same spacetime.

01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:25.500
Then firstly, your QCD theory
is defined in a fix spacetime.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.240
But now if it contains spin-2
particle in the spacetime

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.500
itself, it will be dynamical.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:34.570
Then, where does the original
QCD theory [INAUDIBLE]?

01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:35.660
OK.

01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:38.810
And then you will
just similarly go

01:00:38.810 --> 01:00:40.890
into this kind of
self-contradiction,

01:00:40.890 --> 01:00:44.410
like somehow-- how
can that-- yeah.

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:45.270
Anyway.

01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:59.370
So in this relation, in
the holographic duality,

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:12.550
gravity does not live
in the same spacetime.

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:19.200
OK.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:25.370
So this, in fact, live in
one dimension or higher,

01:01:25.370 --> 01:01:27.490
or they can be several
dimension higher depending

01:01:27.490 --> 01:01:29.560
on the examples.

01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:32.130
So this void this
theorem in obvious way.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:39.670
And also, void this
conundrum I said earlier.

01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:41.590
Because in a
different spacetime.

01:01:41.590 --> 01:01:44.090
So the field theory is still
in the fixed spacetime,

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:48.166
but then the gravity
then can be dynamical.

01:01:48.166 --> 01:01:50.540
Then, the spacetime which
gravity lives can be dynamical.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:56.610
So any questions
regarding this so far?

01:01:56.610 --> 01:01:57.850
Yes.

01:01:57.850 --> 01:01:59.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
in GR, there

01:01:59.530 --> 01:02:01.670
was no conserved
Lorentz-covariant stress

01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:02.170
tensor.

01:02:02.170 --> 01:02:04.850
Because the covariant
derivative of the stress

01:02:04.850 --> 01:02:07.160
tensor [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:07.160 --> 01:02:10.190
HONG LIU: No covariant
derivative is not conserved.

01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:13.700
This covariant is not conserved.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.740
Conserved means the
ordinary derivatives, not

01:02:15.740 --> 01:02:19.550
the covariant derivatives.

01:02:19.550 --> 01:02:22.816
A covariant conserved stress
tensor is not conserved.

01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:30.360
If you write down a
conserved stress tensor,

01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.520
then it's not covariant.

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:36.610
Then it's not covariant.

01:02:36.610 --> 01:02:38.450
Yeah.

01:02:38.450 --> 01:02:42.580
Similar thing with this
case for the gauge fields.

01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:51.690
And in this case, gauge
invariant currents--

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.735
the gauge invariant and
the conserved currents

01:02:54.735 --> 01:02:57.000
is not Lorentz-covariants.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:01.480
And the Lorentz-covariants,
gauge invariant current

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:02.738
then is not conserved.

01:03:10.073 --> 01:03:10.874
Any other question?

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:12.040
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

01:03:12.040 --> 01:03:13.505
HONG LIU: Yes.

01:03:13.505 --> 01:03:14.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:24.884 --> 01:03:25.550
HONG LIU: Sorry.

01:03:25.550 --> 01:03:26.856
Say it again?

01:03:26.856 --> 01:03:29.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] theory,
every particle is massless.

01:03:29.230 --> 01:03:29.813
HONG LIU: Yes.

01:03:29.813 --> 01:03:33.900
AUDIENCE: And the [INAUDIBLE]
spin-2 particle, which carries

01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:34.400
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:40.730
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:44.240
For [INAUDIBLE] field theory,
indeed everything's massless.

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:47.200
You can construct
Lorentz-covariants

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.980
conserved stress tensor.

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:56.590
So that theory [INAUDIBLE] does
not allow spin-2 excitations

01:03:56.590 --> 01:03:57.955
in the same spacetime.

01:03:57.955 --> 01:03:58.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:03.284 --> 01:04:05.200
HONG LIU: There's no
massless spin-2 particle.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:09.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:16.865 --> 01:04:17.490
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:20.840
Yeah, but you don't
have massless spin-2.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:25.040
You don't have massless
spin-2 particles.

01:04:25.040 --> 01:04:27.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.350
HONG LIU: No.

01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:31.250
It depends.

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:34.550
Actually, talking about the
massless in the [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:34.550 --> 01:04:36.500
field theory is a
little bit tricky.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:39.150
It's a little bit tricky.

01:04:39.150 --> 01:04:41.700
They come in all
kind of spectrum.

01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.120
They come in the
continuous spectrum.

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.160
Yeah.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:50.990
Yeah, but this theorem does
apply to ordinary [INAUDIBLE]

01:04:50.990 --> 01:04:52.820
field theories.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:57.862
So in those theories,
you won't have massless.

01:04:57.862 --> 01:04:59.570
Yeah, when we prove
the theorem, then you

01:04:59.570 --> 01:05:02.270
can see precisely
what do we mean

01:05:02.270 --> 01:05:04.190
by massless spin-2 particles.

01:05:13.170 --> 01:05:16.922
If you stay in the course,
then you will know.

01:05:16.922 --> 01:05:18.860
Yeah.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:22.270
Yeah, we will see it later on.

01:05:22.270 --> 01:05:25.040
But not for a while.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:27.050
Not for a couple of weeks.

01:05:27.050 --> 01:05:29.360
And maybe in a couple of
weeks, we will see it.

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:33.685
In two weeks.

01:05:33.685 --> 01:05:35.217
One or two weeks.

01:05:35.217 --> 01:05:36.050
Any other questions?

01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:40.700
OK.

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:45.970
So now, let me give you the
proof, which is pretty simple.

01:05:45.970 --> 01:05:51.610
And use some elementary
facts, very elementary facts.

01:05:51.610 --> 01:05:56.820
Because you see, this theorem
contains very little input.

01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.316
That theorem really contained
very, very little input.

01:06:00.316 --> 01:06:01.690
So if you can
prove such a thing,

01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:03.470
it cannot be complicated.

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:06.480
If you can prove it, it
cannot be complicated.

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:07.920
Because the input is so little.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:10.520
It does not require any details.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:13.540
It does not require any
details of a theory.

01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:15.250
So if you can prove
such a theorem,

01:06:15.250 --> 01:06:18.480
it must be just from kinematics,
not come from any dynamics.

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:25.720
So indeed, that's
how the theorem goes.

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:26.805
So the proof.

01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:34.480
So we will do proof
by contradiction

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:38.140
as you would naturally expect.

01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:53.420
So let us suppose there exists
a massless spin-j particle.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.590
Massless particles.

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.660
So let's assume
this theory contains

01:06:57.660 --> 01:07:02.700
some theories [INAUDIBLE] exist
massless spin-2 particles.

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.340
Massless particles of spin-j.

01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:13.110
And just from the
Lorentz symmetry,

01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:15.080
you can immediately
write down-- so

01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:20.630
from what we learned
in QFT 1 and 2.

01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:23.600
So just by Lorentz symmetry--
it doesn't matter what

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.850
is the nature of those states.

01:07:28.220 --> 01:07:30.240
Because the mass
formal representations

01:07:30.240 --> 01:07:34.760
over the, say, Lorentz
group and [INAUDIBLE] group.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:39.560
So [INAUDIBLE] immediately write
down the one particle state

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.330
of such particles.

01:07:41.330 --> 01:07:45.220
And you normally can
write them as k and sigma.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.685
So k just is the ordinary
spacetime momentum.

01:07:55.650 --> 01:07:57.760
So for massless
particle, of course

01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:00.640
the k0 squared should
be equal to k squared.

01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:06.960
And the sigma is the helicity.

01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:09.210
Helicity is a projection
of the angular momentum

01:08:09.210 --> 01:08:12.010
in the direction
of your momentum.

01:08:12.010 --> 01:08:16.689
And for a massless
particle of spin-j,

01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:19.149
the sigma can only
be plus minus j.

01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:20.315
So this is helicity.

01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:28.300
So if you don't
remember this, you

01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:34.399
can go back to review
Wemberg's book.

01:08:34.399 --> 01:08:39.420
Wemberg's volume 1 QFT.

01:08:39.420 --> 01:08:46.580
Volume 1, Section 2.5
discussed how you write down

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:52.870
the general one particle
states for, say,

01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:56.060
any quantum-- in
any quantum theory

01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:57.609
as far as you have
Lorentz symmetry.

01:08:57.609 --> 01:08:58.109
OK.

01:09:03.550 --> 01:09:06.990
And the one properties
of this sigma

01:09:06.990 --> 01:09:08.494
is that let's now
consider rotation.

01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:14.490
Now, let's consider rotation.

01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:15.990
So let's consider
rotation operator.

01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:35.370
This [INAUDIBLE] by angle theta
around the direction of the k.

01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:41.359
Around the direction of the k,
which is the direction of the k

01:09:41.359 --> 01:09:41.859
here.

01:09:49.140 --> 01:09:52.410
So let's consider
the action of these

01:09:52.410 --> 01:09:59.870
under state, this one particle--
this massless particle state.

01:09:59.870 --> 01:10:07.930
Then by definition,
this just give you

01:10:07.930 --> 01:10:13.230
i sigma theta k, sigma.

01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:17.050
So this is essentially come from
the definition of the helicity.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:22.050
And the k does not change
because this is the rotation

01:10:22.050 --> 01:10:25.430
along the direction of the k.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.960
The k itself does not change.

01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:35.890
But this eigenstate of
this rotation [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:35.890 --> 01:10:36.470
OK.

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:42.910
Again, if you don't remember
this, go back to Wemberg's book

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:44.760
and you can easily find it.

01:10:47.940 --> 01:11:08.990
So now if you have
a conserved current,

01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:16.800
if you have a covariant
conserved current,

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.460
J mu, then you can
always construct

01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:23.280
the charge, the
conserved charge,

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:26.640
which is the integral over J0.

01:11:26.640 --> 01:11:31.250
And similarly, if you have
T mu mu, then from T mu mu,

01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:44.610
you can construct a momentum
operator, which is the T mu.

01:11:44.610 --> 01:11:47.225
So this is just the
standard momentum operator

01:11:47.225 --> 01:11:50.527
in your field theory.

01:11:50.527 --> 01:11:51.860
So this is just still the setup.

01:11:57.262 --> 01:12:07.530
Of course just by definition,
the p mu acting on k sigma,

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:11.007
you just get back k mu.

01:12:11.007 --> 01:12:12.840
OK, because this is the
momentum eigenstate.

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:22.420
And if this particle
is also charged

01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:40.230
under this conserved charge,
then-- so if charged under k,

01:12:40.230 --> 01:12:47.150
under this conserved charge,
then Q act on this state

01:12:47.150 --> 01:12:51.420
will also give you the charge q.

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.262
So this is operator.

01:12:53.262 --> 01:12:53.970
This is operator.

01:12:56.762 --> 01:12:57.720
These are all operator.

01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:05.470
Operator.

01:13:05.470 --> 01:13:09.400
And then, this should
give you charge q.

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:14.460
So now we want to show
this 2 theorem implies--

01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:21.500
so with this set up,
this theorem can--

01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:25.080
so we want to show two things.

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:34.070
1, if q is nonzero, that means
if the particle is charged

01:13:34.070 --> 01:13:41.945
under a conserved charge, then
j must be smaller than 1/2.

01:13:41.945 --> 01:13:43.730
It cannot be greater than 1/2.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:50.870
So we assume it's a
conserved stress tensor.

01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:54.970
Otherwise, j should be always
smaller or equal to 1 at most.

01:13:54.970 --> 01:13:55.470
OK.

01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:00.930
So that's what
that theorem means

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:03.760
translated in this language.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.430
OK.

01:14:05.430 --> 01:14:07.520
Any questions?

01:14:07.520 --> 01:14:10.920
So now, let's prove it.

01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:13.210
Let me just do it here.

01:14:13.210 --> 01:14:15.852
So now, let's prove it.

01:14:15.852 --> 01:14:18.470
I think we just have enough
time, maybe to prove it.

01:14:25.730 --> 01:14:29.554
So to prove it, let's just first
list some elementary facts.

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:37.000
First, just do some
elementary fact.

01:14:41.950 --> 01:14:51.690
First, from Lorentz
symmetry-- we

01:14:51.690 --> 01:14:53.330
do have to assume
Lorentz symmetry.

01:14:53.330 --> 01:14:54.980
OK.

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:59.650
You can show-- so this I will
just write down the answer

01:14:59.650 --> 01:15:01.160
and leave yourself to show it.

01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.106
OK?

01:15:02.106 --> 01:15:03.515
In your PSET.

01:15:06.430 --> 01:15:09.790
So if you look at the
matrix [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:09.790 --> 01:15:12.640
of this conserved current
between two such states

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:19.530
of different k, in the limit
which k goes to k prime,

01:15:19.530 --> 01:15:23.480
you have q k mu k0.

01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:50.516
And similarly, in
this limit-- so this

01:15:50.516 --> 01:15:51.640
we will do it in your PSET.

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:59.140
So let me call this
equation 2, equation 3.

01:15:59.140 --> 01:16:03.010
So this is based on the
following normalization.

01:16:05.650 --> 01:16:27.750
Based on the following
normalization between the two

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:28.250
states.

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:28.750
OK.

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:39.370
So this relation is actually
very easy to see intuitively.

01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:46.750
Yeah, you can
prove it by-- yeah,

01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:50.200
let me give me just a quick
hint for [INAUDIBLE] regarding

01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:57.150
2, is that you can first
show that k sigma J0

01:16:57.150 --> 01:17:03.290
sandwiched between the
two, in the limit when

01:17:03.290 --> 01:17:07.130
this k become the
same is just given

01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:08.820
by q divided by 2 pi cubed.

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:16.665
So this is, again,
somewhat intuitive

01:17:16.665 --> 01:17:21.860
because k is eigenstate
of Q. Because the k is

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:24.940
an eigenstate of this Q hat.

01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.990
And Q hat is just
the integral of J0.

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:30.154
It is integral of J0.

01:17:30.154 --> 01:17:32.070
And so you can imagine
on the right-hand side,

01:17:32.070 --> 01:17:34.653
there must be a Q because these
are essentially the eigenstate

01:17:34.653 --> 01:17:36.796
of the integration with J0.

01:17:36.796 --> 01:17:39.170
And then when you take into
account all these [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:42.910
functions here, and the
integral-- and the relation

01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:45.470
between the integral,
then you will naturally

01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:49.940
find the right-hand side
is just q divided by this.

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.250
So once you know this,
then you can immediately

01:17:52.250 --> 01:17:55.550
see the first [INAUDIBLE]
equation 2 there.

01:17:55.550 --> 01:17:57.520
Because at first,
there's a j mu there.

01:17:57.520 --> 01:18:00.330
Then the right-hand
side must have index mu.

01:18:00.330 --> 01:18:02.450
So the only thing can
carry index mu is the k mu.

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:04.350
There's nothing else.

01:18:04.350 --> 01:18:08.270
And also, you know
when the mu equal to 0,

01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:09.800
you should just get the q.

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:13.840
Then, downstairs we might
have a k0 to cancel them.

01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:16.400
So this relation,
in principle you

01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:19.640
can just-- just
by intuition, you

01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.950
can just-- by dimensional
analysis, [INAUDIBLE] just

01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:24.080
directly write it down.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.760
And similar in the
second relation--

01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:30.180
in the second relation,
the analog of q.

01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:33.140
So q is the charge
associated with Q hat.

01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:39.040
The analog of the q for the
stress tensor is just the k mu.

01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:45.010
So you just replace
this by k mu.

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:47.485
It just relates
to the q by k mu.

01:18:47.485 --> 01:18:50.810
Then you get the second line.

01:18:50.810 --> 01:18:53.740
Because k by k mu [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:53.740 --> 01:18:54.470
OK.

01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:59.440
So I will leave yourself
to prove this rigorously.

01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:02.670
So this is the
second observation.

01:19:02.670 --> 01:19:11.230
It said for massless
particles, which

01:19:11.230 --> 01:19:15.460
have k squared equal to 0, and
k prime squared equal to 0,

01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.170
because [INAUDIBLE] particles.

01:19:17.170 --> 01:19:21.450
So k squared and k prime
squared should be equal to 0.

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:28.120
And that means for any two
particles, a massless momentum

01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:34.230
like this, you see immediately
just by writing this down

01:19:34.230 --> 01:19:37.280
this must be smaller than 0.

01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:42.180
So this should come from
your high school physics.

01:19:42.180 --> 01:19:45.160
The k dot k prime should
be smaller than 0.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:49.560
And that means that k plus
k prime must be time-like.

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:57.110
OK, must be time-like.

01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:04.280
Because this square is
essentially given by this guy

01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.500
because k square and
k prime equal to 0.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.610
So this guy must be time-like.

01:20:08.610 --> 01:20:10.660
OK.

01:20:10.660 --> 01:20:12.570
And so that means
you can always choose

01:20:12.570 --> 01:20:17.440
a frame that the special
part of this is 0.

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:27.950
We can choose a frame k
plus k prime equal to 0.

01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:33.870
So such a frame is
just k mu, say E, 0.

01:20:33.870 --> 01:20:38.330
Say we put all of these
in the z-direction,

01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:41.470
in the 3-direction.

01:20:41.470 --> 01:20:49.700
Then you can choose k
prime k mu equal to-- OK?

01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:00.940
And this just follows.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:05.650
These two are two
[INAUDIBLE] particles.

01:21:05.650 --> 01:21:06.640
OK, good.

01:21:06.640 --> 01:21:10.610
So now, we can
almost envision this.

01:21:10.610 --> 01:21:13.240
Then, there's still a third
elementary observation

01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:16.210
we need to put here.

01:21:16.210 --> 01:21:23.880
So the third observation
which uses this formula.

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.430
So let's now take
sigma just to be j.

01:21:37.230 --> 01:21:55.972
So now, under a rotation of
theta around 3-direction--

01:21:55.972 --> 01:21:58.555
around this direction, which we
have the [INAUDIBLE] momentum.

01:21:58.555 --> 01:22:03.530
So we choose a momentum
to be in this direction.

01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:08.140
Then you should
have-- so let me call

01:22:08.140 --> 01:22:10.820
that operator to be R
theta is the rotation

01:22:10.820 --> 01:22:13.270
in the z-direction,
in the 3-direction.

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:16.260
So this operate on k, j.

01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:20.016
So let's take sigma equal to j.

01:22:20.016 --> 01:22:23.040
Take sigma equal to j.

01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:32.550
So this should be just equal
to exponential i, j theta k, j.

01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:39.270
And if this acting on k prime j.

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:47.520
So k prime have opposite
orientation as k

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:48.635
because this is minus e.

01:22:51.821 --> 01:22:54.320
And the opposite orientation
means your helicity should also

01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:56.290
change sign.

01:22:56.290 --> 01:23:02.860
So that means here should be
minus i j theta k prime, j.

01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:05.380
OK.

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.720
Yeah, because this
is the rotation

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:10.200
along the positive 3-direction.

01:23:12.981 --> 01:23:13.480
OK.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:16.250
So now we are in business.

01:23:16.250 --> 01:23:20.820
So now finally, we will try
to-- from those facts together,

01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:24.335
we will now see a contradiction.

01:23:24.335 --> 01:23:27.566
Now see a contradiction.

01:23:27.566 --> 01:23:28.941
Now you can see
that this object.

01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:40.410
Consider k, j-- k prime, j.

01:23:40.410 --> 01:23:52.107
Say this R minus 1 theta
acting on J mu R theta k, j.

01:23:52.107 --> 01:23:53.565
So now, let's
consider this object.

01:23:56.410 --> 01:24:00.090
So this object, I can
evaluate it by two ways.

01:24:00.090 --> 01:24:04.160
First, I can just act
R theta on both states.

01:24:04.160 --> 01:24:05.700
OK.

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:10.530
So R theta on this one
just gives me this.

01:24:10.530 --> 01:24:15.720
R minus 1 acting on that just
give me opposite of this.

01:24:15.720 --> 01:24:19.670
So all together,
if I do that way,

01:24:19.670 --> 01:24:29.914
then I get exponential 2 i j
theta k prime, j J mu k, j.

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:39.060
But I can also act this
operator on this current.

01:24:39.060 --> 01:24:42.950
So this current should
transform as a Lorentz vector.

01:24:42.950 --> 01:24:52.050
So if I do this way, then I
should get lambda mu new k

01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:59.880
prime, j J new k, j.

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:04.220
So these acting on that should
just effect a Lorentzian

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:05.232
summation on j.

01:25:05.232 --> 01:25:07.315
And so this is in the
Lorentzian summation matrix.

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:13.976
So lambda mu mu just is the
standard rotation matrix

01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:14.850
acting on the vector.

01:25:18.147 --> 01:25:23.340
So lambda mu mu just the
standard rotation matrix.

01:25:23.340 --> 01:25:28.170
For example, just
given by 1, 0, 0, 0.

01:25:28.170 --> 01:25:32.150
Say, cosine theta
minus sine theta.

01:25:32.150 --> 01:25:37.910
So just a rotation
along the 3-direction.

01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:47.640
So this just the
rotation acting on the j.

01:25:52.150 --> 01:26:02.320
So now similarly, if you
examine this quantity.

01:26:10.150 --> 01:26:17.340
Yeah, similarly if I just
replace here by T mu mu, OK?

01:26:17.340 --> 01:26:22.776
by T mu mu-- we are
out of time, so let me

01:26:22.776 --> 01:26:25.490
be a little bit faster now.

01:26:25.490 --> 01:26:34.600
Similarly, if we
replace that by T mu mu,

01:26:34.600 --> 01:26:42.230
then we will get the same
thing 2 i j theta k prime,

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:53.250
j T mu mu k, j, which obtained
by acting directly on k, j.

01:26:53.250 --> 01:26:57.330
By the way, that R
acting on T mu mu, then

01:26:57.330 --> 01:27:00.690
T mu mu transform as a 2 tensor.

01:27:00.690 --> 01:27:04.960
Then we should get
lambda mu rho mu lambda.

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:12.903
Lambda mu rho k prime,
j T lambda rho k, j.

01:27:23.670 --> 01:27:24.710
So now, here's the key.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.270
Now, here's the key.

01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:31.708
So do you already see
the contradiction?

01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:42.110
So let's look at this equation.

01:27:42.110 --> 01:27:43.880
This is just like a vector.

01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:47.460
The whole thing
is like a vector.

01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:48.880
The same vector.

01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:52.320
So this is like an
eigenvalue equation.

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.830
So this lambda mu mu
acting on this vector

01:27:55.830 --> 01:27:57.650
get eigenvalue 2 i j theta.

01:27:57.650 --> 01:28:01.360
So this is like an
eigenvalue equation.

01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:10.040
But if you look at
this matrix, this

01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:21.130
can only have
eigenvalue exponential

01:28:21.130 --> 01:28:25.010
plus minus i theta and the 1.

01:28:25.010 --> 01:28:28.060
So this is thing we
are familiar with.

01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:32.280
So [INAUDIBLE] minus i theta, 1.

01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:36.210
So similarly with this equation,
just you have 2 lambda, OK?

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:42.510
So now, that means
if this quantity

01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:51.360
is nonzero, which we know
it is nonzero from 2 and 3.

01:28:51.360 --> 01:28:53.440
It is nonzero.

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:57.610
That these 2 i j theta
can only take a value

01:28:57.610 --> 01:29:00.510
plus minus i theta and the 1.

01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:05.060
So that means that
j-- from here,

01:29:05.060 --> 01:29:09.730
let's say equation 4 and 5.

01:29:09.730 --> 01:29:17.130
From equation 4, that j
must be smaller than 1/2.

01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:21.160
Because there's a 2j there.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:27.080
Similarly, from equation 5,
means j must be smaller than 1.

01:29:30.640 --> 01:29:34.050
So this is what
we want to prove.

01:29:34.050 --> 01:29:35.540
So this is what
we want to prove.

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:36.040
Yes?

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:37.831
AUDIENCE: Aren't k and
k prime [INAUDIBLE]?

01:29:41.220 --> 01:29:46.484
I mean, 2 and 3, the limit k
goes to k prime and k plus k

01:29:46.484 --> 01:29:47.360
prime is 0.

01:29:47.360 --> 01:29:48.040
HONG LIU: Yeah.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:52.930
So I can take them-- if
j is greater than 1/2.

01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:56.025
For example in this relation,
if j is greater than 1/2,

01:29:56.025 --> 01:29:59.380
then the only possibility
is for this to be 0.

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.750
But we know when you take k
equal to k prime, at least

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:03.820
in that limit this is nonzero.

01:30:03.820 --> 01:30:05.400
And so this cannot be 0.

01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:08.934
So this quantity cannot
be identical to 0.

01:30:12.251 --> 01:30:12.750
OK.

01:30:15.864 --> 01:30:17.030
So this gives you the proof.

01:30:20.470 --> 01:30:23.100
So if you find the
loophole in this proof,

01:30:23.100 --> 01:30:29.470
other than they have live in
the same dimension-- yeah,

01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:32.840
that would be great.

01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.707
AUDIENCE: What is the
whole matrix element is 0?

01:30:35.707 --> 01:30:37.290
What if the whole
matrix element is 0?

01:30:37.290 --> 01:30:39.470
HONG LIU: No, the point is that
the whole matrix element cannot

01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.990
be 0.

01:30:39.990 --> 01:30:40.573
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:30:40.573 --> 01:30:41.820
HONG LIU: Because of this.

01:30:41.820 --> 01:30:43.682
AUDIENCE: Isn't the
limit k goes to k prime?

01:30:43.682 --> 01:30:45.640
And there, you assume
that k plus k prime is 0.

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:48.447
So it means both k and
k prime should be 0, no?

01:30:48.447 --> 01:30:49.280
HONG LIU: I'm sorry?

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:49.779
No.

01:30:49.779 --> 01:30:50.800
k plus k prime is not--

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:51.674
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:30:51.674 --> 01:30:53.510
HONG LIU: No, this
is a spatial vector.

01:30:53.510 --> 01:30:54.385
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:30:54.385 --> 01:30:55.970
HONG LIU: No, this
is spatial vector.

01:30:55.970 --> 01:30:58.290
No, this is spatial vector.

01:30:58.290 --> 01:30:59.630
Yeah.

01:30:59.630 --> 01:31:00.400
Yeah.

01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:01.358
This is spatial vector.

01:31:03.581 --> 01:31:04.080
OK.

01:31:04.080 --> 01:31:07.400
Sorry, I'm a little bit late.

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.000
Yeah.

01:31:08.000 --> 01:31:10.150
That's all for today.

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:06.600
PROFESSOR: How do we state
the issue of normalization?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.100
See, the spherical harmonics
are functions of theta and phi.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:16.230
So it makes sense that you would
integrate over theta and phi--

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.620
solid angle.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.210
The solid angle is the
natural integration.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.380
And it's a helpful integration,
because if you have solid angle

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500
integrals and then
radial integrals,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.630
you will have integrated
over all volume.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.080
So for this spherical
harmonic, solid angle

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.030
is the right variable.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.250
And you may remember,
if you have solid angle,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:49.380
you have to integrate
over theta and phi.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.316
Solid angle, you think
of it as a radius of one.

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:01.776
Here is sine theta.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.270
So what is solid angle?

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:14.370
It's really the area on
a sphere of radius one.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.410
The definition of
solid angle is area

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.300
over radius squared, the part of
the solid angle that you have.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.230
If you're working with
a sphere of radius one,

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.020
it's the area element
is the solid angle.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.720
So the area element in here
would be, or the integral

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.190
over solid angle--

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.040
this is solid angle, d omega--

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.800
you would integrate
from theta equals 0

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.850
to theta equals pi of
sine theta, d theta.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.535
And then you would integrate
from 0 to 2 pi of d phi.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.690
Now, you've seen that
this equation that

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.875
began as a differential equation
for functions of theta ending

00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:21.180
up being the
differential equation

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.690
for a function of cosine theta.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.580
Cosine theta was
the right variable.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.260
Well, here it is as well,
and you should always

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.880
recognize that.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.390
This is minus d of cosine theta.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:51.155
And here you would be degrading
from cosine theta equals 1

00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:55.005
to minus 1.

00:02:55.005 --> 00:02:59.310
But the minus and the order of
integration can be reversed,

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:08.530
so you have the integral from
minus 1 to 1 of d cos theta

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:17.480
and then the integral
from 0 to 2 pi of alpha.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.504
So this is the solid
angle integral.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.465
You integrate d of cosine
theta from minus 1 to 1 and 0

00:03:30.465 --> 00:03:32.485
to 2 pi of d phi.

00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:37.180
And we will many times use
this notation, the omega,

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.043
to represent that integral so
that we don't have to write it.

00:03:41.043 --> 00:03:43.690
But when we have to
write it, we technically

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.610
prefer to write it this way,
so that the integrals should

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:52.630
be doable in terms
of cosine theta.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:04:00.260
So what does this all mean
for our spherical harmonics?

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.820
Well, our spherical
harmonics turned out

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.170
to be eigenfunctions
or Hermitian operators.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.320
And if they have different
l's and m's, they

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.480
are having different
eigenvalues.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.860
So eigenfunctions of
Hermitian operators

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.350
with different eigenvalues
have to be orthogonal.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.617
So we'll write the
main property, which

00:04:32.617 --> 00:04:41.048
is the integral of
2l, say l prime, m

00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:46.030
prime, of theta and phi.

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.110
And he put the star here.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.870
I'll put the star just
at the Y, and he's

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.190
complex conjugated
the whole thing.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.660
Remember that in our problem,
one wave function was complex

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:58.990
conjugated.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.140
The other wave function
is not complex conjugated.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.880
They're different
ones because l and m

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:12.080
and l prime and m prime
could be different.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.210
So orthogonality is warranted.

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.940
Two different ones with
different l's and different m's

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.670
should give you different
values of this integral.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:35.800
So at this moment, you
should get a delta l prime l

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.290
delta m prime m.

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:46.090
And if l and m are the same
as l prime and m prime,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.470
you have the same
spherical harmonic.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.520
And all this tremendous
formula over there,

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.000
with 2l plus 1 and
all these figures,

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.820
you're guaranteed that in
that case you get 1 here.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.258
So this formula is
correct as written.

00:06:08.506 --> 00:06:12.369
That is the orthonormality
of this solution.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.710
Probably, this stage might
be a little vague for you.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:23.810
We saw this a long time ago.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.790
We may want to review
why eigenfunctions

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.900
of Hermitian operators
with different eigenvalues

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:34.862
are orthogonal and see
if you could prove.

00:06:34.862 --> 00:06:41.340
And you do it, or is it kind
of a little fuzzy already?

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:45.330
We saw it over a month ago.

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:53.230
So time to go back to
the Schrodinger equation.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:57.772
So for that, we
remember what we have.

00:06:57.772 --> 00:07:12.310
We have minus h squared over
2m Laplacian of psi plus V of r

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:17.720
psi equals E psi.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:26.560
And the Laplacian has
this form, so that we can

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.350
write it the following way--

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:47.810
minus h squared over 2m 1 over
r d second dr squared r psi--

00:07:51.532 --> 00:07:53.440
I won't close the
brackets here--

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:00.220
minus this term.

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:11.060
So I'll write it minus one
over h squared r squared l

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:21.082
squared psi plus V of r
psi is equal to E psi.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:30.405
Now, you could be a little
concerned doing operators

00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:34.380
and say, well, am I
sure this l squared

00:08:34.380 --> 00:08:38.039
is to the right
of the r squared?

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:41.640
r and l-- l has momentum.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.679
Momentum [INAUDIBLE] with r.

00:08:43.679 --> 00:08:46.590
Maybe there's a problem there.

00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:51.080
But rest assured, there
is no problem whatsoever.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:56.160
You realize that l squared was
all these things with dd phetas

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.980
and dd phis.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.435
There was no r in there.

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:00.510
It commutes with it.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.840
There is no ambiguity.

00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:08.115
We can prove directly that
l squared commutes with r,

00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:09.910
and it takes a little more work.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.490
But you've seen
what l squared is.

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:15.524
It's the dd thetas and dd phis.

00:09:15.524 --> 00:09:18.870
It just doesn't have
anything to do with it.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:21.420
So now for the great
simplification.

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:24.660
You don't want any of your
variables in this equation.

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.540
You want to elicit
to a radial equation.

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.502
So we try a factorized solution.

00:09:33.502 --> 00:09:36.090
Psi is going to be--

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:41.290
of all the correlates--
is going to be a product

00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:50.910
a purely radial wave
function of some energy E

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:57.177
times a Ylm of theta and phi.

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:06.670
And we can declare
success if we can

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:09.810
get from this
differential equation now

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.790
a radial differential
equation, just for r.

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:15.912
Forget thetas and phi.

00:10:15.912 --> 00:10:20.494
All that must have been taken
care of by the angular momentum

00:10:20.494 --> 00:10:22.390
operators.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.980
And we have hoped for that.

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:26.990
In fact, if you look at it, you
realize that we've succeeded.

00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.490
Why?

00:10:30.010 --> 00:10:34.870
The right-hand side will have
a factor of y and m untouched.

00:10:34.870 --> 00:10:39.980
V of r times psi will have
a factor of Ylm untouched.

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.330
This term, having
just r derivatives

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:48.610
will have some things acting
on this capital R and Ylm

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:49.150
untouched.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:51.590
The only problem is this one.

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:58.360
But l squared on Ylm
is a number times Ylm.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.500
It's one of our eigenstates.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:04.113
Therefore, the Y's and
m's drop out completely

00:11:04.113 --> 00:11:06.446
from this equation.

00:11:06.446 --> 00:11:09.710
And what do we get?

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:20.086
Well, you get minus h squared
over 2m 1 over r, d second,

00:11:20.086 --> 00:11:33.560
dr squared, r capital RE
minus l squared on psi lm--

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.265
or Ylm now--

00:11:36.265 --> 00:11:40.562
is h squared times
l times l plus 1.

00:11:40.562 --> 00:11:42.636
So the h squared cancels.

00:11:42.636 --> 00:11:47.125
You get l times l
plus 1 r squared,

00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:54.890
and then we get the RE
of r times the psi lm

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.670
that has already--

00:11:56.670 --> 00:11:59.531
I started to cancel it
from the whole equation.

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:08.765
So I use here that L squared
from the top blackboard

00:12:08.765 --> 00:12:13.960
over there, has that eigenvalue,
and the psi lm has dropped out.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:25.975
Then I have the V of r
RE equals E time RE of r.

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:36.900
So this is great.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:42.300
We have a simplified equation,
all the angular dependencies

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:42.960
gone.

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:48.150
I now have to solve this
equation for the radial wave

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:52.320
function and then multiply
it by a spherical harmonic.

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.060
And I got a solution
that represents

00:12:56.060 --> 00:13:01.170
a state of the system
with angular momentum l

00:13:01.170 --> 00:13:06.180
and with z component
of angular momentum m.

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:09.400
The only thing I
have to do, however,

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:15.310
is to clean up this
equation a little bit.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:21.780
And the way to clean it up is
to admit that, probably, it's

00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.510
better as an equation
for this product.

00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:35.175
So let's clean it up by
multiplying everything by r.

00:13:40.597 --> 00:13:46.245
dr squared of little r RE.

00:13:46.245 --> 00:13:49.480
If I multiplied
by r here, I will

00:13:49.480 --> 00:14:01.523
have plus h squared
over 2m l times

00:14:01.523 --> 00:14:21.020
l plus 1 over r squared
rRE plus V of r times

00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:37.310
r times RE equals E
times r times RE of r.

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:57.430
So we'll call u of r r times RE
of r, and look what we've got.

00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:00.605
We've got something
that has been adjusted,

00:15:00.605 --> 00:15:05.560
but things worked out
to look just right.

00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:12.370
Minus h squared over 2m
d second, dr squared u

00:15:12.370 --> 00:15:15.470
of r plus--

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:23.895
let me open a parentheses V
of r plus h squared over 2m r

00:15:23.895 --> 00:15:37.336
squared, l times l plus one u
of r is equal to E times u of r.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.070
Here it is.

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:51.866
It's just a nice form of a
one-dimensional Schrodinger

00:15:51.866 --> 00:15:53.300
equation.

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:59.520
The radial equation for the wave
function dependents, a long r,

00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:03.120
has become a radial
one-dimensional particle

00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:07.490
in that potential, in which
you should remember two things.

00:16:07.490 --> 00:16:12.536
That this u is not quite
the full radial dependent.

00:16:12.536 --> 00:16:17.870
The radial dependent is
RE, which is u over r.

00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:21.370
But this equation
is just very nice.

00:16:21.370 --> 00:16:26.810
And what you see is
another important thing.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:33.200
If you look at the given
particle in a potential,

00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:34.860
you have many options.

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:38.616
You can look first for the
states that have 0 angular

00:16:38.616 --> 00:16:41.310
momentum-- l equals zero--

00:16:41.310 --> 00:16:44.130
and you must solve
this equation.

00:16:44.130 --> 00:16:46.440
Then you must look
at l equals 1.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:50.225
There can be states
with l equals one.

00:16:50.225 --> 00:16:51.600
And then you must
solve it again.

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.870
And then you must solve for
l equals 2 and for l equals 3

00:16:55.870 --> 00:16:57.950
and for all values of l.

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:03.050
So actually, yes, the
three-dimensional problem

00:17:03.050 --> 00:17:07.380
is more complicated than
the one-dimensional problem,

00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:10.099
but only because, in
fact, solving a problem

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:14.890
means learning how to solve
it for all values of l.

00:17:14.890 --> 00:17:17.480
Now, you will
imagine that if you

00:17:17.480 --> 00:17:20.730
learn how to solve for one
value of l, solving for another

00:17:20.730 --> 00:17:22.069
is not that different.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:26.554
And that's roughly true, but
there's still differences.

00:17:26.554 --> 00:17:28.880
l equals 0 is the easiest thing.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.410
So if the particle is
in three dimensions

00:17:32.410 --> 00:17:35.060
but has no angular
momentum-- and remember,

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:40.546
l equals 0 means no angular
momentum-- it's this case.

00:17:40.546 --> 00:17:43.530
l equals 0 means m equals 0.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.410
l squared is 0.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.210
lz is 0.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:51.160
This is 0 angular momentum.

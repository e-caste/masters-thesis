00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:05.760
PROFESSOR: I want to demonstrate
two ways in which you

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.420
can see phase shift.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.440
So basically, the reason
we use phase shift

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.340
is that these are the things
that you can calculate.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.780
Calculating phase
shifts is possible.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.160
So how do you do that?

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.420
We'll be a two-step procedure.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.400
We'll only finish
that next time.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.080
But let's get started.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.210
So suppose you have
your wave again.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.800
And for a fixed l, a
given partial wave,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.900
this is the full solution
for this scattering problem.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.330
It is an Al Jl of kr
plus bl at Nl of kr.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.641
y l0.

00:00:51.641 --> 00:00:52.515
That's your solution.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.674
The signal that
you got scattering,

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.090
and you have
something right here,

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.110
is the existence of this
term, because when there's

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.800
no potential and no
scattering, the solution

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.590
is valid all the
way to r equals 0,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.900
and therefore, this
has no singularity.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.380
But this term is saying
that this solution

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.040
doesn't extend all
the way to r equals 0,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.490
because this diverges.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.950
So something un-trivial
is happening.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.040
So bl is the signal
that they're scattering.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.270
Now, expand for large R. So this
is proportional to Al sine kr

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:49.310
minus l pi over 2 minus bl
cosine kr minus l pi over 2

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:58.470
y l0 1 over a kr.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.090
It's the same.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.280
I'm going to drop all
constants very fast.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.500
Now, here is my claim.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.870
You were thinking
of phase shifts.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:15.552
Well, the phase shift is
nothing else than bl over Al

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:20.360
is minus the tangent
of the phase shift.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.850
This is a claim.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.660
Or you could say this is another
definition of a phase shift,

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.830
and I'm going to argue that it's
the same, actually, than what

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:31.490
we did.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.230
To do that, I have to
just expand a little more.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:46.900
So what I'm going to
do is divide by a,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.110
so take the a out, akr.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:03.790
Now you have sine kr minus l
pi over 2 minus bl over Al.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.110
Bl over Al is tangent
delta, so plus tan delta l

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.015
cosine kr minus
l pi over 2 y l0.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:32.410
And that is proportional to
a over kr tangent delta l

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.270
is sine over cosine.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.870
So let's put the 1
over cosine delta l

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:50.680
here, sine kr minus l
pi over 2 cosine delta l

00:03:50.680 --> 00:04:04.390
plus cosine kr minus l pi over
2 sine delta l y l0 of theta.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.940
So that ratio tangent, I
put a sine over cosine,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.190
I have it here.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:18.890
But this, your favorite
trigonometric identity,

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:26.900
is equal to a over kr
1 over cosine delta l

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:38.410
sine, a single sine of kr
minus l pi over 2 plus delta l.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:44.550
So if this is the phase
shift, the solution

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:50.940
looks like this far away, a
sine of kr minus l pi over 2,

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.890
plus a delta l.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.510
That's one way of
identifying the phase shift.

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:00.970
But I want to show that's the
same phase shift we had before,

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.000
but that's clear already.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.850
Up to constants, this is--

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.910
I'm sorry, y l0 of theta.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:19.440
And up to constants, this is e
to the ik r minus l pi over 2

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:29.040
plus i delta minus
e to the i minus ik

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.410
r minus l pi over
2 minus i delta.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.420
And now I drop everything else.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:49.780
And now I multiply or take
out this phase, take it out.

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.750
I'm just working up to
proportionality, which

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.650
is all you care at this moment.

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:02.250
And this is e to the i
kr minus l pi over 2.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.350
If I take that out, this
becomes plus 2i delta l.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:16.250
And this becomes minus e to the
minus i kr minus l pi over 2.

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:22.430
And those are the waves we had
before, somewhere here, here.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.790
Here they are.

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:25.450
You see them?

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.030
Still, they were here.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.830
This wave and that wave with
delta here has showed up.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.170
So this delta that
I've defined here

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:41.355
is the same phase shift
we introduced before.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:49.520
So now you have three ways
of recognizing a phase shift.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:56.460
A phase shift can be recognized
in the partial wave expansion.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.410
A phase shift can be
recognized by looking

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.550
at the scattering wave
far away and seeing

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.260
that it takes this
form, and you say,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:08.750
oh, here is the phase shift.

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:11.990
And the phase shift
can be recognized

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:16.370
by looking at the solution
in terms of spherical Bessel

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.430
functions, and it's the
ratio of these coefficients.

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.320
Those are the three definitions
of the phase shift, three ways

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:25.872
of seeing your phase shift.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.570
Instead of elaborating
more on this,

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:42.820
let's do one example
to convince you

00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:46.920
that this is solvable
and doable in fact.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.655
So the example is a
hard sphere example.

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:03.500
This is the object that
you're scattering off.

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.960
The potential is equal to
infinity for r less than a

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.780
and 0 for r greater than a.

00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:18.740
This is the origin and radius
a sphere, the waves come in.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.230
You want the cross-section.

00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:23.060
OK.

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.900
It might look like
this is hard, OK.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:28.730
How are we ever
going to solve this?

00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:32.450
In fact, will be very easy.

00:08:32.450 --> 00:08:36.929
We have everything
ready to solve.

00:08:36.929 --> 00:08:41.929
So let's remember what we have.

00:08:41.929 --> 00:08:45.740
Well, there's going to
be a radial solution,

00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:54.920
Rl Remember Rl is Ul over
R. And that takes the form

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:04.700
Al Jl of kr plus Bl Nl of kr.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.180
That is the general
solution for a radial thing,

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:13.700
and therefore your general
solution for your wave function

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:17.120
or of theta is what
we were writing here,

00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.960
except that the
superposition of them.

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.840
So I said here is
how you recognize

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.560
what is the phase shift
for a given partial wave,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.950
but we're going to have
all the partial wave.

00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:36.950
So this is going to
be the sum over l

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:45.950
of these things, Al
of Jl of kr plus Bl

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:52.430
Nl of kr times Pl of theta.

00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:57.950
I could write y l0, but
that's up to a constant Pl.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.210
So that's your general solution.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:05.930
And in fact, I didn't
even have to write this,

00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.010
because you have there on
that blackboard, that's

00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:16.980
the general solution for the
full wave away from this sphere

00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.970
that's not valid
for R less than 0.

00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:23.510
But this is your full solution
for a given partial wave

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.850
for all the waves it's there.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:30.380
OK, so that equation
solves a problem.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:32.750
pl of cosine theta, yes.

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.600
It's really better
written like that.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.630
Yes, that's more rigorous.

00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.280
Yes.

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.550
OK, so what do we do now?

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:50.000
Somehow you have to use it.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.290
You have a sphere.

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:53.090
We haven't used a sphere yet.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.040
So what does the
sphere tell you?

00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:57.890
It tells you that
the wave function

00:10:57.890 --> 00:11:03.520
must vanish on the sphere,
because it's infinitely hard.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:05.890
It's like an infinite wall.

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:10.360
So this wave function
should vanish psi

00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:16.090
at a theta, which
is equal to sum over

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:33.160
l Al Jl of ka plus Bl of Nl
of ka times Pl of cosine theta

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.640
should be 0.

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:41.670
OK.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.690
One equation for
infinitely many unknowns,

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:49.860
but the Pl's are a complete set.

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:55.740
If you expand the function of
theta in terms of Pl's, you

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.900
can determine every coefficient.

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.140
They're linearly
independent, the Pl's.

00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:05.220
So if you can think
of this, this is an a.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:07.600
This is just a number.

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.110
So this is a sum of numbers
times Pl's must be 0.

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:16.440
All the numbers must
be 0, because the Pl's

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.690
are independent.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:40.080
Therefore, here we have that
a Al Jl of ka plus Bl Nl of ka

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.830
must be 0 for all l.

00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:57.760
And therefore, tangent delta
l, which is minus Bl over Al

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.810
has been determined.

00:12:59.810 --> 00:13:07.585
The tangent delta l is Bl
over Al, and that's equal to--

00:13:10.532 --> 00:13:16.595
it's Jl of ka over Nl of ka.

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.950
Done.

00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.530
All phase shifts computed.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.240
The Bessel functions are known.

00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:29.370
You look them up.

00:13:29.370 --> 00:13:31.320
You calculate them
to any accuracy.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.290
But you have here
all the phase shifts.

00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:40.230
Therefore, you have the
cross section of this sphere.

00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:42.900
You have the differential
cross section.

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.300
You have anything you want.

00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:47.670
It has all been determined.

00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:52.890
We can do a little
bit of algebra

00:13:52.890 --> 00:13:55.860
if you want to calculate
what the sine squared

00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.530
delta of something.

00:13:58.530 --> 00:14:02.130
Sine squared can be expressed
in terms of tan squared.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:10.710
It's tan squared delta l over
1 plus tan squared delta l.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:18.915
So it's our Jl squared over
Jl squared plus Nl squared.

00:14:21.570 --> 00:14:26.380
Tan l, you substitute
this, and you get that.

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:35.730
Therefore, the cross
section can be calculated,

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:38.620
and the differential cross
section can be calculated.

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.090
It's pretty interesting.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:44.820
Let's do it here.

00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:53.070
The cross section, remember
sigma is 4 pi over k,

00:14:53.070 --> 00:15:00.360
sum over l equals 0 to
infinity 2l plus 1 times

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:02.230
this sine squared.

00:15:02.230 --> 00:15:13.620
So Jl of ka squared over
Jl squared of ka plus Nl

00:15:13.620 --> 00:15:14.890
squared of ka.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:22.330
So that's your
full cross section.

00:15:22.330 --> 00:15:31.730
If k is very small, ka much
less than 1, that's small k.

00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:37.640
That's small energy, long
wavelength approximation.

00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:41.300
This formula is interesting for
high energy, for low energy,

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.270
for intermediate energies.

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.700
The angular dependence
is interesting.

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:48.580
It's a lots of things
you could look at.

00:15:48.580 --> 00:15:52.490
Let's look at low energy.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.420
You need the expansions of this
quantities for small things,

00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.850
and they're easy to find.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:00.950
Basically, this remain finite.

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:02.390
This becomes infinite.

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.940
It dominates it.

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:09.110
It's not difficult.
I'll write what 1 gets.

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.040
It's 4 pi over k
squared, sum over l

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:18.620
equals 0 to infinity,
1 over 2 l plus 1 2

00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.460
to the l l factorial
2l factorial.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.520
So a mess of factorials.

00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:25.940
I'm sorry.

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:29.890
ka to the 4l plus 2.

00:16:29.890 --> 00:16:33.290
And here is to the
question of convergence

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:37.070
if ka is much smaller
than 1, in this case--

00:16:37.070 --> 00:16:41.200
this was the approximation--
that will sure converge.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:45.860
The powers go up and up.

00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:50.480
So for l equals 0,
it is interesting,

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:52.440
is the dominant one.

00:16:52.440 --> 00:17:01.280
So l equals 0 only sigma turns
out to be 4 pi over k squared.

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:07.599
And all these factors just
give you a 1 for l equals 0.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:15.119
The ka squared, a
squared, ka squared,

00:17:15.119 --> 00:17:20.990
which is 4 pi a squared,
which is a pretty cute answer.

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:25.380
This is the low
frequency cross section.

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.910
If it's a long wave
length approximation,

00:17:28.910 --> 00:17:34.100
the cross section of the object
is not the apparent cross

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.660
section, which is the diameter,
but it's actually the full area

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:41.060
of the sphere 4 pi a squared.

00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.240
People try to
imagine why this is.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.270
It's almost like the
wavelength is so big

00:17:47.270 --> 00:17:51.120
that the wave wraps around the
sphere and gets stuck there.

00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.420
So the sphere captures
proportional to the area

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.600
of the whole thing.

00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:01.960
So we'll see more
of that next time.

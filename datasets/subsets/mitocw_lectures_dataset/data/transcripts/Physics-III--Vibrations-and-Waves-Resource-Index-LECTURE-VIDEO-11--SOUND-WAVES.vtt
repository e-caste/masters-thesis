YEN-JIE LEE: So welcome
back again to 8.03.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.045
Today, my plan is to continue
the discussion of the two

00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:38.100
string system, which we were
working really hard last time

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.210
but we sort of run out of time.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.830
So we didn't have time to
enjoy what we have done, right?

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.560
So today we are going to
discuss all the outcome

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.270
of that calculation.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.970
And so we will start to discuss
more examples which can be

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.180
described by the wave equation.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.950
Today we are going to talk
about another example, which

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.099
is sound waves.

00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:06.300
It's a very exciting topic.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.350
And afterwards, we will
start the discussion

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.965
about electromagnetic waves.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.640
So this is the wave equation
which we have been using,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.970
and over the last
few lectures, we

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.150
have been discussing two
specials kinds of solutions--

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.960
the normal modes,
which is actually

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.710
standing waves in the
end, which we identified,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.930
and the progressing
wave solution, which

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.010
is very powerful in
describing the phenomena which

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.160
we are familiar with.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.650
Last time, in the
end of the lecture,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.370
we were discussing about
an interesting example,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:51.210
which involves two
strings in the system.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.440
One essentially in the left-hand
side have mass per unit length,

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.720
rho l equals to rho 1, and
right-hand side one is thicker,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.070
and therefore, the mass
per unit length, rho,

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.199
is larger, which
is called rho 2.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:11.450
What we did last
time is to assume

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.260
that we have a progressing
wave, which essentially

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.220
going into this--

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.240
which essentially first
initiated in the left-hand side

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.510
string and it's going towards
the boundary of the two

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.040
systems--

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.220
the more massive one and
the less massive one.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.590
And see what is going to happen.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.100
And what we actually tried
to describe last time

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.660
is that we actually define
incident wave described

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.130
by this fi function,
transmitting wave, ft,

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.290
and the refractive wave, fr.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.310
By using boundary conditions
which we described last time

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.860
we can conclude
that there's a fixed

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:09.270
relation between the three
waves equation-- wave functions.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.090
What we actually
concluded that last time

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.240
is that fr is proportional to
fi, which is the incident wave

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.610
function, by some constant,
which is called r.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.280
And what is r?

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.900
As we solved last time, it's
V2 minus V1 over V1 plus V2,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.250
which are the velocities of
the first and second string.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.290
And the transmitted wave, ft,
is actually also proportional

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.950
to the incident wave.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.950
And the coefficient--
we call it tau--

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.050
to describe the amplitude
of the transmitted wave.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.900
So what we can do
is the variance.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.820
So we actually discussed
two examples last time,

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.820
plugging in V1 and V2.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.820
And there are two more
examples we can actually

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.110
make use of this equation we
obtained last time to discuss

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.540
what would be the
physics outcome

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.290
of this kind of situation.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.750
So the first example which
we can actually discuss

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.460
is that, OK, now I
have this string.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:31.190
Assume, though, they're
connected to a wall.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.530
So this time we can say,
oh, wait, wait, wait, wait

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:34.030
a second.

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.960
There's only one
string now, right?

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.570
But last time we were
solving two strings, right?

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.310
But what I'm doing now
is to treat the wall

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.300
as if it's a string.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.720
But this wall is really massive.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:54.080
Therefore, the rho l, or
the mass per unit length,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.410
is really large.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.910
OK.

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.540
It goes to infinity.

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.570
If that's the case, if
you're set this idea--

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:06.990
this is still a
two string system--

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:09.200
then I can now go
ahead and calculate

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:11.510
what will be the velocity.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:17.240
The velocity V2 goes to 0.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.340
Then I can go ahead and
plug into my equations.

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.610
So we spend a lot of
time in the last lecture

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.650
to obtain those equations.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.900
And we will find that
if I have V2 goes to 0,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.560
I have r equal to minus 1.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.400
And the tau, which
is actually related

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.010
to the amplitude of
the transmitted wave,

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.070
is equal to 0, which you
can see from this equation.

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:48.590
What does that mean?

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.890
That means once we
solve that question,

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.800
we also know what would be the
outcome of this experiment,

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.090
this physical situation.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.390
When we have a string
attached to a wall

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:06.920
and we have an incident wave,
as a function of time, what

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.370
is going to happen afterward
is that this wave is

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.930
going to propagate and
hit the wall and get

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.210
refracted completely.

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:21.230
The amplitude ratio is minus 1.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:25.280
Therefore, all the
energy is refracted

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.800
by the wall in this highly
idealized situation.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.150
So that's kind of interesting.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.440
The second example is
also very interesting.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.740
So if you have a string
attached to a massive ring,

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:51.850
and this ring can go up and down
freely without any friction,

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:55.750
you can again say, no, no, no,
this is again a single string

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.040
system, right?

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.490
But what I'm going to
argue now is that, OK,

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:05.680
there's another string which is
so light mass per unit length

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:09.340
is close to 0.

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.000
So it is actually in the air.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.150
If I do that, what
is going to happen?

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:21.790
The rho l is going to
go to the limit of 0,

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:27.070
because the right-hand side
you almost cannot see it.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:31.300
And the V2, which
is the velocity

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:36.130
of the transmitted
wave, goes to infinity.

00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:38.300
If that's the case,
you can then again,

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.930
plugging into this equation
we obtained, and then

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:46.030
you conclude that r
would be equal to 1

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:50.270
and tau will be equal to 2.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.590
So what does that mean?

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.600
This means that if you
have this end, which

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.230
is the open end,
attached to a ring which

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:04.740
can move up and down, then
you get that refraction.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.280
The amplitude of
the refractive wave

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.950
doesn't change, because
i is equal to 1.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:16.980
So it's still in the positive
direction we defined.

00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:19.060
But now, it goes backward.

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.700
Again, all the energy
is actually refracted,

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.000
as you can see
from this equation.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.370
But the curious case is that--

00:08:27.370 --> 00:08:33.350
the strangest thing is
that the tau is equal to 2.

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.159
That's kind of strange, right?

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:37.347
Tau is equal to 2.

00:08:37.347 --> 00:08:38.180
What does that mean?

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:43.840
That means you are going to
predict a transmitted wave

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.250
with amplitude exactly the
two times the incident wave,

00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:52.390
and it's going to be propagating
in the right-hand side

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:55.180
and the speed goes to infinity.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:08:59.070
What does that mean?

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.650
Does that mean the
energy is not conserved?

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:07.660
Have we found the cure
of the energy crisis?

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:12.530
Because now-- I can actually
take all those energy.

00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.480
I can design this thing,
and then this thing

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.290
will bounce around
all over the place.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:20.180
And that is going
to emit energy.

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.550
Oh my god, we solve
all the problem.

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.650
You should be really
excited about it, right?

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:28.430
No?

00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:33.430
But unfortunately,
rho l goes to 0.

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:38.540
So there's actually nothing
oscillating out of this system.

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:43.100
So therefore, there is no
additional energy radiated out

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.360
of this system.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.290
Too bad.

00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:48.530
Go back to work.

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:49.520
All right.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.220
So that's actually what
we discussed last time,

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.920
and I hope that
complete the loop.

00:09:54.920 --> 00:10:00.800
And today, before we
actually move to sound wave,

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.000
I would like to talk
about, very briefly,

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.060
harmonic progressing waves.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.580
So now, we can see that harmonic
progressing wave looks really

00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:15.740
beautiful, as you can see here.

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:23.820
And it can be described by a
cosine kx minus omega t plus 5.

00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.600
5 is actually the face.

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.620
And you can always write
it in different forms.

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.770
And since we have
learned how to describe

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.670
in general the progressing
wave, this is just to remind you

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.880
that, OK, there's
no proper notion

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.800
to describe a harmonic
progressing wave.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:52.520
So since we have
learned about waves,

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.160
which involve oscillation
in the transverse direction.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.540
So basically, we
always say, OK, things

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:05.000
are oscillating up and
down in the case of string.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.990
Before I start, though,
the sound wave, there's

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:12.830
a different kind of wave
which we can also see

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.480
very often in the daily life.

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.220
This is called
longitudinal waves.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:25.100
For example, I can have a spring
wave, and I can actually--

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.890
imagine I have a spring wave.

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:28.220
And I can do this.

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:31.250
I oscillate in the
horizontal direction.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:37.100
Then that can produce
displacement with respect

00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.200
to the equilibrium position.

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.970
And this kind of behavior
is like a density wave.

00:11:43.970 --> 00:11:46.253
We call it longitudinal waves.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:53.640
This is exactly what is
happening with sound wave.

00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.180
So what is actually sound wave?

00:11:55.180 --> 00:12:00.830
Essentially, a collection
or motion of air molecules.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:04.350
And they are actually
oscillating back and forth.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:11.840
And we may use that to extend
energy all over the place.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:15.560
And today we are going to
discuss the sound wave.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.950
And by the way,
just for simplicity,

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:24.500
because drawing all those dots
really take a lot of time.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:27.470
So what we sometimes
do is that, OK,

00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:32.150
we can now draw the pressure,
the amplitude of the pressure,

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.260
or the amplitude
of the displacement

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:39.770
of individual molecules
in the discussion

00:12:39.770 --> 00:12:40.800
as a function of time.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:45.190
So if we draw the amplitude
as a function of time

00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:49.310
or as a function of
location, then it

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.830
looks exactly the same as
what we discussed before

00:12:52.830 --> 00:12:56.600
for the transverse waves.

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.550
So just some clarification.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:02.370
It's not like the molecules
are going up and down.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.810
They are going back and
forth, and it's just a matter

00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:08.270
presenting that these are.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:12.010
So this is actually an
example of a travelling wave

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:14.250
in the longitudinal direction.

00:13:14.250 --> 00:13:16.470
And you can see
that it is actually

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:20.970
the density which is actually
changing as a function of time.

00:13:20.970 --> 00:13:23.450
And as you can
see, it's actually

00:13:23.450 --> 00:13:29.410
traveling at a fixed speed and
going in the right direction

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:33.460
of the blackboard.

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:38.110
So those being said,
we can actually

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:41.780
get started with a
concrete example.

00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:46.400
So I would like to discuss
with you now a system,

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:53.676
which is like you have a tube,
with cross section area, A.

00:13:53.676 --> 00:13:58.850
So A is actually the area
of the cross section.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.850
And I can now wonder--

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:07.550
now the physics question I'm
asking is, what would be the--

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:14.700
what would be the behavior
of the air inside this tube?

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.730
So before I go ahead
and solve this problem,

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:21.450
I need to define and give
you some more information

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:26.580
about this tube and also the
condition or the environment

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.050
this tube is living in.

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:32.220
So the first information
I would like to give you

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:38.080
is that the pressure,
the room pressure,

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.100
is actually P0 in this example.

00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:44.970
So the P0 is actually
the room pressure.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:51.600
And I can now define coordinates
is the x direction is actually

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:53.910
in the horizontal
direction pointing

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:56.280
to the right-hand side.

00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:03.630
And now, I can actually try to
describe a small unit volume

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:09.150
inside the tube by location x.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:15.180
And the width of this
volume, I call it delta x.

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:23.092
And if I go ahead and prepare
this system and at time, t,

00:15:23.092 --> 00:15:25.890
something is happening
to this system--

00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:29.960
so now, you need length.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.210
You need volume,
I was discussing.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:38.150
This get displaced with respect
to the equilibrium position.

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:40.730
So that means, assuming
that something happened

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:46.210
at the t equal to t, the left
inside edge of the volume

00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:50.760
is shifted toward a positive
direction, which is described

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:54.540
by wave function psi x.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.510
And the position of
the right-hand side

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:06.240
edge of this volume is shifted
to side x plus delta x.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.750
So something happened
to this system.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:12.570
We can also say
that-- we can also

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:16.230
describe this system, the
pressure of this system,

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:18.030
by P function.

00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:22.230
P of x is actually
equal to P0, which

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:25.860
is actually room pressure--

00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.190
P0 is the baseline
room pressure--

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:39.500
plus some kind of displacement
in pressure, psi P.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:45.010
So now we describe the pressure
acting on the left inside edge

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:49.470
of the small unit volume,
and the right-hand side,

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:52.000
you can also do the same thing.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:59.530
P of x plus delta x will
be equal to P0 plus psi P,

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:02.450
describing the
displacement or how

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:07.300
offset the pressure is as a
function of x but now evaluated

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.780
at x plus delta x.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:17.329
So once we have all of
those elements defined--

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:19.000
these are essentially
just a copy

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.280
of what I have in the slide
and those are a reminder here--

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:30.310
now, we can actually calculate
the motion of all the molecules

00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:38.670
in this volume, because I have
pressure, I have displacement.

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:41.770
The displacement is
described by psi,

00:17:41.770 --> 00:17:45.880
end position is described by
psi, the change in pressure

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:50.260
is described by psi P. And
now I can go ahead and apply,

00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.270
for example, Newton's law.

00:17:52.270 --> 00:17:54.070
Then I can calculate
what would be

00:17:54.070 --> 00:18:02.830
the acceleration for all the
molecules inside this volume.

00:18:02.830 --> 00:18:05.320
But wait a second.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.260
That sounds all great,
but I don't know yet

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:13.040
how to relate pressure
and the volume,

00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.790
because pressure is
actually expressed by psi P

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:20.510
and the volume is
related to psi.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:25.070
I need to know is actually
the relation between pressure

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:28.190
and the displacement
or pressure between psi

00:18:28.190 --> 00:18:30.650
so that I can make progress.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:33.830
So that this actually the
main discussion which I would

00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:37.610
like to do in this lecture.

00:18:37.610 --> 00:18:41.970
So given those
information, I can now

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:47.540
calculate what is actually the
change in this little volume.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:55.190
So I can calculate
the change in volume,

00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:00.380
which is described by
delta V. But delta V

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:05.180
can be actually calculated
by a, which is actually

00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.700
the area of the
cross section, times

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:19.970
psi x plus delta
xt minus psi xt.

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:27.620
So basically, just calculate how
much the boundary is actually

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:28.850
displaced.

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:35.630
And if we always take very
small amplitude approximation,

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:39.500
then basically
this expression is

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:47.870
roughly equal to A partial
psi partial x times delta x,

00:19:47.870 --> 00:19:50.990
where the delta x is
really very small.

00:19:50.990 --> 00:19:55.280
So a very small volume
I was talking about.

00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:59.165
And I can also
calculate the pressure.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.990
What is the pressure difference?

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.620
The pressure difference
is between the pressure

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:14.280
acting in the left-hand side
edge and the pressure which

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.380
is acting on the
right-hand side edge.

00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.090
So I can now calculate
pressure difference,

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:32.500
delta P. Delta P would be minus
psi P x plus delta x t plus psi

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.230
P x t.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.740
So basically, one is
essentially the pressure

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.030
pushing the body in
the right-hand side.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:45.530
The other one
essentially pushing it

00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:47.950
in the left-hand side direction.

00:20:47.950 --> 00:20:52.504
Again, I can take very
small delta x approximation.

00:20:52.504 --> 00:20:54.170
And basically, what
you are going to get

00:20:54.170 --> 00:21:00.360
is minus partial psi
P partial x delta x.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.910
So we have prepared all
of those information

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:11.020
about volume and the pressure.

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.540
As I mentioned before,
the big question

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:17.380
which we would like
to ask is, how do I

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:23.110
relate pressure and the volume
so that I can make progress?

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.530
If I can relate
pressure and volume,

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:28.990
then I can know
what is the relation

00:21:28.990 --> 00:21:32.290
between psi P and the psi.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.260
Then I can ask you to
make use of Newton's Law.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:40.870
Then I can calculate the
resulting equation of motion.

00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:46.900
So there's two possible
interesting scenarios

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:50.530
which we can relate
temperature-- so sorry,

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:53.380
relate pressure and the volume.

00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:58.870
The first one was
proposed by Newton.

00:21:58.870 --> 00:22:05.060
Newton said that, OK, this
is an interesting phenomena.

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.820
In my opinion, although
you actually displaced

00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:12.820
this volume--

00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:19.780
make the displacement for
those molecules in the tube--

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:23.620
but because the heat was
conducted from one region

00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.510
to the other region,
all those regions

00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:27.840
are connected to each other.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:34.460
And the speed of this
heat transfer is so fast.

00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:37.400
It's really fast, like instant.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:42.670
This heat is actually
transferred from one direction

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:43.360
to the other--

00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:46.530
one position to
the other position.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:55.030
Therefore, over the
course of this evolution,

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.040
the temperature
should be unchanged.

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.610
No matter what you do to
the air inside the tube,

00:23:03.610 --> 00:23:05.500
the temperature
should be unchanged,

00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:11.860
because Newton thinks
that heat should be--

00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:13.725
the speed of the
heat distribution

00:23:13.725 --> 00:23:15.880
is really, really fast.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.550
Much faster than
all those vibration

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:21.760
happening in the tube.

00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:25.270
If that is the case--

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.050
that is the case--

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:36.300
then that means we
can use ideal gas law.

00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.825
P times V is equal to nRT.

00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:56.570
I hope that you have learned
this before in 8.01 and 8.02.

00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.750
If that's the case, that means--

00:23:58.750 --> 00:24:00.890
so all those things
are constant,

00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:05.770
because we assume that
temperature is unchanged.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:17.080
Therefore, the right-hand side
is essentially a constant.

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:23.290
Therefore, P times V would
be some kind of constant.

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:32.710
The V would be
proportional to 1/P.

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:35.320
So that essentially
is the first idea,

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.390
which is coming from
Newton, in order

00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:43.450
to relate pressure
and the volume.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.120
The second idea is
coming from Laplace.

00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:56.350
Laplace says, OK, he
has a different opinion

00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:58.210
on this matter.

00:24:58.210 --> 00:25:04.570
He think that this essentially
is an adiabatic process.

00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:06.210
What does that mean?

00:25:06.210 --> 00:25:12.220
That means the heat flow
from the compressed region

00:25:12.220 --> 00:25:17.430
to the other region
is really negligible,

00:25:17.430 --> 00:25:20.190
because the oscillation
is really fast

00:25:20.190 --> 00:25:24.980
and the speed of the
transfer of the heat

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:30.330
is really slow compared to the
time scale of the oscillation.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:35.970
Therefore, in
Laplace's opinion, he

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:40.485
thinks that the whole
process is adiabatic process.

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:55.150
If that's the case, which
I will show you later,

00:25:55.150 --> 00:26:01.490
that means you have this
relation between pressure

00:26:01.490 --> 00:26:02.580
and the volume.

00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:05.890
P times V to the gamma.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:09.140
Gamma essentially
related to the decrease

00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:13.650
of freedom of the molecule,
which we will discuss later

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:15.910
in the class.

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:19.615
This would be equal to constant.

00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:27.490
So the very interesting
thing of this lecture

00:26:27.490 --> 00:26:33.460
is that we are going to be able
to test which one is correct.

00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.930
You will be able to see if
Newton win or Laplace win.

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:44.080
So as I mentioned
before, one is assuming

00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:49.540
the heat transfer, the speed
of the heat propagation,

00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:54.490
is really, really much larger
than the speed of oscillation.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:57.010
The other viewpoint
from Laplace is

00:26:57.010 --> 00:27:01.420
that the heat flow is
actually really negligible

00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.350
compared to the oscillation
we are talking about here.

00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:09.340
And now, as usual, I would
like to have a vote now.

00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:15.910
How many of you
support Newton's idea?

00:27:15.910 --> 00:27:22.716
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11--

00:27:30.020 --> 00:27:34.604
so 15 of you vote for Newton.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:42.060
How many of you saying
Laplace is correct?

00:28:01.990 --> 00:28:04.950
How about the others?

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:06.390
OK, very good.

00:28:06.390 --> 00:28:12.510
So we have a majority of you
support the idea of Laplace,

00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:15.550
and some of you
actually support Newton.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:19.590
And we are going to see what is
going to happen in the lecture

00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.510
today.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:26.160
So let's go ahead and
apply these two ideas.

00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.730
So PV gamma equal to constant.

00:28:29.730 --> 00:28:34.760
So in the case if ideal gas
law, gamma is equal to 1.

00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.927
Therefore, I just have to work
on these function of form.

00:28:37.927 --> 00:28:39.510
And then also later
we will figure out

00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:43.500
what is gamma all together.

00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:48.360
So that's consider
only small vibration.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:56.940
Small vibration means--
small vibration means

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:01.170
that I have psi P,
which essentially,

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:07.470
from this definition,
psi P is the change

00:29:07.470 --> 00:29:12.840
in pressure with respect
to the room pressure, P0.

00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:18.060
So psi P, assuming that's
much, much smaller than P0.

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:27.810
And also, I assume that the
changing volume, delta V, which

00:29:27.810 --> 00:29:30.870
I calculated there,
is much, much smaller

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:36.600
than P0, which is essentially
the original volume

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:42.050
of this little area--

00:29:42.050 --> 00:29:48.420
original volume of this
area I was working here.

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.260
All right.

00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:51.055
So that's the two assumption.

00:29:54.660 --> 00:30:00.920
Before I change the position of
the boundary, which essentially

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:09.340
is the upper graph, if I change
anything, I have P0 V0 gamma.

00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:17.310
This is equal to some constant,
C. And gamma can be equal to 1

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:19.900
so that you have ideal gas law.

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:28.530
After the vibration
initially happened,

00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:34.470
after the wall's initially
displaced from the equilibrium

00:30:34.470 --> 00:30:38.110
position, what I'm
going to get is--

00:30:38.110 --> 00:30:47.910
I will have P plus delta P times
V0 plus delta V to the gamma.

00:30:47.910 --> 00:30:56.080
This is equal to C.

00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.120
So based on those,
actually I have already

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:14.650
calculated delta P and delta V.
So in this case, this delta P

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:17.190
should be--

00:31:17.190 --> 00:31:19.040
OK, this is actually
not the delta P

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:23.020
I was talking about there, so
I should change it to delta P.

00:31:23.020 --> 00:31:27.120
Because that's,
essentially, the difference

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:31.440
between the resulting pressure
and the original pressure.

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.416
It's not the difference between
the left-hand side pressure

00:31:34.416 --> 00:31:35.790
and the right-hand
side pressure,

00:31:35.790 --> 00:31:39.180
which essentially
is showing there.

00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:43.960
So this delta P, which
I have already defined,

00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:49.190
essentially called
psi P. Therefore, I

00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:59.120
will derive this
to be P plus psi P.

00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:04.130
And I can now also copy these.

00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:08.150
You are going to get V0
plus delta V to the gamma.

00:32:08.150 --> 00:32:12.160
And this is equal to C.

00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:17.470
So as I mentioned before, I'm
considering small vibration.

00:32:17.470 --> 00:32:21.880
Delta V is much,
much smaller than V0.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:27.875
Therefore, this expression
can be written as P--

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.040
sorry, this should be P0.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:36.100
I'm making some mistake here.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:44.160
This expression should be
written as P0 plus psi P.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.810
V0 to the gamma.

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:58.620
1 plus gamma delta V over
V0, because delta V is much,

00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.120
much smarter than V0.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.360
Can everybody follow?

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:11.510
So here I will already take
small vibration approximation.

00:33:11.510 --> 00:33:15.440
And basically, I can
now rewrite this thing.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.570
I just expend all those terms.

00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:22.400
Basically, I call this
equation number two.

00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:36.406
Equation number two will become
P0 V0 gamma plus gamma delta V

00:33:36.406 --> 00:33:48.850
V0 gamma to the minus
1 P0 plus psi P V0

00:33:48.850 --> 00:34:04.130
to the gamma plus gamma delta V
psi P V0 to the gamma minus 1.

00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:05.580
So there's no magic.

00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.870
Essentially, it's just
expanding these terms.

00:34:08.870 --> 00:34:11.750
Then, basically, you are
going to get four terms.

00:34:11.750 --> 00:34:18.020
And basically, if you do
write down the equation number

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:20.190
two especially,
that is essentially

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:21.320
what you are going to get.

00:34:24.199 --> 00:34:27.620
So we are making
progress, and we

00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:30.139
would like to simplify things.

00:34:30.139 --> 00:34:34.090
And you can quickly
identify the hardest term,

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:36.230
P0 V0 to the gamma.

00:34:36.230 --> 00:34:38.389
I know what is the
value of that, right?

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:42.350
That essentially is
the original situation,

00:34:42.350 --> 00:34:52.000
and that is
essentially equal to C.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:56.409
Let's take a look
at also this term.

00:34:56.409 --> 00:35:00.010
This term is
proportional to what?

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:05.590
Proportional to delta V, which
is a very small quantity,

00:35:05.590 --> 00:35:12.400
and proportional to psi P, which
is another very small quantity.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:17.540
Therefore, taking a small
vibration approximation,

00:35:17.540 --> 00:35:19.960
I would just simply
ignore this term.

00:35:22.590 --> 00:35:24.920
Is everybody following?

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:26.270
All right.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:29.080
So this term, this
original term,

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.580
is equal to C based
on this expression.

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:38.540
So we start from the system
before the vibration happened.

00:35:38.540 --> 00:35:42.380
After the vibration happened
there's a change in pressure,

00:35:42.380 --> 00:35:49.880
there's a change in delta
V. But if you multiply PV

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:53.680
to the gamma, this
expression is still

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.240
equal to C, some
kind of constant.

00:35:56.240 --> 00:36:02.060
And then, now I do small
vibration approximation,

00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.990
and I drop the term which
is actually proportional

00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:10.730
to delta V times psi P.
And basically what I get

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:17.760
is that C is equal to
C plus gamma delta P V0

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:23.510
gamma minus 1 P0 plus
psi P V0 to the gamma.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:32.890
This term, these two
constants cancel.

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:36.940
And now, I can actually
move one of the terms

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.280
to the left-hand side.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:40.620
Then basically, what
I am going to get

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:48.700
is psi P V0 to the gamma would
be equal to minus gamma delta V

00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.670
gamma 0 gamma to the--

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:59.260
V0 to the gamma
minus 1 times P0.

00:36:59.260 --> 00:37:02.935
We can't immediately
cancel V0 to the gamma.

00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:09.000
Therefore, what are
we going to get?

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:18.195
I'm getting psi P would be
equal to minus gamma P0 over V0

00:37:18.195 --> 00:37:26.002
delta V. Everybody following?

00:37:33.410 --> 00:37:35.300
So this is essentially
the expression.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:38.220
And we also know
why essentially is

00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:42.470
delta V. Based on
this expression,

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:48.920
delta V is essentially A
partial psi partial x delta x,

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:52.310
if we look at the upper
board, which we actually just

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:54.620
derived a moment ago.

00:37:54.620 --> 00:38:00.580
Therefore, I can write, replace
delta V by that expression.

00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:05.090
Then basically what I get
is psi P would be equal

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:15.396
to minus gamma P0 A delta
x divided by V0 partial psi

00:38:15.396 --> 00:38:17.180
partial x.

00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:21.360
I'm just plugging in the
expression for delta V

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.930
to that equation.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:25.460
A lot of mathematics,
but all of them

00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.740
should be pretty
straightforward.

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.890
You don't actually have to
copy because all of them

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.440
are in the lecture note.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.810
OK?

00:38:32.810 --> 00:38:34.010
All right.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:36.800
So here, you can
see I can, again,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:39.620
simplify this expression.

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:44.210
A is actually the cross
section of the tube,

00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:48.470
and delta x is the width
in the x direction.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:53.400
So A times delta x is just V0.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:55.070
Oh, very good!

00:38:55.070 --> 00:39:00.040
I get this very simple
expression, minus gamma P0

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.776
partial psi partial x.

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:09.920
So we have achieved our goal
to simplify the expression

00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:15.050
and to find the relation
between psi P and the psi.

00:39:15.050 --> 00:39:19.660
That's actually what originally
we were hoping to do,

00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:22.340
and we have achieved that.

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:26.080
And I call it equation
number three here.

00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:29.590
Don't forget what is
psi and psi P. Psi

00:39:29.590 --> 00:39:34.270
P is the amount of
change in pressure,

00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:39.400
and the psi is the amount of
displacement of the wall--

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.120
of the molecule in the volume.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:50.460
So now, I'm really
close to my solution,

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:55.170
because now I can now
calculate the force acting

00:39:55.170 --> 00:39:58.260
on this little
volume, because now I

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.860
know what is the pressure.

00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.250
So what is the F total?

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.700
The F total is
essentially delta P,

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:11.760
which is the
difference in pressure

00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:15.011
from the left-hand side end
compared to the right-hand side

00:40:15.011 --> 00:40:15.510
end.

00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:17.705
So that's what we
calculated before.

00:40:20.640 --> 00:40:30.240
Now this, A partial psi
P partial x delta x.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.625
We also know what
would be the mass.

00:40:35.820 --> 00:40:41.300
We know that the little mass
in this volume, delta m,

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:49.100
will be equal to rho, which
is the density of the air,

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:53.970
times A, which is the cross
section, times delta x.

00:40:53.970 --> 00:40:59.130
That will give you
the little area, V0.

00:40:59.130 --> 00:41:05.640
So rho times A times delta
x will be your delta m.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:08.370
We are almost there.

00:41:08.370 --> 00:41:12.750
I have the m, I have the
force, what kind of law

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:15.782
do I need to use to get
my equation of motion?

00:41:15.782 --> 00:41:16.740
AUDIENCE: Newton's law.

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:18.360
YEN-JIE LEE:
Newton's law, right?

00:41:18.360 --> 00:41:20.100
Newton's law.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:23.670
So F is equal to
m times a, right?

00:41:23.670 --> 00:41:26.950
So therefore, I
can now calculate

00:41:26.950 --> 00:41:33.400
and essentially I can now plug
in rho times A times delta x.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:34.780
What is A?

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.630
A is essentially psi double-dot.

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:42.630
That's essentially describing
the displacement with respect

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.420
to the equilibrium position.

00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:53.400
And now I know this is equal to
force, which is A times delta x

00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:57.056
partial psi P partial x.

00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.680
And you can see that both
ends you have a delta x.

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:07.960
So I can cancel that.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.140
Both ends you have an A,
so now I can cancel that.

00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:15.130
Then basically you get
rho psi double-prime.

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:20.240
This is equal to
partial psi P partial x.

00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:26.755
From the beginning we're talking
about the relation between psi

00:42:26.755 --> 00:42:32.430
P, the displacement in
pressure, and psi, how much

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:35.430
the molecules are displaced.

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:38.460
And then we have
the solution here.

00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:41.550
If you assume the
relation which was

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:46.230
given by Newton or by
Laplace, basically, you

00:42:46.230 --> 00:42:53.490
can conclude that this
would be equal to gamma

00:42:53.490 --> 00:43:00.370
P0 partial square psi
P partial x square.

00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:11.490
All right.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:14.220
And I can now put
all the constants

00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.300
to the right-hand side.

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:24.880
Basically, what you get
is psi double-prime.

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.640
So here it should be partial
square psi partial x square,

00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:33.500
because I replaced psi P by psi.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:36.230
And I must miss one--

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:39.320
I must miss one
negative sign somewhere.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:40.220
AUDIENCE: Over there.

00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:40.670
YEN-JIE LEE: Where?

00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:41.570
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:41.570 --> 00:43:43.320
YEN-JIE LEE: Oh,
this essentially--

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:44.736
there's a minus
sign there, right?

00:43:44.736 --> 00:43:49.692
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
On the left side.

00:43:49.692 --> 00:43:51.150
YEN-JIE LEE: On
the left-hand side.

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:51.450
Yeah.

00:43:51.450 --> 00:43:51.790
That's right.

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:52.498
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

00:43:52.498 --> 00:43:55.020
There should be A. That's wrong.

00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.630
YEN-JIE LEE: Yes, you are right.

00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:00.010
And the minus sign
should belong there.

00:44:00.010 --> 00:44:02.870
So that actually--
sorry for that.

00:44:02.870 --> 00:44:06.700
So there should be
a minus sign here.

00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:08.840
And there should be
a minus sign here.

00:44:08.840 --> 00:44:12.790
And after I plug in
equation number three,

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:16.900
then I get psi double-prime
equal to gamma P0

00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.730
over rho partial square
psi partial x square.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:24.620
Any other problems you find?

00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.080
Not yet?

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.270
OK.

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:30.700
So look at this equation.

00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:31.390
Oh my god!

00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:32.710
What is this equation?

00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:34.300
AUDIENCE: Wave.

00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:37.000
YEN-JIE LEE: Wave equation.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.500
Again.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:39.040
Again.

00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.010
Wave equation.

00:44:42.010 --> 00:44:43.810
You can say that, huh,
I'm not surprised,

00:44:43.810 --> 00:44:48.930
because this system
is used so many times.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:50.530
I have learned
this so many times,

00:44:50.530 --> 00:44:53.200
but I am still
surprised that this

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:57.970
is so identical to
the physics which

00:44:57.970 --> 00:45:02.160
we have been studying
for the strings

00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:07.030
for over the few lectures.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:08.710
So that's very nice.

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:12.550
And now, the question
we have an answer

00:45:12.550 --> 00:45:17.230
is that, OK, what
essentially is gamma?

00:45:17.230 --> 00:45:20.090
What is essentially gamma?

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:26.960
So gamma, in the case of
the adiabatic process,

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:33.260
gamma is actually equals to
alpha plus 1 minus alpha.

00:45:33.260 --> 00:45:39.620
And alpha is related to the
number of degrees of freedom.

00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:43.190
So if you haven't
done this before,

00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:47.870
I have a concrete proof
of the adiabatic process.

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:51.890
And this is actually
coming from the first law

00:45:51.890 --> 00:45:54.660
of thermodynamics.

00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.650
And basically, you will
be able to conclude

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:02.645
that gamma will be equal to
alpha plus 1 divided by alpha.

00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:07.220
The value of alpha--

00:46:07.220 --> 00:46:11.090
the value you get
for alpha is related

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:15.680
to how many degrees of
freedom you can actually

00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:17.930
have in this system.

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:28.700
For example, if I have a system
which is made of atomic gas--

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:33.140
so there's only one
atom in a molecule--

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:36.530
and basically you have
3 degrees of freedom.

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:40.160
So you can move this thing
in the horizontal direction.

00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:45.130
You can move this atom upside
down or back and forth.

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:48.920
So there are three
degrees of freedom.

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:54.860
And if you calculate alpha,
that will give you 3/2.

00:46:54.860 --> 00:46:59.240
And basically, if you calculate
gamma according to the equation

00:46:59.240 --> 00:47:03.620
you are going to get 1.67.

00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:08.470
On the other hand, if
you have atomic gas,

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:12.740
that means you have
more degrees of freedom.

00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:15.320
So basically, you have
not only the translation

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:16.940
of degrees of freedom--

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:23.270
the three ones which are
identical to the atomic gas--

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:27.000
you can also have two
rotational degrees of freedom.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.540
So you can have these two
atoms rotating like this,

00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:37.030
you can have that
rotating like that.

00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:41.330
The trickiest thing is this one
vibration degree of freedom,

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:46.460
as you learned from the
couple equations before.

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:52.070
But this one, very trickily,
is not excited at all

00:47:52.070 --> 00:47:52.880
at low temperature.

00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:55.640
You have to go to really,
really super high temperature

00:47:55.640 --> 00:48:03.470
so that this actually contribute
to the overall degrees

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:04.380
of freedom.

00:48:04.380 --> 00:48:08.410
So therefore, you have a
total of available degrees

00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:10.010
of freedom of 5.

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:17.140
And if you calculate the gamma,
you basically will get 1.4.

00:48:17.140 --> 00:48:22.610
So let's now
calculate what will be

00:48:22.610 --> 00:48:28.145
the resulting speed of light.

00:48:28.145 --> 00:48:29.010
Sorry, no.

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:30.140
Not speed of light.

00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:38.890
The speed of sound So if the
temperature remain unchanged,

00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:44.380
if you take this equation
here, this is a wave equation.

00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:51.050
Therefore, I know how to
calculate the speed of sound.

00:48:51.050 --> 00:48:54.340
The speed of sound
will be equal to--

00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.790
P will be equal
to the square root

00:48:56.790 --> 00:49:02.200
of gamma P0 divided by rho.

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:09.160
So I have figured out the rho
and the room pressure for you.

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:17.290
So the P0 will be 10 to
5 kilogram ms squared,

00:49:17.290 --> 00:49:20.950
and the rho will
be equal to 1.2.

00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:24.480
Rho is actually the
density of the air.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:29.890
It's essentially 1.2
kilogram per meter cubed.

00:49:29.890 --> 00:49:38.230
If I have a gamma equal to 1,
which is the case for ideal gas

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:43.300
law temperature unchanged,
if I calculate the resulting

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:46.090
speed of sound you are
going to get something

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:51.590
like 389 meters per second.

00:49:51.590 --> 00:49:55.060
So that's the
prediction for Newton.

00:49:55.060 --> 00:50:02.960
And the second
case, if we have--

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:06.100
if we are believing what
Laplace actually said,

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.980
the heat flow is really,
really negligible

00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:12.340
compared with the
speed of oscillation,

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:17.410
then we have, as we
discussed last slide,

00:50:17.410 --> 00:50:20.140
gamma would be equal to 1.4.

00:50:20.140 --> 00:50:23.710
Therefore, you would be able
to calculate the resulting

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:29.650
speed of sound, and
that is actually 342.

00:50:29.650 --> 00:50:31.650
So those are the predictions.

00:50:31.650 --> 00:50:35.770
And what I'm going to do
now is to really demonstrate

00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:43.420
that we can actually measure the
speed of sound in front of you.

00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:49.210
So the first thing
which I will need to do

00:50:49.210 --> 00:50:54.510
is to switch so that
you can see the camera.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:59.860
And now, I have a set up here.

00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:03.980
Basically, this set up
is like the following.

00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:08.000
So basically, very similar
to the setup we have here.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.580
But at one end, we
actually have a speaker

00:51:12.580 --> 00:51:15.440
which produced sound wave.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.200
So this is essentially
what we have.

00:51:21.950 --> 00:51:29.280
This is the tube,
and we have, one end,

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:37.150
there's a speaker attached to
here, produce a sound wave.

00:51:37.150 --> 00:51:41.190
And basically, the amplitude
will look like this.

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:47.350
So basically, this will create
some kind of standing wave

00:51:47.350 --> 00:51:49.660
inside the tube.

00:51:49.660 --> 00:51:55.320
And I have another device,
which is actually a microphone.

00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:00.280
A microphone is connected
to this scope, which shows

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.450
you the amplitude of the--

00:52:04.450 --> 00:52:09.100
basically, the amplitude
measured by this microphone.

00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:14.890
And you see that if I move
this, as a function of position

00:52:14.890 --> 00:52:17.770
you see that the am is changing.

00:52:17.770 --> 00:52:25.360
It's getting smaller when it is
actually hitting the note here,

00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:31.920
because here there's almost
no oscillation in the air.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:37.250
Therefore, you will
measure a very small signal

00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:39.590
at that position.

00:52:39.590 --> 00:52:42.100
And if you continue
to move, then you

00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:45.740
can see that, aha, I
move away from the note,

00:52:45.740 --> 00:52:48.890
therefore I see
some kind of maxima.

00:52:48.890 --> 00:52:54.870
Then, I see that this
amplitude is dropping again.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:59.520
If I continue-- if I continue,
then say that, aha, again,

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:06.700
this amplitude is increasing
to a very large value.

00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:12.710
Then it decreases to a
minima around the note.

00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:16.340
So what I going to
do now is to measure

00:53:16.340 --> 00:53:20.040
the distance between notes.

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:26.930
And since the sound waves, which
I actually put into the system,

00:53:26.930 --> 00:53:31.580
have a frequency of--

00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:32.720
let me see.

00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.010
The frequency I put in--

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:39.120
the frequency I put in
is actually 1 kilohertz.

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:48.070
With the location of the note,
I can know what will be, what?

00:53:48.070 --> 00:53:52.820
What will be the wavelengths
of the sound waves.

00:53:52.820 --> 00:53:56.120
So therefore, I can now
measure the distance

00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.750
between those three notes.

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:03.830
Then I would be able to
measure the wavelengths.

00:54:03.830 --> 00:54:08.450
Then I would be able to
know who is correct--

00:54:08.450 --> 00:54:14.570
if Newton is correct
or Laplace is correct.

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:16.580
So let's do that.

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:20.360
So let me find the first minima.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:25.920
So the first minima
is around 64.

00:54:25.920 --> 00:54:29.690
64 centimeter.

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:31.640
And you can see that.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:37.130
Say stop when you see that
it's reaching the minima again.

00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:46.610
Stop.

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.320
OK, very good.

00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.630
So this is actually the
first note, the location

00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:53.210
of the first note,
and I was trying

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:55.760
to find the next note
so that I can actually

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.560
readout the wavelengths.

00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.770
Now, this will increase again.

00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:10.600
And reach-- stop?

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.180
Is that a stop sign?

00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:14.090
OK, very good.

00:55:14.090 --> 00:55:15.290
All right.

00:55:15.290 --> 00:55:24.860
So I get the value, which
is actually 30 centimeter.

00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.200
So now I can calculate
what would be the lambda.

00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:31.880
The lambda is
actually 64 minus 30.

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:35.040
Then, what I get
is 34 centimeters.

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:46.070
And if I calculate the velocity
of the sound wave, then

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:51.530
basically I have F times
lambda, and that will give you--

00:55:51.530 --> 00:55:55.820
this is actually equal
to 0.34 centimeter.

00:55:55.820 --> 00:56:00.920
So that would give you
340 meters per second.

00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:01.500
Oh my god.

00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:07.056
This is so close to the
prediction of Laplace.

00:56:07.056 --> 00:56:08.960
First of all, this is amazing.

00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:09.560
Why?

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:13.490
Because with this looks
really crappy thing,

00:56:13.490 --> 00:56:19.360
I can measure speed of sound.

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:23.980
Secondly, ooh, the
measurement is really great.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.870
It match within 1%.

00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:30.290
You guys did a good
job of stopping me.

00:56:30.290 --> 00:56:32.360
Very nice.

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:38.860
And finally, very unfortunately,
people who voted for Newton

00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:40.520
is wrong.

00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:43.220
So what happened
is the following.

00:56:45.884 --> 00:56:49.850
What happened is
that Newton actually

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:54.680
assumed that the speed of
propagation of the heat

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:59.210
is really fast, but
actually that's not true.

00:56:59.210 --> 00:57:03.130
Because, for example, I'm
standing here and heating up

00:57:03.130 --> 00:57:05.600
the air.

00:57:05.600 --> 00:57:09.590
In the last few lecture,
I even heat up the air

00:57:09.590 --> 00:57:13.412
by some kind of fire
in front of you.

00:57:13.412 --> 00:57:14.870
But you don't feel
the heat, right?

00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:18.320
So the heat propagation is
really not really, really fast

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.560
compared to the
speed of vibration.

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.440
The vibration is really
quick, because it's really

00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:31.100
vibrating up and down
1,000 times per second.

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:35.950
So that means what is
actually much more reasonable

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:43.160
is to describe this process
is adiabatic process.

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.080
So we will take a
five minute break

00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:47.390
here so that we
can take questions,

00:57:47.390 --> 00:57:50.730
and then we'll come
back at the 39.

00:58:03.590 --> 00:58:06.800
So welcome back, everybody.

00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:12.170
So we can see that
from the last--

00:58:12.170 --> 00:58:15.980
so from the discussion
we had before the break,

00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:22.070
we see that the sound wave can
be described by something which

00:58:22.070 --> 00:58:24.230
we are now very familiar with--

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:26.430
the wave equation.

00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:32.600
And also, we know what is the
speed of the sound, which,

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:36.290
based on this wave
equation, the speed of sound

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:44.990
is actually equal to square
root of gamma P0 over rho.

00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:51.840
So gamma is actually
obtained from this discussion

00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:56.750
of how many degrees
of freedom we have.

00:58:56.750 --> 00:58:59.150
So the first case
we discussed is,

00:58:59.150 --> 00:59:04.060
if you have a single atom
of which you make your air,

00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:10.790
then basically the gamma
is actually higher.

00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:15.800
On the other hand, if
you have diatomic gas,

00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.590
then the gamma is
actually slightly smaller.

00:59:18.590 --> 00:59:22.520
It's 1.4.

00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:29.990
So what would happen if I
change the air in my lung

00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:35.990
to monatomic atom?

00:59:35.990 --> 00:59:39.050
So what is going to happen
is that the speed of sound

00:59:39.050 --> 00:59:41.870
is going to be increased.

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:43.910
The speed of sound
will increase.

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:46.730
And I have a fixed
sized of lung.

00:59:46.730 --> 00:59:49.250
I didn't increase
the size of my lung.

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:53.525
Therefore, the frequency
of my sound will what?

00:59:53.525 --> 00:59:56.320
Will increase.

00:59:56.320 --> 00:59:59.880
So how about we do that
experiment and see if it works?

00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:07.520
So here, I have a balloon
here, which is full of helium.

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:09.080
Let me see if it works.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.740
I'm not sure if it will
work, but let's see.

01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.040
Fingers crossed.

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:16.580
We'll see what happens.

01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:21.050
Now I'm going to do a
measure of operation

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:25.190
to replace all the air
in my lung by this.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.126
Does my sound change?

01:00:51.126 --> 01:00:51.625
[LAUGHTER]

01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:53.450
No?

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:55.171
Didn't work.

01:00:55.171 --> 01:00:56.270
Let me do that again.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.140
I speak more aggressive.

01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:10.230
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:11.275 --> 01:01:13.501
Did you hear any difference?

01:01:13.501 --> 01:01:14.000
No.

01:01:20.318 --> 01:01:21.786
(HIGH PITCHED) Any difference?

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.120
Works?

01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:26.660
Works now?

01:01:29.270 --> 01:01:30.797
Very good.

01:01:30.797 --> 01:01:31.880
Maybe we should use some--

01:01:36.260 --> 01:01:38.402
maybe we should use
that sound to go over

01:01:38.402 --> 01:01:39.360
all the lecture, right?

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.450
It's a very
dangerous experiment,

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:47.600
because you are replacing
all the air in your lung.

01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.505
So you may choke.

01:01:51.290 --> 01:01:55.894
Fortunately, I survived this
experiment and hope you enjoy.

01:01:55.894 --> 01:01:58.738
[APPLAUSE]

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.240
What happened is the following.

01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:13.460
So basically-- basically,
the gamma becomes large.

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:17.400
Therefore, the speed of sound
in my lung becomes large.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:21.110
Therefore, the
frequency of my sound

01:02:21.110 --> 01:02:24.590
increased and you hear
some really strange sound.

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:25.640
OK, very good.

01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:29.870
So before the end,
I would like--

01:02:29.870 --> 01:02:31.750
poor Newton.

01:02:31.750 --> 01:02:35.870
Before the end, I would like
to discuss with you something

01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:40.620
which I hope I would not
see again in the exam

01:02:40.620 --> 01:02:42.650
but I saw before.

01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:49.640
So if I create a progressing
wave in a single--

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:56.540
in a closed end, open end
tube, this progressing wave

01:02:56.540 --> 01:03:00.068
is going to be propagating
at the speed of what?

01:03:00.068 --> 01:03:01.490
The speed of what?

01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:02.170
AUDIENCE: Sound.

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:03.170
YEN-JIE LEE: Sound, yes.

01:03:03.170 --> 01:03:06.380
It's going to be propagating
at the speed of sound,

01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:08.525
and you would
reach the boundary.

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.356
The question is,
will we see this?

01:03:16.356 --> 01:03:23.880
Would this progressing wave just
simply leak out of the tube.

01:03:26.910 --> 01:03:28.965
How many of you think
that's going to happen?

01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:35.330
I hope I will never see
that again in the exam.

01:03:35.330 --> 01:03:36.415
This would never happen.

01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:40.620
Why?

01:03:40.620 --> 01:03:49.370
That means you will have a super
narrow collimated progressing

01:03:49.370 --> 01:03:52.370
wave going straight
out of a tube,

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:58.110
and that will not actually
match the boundary conditions

01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:00.500
at the end of the tube.

01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:03.740
So that means,
basically, first of all,

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:08.190
there was no refraction.

01:04:08.190 --> 01:04:12.470
That means that all the
energy is transferred

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:14.370
outside of the world.

01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:18.190
And according to what
we discussed before,

01:04:18.190 --> 01:04:21.420
what you would expect is
that, OK, now you suddenly

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:29.040
change to environment which you
have really very large volume.

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.240
Therefore, you it will be
very difficult to change

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:36.410
the pressure
outside of the tube.

01:04:36.410 --> 01:04:38.160
Because what you are
actually connected to

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:43.470
is a reserve of infinite
number of molecules outside.

01:04:43.470 --> 01:04:48.320
It's going to be really
hard to change the pressure.

01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:51.300
Therefore, apparently
this behavior

01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:53.850
doesn't match the
boundary condition.

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:57.000
And therefore, what
you should expect

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:02.530
is something like this,
which I can show you here.

01:05:02.530 --> 01:05:06.220
So in this case, you
have both side opened.

01:05:06.220 --> 01:05:10.540
What is going to happen is that
at the boundary-- actually,

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:14.530
it's like the case
of hitting a wall,

01:05:14.530 --> 01:05:19.000
because outside of the
tube you have really,

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.600
really large volume, huge
amount of air out of it.

01:05:23.600 --> 01:05:26.680
Therefore, it's
like hitting a wall.

01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.590
The amplitude of
the progressing wave

01:05:29.590 --> 01:05:34.030
changes sine and goes
back through the tube.

01:05:34.030 --> 01:05:37.070
And of course, this system
is actually not perfect.

01:05:37.070 --> 01:05:41.590
Therefore, there can
be some leaking out--

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:46.390
some energy leak out of
the tube, which essentially

01:05:46.390 --> 01:05:50.320
must be happening, because
we can actually roll the tube

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:52.000
and we can hear the sound.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.210
That is because some
of the sound wave

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:56.110
actually leaks out of the tube.

01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:59.530
And this process will
go over and over again.

01:05:59.530 --> 01:06:02.290
And this progressing
wave is going

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:06.850
to be going back and
forth, like that.

01:06:06.850 --> 01:06:11.730
So I hope that after this
demonstration everybody

01:06:11.730 --> 01:06:15.136
will expect that, OK,
this will be not--

01:06:15.136 --> 01:06:21.370
the result will be like
this progressing wave

01:06:21.370 --> 01:06:25.900
is going to be reflected because
of the boundary condition

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:29.768
and also change sine
in terms of amplitude.

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:37.280
So what we have learned today--

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:39.930
so it's already
close to the end.

01:06:39.930 --> 01:06:46.390
We have learned example
of a longitudinal wave

01:06:46.390 --> 01:06:49.790
And basically, longitudinal
wave is actually

01:06:49.790 --> 01:06:54.140
in the form of density
wave in the example

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.940
which we covered today.

01:06:55.940 --> 01:07:00.080
And the mathematical
description of the sound wave

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:03.350
is going to be almost
identical to what

01:07:03.350 --> 01:07:09.170
we have learned from the
string case, which we actually

01:07:09.170 --> 01:07:13.370
discussed last time.

01:07:13.370 --> 01:07:15.770
There are two
boundary conditions

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:20.330
which I would like to
briefly discuss before we

01:07:20.330 --> 01:07:23.310
end the lecture today.

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:32.380
So in the case of open end,
as we discussed before,

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.750
we can have a system
which contains

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:40.400
a closed end and an open end.

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.900
What will be the boundary
condition for a closed end?

01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.080
So the closed end
have a wall here.

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:52.438
Therefore, when you
have your molecule,

01:07:52.438 --> 01:07:55.540
the air molecule
oscillating back and forth,

01:07:55.540 --> 01:08:02.590
when they are actually close to
the wall, they cannot vibrate.

01:08:02.590 --> 01:08:03.090
Why?

01:08:03.090 --> 01:08:04.790
Because it's hitting the wall.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:07.420
It cannot vibrate
so that actually,

01:08:07.420 --> 01:08:11.010
the boundary condition
at the closed end,

01:08:11.010 --> 01:08:17.279
where you have a wall closing
the tube, is psi equal to 0.

01:08:20.790 --> 01:08:25.370
And on the other hand,
if you have an open end--

01:08:25.370 --> 01:08:32.520
if you have an open end, that
means outside of the tube

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.770
the pressure is equal to what?

01:08:34.770 --> 01:08:36.460
It's equal to P0.

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:39.300
The room pressure.

01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:42.250
And you have so
many stuff there.

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:46.260
Therefore, it's not
possible to actually change

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:52.020
the pressure dramatically
at the edge of the open end.

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:54.050
Therefore, what will
be the condition?

01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:59.910
Psi P. Psi P is again the
displacement with respect

01:08:59.910 --> 01:09:00.840
to the room.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.189
Pressure will be equal to 0.

01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:09.810
Based on what we
actually have learned

01:09:09.810 --> 01:09:16.060
from this expression-- sorry
for that, my finger slipped.

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:24.410
From this expression, psi P is
equal to minus gamma P0 d psi

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:32.800
dx So psi P is proportional
to partial psi partial x.

01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:38.240
Therefore, this
boundary condition

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:45.000
actually translates to partial
psi partial x equal to 0.

01:09:47.609 --> 01:09:52.260
So this issue looks
really familiar to you,

01:09:52.260 --> 01:09:56.480
because in terms of psi, if
you forget about this system,

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:59.940
what those boundary
conditions mean to you

01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:04.140
is exactly the same
as you have some kind

01:10:04.140 --> 01:10:09.450
of a wall in the left-hand side
and it's connected to a string,

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:11.090
and the right-hand
side of the string

01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:15.030
is connected to a massless
ring which can actually

01:10:15.030 --> 01:10:17.140
move up and down.

01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.780
These two systems,
if you actually

01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:23.430
don't look at the detail--

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:28.620
only look at the wave functions
and the boundary conditions--

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.950
they are identical.

01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:35.250
So that's actually the first
lesson we learn from here.

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:39.330
So when I talk about
sound wave or when

01:10:39.330 --> 01:10:41.910
you think about
sound wave problem,

01:10:41.910 --> 01:10:44.760
there's nothing to
be afraid of anymore,

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.760
because that's actually the
same as what we have learned

01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:52.050
with wall and a string system.

01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:54.090
That's the first
thing we learned.

01:10:54.090 --> 01:11:00.660
Secondly, that only works
when I write my wave function

01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:03.390
in the form of psi.

01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:08.180
So now I can actually
get the first normal mode

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:11.965
would be like this if I
plot psi as a function of x.

01:11:11.965 --> 01:11:13.570
The second normal mode--

01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:16.600
doesn't surprise you--
will look like this,

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.830
et cetera, et cetera.

01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:22.330
If I plot psi--

01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:25.810
if I plot psi as
a function of x.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.110
On the other hand, we
also know that psi P

01:11:35.110 --> 01:11:41.950
is proportional to d psi
partial psi partial x.

01:11:41.950 --> 01:11:50.370
Therefore, you can also plot
psi P as a function of x.

01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:54.720
Then what you are going to
get is something like this.

01:11:54.720 --> 01:12:01.870
In the closed end, the psi P is
actually reaching the maxima,

01:12:01.870 --> 01:12:03.640
because it's got the wall.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:06.980
Therefore, it can
actually produce pressure

01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:08.080
on top of the wall.

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:13.090
But you cannot move the position
of all of those molecules

01:12:13.090 --> 01:12:14.650
in front of the wall.

01:12:14.650 --> 01:12:16.230
Therefore, that makes sense.

01:12:16.230 --> 01:12:20.110
You will see exactly in
the opposite direction,

01:12:20.110 --> 01:12:25.360
if you plot the amplitude
as a function of x,

01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.870
you see a picture which
is almost like flipped.

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:32.800
Of course, you can also do the
same thing for the second one.

01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:35.920
And basically, what you are
going to get is something like.

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:39.880
The second normal mode,
et cetera, et cetera.

01:12:39.880 --> 01:12:46.930
So be careful about the
matching between the boundary

01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:53.020
condition obtained from the
tube and string-wall system.

01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:54.430
They are identical.

01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:56.830
Open corresponds
responds to open,

01:12:56.830 --> 01:13:00.160
closed corresponds to
closed when you express

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.060
your equation of
motion in terms of psi.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:07.390
On the other hand, if
you change that to psi P,

01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:10.200
then the relation
is actually flipped.

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.450
Thank you very much, and I hope
you enjoyed the lecture today.

01:13:13.450 --> 01:13:16.920
And I will see you next week.

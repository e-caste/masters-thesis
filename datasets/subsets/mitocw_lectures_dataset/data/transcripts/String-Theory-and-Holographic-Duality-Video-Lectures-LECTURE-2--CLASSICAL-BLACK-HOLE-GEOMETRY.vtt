00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.380
PROFESSOR: OK, let us start.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.200
So let me first remind you
what we did in last lecture.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:43.910
We proved-- we showed that the
Weinberg-Witten theorem for

00:00:43.910 --> 00:01:01.445
beats existence of
massless spin-2 particles.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.770
Massless spin-2 particles
are hallmark of gravity,

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.160
so that's why we look for them.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:26.310
In the same-- so emphasize
in the same space time,

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.560
say a QFT lives.

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.850
So this theorem
essentially cites this.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.470
You will never have
emergent gravity start

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.355
from a [INAUDIBLE] quantum
field theory, which is

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:47.750
a well-defined stress tensor.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.300
So as we already
mentioned, it's a new pole

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:11.520
of this theorem is that actually
emergent gravity can actually

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.330
live in a different space time.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.170
So as in a holographic duality.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.630
In fact, in holographic
duality the gravity

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.860
lives in one dimension
higher, but we are not

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.240
ready to go there yet.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.900
So in order to
describe this thing

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.930
we still need to do
some preparations.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.870
So the preparations-- let me
just outline the preparations

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.660
we need to do.

00:03:17.292 --> 00:03:19.750
So the first thing we will do
is black hole thermodynamics.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.290
So these will give
hint for something

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:49.620
called the holographic
principle, which is actually

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.610
more general than the
holographic duality discovered

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:54.110
so far.

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.010
And the second thing
is, we will also quickly

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.500
go over the large
N gauge theory--

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.745
the properties of the
large N gauge theories.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:27.075
So this give hints-- something
called a gauge string duality.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.670
So the behavior of the
large N gauge theory

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.840
give you a strong hint
that actually there's

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.950
a string theory description
for ordinary gauge theories.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.550
OK, and then when you combine
these two things together,

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.890
then you get what
we have currently,

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.290
the holographic duality.

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:02.120
And then we will also talk a
little bit of sting theory.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.320
A tiny bit.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:08.040
Not a lot, so don't be scared.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.100
So we also will talk a little
bit about string theory.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.410
So in principle, actually, I can
talk about holographic duality

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.130
right now, but going
over those aspect

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:23.450
can help you to build
some intuitions,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:29.030
and also to have a broader
perspective than just

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:33.370
presenting the duality directly.

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.090
So before I start
today's lecture,

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.530
do you have any questions
regarding our last lecture

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:46.800
and regarding this-- yeah,
general remarks here?

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.370
Yes?

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.828
AUDIENCE: So moving
forward, are we

00:05:48.828 --> 00:05:51.000
going to define emergent
gravity as this existence

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.470
of a massless spin-2 particle?

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.037
PROFESSOR: No, that
we will not do.

00:05:55.037 --> 00:05:57.120
AUDIENCE: So how are we
defining emergent gravity?

00:05:59.717 --> 00:06:01.300
PROFESSOR: You
construct Newton's Law?

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:04.860
Yeah, you will see it.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.890
You will see it when we have it.

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:12.470
Yeah, essentially you
see-- essentially it's

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.580
handed over to you.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.015
You don't have to go
through that step.

00:06:16.015 --> 00:06:19.650
You don't have to go
through that step.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.150
Yeah.

00:06:24.402 --> 00:06:25.235
Any other questions?

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.540
OK, good, let's start with
black hole thermodynamics.

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.640
So let me start by
doing a little bit

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:08.580
of dimensional analysis, just
to remind you important scales

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:09.285
for the gravity.

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.360
So the first thing is what
we called the Planck scale.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:43.890
So in nature we have
fundamental constant H-bar,

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:49.030
Newton constant, and
the C, speed of light.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:57.050
And immediately after Planck
himself introduced this H-bar,

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:00.740
he realized you can actually
combine the three of them

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:09.605
to come up with a map scale,
which is just hc divided by GN.

00:08:09.605 --> 00:08:12.830
And this, if you plug in the
expressed numerical value,

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:20.160
it's about 1.2 to the 10, to the
19 gev, divided by c squared.

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.080
You can also write it in terms
of the gram, which is about 2.2

00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.940
10 to the minus 5 gram.

00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:32.440
And then you can also
have-- we can also

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:41.390
construct the length scale,
which is hGN divide c cubed,

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.110
which is about 1.6 to 10
the minus 33 centimeter.

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:57.170
And tp equals lp
divided by c, OK?

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:06.590
So this was discovered--
Planck introduced them

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:12.270
in 1899, so most of
you may know the story.

00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:15.170
And then, just immediately
after he introduced H-bar-- so

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:18.990
he introduced H-bar in 1899.

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:25.110
In the same year he realized you
can write down those numbers.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:28.930
And of course, those
numbers meant nothing to him

00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:34.070
because at that time he didn't
know special relativity,

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.410
he didn't know quantum
mechanics-- essentially,

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.960
he didn't know anything.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:49.460
But he famously said
that this unit-- so he

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.300
claimed those should be
basic units of physics,

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.980
and he also said these
are the units that

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:01.740
would retain their significance
for all times and all cultures.

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:10.125
He even said they even
will apply to aliens.

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:21.310
But only after 50 years--
so after 1950s people

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:22.260
get some sense.

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.530
So many years after
special relativity,

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.790
many years after
general relativity,

00:10:27.790 --> 00:10:30.460
and also quantum mechanics,
et cetera, people

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:35.700
started grasping the
meaning of those scales.

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:38.630
And so let me
briefly review them.

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.750
So you can-- OK, the feeling
of the meaning of those scales

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:50.740
by looking at the
strength of gravity.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:54.981
So let me first start this
example for electromagnetism,

00:10:54.981 --> 00:10:57.340
which you have a
potential, which

00:10:57.340 --> 00:11:00.940
is e squared divided by r.

00:11:00.940 --> 00:11:04.150
So if you have two charged
particle of charge e,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.360
then the potential between
them is e squared divided by r.

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:14.424
And then for particle
of mass m then

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:15.840
you also have
Compton wavelengths.

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:23.194
So if you have a
particle with mass m,

00:11:23.194 --> 00:11:24.610
you also have
Compton wavelengths.

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:26.120
It's H-bar divided my mc.

00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:37.630
So you can get rough
measure of the strength

00:11:37.630 --> 00:11:40.850
of electromagnetism--
the actual strength

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.940
of the electromagnetism
by conceiving

00:11:45.940 --> 00:11:49.980
the following [INAUDIBLE]
dimension number, which

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:56.780
I call lambda e, which is
the potential evaluated

00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.600
at the minimal-- in
quantum mechanics,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.570
essentially this is the minimal
distance you can make sense of.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:05.570
Because once you go
distance smaller than these,

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.770
you can no longer-- and
then the quantum uncertainty

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.500
will create the energy
uncertainty bigger than m,

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:17.680
and you can no longer
talk about single particle

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:19.280
in a sensible way.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.260
So the essentially
the minimal length

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.160
scale you can talk
about single particles.

00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:29.160
So this is essentially
some energy scale.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.880
So you can compare these to
the, say, the static mass

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.360
of the particle.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.990
So this give you a
measure of the strength

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:39.670
of electromagnetism.

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:42.470
Of course, if you
plug this in you

00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:46.000
just get e squared
divided by H-bar c.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.150
And of course, we know this is
the fine structure constant,

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:54.680
which is indeed the coupling.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:13:01.670
Say you would do-- indeed,
it's a coupling in QED, OK?

00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:04.777
So you can do the same
thing for gravity.

00:13:04.777 --> 00:13:06.360
You can do the same
thing for gravity.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:26.905
So for gravity we have
essentially g, and say

00:13:26.905 --> 00:13:28.550
if you take two
particle of masses

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:34.720
m then the potential between
them is gm, m squared,

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.120
divided by r.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:40.750
And then again, you can
define effective strength

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:42.130
for the gravity.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:46.090
I evaluate this potential
at Compton wavelengths

00:13:46.090 --> 00:13:51.890
divided by the static
energy of the particle.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.570
And then you can
just plug this in.

00:13:54.570 --> 00:14:01.350
So this is GN m squared,
divided by H-bar, divided by mc,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:06.430
then divided by mc squared.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:16.970
And then you find this is just
equal to GN m squared, divided

00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:20.020
by H-bar c.

00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:27.490
OK, so now if you compare
with this equation--

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:32.280
OK, so this is just given by m
squared divided by mp squared.

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:40.590
OK, so for gravity
this effective strength

00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:44.460
is just given by the
mass of the particle.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:45.880
So because for
gravity the mass is

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.730
like some kind of
effective charge,

00:14:47.730 --> 00:14:49.810
and then divided
by Planck scale--

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.050
this Planck mass-- squared.

00:14:52.050 --> 00:15:06.190
OK, and you can also write
it as lp squared divided

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:12.970
by rc squared, or just
as this Planck length

00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:16.740
divided by [INAUDIBLE]
wavelengths of this particle.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:23.350
OK, so for most
elementary particles--

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.380
so for typical
elementary particles

00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:30.570
we know the m is always
much smaller than mp.

00:15:30.570 --> 00:15:37.270
And then the lambda g would be
typically much smaller than 1.

00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:44.500
So for example, say, if
you can see the electron,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.540
the electron mass
would be 5 to the 10

00:15:48.540 --> 00:15:53.870
to the minus 4 gev
divided by c squared.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:57.690
Of course this is much
smaller than this Planck mass.

00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:00.860
And then you find that
this ratio-- so you

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.140
can work out this ratio.

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:06.110
So let's compare it to
the corresponding strength

00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:08.070
for electromagnetism.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:14.730
So this is about 10 to the
minus 43 if you work this out.

00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:16.720
So this tells you the
gravity's really weak.

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:27.690
So for ordinary
elementary particles--

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.420
so the gravity is
really weak, and so we

00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:38.070
can forget all about gravity
until you reach the Planck

00:16:38.070 --> 00:16:41.620
mass, or your
Compton wavelengths

00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:44.110
reach the Planck length.

00:16:44.110 --> 00:16:49.815
And then the fact of the quantum
gravity will be important.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:57.540
So from this exercise we know
that the mp is the energy

00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:06.380
scale, that the effective
gravity strength become

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:16.740
of order one-- become of order
one-- that is, quantum gravity

00:17:16.740 --> 00:17:25.606
fact becomes significant.

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:45.474
And similarly-- so lp is the
corresponding length scale

00:17:45.474 --> 00:17:46.640
associated with such energy.

00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:59.360
So this give you a
heuristic feeling--

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:02.730
give you a heuristic
indication that the meaning

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:05.020
of those Planck scales.

00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:11.570
OK, so there's another important
scale associated with gravity.

00:18:11.570 --> 00:18:12.800
So any questions on this?

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.380
Good, there's another important
scale associated with gravity.

00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:34.650
It's called Schwarzschild
radius-- Schwarzschild radius.

00:18:34.650 --> 00:18:37.320
So just from
dimensional analysis,

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.070
the Schwarzschild radius
can be argued as follows.

00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:43.360
So can see that--
again, we can just even

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.000
see from Newtonian gravity.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:54.490
So I would say let's consider
the object of mass m.

00:18:59.450 --> 00:19:09.170
Then we ask is the
distance-- at what distance,

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:26.420
maybe I should-- at
what distance from it

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.110
the classical gravity
becomes strong.

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.240
So for this purpose,
let's consider,

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:53.680
say, a probe mass--
say, m prime.

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:54.865
So, can see the probe mass.

00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:04.910
So I define a scale
which I call rs,

00:20:04.910 --> 00:20:09.760
as I require the potential
energy between m and m prime.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.900
at such a scale rs, then
this become of order,

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:21.550
say again, the static energy
of this probe political,

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.390
or of this probe mass.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:26.830
So if you cancel
things out then you

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:35.280
find rs is of order GNm
divided by c squared.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:46.780
OK, so this give you--
I'll give you a scale.

00:20:46.780 --> 00:20:51.350
You can also ask-- so this
is from Newtonian gravity.

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:55.730
Of course, when your
gravity becomes strong

00:20:55.730 --> 00:20:58.090
you should replace
the Newtonian gravity

00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:01.530
by Einstein, the relativity.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:05.960
And then when you
go to relativity--

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.040
when you go to relativity,
general relativity,

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:14.170
then you find then there's
a Schwarzschild radius.

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:16.070
So there's a
Schwarzschild radius

00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:22.130
which given by 2 gm divided by
c squared, which corresponding

00:21:22.130 --> 00:21:23.710
to the sides of a black hole.

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:35.040
OK, corresponding to the
sides of a black hole.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.570
So this is a classical scale--
purely classical scale.

00:21:37.570 --> 00:21:39.390
Just the scale which
the classical gravity

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:42.270
becomes strong.

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:53.350
In particular, rs
can be considered

00:21:53.350 --> 00:22:20.040
as the minimal length scale one
can probe an object of mass m,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.870
OK?

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:28.140
So classically, black
hole absorb everything.

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:31.330
So once you fall into black
hole you can never come back.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:34.910
And so the minimal
distance you can

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:39.820
approach an object of mass m,
it is given by the Schwarzschild

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:40.654
radius.

00:22:40.654 --> 00:22:42.570
So when you go inside
the Schwarzschild radius

00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.186
we just fall into
the black hole,

00:22:44.186 --> 00:22:45.810
and you can never
send information out.

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.967
And the one interesting
thing compare--

00:22:51.967 --> 00:22:54.300
yeah, one interesting thing
regarding this Schwarzschild

00:22:54.300 --> 00:22:55.720
radius.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:59.840
You said Schwarzschild
radius increase with mass.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.240
OK, if you increase the mass the
Schwarzschild radius increases.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.670
So in principal it
can be very large

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.029
when you can see the very
large object-- when you can

00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:10.195
see the very massive object.

00:23:15.660 --> 00:23:17.585
So now-- so let us summarize.

00:23:21.650 --> 00:23:24.780
Let us summarize.

00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:37.040
So for object of mass m there
are two important scales.

00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:43.555
Two important scales.

00:23:51.980 --> 00:24:01.876
So one is just the standard
Compton wavelengths,

00:24:01.876 --> 00:24:03.625
and the other is the
Schwarzschild radius.

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:15.440
So one is quantum and
the other is classical.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:17.310
The other is classical.

00:24:17.310 --> 00:24:20.750
So let's take the
ratio between them.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:22.484
Let's take the
ratio between them.

00:24:25.970 --> 00:24:31.710
So if you take the ratio
between them-- so let's

00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:37.212
forget about these two,
just to consider of order

00:24:37.212 --> 00:24:39.100
up to order 1.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:44.470
So c squared, divided
by H-bar, divided by mc.

00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:51.445
And then this again give you gm
m squared divided by H-bar c.

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:59.223
And then this is again just m
squared divided by mp squared.

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.200
This again is m squared
divided mp squared,

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.280
and p is the Planck mass.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:13.590
So let's consider the
different scenarios.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:15.120
So the first, let's
consider-- just

00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:20.050
suppose the mass of the object
is much, much greater than mp.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:24.935
OK, so in this case then
the Schwarzschild radius

00:25:24.935 --> 00:25:26.810
are much larger than
the Compton wavelengths.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.920
Much larger than the Compton
wavelengths, And essentially,

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:40.160
all of physics is controlled
by the classical gravity,

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:45.190
because you can no
longer probe-- yeah,

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.040
because a Compton
wavelengths is much,

00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:51.106
much inside the Schwarzschild
radius, which you cannot probe.

00:25:51.106 --> 00:25:53.105
So the physics is essentially
classical gravity.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:06.134
And the quantum effect
is not important,

00:26:06.134 --> 00:26:08.300
so you don't have to worry
about the quantum effect.

00:26:16.450 --> 00:26:17.690
I will put quote here.

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:25.032
Not quote, I will to put
some-- yeah, some quote here.

00:26:25.032 --> 00:26:26.240
You will see what this means.

00:26:32.130 --> 00:26:35.410
And the second possibility
is for mass much,

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:36.435
much smaller than p.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:43.980
So in this case, then
the Compton wavelengths

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:49.400
will be much, much greater
than the Schwarzschild radius.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.980
OK, so this is a quantum
object, so the quantum size

00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:56.280
is much larger than the
Schwarzschild radius.

00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:00.540
But we also know,
precisely in this region,

00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.149
this lambda g is
also very small.

00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:03.690
The effective strength
of the gravity

00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:04.740
is also very, very small.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.570
So we also have found before
that the lambda g is also

00:27:10.570 --> 00:27:13.380
very, very small.

00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:18.400
So in this case, as
what we said here--

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:30.414
the gravity is very
weak and not important.

00:27:30.414 --> 00:27:33.600
It's much, much weaker
than other interactions,

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.180
so you can essentially
ignore them.

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.540
Then we're only left
with the single scale

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:45.100
which mass is of all the mp.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:48.680
And then, as we said before, the
quantum gravity is important.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:51.350
So let me just say,
quantum gravity important.

00:28:02.862 --> 00:28:08.630
If this were the full story,
then life would be very boring.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:10.130
Even though it would
be very simple.

00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:18.470
Because the only scale you need
to worry about quantum gravity

00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:19.700
is essentially natural zero.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.730
It's only one scale.

00:28:21.730 --> 00:28:24.380
And it will take
us maybe hundred

00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.180
if not thousand years
to reach that scale

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.850
by whatever accelerator
or other probes.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:33.430
So there's really no urgency
to think about the quantum

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:35.060
gravity.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:39.420
Because right now we are
at this kind of scale.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.277
Right now we are
this kind of scale.

00:28:41.277 --> 00:28:43.110
It's very, very far
from this kind of scale.

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:52.990
But the remarkable thing about
black hole-- so this part

00:28:52.990 --> 00:28:57.270
of the physics is
essentially controlled

00:28:57.270 --> 00:28:59.760
by Schwarzschild radius,
because the Schwarzschild

00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:05.830
radius is the minimal classical
radius you can achieve.

00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:09.700
Yeah, you can probe the
system, and the quantum physics

00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.940
is relevant.

00:29:11.940 --> 00:29:19.852
But the remarkable thing
is that it turns out

00:29:19.852 --> 00:29:21.310
that this statement
is not correct.

00:29:25.195 --> 00:29:26.445
This statement is not correct.

00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.250
Actually, quantum
effect is important.

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:49.400
So the remarkable thing
is that the black hole

00:29:49.400 --> 00:30:06.280
can have quantum effect manifest
at the microscopic level.

00:30:12.810 --> 00:30:24.520
Say, at length scale of order
Schwarzschild radius, OK?

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.040
So that's why it makes the
black hole so interesting,

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:34.725
and also makes why black hole
is such a rich source of insight

00:30:34.725 --> 00:30:38.900
and information if you want
to know about quantum gravity.

00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:41.410
And as we will see,
actually, we also

00:30:41.410 --> 00:30:42.880
contain a rich
source information

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:46.640
about ordinary many body
systems, due to this duality.

00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.350
Any questions regarding this?

00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:57.190
Yes?

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:01.370
AUDIENCE: So when I talk about
the m much larger than mp,

00:31:01.370 --> 00:31:05.550
so the m is not only
an elementary particle,

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:07.510
it can be just and object?

00:31:07.510 --> 00:31:10.760
PROFESSOR: Yeah, it
can be a bound state.

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:14.550
So it can be-- here, we always
talking about quantum object.

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:19.190
But it can have mass very large.

00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.830
AUDIENCE: That's still
a quantum object?

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:22.690
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:27.780
What you will not see
from a traditional way,

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:30.800
for such a large
mass object, you

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.260
will not see its
quantum uncertainty,

00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:35.970
because quantum
uncertainty is tiny.

00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:37.780
The Compton wavelengths
is very tiny,

00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:39.980
and so the fluctuations
are very small.

00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:42.460
And so you have to probe
very, very small in scale

00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:45.430
to see its quantum-- from
traditional point of view,

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:47.720
we have to probe very,
very small in scale

00:31:47.720 --> 00:31:50.350
to see its quantum fluctuations.

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:52.090
And that scale is
much, much smaller

00:31:52.090 --> 00:31:53.631
than the Schwarzschild radius.

00:31:53.631 --> 00:31:54.172
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:31:57.205 --> 00:31:58.455
PROFESSOR: Any other question?

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.800
Good, so let me-- before
we talk more specific

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:13.215
about black holes, let me
just make one final remark.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:22.520
It's that in a sense,
this Planck length--

00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.490
this length scale
defined by Planck

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:30.340
can be considered as a
minimal localization length.

00:32:37.890 --> 00:32:40.460
OK, for the following reason.

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:45.900
So let's firstly imagine in
non gravitational physics--

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:57.350
so in non gravitational
physics if you

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:01.120
want to probe some short
distance scales then

00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.760
it's easy if you
are rich enough.

00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:07.600
Then you just
accelerate the particles

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.230
to very high energies.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:17.810
Say e plus, e minus,
with p and minus p.

00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:25.790
Then that can probe
the distance scale,

00:33:25.790 --> 00:33:27.765
then this can probe
length scales.

00:33:31.030 --> 00:33:35.576
Say of order h divided by p.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:45.820
OK, so if you make the
particle energy high enough

00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:52.900
you can, in principle, probe as
short as any scale as you want.

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:56.090
Anything, as far as you can make
this p as large as you want.

00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:09.460
So in principle, you can
take l all the way to zero.

00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.580
So the scale comes
all the way to 0.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.949
If you take p, go to infinity.

00:34:17.659 --> 00:34:19.416
But in gravity, this is not so.

00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:42.920
So with gravity the square
of the distance [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:58.280
so when your energy is
much, much greater than ep--

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:06.800
say, the Planck
mass-- then, as we

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:12.340
discussed from there-- so this
is a central mass energy, OK?

00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.680
Say if your central
mass image becomes

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.460
much, much larger than
the Planck scale-- Planck

00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:31.260
mass-- then rs controlled
by the image-- yeah,

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.590
and [INAUDIBLE] p.

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:38.002
Yeah, let me just
forget about c.

00:35:38.002 --> 00:35:43.840
Let me just say-- OK?

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:46.120
Then the Schwarzschild
radius from now

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:55.960
on-- so you go to y, OK?

00:35:55.960 --> 00:36:07.060
So the Schwarzschild
radius will take over

00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:13.690
as the minimal length scale.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:21.330
OK, so what's going to happen is
that if you collided these two

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:25.510
particles at very high energies,
then at a certain point,

00:36:25.510 --> 00:36:28.790
even before these two
particles meet together,

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:33.320
they already form a black holes
over the Schwarzschild sites,

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:34.460
OK?

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:39.390
If this energy is high enough,
then we will form black hole,

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:43.060
and then you can no longer
probe inside the Schwarzschild

00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:44.730
radius of that black hole.

00:36:44.730 --> 00:36:49.970
So that defines a new scale
which you can probe, OK?

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:55.480
So the funny thing about
this Schwarzschild radius

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:59.970
is that it's proportional
to energy, rather

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:03.200
inverse proportion to energy
as the standard Compton

00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.910
wavelengths, OK?

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:11.280
So after a certain point, when
you go beyond the Planck mass,

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:14.210
when you further
increase in the energy,

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.025
then you're actually probing the
larger distance scales rather

00:37:17.025 --> 00:37:19.700
than smaller distance scales,
due to the funny thing

00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:23.800
about the gravity and the
funny thing about black hole.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:34.890
OK, so actually, this scale
increases with p-- increase

00:37:34.890 --> 00:37:36.510
with you center of mass energy.

00:37:36.510 --> 00:37:49.280
OK, and the high energies
those two longer length scales.

00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:00.610
OK, this essentially
defines the Planck length

00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:02.420
as a minimal scale
one can probe.

00:38:20.168 --> 00:38:22.000
OK, so when your
center of mass energy

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.180
is smaller than the Planck
scale-- than the Planck mass--

00:38:26.180 --> 00:38:28.860
then your Compton wavelength
of course is larger than lp.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:35.990
But when this is
greater than mp,

00:38:35.990 --> 00:38:39.340
then as we discussed here--
then the Schwarzschild radius,

00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:44.200
of course, [INAUDIBLE] object
will be greater than the Planck

00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.330
side, and will break through
the common wavelengths

00:38:49.330 --> 00:38:54.220
and will be greater
than the Planck sides.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:57.730
And this give you, essentially,
the minimal radius to probe.

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:11.500
Alternatively, we can also
just reach the same argument.

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:14.370
Simply, I can just write
down a couple equations.

00:39:14.370 --> 00:39:15.995
So let's consider
you have uncertainty.

00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:27.710
So suppose you have a
position, data x, and then

00:39:27.710 --> 00:39:30.670
the answer in the energy
or momentum associated

00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:33.400
with the data x is data p.

00:39:37.570 --> 00:39:42.020
But on the other hand,
the distance you can probe

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:47.110
must be greater than the
Schwarzschild radius associated

00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:49.580
with lp, data p.

00:39:55.050 --> 00:39:58.030
OK, data p.

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:01.640
So if you combine these
two equations together-- so

00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:09.310
this is greater than
GN H-bar divided by lp.

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.110
So now I have suppressed the c.

00:40:12.110 --> 00:40:13.650
So you can see from
this equation--

00:40:13.650 --> 00:40:16.990
you can see that data
x must be greater

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:23.820
than H-bar GN, which is lp.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.870
OK, which is lp here.

00:40:31.790 --> 00:40:35.220
This is the same
argument as this one,

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:37.100
but this is a little bit formal.

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:40.340
So the essence is that once
you're energy is big enough,

00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:41.930
then you will create
the black hole,

00:40:41.930 --> 00:40:44.420
and then your physics
will completely change.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:50.907
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] black
hole evaporates [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:50.907 --> 00:40:54.900
they do not contain
that information.

00:40:54.900 --> 00:41:01.870
PROFESSOR: Right, yeah
so we will go into that.

00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:03.690
When the black hole
evaporate, we still

00:41:03.690 --> 00:41:05.530
don't probe the short--
it's still harder

00:41:05.530 --> 00:41:08.990
to probe the short
distance scale.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:10.550
Yeah, we will talk
about that later.

00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.700
So yeah, here just
a heuristic argument

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:21.452
to tell you that because
of this, actually

00:41:21.452 --> 00:41:22.660
the physics are very special.

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:27.240
The physics of the
gravity is very special.

00:41:30.848 --> 00:41:31.975
Any another questions?

00:41:37.290 --> 00:41:39.618
AUDIENCE: As a probe
for quantum gravity,

00:41:39.618 --> 00:41:42.280
I was thinking-- what if
there were some phenomenon

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:46.680
in which gravity is weak,
and it's a macroscopic scale,

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:51.110
but there's some kind
of coherence happening

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.902
that will-- maybe on the
scale of galaxies or something

00:41:54.902 --> 00:41:57.860
like that-- that will allow
quantum effects to manifest.

00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.804
Like an analogy of what
happens in a laser or something

00:42:01.804 --> 00:42:04.270
like that.

00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:07.640
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
that is black hole.

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.850
The black hole is
the way which gravity

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:15.690
can manifest at the quantum
effect that matches in scales.

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:19.640
And we don't know any
other ways for gravity

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.445
to manifest such quantum physics
at large distance scales.

00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:32.470
OK, so let me conclude this
I generally discussion.

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:38.510
Again, by reminding you
various regimes of gravity.

00:42:38.510 --> 00:42:41.915
Various regimes of the
gravity or quantum gravity.

00:43:01.720 --> 00:43:05.130
So in this
discussion, you should

00:43:05.130 --> 00:43:07.230
always-- in the
discussion I'm going

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:11.400
to do in the next minutes,
you should always think,

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.890
when I take the limit I
always keep my energy fixed.

00:43:14.890 --> 00:43:18.630
I keep the energy scale
I'm interested in fixed.

00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:21.350
I keep that fixed.

00:43:21.350 --> 00:43:29.250
So the classical gravity
regime is the regime

00:43:29.250 --> 00:43:31.990
in which you take
H-bar equals zero--

00:43:31.990 --> 00:43:40.470
take Newton constant finite--
and the regime of a particle

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:43.010
physics, we would
normally be, sometimes,

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:45.670
say, QFT in fixed space time.

00:43:52.180 --> 00:43:54.990
So this is a
quantum field theory

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:56.530
in the fixed space
time, including

00:43:56.530 --> 00:44:05.980
curved-- including curved.

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:10.580
So this is a regime in
which H-bar is finite,

00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:12.650
while you take the
Newton constant go to 0.

00:44:17.610 --> 00:44:22.850
And then there's, of course,
the quantum gravity regime,

00:44:22.850 --> 00:44:25.960
which is the GN and
the H-bar both finite.

00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:31.980
And then there's a very
interesting regime,

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.750
which is actually the
regime most of us work with.

00:44:38.640 --> 00:44:47.917
So there's also something
called the semiclassical regime

00:44:47.917 --> 00:44:48.750
for quantum gravity.

00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:59.790
So this is the regime
you keep H-bar finite,

00:44:59.790 --> 00:45:10.480
and you expand this system
in Newton constant, OK?

00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.290
So around-- so you
expanded whatever

00:45:13.290 --> 00:45:17.260
quantity Newton
constant around--

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:19.960
say G Newton equal to zero.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.830
So G Newton equal to 0
is the classical regime.

00:45:24.830 --> 00:45:29.520
It's the regime the
gravity's not important,

00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:32.000
but including H-bar.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.590
And now you can take into
account the quantum gravity

00:45:36.590 --> 00:45:40.550
fact, semiclassically, by
expanding around the GN.

00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:43.600
OK, so this is normally what
we call semiclassical regime

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:44.180
of gravity.

00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:53.580
Yes?

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:57.402
AUDIENCE: Do we know that
G goes to 0 [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:57.402 --> 00:45:59.390
and it's not some other part?

00:45:59.390 --> 00:46:03.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this
is a very good question.

00:46:03.300 --> 00:46:10.090
So this is indeed the question.

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:13.160
Indeed, most of the particles
regarding black hole

00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.760
is in this regime.

00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.940
So our current understanding of
quantum physics or black hole

00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:26.160
is in the semiclassical regime,
and you treat any matter field

00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:29.030
H-bar finite, but
the gravity's weak.

00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.650
And so there are
various indication

00:46:31.650 --> 00:46:34.070
that this limit is
actually not smooth,

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.085
but the only for very
subtle questions.

00:46:38.777 --> 00:46:40.610
For simple questions,
for typical questions,

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:42.150
actually this is a limit.

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:45.500
This limit is smooth, but there
can be very subtle questions

00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:47.400
which this limit is not smooth.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.950
And one such question is
this so-called the black hole

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:52.700
information loss,
and the subtle limit

00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:58.012
of taking this-- yeah, you
[INAUDIBLE] taking this limit.

00:46:58.012 --> 00:46:58.845
Any other questions?

00:47:04.630 --> 00:47:07.770
And this is a regime, actually,
we will work with most.

00:47:07.770 --> 00:47:10.850
OK, this is a regime
we will work with most.

00:47:10.850 --> 00:47:14.570
So we will always-- in
particular in nature.

00:47:14.570 --> 00:47:16.570
So right there I'm keeping
the H-bar explicitly,

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:19.300
but later I will also
set the H-bar equal to 1.

00:47:19.300 --> 00:47:22.450
And so H-bar will equal to-- so
we are always typically working

00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:23.640
with this regime.

00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:25.300
So H-bar equal to one.

00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:33.140
And then you will
have-- yeah, then

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.514
you take into account
the fact of GN

00:47:35.514 --> 00:47:36.680
in the perturbations series.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:46.720
Good, so now let's
move to the black hole.

00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:50.790
OK, with this-- yes?

00:47:50.790 --> 00:47:54.610
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Also working

00:47:54.610 --> 00:47:57.870
in the other
sermiclassical regime.

00:47:57.870 --> 00:48:02.490
I mean finite GN,
but expand H-bar.

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:11.380
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
this is not so much.

00:48:11.380 --> 00:48:17.340
It's because it's easy--
in some sense it's easy.

00:48:20.310 --> 00:48:24.700
So in a sense, we are
doing a little bit both.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:28.320
Yeah, so later-- right now I
don't want to go into that.

00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.860
You will see the effective
coupling constant

00:48:31.860 --> 00:48:37.670
and show the quantum gravity
fact is in fact H-bar times GN.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:39.590
It's H-bar times GN.

00:48:39.590 --> 00:48:42.070
And so the quantum gravity
fact will be important

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:44.300
when the H-bar times--
when you do perturbation

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:46.680
series H-bar times GN.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.260
So when I say you are
doing same thing GN,

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.630
essentially it's because
I'm fixing H-bar.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:54.300
So you're actually doing
perturbation series H-bar GN.

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:55.500
So you have to do both.

00:48:58.182 --> 00:48:59.015
Any other questions?

00:49:10.711 --> 00:49:11.210
Good.

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:21.410
Right, so now let's talk
about the black hole.

00:49:24.430 --> 00:49:26.150
Let's talk about
classical geometry.

00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:39.550
OK, so here I will
assume you already

00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:43.250
have some background in
GR-- in general relativity--

00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:46.000
and for example, you have
seen since Schwarzschild

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.970
metric, et cetera.

00:49:48.970 --> 00:49:51.110
And if you have not seen
a Schwarzschild metric,

00:49:51.110 --> 00:49:51.785
it's also OK.

00:49:54.630 --> 00:50:01.000
I think you should be able to
follow what I'm going to say.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.616
So for simplicity, right
now let me consider

00:50:03.616 --> 00:50:04.740
zero cosmological constant.

00:50:09.700 --> 00:50:13.750
OK, zero cosmological constant.

00:50:17.610 --> 00:50:20.150
OK, zero cosmological
constant corresponding to-- we

00:50:20.150 --> 00:50:25.600
consider symptotically
Minkowski space time.

00:50:25.600 --> 00:50:30.920
And so in the space time of zero
cosmological constant entered

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:45.120
in the space time metric
due to an object of mass m.

00:50:49.736 --> 00:51:04.545
It can be written as-- so this
is the famous Schwarzschild

00:51:04.545 --> 00:51:05.045
metric.

00:51:33.350 --> 00:51:38.980
And so of course
here we are assuming

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:50.000
this is a spherical symmetric,
and a neutral, et cetera.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.630
So this object does
not carry any charge.

00:51:55.480 --> 00:52:04.610
And this m and this f--
it's given by 1 minus 2m,

00:52:04.610 --> 00:52:10.810
mass divided by r, or it's
equal to rs divided by r.

00:52:10.810 --> 00:52:13.910
OK, so this rs is the
Schwarzschild radius.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:17.150
So now c is always equal to 1.

00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:27.980
So if this object-- so
we consider this object

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.320
is very close metric center.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:35.280
If this object have finite
sides, then of course

00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:37.935
this metric only is varied
outside this object.

00:52:40.830 --> 00:52:45.140
But if the sides
of this object is

00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:49.350
smaller than the
Schwarzschild radius,

00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:50.480
then this is a black hole.

00:52:50.480 --> 00:53:04.510
OK, and the black hold is
distinguished by event horizon

00:53:04.510 --> 00:53:07.980
and r equal to rs.

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:10.220
OK, and the r equal to rs.

00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:15.610
So at r equal to rs, you
see that this f becomes 0.

00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:18.220
OK, so f equals become 0.

00:53:18.220 --> 00:53:26.800
So essentially at here gtt-- so
the metric for the tt component

00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:35.720
is becomes 0, and the grr, the
metric before the r component

00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.445
become infinite.

00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:49.300
And another thing is that when
r becomes smaller than rs,

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.845
the f switch sign.

00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:04.270
So f become active, and then
in this case then the r become

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:07.850
time coordinates and the t
becomes spatial coordinates,

00:54:07.850 --> 00:54:12.206
when you go inside
to the r equal to rs.

00:54:12.206 --> 00:54:14.450
OK, this is just a
feature of this metric.

00:54:17.490 --> 00:54:24.720
So now let me say some simple
fact about this metric.

00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:38.660
So most of them I
expect you know--

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.120
I expect you know of them.

00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:52.290
But just to remind you
some of those facts

00:54:52.290 --> 00:54:54.670
will be important later.

00:54:54.670 --> 00:54:59.800
OK, so these are
mostly reminders.

00:55:03.490 --> 00:55:10.992
So first, this metric-- if you
look at this metric itself,

00:55:10.992 --> 00:55:12.200
it's time reversal invariant.

00:55:20.860 --> 00:55:26.350
OK, because if you
take t go to minus t,

00:55:26.350 --> 00:55:31.070
of course the invariant
on the t goes to minus t.

00:55:31.070 --> 00:55:35.350
OK, so this-- actually,
because of this,

00:55:35.350 --> 00:55:39.320
this cannot describe
a real black hole.

00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:45.010
So the real life black hole
arise from the gravitational

00:55:45.010 --> 00:55:48.650
collapse, and the gravitational
collapse cannot be a time

00:55:48.650 --> 00:55:50.270
symmetric process, OK?

00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:53.200
So this cannot describe-- so
this does not describe a real

00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:57.830
black hole, but it's a good
approximation to the real life

00:55:57.830 --> 00:56:01.019
black hole after this
object have stabilized.

00:56:01.019 --> 00:56:03.060
So after the gravitational
collapse has finished.

00:56:05.620 --> 00:56:10.710
So this is a mathematical--
in some sense,

00:56:10.710 --> 00:56:18.859
it is a mathematical
idealization

00:56:18.859 --> 00:56:24.230
of real life black hole.

00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:30.712
OK, so this is first remark.

00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:42.770
So the second remark is that
despite this grr goes infinity,

00:56:42.770 --> 00:56:44.290
this metric component
goes infinity.

00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:54.650
So the space time is
non-singular at the horizon.

00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:07.110
OK, so you can check
it by computing,

00:57:07.110 --> 00:57:11.240
say, curvature invariants
of this metric.

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:14.304
You find the number of the--
all the curvature invariant

00:57:14.304 --> 00:57:15.220
that are well-defined.

00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:22.570
So this horizon is
just the coordinate--

00:57:22.570 --> 00:57:24.600
you can show that
this horizon is just

00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:25.700
a coordinate singularity.

00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:36.360
Which we will see--
actually, we will see it

00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:42.310
in maybe next lecture, or maybe
at the end of today's lecture,

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:45.430
that just this
coordinate, r and the t,

00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:48.717
coordinate become singular.

00:57:48.717 --> 00:57:50.300
The coordinate itself
become singular.

00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:12.660
So this t, we normally
call it Schwarzschild time.

00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.640
So let me just introduce a name.

00:58:14.640 --> 00:58:17.325
So this t, we call it
the Schwarzschild time.

00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:33.050
So Schwarzschild
found this solution

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:40.860
while fighting first World
War, really in the battlefield.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:44.760
And a couple months after
he finished this metric,

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.150
he died from some disease.

00:58:53.490 --> 00:58:54.850
Right, this is that.

00:58:58.740 --> 00:59:05.000
So another thing, you
can easily check yourself

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:12.706
with r equal to rs-- the
horizon is a null surface-- is

00:59:12.706 --> 00:59:13.580
a null hyper surface.

00:59:22.090 --> 00:59:24.160
It's a null hyper surface.

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:32.670
The null hyper surface just
say this surface contains

00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:34.690
geodesics which are null.

00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:44.690
And this is a-- the third remark
is an extremely important one,

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:50.680
which we will use many
times in the future.

00:59:50.680 --> 01:00:03.750
We said the horizon is a surface
of infinite red shift compared

01:00:03.750 --> 01:00:13.290
to the-- infinite red shift
from the perspective of observed

01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:15.930
infinity, OK?

01:00:15.930 --> 01:00:19.500
So let me save time, now, to
add to this qualifying remark

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:23.440
from the perspective
of observed infinity.

01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:28.100
So now let me just illustrate
this point a little bit more

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:30.000
explicitly.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:39.550
So let's consider observer--
consider an observer-- so

01:00:39.550 --> 01:00:46.550
let me call oh-- at some
hyper surface r, which

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:51.430
is close to the horizon.

01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:57.060
Yeah, say as someplace which
is close to the horizon.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:05.030
Slightly outside the horizon.

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:08.620
And let us consider
another observer,

01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:16.890
which I call o infinity,
which at i go to infinity.

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:21.630
OK, very far away
from the black hole.

01:01:21.630 --> 01:01:26.300
So let's first look
at this observer.

01:01:26.300 --> 01:01:34.490
So the i equals infinity,
then your metric-- so at i

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:37.120
equals infinity, this
f just becomes one,

01:01:37.120 --> 01:01:41.140
because when your r goes to
infinity, this r just become 1.

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.469
And then this become the
standard Minkowski space

01:01:44.469 --> 01:01:46.260
time, written in the
spherical coordinates.

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:59.130
So we just have the standard
Minkowski time written

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:01.340
in spherical coordinates.

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.133
And then from here
you can immediately

01:02:03.133 --> 01:02:08.050
see-- so this t is what we
call Schwarzschild time.

01:02:08.050 --> 01:02:16.100
t is the proper time for
this observed infinity.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:18.580
Say, for o infinity.

01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:30.210
OK, so now let's look at
someplace i equal to rh.

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:37.330
So at i equal to
rh, then the metric

01:02:37.330 --> 01:02:44.690
is given by minus f rh
dt squared with the rest.

01:02:44.690 --> 01:02:53.090
OK, and to define the proper
time for the observer at-- we

01:02:53.090 --> 01:02:55.875
can just directly write
it as minus d tau squared.

01:02:55.875 --> 01:02:59.020
So that's the proper
time observed by observer

01:02:59.020 --> 01:03:02.360
at this hyper surface, OK?

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:06.370
So then we concludes--
so let me call it tau h.

01:03:06.370 --> 01:03:12.818
So we conclude that
the problem time for oh

01:03:12.818 --> 01:03:18.610
is given by f 1/2 rh times dt.

01:03:18.610 --> 01:03:22.050
OK, so it relates to the
proper time at infinity

01:03:22.050 --> 01:03:22.884
by this factor.

01:03:28.460 --> 01:03:31.670
So if I write it more
explicitly-- so this

01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:37.670
is 1 minus rh, divided
by rs 1/2 times dt.

01:03:46.090 --> 01:04:12.860
So we see that as rh--
suppose this observer--

01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:19.520
the location of this observer
approach the horizon, say,

01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:26.850
if rh approach to rs, then
this d tau h divided by dt

01:04:26.850 --> 01:04:27.760
will go to 0.

01:04:35.730 --> 01:04:44.560
So that means
compared to the time

01:04:44.560 --> 01:05:02.740
at infinity the time at r equal
to rs becomes infinite now.

01:05:02.740 --> 01:05:06.200
So-- or approximate, let me
say, becomes infinite now.

01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:24.730
So that means any
finite interval--

01:05:24.730 --> 01:05:30.550
any finite proper time
interval for observer at oh--

01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:35.560
for this oh-- when you
view [INAUDIBLE] infinity

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:37.640
become infinitely null, OK?

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:39.890
Become very long time scale.

01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:41.860
OK, become very long time scale.

01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:49.710
So you can also
invert this relation.

01:05:49.710 --> 01:05:54.170
OK, you can also invert
the recent relation.

01:05:54.170 --> 01:06:02.980
Say, suppose some
event of energy

01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:15.282
with energy eh--
with proper energy

01:06:15.282 --> 01:06:23.790
eh-- say, for this observer
at oh, for this observer oh.

01:06:23.790 --> 01:06:31.750
Then because of the time
relation between them,

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:34.800
because of the time
relation between them,

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:45.170
then from the perspective
of this observer at infinity

01:06:45.170 --> 01:06:50.470
the energy is given just but
you invert the [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:50.470 --> 01:06:54.600
between the time, because of
the energy and time conjugate.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:07:00.040
So the e infinity becomes
eh times this f 1/2 rh.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:10.100
So for this just again says,
in a slightly different way,

01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:19.780
that for any finite eh local
proper energy-- so this

01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:26.000
is a local proper energy
for the observer at oh--

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:30.160
this e infinity--
the same event viewed

01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:35.130
form the perspective of the
observer at infinity goes to 0.

01:07:35.130 --> 01:07:39.500
S rh goes to rs.

01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:52.960
So that e is infinity
red shifted--

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.430
become infinite red shift.

01:07:54.430 --> 01:08:00.930
So any process with
local proper energy

01:08:00.930 --> 01:08:02.940
viewed from infinity
corresponding

01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:06.520
to very, very low
energy process.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.130
So this actually will play
a very important role.

01:08:09.130 --> 01:08:11.630
This feature will play
a very important role

01:08:11.630 --> 01:08:14.303
when later we talk about
holographic duality

01:08:14.303 --> 01:08:18.382
and it's implication, say, for
the field series, et cetera.

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:21.819
Yes?

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:24.309
AUDIENCE: So this is
just a pedantic comment,

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:27.795
but I think you need a minus
sign in front of your f,

01:08:27.795 --> 01:08:31.779
just to make sure proper
time isn't imaginary.

01:08:31.779 --> 01:08:35.418
PROFESSOR: Sorry,
which minus sign?

01:08:35.418 --> 01:08:38.260
AUDIENCE: In the d tau stage.

01:08:38.260 --> 01:08:41.160
PROFESSOR: You mean here?

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:42.154
You mean here or here?

01:08:42.154 --> 01:08:43.029
AUDIENCE: Below that.

01:08:43.029 --> 01:08:48.580
PROFESSOR: Below that,
yeah-- oh, sorry, sorry.

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:52.120
Thank you, I wrote it wrong.

01:08:52.120 --> 01:08:55.460
It should be rs rh.

01:08:55.460 --> 01:08:58.013
Yeah, because rs is above.

01:08:58.013 --> 01:09:04.640
Sorry, yeah-- so rs is above, so
varied rh, so rh is downstairs.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:10.300
Thank you, so rh is--
so I always consider rh

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:14.910
as [INAUDIBLE] equal to rs, OK?

01:09:18.547 --> 01:09:19.380
Any other questions?

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:28.520
OK, and so some other fact.

01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:32.170
And again, I will
just list them.

01:09:32.170 --> 01:09:33.859
I will just them.

01:09:33.859 --> 01:09:37.750
If you're not
familiar with them,

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:41.490
it should be very easy for
you to go through them,

01:09:41.490 --> 01:09:46.149
to re-derive them, with a
little bit knowledge in gr.

01:09:51.189 --> 01:10:03.780
So number four is that it takes
a free fall-- free fall means

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:12.410
we just follow geodesics--
free fall of a traveler

01:10:12.410 --> 01:10:23.160
a finite proper time
to reach the horizon--

01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:39.614
say, from the infinity-- but
infinite Schwarzschild time.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:50.440
So also you can easily
check that it actually

01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.770
takes infinite Schwarzschild
time for object

01:10:53.770 --> 01:10:55.960
to fall through the horizon.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.830
But from the free
fall observer itself,

01:10:58.830 --> 01:11:02.440
it's actually just
finite proper time.

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.760
And so from the perspective
of the observer at infinity,

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.330
it looks like this object
never fall into the black hole.

01:11:11.330 --> 01:11:14.470
It's just frozen at the horizon.

01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:27.740
So another remark is that
once inside the horizon-- that

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:33.250
means when r becomes
smaller than rs--

01:11:33.250 --> 01:12:03.230
the traveler can not
send signals to outside,

01:12:03.230 --> 01:12:05.528
nor can he escape.

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:11.970
So that's why this is
called even horizon.

01:12:11.970 --> 01:12:16.290
So we will see this
slightly later.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:18.155
In next lecture we will
see this explicitly.

01:12:21.890 --> 01:12:28.530
So finally, there are two
important geometric quantities

01:12:28.530 --> 01:12:31.197
associated with the horizon.

01:12:31.197 --> 01:12:50.159
Two important geometric-- OK?

01:12:52.680 --> 01:13:02.130
So the first one is the
area of the spatial section.

01:13:02.130 --> 01:13:08.410
So suppose-- so let's consider
we are at i equal to rs,

01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:12.120
and then here you just
said r equal to rs,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:15.357
and then this is a
two-dimensional sphere, OK?

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:17.190
So this two-dimensional
sphere corresponding

01:13:17.190 --> 01:13:19.490
to a spatial section
of the horizon.

01:13:22.890 --> 01:13:33.499
So first, A is the area
of a spatial section.

01:13:40.360 --> 01:13:46.600
So you can just say let's
look at the area of this part

01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:50.210
with the r equal to
the horizon radius.

01:13:50.210 --> 01:13:55.820
So this just give you a
equal to ah ah, equal to 4

01:13:55.820 --> 01:13:59.030
pi rs squared.

01:13:59.030 --> 01:14:12.370
And this rs is 2GN, so this
become 16 pi GN squared.

01:14:12.370 --> 01:14:16.520
OK, so this is one of the key
quantities of a black hole

01:14:16.520 --> 01:14:17.850
horizon.

01:14:17.850 --> 01:14:22.919
It's what we call
the horizon area, OK?

01:14:22.919 --> 01:14:24.210
What we call this horizon area.

01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:31.750
And the B is called
the surface gravity.

01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:39.760
B is called service gravity.

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:43.570
So the surface
gravity is defined

01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:59.986
by the acceleration of
a stationary observer

01:14:59.986 --> 01:15:12.870
at the horizon as
measured at infinity.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:22.750
OK, at infinity means
at spatial infinity.

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:27.080
So you can-- if you are not
familiar with this concept

01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:31.920
of surface gravity, you can
find it in standard textbooks.

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:48.130
For example, the Wald say page
158, and also section-- OK.

01:15:48.130 --> 01:15:52.170
Just try to check it there.

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:54.670
So, say, suppose you
have a black hole.

01:15:59.490 --> 01:16:02.490
Say this is the
Schwarzschild radius.

01:16:02.490 --> 01:16:05.710
Of course, things want to
fall into the black hole.

01:16:05.710 --> 01:16:09.730
So if you want to
remain at a fixed

01:16:09.730 --> 01:16:12.980
location outside the black
hole, then you really

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.520
have to accelerate.

01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:18.230
You have to fire some engine
to keep yourself to stay there.

01:16:18.230 --> 01:16:22.250
And you can calculate what
is acceleration you need

01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:26.120
to be able to stay here, OK?

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:28.330
And once you are closer
and closer to the horizon,

01:16:28.330 --> 01:16:30.705
that acceleration becomes
bigger and bigger-- eventually,

01:16:30.705 --> 01:16:34.620
becomes infinity when
you approach the horizon.

01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:41.220
But because of this
red shift effect,

01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:48.210
when this acceleration is viewed
from the units for observer

01:16:48.210 --> 01:16:51.990
at affinity, then you have
infinity divided by infinity,

01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:54.650
then turns out to be finite.

01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:57.330
And this is called
a surface gravity.

01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:59.810
It's normally called a kappa.

01:16:59.810 --> 01:17:01.410
Normally called a kappa.

01:17:01.410 --> 01:17:04.090
And this is one of
basic quantities--

01:17:04.090 --> 01:17:06.270
basic geometric
quantities of the horizon.

01:17:06.270 --> 01:17:08.410
So I will not derive it here.

01:17:08.410 --> 01:17:10.600
I don't have time.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:14.240
And if you want to
see this, Wald's book.

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.600
So you can calculate
that this is just

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:22.210
given by 1/2 the
derivative of this function

01:17:22.210 --> 01:17:28.300
f evaluated at the
horizon location.

01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:33.920
OK, so f is equal to 0 at the
horizon, but f prime is not.

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.920
OK, so you can easily calculate.

01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:45.730
So this is 1 over 2rs from here,
and is equal to 1 over 4GN.

01:17:49.482 --> 01:17:53.070
OK, so this is another
very important quantity

01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:55.440
for the black hole.

01:17:55.440 --> 01:18:00.690
Actually, I think right now
is a good place to stop.

01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:07.480
OK, so let's stop
here for today,

01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:10.510
and the next time we
will describe-- then

01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:12.805
from here we will discuss
the causal structure

01:18:12.805 --> 01:18:16.320
of the black hole, and then
you will see explicitly

01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.480
some of this statement, if
you have not seen them before.

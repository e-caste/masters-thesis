00:00:21.931 --> 00:00:25.370
GARY GENSLER: So this is
the last use case day.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.020
And then Tuesday we'll wrap up.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.420
And I know that you all
are preparing for finals

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.189
and writing final projects.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.890
So it thins out at the end.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.720
So I thank you all
for showing up,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.460
those of you that
are still here.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.830
I also want to compliment.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.610
I didn't get through all
of the papers seriously.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.775
But I did my best to read
them quickly last night

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.280
and today, that were
submitted for today.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.040
And just like the ones on trade
finance, they're really good.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.740
And if there was anything
that was kind of the learning

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.170
objective of this--

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.260
don't get too happy, James.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.807
AUDIENCE: I submitted
mine just now.

00:01:06.807 --> 00:01:07.890
GARY GENSLER: What's that?

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.990
Yeah.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.510
I read it.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.950
It was like two hours
ago, you put it in.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.320
AUDIENCE: I've got a
slightly improved version.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.760
GARY GENSLER: Oh, I don't
think Canvas let's that.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.480
That's going to be a
double spend wouldn't it?

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.980
Sure.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.630
Send it in.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.260
Send it in.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.490
It's to show critical
reasoning skills.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.880
What is this new technology?

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.000
Why does blockchain
technology make sense?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.860
And just like in trade finance
and identity management,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.617
there's data that
really matters.

00:01:40.617 --> 00:01:41.950
And we'll talk about this a bit.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.260
But the data really does matter,
our identity and so forth.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.650
But I wanted to turn
back to trade finance,

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.190
just for a minute, because James
had challenged the whole group

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.920
about supply chain management.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.140
And Lauren was a little quiet.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.090
But she knows I'm
going to call on her.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.920
So this isn't a cold call.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.560
But Lauren, you want to give
your view on this a little bit?

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.240
Lauren who worked in
supply chain management

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.620
for four or five years.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:13.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.140
So the big thing, I worked in
supply chain sustainability,

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.810
and there's been a huge push.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.700
The De Beers thing
touched on this.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.430
There's been a huge push over
the past five to 10 years

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.610
to just increase traceability
and transparency through supply

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.340
chains to make sure conflict
minerals going to make sure

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.770
that things aren't
using a lot of water

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.890
in water stressed
areas and things.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.282
There's been a huge
push for transparency

00:02:38.282 --> 00:02:39.740
through the supply
chain and trying

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.290
to figure out how
companies can basically

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.490
like audit and assess their
suppliers, can take it

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:47.720
layers back.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.380
And so one big thing now
is it's all done through--

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.510
most companies do it
through assessments.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.540
So annually, companies
assess their suppliers

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.970
and hope that they submit
all this accurate information

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.640
and hope that their suppliers
are doing the same things

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.510
throughout the supply chain.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.880
But there is very little
transparency into it.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.220
It's very hard to verify.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.390
And there's really asymmetrical
information on all sides.

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.520
So block chain
would be, I think,

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.907
for sustainability purposes.

00:03:17.907 --> 00:03:20.240
Because right now you're just
like hoping that companies

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.030
are allocating the
proper time and resources

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.560
to go through and track their
raw materials and suppliers

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.780
and things.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.530
But there's no real
verifiable or transparent way

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.170
for it to be done.

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.050
And so right now,
a lot of customers

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.233
are hoping that their
suppliers, they're taking them

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:42.650
at face value when
they say things

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.067
like, we don't use
child labor, we

00:03:44.067 --> 00:03:47.660
don't source from
these certain regions.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.880
But there's really
no way to verify it.

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.810
So I think a big opportunity
for blockchain and supply chain

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.986
is helping increase that
traceability so that you

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:59.840
know you're not coming from
places where child labor is OK.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.540
Ideally, you're coming from
places with good safety

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.940
standards and things like that.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.920
GARY GENSLER: Have
we gotten at least--

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.350
are you still on the rock
bottom minimalist side

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.070
of supply chain blockchain
management, blockchain

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.893
technology?

00:04:12.893 --> 00:04:14.060
AUDIENCE: Marginally better.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.920
GARY GENSLER: Marginally better.

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.110
But that's what's
wonderful about this class.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.230
And even the eight
or 10 papers that I

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:26.330
read about identity management,
identity and access management

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.750
systems and blockchain
technology, ranged.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.150
I don't think I read
any that were at a zero.

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.853
There were no
absolute minimalists.

00:04:33.853 --> 00:04:35.270
But there were
some of your papers

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.460
that veered towards that.

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.050
And Alin, who's going to
talk to us probably sometime

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:44.180
during the day, I'd
say your paper veered

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.268
towards the most maximalist
side I'd seen yet in 23 classes.

00:04:51.268 --> 00:04:53.185
AUDIENCE: With respect
to a certain definition

00:04:53.185 --> 00:04:55.460
of digital identity,
which is probably

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.390
different than what
most people think about.

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:59.390
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.760
So we're going to
hear from Alin maybe

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.100
in 20 minutes or something.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.410
But mind you, that's the
surprise of the class.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:09.590
He's moved to the
maximalist side, at least

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.760
on one application for
blockchain technology, which

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.930
is also, I think, the
right place to be.

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.140
This is a technology that
might have use cases that work

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.760
and others that are just hype.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.030
There might even be some
digital native tokens

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.630
that will survive.

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.160
And most, in my thought, won't.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.680
But there might
be some that make

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.330
sense, probably more
blockchain technology

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.500
applications than tokens.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:47.770
But we'll start going
through identity.

00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:52.330
Again, we'll talk a
little bit about identity

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.200
before we get into it, identity
and access management systems.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.840
But what is identity?

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.610
Then, the sort of
management of them,

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:02.750
particularly in a digital age.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.020
Some state projects
in India and Estonia.

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.670
And then some
blockchain technology

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.330
projects, private
sector in essence.

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.540
And then, of course, some
of you might be graduating.

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:17.770
And we'll talk about MITs.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:19.240
It is MIT, had to do that.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.780
And the study questions were,
what are the trade offs.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.180
What does it mean to be
self-sovereign identity?

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.610
And how might blockchain
technology address that?

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.760
And we'll see a show of
hands later how many of you

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.970
plan to get your MIT
diploma on blockchain.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.622
I hope, by the way, that all of
you plan to get an MIT diploma.

00:06:43.622 --> 00:06:45.580
But there are some of
you that are from Harvard

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.170
here and from other schools.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.760
So maybe you'll
come back to MIT.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.820
And then there was a
handful of readings

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.000
which, at least
from the write ups,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.420
seem like they
reasonably did its job.

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.740
So what is identity?

00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:03.910
This is an open question.

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:07.380
Tom.

00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.880
What's identity?

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.150
AUDIENCE: I was going
to defer to someone

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.233
who wrote the paper today.

00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:12.540
GARY GENSLER: You were
going to defer to somebody.

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:13.170
I see.

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.490
I see.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.470
Who wants to say
what identity is?

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.000
James, you wrote
a paper for today.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.070
AUDIENCE: You have
a birth certificate,

00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:21.590
identifies you as an individual.

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:22.590
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.682
So is a birth
certificate identity?

00:07:25.682 --> 00:07:27.955
AUDIENCE: No.

00:07:27.955 --> 00:07:30.172
GARY GENSLER: Who's saying no?

00:07:30.172 --> 00:07:32.380
AUDIENCE: I don't think that
the birth certificate is

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.000
an identity because
you can also be

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.580
identified, for
example, biometrically

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.380
or with your fingerprint.

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.738
So it is not only for
birth certificate.

00:07:44.546 --> 00:07:46.240
AUDIENCE: But it is an identity.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.740
Like if you go to the DMV and
you're going to get a license,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.282
you need a birth
certificate to show.

00:07:50.282 --> 00:07:51.282
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:07:51.282 --> 00:07:52.930
But is the birth
certificate identity?

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.472
AUDIENCE: It is not
what identifies--

00:07:54.472 --> 00:07:56.770
AUDIENCE: It is like an
identifier for [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.620
GARY GENSLER: Identifier.

00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.620
It's a certificate.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:00.220
Right?

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.000
Hugo?

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:01.630
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:05.227
I mean, I feel like this is
super philosophical question.

00:08:05.227 --> 00:08:06.600
GARY GENSLER: Well, maybe.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.278
Do you feeling
uncomfortable with that?

00:08:08.278 --> 00:08:08.820
AUDIENCE: No.

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:09.820
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.180
Good.

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.380
AUDIENCE: Like identity is
basically like who you are.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.990
And all of the things that
prove your identity currently

00:08:16.990 --> 00:08:20.980
are government issued documents
or like school issue documents

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.130
that prove that somebody else
has already done a background

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:27.061
check to make sure that you
are who you say you are.

00:08:27.061 --> 00:08:28.970
GARY GENSLER: Brotish.

00:08:28.970 --> 00:08:31.600
AUDIENCE: I think identity
is kind of contextual.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.340
So sometimes it can
be a date of birth.

00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:34.620
Sometimes it can be
your nationality.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.919
Sometimes it can be your face.

00:08:35.919 --> 00:08:39.394
It depends on the
context what identity is.

00:08:39.394 --> 00:08:40.330
GARY GENSLER: Eric.

00:08:40.330 --> 00:08:42.610
AUDIENCE: It should
be identity is--

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:46.380
going back to the
philosophical domain.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.780
Identity is what defines
you as a unique individual

00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.000
and differentiates
you from anybody else.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:53.046
Right?

00:08:53.046 --> 00:08:58.720
And use additional
instruments to serve

00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:05.410
the purpose of identifying
you as an individual

00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:11.050
to certain contexts, as Brotish
mentioned, that the identity is

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.360
inherent to a person, not
an additional artifact,

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.780
in my understanding.

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:19.410
GARY GENSLER: So how many
people agree with Eric?

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:22.195
It's something unique
that identifies.

00:09:22.195 --> 00:09:23.180
AUDIENCE: I agree.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:24.180
GARY GENSLER: You agree.

00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:26.600
AUDIENCE: I think it has to
be something that you can

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:29.140
verify in order to be identity.

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.125
Otherwise it's just
a piece of paper.

00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:32.500
GARY GENSLER:
Wait, you think you

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.720
have to be able to verify it.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.820
But Eric was saying
that it's unique.

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.593
It's something
about our humanity.

00:09:38.593 --> 00:09:39.510
It's about who we are.

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.120
AUDIENCE: I think,
as Hugo said, I

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.480
think it's very philosophical.

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.630
I think it's who I am.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:52.170
So like my identity is like what
my name, what date of birth,

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.598
and my iris, and my
finger, this is who I am.

00:09:56.598 --> 00:09:58.140
And I think what
you're talking about

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:02.730
is more like how can the
society verify that you are

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.286
the one who you claim to be.

00:10:05.286 --> 00:10:07.130
So I think there's
different kind of layers

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:08.000
that we're talking sense.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.490
GARY GENSLER: Alexis.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.532
AUDIENCE: I think it's
like not unique in a sense

00:10:10.532 --> 00:10:15.300
that it's like characteristics
that someone has.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:18.960
But like maybe someone else will
have the same characteristics.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:24.030
But it's more, Jahib just
said, like basically someone

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.490
can verify that what
you say is true.

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:28.340
Like if you have
these characteristics,

00:10:28.340 --> 00:10:30.360
that's part of your identity.

00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.615
But it's not like unique in
the sense that it's just--

00:10:33.615 --> 00:10:36.090
GARY GENSLER: So, Alexis,
are you saying your identity

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.060
is not unique?

00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.060
Or are you saying certain
attributes [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:40.268
AUDIENCE: It's unique for me.

00:10:40.268 --> 00:10:44.310
But it's just like aggregation
of characteristics.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.320
GARY GENSLER: Aggregation
of characteristics.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.770
We are going to
get philosophical.

00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:48.340
This is good.

00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.132
AUDIENCE: If you want
to get philosophical,

00:10:50.132 --> 00:10:53.010
you can say that
the identity is what

00:10:53.010 --> 00:10:58.140
the society imposes upon you,
or what the society makes up

00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:58.830
of you.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.170
Because, for instance,
a name itself

00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:03.100
is not [INAUDIBLE] itself.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:09.840
It's something that the society
or common culture construct.

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.480
GARY GENSLER: So you're saying
it's not just who you are,

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:15.390
but how society accepts you.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:19.170
In a commercial sense,
in an economic sense,

00:11:19.170 --> 00:11:21.290
identity is used
for so many things.

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.400
I do believe-- and maybe
it is philosophical.

00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:28.290
I do believe that we
are each unique souls.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.020
And so that's a
belief system, maybe.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:35.580
But in an economic sense,
we have various attributes.

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.510
So those attributes
might be shared.

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:41.890
I know, in fact, yeah.

00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:42.690
Woo.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.550
So what is identity?

00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:48.330
There is a dude up
there that I share DNA

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:54.960
with, exact replicable
genetic material.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.200
But I, for one, think
that I'm unique from him

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.210
and I have a different identity.

00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:02.450
And you can be guessing, while
you pull this down from Canvas,

00:12:02.450 --> 00:12:04.510
who's who.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.910
It's not a test.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.988
What's that, James?

00:12:07.988 --> 00:12:09.405
AUDIENCE: You're
on the left side.

00:12:09.405 --> 00:12:11.530
GARY GENSLER: I don't know
which side you're pointing to.

00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:13.870
AUDIENCE: Technically, the
left side of the photograph.

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.140
AUDIENCE: You're on the--

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.240
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.820
AUDIENCE: As we see it, on the
left side of the photograph.

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.910
GARY GENSLER: I see.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.410
Yeah.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:20.910
Yeah.

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:22.020
You're correct.

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.740
But see, we're unique.

00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.810
Different identities.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.300
Same DNA.

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:33.210
Who has an iPhone
with face recognition?

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.770
So on Thanksgiving, Rob
hands me his iPhone.

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:39.600
He says, what do you see?

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.170
He says, just look at it.

00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:45.060
And I look at it and I say, I
see a bunch of text messages.

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.290
Why?

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:48.120
And he cursed.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:54.630
And he said, I handed
you my locked phone.

00:12:54.630 --> 00:13:00.270
So whatever you think about
biometrics and iPhones,

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.890
it didn't work.

00:13:01.890 --> 00:13:02.850
Or it does work.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:04.050
I don't know.

00:13:04.050 --> 00:13:07.260
So I handed him back my
iPhone, which a little older.

00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:10.170
And I said, could you open it
for me with your thumb print.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:12.080
And he couldn't.

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:15.320
So just for now,
we have a number

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.530
of sets of identical twins in
my father's family and so forth.

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:25.880
So he tried it with two of our
identical twin cousins, two

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.780
women.

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:30.110
And they, too, can open
each other's phones.

00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:31.301
AUDIENCE: With fingerprints?

00:13:31.301 --> 00:13:34.460
GARY GENSLER: No, with
their face recognition.

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.430
Not with fingerprints but
with face recognition.

00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:43.080
So it just is a little
side story about identity.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.150
Eric.

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:47.000
AUDIENCE: Just a comment that
there's a function in Facebook

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.210
that shows you a
list of photographs

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:54.860
that you potentially can
be identified and tag you.

00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:57.790
So I keep getting pictures
of my twin brother, too.

00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:59.110
So, yeah.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:02.238
Very poor face
recognition today.

00:14:02.238 --> 00:14:03.530
GARY GENSLER: You're identical?

00:14:03.530 --> 00:14:05.340
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:06.400
GARY GENSLER: OK.

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.940
When I hear
fraternal, then I have

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:10.620
another thing about Facebook.

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.130
AUDIENCE: But there is
actually a much simpler way

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:14.540
to define identity.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.130
Philosophy aside, there is
this physical human being,

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:20.540
and there's billions
of them on the planet.

00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.720
And one simple way to
think about it is you

00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:26.200
want to hash each person.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:27.200
GARY GENSLER: All right.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:27.770
We're back.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:29.360
We're back to the
hash functions.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:30.277
This is good.

00:14:30.277 --> 00:14:32.360
AUDIENCE: But that's
actually what you want to do.

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.910
You want to hash each
person and get a number.

00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:37.370
And the property of that
is that if you come to me

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.000
and I hash you, I
get some number.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.875
And if you come again,
I get the same number.

00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:42.680
So I know I'm dealing
with the same person.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.120
GARY GENSLER: Even
if I put weight?

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:45.620
AUDIENCE: Even if
you put on weight.

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:48.295
I can hash because I can
use your iris, let's say.

00:14:48.295 --> 00:14:49.670
Then your twin
brother presumably

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.712
won't have the same iris.

00:14:50.712 --> 00:14:54.270
I'm actually not sure, but
I don't think you will.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:56.000
So now a hash you, I
get the same number,

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:56.990
I know who I'm
dealing with, and this

00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:59.115
solves a lot of the problems
in the business world.

00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:03.750
Like KYC, getting a credit card
at a bank, stuff like that.

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:06.200
And it also solves the problem,
are you a new customer.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.120
Well, is your hash one of
the new hashes that I--

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.070
is your hash a hash that
I've seen in the past?

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.250
So that's a very simple
way to think of identity.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:16.750
And you put philosophy
aside and you

00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:19.900
assume that there is some
physicality of human beings

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:21.520
that you can distinguish
between using

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.580
a hash function of some sort.

00:15:22.580 --> 00:15:24.038
So the question is
like, how do you

00:15:24.038 --> 00:15:27.190
implement this hash function.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.080
GARY GENSLER: So
you're not really

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:31.670
putting philosophy to the side.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:35.940
You're saying, that may
be all well and good,

00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:40.020
but you can also take a
physical object, a human,

00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:43.140
apply a hash function,
a cryptographic means,

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:47.535
and get a unique identifier
for that individual.

00:15:47.535 --> 00:15:49.650
AUDIENCE: I have a
counter question to that.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.110
So let's say you
hash everything.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:55.520
I can have a counter feed
of like five things that can

00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.770
essentially be the same thing.

00:15:56.770 --> 00:15:58.853
And you'll just have five
different hashes for it.

00:15:58.853 --> 00:15:59.380
Right?

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:03.060
It will still have to come from
a non-blockchain source for you

00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.570
to be able to--

00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:05.910
AUDIENCE: Well, it's not things.

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:06.660
It's human beings.

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:07.450
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:11.280
But for you to be able
to hash one person,

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:14.490
you can still reproduce
five other fake people

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:16.873
and have five different
fake identities

00:16:16.873 --> 00:16:17.790
with a different hash.

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:20.160
AUDIENCE: So that's
the difficulty, right?

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.945
You can't actually-- if I
hash myself and I get a hash,

00:16:23.945 --> 00:16:25.320
you will have a
lot of difficulty

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.312
producing another human being.

00:16:27.312 --> 00:16:29.520
It's like finding the
collision in the hash function.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:32.400
You have a lot of difficulty
producing a human being that

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:33.870
has the same hash as mine.

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:35.912
Because the hash function
is collision resistant.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.820
And it's hard to come
up to clone me 100%.

00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:40.980
For example, my retina,
even if I give you

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.490
all the data behind my
retina and you have it,

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:47.520
it's very hard to produce
a retina in your own eye

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:49.870
that you can scan and pretend
to be me, for example.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.703
That's one way to think
of hashing somebody.

00:16:51.703 --> 00:16:52.880
You just scan the retina.

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.830
And even though you
know the full retina,

00:16:54.830 --> 00:16:57.330
it's of no use to you because
you have to put it in your eye

00:16:57.330 --> 00:16:58.800
and go there and get scanned.

00:16:58.800 --> 00:16:59.830
And it's like, OK, fine.

00:16:59.830 --> 00:17:03.087
Well, our medical
technology is not there yet.

00:17:03.087 --> 00:17:05.504
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE] And
then we're going to move on.

00:17:05.504 --> 00:17:07.230
AUDIENCE: I'm just going to
say, if you want to take it--

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.640
it's not even your
physical representation.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:09.140
Right?

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:11.730
Because you can change what
you are physically nowadays.

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:15.210
And so it's like what
you know, what you are,

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:17.880
and what you have, the
three things that you can

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.249
put into this hash function.

00:17:20.249 --> 00:17:23.260
AUDIENCE: Well, it should be--

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:24.158
it should be.

00:17:24.158 --> 00:17:24.700
You're right.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:25.783
It's not the whole of you.

00:17:25.783 --> 00:17:27.190
You have to do it
very carefully.

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.273
So the question is, how
do you [INAUDIBLE] person.

00:17:29.273 --> 00:17:32.055
Because if you go by weight,
let's say the hash function

00:17:32.055 --> 00:17:32.680
is your weight.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:33.388
Well, that's bad.

00:17:33.388 --> 00:17:34.930
Because you get collisions.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.520
So you have to do it
very carefully, for sure.

00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:39.770
GARY GENSLER: So, Eric, did
you have something to add?

00:17:39.770 --> 00:17:43.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
But actually,

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.840
the main point of your
elaboration is the biometrics

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.810
behind the whole--

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:53.550
because it's not the hashing
that's making this possible.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.760
It's the biometrics.

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.150
Because you have to
actually hash something.

00:17:58.150 --> 00:18:01.840
When you come from the
abstract construct of saying,

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:03.850
hash somebody, you're
actually saying,

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:06.660
you're hashing some
biometric attribute

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:09.895
that has to be unique
to get the hash.

00:18:09.895 --> 00:18:12.850
AUDIENCE: I'm sure hashing
a person is an abstraction

00:18:12.850 --> 00:18:14.643
for, let's say,
take a biometric,

00:18:14.643 --> 00:18:16.060
it's actually
collision resistant.

00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.110
AUDIENCE: The point, the
really important point,

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.142
it comes to biometrics.

00:18:20.142 --> 00:18:21.100
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:21.450
That's right.

00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:23.770
And then the question is,
well, biometrics get stolen.

00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:24.530
How do you deal with that?

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.230
Then you have to be
very careful with it.

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:27.360
There's nowadays,
you can actually,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:29.068
if you aren't careful,
it can get stolen.

00:18:29.068 --> 00:18:30.537
GARY GENSLER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:30.537 --> 00:18:31.120
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.320
So to Eric's point, I think
that's still an identifier.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.210
It's not really your identity.

00:18:37.210 --> 00:18:39.160
Because like you
guys are saying,

00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:43.620
you can replicate somebody's
retina, let's say,

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:46.510
1,000 years or 10 years
down line, I don't know.

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.260
AUDIENCE: Perhaps.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:47.680
That's right.

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.040
That's right.

00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:50.082
AUDIENCE: Or they replicate
somebody's fingertip.

00:18:50.082 --> 00:18:52.780
But that doesn't mean
that you're replicating

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.680
their entire identity.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.620
So I like the idea of
hash somebody's identity,

00:18:57.620 --> 00:18:59.210
hashing a person.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.570
But I don't think it's
just hashing their eye

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:02.830
or just hashing their--

00:19:02.830 --> 00:19:03.340
AUDIENCE: That's right.

00:19:03.340 --> 00:19:04.570
But I think you're
getting philosophical.

00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:06.028
I'm looking through
the perspective

00:19:06.028 --> 00:19:07.080
of a bank, a verifier.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.622
What does a bank
actually need to do?

00:19:08.622 --> 00:19:10.540
It just needs to map
everybody to some number.

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.430
And when you come back,
it needs to figure out

00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:14.260
which number you are or
if you're a new number.

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:15.130
That's all you need.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:16.453
And then, problem solved.

00:19:16.453 --> 00:19:18.370
And then by the way,
personal data attributes,

00:19:18.370 --> 00:19:19.952
you just link those
to those numbers.

00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:21.160
It's not a difficult problem.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:23.050
It's an orthogonal problem.

00:19:23.050 --> 00:19:24.320
You solve that [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.620
GARY GENSLER: So
let's agree that--

00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.840
what Alin is saying
is he's not talking

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:32.720
about our soul or
our unique identity.

00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:35.650
He's talking about something
that a verifier or a bank

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:36.650
might be able to do.

00:19:36.650 --> 00:19:40.280
And then you could say here's
7 billion people on the planet

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:40.780
now.

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.270
And there'll be 10 or
12 billion one day.

00:19:43.270 --> 00:19:44.890
But you could take
each one of them

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:49.390
and somehow have a unique
identifier, a hash function,

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:51.640
that has each of those.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.690
Don't do it off of DNA though.

00:19:54.690 --> 00:19:57.450
Because Eric and I,
you know, and hundreds

00:19:57.450 --> 00:19:59.250
of millions of others would--

00:19:59.250 --> 00:20:05.100
so DNA is not a unique
identifier for true identity.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:10.110
So the concepts of
identity for things

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.252
that I think about
sometimes, some of the papers

00:20:12.252 --> 00:20:12.960
were about three.

00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:18.450
But there's attributes, a claim,
a credential, an attestation.

00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:19.920
What would be an attribute?

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:23.803
Just any old attribute of a--

00:20:23.803 --> 00:20:24.745
anybody?

00:20:27.262 --> 00:20:28.197
AUDIENCE: Your retina.

00:20:28.197 --> 00:20:29.280
GARY GENSLER: Your retina.

00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.180
Or it could be your age,
address, citizenship, name.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.140
A claim is, my name is Gary.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.900
Or a claim might
be, I am so old.

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:44.440
Or I am a US citizen.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:51.670
Or a claim might even be, I
have $5,000 in my bank account.

00:20:51.670 --> 00:20:53.560
There are other forms of claims.

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.310
Or I do have a bank
account at Bank of America.

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:02.140
I don't think I have
$5,000 in it right now.

00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:03.790
No.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:08.330
A credential is what
we started with.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:13.300
I think James mentioned it, a
driver's license, an ID card,

00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.730
a utility bill sometimes.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.640
I mean there's hundreds
of forms of credentials.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:23.170
We think of the
governmental credentials.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.570
The history of credentials
is interesting.

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.730
The first tens of thousands
of years of human kind

00:21:30.730 --> 00:21:33.460
didn't have any.

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.410
And we started to have them.

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:42.430
Passports really aren't even
that old of an invention.

00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:46.150
In the 16th century, the King of
England had some pass boarding.

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.940
But it was so that
his citizens could be

00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:50.740
recognized in other countries.

00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.990
It was so that their
rights would be respected

00:21:52.990 --> 00:21:57.690
and somebody would
not be messed with.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:02.510
I'm under that sovereign,
don't mess with me.

00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:05.350
But in terms of a true
permitting system,

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:08.560
it was largely implemented
about 100 years ago.

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:10.660
Anywhere between 100
and 150 years ago.

00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:12.910
It's not that old a system.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:15.220
But it was all paperwork.

00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:17.260
And I don't know if
any of you have ever

00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:19.465
asked to see a grandparent's
or great grandparent's

00:22:19.465 --> 00:22:22.550
or an ancestor's passport
or those documents,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:23.500
if you have them.

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:26.170
But they're intensely paper.

00:22:26.170 --> 00:22:28.240
In fact, if they're from
the late 19th century,

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.690
there's no photographs.

00:22:29.690 --> 00:22:32.155
They started to have photographs
in the early 20th century.

00:22:35.730 --> 00:22:37.040
And so it's a big change.

00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:41.330
And the last 30 or 40 years
of digitisation of this

00:22:41.330 --> 00:22:45.020
has actually made it a
little harder, in some ways.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.190
I mean there's efficiencies.

00:22:46.190 --> 00:22:47.780
But it makes it harder.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:53.090
And then attestation is that
third party verifying it.

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.770
And that's what Alin
was talking about.

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:59.030
If somebody can verify your
identity, they're basically--

00:22:59.030 --> 00:22:59.810
I make a claim.

00:22:59.810 --> 00:23:01.280
My name's Gary.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.980
I might give a credential,
my passport to show it.

00:23:03.980 --> 00:23:05.570
The picture looks like me.

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:07.220
A human looks at it.

00:23:07.220 --> 00:23:08.900
Lines it up.

00:23:08.900 --> 00:23:10.220
Says all right.

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:13.730
You can enter the
country of Germany

00:23:13.730 --> 00:23:17.670
or wherever I'm traveling.

00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:19.810
They don't actually
know that I'm really--

00:23:19.810 --> 00:23:24.930
but they do some verification.

00:23:24.930 --> 00:23:28.350
So those are the
big kind of pieces.

00:23:28.350 --> 00:23:32.650
Identity and access management
systems, the functions--

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.770
and these are just
taken from a bunch

00:23:34.770 --> 00:23:44.290
of readings-- authentication
and then authorization.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.230
Authenticating that I
have the bank account.

00:23:47.230 --> 00:23:48.850
Authorization, I can use it.

00:23:48.850 --> 00:23:52.240
Or authentication
I'm a US citizen.

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:56.700
Authorization, I can come
into the country of Germany.

00:23:56.700 --> 00:24:04.870
So based upon some attribute,
somebody authorizes me.

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:07.060
Or something that
maybe some of you

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:12.190
have dealt with at some
stage of your life,

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:15.160
that first time you
went in and handed

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:20.034
a driver's license in so you
could take a drink at a bar.

00:24:20.034 --> 00:24:23.360
Let me make it tangible.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.530
That's like authenticating,
do you look like that person.

00:24:28.530 --> 00:24:31.060
And then who are the
parties in this system?

00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:36.420
Users, service providers,
identity providers.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.970
Anybody want to tell me
about this ecosystem at all?

00:24:42.442 --> 00:24:43.400
Alfa, you didn't write.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.300
You wrote last time.

00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:45.800
Tom.

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.133
AUDIENCE: Again, I didn't write.

00:24:47.133 --> 00:24:50.352
But the idea of identity
provider is interesting.

00:24:50.352 --> 00:24:51.810
It fits in our
conversation, right?

00:24:51.810 --> 00:24:55.360
If we're talking about your
identity being who you are,

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.750
it's really identity
verification provider.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:01.665
They're providing the documents.

00:25:01.665 --> 00:25:03.230
GARY GENSLER: I
think that's right.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:04.090
I mean, in a sense.

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:11.360
Though identity, in a
more philosophic way,

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.890
is who you are.

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.110
But yes, the
identity provider can

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:19.740
be somebody like the
state of New York

00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.730
or the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts,

00:25:22.730 --> 00:25:25.310
birth certificates, death
certificates, marriage

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:26.512
certificates.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:33.490
Attribute authorities, like
certificate authorities,

00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:42.850
are kind of a more
recent invention.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:46.210
I don't know that they
existed 100 or 200 years ago.

00:25:46.210 --> 00:25:50.160
But an attribute authority
says, these attributes,

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.940
we'll validate them.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:56.950
They're central authorities
that say, yes, this is correct.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.130
And certificate authorities are
particularly an invention of,

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:02.200
what, 40 years maybe.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.450
The internet, 30 years.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:08.500
AUDIENCE: I think the thesis
was an MIT thesis in 1976.

00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.610
GARY GENSLER: 1976
thesis at MIT.

00:26:10.610 --> 00:26:14.818
AUDIENCE: If I
remember correctly.

00:26:14.818 --> 00:26:16.360
GARY GENSLER: Did
anybody want to say

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:17.693
what a certificate authority is?

00:26:17.693 --> 00:26:19.930
Because they're in the
middle of all of that.

00:26:19.930 --> 00:26:23.370
By the way, every time that
you go to the internet today,

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:25.390
a certificate
authority is involved

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:30.580
in that transaction, probably
100 billion times a day

00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:31.440
around the globe.

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:36.850
Yeah, that's probably
the order of magnitude.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:38.650
Probably 100
billion times a day,

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.015
a certificate authority is used.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:45.430
Alin, you want to--

00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:46.636
AUDIENCE: Sure, yeah.

00:26:46.636 --> 00:26:48.270
GARY GENSLER:
Certificate authorities

00:26:48.270 --> 00:26:51.515
are how we access the
internet all day long.

00:26:51.515 --> 00:26:52.972
AUDIENCE: You want
an explanation

00:26:52.972 --> 00:26:54.180
for what they are on the web?

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:54.740
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:55.530
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:26:55.530 --> 00:26:57.415
So on the web, you have
a bunch of websites.

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:59.040
Let's say you have
facebook.com and you

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.630
want to visit it and
give it your password.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:03.540
So if you have evil
people like me,

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:06.090
I might set up a fake
server and pretend

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:08.670
to be facebook.com, mess
with the DNS records,

00:27:08.670 --> 00:27:10.500
get you to visit my server.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.768
When you type www.facebook.com,
you visit my server.

00:27:12.768 --> 00:27:13.560
But you can't tell.

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.010
GARY GENSLER: DNS is
Domain Name Server.

00:27:19.775 --> 00:27:21.150
AUDIENCE: But
anyway, the idea is

00:27:21.150 --> 00:27:22.640
that when you
actually do a look up

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.270
from facebook.com
from an IP address,

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:25.630
that's actually very insecure.

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:27.672
And attackers can mess
with that and redirect you

00:27:27.672 --> 00:27:28.770
to their servers.

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:31.603
And they might completely
replicate the Facebook page

00:27:31.603 --> 00:27:33.770
so you might think you're
interacting with Facebook.

00:27:33.770 --> 00:27:34.220
But you're not.

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:35.660
You're interacting with
an attacker website.

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.830
And you type in your
password and your user name,

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:39.000
and then the attacker steals it.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.740
And then he just redirects
you to the real Facebook

00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:42.680
and you won't notice
the attack at all.

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.722
Does that make sense?

00:27:43.722 --> 00:27:45.722
GARY GENSLER: And it all
happens in nanoseconds.

00:27:45.722 --> 00:27:46.870
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:48.930
And it's called the man
in the middle attack.

00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.420
So what you do is you use
public key cryptography

00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.590
to solve that problem.

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:55.030
You say, OK, let's give
each website a key pair.

00:27:55.030 --> 00:27:57.330
So facebook.com will have
a key pair, a secret key

00:27:57.330 --> 00:27:58.560
and a public key.

00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.300
So now, the question
is, well, there's

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.900
a public key for
facebook.com, but how

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.358
do you know you have the right
public key for facebook.com.

00:28:04.358 --> 00:28:07.680
Because an attacker could
also give you their public key

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:08.878
their fake facebook.com.

00:28:08.878 --> 00:28:10.920
So now, how do you
distinguish between those two?

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.920
That's where the certificate
authority comes in.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:16.800
So the certificate authority
signs these public keys.

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.380
And you have the public key
of the certificate authority.

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.600
You have a signature from
the certificate authority

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.250
on the public key
of facebook.com.

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.510
You're now ready to
trust that you're

00:28:24.510 --> 00:28:25.950
dealing with the
real facebook.com

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.110
and you can encrypt
your password

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:30.210
to facebook.com using
your public key.

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:31.710
There's a lot of
public keys around.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:32.630
I know.

00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:34.625
I'm not sure if
that made any sense.

00:28:34.625 --> 00:28:37.290
GARY GENSLER: So
we earlier learned

00:28:37.290 --> 00:28:40.350
about public key
and private keys

00:28:40.350 --> 00:28:43.080
as part of blockchain
technology.

00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:47.310
But know that when Satoshi
Nakamoto wrote that paper,

00:28:47.310 --> 00:28:53.340
she was just using
asymmetric cryptography,

00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:56.460
public-private key cryptography,
that had been invented really

00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.470
in the 1970s.

00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:00.450
And then it adopted,
as the internet

00:29:00.450 --> 00:29:06.920
came along, and took off and
had a lot of use in the 1990s

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:10.020
to secure the internet by 1996.

00:29:10.020 --> 00:29:14.120
And the way that the internet's
secured on TSL and SSL

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.390
and these various
ways it's secured

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:21.410
was public key-private key
cryptography, a full 12 years

00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:27.050
before Nakamoto wrote the paper,
but used for a different case.

00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:29.360
But Facebook has a public key.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.700
And all those public
keys of all the websites

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:36.220
that you visit every day,
there is a central authority

00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:37.600
called a certificate authority.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:40.360
There's actually a 100 plus
certificate authorities.

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:44.320
But certificate
authorities that say,

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:47.830
this is the Facebook public key.

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.740
So that when you go to your
Facebook or you go to Google

00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:56.440
or you go to shop on Amazon,
you know you're actually--

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.370
so that's a corporate or that's
another form of identity.

00:30:00.370 --> 00:30:04.630
It's not one with
soul, I would suggest.

00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:07.220
That's not a negative
thing about Facebook.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:10.053
I just don't think websites--

00:30:10.053 --> 00:30:11.970
but you all might have
a different philosophy.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.440
I didn't think
websites have soul.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.320
Brotish.

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:17.940
AUDIENCE: It's not clear
to me how, as a user,

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:19.780
I know that I'm going
to the right website.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.000
I understand certification
happens [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.840
But how do I know that I
have the right website.

00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.030
GARY GENSLER: I'll try
to do it in lay terms.

00:30:27.030 --> 00:30:28.470
And then you'll hit it.

00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:32.550
There's kind of a handoff that
when you send that signal,

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.470
you're trying to access--

00:30:35.470 --> 00:30:36.882
is it Facebook?

00:30:36.882 --> 00:30:37.965
You're accessing Facebook.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:44.040
They send you some information,
including their public key that

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:44.880
you're--

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.430
in essence, a
certificate authority

00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:47.880
is automatically checking.

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:50.747
But Alin will give you
the more technical.

00:30:50.747 --> 00:30:52.330
AUDIENCE: Let's use
a simpler example.

00:30:52.330 --> 00:30:54.210
Let's say you want to
go to New York Times

00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.070
and you want to read a
headline that says something

00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:58.153
about some important things,
like tomorrow there's

00:30:58.153 --> 00:31:00.057
going to be a snow storm.

00:31:00.057 --> 00:31:01.890
Obviously you want to
know if you're dealing

00:31:01.890 --> 00:31:03.015
with the authentic website.

00:31:03.015 --> 00:31:05.012
That seems to me the problem.

00:31:05.012 --> 00:31:06.220
So how do you deal with that?

00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:08.940
Well, remember the New York
Times will have a public key.

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:11.040
It will have a
corresponding secret key.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:13.732
So you visit their website.

00:31:13.732 --> 00:31:15.690
It turns out that when
you download the website

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:17.670
from the New York Times
with that announcement

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:19.800
about the snow storm,
that's actually signed

00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.990
with their secret key to verify
the website that you get.

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:27.070
You verify it against
their public key.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:29.070
And you know that only
they know the secret key.

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:31.695
So only they could have offered
that information and signed it.

00:31:31.695 --> 00:31:34.320
So then you know you're
dealing with the right website.

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.583
It's literally the New
York Times sends you

00:31:36.583 --> 00:31:39.000
a signature over every piece
of information they send you.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.350
And you verify it
against their public key,

00:31:40.350 --> 00:31:42.410
which in turn you verified it
from a certificate authority.

00:31:42.410 --> 00:31:44.743
GARY GENSLER: If you remember
the little bit of broccoli

00:31:44.743 --> 00:31:51.360
we did earlier this year,
that asymmetric cryptography

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.190
with a public key
and a private key

00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:56.890
also has digital signatures.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.240
So you have, now, two things.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:01.770
Let's go back to Bitcoin.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:05.470
In Bitcoin transactions,
you have a public key.

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:08.890
And then somebody
signs a transaction.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.370
And the math behind it,
the cryptography behind it,

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:15.280
is a signature and
a public key that

00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:18.740
come from the same private key.

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.990
There's a way to do a
function to check that they

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:24.390
came from the same private key.

00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:28.320
And the heart and soul of
what was invented in the 1970s

00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:30.900
was not just that there's a
public key and a private key,

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.230
but also that you can
digitally sign it.

00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:36.060
And then when the
digital signature

00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:40.790
is compared to the
public key, it's

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:44.660
unique if they came from
the same private key.

00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:46.280
So going back to
the New York Times,

00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.490
the New York Times you have
both their public key and then

00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:52.310
each headline, each
piece of information

00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:54.900
has a digital signature.

00:32:54.900 --> 00:32:58.290
And of course, you do
have a centralization,

00:32:58.290 --> 00:33:00.990
a lot of centralization,
on the internet related

00:33:00.990 --> 00:33:03.550
to these certificate
authorities.

00:33:03.550 --> 00:33:04.050
Eric.

00:33:04.050 --> 00:33:06.360
AUDIENCE: Just a point
maybe to clarify,

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.410
this is performed
at a protocol level.

00:33:08.410 --> 00:33:12.980
That is not the user witnessing
any of these interactions.

00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:19.120
It's done at the top of the
TCP ICP stack, this TLS, which

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:27.210
is the security protocol that
works with HTTP, which is web.

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:30.350
And this is where you
find that this little lock

00:33:30.350 --> 00:33:33.190
in the browser that's
guaranteeing that that's

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:34.560
the website you're visiting.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:39.140
Because the whole
exchange of information

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.550
that includes the public
key from the website

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:45.510
and the verification
is done by the browser.

00:33:45.510 --> 00:33:47.262
You don't do
anything interactive.

00:33:47.262 --> 00:33:48.720
GARY GENSLER: We
don't do anything.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.340
That little lock
has that meaning.

00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:52.790
And you could actually see
what certificate authority.

00:33:52.790 --> 00:33:56.700
I only pause on that to
pause not only to tie back

00:33:56.700 --> 00:33:59.700
earlier conversations about
public and private key,

00:33:59.700 --> 00:34:02.760
but the whole internet is
reliant on these certificate

00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:03.810
authorities.

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:06.540
And blockchain
technology might be a way

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:11.300
to step around and
have a new paradigm.

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:11.800
Kelly.

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:13.984
AUDIENCE: So for a
contextual example,

00:34:13.984 --> 00:34:17.800
say I'm trying to access my
brokerage account or whatever.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.620
And say I forgot my password.

00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:22.409
Or every month, they want
you to replace this or that

00:34:22.409 --> 00:34:25.110
to protect your account.

00:34:25.110 --> 00:34:29.310
How does a person interact with
these various parties going

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:33.247
through that process when it's
trying to verify that it's you

00:34:33.247 --> 00:34:35.330
gaining access?

00:34:35.330 --> 00:34:38.840
What are the points
of contact for those?

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.284
GARY GENSLER: There
is an initial layer,

00:34:41.284 --> 00:34:42.659
which we were just
talking about,

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:45.750
that you're actually
dealing with you're--

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:46.350
I don't know.

00:34:46.350 --> 00:34:47.570
I'm going to make it up.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:48.585
DE Shaw.

00:34:48.585 --> 00:34:50.280
Or no, that's a hedge fund.

00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:51.420
With--

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:54.221
AUDIENCE: Bank of America.

00:34:54.221 --> 00:34:55.650
GARY GENSLER: Bank of America.

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:56.317
Fine.

00:34:56.317 --> 00:34:57.900
That you're really
dealing-- so that's

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.610
what we were talking about that.

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:01.012
They are Bank of America.

00:35:01.012 --> 00:35:02.970
And you're really dealing
with Bank of America.

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:05.010
And you don't even
participate in that.

00:35:05.010 --> 00:35:07.440
But then there's another
layer that if you've

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.450
forgotten your
password, they're going

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:16.590
to ask you a bunch of questions,
like the usual questions

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.130
about who was your
first pet and who

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:20.950
was your first significant
other and things like that.

00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:24.671
But at some point in time,
they'll freeze you out.

00:35:24.671 --> 00:35:26.528
AUDIENCE: That's
the service provider

00:35:26.528 --> 00:35:27.570
that you registered with.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:29.346
That's Bank of America.

00:35:29.346 --> 00:35:31.320
GARY GENSLER: That's
Bank of America

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.630
has their anti-fraud provisions.

00:35:33.630 --> 00:35:35.430
What we were just
talking about is really

00:35:35.430 --> 00:35:38.670
at the internet browser.

00:35:38.670 --> 00:35:40.770
And in essence,
Facebook is the one

00:35:40.770 --> 00:35:44.190
that's trying to be identified.

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:48.990
100 billion times a day,
some human around the globe

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:50.517
is trying to be
protected, that they

00:35:50.517 --> 00:35:52.350
know they're dealing
with the right identity

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.220
on the other side.

00:35:53.220 --> 00:35:54.970
We were talking
about human identity.

00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.750
There's also the
identity of the websites.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:01.060
And that's what we were
just chatting about.

00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.050
Let me move on.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:04.680
And then if I've
left you confused,

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:06.430
because you were asking
about what happens

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:07.653
if you forgot your password--

00:36:07.653 --> 00:36:08.320
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:12.555
Like how do they verify
you, not you verifying them.

00:36:12.555 --> 00:36:14.995
GARY GENSLER: How
did they verify you?

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:21.100
I would contend it's still
kind of a little archaic.

00:36:21.100 --> 00:36:25.540
I mean, it's a little bit
like if you forgot your--

00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:28.270
a couple of times you use
a username and password,

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:30.280
and of course if you
have dual authentication,

00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:34.660
they might send you a notice
to another text message

00:36:34.660 --> 00:36:35.907
or something.

00:36:35.907 --> 00:36:37.490
But if you've forgotten
your password,

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.890
then it's literally backdoor
sort of saying, well,

00:36:40.890 --> 00:36:42.260
to remember your question.

00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.900
I never remember the questions.

00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:49.540
I mean who is your first
friend in elementary school?

00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:53.490
What was the first
car you drove?

00:36:53.490 --> 00:36:56.670
It's crude.

00:36:56.670 --> 00:36:59.550
And then they usually freeze
you out for fraud protection

00:36:59.550 --> 00:37:03.430
after two or three
times of trying that.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:05.170
And almost always,
there's something

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:07.615
where they can send it
to you another place.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:15.440
Identity management,
some of the pain points.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:16.910
What are we trying to solve?

00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:22.270
And why would blockchain
technology maybe help us out?

00:37:22.270 --> 00:37:25.150
Privacy and security
is a big one.

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:32.970
There are a lot of
thefts, identity theft.

00:37:32.970 --> 00:37:36.660
How many people are in the room
have had their credit card--

00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.660
this year, in 2018,
we're 11 months in--

00:37:39.660 --> 00:37:41.790
have had their credit
card have to be replaced

00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:46.090
because the bank got in touch
and said it's compromised?

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:47.880
Only about 20% of us.

00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:50.530
I would have thought it
was going to be more.

00:37:50.530 --> 00:37:56.670
I feel like I get one of those
calls every 18 to 24 months.

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:57.990
Maybe I shop too much.

00:37:57.990 --> 00:38:00.530
Or my daughters are
using my card too much.

00:38:00.530 --> 00:38:03.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] big
enough to be a target.

00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:06.962
Student banks tend
to be negative.

00:38:06.962 --> 00:38:10.170
GARY GENSLER: You
think that's it?

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:14.910
I just assume that some
merchant has been hacked again.

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:17.880
I mean, every time a
merchant loses 1 million,

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.080
or 100,000, or 50
million accounts,

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:27.260
then the banking system needs
to send out those notices.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:31.820
I chair a commission, Financial
Consumer Protection Commission

00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:32.780
of Maryland.

00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.510
And the credit union
advocates in Maryland

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:41.590
came to our commission and
said, we need some help.

00:38:41.590 --> 00:38:44.660
We banks and credit unions
have to protect a lot of data.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:47.410
But every time a
merchant loses data,

00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:49.360
it's us credit
unions and banks that

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.210
have to replace all
the credit cards.

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:54.520
And they feel there's
an asymmetry, commercial

00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.900
asymmetry, that the
banking sector is bearing

00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:04.400
the brunt of other merchant's,
non-financial sectors, data

00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.590
breaches.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:08.150
And should the state of
Maryland-- this is a live

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:10.280
issue actually in front
of our commission.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:12.350
Should the state of
Maryland change its laws

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.310
to put higher cybersecurity
responsibilities

00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:19.580
on non-financial sector actors?

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:21.470
And the financial
sector would say, yeah,

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.980
that kind of feels you'd be
leveling the playing field.

00:39:24.980 --> 00:39:26.570
And the merchants
are saying, you

00:39:26.570 --> 00:39:29.950
can't do that on every
grocery store and bar.

00:39:29.950 --> 00:39:36.043
It seems like it's a
little out of sync.

00:39:36.043 --> 00:39:37.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was going to say

00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:41.700
that credit card theft like this
is a perfect application public

00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:42.950
key cryptography.

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:47.870
The [INAUDIBLE] don't give
out your credit card number

00:39:47.870 --> 00:39:48.693
to these folks.

00:39:48.693 --> 00:39:50.360
Your credit card
should have a key pair.

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:52.235
It should have a secret
key and a public key.

00:39:52.235 --> 00:39:54.220
And you give your
public key to Amazon.

00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.820
And then how do you pay Amazon?

00:39:55.820 --> 00:39:57.930
Well, you sign with your secret
key that's on your credit card.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.210
So nobody knows your secret key.

00:39:59.210 --> 00:40:00.170
It's on your damn card.

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:01.550
Never lose that card.

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.720
And problem solved.

00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.215
They can steal as many
public keys as they want.

00:40:05.215 --> 00:40:05.840
Problem solved.

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.070
Same thing with the SSN.

00:40:07.070 --> 00:40:08.650
Why would you share that--

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:10.200
GARY GENSLER: I
disclosed to you.

00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:12.092
He became a maximalist, almost.

00:40:12.092 --> 00:40:14.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I'm
talking about public crypto

00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:15.970
here, not without consensus.

00:40:15.970 --> 00:40:18.150
Although, consensus can
be a very important part

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:18.560
of all of this.

00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.120
GARY GENSLER: Almost.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:19.620
Almost.

00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:20.200
All right.

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.740
So let me just hit.

00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:24.860
So in terms of the
big pain points--

00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.260
privacy and security, a
bunch of identity theft,

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.900
forged credentials,
back to the passport

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:31.610
or the driver's
license or the credit

00:40:31.610 --> 00:40:36.530
card, a forged credential,
whatever that is.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:40.640
And of course, just how do we
update our personal identity

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.670
for any time we move?

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.830
And this term PII
is three letters

00:40:45.830 --> 00:40:46.880
you'll learn in business.

00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:49.970
Because at some point in time
you'll be running a business

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.420
and somebody will be coming
in, your chief of information

00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.610
officer, and say,
we've had a breach.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.190
And unfortunately we
broke some laws, too.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:02.330
Because in the US and
in other countries GDPR,

00:41:02.330 --> 00:41:03.740
you have to protect
certain data.

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:05.990
And it's usually called PPI.

00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:09.890
It's usually the bucket of
data you need to protect.

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:13.790
But every time you update your
personal information, how do

00:41:13.790 --> 00:41:18.185
you how do you keep it updated?

00:41:18.185 --> 00:41:19.310
Ross, was there a question?

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:24.145
AUDIENCE: I just had a question
back on your Maryland example.

00:41:24.145 --> 00:41:25.520
I make the
assumption, maybe it's

00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:31.332
wrong, that if your
commission allows the banks--

00:41:31.332 --> 00:41:32.870
or passes that regulation--

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:35.180
GARY GENSLER: We're
just an advisory.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.152
But if we recommend to
the General Assembly.

00:41:37.152 --> 00:41:39.110
AUDIENCE: That the banks
are not going to lower

00:41:39.110 --> 00:41:40.910
their fee to the merchants.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:44.840
So what's the dollar number
that they're trying to push?

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.200
In other words, I'm trying
to size the pain point.

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:50.210
What's the amount of
cost to those banks

00:41:50.210 --> 00:41:53.000
that they're trying to
move to the merchants

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.300
and thus drop from the
bank's bottom line?

00:41:56.300 --> 00:41:57.800
GARY GENSLER: I
don't have a figure.

00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.883
It's a very good question.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:08.640
What we know is that the overall
statistics on fraud and credit

00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:13.620
card is, I think, high
teens basis points.

00:42:13.620 --> 00:42:18.160
I can't remember, 15 or 18
basis points but less than 20.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.030
And it's more than 10.

00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:25.310
So Visa Network charges
270 basis points or so.

00:42:25.310 --> 00:42:29.270
And the fraud part of it's
15 or 18 basis points.

00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:31.636
AUDIENCE: And the issuing
bank gets how much of the 275?

00:42:31.636 --> 00:42:34.465
GARY GENSLER: 200 or so.

00:42:34.465 --> 00:42:35.090
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:35.090 --> 00:42:36.965
So they want to [INAUDIBLE]
whatever that is.

00:42:36.965 --> 00:42:39.050
GARY GENSLER: But I don't know--

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.860
and this is particularly
credit unions are coming to us

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.790
and saying there's an
externality, the merchants,

00:42:47.790 --> 00:42:48.520
the gas stations.

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.930
All right.

00:42:51.930 --> 00:42:53.950
So you're saying, I
know which way you

00:42:53.950 --> 00:42:55.670
would vote on our commission.

00:42:58.930 --> 00:43:02.610
So what's going on a little
bit about data breaches?

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:05.760
I just tried to sort
of list anything

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.350
over 100 million customers.

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:10.080
But then I had to put Facebook
in because it was 50 million.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:14.745
But these are just like a dozen
or so really big data breaches.

00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.920
There are so many data
breaches in 2018 alone

00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.230
that you couldn't list
them on a page like this.

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:26.950
This is the last five years of
100 million people or more data

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:28.300
breaches.

00:43:28.300 --> 00:43:30.810
So there's a problem
here in cyber secure.

00:43:30.810 --> 00:43:31.810
And this is just the US.

00:43:34.732 --> 00:43:37.600
Brotish, didn't
the Indian system--

00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:40.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
more than a billion.

00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:43.840
GARY GENSLER: 1.1
billion people's IDs

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.390
were hacked in India.

00:43:47.390 --> 00:43:49.420
It was announced in
January of this year.

00:43:53.770 --> 00:43:57.007
And so, it's a lot going on.

00:43:57.007 --> 00:43:58.590
And every once in a
while, politically

00:43:58.590 --> 00:44:02.850
it captures the attention
of particularly Equifax did,

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.470
Facebook does.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:07.570
Wells Fargo, I think the
breach was 3 million.

00:44:07.570 --> 00:44:10.420
It's not even on this.

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:16.080
It wouldn't get to
the 50th page by size.

00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:18.540
But Wells Fargo had
other issues that was

00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:20.455
capturing the public attention.

00:44:20.455 --> 00:44:20.955
Kelly.

00:44:20.955 --> 00:44:22.320
AUDIENCE: Just taking
the Marriott one

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:24.940
as an example, that's been the
most recent one in the news,

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:25.890
I think.

00:44:25.890 --> 00:44:28.680
It's so costly to
these corporations.

00:44:28.680 --> 00:44:30.180
I think Marriott
even said that they

00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:34.785
would pay the fee to replace
passports for those affected.

00:44:37.410 --> 00:44:39.600
I mean, maybe it's a drop
in the bucket for them.

00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:45.300
But in terms of the
value in pain points,

00:44:45.300 --> 00:44:49.327
sort of like you were
talking about, it's a lot.

00:44:49.327 --> 00:44:50.410
GARY GENSLER: It is a lot.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:55.050
But one of the challenges that
blockchain technology solutions

00:44:55.050 --> 00:44:56.250
is adoption.

00:44:56.250 --> 00:45:02.800
How do you get Marriott to
contribute to a new system

00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:07.060
if you come up with a really
clever, creative, new system?

00:45:07.060 --> 00:45:10.390
Because there are so many
thousands of merchants

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:15.080
that are trying to deal with
their cybersecurity risk.

00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:19.390
And Marriott, all of a
sudden, has all these costs.

00:45:19.390 --> 00:45:23.260
But how you get them involved in
your new blockchain technology

00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:26.800
solution, I think it's just
an adoption issue, which

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:29.320
somebody might solve.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.390
Or as Ross says,
well, wait a minute.

00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:34.608
If the banks were to
just [INAUDIBLE] right?

00:45:34.608 --> 00:45:36.150
AUDIENCE: If they
want to cut the fee

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:38.101
and let everybody
else-- then that's fine.

00:45:38.101 --> 00:45:42.237
But the merchants have
no bargaining power.

00:45:42.237 --> 00:45:43.320
GARY GENSLER: That's true.

00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:45.382
AUDIENCE: So they cut the fee.

00:45:45.382 --> 00:45:48.660
GARY GENSLER: So a couple
of state identity projects.

00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:50.670
Estonia has e-identity.

00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:55.110
They started in 2002, well
before blockchain technology.

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:59.760
And it's run on a software
called X-Road software.

00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.390
And while some folks
might think of Estonia

00:46:03.390 --> 00:46:08.335
as a blockchain friendly
nation, does anybody

00:46:08.335 --> 00:46:10.710
want to take a guess whether
this software has blockchain

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:13.720
technology?

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:15.550
What's the consensus?

00:46:15.550 --> 00:46:16.060
No.

00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:18.640
It's not.

00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.090
That doesn't mean
it doesn't work.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:26.410
But they've sort of
wrapped themselves

00:46:26.410 --> 00:46:29.440
in this sort of spirit of
we're a blockchain nation.

00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:33.280
And they also have e-health
records and many other records

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.380
that are going online.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:40.810
And it may be, at some
level, inspired by that.

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:46.770
They have 1.3 million
people in Estonia.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:50.460
I think a bigger state
actor in the challenge--

00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.580
sorry, Brotish-- is Aadhaar.

00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.130
So there's a national
identification system.

00:46:56.130 --> 00:47:00.630
And it was promoted really for
inclusion, financial inclusion,

00:47:00.630 --> 00:47:05.670
and a way to get government
assistance and welfare

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:10.260
to hundreds of millions of poor.

00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:12.270
India at the time that
it was rolled out,

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:17.340
well over half of India did not
have a banking account at all.

00:47:17.340 --> 00:47:21.750
12 digit ID and biometrics,
being fingerprint and iris

00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:26.040
scan, I think they would deal
with the identical twin issue.

00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:34.260
I think, from my little example
that my twin brother Rob's

00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:37.710
finger didn't open my iPhone.

00:47:37.710 --> 00:47:39.250
But there's been
a lot of problems.

00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:41.610
And that's not a
blockchain project either.

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:46.140
But my read of it is Aadhaar--

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:48.000
and maybe Brotish
has some views--

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:50.850
has done some very
positive things in India.

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:55.110
But it's also come with
some very scary things.

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:57.600
Brotish.

00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.210
AUDIENCE: It's a quick nugget
of information about Aadhaar.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:03.180
It was the fastest
system in the world

00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.700
to reach 1 billion users,
faster than Facebook

00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.890
or any other online platform.

00:48:08.890 --> 00:48:12.390
And [INAUDIBLE] optional, I mean
it was not a mandatory system

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:13.560
for people to get it.

00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:14.660
It was optional system.

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:17.200
But it was the fastest
one to reach 1 billion.

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.170
GARY GENSLER: But it's optional.

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.180
But you can't get your
government assistance

00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:22.830
any longer if you're
not in it, right?

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:24.360
AUDIENCE: It's not like that.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.910
So actually, there has been
some government efforts

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:28.410
to make it that way.

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.900
But then the court actually
rejected those proposals.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:33.930
So they said that you cannot
make it mandatory to make

00:48:33.930 --> 00:48:36.360
people receive
benefits based on this.

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:39.370
So whoever has that,
they might have some ease

00:48:39.370 --> 00:48:40.840
of obtaining those benefits.

00:48:40.840 --> 00:48:42.780
But it's not like without it,
you cannot get [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:44.822
GARY GENSLER: So Brotish
is saying it accurately.

00:48:44.822 --> 00:48:48.750
But the court only ruled that
this year during 2018 I think.

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:51.383
And for a while, hundreds
of millions of people

00:48:51.383 --> 00:48:53.550
thought that's the only way
I can get my assistance.

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:56.610
But the 12 digit ID
and the biometrics

00:48:56.610 --> 00:49:00.690
has produced a system where,
along with a payment system

00:49:00.690 --> 00:49:03.480
where you can do a QR
code right on your iPhone

00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:08.350
and get goods and services,
and it's pretty efficient.

00:49:08.350 --> 00:49:11.660
But it's one national system.

00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:15.230
One national system and there's
been a lot of challenges.

00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:19.250
Not just the hack, but also
some mistakes sometimes.

00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:21.230
And based on those
mistakes, people

00:49:21.230 --> 00:49:24.190
feel like they've
lost their identity.

00:49:24.190 --> 00:49:26.440
I mean, they're still
this human that they are.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.570
But they've lost it in
a governmental sense.

00:49:28.570 --> 00:49:31.270
And thus they've stopped
getting their assistance.

00:49:31.270 --> 00:49:33.760
And there's occasionally
reports of suicides,

00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:36.040
and reports of deaths,
and things like that

00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.870
where people are no
longer recognized

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:41.440
in the system because
of their Aadhaar ID.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:43.870
So there's a lot
of public debate

00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:50.920
in India about the net benefit
versus some of the costs.

00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:55.240
Self-sovereign identity,
four things I think about.

00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:01.180
People and entities
control their identities

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:02.620
more than we have now.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.350
This is a concept.

00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:08.770
We have direct access
without some intermediary.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:14.840
Our identity is transportable.

00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:19.530
But not our human identity, but
the attributes of our identity.

00:50:19.530 --> 00:50:22.370
So I use the term
more loosely here.

00:50:22.370 --> 00:50:26.900
And then, it's widely
usable or interoperable.

00:50:26.900 --> 00:50:29.320
Self-sovereign
identity-- what's that?

00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:32.080
AUDIENCE: I was just
thinking [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.000
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.270
I kind of remembered
that back and forth.

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:43.830
Self-sovereign identity does not
rely on blockchain technology.

00:50:43.830 --> 00:50:48.650
It's a concept in a debate about
should we go back to something

00:50:48.650 --> 00:50:51.380
that we, in a sense, had in
the 19th century and even

00:50:51.380 --> 00:50:56.360
early 20th century that we
could walk into any store

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.300
and there might be other
forms of censorship.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:02.570
There are certainly many
prejudices and racism

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:04.610
and all sorts of challenges.

00:51:04.610 --> 00:51:07.970
But we could walk in
without a document.

00:51:07.970 --> 00:51:10.610
We weren't walking in.

00:51:10.610 --> 00:51:13.040
We might have some gold,
some money in our pocket.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.310
They would take the gold
coin or the silver coin.

00:51:16.310 --> 00:51:22.160
Self-sovereign identity is
also thinking about can we

00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:26.960
have the individual hold
their credentials as we

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.390
held a physical
passport but hold it

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:31.860
in a wallet in some way.

00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:32.663
Ross.

00:51:32.663 --> 00:51:36.980
AUDIENCE: Just your example
of the 19th century ties

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.350
into the question
that I had, which

00:51:39.350 --> 00:51:43.880
is doesn't this only work if you
also have a decentralized money

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:44.380
system.

00:51:44.380 --> 00:51:45.980
Like go to your example.

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:47.810
Only reason that works
is because people

00:51:47.810 --> 00:51:50.280
could go in and pay with a
completely anonymous form

00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:52.280
of money.

00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:54.170
Unless you have a
real broad, say,

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:58.190
Bitcoin distributive
system, your bank

00:51:58.190 --> 00:52:00.300
will require you to waive this.

00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:02.630
When you sign up
for a bank account,

00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:04.800
you will have to waive this.

00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:07.435
And it's gone.

00:52:07.435 --> 00:52:08.060
They just will.

00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:12.170
GARY GENSLER: So Ross is
raising, well, will this even

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:18.320
work unless you have a truly
decentralized money system.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:21.420
I don't think it's reliant on
a decentralized money system.

00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:24.200
I can see your point that it's
benefited by a decentralized.

00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.420
AUDIENCE: Any commercial
transaction you have,

00:52:26.420 --> 00:52:27.610
the counterparty--

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:30.740
Facebook will make you waive.

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:35.730
Because they want
the information.

00:52:35.730 --> 00:52:38.930
And Google, that's right
you could cut yourself off

00:52:38.930 --> 00:52:39.980
from all those things.

00:52:39.980 --> 00:52:42.230
But they'll just make it as
part of the contract, part

00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:44.090
of the access, that you waive.

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:45.830
GARY GENSLER: So
self-sovereign identity,

00:52:45.830 --> 00:52:50.510
concept that all of us humans
could control our identity, not

00:52:50.510 --> 00:52:53.690
just our birth and our
nationality, but maybe even

00:52:53.690 --> 00:52:58.910
our digital footprint,
our spending patterns,

00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:00.170
and so forth.

00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:02.780
And Ross is raising, well,
maybe Facebook and Google

00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:05.930
wouldn't transact with us
as a commercial reality.

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:10.490
You're saying their market
power, they might cut us out.

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.320
I think some might try.

00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.520
And that will be--

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.100
this hasn't been really adopted,
self-sovereign identity.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:17.330
AUDIENCE: Hell of
a question for you

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:18.622
Consumer Protection Commission.

00:53:18.622 --> 00:53:19.480
GARY GENSLER: Yeah.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:24.380
Maryland probably won't be able
to weigh into that too much.

00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:29.690
The benefits of taking identity
access management systems

00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:35.170
onto the blockchain technology,
and eight or 10 of you

00:53:35.170 --> 00:53:36.310
wrote papers on this.

00:53:36.310 --> 00:53:40.360
Does anybody want
to comment on--

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.860
this is like, my summary,
some of the benefits.

00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.820
You can address verification
costs and fraud.

00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:51.610
You could potentially lower
some of the cost and fraud.

00:53:51.610 --> 00:53:54.120
I think you can
trace provenance.

00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:58.090
You deal with
censorship and so forth.

00:53:58.090 --> 00:54:02.530
And truly, I think you
can help on privacy.

00:54:02.530 --> 00:54:03.840
But the challenge is--

00:54:06.910 --> 00:54:10.690
the real challenge
is that if you're

00:54:10.690 --> 00:54:18.220
storing personal identifiable
information on a blockchain,

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:20.200
blockchain technology
works by distributing

00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.170
the data to all the nodes.

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:26.650
And so the initial write ups,
three and four and five years

00:54:26.650 --> 00:54:31.150
ago, were, like, well, could
you put self-sovereign identity

00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:32.920
in essence in a
blockchain and store it?

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:34.295
And everybody
started to say, no.

00:54:34.295 --> 00:54:36.220
You really can't do that.

00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:42.460
Because you're not going to put
all my personal stuff on 10,000

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.720
nodes.

00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:47.320
AUDIENCE: So I mean, the
first benefit there, I think,

00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:50.200
should be prevent
identity theft.

00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:53.210
Because the main security
goal of any identity scheme,

00:54:53.210 --> 00:54:54.850
including the one
I described, is

00:54:54.850 --> 00:54:56.490
you want to prevent
identity theft,

00:54:56.490 --> 00:54:57.720
to prevent impersonation--

00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:58.720
GARY GENSLER: I'm sorry.

00:54:58.720 --> 00:54:59.360
I'm going back.

00:54:59.360 --> 00:55:04.283
I just chose not to
read through this page.

00:55:04.283 --> 00:55:05.200
I'm agreeing with you.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:10.895
I mean, these are the pain
points it would all address.

00:55:10.895 --> 00:55:12.330
AUDIENCE: And in
general, I think,

00:55:12.330 --> 00:55:15.090
when you think
about identity, you

00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:16.755
have to look at it
through that lens.

00:55:16.755 --> 00:55:18.630
Because what else is
identity for if it's not

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.150
for preventing people to
claim they're someone else?

00:55:21.150 --> 00:55:22.980
That's what an
identity scheme does.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:25.620
If your scheme doesn't address
that fundamental problem--

00:55:25.620 --> 00:55:28.550
like by the way, all of
these startups don't.

00:55:28.550 --> 00:55:30.330
Because SSN numbers
are still out there

00:55:30.330 --> 00:55:31.360
and require [INAUDIBLE].

00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:32.220
So as long as that's--

00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.450
GARY GENSLER: Social
Security Numbers.

00:55:33.450 --> 00:55:34.075
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:34.075 --> 00:55:36.960
Say goodbye to prevent
identity theft.

00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.227
What are you doing then?

00:55:39.227 --> 00:55:41.310
GARY GENSLER: I think,
I'll go here and then Hugo.

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:41.935
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:55:41.935 --> 00:55:45.330
And something that was not very
much addressed in the readings,

00:55:45.330 --> 00:55:48.660
I thought, was also the fact
that if you used a blockchain

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.820
technology, so evidently not.

00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:51.810
It's immutable.

00:55:51.810 --> 00:55:54.220
So it's often seen
as a good thing.

00:55:54.220 --> 00:55:57.030
But here in this case, normally,
like for example in Europe,

00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:59.400
normally in the
internet, you can

00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:02.300
request to delete
information you have

00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:06.840
if Google has a link which
mentions you for instance.

00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:09.720
But here, you wouldn't
be able to do it.

00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.430
Because the
information is there.

00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:14.850
If someone steals or even
if you want it deleted it,

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:18.240
somehow you can't
because it's immutable.

00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.330
So how can we deal with this?

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:23.270
GARY GENSLER: So you're
raising a point that in Europe

00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:27.290
under the new privacy
law, the GDPR,

00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:31.270
you have a right to be forgotten
or right to be deleted.

00:56:31.270 --> 00:56:35.160
And so how can blockchain
technology interact and work

00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:38.370
within that framework?

00:56:38.370 --> 00:56:43.900
If your actual information
is on the blockchain,

00:56:43.900 --> 00:56:44.810
I think you're right.

00:56:44.810 --> 00:56:46.510
I think it's very hard.

00:56:46.510 --> 00:56:49.870
But I do think there are
solutions if it's just

00:56:49.870 --> 00:56:51.880
a hash of your
information that's

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:53.480
being stored on the blockchain.

00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.510
AUDIENCE: Yes, but
they were mentioning

00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:58.160
in the reading as
well the fact that you

00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.390
can store all the data,
basically, of the blockchain.

00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:03.220
And then when you
transfer it, you just

00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.435
say like as a certification, oh,
yeah, this is my information.

00:57:06.435 --> 00:57:07.060
And it is true.

00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.880
You can verify it is true.

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:10.190
But you cannot have like--

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:12.190
GARY GENSLER: The
actual information

00:57:12.190 --> 00:57:15.805
on a distributed network.

00:57:15.805 --> 00:57:17.043
Kelly.

00:57:17.043 --> 00:57:19.210
AUDIENCE: I think that's a
really interesting point.

00:57:19.210 --> 00:57:21.640
One of the sort of
use cases I think of

00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:23.262
goes back to the
original attributes

00:57:23.262 --> 00:57:24.220
you were talking about.

00:57:24.220 --> 00:57:27.390
So for example, what
about citizenship?

00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.460
If in your digital
identity it says

00:57:33.460 --> 00:57:36.700
you're a United States
citizen and that changes,

00:57:36.700 --> 00:57:42.280
can that be changed if it's
immutable, A. And then B, what

00:57:42.280 --> 00:57:47.520
about those privacy issues?

00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:52.420
For people that do
not have, maybe it's

00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:55.380
not a fully verifiable
citizenship,

00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:58.140
then we have a whole host
of problems there as well.

00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:00.870
GARY GENSLER: So I think
you raise a good question.

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:05.460
But this is one of the
challenges of any identity

00:58:05.460 --> 00:58:06.140
database.

00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:10.290
But it's also a challenge of a
money database called Bitcoin.

00:58:10.290 --> 00:58:12.780
You have ownership today.

00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:16.560
And tomorrow you might
no longer have the coin.

00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:22.980
Today, you might live
in Massachusetts.

00:58:22.980 --> 00:58:26.010
But a year from now when
you get your fancy job

00:58:26.010 --> 00:58:28.470
and wherever you
are, you might not

00:58:28.470 --> 00:58:30.330
live in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:34.620
So I don't think it's
just citizenship.

00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.600
It's just the
updating the records

00:58:36.600 --> 00:58:41.490
and the attributes, that
you no longer can vote here,

00:58:41.490 --> 00:58:43.075
can no longer--

00:58:43.075 --> 00:58:44.950
AUDIENCE: It just goes
back to the trade offs

00:58:44.950 --> 00:58:46.950
that we were originally
talking about.

00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:48.383
There's a lot of--

00:58:48.383 --> 00:58:49.800
it certainly helps
a lot of things

00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.165
like preventing identity theft.

00:58:51.165 --> 00:58:53.040
But there's also a lot
of other [INAUDIBLE]..

00:58:53.040 --> 00:58:54.415
GARY GENSLER:
They're challenges.

00:58:54.415 --> 00:58:58.015
But I think that
challenges is surmountable.

00:58:58.015 --> 00:59:00.360
AUDIENCE: But even
though it's immutable,

00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:03.700
you can append new information.

00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.900
So isn't that the whole
purpose of blockchain.

00:59:06.900 --> 00:59:10.650
Your citizenship may change, but
then you append new information

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:13.530
saying that your citizenship
has been updated.

00:59:13.530 --> 00:59:17.220
And that becomes the
source of truth now.

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:19.780
GARY GENSLER: I'm
agreeing with that.

00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:21.000
I think that's correct.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:25.290
I think that's a
solvable challenge.

00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:29.620
Hugo had his hand up.

00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:31.578
And then we're going
to go on just to--

00:59:31.578 --> 00:59:33.370
AUDIENCE: So I'm going
to question the idea

00:59:33.370 --> 00:59:36.640
that having a blockchain
means identity theft is

00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:37.930
no longer an issue.

00:59:37.930 --> 00:59:40.742
I think it makes
it a bigger issue.

00:59:40.742 --> 00:59:42.450
What happens if you
lose your private key

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:45.100
or if somebody finds a
private key or somebody

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:46.808
cuts your eye out or whatever?

00:59:50.620 --> 00:59:53.965
But really, if somebody steals
your identity, then it's gone.

00:59:53.965 --> 00:59:55.090
You're not getting it back.

00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:56.840
GARY GENSLER: Oh,
steals your private key.

00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:58.930
Your identity
identity is stolen.

00:59:58.930 --> 01:00:01.320
AUDIENCE: Steals
your private key.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.425
If you don't protect
that with your life,

01:00:04.425 --> 01:00:06.848
then your life is gone.

01:00:06.848 --> 01:00:08.080
GARY GENSLER: Right.

01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:09.910
I think Hugo's raising
the right question.

01:00:09.910 --> 01:00:12.250
But that just means that's
not the right solution.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:18.075
You can't pin it all on just
one private key that's lost.

01:00:18.075 --> 01:00:22.070
AUDIENCE: Well, the answer is
also use multiple biometrics.

01:00:22.070 --> 01:00:25.030
And yes, sure, if you lose your
hand, your eye, your retina

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:27.220
and you go to the
DMV, maybe they'll

01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:29.250
make an exception for you.

01:00:29.250 --> 01:00:32.260
Hopefully like 10 people
ever show up that way.

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:34.810
GARY GENSLER: Let me try this--

01:00:34.810 --> 01:00:37.010
plow in for a second of
what are the projects.

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:40.960
And this is a short
representation.

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:45.670
I could have made three more
pages of representation.

01:00:45.670 --> 01:00:48.580
I'm going to hit three or
four of these just for fun.

01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:50.930
There's three or
four that are ICOs.

01:00:50.930 --> 01:00:52.720
I'm going to choose
to skip all of those.

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.340
But there are, I want to mention
that Civic Secure Identity,

01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:00.565
Existence IC,
Sovrin which gets--

01:01:00.565 --> 01:01:06.310
S-O-V-R-I-N-- but Sovrin
that gets a lot of write ups

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:11.320
in other papers were all
ICOs, Initial Coin Offerings,

01:01:11.320 --> 01:01:16.420
to use a token to incentivize
a system of, usually,

01:01:16.420 --> 01:01:19.610
self-sovereign
identity at some point.

01:01:19.610 --> 01:01:22.090
None are up and running yet.

01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:26.080
And I have my doubts about
some initial coin offerings.

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.310
But there are three or four.

01:01:27.310 --> 01:01:29.260
And there were probably
six or 10 others

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:30.655
that I didn't quickly find.

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:36.130
Bitnation's an
interesting project

01:01:36.130 --> 01:01:38.620
that literally you
can voluntarily

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:41.080
get a citizenship in Bitnation.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.980
It is a decentralized
borderless voluntary nation.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:48.130
But the keyword is voluntary.

01:01:48.130 --> 01:01:50.200
They don't have a UN membership.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:52.480
They're not part of the
World Trade Organization.

01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:55.300
They have no geography.

01:01:55.300 --> 01:01:58.510
But the concept is, you can
get a Bitnation passport.

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:01.090
And you can get
some authentication

01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:05.020
through that about some
attributes about your birth

01:02:05.020 --> 01:02:08.040
and things like that.

01:02:08.040 --> 01:02:12.490
There is a standard setting
group, Distributed Identity

01:02:12.490 --> 01:02:14.740
Foundation that we're going
to talk about in a minute,

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.450
and I'm going to
show a slide, which

01:02:16.450 --> 01:02:19.010
is just a whole bunch of efforts
coming together and saying,

01:02:19.010 --> 01:02:24.220
well, maybe we can do some
standards around this.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:28.960
And then there's Rebooting
Web-of-Trust that runs events.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.505
I think their only
economic model

01:02:30.505 --> 01:02:33.400
is to make money on the events.

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:36.070
But some of their research
and some of their papers

01:02:36.070 --> 01:02:42.070
are very interesting, that
you can read about this.

01:02:42.070 --> 01:02:46.420
And not listed on this, one area
that's spending a lot of time

01:02:46.420 --> 01:02:52.880
on self-sovereign identity is
the World Wide Web Consortium,

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.380
W3C.

01:02:56.770 --> 01:03:00.760
You can go and on GitHub you can
read all sorts of information

01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.470
from W3C about
self-sovereign identity.

01:03:05.470 --> 01:03:08.680
And they're promoting
ways to do digital ID,

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:10.840
and trying to form standards.

01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:15.490
So I think W3C, which is not
really a blockchain project,

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:18.130
and this Distributed
Identity Foundation,

01:03:18.130 --> 01:03:20.830
for any of you that are
actually interested in pursuing

01:03:20.830 --> 01:03:23.020
some of this, you want
to stay abreast of it.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:26.380
Because it's the standard
setting also that I think

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.530
will be relevant.

01:03:29.530 --> 01:03:31.420
But questions or
thoughts for those

01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:35.070
who have done research
on some of these?

01:03:35.070 --> 01:03:38.260
Other than Alin who
we've heard from a bunch.

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:38.760
All right.

01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:40.195
What's your question?

01:03:40.195 --> 01:03:42.295
AUDIENCE: Well, my
first thought is

01:03:42.295 --> 01:03:44.550
they don't solve identity
theft in the United States.

01:03:44.550 --> 01:03:46.030
GARY GENSLER: They don't
solve identity theft

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:47.010
in the United States.

01:03:47.010 --> 01:03:47.700
AUDIENCE: Why?

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.490
Because there's a certain
policy by the US government

01:03:50.490 --> 01:03:52.960
that asks everyone
to accept SSNs.

01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:55.290
And if James has
my SSN, then James

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.140
is me for all
intents and purposes.

01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:58.840
So that is a policy issue.

01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.260
So these companies are
basically a very inefficient way

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.108
to change the policy.

01:04:03.108 --> 01:04:04.650
Hundreds of millions
of dollars being

01:04:04.650 --> 01:04:05.700
invested in all of these guys.

01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:07.742
And by the way, all of
them do public key crypto.

01:04:07.742 --> 01:04:10.572
It's not like something
revolutionary here.

01:04:10.572 --> 01:04:13.030
But at some point, some of them
will get some market share,

01:04:13.030 --> 01:04:14.550
maybe convince a few banks.

01:04:14.550 --> 01:04:16.663
And maybe those banks will
convince the government

01:04:16.663 --> 01:04:17.330
to start doing--

01:04:17.330 --> 01:04:20.880
GARY GENSLER: So you're saying
that an underlying challenge,

01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:23.040
at least in this
country, is that we

01:04:23.040 --> 01:04:28.140
have an antiquated public
policy related to a tax

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.440
ID called social
security number.

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:34.980
And initially, social security
numbers were not even a tax ID.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:39.360
Initially, they were to
participate in a retirement

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.090
program called social security.

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:43.800
And you were not
legally required

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:50.070
to have a number in the 1930s or
'40s when it first came about.

01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:56.100
I didn't get my social security
number until I was 14, I think.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:01.380
Now you pretty much get them
at birth in this country.

01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:02.970
You can't use it for much.

01:05:02.970 --> 01:05:04.750
You're not working.

01:05:04.750 --> 01:05:09.420
But you're saying it's a
public policy challenge,

01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.128
at least here.

01:05:10.128 --> 01:05:11.670
I would say in every
country, there's

01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:14.010
some public policy
challenges that

01:05:14.010 --> 01:05:19.590
are very real around how
attributes of identity

01:05:19.590 --> 01:05:22.770
are measured, whether it's
off of taxes or birth records

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:23.470
and so forth.

01:05:23.470 --> 01:05:23.970
Can I hold?

01:05:23.970 --> 01:05:27.510
Because I want to just
hit two other things.

01:05:27.510 --> 01:05:30.480
This Foundation, these are all
the people in this Foundation

01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.460
doing all of this work.

01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:35.250
It's just a list that
you can look at later.

01:05:35.250 --> 01:05:37.170
And they've set up--

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:40.170
and I apologize-- they set
up sort of this whole idea

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:43.250
about decentralized
ID and server.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.480
So they have a whole program.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:49.800
It's not a small effort that
they are investing in this.

01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.130
And I only put it up to say,
there is a lot of energy.

01:05:53.130 --> 01:05:57.270
And Alin might be right, it's
all fraught with some risk

01:05:57.270 --> 01:06:00.810
because it's on the backs
of government ID systems,

01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:01.740
not just in the US.

01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:11.080
Public key infrastructure
could change.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.900
And a lot of these concepts
are on decentralized public key

01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:16.950
infrastructure.

01:06:16.950 --> 01:06:19.420
Basically, where are
these public keys?

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:23.400
Whether it's Facebook public
key or any public key,

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:25.950
where is it stored?

01:06:25.950 --> 01:06:28.740
I suspect, Alin, that you'd
say this is at least going

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:33.010
in a little better direction.

01:06:33.010 --> 01:06:35.950
This is a key part
of just saying,

01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:38.770
instead of the public key
and having these certificate

01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:41.470
authorities, to
have a secure way

01:06:41.470 --> 01:06:44.860
to store the public
keys in a decentralized,

01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:49.900
hashed, using hash functions
and blockchain technology.

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:51.400
And I think all
of them have this

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:53.030
in the middle of it somewhere.

01:06:53.030 --> 01:06:54.600
AUDIENCE: It's a
consensus problem.

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.500
You want to agree.

01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:57.950
Everybody needs to agree
with Facebook's public keys

01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:59.170
otherwise we're in trouble.

01:06:59.170 --> 01:07:00.910
Because you might use
my fake Facebook server.

01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:02.577
So it's really just
a consensus problem.

01:07:02.577 --> 01:07:04.120
It's not about hashes, security.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:04.870
Forget about that.

01:07:04.870 --> 01:07:07.780
Everybody has to agree what
Facebook public key is.

01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:10.077
And that's where the
blockchain comes in.

01:07:10.077 --> 01:07:10.910
GARY GENSLER: Sorry.

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:11.410
Shawn.

01:07:11.410 --> 01:07:17.110
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to answer Alin's question.

01:07:17.110 --> 01:07:20.130
I don't think that's a
public policy problem.

01:07:20.130 --> 01:07:22.870
If you want to change
the SSN system,

01:07:22.870 --> 01:07:24.730
you have to change
the entire system

01:07:24.730 --> 01:07:27.490
of how the banks operate,
how the insurance companies

01:07:27.490 --> 01:07:28.040
operate.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:30.130
And the cost, the
social cost, is

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:33.580
much greater than just changing
the [INAUDIBLE] key itself.

01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:36.790
I think he's entirely coming
from the point of view

01:07:36.790 --> 01:07:40.900
for the implementation of
[INAUDIBLE] consideration

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:45.215
of the hidden economic cost
of such implementation.

01:07:45.215 --> 01:07:46.840
AUDIENCE: But there
is the Patriot Act,

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:49.360
which says banks have to send
your SSN to the government,

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:53.768
which basically means banks
need to continue using SSNs.

01:07:53.768 --> 01:07:55.060
So in some sense, you're right.

01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.155
But also, government
has to do something.

01:07:57.155 --> 01:07:59.540
GARY GENSLER: So let's move on.

01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:01.270
I don't think it's
just here in the US.

01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:06.777
What's happened is the
attributes of our identity,

01:08:06.777 --> 01:08:09.360
or our credentials of identity--
whether it's for tax systems,

01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.340
for banking systems--

01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:16.649
in the last 30-odd years, as
we've digitized, and also post

01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:20.609
9/11 and terrorists,
we started to use

01:08:20.609 --> 01:08:22.800
all of these things for
anti-money laundering,

01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:24.390
know your customer.

01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:28.439
So the financial
system, the tax system,

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:30.779
and our identity
systems have now all

01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:37.106
been kind of linked up, and not
always with the best intent.

01:08:37.106 --> 01:08:38.939
I mean, maybe they were
the good intentions.

01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:42.850
But with not with
the best results.

01:08:42.850 --> 01:08:45.090
And it's part of why I
thought, if we were going

01:08:45.090 --> 01:08:49.890
to cover blockchain technology
in the financial sector,

01:08:49.890 --> 01:08:53.310
identification systems were
really important as well.

01:08:53.310 --> 01:08:58.729
Because it's so linked up
with banking and finance.

01:08:58.729 --> 01:09:02.040
And that wouldn't
have been the case

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.670
before the digital revolution
and the internet and so forth.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:10.050
I think this is the
last cover slide.

01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:14.149
But this is self-sovereign
identity platforms.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:20.210
Basically right now, if we
want to keep our identity,

01:09:20.210 --> 01:09:23.810
if we want to keep our
identity and only give it up,

01:09:23.810 --> 01:09:26.029
a platform could create
and enforce rules

01:09:26.029 --> 01:09:27.470
governing the workflow.

01:09:27.470 --> 01:09:31.640
This is a little thing
called bitsonblocks.net.

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:38.000
But pretty much
most of the startups

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.740
are using an
architecture around this.

01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:44.029
This happens to be Bits
on Block's view of it.

01:09:44.029 --> 01:09:49.220
But it's basically, I'm going to
keep my attributes of identity.

01:09:49.220 --> 01:09:51.840
And I choose when
I can give it up

01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.790
and when it's used,
authorities, and issuers.

01:10:00.310 --> 01:10:06.230
So I think I have hopefully--

01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:06.910
oh, yes.

01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:07.550
MIT.

01:10:07.550 --> 01:10:10.130
That's where I wanted to go.

01:10:10.130 --> 01:10:11.420
So what did you all think?

01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:13.940
You read the little
article about your own--

01:10:17.868 --> 01:10:19.390
you going to get in it?

01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:23.165
James, you going to get your
blockchain blockchain diploma?

01:10:23.165 --> 01:10:23.960
AUDIENCE: Yep.

01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:25.570
[INAUDIBLE] I have
some experience.

01:10:25.570 --> 01:10:28.840
I started trying to
get hold of my diploma

01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:36.190
back in 2012 for a degree
that I got in 2007.

01:10:36.190 --> 01:10:38.950
My university was
declared independent

01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:40.930
from the University of London.

01:10:40.930 --> 01:10:42.910
There was a whole record messup.

01:10:42.910 --> 01:10:46.900
I'm trying to get a
copy of my transcript.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.430
GARY GENSLER: And
you can't get it?

01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:51.140
AUDIENCE: I had to go through
many different people, say, oh,

01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:51.740
can I get it?

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:54.115
And they'd say, oh, we have
to contact the old university

01:10:54.115 --> 01:10:55.470
because we were part of them.

01:10:55.470 --> 01:10:57.178
GARY GENSLER: I'm
going to shorten your--

01:10:57.178 --> 01:11:02.440
so how many of you are going to
get a blockchain backed diploma

01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:03.690
when you graduate MIT?

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:08.060
All right.

01:11:08.060 --> 01:11:10.690
A quarter of you.

01:11:10.690 --> 01:11:17.435
And those that aren't, who
didn't raise their hand?

01:11:17.435 --> 01:11:20.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.100
GARY GENSLER: Oh, you will.

01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:22.360
Wait a minute.

01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.650
I didn't see any
hands go up over here.

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:24.280
So you're not?

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.115
I don't care really.

01:11:26.115 --> 01:11:26.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:26.990 --> 01:11:30.040
GARY GENSLER: Oh, you did?

01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.968
I want somebody who
didn't raise their hand.

01:11:31.968 --> 01:11:33.260
Why aren't you going to get it?

01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:35.140
AUDIENCE: For me, it's just
pure lack of information

01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:35.890
about the process.

01:11:35.890 --> 01:11:37.900
How to get it,
what I have to do.

01:11:37.900 --> 01:11:41.432
So I don't know yet
if I will or not.

01:11:41.432 --> 01:11:44.130
GARY GENSLER: So
you're just saying

01:11:44.130 --> 01:11:48.645
there is an information curve
you have to learn about it.

01:11:48.645 --> 01:11:51.020
The people that raised their
hands and said you'd get it,

01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:53.310
how many of you will
also get a paper diploma?

01:11:57.050 --> 01:12:01.650
You want something for the wall
or for the significant other

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:04.490
or for the children
or the parents.

01:12:04.490 --> 01:12:05.540
Right?

01:12:05.540 --> 01:12:07.550
Right?

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:09.560
There's still
something about that.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:12.740
I don't even know where my
college diploma is, by the way.

01:12:15.500 --> 01:12:17.210
But you still want
that piece of paper.

01:12:17.210 --> 01:12:19.230
Was there anybody
who was only going

01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:20.495
to get a blockchain diploma?

01:12:25.050 --> 01:12:27.250
And any of you that go to
a different university,

01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:29.690
do you wish your university
had a blockchain diploma?

01:12:32.650 --> 01:12:35.560
Nobody's going to speak up.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.210
Maybe not.

01:12:37.210 --> 01:12:37.710
All right.

01:12:37.710 --> 01:12:38.830
So it's a novelty.

01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:39.420
It's MIT.

01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:40.200
We're innovative.

01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.760
We have it.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.335
I hope you all do
come next Tuesday.

01:12:44.335 --> 01:12:46.110
It will be our
last time together.

01:12:46.110 --> 01:12:48.960
I'm going to try to wrap
up with some ground truth

01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:53.580
as to what I think the whole
topic and this subject is.

01:12:53.580 --> 01:12:56.400
This was meant to be about
the business of blockchain

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:59.950
technology, getting through at
least enough of the details,

01:12:59.950 --> 01:13:02.550
knowing those details,
and then saying, well, how

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:06.870
does that apply to the markets.

01:13:06.870 --> 01:13:09.570
Hopefully, you feel
that you've gotten,

01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:13.200
and Tuesday we'll summarize it
all, some critical reasoning

01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:17.430
skills that you can sort through
the hype and the reality.

01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:21.510
And those of you that
came in maximalist,

01:13:21.510 --> 01:13:23.020
you're probably
more in the middle.

01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:25.770
Some of you that were
minimalist maybe came--

01:13:25.770 --> 01:13:28.440
well, maybe you're still,
but you came a little--

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:31.740
because I thought that was
the right place to teach.

01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:35.780
And you've all given
me tremendous feedback.

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:37.280
And I've learned a
lot from you all.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:39.340
But let's keep it going.

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:41.180
See you on Tuesday.

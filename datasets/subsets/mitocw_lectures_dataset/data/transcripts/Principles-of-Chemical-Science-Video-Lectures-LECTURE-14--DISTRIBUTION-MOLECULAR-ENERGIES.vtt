00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Last time, we went through the
same arguments that Maxwell and

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Boltzmann did to understand the
microscopic origin of the ideal

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
gas law, PV equal nRT.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And we saw how Maxwell had
hypothesized that the pressure

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
of a gas on the walls of some
container, if the molecules were

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
moving and they collided onto
the walls, that pressure must be

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
due to the individual impacts of
the molecules on the wall.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
That must be due to the change
in the momentum of the wall when

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the molecules slammed right into
it.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And that change in momentum
over some change in time is this

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
force.
That force divided by the total

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
area is the pressure.
And it was using that argument

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
that we came up with an
expression, just like Maxwell

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
did for the pressure times the
volume.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And we see that we were able to
write it in terms of the

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
velocity of the molecules that
were moving in this gas.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Well, that is very nice because
if we have this theoretical

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
expression P times V,
and we know experimentally that

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
P times V equal nRT,
if this theory is

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
correct, then this quantity n M,
average of the velocity

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
squared, over three,
that better be equal to nRT.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Or, solving for what we call

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
the root mean square velocity,
that better be equal to the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
square root of 3RT over M.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
That kinetic theory made a
prediction for what the velocity

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
ought to be.
It took, of course,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
another hundred years before
somebody could measure that.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And, of course,
it is correct.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
But what is interesting here is
that this model gave us an

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
understanding for what
temperature is.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Temperature is a measure of the
speed of the molecules in the

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
gas.
It is also, as we saw last

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
time, a measure of their kinetic
energy.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We saw that the kinetic energy
is one-half M average of the

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
velocity squared. We put

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
in our result from kinetic
theory.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
That shows us that the average
energy is three-halves RT.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Temperature is the measure of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
the kinetic energy of these
molecules in the gas.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
For the first time,
there was a microscopic

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
understanding of what
temperature was.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Now, what we looked at also,
last time, was the

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution
of velocities or speeds and

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
talked about this particular
functional form.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
How there was this quadratic
dependence right here,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
a low v because of the v
squared here and then an

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000
exponentially decaying tail.
There were two parameters,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
the mass and the temperature.
We talked about that last time.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But, of course,
if there is a distribution here

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
of speeds where this
distribution is a probability of

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.000
finding a molecule with a
particular speed between v and v

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
plus dv, --
-- then there also has to be a

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
distribution of energies because
the velocity is related to the

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
energy.
What do we have to do?

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
We have to take that
Maxwell-Boltzmann speed

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
distribution and change the
variable to energy.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
We know how to do that.
We know how to equate those two

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
distribution functions.
And, using the Jacobean of the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
transformation that we talked
about last time,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
we can calculate what the
energy distribution is.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
f of E is our
Maxwell-Boltzmann energy

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
distribution.
It is the probability of

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
finding a molecule with a
kinetic energy E to E plus dE.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
It also has a decaying
exponential term,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
here, with the energy in the
argument, and it is multiplied

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000
by E of the one-half.
Let's take a look at what that

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
distribution function looks
like.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Here it is.
Notice, as we learned last

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
time, that the energy has
nothing to do with the mass of

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
the particle.
The only parameter that is

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.000
important is the temperature.
At a given temperature,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
all particles,
it doesn't matter what their

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
mass is, have the same energy.
So, all particles at

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
degrees Kelvin have a
Maxwell-Boltzmann energy

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
distribution that looks like
this.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
There is a very rapid rise in
that distribution function,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
unlike the velocity
distribution,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
which increased as v squared.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.000
It peaks rapidly,
and then there is an

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
exponentially decaying term in
the energy.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000
At 1500 degrees Kelvin,
the energy distribution looks

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
like this.
The energy of the molecules has

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
increased.
Since this is a probability,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
and the area under these curves
has to equal to one,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
if the energy goes up,
that is we have more molecules

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.000
out here with higher energies,
well, then this maximum value

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
for the probabilities has got to
go down because we have to keep

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
the area under that curve equal
to one, since this is a

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
probability.
What we see here,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.000
as we raise the energy,
is that we have more and more

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000
molecules with high energies.
There are not a lot of them,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
but there are some.
And they are going to be really

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
important in the example I am
going to show you in just a

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
moment.
Average energy at 600 Kelvin,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
just three-halves RT,
is 7.5 kilojoules per mole.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Average energy at 1500 Kelvin
is 18.7 kilojoules per mole.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
But now, I want to show you an
example of the importance of

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
this Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution function for

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
energies to chemical reactions,
the importance of it in making

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
some kinds of chemical reactions
actually work.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
And so the example is going to
be this reaction.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
This reaction is called steam
reforming of natural gas.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000
It is the reaction of methane
plus water.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Natural gas is mostly methane.
But this reaction of methane

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000
and water makes CO and hydrogen.
It

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
turns out that this reaction
does not work in the gas phase.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000
That is, if you have a methane
molecule and water molecule

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:56.000
collide, they are just going to
collide, bounce apart and go in

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000
their opposite directions.
They are not going to make CO

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
and hydrogen.
And so what you have to have in

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000
this reaction to make it go is a
catalyst.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000
That catalyst is going to be a
nickel surface.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.000
A catalyst is something that
will lower the activation energy

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000
barrier by changing the
mechanism of a reaction so that

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000
the reaction can proceed.
In this case,

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
what happens is that the
methane and the water impinge on

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000
this nickel metal catalyst.
And the methane and the water

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
decompose.
They fall apart to their

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000
elements on that nickel surface.
And then, once you have carbon,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
hydrogen and oxygen on that
nickel surface,

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
the atoms rearrange and come
off as CO and molecular

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000
hydrogen.
So, that nickel surface is a

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000
catalyst.
We call this the catalytic

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.000
reaction.
In particular,

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
we call it a heterogeneous
catalytic reaction.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:08.000
It is heterogeneous because the
catalyst is in a different phase

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000
than the reactants.
The catalyst here is a solid.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000
The reactants are gases.
A homogeneous catalyst is one

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
in which the phase of the
catalyst and the reactants is

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
the same.
This is a heterogeneous

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
catalytic reaction.
It turns out that this reaction

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000
here is really an important
reaction from the standpoint of

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:39.000
the production of hydrogen.
All of the hydrogen that you

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
use, you know,
if you are doing a laboratory

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000
experiment and you go get a tank
of hydrogen, that hydrogen is

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
made by this reaction,
by reacting methane and water

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.000
to form that hydrogen.
All of our commercial sources

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
of hydrogen come from carrying
out this reaction.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
For example,
if you are in the business of

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
ammonia synthesis,
which is taking hydrogen and

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
nitrogen to make ammonia,
which is also carried out on an

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
iron surface,
another heterogeneous catalytic

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
reaction.
And ammonia,

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
of course, is the starting
material for lots of chemicals,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:30.000
in particular fertilizers.
If you have an ammonia plant,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
right next to the ammonia plant
you have a steamer-forming plant

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
to make the hydrogen to feed
into this reaction.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
And another place where this is
useful is in methanol synthesis.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.000
That is, you can take hydrogen
and CO on a copper zinc oxide

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000
heterogeneous catalyst and make
methanol, the starting point for

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
gasoline, which now is certainly
economically feasible.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
But it turns out that this
reaction here is really a hard

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
one to carry out.
Despite the fact that nickel is

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000
a catalyst for the reaction and
makes it go, the reaction still

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000
has to be carried out at very
high temperatures.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
1500 degrees kelvin is a very
high temperature.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000
It also needs very high
pressure.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
And one of the reasons why we
don't have a hydrogen economy is

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000
because it is so difficult to
make.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Hydrogen can be done,
and it is done in all of the

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
commercial processes that I
mentioned to you,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
but it is still hard.
1500 degrees kelvin,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
high pressures.
The question is,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
why is it so hard?
Why is there this barrier here?

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Why do we need to raise the
temperature of the gas in order

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000
to get this reaction to go?
Well, let's take a look at

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.000
that.
What there exists here in this

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
problem is what is called an
activation energy barrier to

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000
making the reaction go.
It turns out that this

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.000
activation energy barrier is
really in the very first step of

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000
the reaction,
which is pulling the methane

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:27.000
apart, pulling that first
hydrogen atom off of the methane

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000
molecule.
What I represent right here is

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000
the energy of the reaction as a
function of the reaction,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000
and the reaction here is just
the first step.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000
It is taking methane gas,
pulling the hydrogen off so

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000
that you have a methyl radical
stuck to the surface and you

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
have a hydrogen atom stuck to
the surface.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
It is just breaking that first
C-H bond.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
What you can see here is that
you have to put 50 kilojoules of

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
energy into that reaction in
order to make it go.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
You have to put that 50
kilocalories of energy in first,

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
before you get any energy back.
You can see that this is

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
exothermic.
But you have to put this energy

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
in, in order to get that
reaction to go.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Well, how do we know that?
Let me back up a minute.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Here is where the
Maxwell-Boltzmann energy

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.000
distribution is important.
What I did was I took those

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Boltzmann energy distributions
that I plotted for you at

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Kelvin and 1500 Kelvin and
turned them on their side.

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
This is essentially equal to
the probability of finding a

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
molecule at a particular energy
versus the energy.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Here is the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution at 600 degrees

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Kelvin.
It is peaked to very low

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
energies.
And, if you look here in this

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Maxwell-Boltzmann tail,
there are not very many

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000
molecules that have enough
energy to get over that barrier.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
However, if we raise the
temperature of the gas to

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
degrees Kelvin,
then now you can see that there

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000
are more molecules here in the
high energy part of this tail.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And it is these molecules at
these high energies that

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
actually can get over this
barrier to dissociation of the

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
methane molecule.
They are not many of those

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
molecules with high energy,
but there are some.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
And that is important,
because what happens is when

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
they have enough energy,
they react and they leave.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
And then this Boltzmann
distribution re-equilibrates.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
If the high energy molecules
leave, then there are lots of

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000
collisions here that kick some
more molecules up to the high

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
energy part of the tail,
and they react.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
And so it works.
That is why it is important.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
How do we really know that
there is this barrier here to

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.000
the dissociation of methane,
and why is there this barrier?

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
What is the physical origin of
this barrier to pulling this C-H

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000
bond apart?
Well, one way we could know

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that there was this barrier
there for sure is to do the

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000
following.
If we had a way to take methane

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000
gas and make it have just a
single energy,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
not the Maxwell-Boltzmann
distribution of energies that

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000
have lots of different energies,
which have lots of different

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.000
energies in them,
and you saw how broad those

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
curves were.
But if we had a way to make

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
methane gas with just say energy
E sub 1, whatever that is,

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
we could then take those
molecules with just those

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:02.000
energies, aim them at this
nickel surface,

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.000
and see if the methane fell
apart.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000
And, if it didn't,
then we would prepare molecules

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
at some higher energy and see if
they fell apart.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
If they didn't then we would go
to higher energy.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
We would keep going until we
got to the top of the barrier.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Well, how do you do that?
How do you make molecules with

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
a particular energy?
Because I just showed you a

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
Maxwell-Boltzmann energy
distribution at 300 Kelvin,

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
600 Kelvin.
There are a lot of energies

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
present.
How do we make molecules with

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000
just one energy?
We have a way to do that by

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:52.000
using some beam techniques and
high pressure adiabatic

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
expansions.
Basically, the way it works is

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000
this.
What we are going to do is take

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000
a tube here, which is going to
have a high pressure of methane

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
in it.
Then we are going to punch a

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
little hole in that tube.
This tube is actually sitting

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
in a vacuum, so we are going to
expand the methane from that

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
tube into the vacuum.
We are going to squirt it out.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
It is going to become a beam of
molecules.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
But when you expand a gas from
high pressure to low pressure,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
this expansion is called an
adiabatic expansion,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
which means the gas cools.
I will explain that in a

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
moment, but the adiabatic
expansion you are going to talk

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
a lot about in 5.60.
And, if you are a chemical

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000
engineer, you will talk even
more about it past 5.60.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Here is how it works.
You take these molecules and

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
squirt them out.
Because the pressure right here

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
is so high, what happens is
there are lots and lots and lots

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
of collisions.
And so, you can imagine,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
if you have some slow molecule
just kind of lumbering along and

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000
a fast one comes and hits you,
what is going to happen is you

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
are going to speed up,
and the fast one is going to

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
slow down.
And, if you keep doing that

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
again and again and again,
all the molecules are going to

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.000
end up with the same energy or
the same velocity.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
If you have so many collisions,
after a while they are going to

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
all have the same velocity or
the same energy because one gets

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.000
sped up, one gets slowed down.
They are all going to end up

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:51.000
with the same energy.
That is what happens.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000
That is how we make a beam of
molecules, a source of molecules

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
with the same kinetic energy.
And basically,

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
what is happening then is that
before the expansion,

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
just look at this curve,
here is an actual Boltzmann

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000
distribution of velocities.
It is broad.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
But after this expansion,
here is the distribution.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
It is really pretty narrow.
If you put a temperature to

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
that distribution,
you might find that at one

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
degree Kelvin,
you can really make molecules

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000
with a single or very narrow
distribution in energies.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
That is what we do.
We make those molecules with

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
this energy E sub 1.
Then we have some more tricks

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
for changing those energies in a
controlled way.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:46.000
And we just keep cranking those
energies up and watch to see

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000
when the methane falls apart.
And so, you get data that kind

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
of looks like this.
This is a dissociation

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
probability of a methane as a
function of its energy.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
This is in kilocalories per
mole.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
At some point,
say right about here,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000
15 kilocalories per mole,
the dissociation probability

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000
skyrockets.
All of a sudden,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
you are at a high enough energy
to get that methane to fall

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
apart.
This tells you exactly where

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
that barrier is.
But now, the question is,

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000
why is there this barrier?
Physically, why is there a

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:38.000
barrier to pulling the hydrogen
off of the carbon when that

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
methane molecule comes close to
the surface?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Well, the reason is this.
In order to break the

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:54.000
carbon-hydrogen bond in methane,
in order to have enough energy

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000
to break that bond,
what you need to do is you need

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000
to simultaneously form a
nickel-carbon bond and a

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
nickel-hydrogen bond.
In other words,

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.000
when this methane molecule here
comes into some nickel surface

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000
very slowly, because that
methane is tetrahedral and the

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000
carbon is kind of hidden in the
center, the hydrogens interact

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
with the nickel.
But the carbon does not get in

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
close enough to the nickel to
start to form a nickel-carbon

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000
bond.
Now, if you speed that methane

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
molecule up and you really ram
it into the surface,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
upon collision of the molecule
with the surface,

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
the hydrogens are pushed back,
the carbon gets in close enough

00:21:54.000 --> 00:22:00.000
to the nickel to start to form,
here, this nickel-carbon bond.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.000
You form a nickel-hydrogen
bond, and now you can break that

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
C-H bond.
We call this black chemistry.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
The barrier,
there, to that reaction

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.000
physically is the amount of
energy that you have to put into

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
the molecule to push those
hydrogens back,

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000
to bend those hydrogens back to
distort this methane molecule.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000
Once you do that,
the reaction goes.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000
You are on a roll there.
It goes.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
So, that is the physical origin
of this barrier,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
here, to the dissociation of
methane.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
You need to put enough kinetic
energy into those methane

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
molecules in order to get over
that barrier.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
And we do that on a practical
scale by raising the temperature

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
of the gas.
And on a microscopic scale,

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000
this is what is happening.
You can imagine that my

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:11.000
students and I did this
experiment 15 years ago.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000
But then, we said if this
barrier here is the energy

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000
required to deform that methane
molecule, then we should be able

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
to do this experiment.
This experiment is the

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:31.000
following.
We are going to take our nickel

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.000
surface, here,
and lower the temperature of

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
the surface to 47 kelvin.
At that temperature,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
what we can do is we can freeze
a layer of methane on the

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
surface.
We call it fizzy-sorb,

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
a layer of methane on the
surface.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
It will just stick there.
And then, if this barrier is

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
the energy required to deform or
to start the molecule,

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
then in principle I could take
a hammer and pound that molecule

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000
into the correct shape for the
transition state that leads to

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:09.000
dissociation.
It sounds like a simple idea,

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:14.000
and it is, except that we
cannot really take that hammer.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
But we can take an argon atom.
We can freeze the methane onto

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000
the surface, and now we come in
with an argon atom.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
That is just a big ball.
Or, a xenon atom or a krypton

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
atom.
And we know how to accelerate

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.000
xenon or krypton.
We don't accelerate it too

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
much, 50 kilocalories,
70 kilocalories per mole,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
something like that.
And then we can bring it in.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
What happens is that the impact
of the collision on that methane

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
causes that methane molecule to
compress, distort,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
gets it into the configuration
of the transition state that

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
leads to the methane falling
apart.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
And so, you get the same
result.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
The question,
there, is just getting the

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:09.000
energy into the molecule to
actually distort it,

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:14.000
to deform it so that you can
make the nickel-carbon bond and

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.000
the nickel-hydrogen bond.
That is the key.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
My students and I,
after we had spent many years

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
doing this experiment and spent
a lot of money on this

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
experiment, said we have proven
for sure that when a bug flies

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
into the windshield of your car,
you do get the same result as

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
if you hit the bug on the
windshield of your car with a

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000
bug swatter.
That is what we get.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000
This is an example of one
chemical reaction for which we

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
know the physical origin of the
barrier.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:01.000
There are very few chemical
reactions for which we know

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
anything about the physical
origin of a barrier to a

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
reaction.
Now, what I want to talk about

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
is go back to kinetic theory,
because the kinetic theory is

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
going to allow us to calculate a
couple of more quantities that

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.000
are of interest to us.
And one of those quantities is

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:37.000
the collision frequency.
And let me just write that on

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
the board here.
What I am going to want to

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
calculate is something called
Z1, or I am going to call it Z1.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:53.000
It is the number of collisions
that a molecule makes in a gas

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
per unit time.
And our unit time is going to

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:06.000
be seconds.
This is the collision frequency

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000
of a single molecule in a gas.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
How am I going to calculate the
quantity using the kinetic

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.000
theory approach that we have
been talking about?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
What I am going to do is this.
I am going to take some gas,

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:38.000
and the molecules in that gas
are represented by these blue

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
circles right here.
They have a diameter D.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:47.000
And then, within that gas,
I am going to imagine this

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.000
lighter blue cylinder.
That cylinder is an imaginary

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
construct.
We are going to use it to

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
calculate this collision
frequency.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
What it is going to be is the
collision volume.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:09.000
I have set the diameter of that
cylinder to be equal to two

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000
times the diameter of the
molecule.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:17.000
I have set this upright.
And the bottom line is that all

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:22.000
of the molecules that
instantaneously happen to be in

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
this cylinder when a molecule
comes through,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000
all of those molecules are
actually going to be hit.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
They are going to suffer a
collision with another molecule.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
And I am going to use that,
the number of molecules in this

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
volume, to calculate this
collision frequency.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
That is what I am going to do.
Snapshot in time,

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000
those molecules are frozen
there, except there is one

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
smart-alecky molecule that comes
cruising on through.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Here he comes.
Bam, bam, bam.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Hits these three molecules,
here, because they are more

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
than halfway into that collision
cylinder.

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:20.000
What I know is this smart-aleck
was moving at some average

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
velocity, which I am going to
call vbar.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
In a time T,
this molecule,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
since it is moving with an
average velocity vbar,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
in a time t,
it is traveling a length vbar

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
times t.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Velocity times time,
that is going to give you a

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.000
length.
And so, I am going to set,

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
for convenience,
this time equal to one second

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000
because that is going to be my
unit of time.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
I want to do this per second.
I am going to set this equal to

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
one second.
Therefore, this molecule is

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000
going to travel a length vbar in
one second.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000
And that is the length that I
am going to make the collision

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
cylinder.
I am going to make that

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:22.000
collision cylinder be vbar long.
That is the distance traveled

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.000
in one second by this
smart-alecky molecule.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Now, all I have to do is I have
got to take the volume of the

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:40.000
collision cylinder and multiply
it by all the molecules that

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
happen to be at the volume at
that particular time.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Because that volume represents
the volume swept out in one

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
second by this smart-alecky
molecule.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:00.000
What is the volume of the
cylinder?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000
I set the diameter to be equal
to 2d.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
The volume of the cylinder is
the cross-sectional area times

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
the length.
That cross-sectional area,

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:16.000
then, is pi r squared,
but r here is equal to d,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:21.000
just to make it confusing.
The area is pi d squared.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
The length is vbar.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000
That is the volume of the
cylinder, pi d squared vbar.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:34.000
So, we have the volume of the

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
cylinder.
Now what we are going to need

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
to know is the density of the
molecules in this cylinder,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
which is the density of the
molecules in the gas.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:50.000
The cylinder is not special.
The cylinder is an imaginary

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
construct that I put in there to
help me calculate the collision

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000
frequency.
I need the density of the

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
molecules in the gas or in the
cylinder.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.000
The density of the molecules I
am going to set as equal to N,

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000
the total number of molecules
in this volume,

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000
divided by the volume of the
gas.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
I am going to call that rho.
N over V is going to be equal

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
to rho.
That is the number of molecules

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
per cubic meter.
That is the density of the gas.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
This is the symbol that I am
going to use from now on for

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000
density defined as molecules per
cubic meter.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000
Then the collision frequency is
simply going to be the density

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
of the molecules times the
volume of the cylinder.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
The collision frequency Z1,
here, is this volume of the

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
cylinder, pi d squared vbar
times the density.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Why?

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Because I set it up so that
every molecule in that cylinder

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:04.000
would suffer a collision.
And that cylinder is the length

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
that a molecule travels in one
second.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
There is the density times the
volume.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
The meters cubed disappears.
What I have left is rho,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
the density,
pi d squared vbar.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
This is collisions per second.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000
So, I have my collision
frequency.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
This is the single-molecule
collision frequency.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
This is the frequency of
collisions that one molecule

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
makes with the other gas
molecules.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
That is important.
We are going to do a different

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
kind of collision frequency in
just a moment.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
But now, it turns out that
there is another factor here

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
that I had left out because I
haven't done as sophisticated of

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
an analysis as I could.
And that is that I made the

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
assumption in my picture before
that all the other molecules

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
were frozen in time and that
there was only one smart-aleck

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:15.000
that was moving around,
cruising through.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.000
The reality is they are all
moving.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:23.000
And what I really have to do is
I have to take into account the

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
relative velocities of the
molecules, the relative speeds.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
I can do that.
There is a little more

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
sophisticated analysis in doing
that, but I could do that.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:40.000
And, if we do that,
this makes a difference of the

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.000
square root of two.
I am just going to put that

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
square root of two in there
right now, and later on you will

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
be able to see where that comes
from, in a later course.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
That actually is the collision
frequency of a single molecule

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
in the gas.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000
I am also interested in another
quantity, which is the total

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
collision frequency.
That was the single collision

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:21.000
frequency, but I am also
interested in knowing how many

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:26.000
collisions are occurring in the
entire gas per unit time,

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000
the total collision frequency.
You know why I am interested in

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000
that number?
I am interested in that number

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
because that is going to be the
upper limit to any reaction

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
rate.
A reaction in the gas phase or

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:49.000
in solution cannot happen any
faster than the molecules

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
collide.
They have to collide before a

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
reaction is going to occur.
The total collision frequency,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
the importance of that number
is that it is the upper limit to

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
a reaction rate.
Let's calculate that.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Z is going to be equal to the
collision frequency of one

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.000
molecule, Z1,
times the total number of

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
molecules in the gas, N.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:25.000
That is what N stands for.
But since each collision

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:31.000
involves two molecules,
I am going to have to multiply

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:36.000
this by one-half.
Otherwise, I am going to over

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
count the number of collisions
because each collision involves

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000
two molecules.
The total collision frequency

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000
here is one-half times N times
Z1.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Therefore, if I go and plug in
my expression for Z1 and N and

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
simplify things,
my total collision frequency

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
here is one over the square root
of two times N times rho pi d

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:06.000
squared times the average speed.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
That is my total collisions per

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
second.
This is not rocket science.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:20.000
This is easy.
What I want you to realize is

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:26.000
that you do have to understand
what N is, what rho is,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
what d is, what vbar is.
And I am always surprised on an

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
exam, when we are going to give
you this equation,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
that students don't actually
know what rho is,

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
or N is, or v is,
or d is.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000
This is easy.
You do just have to understand,

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000
this is the total number of
molecules in the gas,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
this is the density of the gas
in molecules per cubic meter,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
the diameter of the molecule,
the average speed.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000
That was just a helpful hint.
This is the upper limit to the

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
reaction rate.
When somebody tells you,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
the rate of this reaction is so
and so many molecules per cubic

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000
meter per second,
what you can do is a

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:24.000
back-of-the-envelope calculation
to see whether or not they are

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.000
telling you the reaction rate is
greater than this number.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
If it is, you can say ah-ha,
got you, it cannot possibly be.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Really important.
If a reaction has this rate,

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
it will mean that the
probability of the reaction

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000
occurring is one.
If the reaction has that rate,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
we call that the gas kinetic
rate.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000
That is a term that we also
use.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Then, finally,
one other quantity from the gas

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
kinetic theory.
Yes?

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
She asked, what velocity,
here, would you use?

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
You actually are going to,
in that particular case,

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
have to take the average of the
average velocities.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
In other words,
if you had two different

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
molecules that were reacting for
this average velocity here,

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
you are going to have to use
the average of the average

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
velocity.
And then your error bars on the

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:44.000
experiment will always be large
enough to take that into

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
consideration.
Good question.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000
One other quantity,
something called the mean free

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.000
path.
What I want to know,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:40:00.000
here, is on the average,
how far does the molecule

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:07.000
travel in the gas before it
suffers a collision?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
That is what a mean free path
is.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
A mean free path in solution.
Sometimes you will do a solid

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
state physics course and will
hear about the electron mean

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
free path.
A mean free path is always the

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
distance traveled between
collisions.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
That is what that is.
And we are going to call it

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
lambda.
This is not wavelength anymore.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
We just changed our definition
of lambda.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Lambda, here,
is the average distance between

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
collisions.
How are we going to calculate

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
that?
What we are going to do is take

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000
the average distance that a
molecule travels per unit time,

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
per second, and are going to
divide it by the number of

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000
collisions that occur per
second.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
And you are going to see that
the per seconds are going to

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
cancel here.
We are going to have the

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
average distance per collision.
That is what we are after.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
This is easy to do because the
average distance traveled per

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
second is simply the average
velocity.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.000
It is meters per second.
The average distance traveled

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
per second.
The number of collisions per

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
second that happened,
we just calculated that.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000
That was Z1.
We can substitute in Z1 vbar,

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
vbar cancels,
and what we are left with is

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:46.000
one over the square root of 2
rho pi d squared.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
That is meters.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:56.000
That is the average distance
the molecule traveled per

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
collision.
This is another general generic

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
quantity useful in many cases,
also in other kinds of cases

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
that I just mentioned in solid
state physics.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:16.000
What I want to do now is that
we said we were going to start

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000
talking about the motions of
molecules.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:24.000
We have taken care of,
now, the translational motion.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Now I want to start talking
about the internal degrees of

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
freedom.
And let's do that.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Let me just see if I have
something, here.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:43.000
Let me raise the board,
here.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
We have talked about this
molecule, which is a set of

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
atoms that are bonded together.
And, as we always say,

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000
they are bonded together for
the mutual comfort of their

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
electrons.
And we saw that it is not

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
frozen.
It moves.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000
It has kinetic energy.
It has velocity.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
The velocity generates this
macroscopic property of

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000
pressure.
But molecules also jiggle.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000
For example,
we are going to take here

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
nitrogen, triple bond.
That triple bond actually

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000
functions like a spring.
We can think of that bond as a

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:49.000
spring between the two atoms.
That spring can stretch,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:54.000
and that spring can compress.
When we tell you the

00:43:54.000 --> 00:44:00.000
equilibrium bond length of some
molecule is some number,

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000
it is the equilibrium bond
length.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
It is not the bond length when
the molecule is stretched.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
It is not the bond length when
the molecule is compressed.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
This motion is the vibrational
motion of the molecule.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
So, we have that kind of
internal motion in a molecule.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Molecules also tumble.
For example,

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
let's take our nitrogen
molecule, again.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000
It rotates around an axis.
Going through the center of the

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
mass, it rotates around this
axis.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
This nitrogen molecule also
rotates around an axis,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
here, perpendicular to the
board.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:06.000
It rotates in that direction.
This is the rotational motion

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:11.000
of the molecule.
The different ways in which we

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
can have this motion are called
modes.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
This is a rotational mode.
This is vibrational mode.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:28.000
We did not use the word before
in talking about translation,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
but those are translational
modes.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Sometimes, we also call these
modes degrees of freedom.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:49.000
A molecule has translational
modes or degrees of freedom,

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:57.000
vibrational degrees of freedom,
and rotational degrees of

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
freedom.
Now, in general,

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:10.000
if you have an N-atom molecule,
you have 3N total modes.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.000
When I say total modes that
means the sum of translation,

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:24.000
rotation and vibration.
Of those 3N total modes,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
three of them are translational
modes.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Why do we have three
translational modes?

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
We have three translational
modes because we are operating

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:48.000
in a three-dimensional space.
If we have a molecule here,

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
that molecule has motion in the
x direction, in the y direction,

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:57.000
and also in the z direction.
Those are the three

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
translational modes of the
molecule.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
What that means then,
if three of the modes are used

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
up for translation,
then we must have 3N minus 3

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000
internal modes.
3N minus 3 must be the number

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000
of modes that is leftover for
the internal degrees of freedom

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:33.000
for rotation and also for
vibration.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
And what we are going to see,
next time, is that these

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:46.000
internal degrees of freedom,
these internal modes are going

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:51.000
to be quantized.
That is, this molecule is going

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:59.000
to be able to vibrate with only
certain amounts of energy.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
There is going to be a ground
vibrational state.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:07.000
There is going to be a first
excited vibrational state.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:12.000
A second excited vibrational
state, just like we talked about

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:17.000
the energy levels of a hydrogen
atom, where the electron was

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
bound with different amounts of
energy dictated by a principle

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.000
quantum number.
The vibrational degree of

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:30.000
freedom is also going to be
dictated by a vibrational

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
quantum number.
In addition,

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
the rotations of the molecules,
they are also quantized.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
A molecule is going to be able
to rotate with only one energy,

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000
or another energy,
or another energy,

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
but not any energies in
between.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000
There are discrete rotational
states.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000
We are going to be talking
about another kind of quantum

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:58.000
number.
In that case,

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000
a rotational quantum number.
That is where we are going to

00:49:04.451 --> 00:49:07.000
pick up on Monday.
See you then.

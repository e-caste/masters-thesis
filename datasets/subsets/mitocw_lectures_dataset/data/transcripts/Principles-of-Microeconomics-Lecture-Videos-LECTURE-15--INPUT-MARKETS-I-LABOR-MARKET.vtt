JONATHAN GRUBER:
All right, let's

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.570
get started today with our
lecture on factor markets.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.010
So when we talked
about producer theory,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.670
we talked about input
prices, that firms

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.432
had prices for their
wages and their capital.

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:32.140
And we just sort of
posed those as given.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.932
I just sort of gave
you values for the wage

00:00:33.932 --> 00:00:35.430
and the renter rate of capital.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.360
But we never really talked about
where those prices come from.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.360
Given that they may be
the most important prices

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.400
in our whole economy,
it's probably worth

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.680
spending a little time
on talking about where

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.780
do w and r actually come from.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.030
And that's we'll do for
the next three lectures,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.270
is talk about factor markets,
talk about the markets

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.860
that give us the price
of labor and capital.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.440
We're going to start
by talking about factor

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.065
demand, the general demand
for labor and capital.

00:01:04.065 --> 00:01:06.190
And then we'll move on to
talk about factor supply,

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.852
where does supply come from.

00:01:07.852 --> 00:01:09.310
We'll then develop
the equilibrium,

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.790
and that will tell us where
wages and the interest rate

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.892
come from.

00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:15.850
So that's sort of the
map of where we're going,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.980
is we're basically
going to develop

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.490
the markets that give us the
wage rate and the interest

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.490
rate.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:29.060
So let's start with factor
demand, factor demand.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.450
And let's start, and
we're going to start

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.728
with the cleanest case.

00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:36.020
We're going to assume that
factor markets are perfectly

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.350
competitive.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590
So unless I say
otherwise, we're assuming

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.990
the market for
workers, or the market

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.450
for machines, or capital,
is perfectly competitive.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.510
OK, we'll come back and bend
that a little bit later.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.770
So what that means is that
there's basically many sellers

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.390
and buyers, OK?

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.360
So any worker is
basically competing

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.210
with lots of workers for jobs.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.160
Any firm is competing
with lots of firms

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.913
to hire the workers, OK?

00:02:04.913 --> 00:02:05.830
And we're also going--

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.610
we're going to assume a
perfectly competitive input

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.310
market, that is lots
of firms and workers

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.135
competing to match
with each other.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.510
We're also going to assume a
perfectly competitive output

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.740
market, that is, we're going
to examine this for the case

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.970
not of a monopoly firm but of
a perfectly competitive firm.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.470
So just think of this, you have
a perfectly competitive firm

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.910
competing with lots of other
firms to hire workers, OK?

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.180
So let's start by talking
about short run labor

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.950
demand in this context.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.210
Let's talk about short
run labor demand.

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.260
Now, in the short
run, capital is fixed.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.320
So our decision is just, do
we add another worker or not,

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.750
or another hour of labor or not.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.850
Like I said, the units
don't really matter here,

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.620
but let's take in
terms of workers.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.500
Do we add another worker or not?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.843
Well, as with everything
else in this course,

00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:01.510
we want to consider the marginal
benefits and the marginal costs

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.580
of that decision.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.230
The marginal benefit
of an extra worker

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.580
is that one extra unit of
labor raises productivity

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.760
by the marginal
product of labor, OK?

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.910
One more unit of labor
raises our output

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.200
by the marginal
product of labor, OK?

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.660
But that's not the only
part of the benefit,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.900
because we don't actually
care as a firm about units

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.720
of output.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.700
We care about revenues.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.320
So the benefit of a worker is
not just the how many units

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.580
it produces, but the
value of those units.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.700
And what is the value of
the next unit produced?

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.760
It's the marginal revenue.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.270
So the value of the
next unit of labor

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.635
is what we call the marginal
revenue product, MRP sub

00:03:55.635 --> 00:03:57.530
L. The marginal
revenue product is

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:02.340
the marginal product of
labor times marginal revenue.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.430
That's the benefit of
another unit of labor.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.340
It's not just what they
make, but what it's worth.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.860
It's not just what they make,
but what it's worth, OK?

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.833
So that's the marginal benefit.

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:18.250
The value of another
unit of labor

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.130
is it makes marginal revenue
product amount more stuff,

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.233
and you sell that at
the marginal revenue.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:26.400
That's the marginal benefit.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.035
What's the marginal cost
of another unit of labor?

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:31.410
So this is the marginal benefit
of another unit of labor.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.610
What's the marginal cost?

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.500
Well, the marginal cost
of labor is just the wage.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.730
So we simply set this
equal to the wage.

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.920
We set the marginal
revenue product of labor

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:45.670
equal to the wage, and that
gives us our optimization

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.930
condition for the
optimal amount of labor

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.040
the firms want to demand--

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.980
is to set the marginal
revenue product of labor

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.880
equal to the wage.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.850
Marginal benefits of hiring
another unit of labor

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.010
equals the marginal cost of
hiring of the unit of labor.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.920
Now to go further,
remember, I said

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.273
this is a perfectly
competitive output market.

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:10.690
So what is the marginal revenue
in a perfectly competitive

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.510
output market?

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.910
What's the marginal revenue
of a firm producing-- yeah.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:15.600
Price.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.540
So I can write this
more to say that I

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.140
want to set the marginal product
of labor times the price equal

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.380
to the wage, OK?

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.450
So basically, what
we're saying here--

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:32.800
think about it-- is hire workers
until the cost of the next unit

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.430
of labor is the same as
what that unit will actually

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.700
produce for you, OK?

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.190
The next unit of
labor costs you w.

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.680
It produces for you MPL times p.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.990
So you want to hire workers
until that condition is

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.820
met, OK?

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:53.640
So think about that, and figure
15-1 sort of shows this, OK?

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:57.410
We have a supply of labor.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:59.790
In 15-1, that's
horizontal, because we're

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.462
assuming competitive
market for workers, OK?

00:06:03.462 --> 00:06:04.920
We're assuming a
competitive market

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.200
for workers, that is a
perfectly competitive market.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.550
So if I try to pay workers one
penny more than other firms,

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.100
every worker in the world
will want to work for me.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.920
If I pay workers one penny
less than other firms,

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.140
no workers will
want to work for me.

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:21.270
That's what a perfectly
competitive labor market

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:25.590
means, that literally, I am
a price taker in the input

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.820
market.

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.510
I don't get to set the wage, OK?

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.740
I don't get to set the wage.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.890
The wage is given to
me by the labor market.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.222
So just like a perfectly
competitive firm

00:06:38.222 --> 00:06:40.180
doesn't get to set the
price of their product--

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.660
it's given to them by
the competitive market.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.970
A perfectly competitive
firm in the input market

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:47.220
doesn't get to set
the wage they pay.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.230
It's given them through
the kind of process

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:53.580
that delivered us our prices
on the output side, OK?

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.790
So we get a horizontal
labor supply curve.

00:06:56.790 --> 00:07:00.390
And then we have this downward
sloping labor demand curve.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:01.670
Why is it downward sloping?

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.240
Someone raise their
hand and tell me.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.970
Why is the labor demand
curve downward sloping?

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:09.110
Yeah.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.470
AUDIENCE: Marginal product
of labor is diminishing.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.512
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:07:12.512 --> 00:07:14.740
The diminishing marginal
product of labor

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.380
means you have a
downward sloping

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.390
marginal benefit of labor.

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:21.560
Each additional-- remember,
holding capital fixed

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:23.380
is only one shovel.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.990
So each additional
worker add less and less

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.630
to digging that hole, OK?

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:30.100
So marginal product
is diminishing.

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.830
Since p is a constant,
that doesn't really

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.692
affect the slope.

00:07:33.692 --> 00:07:34.900
I mean, it affects the slope.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:37.030
It doesn't really
affect the sign.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.235
Doesn't affect the sign.

00:07:38.235 --> 00:07:40.485
It's diminishing because the
marginal product of labor

00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:41.780
is diminishing.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.530
So the equilibrium is
where they intersect.

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:49.610
So the bottom line-- this
is complicated and new--

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.760
the bottom line intuition
is to think about,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.840
as I decide whether to hire
one more hour of work--

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.980
you've got a firm.

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.730
You've got to decide,
do I want the worker

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:00.790
to work one more hour?

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:02.167
You do the tradeoff
of, what am I

00:08:02.167 --> 00:08:04.250
going to pay them for an
hour versus what are they

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.840
going to get me for an hour.

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.090
What they're going to get
me is their marginal product

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.510
times the price, OK?

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.920
Now, that--

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.580
So in other words, the wage is
not just the marginal product.

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:19.280
It's imagining if two workers
were equally productive.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.950
With one more hour of work,
they each make three more units.

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.330
But let's say, in one case, a
unit is a computer chip, OK?

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.700
In another case, a
unit is a potato chip.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:34.086
We clearly would not want to
pay the same wage to someone

00:08:34.086 --> 00:08:36.669
who produces three more computer
chips to someone who produces

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.080
three more potato chips.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.790
We'd want to pay a
lot more to the person

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:41.873
to do more computer chips.

00:08:41.873 --> 00:08:42.530
Why?

00:08:42.530 --> 00:08:44.070
Not because computers
are inherently valuable.

00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:45.945
In fact, potato chips
are much more delicious

00:08:45.945 --> 00:08:47.480
than computer chips.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.460
Because they sell
for a higher price.

00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:52.490
So therefore, you'd
want to pay more

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:56.270
to the worker who produces more
units of a more valuable good.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:09:01.145
So let's think about
a sports example, OK?

00:09:01.145 --> 00:09:03.020
And I realize we're all
about baseball today,

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:03.800
as we should be.

00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:04.880
Go, Red Sox.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.410
But let's focus on
basketball for a minute, OK?

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:12.500
Now, imagine you're a owner of
a team in the NBA, the National

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:14.180
Basketball
Association, and you're

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:18.070
trying to decide how much
you pay one of your players.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:22.090
So basically, in that
case, your goal is to--

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.800
your goal is wins.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.593
That's the goal.

00:09:24.593 --> 00:09:27.010
That's the profit you're trying
to maximize, is your wins.

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:29.110
Let's say you're probably
trying to maximize

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.300
your revenues from
ads and stuff,

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.125
but assume that's
proportional to wins.

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:34.750
OK, assume that
basically, the more you

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:36.090
win, the more money you make.

00:09:36.090 --> 00:09:39.400
So let's say the thing you're
trying to maximize is wins, OK?

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.680
So your labor demand,
the marginal product

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.400
you care about, is the
contribution of the next player

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.985
to your win total.

00:09:46.985 --> 00:09:48.110
That's what you care about.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:51.440
The marginal product of labor is
how much does that next player

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.140
add to my win total, OK?

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:57.248
So for example, LeBron James,
the best player in basketball,

00:09:57.248 --> 00:09:58.790
arguably the best
player in history--

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.290
we could have that-- we could
have the LeBron versus Michael

00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.690
debate some other time, OK?

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:07.100
LeBron James makes $31
million, and that's

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.070
because his marginal
product is enormous.

00:10:10.070 --> 00:10:13.520
He adds a huge amount
of wins to any team, OK?

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.395
We'll see with the--

00:10:14.395 --> 00:10:15.770
we'll run the
experiment to watch

00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:18.190
how the Cleveland Cavaliers
tank this year once LeBron

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:20.730
has left, OK?

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:22.860
Now, other players
don't make as much.

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:25.530
Let's compare LeBron
James to Nate Robinson.

00:10:25.530 --> 00:10:27.570
You guys might not
know Nate Robinson is.

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:30.420
He's one of the shortest players
in the history of the NBA

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.960
at a paltry 5'9", which sounds
pretty tall to you and I,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.540
but it's tiny for the NBA.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:37.830
He was a very exciting player.

00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:39.030
It's kind of fun to
watch this little guy

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.988
run among these giants.

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:44.218
But he was just OK.

00:10:44.218 --> 00:10:45.260
He wasn't a great player.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:46.135
He was a fine player.

00:10:46.135 --> 00:10:50.160
He made about $2 million a
year by the end of his career.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.848
So basically, you have
LeBron making 31 million

00:10:52.848 --> 00:10:54.390
and Nate Robinson
making two million,

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:56.598
and that's sort of related
to their marginal product.

00:10:56.598 --> 00:10:58.440
So LeBron adds a lot
more to your wins.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.362
Now, what happened
is Nate Robinson

00:11:00.362 --> 00:11:01.820
quit basketball in
the US, and went

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.697
to play basketball in Israel.

00:11:03.697 --> 00:11:05.030
In Israel, they love basketball.

00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.540
They have a league.

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:07.280
And he went to Israel,
and he was dominant.

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.530
He was the best player in
Israel, because they don't--

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:11.780
it's not as good as the US, OK?

00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.348
So his marginal
product went way up.

00:11:14.348 --> 00:11:15.890
Nate Robinson went
from being someone

00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:18.140
that had a small marginal
product to maybe the highest

00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:22.020
marginal product in the
league, and his wage went down

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.390
from two million to 500,000.

00:11:24.390 --> 00:11:26.890
So this is a situation where
someone's marginal product went

00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:29.680
way up and their wage went down.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.460
Why?

00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.183
Yeah.

00:11:32.183 --> 00:11:34.100
AUDIENCE: Because people
aren't paying as much

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.920
to watch basketball.

00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:37.462
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right, because
the marginal product went up,

00:11:37.462 --> 00:11:39.880
but the price went way down, OK?

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.510
And what we care
about is the wage

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.750
equals to marginal
product times the price.

00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:47.260
So you have a situation where a
player got better but got paid

00:11:47.260 --> 00:11:48.782
less because they got better.

00:11:48.782 --> 00:11:51.240
He moved from making computer
chips to making potato chips,

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.982
OK?

00:11:51.982 --> 00:11:53.440
He moved from a
market where he was

00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.440
earning a valuable commodity
to one where he was

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.130
earning one that was much less.

00:11:58.130 --> 00:12:01.228
So basically, it's a
situation-- that example

00:12:01.228 --> 00:12:02.770
shows why you have
to care about both

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.250
the quantity of the additional
worker and the value of what

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.530
they're producing, OK?

00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:11.070
Any questions about that?

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:11.715
Yeah.

00:12:11.715 --> 00:12:14.417
AUDIENCE: When we talk about
perfectly competitive input

00:12:14.417 --> 00:12:18.228
market, are we saying that
like all of the workers--

00:12:18.228 --> 00:12:20.520
like a single hour of work
regardless of who you get it

00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.100
from is equal, right?

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.100
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, no.

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.660
A single hour of
work is paid equally.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:25.290
It's not equal.

00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:26.110
Marginal product varies.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.400
We're talking about the market.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.650
Let's think about a
perfectly competitive--

00:12:28.650 --> 00:12:29.820
I probably went
too fast with this.

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:31.950
Let's say a perfectly
competitive output market

00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:36.028
is where the firms sell
the goods into a market

00:12:36.028 --> 00:12:37.570
where people have
perfect information

00:12:37.570 --> 00:12:39.510
and can shop across
all firms easily.

00:12:39.510 --> 00:12:41.010
A perfectly competitive
input market

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.040
is where firms hire workers
in a situation workers

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:46.470
have perfect information
and compare across all firms

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:47.610
equally.

00:12:47.610 --> 00:12:50.387
So basically, the point
is, think about a perfectly

00:12:50.387 --> 00:12:51.470
competitive output market.

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.860
People are in a market where
lots of people are shopping,

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:55.330
and all the options
are in front of them.

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:57.747
A perfectly competitive labor
market where you as a worker

00:12:57.747 --> 00:12:59.490
have lots of firms
you can work for,

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.443
and they're all clearly
in front of you,

00:13:01.443 --> 00:13:03.360
and they all offer a
wage, and you can see it.

00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:04.492
AUDIENCE: OK, but
we're not saying

00:13:04.492 --> 00:13:06.725
that the firms have perfect
information across all

00:13:06.725 --> 00:13:08.965
the laborers, and [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:08.965 --> 00:13:10.433
Are we saying if we have the--

00:13:10.433 --> 00:13:11.850
JONATHAN GRUBER:
What we're saying

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:13.680
is-- we're not saying the
firms have perfect information

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:14.970
about the laborers.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:19.580
The firms essentially-- let
me think of the best way

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:20.580
describe this.

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:24.625
So once again, the firms are--
from the firm's perspective,

00:13:24.625 --> 00:13:26.000
they do have
perfect information.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.230
No, the wages
aren't-- yes, right,

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.070
the workers aren't the same.

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.653
They have different
marginal products.

00:13:29.653 --> 00:13:32.880
The firms know you're better
than you or vice versa.

00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.500
But from the firm's
perspective--

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.410
from the workers'
perspective, is

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:38.410
just like, think of the
workers as the consumers

00:13:38.410 --> 00:13:40.035
in a perfect competitive
output market.

00:13:40.035 --> 00:13:41.800
For a perfectly
competitive output market,

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.690
the consumers can easily
shop across all the firms

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:45.750
they might buy from.

00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:47.900
In a perfectly
competitive input market,

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:50.240
workers can easily
shop among all firms

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.580
they might work for, OK?

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:53.980
That's a good question.

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:55.570
Other questions?

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:57.910
OK, now let's think
about the long run.

00:13:57.910 --> 00:13:59.122
This is the short run.

00:13:59.122 --> 00:14:01.330
Let's think for a minute
about long run labor demand.

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:06.220
Think for a second about
long run labor demand.

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.095
Well, what's different?

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:10.220
The only thing that's
different is in the long run,

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:12.365
capital can adjust as well.

00:14:12.365 --> 00:14:13.990
The only thing
different about the long

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.100
run-- all the intuition,
everything's the same.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:19.400
It's just that capital
can adjust as well.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.640
And what this means
is that long run labor

00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:27.570
demand is more elastic than
short run labor demand, OK?

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:32.740
So we could see this
in figure 15-2, OK?

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.470
So the figure shows two
different short run labor

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:38.320
demand curves at two
different levels of capital.

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:46.070
So the short run labor
demand when k bar equals 32

00:14:46.070 --> 00:14:47.790
is that lower one.

00:14:47.790 --> 00:14:49.840
The short run labor demand
when k bar equals 108

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.800
is the higher one.

00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:55.210
And what this says
is, in the short run,

00:14:55.210 --> 00:14:57.730
you've got these two
labor demand curves.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:14:59.830
In the long run, you
could optimize capital.

00:14:59.830 --> 00:15:02.110
You can pick a point
on either curve,

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:04.870
depending on which level
of capital you choose.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:07.390
And by definition,
that allows you be more

00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.270
elastic at choosing your labor.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.810
You're more flexible
because you can

00:15:10.810 --> 00:15:13.870
optimize not just over workers,
but over machines as well.

00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:15.370
It's the same
intuition we developed

00:15:15.370 --> 00:15:17.453
before talking about short
run and long run costs,

00:15:17.453 --> 00:15:19.880
that the long run cost
curve was a lower envelope

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.250
than the short run cost curve.

00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:21.940
Same thing here.

00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.440
This applies that
the long run labor

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:27.568
demand is more elastic, because
I basically am more flexible.

00:15:27.568 --> 00:15:29.110
I not only can choose
a longer curve,

00:15:29.110 --> 00:15:30.812
I can choose which curve I use.

00:15:30.812 --> 00:15:32.770
And by definition, that
means that the long run

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.700
is more elastic, OK?

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.330
Just a small sort
of side point there.

00:15:37.330 --> 00:15:39.970
Now, the last thing I
want to talk about here

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:41.020
is capital demand.

00:15:43.493 --> 00:15:45.660
We talked about short run
and long run labor demand.

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.570
Let's talk about capital demand.

00:15:47.570 --> 00:15:50.030
It basically is the same thing.

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.940
Capital demand is the
exact same intuition.

00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:56.180
You want to get machines
until the marginal product

00:15:56.180 --> 00:15:59.720
of capital, marginal
product of the next machine,

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:05.950
times the price you get for your
good equals the interest rate.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.277
It's the same condition.

00:16:07.277 --> 00:16:09.360
So we want to hire workers
so the marginal product

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.150
of the labor times the price of
our good equals the wage rate.

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:15.422
We want to invest
in more machines

00:16:15.422 --> 00:16:16.880
until the margin
product of capital

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.290
of the next machine times
the price for our goods

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:21.500
is equal to the interest rate.

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.690
So it's exact same logic.

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:23.490
Here's the marginal cost.

00:16:23.490 --> 00:16:24.870
The next unit of
capital-- remember,

00:16:24.870 --> 00:16:26.120
we talked about the intuition.

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.360
You're always renting things.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.980
So thinking about
renting a machine,

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.620
the next machine
costs are to rent.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:32.640
Do you want to rent it?

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.690
Well, it depends.

00:16:33.690 --> 00:16:37.320
What will it produce, and what
can you sell that stuff for?

00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.990
So you rent the next machine
if the marginal product

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.790
of capital, if the
goods it produces,

00:16:41.790 --> 00:16:43.680
times what you sell
those goods for, you

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.880
want to do that until that
equals the interest rate, OK?

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:49.970
Questions about that?

00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:50.568
Yeah.

00:16:50.568 --> 00:16:53.315
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
machine that you buy and own?

00:16:53.315 --> 00:16:54.190
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.840
We're going to talk about that
a lot starting next lecture.

00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:58.480
Right now, I think I'll
just put this down here.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.980
We'll come back to
it, but I'm going

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.270
to focus on labor
for this lecture, OK?

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:05.964
So let's focus on labor, and
let's-- so I just put that

00:17:05.964 --> 00:17:08.089
down, and we'll back to
capital, but focus on labor

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:10.589
for a minute, and make sure to
understand where labor demand

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:11.359
comes from.

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:15.290
Now let's talk about where
does labor supply come from.

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:17.450
We talked about,
at the firm level,

00:17:17.450 --> 00:17:18.970
labor supply is
perfectly elastic.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:20.599
So go back to figure 15-1.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:23.810
That was a firm level curve, OK?

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.400
That was a firm level curve.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.273
That's a perfectly elastic
labor supply to a firm,

00:17:28.273 --> 00:17:29.690
but that doesn't
mean labor supply

00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:31.580
to the market's
perfectly elastic.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.850
So now we want to derive
market labor supply.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:37.550
So I'll call this
deriving market labor

00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:46.610
supply, deriving market
labor supply, OK?

00:17:46.610 --> 00:17:51.020
Now, this is basically
the question of,

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.463
how do we model how hard
people want to work?

00:17:53.463 --> 00:17:54.880
This is, once
again, getting where

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:58.190
the economics is exciting, OK?

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.720
You sort of knew that economics
was involved in how much Ford

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.342
charged for a car,
but you might not

00:18:04.342 --> 00:18:06.050
have thought so much
about that economics

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:10.020
was involved in deciding how
hard you work, but it is.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.490
And we're going to use the
same tools of consumer choice.

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:15.920
Indeed, I used to teach this
as an application of consumer

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.280
choice, and now I teach it here,
because it's the same tools

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.360
of consumer choice.

00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.410
But now, consumers, instead of
choosing good A versus good B,

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:28.540
are going to choose how hard
they're going to work, OK?

00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:33.690
So basically, like any
choice, there's a tradeoff.

00:18:33.690 --> 00:18:34.710
There's a tradeoff.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:40.110
On the one hand, if you work
harder, you get more stuff.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.460
So you bring home more income.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.280
You can buy more
pizzas and cookies, OK?

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.380
Remember, we talked about
income as a fixed thing

00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:48.590
your parents gave you, but
in reality, sorry, kids,

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:51.120
you're going to have to
make your own money someday.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.130
In reality, you're going
to make a Y. It's not

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.180
going to be given to you.

00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.860
And so if you want to buy
more pizza and cookies,

00:18:55.860 --> 00:18:57.777
you're going to have to
raise your Y. It's not

00:18:57.777 --> 00:18:59.430
going to be given, OK?

00:18:59.430 --> 00:19:01.240
So the reason you
want to work harder

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.300
is to buy more
pizza and cookies.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.400
The reason you don't
want to work harder

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.100
is because you're not
an MIT student, OK?

00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.760
That is, normal people actually
don't like work, newsflash.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.080
OK?

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.780
Normal people
actually like leisure.

00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:18.980
There's a thing called
leisure, it turns out,

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.790
and normal people like it, OK?

00:19:21.790 --> 00:19:23.440
So the tradeoff for
regular people--

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.530
so it's a hard
thing teach at MIT--

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:29.778
is that basically, the
tradeoff is if you work harder,

00:19:29.778 --> 00:19:31.570
you get more stuff,
but you spend more time

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:33.860
doing something you
don't want to do.

00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:35.505
Now, this is weird.

00:19:35.505 --> 00:19:37.150
When we talked about
tradeoffs before,

00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:39.580
we talked about the tradeoff
between goods, pizza

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:40.210
and cookies.

00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:41.710
Now we're talking
about the tradeoff

00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:43.660
between a good and a bad.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:45.460
The good is more stuff to eat.

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:47.590
The bad is working harder,
and we don't really

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:49.330
know how to model that.

00:19:49.330 --> 00:19:51.640
So the trick we're
going to use here

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:55.030
is we're going to flip
the bad into a good.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:59.940
Instead of modeling labor,
we're going to model leisure.

00:19:59.940 --> 00:20:03.650
So to get labor supply, we're
going to model leisure supply,

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.400
and then just flip it around
to get labor supply, OK?

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:13.400
So that is, we're going to say,
your ultimate labor supply,

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.760
the amount of hours you
work, the amount you work,

00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:19.280
the amount of hours
you work, call them H,

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:28.760
is equal to 24 minus leisure.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:32.240
Let's call it leisure, because
leisure's called little l.

00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.470
Leisure's little l.

00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:36.260
The amount of hours you work is
24 minus the hours of leisure

00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:37.490
you take.

00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:41.450
What that means is I don't
have to model the bad.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:45.200
I can model the good and just
use this simple reflection

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:47.708
equation to get the bad, OK?

00:20:47.708 --> 00:20:49.125
So this is the
trick in economics.

00:20:49.125 --> 00:20:50.390
It's a good modeling trick.

00:20:50.390 --> 00:20:51.545
We don't model bad
so we don't have

00:20:51.545 --> 00:20:53.100
to do the tradeoff between
the bad and the good.

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:55.225
We don't have to do the
tradeoff between two goods.

00:20:55.225 --> 00:20:56.480
So turn the bad into a good.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.200
Don't model work, model leisure.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.700
Don't model your hours
you work, model how many

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.710
hours of leisure, OK?

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:05.160
This is a general
modeling trick.

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.860
So what we want to
ask is, now, not how

00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.780
do you derive the
supply of labor,

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.190
how do you derive the
demand for leisure?

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.230
How do we derive how
much leisure people want?

00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:18.927
Well, once I say it that
way, you know what to do,

00:21:18.927 --> 00:21:20.010
which is what I just said.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:23.490
There are two goods,
consumption and leisure.

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:25.440
I wonder how much of
one good you choose--

00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.490
of each good you choose.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.830
Well, that's a consumer
choice problem.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.110
You know how to do that, OK?

00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:36.430
So basically, take
figure 15-3, OK?

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:40.570
In figure 15-3, now, instead
of doing pizza versus cookies,

00:21:40.570 --> 00:21:42.360
now our decision
is all consumption.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.360
So we're thinking about
consumption as a bundle,

00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:47.240
OK, versus leisure.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.490
So on the y-axis is
the goods you choose.

00:21:51.490 --> 00:21:55.560
On the x-axis is how much
leisure you take, OK?

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.070
It says N but actually it
should be little l, OK?

00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:00.900
Should be little l.

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.230
So let's call that little l, OK?

00:22:03.230 --> 00:22:08.560
So basically, as you go
more positive on the x-axis,

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.610
that's more leisure.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:11.380
But because this
equation, that implies

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:14.200
as you go to the left on the
axis, that's more work, OK?

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.820
Yeah.

00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.360
H is hours of work.

00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:18.260
H is hours of work.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.353
So as you go to the
left, you work more.

00:22:20.353 --> 00:22:22.270
As you go to the right,
you take more leisure.

00:22:22.270 --> 00:22:24.500
But we're modeling the
good, which is leisure.

00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.600
And then we just go
to our standard--

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.990
we go to our standard
consumer choice equation.

00:22:31.990 --> 00:22:34.180
We have a budget
constraint and preferences.

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:38.730
The indifference curve comes
from your utility function.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:44.430
It comes from your indifference
between how much you consume

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:45.897
and how much leisure you take.

00:22:45.897 --> 00:22:48.480
And the indifference curve comes
from like any consumer choice

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:49.017
decision.

00:22:49.017 --> 00:22:51.100
But instead of choosing
between pizza and cookies,

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.920
now it's how much stuff you
want versus how much leisure you

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.070
want to take.

00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:56.220
So it's the same sort
of indifference curve.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:23:01.840
The budget constraint comes
from what the market tells

00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:04.420
you is the cost of leisure.

00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:07.790
What is the price of leisure?

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:10.928
What is the price of leisure?

00:23:10.928 --> 00:23:11.470
Someone else?

00:23:11.470 --> 00:23:12.760
Someone else got it?

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.330
Yeah,

00:23:13.330 --> 00:23:14.010
AUDIENCE: Your wage.

00:23:14.010 --> 00:23:14.380
JONATHAN GRUBER: Your wage.

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:15.755
Why is that the
price of leisure?

00:23:15.755 --> 00:23:17.338
AUDIENCE: Because
every hour you don't

00:23:17.338 --> 00:23:19.340
work is another hour
of wage you don't get.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.340
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Which we call what?

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:21.880
AUDIENCE: Opportunity cost.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:22.250
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Opportunity cost.

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:24.190
Remember, prices
and opportunity cost

00:23:24.190 --> 00:23:25.780
are the same thing in economics.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:28.405
Here's once again where it gets
interesting to apply what we've

00:23:28.405 --> 00:23:30.130
learned, which is
that basically, this

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:32.680
is why, once again, they call
economics the dismal science.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.470
Instead of having
fun sitting around,

00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:36.790
we're telling you,
you know, by the way,

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.440
you could be working
and making a wage.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.940
So you're actually spending
money by taking leisure.

00:23:41.940 --> 00:23:43.710
By taking leisure, you
are spending money.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:44.910
What are you spending?

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.950
You're spending the money
you could be earning.

00:23:47.950 --> 00:23:51.270
So the opportunity--
so leisure has a price,

00:23:51.270 --> 00:23:54.150
and the price of
leisure is the wage.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.340
It's what you could be
earning if you were working.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:00.210
So the budget constraint
has the slope of minus w.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.250
So if you look at the
budget constraint,

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:05.250
you could take 24
hours of leisure

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.920
and have zero consumption, OK?

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.530
That's the x-axis intercept.

00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:17.460
Or you take no leisure and have
24w worth of consumption, OK?

00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:21.528
So basically, that is
the tradeoff you face.

00:24:21.528 --> 00:24:23.320
One other modeling
trick-- couple of them--

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.820
so a couple of
modeling tricks here.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:28.840
Modeling trick one is modeling
the good, not the bad, OK?

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:33.105
Modeling trick two is, I
wrote on the x-axis goods,

00:24:33.105 --> 00:24:34.480
but we don't think
in quantities,

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:36.080
we think in dollars.

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.580
So to make life
easier, I just said,

00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:41.190
let's assume the price of
the average good is $1.

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:42.480
That way you can--

00:24:42.480 --> 00:24:45.810
that's called-- that's
just a normalization, OK,

00:24:45.810 --> 00:24:48.060
which allows you to think
in terms of dollars of goods

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:49.310
rather than quantity of goods.

00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:51.060
That's another modeling
trick we'll do.

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:53.788
We call it making a
numerator good, OK?

00:24:53.788 --> 00:24:55.330
You don't have to
remember that term,

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:56.705
but the point is
a trick we'll do

00:24:56.705 --> 00:24:58.660
is we want to model
dollars, not quantities.

00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:00.580
We just make the
quantities cost $1,

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:03.030
and then we can model
quantities basically as dollars.

00:25:03.030 --> 00:25:04.363
So that's the trick we're doing.

00:25:04.363 --> 00:25:07.150
So the y-axis is dollars,
but it's also quantities,

00:25:07.150 --> 00:25:10.052
because we made the price
of everything be $1, OK?

00:25:10.052 --> 00:25:12.010
It's just another trick
that makes life easier.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:15.140
OK, so two modeling tricks
here, the numerator trick,

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:18.760
which is making the price $1
so quantities become dollars,

00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.460
and the bad is good trick,
which is model the good,

00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:23.410
and then reverse
that to get the bad.

00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:25.360
Having done that,
we know what to do.

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.550
We get an optimum,
which is the tendency

00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:30.730
between the indifference curve
and the budget constraint,

00:25:30.730 --> 00:25:32.550
and we're done.

00:25:32.550 --> 00:25:33.630
And so what do you do?

00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.550
You choose-- we're going to call
this L. We'll call it little l.

00:25:36.550 --> 00:25:40.650
You choose little l
star hours of leisure,

00:25:40.650 --> 00:25:45.660
which means you choose 24 minus
little l star hours of work,

00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:46.190
OK?

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:47.210
So basically, you sat down.

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:48.627
You made the
decision, how much do

00:25:48.627 --> 00:25:51.520
I want to eat versus how
much do I want to watch TV.

00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:54.680
You make that tradeoff, and that
determines how hard you work,

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.700
OK?

00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:56.680
Now-- yeah.

00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:03.230
AUDIENCE: Aren't there things
that are kind of necessary?

00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:06.220
Like for example, if
you wanted to-- like

00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:11.213
if your preference was
completely to work,

00:26:11.213 --> 00:26:13.130
then wouldn't we be like
an inefficient worker

00:26:13.130 --> 00:26:14.110
if we didn't sleep?

00:26:14.110 --> 00:26:14.862
Doesn't--

00:26:14.862 --> 00:26:16.570
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
and in some sense,

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:19.610
that would be in your
utility function,

00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:21.240
or it would be in
your utility function

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.490
and/or your budget constraint.

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:23.900
That would be true, absolutely.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.492
But that would be a feature.

00:26:25.492 --> 00:26:27.450
That wouldn't change this
maximization problem.

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:28.867
It'd just change
general structure

00:26:28.867 --> 00:26:32.830
of the equations that go into
the maximization problem, OK?

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:37.197
So basically, now, what's really
interesting about this is now

00:26:37.197 --> 00:26:39.280
we finally understand why
we learned all that shit

00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.963
about income and
substitution effects.

00:26:40.963 --> 00:26:42.880
Remember, let's think
of substitution effects.

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.880
And you're probably saying
like, "Why do I care?

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.628
Price goes up.

00:26:45.628 --> 00:26:46.420
Quantity goes down.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:47.350
Why do I care?"

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:53.350
Here's why you care, because now
it gets really interesting, OK?

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.690
Because when we're doing
substitution effects

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.670
for a good, they work together.

00:26:57.670 --> 00:27:00.623
As long as the good was
normal, they work together.

00:27:00.623 --> 00:27:03.040
When the price went up, you
substituted away from the good

00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.350
and you are poor.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:06.370
So it gets substituted
down for two reasons.

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:13.970
Now, a normal leisure effect
is an inferior labor effect.

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:19.040
What I mean by that is that
when your wage goes up,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:22.220
you work more through the
substitution effect, but now

00:27:22.220 --> 00:27:23.780
you're richer.

00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.820
And when you're richer,
you buy more of everything,

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.530
including leisure.

00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.820
So if you take more
leisure, you do less labor.

00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.870
So the income effect naturally
goes against the substitution

00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:35.370
effect.

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:36.240
I'll go through this
a couple of times.

00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.060
Don't worry.

00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:39.260
The income effect naturally goes
against the substitution effect

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:39.860
here.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.200
For consumption goods,
the income effect

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.910
naturally work together, OK?

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.180
We almost never saw sort
of a Giffen good type

00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:49.610
phenomenon, where the
effect could sort of switch

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:50.960
the overall effect.

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.520
For labor, that's
much more likely,

00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:58.370
and it's much more likely not
because of any inferior good.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:00.470
It's because leisure
is a normal good,

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.940
and labor is the
opposite of leisure.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:04.590
So once again, let
me say it again.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:06.820
The wage goes up.

00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:11.590
The substitution effect--
think of leisure as a good.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.350
When the wage goes up, that's
the price of leisure going up.

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:17.660
When the price of
a good goes up,

00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:21.220
the substitution effects
says you want less of it, OK?

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:26.980
So when the wage goes up,
the substitution effect

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:31.530
says that leisure
goes down, right?

00:28:31.530 --> 00:28:33.300
Because you want to
substitute-- wait,

00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.160
leisure just got more expensive.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.260
You now feel worse sitting
around watching TV,

00:28:37.260 --> 00:28:39.570
because you could be out
there making more money.

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.264
Yeah.

00:28:41.264 --> 00:28:43.256
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
income-- [COUGHS]

00:28:43.256 --> 00:28:43.760
JONATHAN GRUBER: I haven't
got to income effect.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.395
Let me finish, then
you can ask it.

00:28:45.395 --> 00:28:46.640
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't
income effect be--

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:47.640
JONATHAN GRUBER: I haven't
gotten to the income effects.

00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.460
Let me ask finish, then
you can ask it, OK?

00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:54.990
So the substitution effect says
that leisure goes down, OK?

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:01.250
The income effect says
that you are richer, right?

00:29:01.250 --> 00:29:02.710
Your wage went up.

00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:03.950
You're richer.

00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:07.630
When you're richer, you want
more of all normal goods.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:12.160
Leisure for non-MIT
students is a normal good.

00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.380
So you want more of it.

00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:20.920
So here, with consumption
goods, when they were normal,

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.770
the income and substitution
effects work together.

00:29:23.770 --> 00:29:27.163
With labor and leisure,
they work opposite.

00:29:27.163 --> 00:29:28.830
So what this is, the
substitution effect

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:32.320
says take more leisure,
which means work--

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.170
take less leisure means work
harder, work more hours.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.120
But the income effect
says take more leisure,

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.420
which means work less hours.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:44.083
So you don't know what
the net effect is.

00:29:44.083 --> 00:29:46.250
So that's why we do income
and substitution effects,

00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:48.070
because in a case like this,
they get much more interesting.

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.028
Yes, now your question.

00:29:49.028 --> 00:29:52.310
AUDIENCE: Is this income effect
in terms of income over time?

00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:53.870
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, this is
your income, your actual cash

00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:54.380
income.

00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:57.140
You are now richer,
and when you're richer,

00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:58.520
you spend more on everything.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:29:59.280
So think of it this way.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.910
Once again, imagine
you're not an MIT student.

00:30:00.910 --> 00:30:01.960
You're a normal guy.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.260
OK, if we won the lottery,
if you guys won the lottery,

00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.520
you would use that
to do a startup.

00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:09.240
If a normal person
won the lottery,

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.440
they'd use it to not work, OK?

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.928
That's the income effect.

00:30:13.928 --> 00:30:15.470
OK, when normal
people win lotteries,

00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:16.970
they don't go work harder.

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.040
They don't work, OK?

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:20.270
So that's the point.

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:23.130
You are now richer
because your wage went up.

00:30:23.130 --> 00:30:25.550
So you work less,
and that offsets it.

00:30:25.550 --> 00:30:27.180
So let's show this in a graph.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:29.555
Let's go back to our income
and substitution effect graph

00:30:29.555 --> 00:30:33.108
that we did before,
figure 15-4, OK?

00:30:33.108 --> 00:30:33.900
Now we're back to--

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:36.870
once again, this is just
applied consumer theory, OK?

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:39.270
Let's go back to the income
and substitution effects.

00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.840
We start with budget
constraint one at wage one,

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:47.630
and we have our initial tangency
at A, OK, with leisure of N1

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:50.450
or little l1.

00:30:50.450 --> 00:30:53.450
Now our wage goes up.

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:54.260
Our wage goes up.

00:30:54.260 --> 00:30:56.880
Therefore, the budget
constraint pivots up.

00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.250
Think of what that means.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.500
You can still only have
24 hours of leisure.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.090
That's a fixed point.

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:06.290
But as you take less
leisure, you make more money.

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.510
So the budget trade
now pivots up.

00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:10.340
Well, that has two effects.

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.980
The first is the
substitution effect.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:14.090
Remember how we get that.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.370
We draw an imaginary
budget constraint

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:18.812
at the new price ratio.

00:31:18.812 --> 00:31:20.270
The price ratio is
just W because I

00:31:20.270 --> 00:31:22.570
assume the price of goods is 1.

00:31:22.570 --> 00:31:25.390
The new price ratio, tangent
to the old indifference

00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:29.970
curve, that is point B. So
the substitution effect says,

00:31:29.970 --> 00:31:35.000
take less leisure, OK?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.660
The price of leisure has gone
up, so holding utility costs,

00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.760
you want to take less leisure.

00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.560
The income effect,
however, says,

00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.326
you are now richer
so take more leisure.

00:31:46.326 --> 00:31:48.450
So the income effect
goes the opposite way

00:31:48.450 --> 00:31:50.440
of the substitution
effect naturally.

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:52.440
You don't need a weird
thing for that to happen,

00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.790
like with pizza and cookies.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.680
It comes naturally.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.370
So for normal goods, the income
effect goes the opposite way.

00:31:59.370 --> 00:32:03.150
Now, in this case, we end up
with leisure still going down.

00:32:03.150 --> 00:32:06.060
We end up with, the wage
goes up, leisure goes down,

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.612
and therefore labor
supply goes up.

00:32:07.612 --> 00:32:09.570
So we end up with our
standard intuition, which

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:11.220
is, I tell you, if I'm
going to pay you more,

00:32:11.220 --> 00:32:12.928
you're going to work
harder or less hard?

00:32:12.928 --> 00:32:16.280
The standard intuition
is I work more hard, OK?

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.910
But as figure 15-5
shows, it would not

00:32:19.910 --> 00:32:24.520
be super odd to get a
Giffen good effect here,

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:27.430
which is, the wage goes up.

00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:29.740
The substitution effect
shifts you to the left,

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.620
but the income effect shifts
you even more to the right,

00:32:32.620 --> 00:32:37.380
and you actually end
up with more leisure.

00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.910
So once again, my intuition, if
I say to you the price of pizza

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:43.310
went up, what happens to
your demand for pizza?

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:45.250
You think of a standard--
you say, "Well, I'm

00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:46.580
going to demand less pizza."

00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.260
If I say to you
the wage went up,

00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.570
what happened to
how hard you work?

00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.980
It's not clear.

00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:55.080
Think of a simple example.

00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:56.843
Think of yourself
actually back before you

00:32:56.843 --> 00:32:58.260
were an MIT student,
when you were

00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:00.330
a kid saving for something.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:04.910
You were saving to buy a
bike, and the bike was $150.

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:09.500
OK, bike was $200, and you're
earning $10 an hour, OK?

00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.550
So you had to work 20
hours to get the bike.

00:33:12.550 --> 00:33:16.270
Now I gave you a
raise to 15 hours--

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:19.360
to $15 an hour or $20 an hour.

00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:21.670
Would you work
harder or less hard?

00:33:21.670 --> 00:33:24.207
Well, if all you want is the
bike, you'd work less hard.

00:33:24.207 --> 00:33:25.540
You don't have to work 20 hours.

00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:27.150
You only have to work 10 hours.

00:33:27.150 --> 00:33:29.830
So in fact, a higher wage
caused you to work less hard.

00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:31.690
That's not that
bizarre a case, right?

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:33.190
That makes sense.

00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:36.010
The point is, it's
actually quite sensible

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.620
that you couldn't end up with
the labor supply being a Giffen

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.160
good, with a higher wage
causing you to work less.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.590
It's not a crazy outcome.

00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.790
Giffen goods and
consumer goods are crazy.

00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:48.820
It's not at all crazy
to think that in cases

00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.023
like having a target,
a purchase target,

00:33:51.023 --> 00:33:52.940
a higher wage would cause
people to work less.

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:53.516
Yeah.

00:33:53.516 --> 00:33:58.090
AUDIENCE: So does the law
of nonsatiation not apply?

00:33:58.090 --> 00:34:01.060
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Absolute applies.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:02.075
Absolutely applies.

00:34:02.075 --> 00:34:02.950
There's no violation.

00:34:02.950 --> 00:34:04.630
We haven't violated
any of the laws.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:06.700
All we've done is just
said income effects--

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:08.915
it didn't apply with
Giffen goods too.

00:34:08.915 --> 00:34:11.290
It's all just saying income
effects dominate substitution

00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:12.880
effects, which we
thought was sort

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:15.850
of going to be pretty bizarre
in the consumption good context,

00:34:15.850 --> 00:34:18.562
but it's not at all bizarre
in the labor supply context.

00:34:18.562 --> 00:34:20.130
So this is pretty wild.

00:34:20.130 --> 00:34:22.889
What this says is
that basically, you've

00:34:22.889 --> 00:34:25.830
got a situation where
even in the normal world,

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.330
you can get that
paying workers more

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:32.310
makes them work less, which
is kind of bizarre, OK?

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.727
Questions about that, about
that intuition, or the math,

00:34:34.727 --> 00:34:35.310
or the graphs?

00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:37.040
Well, the math we haven't
done, but the graphs?

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:38.260
We'll do the math on Friday.

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:40.659
The graphs or anything?

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:41.810
OK.

00:34:41.810 --> 00:34:45.230
Let's then say, well, does
that happen in reality?

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:46.440
What does the evidence say?

00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.010
Let's go to the evidence.

00:34:51.010 --> 00:34:53.989
What does the evidence say?

00:34:53.989 --> 00:34:56.480
And there may be sort
of no question more

00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:00.440
worked on in economics than
the elasticity of labor supply

00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:02.880
or the shape of the
labor supply curve.

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:07.530
There is thousands of articles
written on this question, OK?

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:10.810
And what I want to do here
to make the intuition easy,

00:35:10.810 --> 00:35:13.560
I want to go back to
the literature circa

00:35:13.560 --> 00:35:15.143
probably 40 years
ago, when it was

00:35:15.143 --> 00:35:17.060
sort of the initial burst
of interest in this,

00:35:17.060 --> 00:35:18.800
in like the 1970s.

00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.900
In 1970s, there was a
burst of interest in this.

00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:24.170
And what the literature did
was it looked separately

00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:28.100
at men and married women,
because most of women

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:30.840
were married, and back then we
didn't care about single women,

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.520
OK?

00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:36.800
OK, it was a dark time, OK?

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:39.200
So the literature
looked at men and women,

00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.330
and married women,
and asked what

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.420
was their elasticity
of labor supply.

00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.350
Well, let's think for a
second about what we'd expect,

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:51.740
and to do that, let's think
about the substitution effect

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:53.570
and the income effect.

00:35:53.570 --> 00:35:58.962
Let's start with men, the
male substitution effect.

00:35:58.962 --> 00:36:00.170
Let's go substitution effect.

00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:04.080
Men versus married women,
who has a bigger substitution

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:05.400
effect and why?

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:10.500
That is, when the wage goes up,
who has a bigger substitution

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:12.405
response to that and why?

00:36:12.405 --> 00:36:13.280
Men or married women?

00:36:16.490 --> 00:36:18.910
Think about the world--

00:36:18.910 --> 00:36:21.030
think about the Mad
Men world or the world,

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.285
you know, circa 40 years ago.

00:36:22.285 --> 00:36:23.660
You guys seen
enough TV and stuff

00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.387
to know how life was
a little bit, OK?

00:36:26.387 --> 00:36:27.470
So who's going to respond?

00:36:27.470 --> 00:36:28.562
Who's the bigger-- yeah.

00:36:28.562 --> 00:36:30.530
AUDIENCE: Are you assuming
men were primary providers?

00:36:30.530 --> 00:36:32.550
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, they
certainly were in the 1970s.

00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:33.258
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:36:33.258 --> 00:36:34.340
In that case, the men.

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:35.750
JONATHAN GRUBER: Men have a
bigger substitution effect?

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:38.210
AUDIENCE: Yeah, they'll
work more, probably.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.520
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK,
that's one option, yeah.

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.110
AUDIENCE: It'll be married
women, because they're only

00:36:44.110 --> 00:36:45.322
working if they have to.

00:36:45.322 --> 00:36:46.280
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.613
So it's actually married
women, because men were already

00:36:48.613 --> 00:36:50.300
working 40 hours.

00:36:50.300 --> 00:36:52.220
They can't-- there's no--

00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:55.050
So think about a
married man in 1975.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:56.477
OK, men didn't raise their kids.

00:36:56.477 --> 00:36:58.310
Men quite frankly didn't
give much of a shit

00:36:58.310 --> 00:37:00.650
about their kids, OK?

00:37:00.650 --> 00:37:01.670
Men just worked.

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:04.807
That's what men did in 1975, OK?

00:37:04.807 --> 00:37:06.640
They worked, and they
worked their 40 hours,

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.890
and then went home.

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:10.050
OK, maybe they worked less
or more than 40 hours,

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:11.630
but certainly, the
notion of saying,

00:37:11.630 --> 00:37:12.630
"Well, the wage went up.

00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:14.970
Maybe I'll take more
leisure," never really crossed

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:16.712
a man's mind in 1975.

00:37:16.712 --> 00:37:18.170
Because what were
they going to do?

00:37:18.170 --> 00:37:19.628
They have no one
to play golf with.

00:37:19.628 --> 00:37:22.050
They didn't want to spend
time with their kids.

00:37:22.050 --> 00:37:23.610
What were they going to do?

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:28.110
Whereas women had a real
substitution possibility, OK?

00:37:28.110 --> 00:37:31.650
This was an era women were
entering the labor force.

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:33.300
There were real
opportunities for work,

00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.750
but it was also fine
to hang out at home.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:37.260
You had-- a lot of your friends
were hanging out at home.

00:37:37.260 --> 00:37:38.190
You could take care of kids.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:39.750
There were a lot
of things to do.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:46.270
So women had a much larger
substitution effect than men,

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:46.840
OK?

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:50.260
Because men-- remember, what's
the substitution effect?

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.780
It's about the next
best alternative.

00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:54.840
For men, there was no
next best alternative.

00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:55.915
It was just work.

00:37:55.915 --> 00:37:57.790
Basically, between 9:00
to 5:00 on a weekday,

00:37:57.790 --> 00:38:00.280
there was nothing
else to do, OK?

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.980
For women, there was
other things to do,

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.480
which is, you can hang out with
friends who weren't working,

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.170
or you could take
care of the kids.

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:06.670
Yeah.

00:38:06.670 --> 00:38:08.628
AUDIENCE: But what about
like working overtime?

00:38:08.628 --> 00:38:10.790
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK, well,
let's-- but once again,

00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:13.270
if I'm a man, you might
think that I could then--

00:38:13.270 --> 00:38:15.400
but then once again, if I work--

00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.227
the substitution effect could
work that way for overtime.

00:38:18.227 --> 00:38:19.810
But let's talk about
just the decision

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:22.360
to work at all, in some
sense, or the decision

00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.860
to work sort of
your first 40 hours.

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.360
Overtime is hard, because then
you get paid more, et cetera.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:28.340
OK, now let's go
to the other side.

00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:29.810
Let's go to the income effect.

00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:31.150
So let's not say this is zero.

00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:35.205
Let's say it's small, because
this is big and this is small.

00:38:35.205 --> 00:38:36.580
Because you can
work a little bit

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.050
overtime or something
like that, and some men

00:38:38.050 --> 00:38:39.050
did care about the kids.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:40.805
I'm obviously being facetious.

00:38:40.805 --> 00:38:42.930
So it could be, some men
were willing to spend time

00:38:42.930 --> 00:38:44.260
with their kids, et cetera.

00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:48.617
OK, now let's go to
the income effect.

00:38:48.617 --> 00:38:50.075
For whom is the
income effect going

00:38:50.075 --> 00:38:54.570
to be bigger, men or women?

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:57.435
For whom is the income
effect going to be bigger?

00:38:57.435 --> 00:38:58.920
Yeah.

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.080
AUDIENCE: Maybe men.

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:01.160
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because?

00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.410
AUDIENCE: Because they
have a goal of like,

00:39:04.410 --> 00:39:06.230
they need x amount of
money to just provide

00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:07.160
for their families.

00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.310
So if they get this
huge raise in wage,

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.385
then they become wealthier,
and they could start

00:39:12.385 --> 00:39:13.820
doing more leisure in the week.

00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:15.660
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly.

00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.885
There's actually two
reasons it's men.

00:39:17.885 --> 00:39:20.010
One, you're more likely to
have your target income.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:24.000
Two is, you can't have an
income effect if you don't work.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.160
The income effect is
proportional to how hard

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.730
you are working.

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:29.580
If you weren't
working, then there's

00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:30.990
no income effect, right?

00:39:30.990 --> 00:39:33.870
Income effect is essentially--
the income effect for labor

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:38.400
is essentially the
hours times dH dy.

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:43.120
What Manny said
was the reason why

00:39:43.120 --> 00:39:45.367
dH dy might be bigger
for men than women,

00:39:45.367 --> 00:39:46.700
because they have these targets.

00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:48.500
More relevantly, if
women weren't working,

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.042
they didn't have
dH, so this is zero.

00:39:50.042 --> 00:39:51.530
So the income effect is zero.

00:39:51.530 --> 00:39:57.740
So for men, this was big, and
for women, this was small, OK?

00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.720
Put this together,
and what does it

00:39:59.720 --> 00:40:02.810
suggest about the relative
shapes of labor supply for men

00:40:02.810 --> 00:40:03.620
and women?

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.238
Someone raise their
hand and tell me.

00:40:05.238 --> 00:40:07.030
What does it suggests
what the labor supply

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:09.197
curve would look like for
men and women in this era?

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:17.190
OK, given the
intuition we talked

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:19.857
about here, what does it
suggest the female and male--

00:40:19.857 --> 00:40:22.440
the married women labor supply
and the male labor supply curve

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.050
should look like?

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:27.680
You guys can get this, come on.

00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:29.430
Well, let's talk--
what did we talk about?

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:31.940
We talked about the
substitution effect.

00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.910
If the wage goes up, it leads
to more leisure, which means

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:36.910
it leads to more labor supply.

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.660
By the income effect,
if the wage goes up,

00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:41.140
it leads to less labor supply.

00:40:41.140 --> 00:40:42.780
So for men, with--

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.810
for women, with a big
substitution effect

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:50.160
and a small income effect,
this suggests a standard steep

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:51.150
upward--

00:40:51.150 --> 00:40:54.700
standard upward-sloping
supply curve.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.350
Think of the income
effect being zero.

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:58.225
Then we get the standard
substitution effect.

00:40:58.225 --> 00:40:59.590
We know the sign of that.

00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:02.440
So for women, this suggests an
upward-sloping supply curve,

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:04.270
just like a substitution
effect suggests

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.450
a downward-sloping demand curve.

00:41:06.450 --> 00:41:08.860
For men, it's not clear.

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:11.980
You could very much get
a Giffen effect here,

00:41:11.980 --> 00:41:15.010
because basically, there's not
much option for substitution,

00:41:15.010 --> 00:41:19.560
but they might work a lot
less if they get rich, OK?

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:21.290
So that is sort of this--

00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:23.040
what I like with this
example-- it's hard,

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.390
but I like that this
example sort of illustrates

00:41:24.390 --> 00:41:27.060
how substitution and income
effects can come together

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:29.580
to get a bottom line answer.

00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:31.290
What do we know?

00:41:31.290 --> 00:41:34.810
What we know is that actually,
evidence is that female labor

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:37.712
supply was very elastic,
that circa this era,

00:41:37.712 --> 00:41:39.420
female labor supply
was in the elasticity

00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.610
of between 0.5 and 1.

00:41:41.610 --> 00:41:45.660
That if you raised women's wage
by 10%, there was a 5% to 10%

00:41:45.660 --> 00:41:47.400
increase in their
labor supply, which

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:51.900
is pretty not elastic-elastic,
but reasonably elastic, OK?

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.760
Whereas for men it
was pretty much zero.

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:56.618
It wasn't negative.

00:41:56.618 --> 00:41:57.410
It wasn't positive.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:58.460
It was basically zero.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:02.410
Basically, men just worked 40
hours and then went home, OK?

00:42:02.410 --> 00:42:05.890
So basically, in an era where
for women, the labor supply was

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:08.758
very elastic and of
the standard direction,

00:42:08.758 --> 00:42:10.300
higher wages lead
you to work harder,

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:12.758
an upward-sloping supply curve.

00:42:12.758 --> 00:42:14.800
But for men, it was pretty
much a vertical supply

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.720
curve, maybe even a
bit backward bending,

00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:19.240
maybe even a wrong
sign supply curve.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.800
But pretty much, you could
think of it as zero, OK?

00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:26.160
Now, what do we think has
happened in the 40 years

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:28.020
since these two numbers?

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:30.120
So elasticity of woman
of between 0.5 and 1,

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:32.130
and men of zero,
what do we think

00:42:32.130 --> 00:42:34.560
has happened to these two
numbers in the 40 years

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:38.850
since these studies, and why?

00:42:38.850 --> 00:42:41.350
What do you think has happened
to these elasticity estimates

00:42:41.350 --> 00:42:42.480
and why?

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:42.980
Yeah.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.130
AUDIENCE: Are we talking
about these together?

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:45.850
JONATHAN GRUBER: Let's
talk about women.

00:42:45.850 --> 00:42:47.764
What do you think has happened
to the female estimate?

00:42:47.764 --> 00:42:49.420
AUDIENCE: Probably
gotten less elastic.

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:51.530
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because?

00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:53.742
AUDIENCE: More of them are
working in a primary role.

00:42:53.742 --> 00:42:54.700
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:56.075
Well, first of
all, this is going

00:42:56.075 --> 00:42:58.840
to come down, because in fact,
it's now more standard just

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.460
to work, right?

00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:05.122
In fact, now, for a woman
today, in many communities,

00:43:05.122 --> 00:43:06.580
it's like being a
man in 70s, which

00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.038
is if you don't go
to work, there's

00:43:08.038 --> 00:43:10.300
no one to hang out with, OK?

00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.190
So basically, this is
going to get smaller.

00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:14.315
And they're more of a
primary winner in the family.

00:43:14.315 --> 00:43:15.642
This is going to get bigger.

00:43:15.642 --> 00:43:17.600
So in fact, female labor
supply has fallen more

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:19.840
to like about an
elasticity about 0.2.

00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:22.930
It's actually fallen over time.

00:43:22.930 --> 00:43:26.460
Now, for men, the question is,
do you get the opposite effect?

00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.075
Actually, men sort of care
more about their kids now,

00:43:29.075 --> 00:43:31.200
and there's more sort of
activities going on during

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.500
the day, but in fact it hasn't.

00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:37.410
In fact, male labor supply
still is pretty inelastic.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:40.690
What's happened is kids
are now in childcare.

00:43:40.690 --> 00:43:44.900
So basically, we've gone from a
world where, as wages went up,

00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:46.850
women went--

00:43:46.850 --> 00:43:48.063
men worked.

00:43:48.063 --> 00:43:50.480
Women either worked or didn't
work, depending on the wage,

00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.438
and if they worked, the
kids went in childcare.

00:43:52.438 --> 00:43:55.738
Now men work and women work,
and kids are in childcare.

00:43:55.738 --> 00:43:58.280
And that's basically the change,
the evolution of the labor--

00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:00.230
roughly speaking, obviously.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:01.970
Still, female labor
force participation

00:44:01.970 --> 00:44:03.715
is only about 70%, OK?

00:44:03.715 --> 00:44:05.840
Many women still do stay
home and raise their kids,

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:08.330
and are in and out of
the labor force, OK?

00:44:08.330 --> 00:44:09.900
But by and large,
we moved to a world

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:12.870
with just overall less
elastic labor supply.

00:44:12.870 --> 00:44:13.922
Yeah.

00:44:13.922 --> 00:44:18.740
AUDIENCE: Between the average
two-income household is richer

00:44:18.740 --> 00:44:19.370
now, or--

00:44:19.370 --> 00:44:19.690
JONATHAN GRUBER: No.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:20.770
The average-- well,
OK, we're going

00:44:20.770 --> 00:44:23.360
to get into this when we talk
about income distribution.

00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.527
What this has done is allowed
the average two-family

00:44:25.527 --> 00:44:27.022
household to tread water.

00:44:27.022 --> 00:44:28.730
So it's, the average
two-family household

00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:31.440
today has the same income
as they did in the 1970s.

00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:31.940
Why?

00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:34.965
Because workers earn a ton less
in real terms than they did,

00:44:34.965 --> 00:44:36.590
and that's facts
about inequality we'll

00:44:36.590 --> 00:44:38.450
come to, that basically,
the average family

00:44:38.450 --> 00:44:40.165
in America, despite having--

00:44:40.165 --> 00:44:42.290
going from the wife not
working to the wife working

00:44:42.290 --> 00:44:44.570
is no better off they
were 40 years ago.

00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:47.990
And that has lots implications
we'll talk about, OK?

00:44:47.990 --> 00:44:50.880
So any other
questions about that?

00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:55.640
So let me end with one final
example, an application, OK?

00:44:55.640 --> 00:45:01.868
Which is to the problem we have
in the world of child labor.

00:45:01.868 --> 00:45:03.410
It's a huge problem
around the world,

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.180
is kids being forced to work.

00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:07.430
It was a huge problem in the
US till the 20th century.

00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:08.972
It's a huge problem
around the world,

00:45:08.972 --> 00:45:11.180
because A, work can often
be dangerous and bad

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.120
for their health, but B,
they can't be going to school

00:45:14.120 --> 00:45:16.010
and having the opportunity
better themselves.

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:18.170
If a kid is spending
all day working,

00:45:18.170 --> 00:45:19.670
then that kid is
destined to a life

00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:21.920
of working in the
same crappy job,

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:24.110
because there's no way to
get the skills that allows

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:27.220
them to grow and go further.

00:45:27.220 --> 00:45:31.630
Now, one-- we will talk in the
next few lectures-- in a few

00:45:31.630 --> 00:45:34.450
lectures about
international trade.

00:45:34.450 --> 00:45:36.820
And one criticism of
international trade

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.490
is people say, "Well, if
you allow these developing

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:43.000
countries to sell more stuff
to the developed world,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.520
that will-- they'll put
the kids to work more."

00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:48.415
So if we have free trade and
Vietnam can suddenly sell

00:45:48.415 --> 00:45:51.040
a bunch stuff to America, that's
more kids they;re going to put

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.750
to work making that stuff.

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:55.750
So one common argument you
hear against free trade

00:45:55.750 --> 00:46:00.700
is it's bad for kids, but in
fact, that argument is not

00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:04.800
necessarily right, because it
ignores an important point.

00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:05.550
Manny?

00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:10.680
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.600
JONATHAN GRUBER: No,
that's a different issue.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:15.360
The point-- that's right,
but the point it ignores

00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:17.435
is free trade makes
families richer.

00:46:17.435 --> 00:46:18.810
And the families
are richer, they

00:46:18.810 --> 00:46:22.320
may want to buy more
education for their kids.

00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.730
So on the one hand, it's true.

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.942
Free trade makes kids more
valuable in the labor force.

00:46:26.942 --> 00:46:28.650
On the other hand, it
makes family richer

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:30.700
and they want more
education for their kids.

00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:32.492
So to look at that two
Dartmouth professors

00:46:32.492 --> 00:46:34.303
did a study, who
looked at Vietnam,

00:46:34.303 --> 00:46:36.720
and looked at what happened
when Vietnam liberalized trade

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.870
in rice.

00:46:37.870 --> 00:46:40.192
So let's go to figure 15-6.

00:46:40.192 --> 00:46:42.150
Now, we haven't gotten
international trade yet,

00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:44.310
so I'm just going to sort
of hand wave through this.

00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:45.570
You don't need to really
understand this graph,

00:46:45.570 --> 00:46:47.150
except what the bottom line is.

00:46:47.150 --> 00:46:52.040
OK, what happened was
before trade liberalization

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:55.610
of Vietnam, before
1989, you could only

00:46:55.610 --> 00:46:58.840
sell rice made in
Vietnam in Vietnam.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:00.570
So what that meant
was the supply of rice

00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:04.320
was s sub v. The demand
for rice was d sub v,

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.810
and the amount of rice
sold was q sub v. And kids

00:47:06.810 --> 00:47:08.930
worked in the rice paddies.

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:11.870
When they liberalized
trade, suddenly Vietnam

00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:14.090
could sell to a
much larger market.

00:47:14.090 --> 00:47:18.030
They could sell to the
world market, d sub w.

00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:19.830
That's a bigger market.

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:23.010
So they were able to shift
up their supply curve

00:47:23.010 --> 00:47:24.210
and sell more rice.

00:47:26.693 --> 00:47:28.610
They could sell more
rice, because now they're

00:47:28.610 --> 00:47:31.110
selling to the whole
world, not just to Vietnam.

00:47:31.110 --> 00:47:33.050
You don't need to notice this
in the graph so much intuition.

00:47:33.050 --> 00:47:34.550
If you give someone
a bigger market,

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.350
they're going to
make more stuff, OK?

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:36.990
Yeah.

00:47:36.990 --> 00:47:39.282
AUDIENCE: But doesn't that
also put them in competition

00:47:39.282 --> 00:47:41.357
in other countries, whereas
if it was just like--

00:47:41.357 --> 00:47:43.190
if each country is just
selling to themself,

00:47:43.190 --> 00:47:45.127
then Vietnam would have--

00:47:45.127 --> 00:47:47.210
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, they
liberalized in the sense

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:48.820
that they let it send out.

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.196
I didn't say they let more in.

00:47:50.196 --> 00:47:50.970
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:51.710
JONATHAN GRUBER: OK,
but we'll come back

00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:53.480
to international trade, OK?

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:55.760
So basically, the
point is, there

00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.130
was this demand shock that
allowed them to sell more rice.

00:47:59.130 --> 00:48:01.938
So what effect does that have
on the market for child labor?

00:48:01.938 --> 00:48:03.855
Let's go to the highly
complicated last figure

00:48:03.855 --> 00:48:06.140
and let me walk
you through this.

00:48:06.140 --> 00:48:09.980
Here is the market
for child labor, OK?

00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:12.980
On the x-axis is the
amount of child labor.

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:16.430
On the y-axis the
wage of kids, OK?

00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:21.430
We start at point one, initial
demand and initial supply,

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:23.210
wage 1, L1.

00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:26.840
Now we liberalize
trade, and that

00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:29.480
leads to more demand
for child labor,

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:32.500
because we want to
produce more rice.

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:36.210
So that shifts us out
to D2 and point two.

00:48:36.210 --> 00:48:37.680
So we have more child labor.

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.840
That's bad.

00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:44.400
But what this ignores is
families are now richer,

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:48.750
and with the income effect, they
will buy their kids education.

00:48:48.750 --> 00:48:52.520
They'll pull their kids out of
working and put them in school.

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:57.580
That's represented as a shift
to the left of the supply curve.

00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.660
So we move from point
two to point three

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.390
through the income effect.

00:49:01.390 --> 00:49:02.620
Families are now richer.

00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:05.600
And indeed, if the income
effect is large enough,

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:07.920
you could move to point four.

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:11.360
You could actually have a
reduction in child labor.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.260
Why?

00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.420
Because the benefits
of more kids working

00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:16.310
in terms of producing
more rice is

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.982
exceeded by the value
of the firms of taking--

00:49:18.982 --> 00:49:20.690
of the families of
taking the extra money

00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:24.930
they're making and putting it
into education for their kids.

00:49:24.930 --> 00:49:28.560
And in fact, the studies showed
that we did move to a point

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:31.230
like point four, OK?

00:49:31.230 --> 00:49:33.870
We actually found
that child labor

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:37.280
fell when they
liberalized trade,

00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.220
that the intuitive
argument, that gee, if they

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.950
sell more, more kids are
going to work, it's wrong.

00:49:42.950 --> 00:49:46.230
That in fact, when you sell
more, yes, more kids-- demand

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:48.530
for more kids, but
families are so rich,

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.410
they put their kids in education
rather than their fields, OK?

00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:55.230
And that is a wonderful sort
of counterintuitive story

00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:56.310
of how what--

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.292
I'll talk about economies
like free trade, how

00:49:58.292 --> 00:50:00.750
free trade can actually have
an unexpected positive effect.

00:50:00.750 --> 00:50:01.940
We might think it's negative.

00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:02.670
And there's a question.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:04.920
Come up if you want to talk,
but we've got to end now.

00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:06.720
So thank you for
saying a minute extra,

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:11.240
and I will see you
guys on Wednesday.

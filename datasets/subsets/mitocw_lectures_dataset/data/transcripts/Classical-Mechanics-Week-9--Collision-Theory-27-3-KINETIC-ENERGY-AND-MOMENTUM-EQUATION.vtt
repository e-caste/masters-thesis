WEBVTT

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.180
So we're going to return to
our one-dimensional elastic

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.070
collision with no
external forces.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:14.520
So we have object 1 moving with
velocity V1 initial and object

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.620
2 maybe it's moving this
way with V2 initial i hat,

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.990
again, on a
frictionless surface.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.280
And we'll call that
our initial state.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.980
And here you can imagine we're
going to use a ground reference

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:29.580
frame.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.350
So both objects are moving.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.060
And our final state
has object 1-- well,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.340
we don't know, again,
which way it's going.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.970
We can just say it bounced back.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.036
And object 2 also bounced back.

00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:46.660
But the goal of our
problem, of course,

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.800
is to determine these vectors.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.500
And by knowing the vectors,
we know which way they go.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.290
Now because energy and
momentum are constant,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.885
let's write down
our two equations.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.260
And I'm going to
write them down,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.240
again, in terms of components.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:10.030
So we have 1/2 m1 V1x
initial squared plus 1/2

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:20.940
m2 V2x initial squared equals
1/2 m1 V1x final squared

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.520
plus 1/2 m2 V2x final squared.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.504
Now we're going to do some
algebraic manipulations here.

00:01:30.504 --> 00:01:31.920
So the first thing
I'm going to do

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.280
is just eliminate these halves
because it's not necessary.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.880
And I don't want to
rewrite this equation.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.789
And this is our fact that
our energy is constant.

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.495
And now our condition
that momentum is constant,

00:01:46.495 --> 00:01:48.870
we'll write this-- now, I'm
going to leave a little space

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.300
here intentionally.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.110
And our condition that
momentum is constant

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:03.840
is m1 Vx initial plus m2
V2x initial equals m1 V1x

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.030
final plus m2 V2x final.

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.050
Now this energy equation
can be factored in

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.310
by bringing all the m1 terms
to one side and the M2 terms

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.850
to the other side.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.060
So when I write that,
I'll need a little room.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:28.680
I have m1 V1x initial squared
minus V1x final squared.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.420
And that's equal to
m2 V2x final squared

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.177
minus V2x initial squared.

00:02:37.177 --> 00:02:39.510
So I've just brought those
terms over to the other side.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.550
Now likewise I'll do the
same thing down here.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:53.070
I have m1 V1x initial
minus V1x final.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:03:00.630
And that's equal to m2 V2x
final minus V2x initial.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.370
Now here comes the
algebraic trick

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.180
in which I'm going to
linearize these systems.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.950
This is a squared
minus b squared,

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.270
which factors into a
plus b times a minus b.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.070
So let's give ourselves
a little room.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.220
m1 V1x initial plus-- let's
put the minus sign first.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:32.500
minus V1x final times V1x
initial plus V1x final.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.040
Factored that term.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.500
We have the same factoring
on the other side.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.400
So it's just
identical, V2x final

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:49.680
minus V2x initial times
V2x final plus V2x initial.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.870
Now let's call this equation
1a and our momentum factored

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.250
as 2a.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.190
Now if you notice,
the momentum piece

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.850
is appearing exactly
there and exactly here.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.500
So when I divide 1a
by 2a-- and I'll just

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.960
symbolically represent that--
then these two pieces cancel.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.420
And that leads to just this
term equal to that term.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.370
And the significance, as
you'll see when I write it out,

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:33.360
1 of x 1x final equals V2x
final plus V2x initial.

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.190
I've solved the quad-- I've
eliminated the squared terms,

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.240
linearized the system.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.440
Now I still want to write
this equation in another way.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.420
Another important
point to notice

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.290
is that this equation
is independent of mass.

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.150
Now what I want to
do is write this

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.400
in terms of those concepts
of relative velocity we had.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.220
Remember just to motivate
this, V relative by definition

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.980
was V1 minus V2.

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:09.030
So let's write this in terms
of the initial and the final.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.120
So in order to do that, we
have to bring this initial term

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.210
over to here and this
final term over to there.

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:20.520
And so this equation, which
will give it a number 3,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.760
and now we'll modify
that by calling it 3a.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.730
We have V1x initial
minus V2x initial.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.270
Now notice the sign.

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.770
I'm going to want to keep
the order of 1 and 2.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:42.690
So I have to put a minus sign,
V1x final minus V2x final.

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:51.280
And when written this way,
this is the initial component

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.290
of the relative velocity.

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:56.620
And in there is the final
component of relative velocity.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.420
So by combining
these two equations,

00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.830
I have this remarkable result
that V relative initial

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:06.025
is minus V relative final.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.390
And this condition is
a very powerful tool

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.740
for simply analyzing
one-dimensional elastic and

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.934
inelastic collisions.

00:06:18.934 --> 00:06:20.350
I'd like to even
give this a name.

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:30.890
I'd like to call it the
energy momentum equation.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.140
Now there's a lot of
significant things about this.

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:35.390
So let's just think
about it for a moment.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:40.100
We have that V relative
initial in magnitude

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.060
is equal to V relative final.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.800
And so right away, this
gives us some insight

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.850
into any collision.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.850
We can see whether
a collision, if we

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:51.800
know what the relative
initial velocity is,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:56.240
we know that the final relative
velocity has the same magnitude

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.940
but simply switches direction.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.030
And that's a powerful tool in
which to analyze collisions

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.870
without doing a lot of algebra.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.350
PROFESSOR: Over the last
series of lectures, in

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.940
discussing filtering,
modulation, and sampling,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.720
we've seen how powerful
and useful the

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.490
Fourier transform is.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.210
Beginning with this lecture,
and over the next several

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.400
lectures, I'd like to develop
and exploit a generalization

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.600
of the Fourier transform, which
will not only lead to

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.240
some important new insights
about signals and systems, but

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.110
also will remove some of the
restrictions that we've had

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.300
with the Fourier transform.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.510
The generalization that we'll
be talking about in the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.330
continuous time case is referred
to as the Laplace

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.060
transform, and in the discrete
time case, is referred to as

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.680
the z transform.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.810
What I'd like to do in today's
lecture is begin on the

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.110
continuous time case,
namely a discussion

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.010
of the Laplace transform.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:55.130
Continue that into the next
lecture, and following that

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.690
develop the z transform
for discrete time.

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.150
And also, as we go
along, exploit

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.080
the two notions together.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.630
Now, to introduce the notion of
the Laplace transform, let

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.250
me remind you again
of what led us

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.380
into the Fourier transform.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.910
We developed the Fourier
transform by considering the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.210
idea of representing signals
as linear combinations of

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.660
basic signals.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:33.060
And in the Fourier transform,
in the continuous time case,

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.190
the basic signals that we picked
in the representation

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.800
were complex exponentials.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.650
And in what we had referred to
as the synthesis equation, the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.020
synthesis equation corresponded
to, in effect, a

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.230
decomposition as a linear
combination, a decomposition

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.350
of x of t as a linear
combination of complex

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.980
exponentials.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.440
And of course, associated with
this was the corresponding

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.010
analysis equation that, in
effect, gave us the amplitudes

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.850
associated with the complex
exponentials.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.550
Now, why did we pick complex
exponentials?

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.760
Well, recall that the reason was
that complex exponentials

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.250
are eigenfunctions of linear
time-invariant systems, and

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.900
that was very convenient.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.900
Specifically, if we have a
linear time-invariant system

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.080
with an impulse response h of
t, what we had shown is that

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.750
that class of systems has the
property that if we put in a

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.070
complex exponential, we get out
a complex exponential at

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.100
the same frequency and with
a change in amplitude.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.790
And this change in amplitude,
in fact, corresponded as we

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.180
showed as the discussion went
along, to the Fourier

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.380
transform of the system
impulse response.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:06.630
So the notion of decomposing
signals into complex

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.710
exponentials was very intimately
connected, and the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.470
Fourier transform was very
intimately connected, with the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.810
eigenfunction property of
complex exponentials for

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.070
linear time-invariant systems.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:24.370
Well, complex exponentials of
that type are not the only

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.470
eigenfunctions for linear
time-invariant systems.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.210
In fact, what you've seen
previously is that if we took

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.290
a more general exponential, e
to the st, where s is a more

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.760
general complex number.

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.670
Not just j omega, but in fact
sigma plus j omega.

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.110
For any value of s, the complex
exponential is an

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.370
eigenfunction.

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.350
And we can justify that simply
by substitution into the

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.040
convolution integral.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.060
In other words, the response to
this complex exponential is

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.570
the convolution of the impulse
response with the excitation.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:12.070
And notice that we can break
this term into a product, e to

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.030
the st e to the minus s tau.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:21.300
And the e to the st term can
come outside the integration.

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.160
And consequently, just carrying
through that algebra,

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:32.760
would reduce this integral to
an integral with an e to the

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.040
st factor outside.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.130
So just simply carrying through
the algebra, what we

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.360
would conclude is that a complex
exponential with any

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.110
complex number s would generate,
as an output, a

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:51.960
complex exponential of the
same form multiplied by

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.460
whatever this integral is.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.520
And this integral, of course,
will depend on what

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.110
the value of s is.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.030
But that's all that
it will depend on.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:06.340
Or said another way, what this
all can be denoted as is some

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.560
function h of s that depends
on the value of s.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.370
So finally then, e to the st as
an excitation to a linear

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.430
time-invariant system generates
a response, which is

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:26.840
a complex constant depending
on s, multiplying the same

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.340
function that excited
the system.

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:35.840
So what we have then is the
eigenfunction property, more

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:41.300
generally, in terms of a more
general complex exponential

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.660
where the complex factor is
given by this integral.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.830
Well, in fact, what that
integral corresponds to is

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.120
what we will define as the
Laplace transform of the

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.860
impulse response.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.710
And in fact, we can apply this
transformation to a more

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.240
general time function that may
or may not be the impulse

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:12.370
response of a linear
time-invariant system.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:17.130
And so, in general, it is this
transformation on a time

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:22.020
function which is the Laplace
transform of that time

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:25.050
function, and it's
a function of s.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:31.120
So the definition of the Laplace
transform is that the

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:37.120
Laplace transform of a time
function x of t is the result

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.990
of this transformation
on x of t.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:45.280
It's denoted as x of s, and as a
shorthand notation as we had

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:49.040
with the Fourier transform,
then we have in the time

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.640
domain, the time function x
of t, and in the Laplace

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.170
transform domain, the
function x of s.

00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.560
And these then represent
a transform pair.

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:07.190
Now, let me remind you that
the development of that

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:11.170
mapping is exactly the process
the we went through initially

00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:14.670
in developing a mapping
that ended up giving

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:17.260
us the Fourier transform.

00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.710
Essentially, what we've done is
just broadened our horizon

00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:24.140
somewhat, or our notation
somewhat.

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.750
And rather than pushing just a
complex exponential through

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:31.830
the system, we've pushed a more
general time function e

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:35.760
to the st, where s is a complex
number with both a

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.080
real part and an
imaginary part.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.440
Well, the discussion that we've
gone through so far, of

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.440
course, is very closely related
to what we went

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.020
through for the Fourier
transform.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:49.860
The mapping that we've
ended up with is

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.850
called the Laplace transform.

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:54.490
And as you can well imagine
and perhaps, may have

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:59.200
recognized already, there's a
very close connection between

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.500
the Laplace transform and
the Fourier transform.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.440
Well, to see one of the
connections, what we can

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:11.240
observe is that if we look
at the Fourier transform

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:16.020
expression and if we look
at the Laplace transform

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:21.720
expression, where s is now a
general complex number sigma

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:25.720
plus j omega, these two
expressions, in fact, are

00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:31.730
identical if, in fact,
sigma is equal to 0.

00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:36.530
If sigma is equal to 0 so that
s is just j omega, then all

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:40.550
that this transformation is,
is the same as that.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.490
Substitute in s equals j omega
and this is what we get.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:51.190
What this then tells us is that
if we have the Laplace

00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:57.390
transform, and if we look at
the Laplace transform at s

00:09:57.390 --> 00:10:05.350
equals j omega, then that, in
fact, corresponds to the

00:10:05.350 --> 00:10:09.420
Fourier transform of x of t.

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:13.910
Now, there is a slight
notational issue that this

00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:15.650
raises, and it's very

00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:17.530
straightforward to clean it up.

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:19.520
But it's something that it's--

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:23.980
you have to just kind of focus
on for a second to understand

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:25.470
what the issue is.

00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:30.510
Notice that on the left-hand
side of this equation, x of s

00:10:30.510 --> 00:10:33.550
representing the Laplace
transform.

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:36.690
When we look at that with sigma
equal to 0 or s equal to

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:41.100
j omega, our natural inclination
is to write that

00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.140
as x of j omega, of course.

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:46.470
On the other hand, the
right-hand side of the

00:10:46.470 --> 00:10:49.970
equation, namely the Fourier
transform of x of t, we've

00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:55.500
typically written
as x of omega.

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.210
Focusing on the fact that
it's a function of

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:00.580
this variable omega.

00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.250
Well, there's a slight
awkwardness here because here

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:05.740
we're talking about an argument
j omega, here we're

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.920
talking about an
argument omega.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.370
And a very straightforward way
of dealing with that is to

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:16.760
simply change our notation for
the Fourier transform,

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.850
recognizing that the Fourier
transform, of course, is a

00:11:19.850 --> 00:11:22.740
function of omega, but
it's also, in fact, a

00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.470
function of j omega.

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:28.060
And if we write it that
way, then the two

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.440
notations come together.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.520
In other words, the Laplace
transform at s equals j omega

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.260
just simply reduces both
mathematically and

00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:39.100
notationally to the
Fourier transform.

00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:43.400
So the notation that we'll now
be adopting for the Fourier

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.110
transform is the notation
whereby we express the Fourier

00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:53.190
transform no longer simply as
x of omega, but choosing as

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.760
the argument j omega.

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.620
Simple notational change.

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:02.360
Now, here we see one
relationship between the

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:06.560
Fourier transform and the
Laplace transform.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:10.180
Namely that the Laplace
transform for s equals j omega

00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.770
reduces to the Fourier
transform.

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:17.340
We also have another important
relationship.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:22.880
In particular, the fact that the
Laplace transform can be

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:28.160
interpreted as the Fourier
transform of a modified

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.710
version of x of t.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:32.820
Let me show you what I mean.

00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.000
Here, of course, we have
the relationship

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.190
that we just developed.

00:12:36.190 --> 00:12:38.225
Namely that s equals j omega.

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:42.540
The Laplace transform reduces
to the Fourier transform.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:45.810
But now let's look at the more
general Laplace transform

00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.440
expression.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.800
And if we substitute in s equals
sigma plus j omega,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.500
which is the general form for
this complex variable s, and

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:04.820
we carry through some of the
algebra, breaking this into

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.840
the product of two exponentials,
z to the minus

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.360
sigma t times z to the
minus j omega t.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.530
We now have this expression
where, of course, in both of

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:20.140
these there is a dt.

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:26.380
And now when we look at this,
what we observe is that this,

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:30.930
in fact, is the Fourier
transform of something.

00:13:30.930 --> 00:13:32.160
What's the something?

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:35.830
It's not x of t anymore, it's
the Fourier transform of x of

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:40.730
t multiplied by e to
the minus sigma t.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:44.790
So if we think of these two
terms together, this integral

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:46.930
is just the Fourier transform.

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:51.070
It's the Fourier transform of
x of t multiplied by an

00:13:51.070 --> 00:13:52.170
exponential.

00:13:52.170 --> 00:13:57.600
If sigma is greater than 0,
it's an exponential that

00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.720
decays with time.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.540
If sigma is less than 0,
it's an exponential

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.380
that grows with time.

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.720
So we have then this additional
relationship, which

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:13.010
tells us that the Laplace
transform is the Fourier

00:14:13.010 --> 00:14:19.630
transform of an exponentially
weighted time function.

00:14:19.630 --> 00:14:24.290
Now, this exponential weighting
has some important

00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:26.000
significance.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.800
In particular, recall that
there were issues of

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.840
convergence with the
Fourier transform.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.590
In particular, the
Fourier transform

00:14:35.590 --> 00:14:36.940
may or may not converge.

00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:40.700
And for convergence, in fact,
what's required is that the

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.250
time function that we're
transforming be absolutely

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.140
integrable.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:49.920
Now, we can have a time function
that isn't absolutely

00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.930
integrable because, let's
say, it grows

00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.760
exponentially as time increases.

00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.940
But when we multiply it by this
exponential factor that's

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:05.050
embodied in the Laplace
transform, in fact that brings

00:15:05.050 --> 00:15:07.970
the function back down
for positive time.

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:13.430
And we'll impose absolute
integrability on the product

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:17.190
of x of t times e to
the minus sigma t.

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:22.300
And so the conclusion, an
important point is that the

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.610
Laplace transform, the Fourier
transform of this product may

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.490
converge, even though
the Fourier

00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:29.530
transform of x of t doesn't.

00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.460
In other words, the Laplace
transform may converge even

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:35.970
when the Fourier transform
doesn't converge.

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:38.030
And we'll see that and we'll
see examples of it as the

00:15:38.030 --> 00:15:40.830
discussion goes along.

00:15:40.830 --> 00:15:43.500
Now let me also draw your
attention to the fact,

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:48.720
although we won't be working
through this in detail.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.520
To the fact that this equation,
in effect, provides

00:15:53.520 --> 00:16:00.990
the basis for us to figure out
how to express x of t in terms

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.100
of the Laplace transform.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.350
In effect, we can apply the
inverse Fourier transform to

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:10.870
this, thereby to this, account
for the exponential factor by

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.980
bringing it over to
the other side.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:17.260
And if you go through this, and
in fact, you'll have an

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.860
opportunity to go through this
both in the video course

00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:26.180
manual and also it's carried
through in the text, what you

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:30.600
end up with is a synthesis
equation, an expression for x

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.070
of t in terms of x of
s which corresponds

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.730
to a synthesis equation.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:40.070
And which now builds x of t out
of a linear combination of

00:16:40.070 --> 00:16:44.570
not necessarily functions of the
form e to the j omega t,

00:16:44.570 --> 00:16:50.930
but in terms of functions or
basic signals which are more

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:56.160
general exponentials
e to the st.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:01.720
OK, well, let's just look at
some examples of the Laplace

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:03.320
transform of some
time functions.

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.980
And these examples that I'll
go through are all examples

00:17:07.980 --> 00:17:10.410
that are worked out
in the text.

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.790
And so I don't want to
focus on the algebra.

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.990
What I'd like to focus on are
some of the issues and the

00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:18.450
interpretation.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:24.010
Let's first of all, look at the
example in the text, which

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:26.329
is Example 9.1.

00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:31.720
If we take the Fourier transform
of this exponential,

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.745
then, as you well know, the
result we have is 1 over j

00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:37.500
omega plus a.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:41.010
And that can't converge
for any a.

00:17:41.010 --> 00:17:44.680
In particular, it's only
for a greater than 0.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:48.090
What that really means is that
for convergence of the Fourier

00:17:48.090 --> 00:17:52.840
transform, this has to be
a decaying exponential.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.620
It can't be an increasing
exponential.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:01.620
If instead we apply the Laplace
transform to this,

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:06.030
applying the Laplace transform
is the same as taking the

00:18:06.030 --> 00:18:11.430
Fourier transform of x of t
times an exponential, and the

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.160
exponent that we would
multiply by is e to

00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:15.710
the minus sigma t.

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:21.100
So in effect, taking the Laplace
transform of this is

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:26.032
like taking the Fourier
transform of e to the minus at

00:18:26.032 --> 00:18:29.860
e to the minus sigma t.

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:34.490
And if we carry that through,
just working through the

00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:38.750
integral, we end up with a
Laplace transform, which is 1

00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:42.200
over s plus a.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:47.710
But just as in the Fourier
transform, the Fourier

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:50.980
transform won't converge
for any a.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:56.110
Now what happens is that the
Laplace transform will only

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:00.530
converge when the Fourier
transform of this converges.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:04.430
Said another way, it's when
the combination of a plus

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.490
sigma is greater than 0.

00:19:07.490 --> 00:19:11.860
So we would require that, if I
write it over here, a plus

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.000
sigma is greater than 0.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:19.510
Or that sigma is greater
than minus a.

00:19:19.510 --> 00:19:24.460
So in fact, in the Laplace
transform of this, we have an

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.880
expression 1 over s plus a.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:32.260
But we also require, in
interpreting that, that the

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:37.430
real part of s be greater
than minus a.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:42.120
So that, essentially, the
Fourier transform of x of t

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.300
times e to the minus
sigma t converges.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:49.960
So it's important to recognize
that the algebraic expression

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:55.040
that we get is only valid for
certain values of the

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.580
real part of s.

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.180
And so, for this example, we
can summarize it as this

00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.110
exponential has a Laplace
transform, which is 1 over s

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:09.560
plus a, where s is restricted to
the range the real part of

00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:11.430
s greater than minus a.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:18.900
Now, we haven't had this issue
before of restrictions on what

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.210
the value of s is.

00:20:20.210 --> 00:20:22.600
With the Fourier transform,
either it converged or it

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:23.880
didn't converge.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.760
With the Laplace transform,
there are certain values of s.

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.620
We now have more flexibility,
and so there's certain values

00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.690
of the real part of s for which
it converges and certain

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:36.360
values for which it doesn't.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.110
The values of s for
which the Laplace

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.880
transform converges is--

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:47.570
the values are referred to as
the region of convergence of

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:50.580
the Laplace transform.

00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:56.130
And it's important to recognize
that in specifying

00:20:56.130 --> 00:20:59.370
the Laplace transform, what's
required is not only the

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:05.370
algebraic expression, but also
the domain or set of values of

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:12.210
s for which that algebraic
expression is valid.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:16.670
Just to underscore that point,
let me draw your attention to

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:21.890
another example in the text,
which is Example 9.2.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:27.445
In Example 9.2, we have an
exponential for negative time,

00:21:27.445 --> 00:21:30.040
0 for positive time.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.380
And if you carry through the
algebra there, you end up with

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.950
a Laplace transform expression,
which is again 1

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.660
over s plus a.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.280
Exactly the same algebraic
expression as we had for the

00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.490
previous example.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:49.660
The important distinction is
that now the real part of s is

00:21:49.660 --> 00:21:52.170
restricted to be less
than minus a.

00:21:52.170 --> 00:21:56.750
And so, in fact, if you compare
this example with the

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:00.180
one above it, and let's just
look back at the answer that

00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.350
we had there.

00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:07.240
If you compare those two
examples, here the algebraic

00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.820
expression is 1 over s plus
a with a certain region of

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.130
convergence.

00:22:13.130 --> 00:22:18.260
Here the algebraic expression
is 1 over s plus a.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.260
And the only difference between
those two is the

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.180
domain or region
of convergence.

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:27.840
So there is another
complication, or twist, now.

00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.040
Not only do we need to generate
the algebraic

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:37.200
expression, but we also have to
be careful to specify the

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:41.500
region of convergence over
which that algebraic

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.280
expression is valid.

00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.450
Now, later on in this lecture,
and actually also as the

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:52.830
discussion of the Laplace
transform goes on, we'll begin

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.350
to see and understand more
about how the region of

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.360
convergence relates to various

00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:03.420
properties of the time function.

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:07.070
Well, let's finally look at one
additional example from

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.550
the text, And this
is Example 9.3.

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:15.420
And what it consists of is the
time function, which is the

00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:18.620
sum of two exponentials.

00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.190
And although we haven't
formally talked about

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.920
properties of the Laplace
transform yet, one of the

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.210
properties that we'll
see-- and it's

00:23:26.210 --> 00:23:28.050
relatively easy to develop--

00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:32.260
is the fact that the Laplace
transform of a sum is the sum

00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:33.430
of the Laplace transform.

00:23:33.430 --> 00:23:38.330
So, in fact, we can get the
Laplace transform of the sum

00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:44.910
of these two terms as the sum
of the Laplace transforms.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:49.390
So for this one, we know from
the example that we looked at

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.810
previously, Example 9.1, that
this is of the form 1 over s

00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:57.940
plus 1 with a region of
convergence, which is the real

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.180
part of s greater
than minus 1.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:04.030
For this one, we have a Laplace
transform which is 1

00:24:04.030 --> 00:24:08.810
over s plus 2 with a region of
convergence which is the real

00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:12.270
part of s greater
than minus 2.

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:16.010
So for the two of them together,
we have to take the

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:18.140
overlap of those two regions.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:21.540
In other words, we have to
take the region that

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:24.810
encompasses both the real part
of s greater than minus 1 and

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.230
the real part of s greater
than minus 2.

00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:31.870
And if we put those together,
then we have a combined region

00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:34.140
of convergence, which is
the real part of s

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.610
greater than minus 1.

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:39.140
So this is the expression.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:44.270
And for this particular example,
what we have is a

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:46.450
ratio of polynomials.

00:24:46.450 --> 00:24:49.830
The ratio of polynomials,
there's a numerator polynomial

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:52.080
and a denominator polynomial.

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:59.020
And it's convenient to summarize
these by plotting

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:02.180
the roots of the numerator
polynomial and the roots of

00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:06.110
the denominator polynomial
in the complex plane.

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.650
And the complex plane which
they're plotted is referred to

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:13.350
the s-plane.

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:18.590
So we can, for example, take the
denominator polynomial and

00:25:18.590 --> 00:25:24.230
summarize it by specifying the
fact, or by representing the

00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:28.710
fact that it has roots at s
equals minus 1 and at s

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.190
equals minus 2.

00:25:30.190 --> 00:25:33.950
And I've done that in this
picture by putting an x where

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:37.850
the roots of the denominator
polynomial are.

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:42.720
The numerator polynomial has a
root at s equals minus 3/2,

00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:45.070
and I've represented
that by a circle.

00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:48.510
So these are the roots of the
denominator polynomial and

00:25:48.510 --> 00:25:50.070
this is the root of
the numerator

00:25:50.070 --> 00:25:52.220
polynomial for this example.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:56.540
And also, for this example, we
can represent the region of

00:25:56.540 --> 00:26:00.300
convergence, which is
the real part of s

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.600
greater than minus 1.

00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.720
And so that's, in fact,
the region over here.

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:09.850
There is also, if I draw these,
just the roots of the

00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.180
numerator and denominator of
polynomials, I would need an

00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:16.820
additional piece of information
to specify the

00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:18.460
algebraic expression
completely.

00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:21.250
Namely, a multiplying constant
out in front

00:26:21.250 --> 00:26:24.190
of the whole thing.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:31.220
Well, this particular example,
has the Laplace transform as a

00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:32.600
rational function.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.950
Namely, it's one polynomial in
the numerator and another

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:38.040
polynomial in the denominator.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:41.610
And in fact, as we'll see,
Laplace transforms, which are

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:45.170
ratios of polynomials, form
a very important class.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:48.430
They, in fact, represent systems
that are describable

00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:51.810
by linear constant coefficient
differential equations.

00:26:51.810 --> 00:26:53.510
You shouldn't necessarily--

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.420
in fact, for sure you
shouldn't see

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.850
why that's true now.

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.050
We'll see that later.

00:26:59.050 --> 00:27:06.060
But that means that Laplace
transforms that are rational

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:10.280
functions, namely, the ratio
of a numerator polynomial

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.180
divided by the denominator
polynomial, become very

00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:18.640
important in the discussion
that follows.

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:22.760
And in fact, we have some
terminology for this.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:27.030
The roots of the numerator
polynomial are referred to as

00:27:27.030 --> 00:27:30.750
the zeroes of the Laplace
transform.

00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:34.165
Because, of course, those are
the values of s at which x of

00:27:34.165 --> 00:27:36.790
s becomes 0.

00:27:36.790 --> 00:27:40.130
And the roots of the denominator
polynomial are

00:27:40.130 --> 00:27:44.900
referred to as the poles of
the Laplace transform.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.840
And those are the values of
s at which the Laplace

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.090
transform blows up.

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:53.600
Namely, becomes infinite.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:57.430
If you think of setting s equal
to a value where this

00:27:57.430 --> 00:28:00.780
denominator polynomial goes
to 0, of course, x

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:02.880
of s becomes infinite.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:06.860
And what we would expect and,
of course, we'll see

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.360
that this is true.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:12.670
What we would expect is that
wherever that happens, there

00:28:12.670 --> 00:28:14.750
must be some problem
with convergence

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.930
of the Laplace transform.

00:28:15.930 --> 00:28:18.160
And indeed, the Laplace
transform doesn't

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.960
converge at the poles.

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.390
Namely, at the roots of the
denominator polynomial.

00:28:24.390 --> 00:28:28.120
So, in fact, let's focus in
on that a little further.

00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:33.980
Let's examine and talk about the
region of convergence of

00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:38.200
the Laplace transform, and how
it's associated both with

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.970
properties of the time function,
and also with the

00:28:41.970 --> 00:28:46.720
location of the poles of
the Laplace transform.

00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:50.320
And as we'll see, there are
some very specific and

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.500
important relationships and
conclusions that we can draw

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:58.790
about how the region of
convergence is constrained and

00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:05.790
associated with the locations
of the poles in the s-plane.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:11.310
Well, to begin with, we can, of
course, make the statement

00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.350
as I've just made that
the region of

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.260
convergence contains no poles.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:22.600
In particular, if I think
of this general rational

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:29.310
function, the poles of x of s
are the values of s at which

00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:30.870
the denominator is 0.

00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:34.560
Or equivalently, x
of s blows up.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.160
And of course then, that implies
that the expression

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:41.460
has no longer converged.

00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.370
Well, that's one statement
that we can make.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:46.160
Now, there are some others.

00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:51.170
And one, for example, is the
statement that if I have a

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:55.820
point in the s-plane that
corresponds to convergence,

00:29:55.820 --> 00:30:00.680
then in fact any line in the
s-plane with that same real

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.100
part will also be a set of
values for which the Laplace

00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:07.110
transform converges.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:09.450
And what's the reason
for that?

00:30:09.450 --> 00:30:15.910
The reason for that is that s
is sigma plus j omega and

00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:20.840
convergence of the Laplace
transform is associated with

00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:25.580
convergence of the Fourier
transform of e to the minus

00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.390
sigma t times x of t.

00:30:28.390 --> 00:30:31.950
And so the convergence only
depends on sigma.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:37.010
If it only depends on sigma,
then if it converges for one

00:30:37.010 --> 00:30:39.200
value of sigma--

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.980
I'm sorry, for a value of sigma
for some value of omega,

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.840
then it will converge for
that same sigma for

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.130
any value of omega.

00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:55.650
The conclusion then is that the
region of convergence, if

00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:58.110
I have a point, then
I also have a line.

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.080
And so what that suggests is
that as we look at the region

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.930
of convergence, it in fact
corresponds to strips in the

00:31:05.930 --> 00:31:09.360
complex plane.

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:12.930
Now, finally we can tie
together the region of

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:17.980
convergence to the convergence
of the Fourier transform.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:23.220
In particular, since we know
that the Laplace transform

00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:28.480
reduces to the Fourier transform
when the complex

00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:34.770
variable s is equal to j omega,
the implication is that

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:40.000
if we have the Laplace transform
and if the Laplace

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.300
transform reduces to the
Fourier transform when

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.440
sigma equals 0.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:48.140
In other words, when s is equal
to j omega, then the

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:52.600
Fourier transform of x of t
converging is equivalent to

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:57.530
the statement that the Laplace
transform converges for sigma

00:31:57.530 --> 00:31:58.930
equal to 0.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:00.310
In other words, that
the region of

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:04.340
convergence includes what?

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.690
The j omega axis
in the s-plane.

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.230
So we have then some statements
that kind of tie

00:32:14.230 --> 00:32:17.680
together the location of the
poles and the region of

00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.270
convergence.

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:21.340
Let me make one other statement,
which is a much

00:32:21.340 --> 00:32:22.800
harder statement to justify.

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:25.240
And I won't try to, I'll
just simply state it.

00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.810
And that is that the region of
convergence of the Laplace

00:32:27.810 --> 00:32:31.320
transform is a connected
region.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:37.330
In other words, if the entire
region consists of a single

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:42.480
strip in the s-plane, it can't
consist of a strip over here,

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.650
for example, and a
strip over there.

00:32:44.650 --> 00:32:50.420
Well, let me emphasize some of
those points a little further.

00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:59.060
Let's suppose that I have a
Laplace transform, and the

00:32:59.060 --> 00:33:03.280
Laplace transform that I'm
talking about is a rational

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:09.610
function, which is 1 over
s plus 1 times s plus 2.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:14.460
Then the pole-zero pattern, as
it's referred to, in the

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:18.160
s-plane, the location of the
roots of the numerator and

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.490
denominator polynomials.

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.230
Of course, there is no
numerator polynomial.

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:25.850
The denominator polynomial
roots, which I've represented

00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:28.440
by these x's, are shown here.

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.430
And so this is the pole-zero
pattern.

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:37.690
And from what I've said, the
region of convergence can't

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:42.590
include any poles and it
must correspond to

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:44.860
strips in the s-plane.

00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:49.160
And furthermore, it must be
just one connected region

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.640
rather than multiple regions.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:57.090
And so with this algebraic
expression then, the possible

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.250
choices for the region of
convergence consistent with

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:02.550
those properties are
the following.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:05.830
One of them would be a region
of convergence to the

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:09.489
right of this pole.

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:16.190
A second would be a region of
convergence which lies between

00:34:16.190 --> 00:34:21.570
the two poles as I show here.

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:27.350
And a third is a region of
convergence which is to the

00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:31.199
left of this pole.

00:34:31.199 --> 00:34:36.010
And because of the fact that I
said without proof that the

00:34:36.010 --> 00:34:39.870
region of convergence must be
a single strip, it can't be

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:41.159
multiple strips.

00:34:41.159 --> 00:34:44.460
In fact, we could not consider,
as a possible region

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:48.060
of convergence, what
I show here.

00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.810
So, in fact, this is not a valid
region of convergence.

00:34:52.810 --> 00:34:56.750
There are only three
possibilities associated with

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:58.900
this pole-zero pattern.

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.270
Namely, to the right of this
pole, between the two poles,

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:06.500
and to the left of this pole.

00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:11.250
Now, to carry the discussion
further, we can, in fact,

00:35:11.250 --> 00:35:16.490
associate the region of
convergence of the Laplace

00:35:16.490 --> 00:35:21.180
transform with some very
specific characteristics of

00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:22.540
the time function.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:28.790
And what this will do is to
help us understand how for

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:32.320
various choices of the region
of convergence, the

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.740
interpretation that we
can impose on the

00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:37.310
related time function.

00:35:37.310 --> 00:35:40.360
Let me show you what I mean.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:46.860
Suppose that we start with a
time function as I indicate

00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:53.820
here, which is a finite duration
time function.

00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:58.230
In other words, it's 0 except
in some time interval.

00:35:58.230 --> 00:36:03.200
Now, recall that the Fourier
transform converges if the

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:06.580
time function has the property
that it's absolutely

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:07.450
integrable.

00:36:07.450 --> 00:36:10.870
And as long as everything's
stays finite in terms of

00:36:10.870 --> 00:36:14.130
amplitudes in a finite duration
signal, there's no

00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:17.830
difficulty that we're going
to run into here.

00:36:17.830 --> 00:36:21.040
Now, here the Fourier transform
will converge.

00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:25.920
And now the question is, what
can we say about the region of

00:36:25.920 --> 00:36:29.770
convergence of the Laplace
transform?

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:34.700
Well, the Laplace transform is
the Fourier transform of the

00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.810
time function multiplied
by an exponential.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:41.820
And so we can ask about whether
we can destroy the

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:45.560
absolute integrability of this
by multiplying by an

00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:49.510
exponential that grows
to fast or decays

00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:50.490
too fast, or whatever.

00:36:50.490 --> 00:36:53.130
And let's take a look at that.

00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:57.310
Suppose that this time function
is absolutely

00:36:57.310 --> 00:36:59.230
integrable.

00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:05.550
And let's multiply it by
a decaying exponential.

00:37:05.550 --> 00:37:09.540
So this is now x of t times z
to the minus sigma t if I

00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.960
think of multiplying
these two together.

00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:16.260
And what you can see is that
for positive time, sort of

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.140
thinking informally, I'm helping
the integrability of

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.680
the product because I'm pushing
this part down.

00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:25.960
For negative time,
unfortunately, I'm making

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.030
things grow.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:31.710
But I don't let them grow
indefinitely because there's

00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:36.180
some time before which
this is equal to 0.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:44.660
Likewise, if I had a growing
exponential, then for a

00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:48.960
growing exponential for negative
time, or for this

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.720
part, I'm making
things smaller.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.580
For positive time, eventually
this exponential is growing

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:56.930
without bound.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:01.370
But the time function
stops at some point.

00:38:01.370 --> 00:38:08.580
So the idea then kind of is
that for a finite duration

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:12.760
time function, no matter what
kind of exponential I multiply

00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:16.720
by, whether it's going this way
or going this way, because

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:19.870
of the fact that essentially the
limits on the integral are

00:38:19.870 --> 00:38:24.940
finite, I'm guaranteed that I'll
always maintain absolute

00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:26.370
integrability.

00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:30.890
And so, in fact then, for a
finite duration time function,

00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:33.800
the region of convergence
is the entire s-plane.

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.890
Now, we can also make statements
about other kinds

00:38:41.890 --> 00:38:43.470
of time functions.

00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:52.280
And let's look at a time
function which I define as a

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.470
right-sided time function.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:39:01.720
And a right-sided time function
is one which is 0 up

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:06.200
until some time, and then it
goes on after that, presumably

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:08.050
off to infinity.

00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:12.850
Now, let me remind you that the
whole issue here with the

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:18.540
region of convergence has to do
with exponentials that we

00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:23.850
can multiply a time function by
and have the product end up

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:26.430
being absolutely integrable.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:32.020
Well, suppose that when I
multiply this time function by

00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:35.400
an exponential which,
let's say decays.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.860
But an exponential e to the
minus sigma 0 t, what you can

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.730
see sort of intuitively is
that if this product is

00:39:43.730 --> 00:39:49.030
absolutely integrable, if I were
to increase sigma 0, then

00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:52.090
I'm making things even better
for positive time because I'm

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:53.640
pushing them down.

00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:57.730
And whereas they might be worse
for negative time, that

00:39:57.730 --> 00:40:01.170
doesn't matter because
before some time the

00:40:01.170 --> 00:40:02.540
product is equal to 0.

00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:08.200
So if this product is absolutely
integrable, then if

00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:12.840
I chose an exponential e to the
minus sigma 1t where sigma

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:17.370
1 is greater than sigma 0, then
that product will also be

00:40:17.370 --> 00:40:19.470
absolutely integrable.

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:23.270
And we can draw an important
conclusion about that, about

00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:25.420
the region of convergence
from that.

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:30.700
In particular, we can make the
statement that if the time

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:38.310
function is right-sided and if
convergence occurs for some

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:44.250
value sigma 0, then in fact,
we will have convergence of

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:49.700
the Laplace transform for all
values of the real part of s

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:51.770
greater than sigma 0.

00:40:51.770 --> 00:40:56.610
The reason, of course, being
that if sigma 0 increases,

00:40:56.610 --> 00:41:03.210
then the exponential decays even
faster for positive time.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.070
Now what that says then thinking
another way, in terms

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:09.700
of the region of convergence
as we might draw it in the

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:13.080
s-plane, is that if we have a
point that's in the region of

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:17.450
convergence corresponding to
some value sigma 0, then all

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:21.580
values of s to the right of that
in the s-plane will also

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:24.330
be in the region
of convergence.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:26.800
We can also combine that with
the statement that for

00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:31.490
rational functions we know that
there can't be any poles

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.190
in the region of convergence.

00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:36.190
If you put those two statements
together, then we

00:41:36.190 --> 00:41:41.830
end up with a statement that if
x of t is right-sided and

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:46.060
if its Laplace transform is
rational, then the region of

00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:51.280
convergence is to the right
of the rightmost pole.

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:55.130
So we have here a very important
insight, which tells

00:41:55.130 --> 00:41:59.980
us that we can infer some
property about the time

00:41:59.980 --> 00:42:02.640
function from the region
of convergence.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.880
Or conversely, if we know
something about the time

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:09.440
function, namely being
right-sided, then we can infer

00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.570
something about the region
of convergence.

00:42:12.570 --> 00:42:17.090
Well, in addition to right-sided
signals, we can

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:19.510
also have left-sided signals.

00:42:19.510 --> 00:42:22.370
And a left-sided signal is
essentially a right-sided

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:23.910
signal turned around.

00:42:23.910 --> 00:42:27.480
In other words, a left-sided
signal is one that is

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:30.460
0 after some time.

00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:32.850
Well, we can carry out
exactly the same

00:42:32.850 --> 00:42:34.580
kind of argument there.

00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:37.800
Namely, if the signal goes off
to infinity in the negative

00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:42.690
time direction and stops some
place for positive time, if I

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:46.110
have an exponential that I can
multiply it by and have that

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.620
product be absolutely
integrable.

00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:51.590
And if I choose an exponential
that decays even faster for

00:42:51.590 --> 00:42:54.560
negative time so that I'm
pushing the stuff way out

00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:58.830
there down even further,
then I enhance the

00:42:58.830 --> 00:43:00.850
integrability even more.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:03.830
And you might have to think
through that a little bit, but

00:43:03.830 --> 00:43:07.170
it's exactly the flip
side of the argument

00:43:07.170 --> 00:43:08.890
for right-sided signals.

00:43:08.890 --> 00:43:14.470
And the conclusion then is that
if we have a left-sided

00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:20.010
signal and we have a point, a
value of the real part of s

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:23.400
which is in the region of
convergence, then in fact, all

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:29.140
values to the left of that point
in the s-plane will also

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.500
be in the region
of convergence.

00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:35.330
Now, similar to the statement
that we made for right-sided

00:43:35.330 --> 00:43:39.230
signals, if x of t is left-sided
and, in fact, we're

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.720
talking about a rational Laplace
transform, which we

00:43:41.720 --> 00:43:43.830
most typically will.

00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:47.730
Then, in fact, we can make the
statement that the region of

00:43:47.730 --> 00:43:53.290
convergence is to the left of
the leftmost pole because we

00:43:53.290 --> 00:43:56.730
know if we find a point that's
in the region of convergence,

00:43:56.730 --> 00:43:58.930
everything to the left of that
has to be in the region of

00:43:58.930 --> 00:43:59.870
convergence.

00:43:59.870 --> 00:44:02.480
We can't have any poles in the
region of convergence.

00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.960
You put those two statements
together and it says it's to

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.710
the left of the leftmost pole.

00:44:07.710 --> 00:44:12.340
Now the final situation is the
situation where we have a

00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:14.680
signal which is neither
right-sided nor left-sided.

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.010
It goes off to infinity for
positive time and it goes off

00:44:18.010 --> 00:44:20.100
to infinity for negative time.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:23.460
And there the thing to kind of
recognize is that if you

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:28.370
multiply by an exponential, and
it's decaying very fast

00:44:28.370 --> 00:44:30.750
for positive time, it's going
to be growing very fast for

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.060
negative time.

00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:35.060
Conversely, if it's decaying
very fast for negative time,

00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:37.530
it's growing very fast
for positive time.

00:44:37.530 --> 00:44:39.840
And there's this notion
of trying to balance

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.710
the value of sigma.

00:44:41.710 --> 00:44:44.620
And in effect, what that says
is that the region of

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.810
convergence can't extent
too far to the left or

00:44:47.810 --> 00:44:49.450
too far to the right.

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:55.790
Said another way for a two-sided
signal, if we have a

00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:59.560
point which is in the region
of convergence, then that

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:06.530
point defines a strip in the
s-plane that takes that point

00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:09.960
and extends it to the left until
you bump into a pole,

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.990
and extends it to the right
until you bump it into a pole.

00:45:15.845 --> 00:45:20.460
So you begin to then see that
we can tie together some

00:45:20.460 --> 00:45:24.040
properties of the region
of convergence and the

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.940
right-sidedness, or
left-sidedness, or

00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:29.030
two-sidedness of the
time function.

00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:32.750
And you'll have a chance to
examine that in more detail in

00:45:32.750 --> 00:45:35.010
the video course manual.

00:45:35.010 --> 00:45:41.440
Let's conclude this lecture by
talking about how we might get

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:46.040
the time function given the
appliance transform.

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:49.830
Well, if we have a Laplace
transform, we can, in

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:53.010
principle, get the time
function back again by

00:45:53.010 --> 00:45:56.230
recognizing this relationship
between the Laplace transform

00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:59.360
and the Fourier transform, and
using the formal Fourier

00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:00.650
transform expression.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:04.510
Or equivalently, the formal
inverse Laplace transform

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:07.190
expression, which
is in the text.

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:11.040
But more typically what we would
do is what we've done

00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:15.910
also with the Fourier transform,
which is to use

00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:21.580
simple Laplace transform pairs
together with the notion of

00:46:21.580 --> 00:46:23.490
the partial fraction
expansion.

00:46:23.490 --> 00:46:28.020
And let's just go through
that with an example.

00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:34.350
Let's suppose that I have
a Laplace transform as I

00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:38.380
indicated here in its pole-zero
plot and a region of

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:42.060
convergence which is to the
right of this pole.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.140
And what we can identify from
the region of convergence, in

00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:47.980
fact, is that we're
talking about a

00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.660
right-sided time function.

00:46:50.660 --> 00:46:54.300
So the region of convergence is
the real part of s greater

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.900
than minus 1.

00:46:55.900 --> 00:47:01.050
And now looking down at the
algebraic expression, we have

00:47:01.050 --> 00:47:04.610
the algebraic expression for
this, as I indicated here,

00:47:04.610 --> 00:47:09.560
equivalently expanded in a
partial fraction expansion, as

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.250
I show below.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:13.590
So if you just simply combine
these together, that's the

00:47:13.590 --> 00:47:15.030
same as this.

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:19.360
And the region of convergence is
the real part of s greater

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.410
than minus 1.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:24.830
Now, the region of
convergence of--

00:47:24.830 --> 00:47:28.360
this is the sum of two terms,
so the time function is the

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.320
sum of two time functions.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:37.760
And the region of convergence of
the combination must be the

00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.850
intersection of the region
of convergence

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:41.960
associated with each one.

00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:46.990
Recognizing that this is to the
right of the poles, that

00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:51.290
tells us immediately that each
of these two then would

00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:55.110
correspond to the Laplace
transform of a right-sided

00:47:55.110 --> 00:47:57.180
time function.

00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.910
Well, let's look at
it term by term.

00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:06.620
The first term is the factor 1
over s plus 1 with a region of

00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:10.620
convergence to the right
of this pole.

00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:15.070
And this algebraically
corresponds

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:16.510
to what I've indicated.

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:21.610
And this, in fact, is similar
to, or a special case of the

00:48:21.610 --> 00:48:24.940
example that we pointed to at
the beginning of the lecture.

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.010
Namely, Example 9.1.

00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:29.370
And so we can just simply
use that result.

00:48:29.370 --> 00:48:32.120
If you think back to that
example or refer to your

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:37.570
notes, we know that time
function of the form e to the

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:41.360
minus a t gives us the Laplace
transform, which is 1 over s

00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:47.530
plus a with the real part of
s greater than minus a.

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:50.620
And so this is the Laplace
transform of the first.

00:48:50.620 --> 00:48:53.080
Or, I'm sorry, this is the
inverse Laplace transform of

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:55.310
the first term.

00:48:55.310 --> 00:49:03.610
If we now consider the pole at
s equals minus 2, and here is

00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:06.790
the region of convergence that
we originally began with.

00:49:06.790 --> 00:49:12.370
In fact, we can having removed
the pole at minus 1, extend

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:16.370
this region of convergence
to this pole.

00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:21.820
And we now have an algebraic
expression, which is minus 1

00:49:21.820 --> 00:49:26.370
over s plus 2, the real part
of s greater than minus 1.

00:49:26.370 --> 00:49:29.190
Although, in fact, we can
extend the region of

00:49:29.190 --> 00:49:31.870
convergence up to the pole.

00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:37.250
And the inverse transform of
this is now, again, referring

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:40.840
to the same example, minus
e to the minus 2t

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:43.210
times the unit step.

00:49:43.210 --> 00:49:49.530
And if we simply put the two
terms together then, adding

00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:54.100
the one that we have here to
what we had before, we have a

00:49:54.100 --> 00:50:00.860
total inverse Laplace transform,
which is that.

00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:05.890
So essentially, what's happened
is that each of the

00:50:05.890 --> 00:50:09.540
poles has contributed an
exponential factor.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:13.030
And because of the region of
convergence being to the right

00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:18.000
of all those poles, that is
consistent with the notion

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.080
that both of those terms
correspond to

00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:22.720
right-sided time functions.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:29.260
Well, let's just focus for a
second or two on the same

00:50:29.260 --> 00:50:31.260
pole-zero pattern.

00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:36.620
But instead of a region of
convergence which is to the

00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:40.030
right of the poles as we had
before, we'll now take a

00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:43.310
region of convergence which
is between the two poles.

00:50:43.310 --> 00:50:47.700
And I'll let you work through
this more leisurely in the

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.510
video course manual.

00:50:49.510 --> 00:50:53.200
But when we carry out the
partial fraction expansion, as

00:50:53.200 --> 00:51:00.060
I've done below, we would now
associate with this pole a

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:02.490
region of convergence
to the right.

00:51:02.490 --> 00:51:07.200
With this pole, a region of
convergence to the left.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:13.610
And so what we would have is the
sum of a right-sided time

00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:15.520
function due to this pole.

00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:20.160
And in fact it's of the form e
to the minus t for t positive.

00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:26.330
And a left-sided time function
due to this pole.

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:28.590
And in fact, that's of
the form e to the

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:30.970
minus 2t for t negative.

00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:35.280
And so, in fact, the answer
that we will get when we

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:39.120
decompose this, use the partial
fraction expansion,

00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:42.870
being very careful about
associating the region of

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:46.230
convergence of this pole to the
right and of this pole to

00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:50.530
the left, we'll have then, when
we're all done, a time

00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:55.570
function which will be of the
form e to the minus t times

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:58.660
the unit step for t positive.

00:51:58.660 --> 00:52:03.380
And then we'll have a term
of the form e to the--

00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:06.750
I'm sorry, this would be e to
the minus 2t since this is at

00:52:06.750 --> 00:52:09.150
minus 2 and this
is at minus 1.

00:52:09.150 --> 00:52:11.960
This would be a plus sign and
this would be minus e to the

00:52:11.960 --> 00:52:15.300
minus t for t negative.

00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:20.120
And you'll look at that a little
more carefully when you

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:21.970
sit down with the video
course manual.

00:52:24.950 --> 00:52:28.920
OK, well, what we've gone
through, rather quickly, is an

00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:32.510
introduction to the
Laplace transform.

00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:36.970
And a couple of points to
underscore again, is the fact

00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:41.190
that the Laplace transform is
very closely associated with

00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:42.690
the Fourier transform.

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:47.280
And in fact, the Laplace
transform for s equals j omega

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:49.570
reduces to the Fourier
transform.

00:52:49.570 --> 00:52:52.790
But more generally, the Laplace
transform is the

00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:59.760
Fourier transform of x of t with
an exponential weighting.

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.870
And there are some exponentials
for which that

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:05.010
product converges.

00:53:05.010 --> 00:53:08.430
There are other exponentials for
which that product has a

00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:10.780
Fourier transform that
doesn't converge.

00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:14.370
That then imposes on the
discussion of the Laplace

00:53:14.370 --> 00:53:18.860
transform what we refer to as
the region of convergence.

00:53:18.860 --> 00:53:22.670
And it's very important to
understand that in specifying

00:53:22.670 --> 00:53:28.670
a Laplace transform, it's
important to identify not only

00:53:28.670 --> 00:53:34.870
the algebraic expression, but
also the values of s for which

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:35.620
it's valid.

00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:37.740
Namely, the region
of convergence

00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:39.490
of the Laplace transform.

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:44.350
Finally what we did was to tie
together some properties of a

00:53:44.350 --> 00:53:48.200
time function with things that
we can say about the region of

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:52.060
convergence of its Laplace
transform.

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:54.910
Now, just as with the Fourier
transform, the Laplace

00:53:54.910 --> 00:53:58.670
transform has some very
important properties.

00:53:58.670 --> 00:54:04.140
And out of these properties,
both are some mechanisms for

00:54:04.140 --> 00:54:09.760
using the Laplace transform
for such systems as those

00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:12.280
described by linear constant
coefficient

00:54:12.280 --> 00:54:14.080
differential equations.

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.900
But more importantly, the
properties will help us.

00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:23.550
As we understand them further,
will help us in using and

00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:27.890
exploiting the Laplace transform
to study and

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:31.700
understand linear time-invariant
systems.

00:54:31.700 --> 00:54:34.970
And that's what we'll
go on to next time.

00:54:34.970 --> 00:54:38.530
In particular, talking about
properties, and then

00:54:38.530 --> 00:54:42.610
associating with linear
time-invariant systems much of

00:54:42.610 --> 00:54:46.610
the discussion that we've
had today relating

00:54:46.610 --> 00:54:48.040
to the Laplace transform.

00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:49.290
Thank you.

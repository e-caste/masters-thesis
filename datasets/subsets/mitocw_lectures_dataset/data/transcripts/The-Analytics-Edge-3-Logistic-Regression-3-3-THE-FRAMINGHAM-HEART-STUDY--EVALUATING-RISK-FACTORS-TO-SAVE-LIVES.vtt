00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:09.270
In this lecture, we'll describe
the Framingham Heart Study, one

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.180
of the most important
epidemiological studies ever

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.110
conducted, and the
underlying analytics that

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.170
led to our current understanding
of cardiovascular disease.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.060
To motivate how the study
affected our understanding

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.870
of blood pressure today,
we describe the case

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.060
of Franklin Delano
Roosevelt, FDR

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.680
for short, who was the
President of the United States

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.350
from 1933 to 1945.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.300
He was the longest-serving
president of the United States,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.220
and he led the country
during difficult times --

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.460
the Great Depression,
and World War II.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:51.670
He died while President
on April 12, 1945.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:00.510
Before the presidency, FDR's
blood pressure was 140/100.

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.680
Today, healthy blood
pressure is considered

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.350
to be less than 120/80.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.070
So therefore, 140/100 is today
considered high blood pressure.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.650
One year before his death, his
blood pressure was 210/120.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.860
Today this is called
hypertensive crisis,

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.920
and emergency care is needed.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.380
On the other hand,
FDR's personal physician

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.000
said a moderate degree
of atherosclerosis

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.500
although no more than
normal for a man of his age.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.180
Two months before his death,
his blood pressure was 260/150,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.960
and the day of his
death was 300/190.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.970
There were early misconceptions
in the first half

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.729
of the 20th century
about blood pressure.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.600
High blood pressure, dubbed
essential hypertension,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.350
was considered important to
force blood through arteries,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.240
and it was considered harmful
to lower blood pressure.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.979
Today, of course,
we know better.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.100
In the words of Daniel Levy,
the Framingham Heart Study

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.110
director, "today presidential
blood pressure numbers

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.310
like FDR's would send the
country's leading doctors

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.690
racing down hallways,
whisking the nation's leader

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:32.020
into the cardiac care unit
of Bethesda Naval Hospital."

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.980
So how did we learn?

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.329
In the late 1940s,
the US government

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:43.220
set out to better understand
cardiovascular disease.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.890
The plan was to track a large
cohort of initially healthy

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.350
patients over their lifetimes.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.950
A city was chosen, the city
of Framingham, Massachusetts,

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.890
to be the site for the study.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.130
Framingham has an
appropriate size.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.040
It's not too large,
it's not too small.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.890
It has a stable population
that doesn't move too much.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.690
And the doctors and residents
were quite cooperative.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.180
So in 1948, the Framingham
Heart Study started.

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:32.820
The study included 5,209
patients, aged 30 to 59.

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.690
Patients were given
a questionnaire

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.930
and an examination
every two years.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.820
During this examination,
their physical characteristics

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.260
were recorded, their behavioral
characteristics, as well as

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.120
test results.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.020
Exams and questions
expanded over time,

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.560
but the key in the study
was that the trajectory

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.270
of the health of
the patients was

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.260
followed during their
entire lifespan.

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.530
In this class, we
will build models

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.750
using the Framingham data
to predict and prevent

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.580
heart disease.

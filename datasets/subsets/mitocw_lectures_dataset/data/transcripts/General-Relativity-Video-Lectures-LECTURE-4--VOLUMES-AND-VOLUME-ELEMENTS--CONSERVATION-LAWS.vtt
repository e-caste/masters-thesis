00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.924
[SQUEAKING]

00:00:01.924 --> 00:00:03.367
[RUSTLING]

00:00:03.367 --> 00:00:04.810
[CLICKING]

00:00:10.467 --> 00:00:11.050
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:11.950
Great.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.640
So at this point,
we basically have

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.850
all of the most
important-- well,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.300
we now have the
full understanding

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.560
of how to work with tensors.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.893
I haven't really done too
much physics with them at this

00:00:22.893 --> 00:00:25.420
point, but we've
very carefully--

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.330
one might even argue
excessively carefully--

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.190
laid out this
mathematical structure

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.710
that is going to
be-- we're going

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.450
to use it to contain the
geometric objects that

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.950
will describe the
physics that we're

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.070
going to study over the
course of the entire semester.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.720
So there was a lot of twiddly
detail in the preceding

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.350
lecture, but I would say the
two most important things I want

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.550
you to take out of this is the
idea that we now have tensors

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.180
as a general class of geometric
objects which map one-forms--

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.520
or dual vectors, if you prefer--

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.260
a combination of one-forms
and vectors to the Lorentz

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.930
invariant real numbers.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.200
And further, the distinction
between one-forms, and vectors,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.660
and what is being mapped to what
is not so important, because I

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:13.930
can always use the metric
to either raise or lower

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.810
indices on tensors or
vectors or one forms

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.650
in order to convert
from one to another.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.890
So if I raise an index--
if I have a tensor that's

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.930
got m indices in the
upstairs position

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.790
and n in the downstairs,
I raise an index,

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.760
and I've got m plus 1
upstairs, n minus 1 downstairs.

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.928
And likewise, I
can lower index--

00:01:29.928 --> 00:01:31.720
put one of those ones
in the upstairs, down

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.168
to the downstairs.

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:36.460
We wanted to go through all
that stuff with great care,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.585
because we're going to need
the foundations of that

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:41.170
to make a lot of what we
talk about later rigorous.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.410
It is really overkill
for where we're starting,

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.980
but it's worthwhile to have
that scaffolding in place.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.972
I'm sick of it,
though, so today I'm

00:01:49.972 --> 00:01:51.430
going to try to do
some things that

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.005
are more physics, because,
well, not all of you

00:01:55.005 --> 00:01:56.380
are necessarily
physics students,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.210
but I'm a physics
professor and I'm

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.830
a little tired of doing math.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.240
So let's think about--

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.960
when we're studying
physics, generally we

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.857
are interested in the
behavior of bodies and fields.

00:02:08.857 --> 00:02:10.690
Let's move this to the
relativity framework.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.080
We're looking at the behavior of
bodies and fields in spacetime.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.320
So far, if I think
about the quantities

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.030
that we have introduced--

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.740
and by the way, I apologize
for the blackboards.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.760
A previous lecturer today used
chalk that cannot be erased

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.030
very well, so they're sort
of grayish boards today,

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.620
unfortunately.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.840
But we'll manage.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:41.870
Anyhow, so far, the quantities
that we have introduced

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.840
that have solid
physics content are

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.860
good for describing particles--

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.010
individual particles-- maybe
a handful of them at once.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.420
So the two that I want to
focus on in particular are

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.470
the 4-velocity--

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.830
so if I have a body
with a 4-velocity u,

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:11.670
a particular Lorentz observer
will describe that as having

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.950
a timelike component gamma--

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.980
special relativistic gamma-- and
a spacelike component gamma v.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.280
This is defined such that
u dot u equals minus 1.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.070
It is great for
describing-- it is

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.280
the tool we use to describe the
trajectory of a material body

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.310
that follows a timelike
trajectory through spacetime.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.170
Notice that its norm is minus 1.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.230
The fact that it's 1 means
that it's normalized,

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.150
and the minus tells us
that it is timelike.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.030
By the way, because
this is timelike,

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.720
the 4-velocity is not going
to be a useful tool for us

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.102
when we want to describe
the behavior of light.

00:04:01.102 --> 00:04:02.560
If we want to talk
about the motion

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.460
of a photon in our spacetime, we
can't use a 4-velocity for it.

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.580
The trajectory of
a photon is null.

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.330
Whatever quantity that is going
to describe its trajectory--

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.160
I take its dot product with
itself, I have to get 0.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.657
And you can
intuitively get a sense

00:04:19.657 --> 00:04:20.740
what's going on with that.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.460
If I take the way a
particular observer interprets

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.640
these things and
says, what would

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.130
this turn into if v
equals c, well, you

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.760
have infinity and infinity,
because your gammas

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:33.640
are diverging there.

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:34.810
So it's a singular limit.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.640
It doesn't behave well.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.724
We will overcome
this difficulty.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.375
The other quantity
that we have used--

00:04:45.375 --> 00:04:47.500
let me see if I can clean
this a little bit better.

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.930
All right.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.690
The other quantity
that we have defined

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:02.530
which is good for particles
is the 4-momentum,

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:12.390
which is just that 4-velocity
multiplied by a rest mass.

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:13.960
So this is defined--
you can clearly,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.020
by trimming together a
bunch of definitions--

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.102
you have p dot p
equals minus m squared.

00:05:21.102 --> 00:05:23.060
We're actually going to
interpret this, though.

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.850
So if a particular
Lorentz observer

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.710
makes a measurement
of this, they

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:33.850
will call the timelike component
E and the spatial component p.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:35.650
And so you put all
these things together,

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:42.360
and this tells me that E
squared minus magnitude of p

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.240
squared equals m squared.

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.550
Notice this is
perfectly well-behaved

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:49.700
for a massless particle.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:51.700
This is actually going
to be the trick by which,

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.180
when I want to describe
the trajectory of photons

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.280
or of light in a spacetime--

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.690
I can't use 4-velocity.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.150
I can use 4-momentum.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.170
It works perfectly well.

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:06.528
It's 0 times a 4-velocity, but
if I use this intuition that

00:06:06.528 --> 00:06:09.070
this thing is diverging when I
take the speed of light limit,

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.135
I sort of--

00:06:10.135 --> 00:06:11.560
I guess I cheat,
but I'm basically

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:13.720
getting 0 times infinity.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.280
And it behaves.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:16.780
We're going to do it a little
bit more rigorously than that,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.530
but if you want a
little bit of intuition,

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.955
that's essentially why it works.

00:06:19.955 --> 00:06:21.580
So the last thing
which I will say here

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:27.000
is that this is
good for m equals 0.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.580
OK.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:33.340
And when you do have
m equals 0, it's

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.020
often convenient to write
this as h bar omega.

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.610
So use the usual formula
for the energy of a photon--

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:45.190
let me move this so
that you can see--

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.650
and then I just
put a unit vector

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.300
into the spatial direction
that defines the direction

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:53.300
in which this is moving.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.300
OK.

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:18.500
So this is all fine
as far as it goes,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.290
but it's kind of restrictive.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.180
We want to a little bit
more with our physics

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.910
than just worry
about the kinetics

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:26.150
of individual particles.

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.030
There's a lot we
can do with that,

00:07:28.030 --> 00:07:29.770
but one of the
things that we like

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:31.990
to do when we're
studying gravity

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:34.930
is to have a description
of continual matter,

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.560
like things that gravitate.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.820
You want to be able to build a
description of something like

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.300
a star, or an exotic
star-- a neutron star--

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.900
something like that.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:47.928
And so just having the behavior
of individual particles

00:07:47.928 --> 00:07:48.720
is not good enough.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:49.960
I want to be able to
describe things like fluids.

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.210
I want to be able to
have a continuum that

00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:53.240
describes things.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.850
So what I'm going
to start doing today

00:07:54.850 --> 00:07:57.280
is begin to introduce
the mathematical tools

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:58.990
that we will use.

00:07:58.990 --> 00:07:59.490
Pardon me.

00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.020
I seem to have twisted this
around myself in a crazy way.

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.650
We're going to describe
the mathematical tools that

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:10.480
are useful for dealing
with continuous matter,

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.998
rather than just particles.

00:08:14.810 --> 00:08:18.280
So let's call this more
interesting matter.

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.940
So the simplest continuum
form of matter which

00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:38.030
we're going to talk about is--

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.980
we're going to call it dust.

00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.961
OK.

00:08:40.961 --> 00:08:42.419
When you're here
at the chalkboard,

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:43.836
you can't get away
with it, so you

00:08:43.836 --> 00:08:45.090
have an idea of what it means.

00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:48.630
Physically, what
I mean by dust is

00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:51.690
that it is a collection
of particles that do not

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.950
interact with each other.

00:08:52.950 --> 00:08:54.910
So they pass through each other.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:57.070
There's no pressure
that is generated.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:09:10.440
So they have energy density
associated with them,

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.980
but no interaction.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.188
So it's the most boring kind
of matter that you like.

00:09:15.188 --> 00:09:17.272
You can think of it as
essentially just particles,

00:09:17.272 --> 00:09:18.800
but it's a ton of
them, and they're

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.222
smearing out into a continuum.

00:09:22.222 --> 00:09:23.930
In particular, one
thing I'm going to say

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:29.800
is, so I can imagine, if I
take my two erasers here,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.570
I have a nice dust
field in front of me

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:35.600
now, which I helpfully
just inhaled.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.900
And you can think of this
thing as a field of little dust

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.030
elements that are
all moving around.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:44.090
If I go in and I track
an individual element

00:09:44.090 --> 00:09:44.780
of that dust--

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.520
I go in and I make
a little cube that's

00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.590
a nanometer on each side--

00:09:48.590 --> 00:09:52.560
every little element
has its own rest frame.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.560
In that cloud-- I'm not
going to do that again--

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.900
but as I made that
cloud, different elements

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.270
within the cloud have
different rest frames,

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:02.840
but for each individual element,
I can define a rest frame.

00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:08.320
So we're going to
use the properties

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.350
of the dust in that rest
frame as a way of beginning

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.742
to normalize and
get a grasp on how

00:10:13.742 --> 00:10:14.950
we're going to describe this.

00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:35.000
But I just want to emphasize
again-- in a given cloud,

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:42.528
different elements may
have different rest frames.

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:50.710
OK.

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.680
But let's suppose that
I clap my erasers,

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:55.720
I make my little cloud,
and I go and I zoom in

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.260
on one particular
nanometer by nanometer

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.890
by nanometer chunk
of that thing,

00:11:00.890 --> 00:11:03.640
and I go into the rest frame
of that particular little bit

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.290
of dust.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:07.870
So how am I going to
characterize that?

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.480
So presumably, each
particle has its own mass

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.830
associated with it.

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.752
Each little bit of dust that's
in that thing has its own mass.

00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.210
We're going to
worry about how that

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:28.100
comes into the picture
a little bit later.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.715
Let's just begin by saying,
one of the things it's

00:11:29.715 --> 00:11:31.090
going to be
interested in knowing

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.700
is, how much dust is there in
that little cubic nanometer

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:37.380
of dust in front of me there?

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:44.220
So the first thing
we're going to focus on

00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:55.532
is just counting how many bits
of dust are in this element.

00:11:55.532 --> 00:11:57.990
In particular, I'm going to
want to know, how many elements

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.160
per unit volume?

00:12:06.922 --> 00:12:08.380
In other words,
the number density.

00:12:11.957 --> 00:12:14.290
So I claim that's a good thing
for us to get started on.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:20.232
And it looks like
they haven't quite

00:12:20.232 --> 00:12:21.440
poisoned this board as badly.

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.280
Good.

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:31.310
So let's call n sub
0 the number density

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.160
in the rest frame
of that element.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:43.730
OK.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:46.860
So this will just be some
number per unit volume.

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.360
OK.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:51.540
So it's a quantity that has
dimensions 1 over volume.

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:54.340
Now, in the rest
frame, like I said,

00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:58.492
we're going to talk about how
I treat the mass associated

00:12:58.492 --> 00:13:00.200
with each element,
and how much energy is

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.930
in that thing, a
little bit later.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.880
There's a few other tools
I want to introduce first

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.730
before I get to there.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:09.220
But in the rest
frame, if I'm not

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.345
worrying about the mass
and the energy, this is it.

00:13:11.345 --> 00:13:13.680
This is really the only
thing I can say about this.

00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:16.580
So what do I'm going to do
now is say, OK, well, if I

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.777
have a general cloud here--

00:13:18.777 --> 00:13:21.110
as I described, when we made
this little turbulent cloud

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.420
of dust in front of us,
it was all swirling around

00:13:23.420 --> 00:13:25.370
and doing its own thing.

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:27.010
You're generally not
in the rest frame.

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:27.510
OK.

00:13:27.510 --> 00:13:31.760
So you also want to know how
to characterize the dust out

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.000
of the rest frame.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.161
So let's move out
of the rest frame.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:43.720
When I do this,
two things happen.

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:58.790
So first of all, let's
continue to focus on--

00:13:58.790 --> 00:14:01.750
so we've got a particular
nanometer cubed of dust

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:03.230
that we are looking at here.

00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:05.760
So we're very attached
to that particular thing.

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.135
So I now boost
into a frame where

00:14:07.135 --> 00:14:08.980
I'm going 3/4 of the speed of
light or something like that,

00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.110
but I'm going to pay
attention to that--

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:13.240
I'm very attached to the
dust in that little cube,

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.150
so I'm going to keep
myself focused on that.

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:19.070
Boosting into frame can't
change the total number,

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:22.420
so the amount of dust
has to be the same.

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:25.310
But of course, there's going
to be a Lorentz contraction,

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:27.565
and so the volume
will get smaller.

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:35.680
So the number in a
particular volume

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:44.435
stays the same while the
volume Lorentz contracts.

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:57.770
And so let's call n the number
density in this new frame.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:06.770
This is just going to be
the Lorentz gamma times n0.

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:17.230
So again, I'm assuming
you're all perfectly

00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:18.530
fluent with special relativity.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.530
So all I did there was say
it's going to contract along

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:21.220
that direction.

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:23.650
The lengths are smaller
by a factor of gamma,

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:26.170
therefore the volume is
larger by a factor of gamma.

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.170
But there's a second thing
that happens as well.

00:15:28.170 --> 00:15:29.890
When I'm in this
new frame, there

00:15:29.890 --> 00:15:33.730
is now a flow associated
with the dust.

00:15:49.030 --> 00:15:52.790
So this will now be
flowing through space.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.370
In particular,
what you can do is

00:15:54.370 --> 00:16:00.280
define a flux that describes
the number of particles crossing

00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.130
unit area in unit time.

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:24.787
So let's define n
3-vector to be this.

00:16:24.787 --> 00:16:26.370
And you use a little
bit of intuition,

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:29.370
and just think about the flow
of these particles as they

00:16:29.370 --> 00:16:32.070
kind of go translating past you.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:37.200
This can only be
the number density

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:44.300
that you measure in that
frame times the 3-velocity.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:45.030
OK?

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:45.780
Think about that a little bit.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:47.280
It's very much
like when you learn

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:53.520
about current density in basic
E&M. Notice it's n and not n0

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.390
here.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:58.850
So when you look at these two
things for a moment or two--

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:01.140
let me just write
down one more step.

00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:09.930
I can write this as gamma n0 v.

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.440
These are screaming to be put
together to make a 4-vector.

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.750
They're looking at
you and saying--

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:19.170
this bit's kind of like, I'm a
timelike piece of a 4-vector.

00:17:19.170 --> 00:17:20.490
Spatial piece, I love you.

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:21.900
Let's get together.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.245
They clearly are just
screaming to go together.

00:17:24.245 --> 00:17:27.060
And when you do
that, you say, hmm,

00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:28.820
let's see what happens here.

00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.330
Two great tastes that
taste great together.

00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:35.730
OK.

00:17:35.730 --> 00:17:38.100
That's nice.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.620
Let's take advantage of
the fact that both of these

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:42.420
have a really
simple form in terms

00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.060
of the density in the
dust's own rest frame.

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:52.080
And you look at this
and go, holy moly.

00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.670
That is nothing
more than the number

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:56.220
density times a 4-velocity.

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:05.550
So that's pretty cool.

00:18:05.550 --> 00:18:07.140
If I have this stuff
in front of me--

00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:08.520
you know, again, what the heck.

00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.980
This time I'm going to
actually do my clap again.

00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.760
So I do this.

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.230
Every little element--

00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:16.320
I can think of it as having some
trajectory through spacetime.

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:19.360
I can attach a
4-velocity to that.

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:23.310
And if I know what the density
of dust is in that rest frame,

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:25.830
I put it together-- now I've
got a geometric object that

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.280
describes this thing.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.980
And one of the reasons
why this is powerful is,

00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.130
geometric objects-- as I
have emphasized repeatedly--

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:39.630
have a geometric
meaning that transcends

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:42.120
a particular coordinate
representation.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.840
Another way to think about
this is that all observers--

00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.330
I don't care whether you're
at rest in this classroom,

00:18:48.330 --> 00:18:49.997
or you've had too
much coffee and you're

00:18:49.997 --> 00:18:51.940
dashing through at 3/4
the speed of light.

00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:54.750
We all agree on N--

00:18:54.750 --> 00:18:59.610
capital N vector-- but we choose
different ways of splitting

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:01.990
spacetime into space and time.

00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:04.170
And so I will have a
different n from you,

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:06.690
I will have a
different nv from you.

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.312
We all have different ways
of splitting this spacetime

00:19:09.312 --> 00:19:10.770
into space and
time, and so we have

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:12.870
different ways of splitting
these two things up.

00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:15.323
But this is a geometric
object we all agree on.

00:19:15.323 --> 00:19:17.490
It's something that we can
hang a lot of our physics

00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:24.120
on, and build frame-independent
powerful geometric

00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:25.870
representations.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.520
So before going on to do
a few things with this,

00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.770
let's just explore a couple
of the properties of this.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.130
All right.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:55.465
So whenever you've got a
4-vector, at a certain point,

00:19:55.465 --> 00:19:56.840
you just sort of
say to yourself,

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.935
well, I've got this thing.

00:19:57.935 --> 00:19:59.560
Let's take the dot
product with itself.

00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.060
Why not?

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.960
So in this case, N dot N
equals minus n0 squared.

00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:11.620
Or, turning this
around, this tells you

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.590
that if someone comes buy
and goes, psst, here's

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:18.370
a number 4-vector,
you can figure out

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:23.030
density in the rest frame
associated with each element

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:25.195
by the following operations.

00:20:25.195 --> 00:20:26.020
So that's nice.

00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:26.520
OK.

00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:29.230
In other words, the number
density, in a sense,

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.360
tells you what the
normalization of this vector is.

00:20:36.490 --> 00:20:39.340
A few moments ago,
I defined N as being

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.270
kind of a flux of these things.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:46.900
It's a flux in the
spatial directions.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:50.780
We want to think about flux
in a more general kind of way.

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:54.070
And so another thing
which we're going to do--

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.290
and this is where 1-forms are
going to play an important role

00:20:57.290 --> 00:20:57.790
for us--

00:21:03.140 --> 00:21:10.185
is a nice systematic way to pick
out a flux across a surface.

00:21:15.333 --> 00:21:17.500
So here's the bit where,
when I was talking about it

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.050
in Tuesday's lecture, I was
getting the blank stares.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.400
And sorry, I'm coming
right back to this again,

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.720
so we're going to harp on this
concept a little bit more.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.290
So recall we talked
about the fact

00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.520
that if I have a particular
coordinate system--

00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:33.550
I have a particular set
of coordinates x alpha

00:21:33.550 --> 00:21:36.430
that I use to
represent spacetime.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:41.000
If I make 1-forms that are the
gradients of those coordinates,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:51.300
I can represent
them as essentially,

00:21:51.300 --> 00:22:03.100
level surfaces at unit ticks
of the coordinate x alpha.

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:03.840
OK.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:05.465
And basically, the
way to think of it--

00:22:05.465 --> 00:22:09.020
I kept emphasizing that
the basis 1-forms are

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.157
dual to basis vectors.

00:22:11.157 --> 00:22:13.490
And if you have this intuition
that your basis vector is

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.040
a little arrow pointing
like so, then the thing

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:20.090
that is dual to it is a surface
that is everywhere but pointing

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:20.873
along like so.

00:22:20.873 --> 00:22:23.040
That's kind of the way I
want you to think about it.

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.593
And those graphics that are
scans from MTW I put on the web

00:22:26.593 --> 00:22:28.760
give better pictures of
that than I am able to draw.

00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:52.970
So putting these
concepts together,

00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:54.980
it basically tells
me that I can use

00:22:54.980 --> 00:23:00.830
these basis 1-forms as a way of
defining in an abstract form.

00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:13.060
So if I want to know
the flux of N in the--

00:23:13.060 --> 00:23:14.320
let's write it this way--

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:24.710
in the x alpha direction.

00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:28.510
So remember, the basis 1-forms--

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:31.480
the alpha in that case is
not like a coordinate index.

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.070
It's labeling a particular
member of a set.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:37.070
And so what you would do is, you
would construct this by saying,

00:23:37.070 --> 00:23:46.300
OK, let's take the beta
component of a basis

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:49.610
1-form alpha.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.830
Contract it like so.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:03.470
And that tells me about the
flux-- how much of this stuff

00:24:03.470 --> 00:24:07.180
is flowing in the direction
associated with alpha.

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:09.680
So this is a tool that we're
going to use from time to time.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.180
One little thing which I
want to emphasize-- actually,

00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.630
two things I want to emphasize.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.440
So if I'm working in an
intelligent coordinate system,

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:23.860
remember, this is basically
just the identity matrix, right?

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.560
And so this ends up being a very
simple thing that I actually

00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:27.060
work out.

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:29.420
And it says, if I want to
know the timelike component,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.990
then this is 1 in the timelike
direction, 0 everywhere else,

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:34.960
and I just pick out N sub t--

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.980
in other words, the density
itself in that frame.

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.210
That is the other thing
which I want to emphasize.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:50.990
So when you do this, if I pick
out the timelike piece of this,

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.080
this just gives
me the 0 component

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:56.480
of this thing,
which is the density

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.610
that I measure in this frame.

00:24:58.610 --> 00:25:00.860
This is very, very simple
in terms of the calculation,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.100
but I want you to stop and think
about what it means physically.

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.665
So flux in the timelike
direction-- what

00:25:06.665 --> 00:25:09.290
does it mean for a flux to be in
the timelike direction, right?

00:25:09.290 --> 00:25:11.057
If i take my water--

00:25:11.057 --> 00:25:13.640
actually, I'm kind of thirsty--
so I want a little bit of flux

00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:16.547
of water going down my throat.

00:25:16.547 --> 00:25:18.380
You have an intuition
about what that means.

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:21.710
The water's actually flowing
in a particular direction.

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.970
If it's flowing through time--

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:26.835
there it goes.

00:25:26.835 --> 00:25:28.710
That basically means
it's just sitting there.

00:25:28.710 --> 00:25:30.860
It's not doing anything,
but just moving in time,

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.470
as we all are doing.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.770
One time I remember my wife
saying about our daughter--

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:37.700
she's like, she's
growing up so fast.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.130
I was like, eh, she's growing
up at 1 second per second.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.180
And that's just
the way things go.

00:25:42.180 --> 00:25:44.180
It's just sitting there
and it's living its life

00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:47.360
at 1 second per
second, as we all do.

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.980
That is density.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:51.350
So we described the
flux of a thing in time

00:25:51.350 --> 00:25:52.460
as just being its density.

00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:55.220
That's another way-- when we
do a lot of our calculations,

00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.057
and we talk about
the flow of things

00:25:57.057 --> 00:25:58.640
in the timelike
direction-- that tends

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:03.273
to be just the simple density
associated with stuff.

00:26:03.273 --> 00:26:04.940
And then if I did
this-- if I pulled out

00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:08.015
the x direction of this thing,
I would pull out the x component

00:26:08.015 --> 00:26:09.022
of velocity times that.

00:26:09.022 --> 00:26:11.480
And that's sort of the flux of
something in the x direction

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.170
like you are probably used
to from other classes.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:17.190
Now, a place where
this turns out--

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.720
so doing it when I'm just
using the basis 1-forms

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:33.910
is kind of trivial,
[INAUDIBLE] sucks.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.630
More generally,
what you can do is

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:53.220
define a surface as being
the solution of some scalar

00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:55.519
function in spacetime.

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:14.390
So let's say I do something
like psi of t comma x comma y

00:27:14.390 --> 00:27:17.010
equals a constant.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:17.510
OK.

00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:20.390
This is very abstract, so let me
just make it a little bit more

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:21.260
concrete.

00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:25.790
Suppose my function
psi were square root

00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.980
of x squared plus y
squared plus z squared,

00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:33.060
and my constant was 5.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:33.560
OK.

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:35.518
Well then, my scalar
field would be picking out

00:27:35.518 --> 00:27:37.080
a sphere of radius 5.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:37.580
OK.

00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.870
You can make a little bit
more complicated than that,

00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:41.080
and people often do.

00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.620
You can define the unit
1-form that is associated

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.870
with the normal to this thing.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.780
Or rather, it's the 1-form
associated with the surface.

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.527
If you translate
this to a vector--

00:27:59.527 --> 00:28:01.110
you raise the index--
with the vector,

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:02.985
it would be the vector
normal to the surface.

00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.980
You might need to normalize it.

00:28:12.980 --> 00:28:15.950
Let's imagine that we
normalize this thing.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:23.990
And then we would just need
to contract it along this,

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:26.120
and that tells me
about the flux through

00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:27.280
this particular surface.

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:27.780
OK?

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.540
This is one of the
things that-- this idea

00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:34.915
of 1-forms being
level surfaces--

00:28:34.915 --> 00:28:36.707
it tends to be useful
for things like that.

00:28:36.707 --> 00:28:38.915
We're going to come back to
a similar sort of picture

00:28:38.915 --> 00:28:40.790
in just a moment, because
we'll have to start

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:41.965
talking about integration.

00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.610
OK.

00:28:50.610 --> 00:28:55.220
In prep for that
discussion, now that I'm

00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:56.810
talking about
things a little bit

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:05.330
more complicated than just the
kinematics of simple particles,

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.930
we're going to want
to have some laws.

00:29:08.930 --> 00:29:11.900
And we want to have
geometric ways of describing

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.100
those laws that essentially
act as constraints

00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.700
on what those particles can do.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:19.200
OK.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.550
So the form in which we're
going to express them-- we're

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:24.175
going to tend to put things into
the form of conservation laws.

00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:41.772
So suppose, here's my little
element that's got dust in it,

00:29:41.772 --> 00:29:43.230
and it's embedded
in an environment

00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:44.940
with a bunch of dust around it.

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:47.610
And over some time interval,
some dust flows in,

00:29:47.610 --> 00:29:49.132
some does flows out.

00:29:49.132 --> 00:29:51.090
The density can go up,
the density can go down.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.333
The total number--
it may vary depending

00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:54.375
on how things are flying.

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:10.000
The spatial flux out of
the sides must come--

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.750
and I'm going to say
it's the flux out--

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:22.820
so let's say that that comes
at the expense of the density

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:23.860
of dust already there.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:28.640
OK.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:30.348
And so if you were to
just to intuitively

00:30:30.348 --> 00:30:32.210
write down what kind
of conservation law

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:36.440
you would expect to see, you
would write it as something

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.487
like this, based on simple
Euclidean intuition.

00:30:42.683 --> 00:30:44.850
What's kind of nice-- you
look at that for a second.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:48.400
You go, ooh, if I think
about this as being the time

00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.980
complement of my 4-vector.

00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:53.370
This is the space
component of my 4-vector.

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.490
This has a very obvious
form when I write it

00:30:56.490 --> 00:30:59.280
in a geometric framework.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:05.230
This whole thing can be
rewritten as a conservation

00:31:05.230 --> 00:31:07.570
law that looks like this.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:09.750
OK.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:18.460
So I'll remind you, d sub
alpha equals d by dx alpha.

00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.240
I'm going to talk a little bit
about some of the derivatives

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.250
a little bit later, because
there are a few subtle points

00:31:23.250 --> 00:31:24.250
that can get introduced.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.090
But for now, we just
know that d downstairs

00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:31.380
t is d by dt. d downstairs x
is d by dx. d by downstairs y,

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:31.880
et cetera.

00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:35.950
So this is really nice.

00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:37.783
One thing which I want
to emphasize-- again,

00:31:37.783 --> 00:31:41.280
coming back to what I said
over there just a moment ago.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:44.070
When I write down
this conservation law,

00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:46.620
I'm assuming that
someone has defined

00:31:46.620 --> 00:31:50.520
what time means and someone
has defined what space means.

00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.100
This is a form that's
covariant, right?

00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.560
All observers agree
that this goes together.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.938
When they actually make
their own coordinate systems,

00:31:57.938 --> 00:32:00.480
they're going to have their own
time coordinate and their own

00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:03.540
x-coordinate, but they're all
going to be different flavors--

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.910
just different ways of
instantiating what this is.

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:15.860
Now, pardon me for
just one moment.

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.855
Depending on the
pace of the course,

00:32:20.855 --> 00:32:23.480
we're about to switch over to a
different set of lecture notes,

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:24.620
and I want to make
sure I smoothly

00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.700
go from one to the other.

00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:26.660
OK.

00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.050
So in many of your physics
classes, you have learned,

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.960
when you get a conservation
law, both a differential

00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.160
form like this--

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.490
the rate of change of N in a box
is related to the amount of N

00:32:37.490 --> 00:32:39.740
flowing out of that
box and its sides.

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:42.290
And you also learn an integral
form of the conservation law.

00:33:08.790 --> 00:33:11.760
So without proof,
let me just say

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.610
that it should be
intuitively clear

00:33:14.610 --> 00:33:17.640
that what I've written down
over here is equivalent to--

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.457
OK, so it looks like this.

00:33:45.457 --> 00:33:46.040
You know what?

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:48.922
Let me just fix up my
notation a little bit.

00:33:48.922 --> 00:33:50.130
Let me call this lowercase n.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.140
OK.

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.890
A few symbols that
I've introduced here--

00:33:59.890 --> 00:34:10.090
so V3 is some volume in
three-dimensional space,

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:12.760
and dV like this--
this is a symbol

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:15.760
that means the boundary
of that 3-volume.

00:34:29.915 --> 00:34:32.130
And that's basically--
it's a form of Gauss's law.

00:34:32.130 --> 00:34:33.080
That's what I've
written down there.

00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:33.580
OK?

00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:35.409
So you've all seen
things like that.

00:34:35.409 --> 00:34:38.199
Again, let me emphasize
that when I write down

00:34:38.199 --> 00:34:42.400
a formula like that, I can
only do that having assumed

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.320
a particular Lorentz frame.

00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.770
That t is the t
of some observer.

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:50.650
That volume is the volume
of that particular observer

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:52.179
who is using t.

00:34:52.179 --> 00:34:54.389
You jump into a
different Lorentz frame,

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:55.855
their volumes will
not be the same.

00:34:55.855 --> 00:34:57.230
Their times will
not be the same.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:34:58.813
I'm going to make
some coordinates up.

00:34:58.813 --> 00:35:02.230
So an integral form like this,
as I've written it there, only

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:04.870
works in one given
Lorentz frame.

00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:07.722
Nonetheless, we are
going to find it useful,

00:35:07.722 --> 00:35:09.430
even though in some
sense, when you do it

00:35:09.430 --> 00:35:11.650
in an integral form
like this, you're

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:14.928
saying things in the framework
of some particular observer.

00:35:14.928 --> 00:35:16.720
Sometimes you want to
know in the framework

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.887
of some particular observer.

00:35:17.887 --> 00:35:18.890
It could be you, right?

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.310
And you might care about
these sorts of things.

00:35:21.310 --> 00:35:25.090
And that's good, but the
way I've written it here--

00:35:25.090 --> 00:35:29.373
first of all, it's
in language that--

00:35:29.373 --> 00:35:30.790
it's in a mathematical
formulation

00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:32.832
that's not easy to generalize
as I take things up

00:35:32.832 --> 00:35:34.790
to higher dimensions.

00:35:34.790 --> 00:35:37.360
And so what I
would like to do is

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:42.610
think about how to step
up a formulation like this

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:49.080
in such a way that things are
put into as frame-independent

00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:52.863
a language as is possible, and
that will generalize forward

00:35:52.863 --> 00:35:55.030
when we start looking at
more complicated geometries

00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:58.430
than just geometry of
special relativity.

00:35:58.430 --> 00:36:00.310
So I want to spend
the next roughly 10

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:05.780
or 15 minutes talking about
volumes and volume integrals.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.600
And my goal here is to try to--

00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.600
I'm going to start by
just doing stuff that

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:14.860
comes from the journal of duh.

00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:17.240
It's stuff you have seen
over and over and over again,

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:22.090
but I want to re-express it
using mathematical formulation

00:36:22.090 --> 00:36:24.190
that maybe--

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.330
you have seen all the
symbols, but perhaps not used

00:36:26.330 --> 00:36:28.180
in quite this way.

00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:31.420
And then it'll carry forward
in a framework that generalizes

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.590
in a very useful way for us.

00:36:33.590 --> 00:36:38.960
So let's begin with
just simple 3D space.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.150
So I'm going to
begin in 3D, and I'm

00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:50.580
going to consider
a parallelepiped--

00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:52.786
parallelepiped.

00:36:52.786 --> 00:36:53.286
Ha-ha.

00:36:53.286 --> 00:36:58.905
Got it right-- whose sides
are a set of vectors.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:07.150
So there are three
vectors, A, B, and C. OK.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.890
So here is a vector A. This
one going into the board

00:37:18.890 --> 00:37:23.790
is vector B. And this one
going up here is vector C. OK.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.040
So those are my three vectors.

00:37:26.040 --> 00:37:30.600
And if I go draw the ghost legs
associated with these things--

00:37:35.330 --> 00:37:35.830
OK.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:41.050
That's a little bit better.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:44.340
So these three vectors
define a particular volume.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.080
And you guys have
probably all seen--

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.040
you know you have three vectors.

00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:48.915
You can define a volume
associated with this.

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.130
A really easy way
to get that volume

00:37:54.130 --> 00:37:56.390
given those three
vectors is to take A

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:03.460
and dot it into the
cross product of B and C.

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:07.310
This is a quantity which is
cyclic, so if you prefer,

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:13.720
you can write it as B
dotted into C cross A,

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:26.160
or C dotted into A cross B.

00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.730
That can be expressed
as a determinant, or--

00:38:33.873 --> 00:38:36.540
you guys can look at my notes to
see the determinant written out

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:38.332
if you like, but it's
not that interesting,

00:38:38.332 --> 00:38:41.750
so I'm not going to
use it very much.

00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:43.920
An equivalent way
of writing all that

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:46.110
is to use the
Levi-Civita symbol.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:18.780
So that 3-volume is given by
epsilon ijk Ai Bj Ck, where--

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:29.940
I'll remind you-- epsilon ijk
equals plus 1 if i equals 1,

00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:38.600
j equals 2, k equals 3,
and even permutations.

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.730
Even permutations means I
swap two pairs of indices.

00:39:45.730 --> 00:39:50.090
So 123, 231, 312--

00:39:50.090 --> 00:39:51.260
those all give me plus 1.

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:58.280
It gives me minus 1 for any
odd permutations of those.

00:40:04.230 --> 00:40:08.940
So 132, 231, et cetera.

00:40:08.940 --> 00:40:11.700
Those will all give me minus 1.

00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:14.280
And it's 0 if any
index is repeated.

00:40:28.410 --> 00:40:30.660
So you probably have all
seen things like this before.

00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:32.575
This is fairly basic
vector geometry.

00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:39.850
We are going to regard
the Levi-Civita symbol

00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:44.140
as the components
of a 0, 3 tensor.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:49.540
OK.

00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:52.000
Bear in mind for just a
moment here I'm working only

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.460
in-- sorry, just ran
out of good chalk--

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:58.240
I'm only working in 3-space,
so my tensor definition

00:40:58.240 --> 00:40:59.260
is slightly different.

00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:01.990
It's not going to be a set of
things that maps to Lorentz

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:04.360
invariants, but it's going
to be invariant with respect

00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:06.280
to things like rotations
and translations

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:08.960
in three-dimensional space.

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:22.160
So I'm going to regard these
as the components of a 0, 3

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:29.180
tensor that basically
takes in vectors and spits

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:35.180
out the volume associated with
the element whose edges are

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:36.350
bounded by those vectors.

00:42:03.090 --> 00:42:03.880
OK.

00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:09.650
So I could say, in this abstract
form I wrote down earlier,

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.740
imagine a boldfaced epsilon
which is my volume tensor.

00:42:16.410 --> 00:42:19.880
I put these slots
into it, and voila.

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.550
I get the volume out of it.

00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:28.520
Now, with that in mind,
remember some of the games

00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:32.340
that we played with tensors
in the previous lecture.

00:42:32.340 --> 00:42:36.050
So when I was talking
about spacetime tensors,

00:42:36.050 --> 00:42:41.240
if I filled up all
of their slots,

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:42.890
I got out a Lorentz
invariant number.

00:42:42.890 --> 00:42:45.265
In this case, I'm in 3-space,
so I fill up all its slots,

00:42:45.265 --> 00:42:48.530
I get an invariant
number in this 3-space.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:50.180
Suppose I only put
in two vectors.

00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:04.200
So suppose I do something
like, I plug in--

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.920
let's leave the
first slot blank--

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:12.650
and I put in vectors
B and C. OK, well,

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:16.070
writing this out
in component form,

00:43:16.070 --> 00:43:21.800
I know this is
epsilon ijk Bj Ck.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:25.200
That's just B cross C, right?

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.130
That's the area spanned
by the side that

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.220
is B cross C. And you guys
have learned in other classes

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.000
that you have an
extra index left over,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.840
so it's a vector that has a
direction associated to it.

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:38.810
So it's sort of an
oriented surface.

00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:40.798
We put the index in the
downstairs position,

00:43:40.798 --> 00:43:42.590
so we're actually going
to think about this

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:47.180
as a 1-form corresponding
to the side whose

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:54.200
edges are B and C. So let's
call this side 1-form sigma.

00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:15.060
This is a 1-form whose magnitude
is the area of the side spanned

00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:20.400
by the vectors B and C.

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:24.300
And although I can still tell
it hasn't quite gelled yet,

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:26.580
it's useful to think
of 1-forms as being

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.530
associated with surfaces.

00:44:28.530 --> 00:44:29.030
Guess what?

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:30.750
This is the side of
a parallelepiped.

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:32.730
That's a surface.

00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.500
So it actually holds together.

00:44:39.350 --> 00:44:40.460
All right.

00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:50.050
So using all of this, if
I wanted to write down

00:44:50.050 --> 00:45:31.133
how to do something like
Gauss's theorem in this kind

00:45:31.133 --> 00:45:33.300
of geometric language-- and
again, we emphasize this

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.290
is very much in the spirit
right now of mosquito

00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:38.280
with a sledgehammer.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:39.610
We don't need all
this sort of stuff,

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:41.235
but we're about to
step up to something

00:45:41.235 --> 00:45:42.640
a little bit more complicated.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:46.960
So what you would do is say, OK,
well, I know Gauss's theorem.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:50.190
I pick a particular 3-volume.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:52.560
I say the divergence of
some vector field integrated

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:56.520
over that volume is
given by integrating

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.560
the flux of that vector over
the surface of this thing.

00:46:03.005 --> 00:46:04.380
So what you might
want to do then

00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:06.780
at this point is say, oh, OK,
well, what I'm going to do,

00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.460
then, is say that my volume--

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:11.130
oops, pardon me a second.

00:46:11.130 --> 00:46:16.070
First thing I'll do is
define a differential triple.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:27.440
I'll define some x1 that
points along one direction

00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:33.800
I care about, and x2, and an x3.

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:47.510
And then I will say dV equals
epsilon ijk dx1i dx2j dx3k.

00:46:47.510 --> 00:46:50.630
I can likewise define
a 1-form associated

00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:52.970
with my area element, as
I have done over here.

00:47:00.082 --> 00:47:01.790
I'm not going to
actually write this out.

00:47:01.790 --> 00:47:02.720
The key thing
which I want to say

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.887
is you have all the pieces--

00:47:03.887 --> 00:47:07.040
you put all these
things together,

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.690
and you can define this thing.

00:47:08.690 --> 00:47:11.820
It's now very easy for you to
prove Gauss's theorem using

00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.970
this kind of ingredients.

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:15.740
What I want to move onto--

00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:17.520
there's a few more
details in my notes.

00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.720
It's not super difficult or
interesting to go through this.

00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:24.380
What I want to now start
doing is generalize

00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.080
all of these ideas
to the way we're

00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.450
going to approach
them in spacetime.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.210
Basically, we're going to
do exactly the same kind

00:47:52.210 --> 00:47:54.130
of operations that I
just did in space--

00:47:54.130 --> 00:47:55.810
three-dimensional space--

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:57.760
but I'm going to put an
extra index on things,

00:47:57.760 --> 00:48:01.130
and I'm going to do all of
my quantities in spacetime.

00:48:01.130 --> 00:48:01.630
OK.

00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:22.260
So imagine a parallelepiped
with sides A, B, C,

00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:27.810
and D. Four dimensions, so
it's going to point along four

00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:30.022
different-- these can
be mutually orthogonal.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:36.240
I'm going to define the
invariant 4-volume associated

00:48:36.240 --> 00:48:49.180
with these things like so.

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.150
Where now my four-index
Levi-Civita is defined such

00:48:53.150 --> 00:49:02.030
that epsilon 0123 equals plus 1.

00:49:02.030 --> 00:49:03.770
If I do an odd
permutation of those--

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:07.450
I exchange one pair of
them-- epsilon 1023--

00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:09.110
this equals minus 1.

00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:11.600
If I repeat any index, I get 0.

00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:18.580
And likewise, all even
permutations of this

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.300
give me plus 1.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:22.630
All odd permutations of
this give me minus 1.

00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:27.400
Or likewise, just do even
permutations of this one.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.500
So that is how I'm
going to generalize

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:31.875
my Levi-Civita symbol.

00:49:31.875 --> 00:49:33.250
As they say on
The Simpsons, it's

00:49:33.250 --> 00:49:34.840
a perfectly cromulent object.

00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:44.600
I'm going to need to talk
about the area associated

00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.100
with the faces of
each of these things.

00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.975
So what is the area of
the face of a 4-volume?

00:49:50.975 --> 00:49:52.469
A 3-volume.

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:36.580
So you can define a 1-form
that tells me about the--

00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.880
you can either call it the
3-volume or the 4-area.

00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.965
Knock yourselves out as to
how you want to call it.

00:50:41.965 --> 00:50:44.400
And the obvious
generalization-- let's

00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:52.590
say I leave off edge A. I want
to get something like this.

00:50:52.590 --> 00:50:56.340
I do my similar exercise of
defining a-- in this case,

00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.320
it'll be a differential quartet
associated with directions 0,

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:01.610
1, 2, and 3.

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:05.250
And so by going through a
procedure very similar to this,

00:51:05.250 --> 00:51:07.440
you get a generalization
of Gauss's theorem.

00:51:18.894 --> 00:51:28.710
It says that if I integrate
the spacetime divergence

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:38.680
of some 4-vector over a
four-dimensional volume,

00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:44.590
it looks like what
I get when I sum up

00:51:44.590 --> 00:51:50.730
the flux of that guy over
all of the little faces.

00:51:55.275 --> 00:51:57.400
So I'm not going to step
through the proof of that.

00:51:57.400 --> 00:52:01.360
It's fairly elementary,
and basically it's

00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:05.590
just like proofs of Gauss's law
that you have seen elsewhere,

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.750
but there's an extra
dimension attached to it.

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:10.180
Really nothing new
that's going on here.

00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:12.910
The thing which is
new is, this is now

00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:15.880
being done in an
additional dimension,

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.710
and where this
tends to be useful

00:52:17.710 --> 00:52:20.530
is when there is some
kind of a conservation law

00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:23.650
that tells you something about
this left-hand side here.

00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:32.120
So the whole starting
point of this discussion

00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:36.800
was I wrote down, on
intuitive grounds,

00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:43.450
that the rate of change of
the total amount of-- so

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:47.060
what I did was I had an
integral of dust density

00:52:47.060 --> 00:52:49.580
over a 3-volume, and I
said, d by dt of that

00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:52.250
was balanced by the flux
through the surfaces

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:53.540
on the edge of that 3-volume.

00:52:56.420 --> 00:52:58.760
As I argued, that's an
observer-dependent statement,

00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.660
because you have chosen
a particular time.

00:53:00.660 --> 00:53:03.035
You have chosen a particular
space to make those volumes.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.550
This, on the other hand--

00:53:07.550 --> 00:53:11.630
so let's switch my
general vector field

00:53:11.630 --> 00:53:15.460
V to be N that we started
this discussion off with.

00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:24.370
So this guy-- oops.

00:53:24.370 --> 00:53:26.660
Let me write it the way
I wrote it over there.

00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.727
d4x over some 4-volume.

00:53:32.310 --> 00:53:35.440
This must be 0,
because we are going

00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.230
to require that this thing be--

00:53:37.230 --> 00:53:41.730
so if my number density is
conserved, this must be 0.

00:53:48.110 --> 00:53:56.170
So this tells me that when
I do this flux integral,

00:53:56.170 --> 00:53:57.760
it's going to have to be 0.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:54:00.550
Let me now break this
integral up, and actually

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:04.630
write this into a form that
is a little closer to the way

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:06.970
that you may have seen
something like this before.

00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:21.690
So what I want to do is
actually zoom in and think

00:54:21.690 --> 00:54:23.220
about the
four-dimensional volume

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.445
that I'm doing
this integral over.

00:54:25.445 --> 00:54:27.570
So I'm just going to do a
two-dimensional cut of it

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:28.770
here on the blackboard.

00:54:28.770 --> 00:54:32.310
Let's let the time
axis go up, and let's

00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:36.210
define the edges of my
volumes to be t1 and t2.

00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:38.820
x-axis going across here.

00:54:38.820 --> 00:54:40.365
Boundaries are x1 and x2.

00:54:56.330 --> 00:54:57.090
OK.

00:54:57.090 --> 00:55:00.520
So here is my V4.

00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:14.060
And every face here is an
example of my boundary of d4.

00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:14.560
OK.

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:19.560
Of course there's one over
here as well, and over here.

00:55:22.138 --> 00:55:23.680
So if I were to do
the top line here,

00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:25.170
I know that's got
to get me 0, so I'm

00:55:25.170 --> 00:55:27.295
going to take advantage of
this and say, let's just

00:55:27.295 --> 00:55:29.110
look at what happens
when I do the integral

00:55:29.110 --> 00:55:34.690
of the flux of this thing
across the many different faces.

00:55:34.690 --> 00:55:38.520
So in a four-dimensional
parallelepiped--

00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.590
an n-dimensional
parallelepiped has 2n phases,

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:43.730
so there will be eight
integrals we need to do.

00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:44.700
They're pretty obvious
though, so I'm just

00:55:44.700 --> 00:55:46.283
going to write down
a handful of them.

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.490
OK.

00:56:08.490 --> 00:56:15.160
So over all those faces--

00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:18.300
N alpha sigma alpha.

00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.980
So what I'm going to
do now is say, OK,

00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:27.560
let's evaluate this on the
face that is at t equals t2.

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:34.220
So when I do this, I'm
going to get N0 dx dy dz.

00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:40.610
Let's do next the
contribution at moment--

00:56:40.610 --> 00:56:42.360
actually, let me move
this over, because I

00:56:42.360 --> 00:56:43.527
want a little bit more room.

00:56:56.830 --> 00:56:59.680
I also do one on the
slice t equals t1.

00:57:06.190 --> 00:57:08.680
When I do this,
though, in the same way

00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:13.030
that when you guys do fluxes
in three-dimensional space,

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:16.060
you get a sign associated
with the orientation

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:19.180
of these things, because
the Levi-Civita symbol here

00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:23.050
has sort of a right-hand
rule built into it.

00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:25.510
And so when I do it
for the side that

00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:28.090
is on the future
side of the box,

00:57:28.090 --> 00:57:29.740
I'm going to get a plus sign.

00:57:29.740 --> 00:57:32.830
Do all the analysis
carefully on the side

00:57:32.830 --> 00:57:35.580
that's on the past side the
box, you get a minus sign.

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:41.870
Then I'm going to do it--

00:57:41.870 --> 00:57:46.710
I'll pick out the
component N1, and I'm

00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:49.170
going to do this along the
face that's at x equals x1.

00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:56.560
Sorry.

00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.518
This is going to be x2.

00:58:09.090 --> 00:58:09.890
OK.

00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:12.470
You can write down
four other integrals

00:58:12.470 --> 00:58:15.560
according to when you do
the y side and the z side

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.490
that I've not drawn.

00:58:36.908 --> 00:58:37.430
OK.

00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:40.680
What I'm going to
do now is imagine

00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:44.590
that this box gets very small
in the timelike direction.

00:58:44.590 --> 00:58:55.470
So let's let t2
go to t1 plus dt.

00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:57.480
And I'm going to do
this and then rearrange

00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:58.313
things a little bit.

00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:06.820
Again, apologies.

00:59:06.820 --> 00:59:07.737
I'm eating chalk here.

00:59:14.790 --> 00:59:16.440
So I'm going to
rearrange this integral

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.610
so that it's of the form--

00:59:18.610 --> 00:59:21.500
this side's being
evaluated at t1 plus t2.

00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:44.860
So I'm going to rearrange stuff
so that I can then write--

00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:45.760
just one moment.

00:59:54.990 --> 00:59:55.490
Oh.

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:01.890
Apologies.

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:05.162
This whole thing,
of course, equals 0.

01:00:05.162 --> 01:00:06.870
I'm just looking over
my notes and went--

01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:12.580
there was a magic sign flip.

01:00:12.580 --> 01:00:13.580
I was just looking at
it and going, where

01:00:13.580 --> 01:00:14.820
the hell did that come from?

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:15.320
OK.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:17.190
So I left off my equals 0 there.

01:00:17.190 --> 01:00:20.900
I'm basically moving a bunch
of terms to the other side.

01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:24.640
So now I'm integrating
this over the face at x2.

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:34.725
And I do an integral
over the face at x1.

01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:40.510
And then I'm not drawing
in a bunch of faces

01:00:40.510 --> 01:00:43.390
along y2 and y1, z1 and z2.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:50.030
Divide both sides by dt.

01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:53.180
Take the limit of dt going to 0.

01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.230
What is this?

01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:57.900
This is the derivative of
the volume integral of N0.

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:28.150
So let's just write
that out explicitly.

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:39.390
So if I've got integral
t1 plus dt N0 dx dy dz

01:01:39.390 --> 01:01:41.295
minus the integral at t1--

01:01:46.570 --> 01:01:49.780
all this divided by dt.

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.640
Take the limit as dt goes to 0.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.200
That becomes this.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:04.400
That i is a bad erasure.

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.430
My apologies.

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:12.510
What do I get for
the other term?

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:16.230
Well, when I divide
out that dt, I

01:02:16.230 --> 01:02:21.780
am just left with the flux
of the spatial component

01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:29.280
of the number vector N through
all six sides at moment t,

01:02:29.280 --> 01:02:29.910
or t1.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:58.060
And at last-- so I will wrap
things up in just a moment

01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.380
here.

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:04.450
What this finally leads us to
is that this fully covariant

01:03:04.450 --> 01:03:06.340
form that I have
at the top there--

01:03:16.890 --> 01:03:44.253
this becomes-- so
in the language

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:46.420
that you probably learned
about in an earlier class,

01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.700
you can think of this as the
area element of each side.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:52.450
These are completely
equivalent to one another

01:03:52.450 --> 01:03:55.090
after you have chosen a
particular Lorentz frame

01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:57.370
and invoked this
four-dimensional analog

01:03:57.370 --> 01:03:58.240
of Gauss's law.

01:04:18.070 --> 01:04:21.740
So that was a lot to take,
but I wanted to do it

01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:24.230
for this one particularly--

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:27.170
to be blunt, this was a
particularly simple example,

01:04:27.170 --> 01:04:28.580
because--

01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.380
so right now, the
only matter that I've

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:33.350
introduced beyond particle
kinematics is dust.

01:04:33.350 --> 01:04:35.900
And dust is actually
surprisingly important.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.580
When we actually
get to cosmology,

01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:41.120
there are essentially
two forms of matter

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:44.240
that we consider when we study
cosmology, and one of them

01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:46.110
is dust.

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:49.460
In cosmological
situations, a dust particle

01:04:49.460 --> 01:04:52.738
is basically a galaxy, or
even a cluster of galaxies.

01:04:52.738 --> 01:04:53.530
We're thinking big.

01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.247
So it's not trivial to
do this, but we are soon

01:05:00.247 --> 01:05:02.330
going to need to introduce
mathematical tools that

01:05:02.330 --> 01:05:05.150
are a little better for
describing things like fluids,

01:05:05.150 --> 01:05:06.350
and stuff like that.

01:05:06.350 --> 01:05:08.270
And when we do
that, we are at last

01:05:08.270 --> 01:05:13.970
going to have things like
conservation of energy

01:05:13.970 --> 01:05:16.260
and conservation of momentum.

01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:20.180
It will be really
easy to write down

01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:24.230
a differential conservation
law that describes conservation

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:27.590
of both energy and momentum
using that mathematical object.

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:31.580
Via a process very similar
to what I just did here,

01:05:31.580 --> 01:05:33.890
we can then turn
this into integrals

01:05:33.890 --> 01:05:36.307
that describe how
energy is conserved

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.390
in a particular volume
where things may be flowing

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:41.930
into or flowing out of it,
and how momentum is conserved

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:44.810
per unit volume as things flow
into it and flow out of it.

01:05:44.810 --> 01:05:46.580
I'm not going to go
through that in detail

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:49.540
on the board, but
having done this--

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:52.040
I have some notes that I'm going
to post to the website that

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:56.950
describe this, and that will
be the way we communicate this.

01:05:56.950 --> 01:05:58.950
And we're going to take
advantage-- to be blunt,

01:05:58.950 --> 01:06:00.908
we will mostly just use
this differential form.

01:06:00.908 --> 01:06:03.650
We'll use the fact there is a
particular mathematical object

01:06:03.650 --> 01:06:07.560
whose divergence-like
derivative there is equal to 0.

01:06:07.560 --> 01:06:08.060
OK.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.970
We have a few minutes left and
we've ended early a few times,

01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:12.512
so I'd like to take
advantage of this

01:06:12.512 --> 01:06:14.450
to switch gears a
little bit and talk

01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:19.160
about another
important 4-vector that

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.920
plays some role in physics,
and allows me to introduce

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:26.197
a few other very useful
tricks that we will often

01:06:26.197 --> 01:06:28.280
take advantage of at various
points in this class.

01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:35.110
I forgot there's a straw.

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:37.180
When you tip it, the
straw doesn't work.

01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:41.970
Anyway, so the next
example of stuff

01:06:41.970 --> 01:06:46.140
that we will occasionally talk
about is an electric current.

01:06:56.220 --> 01:06:59.090
So switching gears
very, very much now.

01:07:20.770 --> 01:07:24.680
So we will describe
this as a 4-vector whose

01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:28.130
timelike component is the
charge density as seen

01:07:28.130 --> 01:07:32.420
by some observer, and
whose spatial component

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:34.940
is the current density
as seen by that observer.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:36.470
Bear in mind, you
might look at this

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:38.690
and twitch a little bit
because the units look wrong.

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:41.180
Don't forget c equals 1.

01:07:41.180 --> 01:07:43.280
So if you use this in
other systems of units,

01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:48.320
sometimes we call this component
charge density times c.

01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:52.322
So you guys have all--

01:07:52.322 --> 01:07:54.530
you know what, let me just
go ahead and write it out.

01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:57.080
So a couple
properties about this

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.730
are important and interesting.

01:07:58.730 --> 01:08:03.080
One is that the current
and the charge density

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.130
obey a continuity equation.

01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:15.600
We can think of it as a
conservation of charge.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:21.198
It's expressed-- so
in elementary E&M,

01:08:21.198 --> 01:08:23.490
you guys all presumably
learned that the rate of change

01:08:23.490 --> 01:08:25.380
of charge density is
related to the divergence

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.338
of the current density.

01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:33.260
Well, this is exactly
the same as saying

01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:37.640
that the spacetime divergence
of the current 4-vector

01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:40.149
is equal to 0.

01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:42.819
This is really useful for us.

01:08:42.819 --> 01:08:45.370
And indeed, bearing
this in mind,

01:08:45.370 --> 01:08:48.729
we find that if we want to
express Maxwell's equations

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:51.729
in a covariant way, we
can do so such that this

01:08:51.729 --> 01:08:55.229
is built in automatically.

01:08:55.229 --> 01:09:04.389
So skipping over a few
sets of things in my notes,

01:09:04.389 --> 01:09:05.264
we're going to find--

01:09:08.250 --> 01:09:09.250
we're not going to find.

01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:14.590
We have found that electric
fields and magnetic fields

01:09:14.590 --> 01:09:19.270
are inconvenient
objects to describe

01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:22.750
using geometric objects that
are appropriate for spacetime.

01:09:22.750 --> 01:09:24.130
If I want a
geometric object that

01:09:24.130 --> 01:09:27.250
is appropriate for spacetime,
the first thing you think of

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:30.130
is a 4-vector.

01:09:30.130 --> 01:09:33.420
A 4-vector has four components.

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:34.899
E-fields and
B-fields have a total

01:09:34.899 --> 01:09:36.790
of six components among them.

01:09:36.790 --> 01:09:40.479
So what you going to do, have
two 4-vectors and just ignore

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:42.430
two of the components?

01:09:42.430 --> 01:09:43.896
That seems sketchy.

01:09:43.896 --> 01:09:45.229
So you think, eh, you know what?

01:09:45.229 --> 01:09:47.200
Why don't we make a tensor.

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:49.930
Ah crap, a tensor
has 16 components.

01:09:49.930 --> 01:09:50.930
That doesn't seem right.

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:53.060
Then you go, ooh, I
can make it symmetric.

01:09:53.060 --> 01:10:06.310
If you have a symmetric
4-by-4 tensor,

01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:08.130
well, that basically
means that the number

01:10:08.130 --> 01:10:10.470
of independent numbers that
go into this thing-- you

01:10:10.470 --> 01:10:13.340
have four down the diagonal.

01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:15.090
And then you count the
number that are off

01:10:15.090 --> 01:10:16.700
the diagonal-- you have six.

01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:19.200
There's 16 in total, but the
ones that are off the diagonal

01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:26.140
are equal to one another, so you
have four on diagonal, six off.

01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:26.640
Too many.

01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.350
So you say, well, what
about antisymmetric?

01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:44.170
If I have an
antisymmetric object,

01:10:44.170 --> 01:10:46.020
that means that
component F alpha

01:10:46.020 --> 01:10:51.060
beta is the negative of
component F beta alpha.

01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:54.120
When you do that, that
forces you the conclusion

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:55.710
that there are,
in fact, actually

01:10:55.710 --> 01:10:58.410
only six independent
numbers in that thing.

01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:02.040
The diagonal has to be
0, because set beta equal

01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:02.970
to alpha here--

01:11:02.970 --> 01:11:05.280
F alpha alpha equals
minus F alpha alpha.

01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:07.770
That only works if that
component is equal to 0.

01:11:07.770 --> 01:11:19.420
So the diagonal becomes zero,
and only the six off-diagonals

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:19.920
survive.

01:11:25.210 --> 01:11:27.050
And then you go, holy crap.

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.740
Six.

01:11:27.740 --> 01:11:30.830
That's exactly what I need to
have a geometric object that

01:11:30.830 --> 01:11:33.620
cleanly holds the three
independent electric field

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:36.050
components and the three
independent magnetic field

01:11:36.050 --> 01:11:37.970
components.

01:11:37.970 --> 01:11:41.450
So many of you
have seen all this.

01:11:41.450 --> 01:11:43.260
If this isn't familiar
to you, take a look

01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:45.260
at a book like Griffiths
or something like that.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:46.940
It goes through this.

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:52.820
The punchline is
that what you find

01:11:52.820 --> 01:11:57.200
is that the electric and
magnetic field is very nicely

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:03.410
represented by this
antisymmetric 2-index object,

01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:07.220
whose components, in the
units that we are using,

01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:19.700
are filled with the
E and the B like so.

01:12:24.330 --> 01:12:24.830
OK.

01:12:24.830 --> 01:12:26.490
Last semester I had
these memorized,

01:12:26.490 --> 01:12:27.907
but I have totally
forgotten them.

01:12:41.650 --> 01:12:42.150
OK.

01:12:42.150 --> 01:12:45.840
So this is a geometric
object that-- whoops.

01:12:52.878 --> 01:12:54.670
Anybody know why I just
said whoops and had

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:56.450
to put a dot on that there?

01:12:56.450 --> 01:13:00.010
The point is that electric
and magnetic fields

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:01.900
look different to
different observers.

01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:04.150
This is its representation
according to one

01:13:04.150 --> 01:13:06.250
particular Lorentz observer.

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.750
So it's important
to get that right.

01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:21.810
So in terms of this--

01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:25.029
you're all familiar with the
four Maxwell's equations.

01:13:34.020 --> 01:13:36.840
They turn out to
be equivalent to--

01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:46.688
so if you take a divergence
of this F, it is--

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:48.230
depending on your
units, so you might

01:13:48.230 --> 01:13:50.840
want to put u0's in there,
and things like that.

01:13:50.840 --> 01:13:53.820
Basically, I'm
setting everything

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:56.480
that I can never remember to 1.

01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:58.230
The divergence of that
thing-- by the way,

01:13:58.230 --> 01:14:00.050
actually divergence
on the second index--

01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:02.990
becomes the current density.

01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:04.820
This will actually
only give you half

01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:07.340
of the Maxwell's equations.

01:14:07.340 --> 01:14:16.000
The other half-- what you do
is you lower these two indices,

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:24.327
and there's this cyclic
permutation of derivatives

01:14:24.327 --> 01:14:25.160
that give you these.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.020
So you put these
two things together,

01:14:27.020 --> 01:14:29.930
you apply it to this form
I've written out here,

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:31.993
and you will reproduce
Maxwell's equations

01:14:31.993 --> 01:14:33.410
as they are presented
in textbooks

01:14:33.410 --> 01:14:36.530
like Purcell and Griffiths.

01:14:36.530 --> 01:14:38.510
The thing which I
want to emphasize here

01:14:38.510 --> 01:14:44.180
is, this form that we've
got is written in such a way

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:49.680
that the conservation of
source is built into it.

01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:56.750
This geometric language requires
that J mu have no divergence.

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:58.520
And let me just show
you can do this.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:01.993
All you need to know is that
F is an antisymmetric tensor.

01:15:01.993 --> 01:15:04.160
You don't need to know
anything about the properties

01:15:04.160 --> 01:15:05.420
of the E- and the B-field.

01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.295
So let's just try it.

01:15:25.160 --> 01:15:27.720
Let's look at the
divergence of the current.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:34.760
So I'm going to
do 4pi d mu J mu.

01:15:34.760 --> 01:15:43.740
So I'm going to take a
mu derivative of this.

01:15:46.500 --> 01:15:48.980
Now bear in mind, mu and nu--

01:15:48.980 --> 01:15:50.790
I'm using Einstein's
summation convention--

01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:54.420
they are dummy indices,
so I can relabel them.

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.230
I can change them.

01:15:55.230 --> 01:15:58.590
I can change mu to an
alpha, nu to a beta,

01:15:58.590 --> 01:16:01.770
or I can just change
mu to nu, nu to mu.

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:10.240
So this-- as long as I do it
consistently on all objects

01:16:10.240 --> 01:16:13.020
that have those things--
this is the exact same thing.

01:16:20.260 --> 01:16:22.900
But I also know that this
tensor is antisymmetric.

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:35.550
So if I switch these guys
back, I get a minus sign.

01:16:35.550 --> 01:16:36.810
OK?

01:16:36.810 --> 01:16:37.830
Antisymmetry.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:49.240
What happens if I switch the
order of the derivatives?

01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:52.113
Does it matter whether I take
the x derivative first and then

01:16:52.113 --> 01:16:54.030
the y derivative, or the
y derivative and then

01:16:54.030 --> 01:16:55.740
the x derivative?

01:16:55.740 --> 01:16:58.200
Partial derivatives commute
with each other, right?

01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:00.150
They are perfectly symmetric.

01:17:00.150 --> 01:17:15.680
So this-- so what I've got
is d mu d nu of F mu nu

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.120
is minus d mu d nu of
F mu nu, and that only

01:17:20.120 --> 01:17:23.090
works if the whole thing is 0.

01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:33.860
What I just did is, I
actually just invoked a trick

01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:38.120
that we are going
to use many times.

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:41.930
And the one reason why--
this is a bit of a tangent.

01:17:41.930 --> 01:17:45.050
Or more than a tangent--

01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:47.960
150-degree turn from
what I've been discussing

01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:51.680
before-- but I wanted to make
sure you saw this little trick.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:18:04.840
Whenever I have an object that
is antisymmetric in its indices

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:07.840
and I contract it
with an object that

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:18.260
is symmetric in its
indices, you just get 0.

01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:19.850
You can go through
the little exercise

01:18:19.850 --> 01:18:22.730
if you don't feel
fluent in this yet.

01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:26.240
You can do the exercise I
just did up there again over.

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:28.580
Take advantage of dummy
indices, swap one.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:30.620
Work in the antisymmetry,
swap the other.

01:18:30.620 --> 01:18:32.360
Work in the symmetry-- boom.

01:18:32.360 --> 01:18:34.617
You will necessarily
prove that you've got 0.

01:18:34.617 --> 01:18:36.200
So I lay this out
here because there's

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:38.660
going to be several times
later in the course, where

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.648
I'm going to get to a
particular calculation

01:18:40.648 --> 01:18:42.440
and there's going to
be some godawful mess.

01:18:42.440 --> 01:18:44.150
We're going to look at it
and go, oh, this is horrible,

01:18:44.150 --> 01:18:46.490
and then go, wait,
symmetry-antisymmetry, boom.

01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:49.560
We just killed 13 terms.

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:52.170
Tricks are fun.

01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:55.660
So I am going to
stop there for today.

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:58.530
There is another
symmetry-antisymmetry thing

01:18:58.530 --> 01:19:00.240
which allows you to--

01:19:00.240 --> 01:19:02.100
if you apply it to
the equation of motion

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:04.770
of a charge in an
electromagnetic field,

01:19:04.770 --> 01:19:07.620
it just shows you that
that equation of motion

01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:11.760
builds in the fact that in
spacetime, the acceleration is

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.490
always orthogonal
to the 4-velocity.

01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:15.760
I won't do it in class.

01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:18.710
It is on page 6 of the notes
that I'm about to post up.

01:19:18.710 --> 01:19:19.950
We will pick up next time.

01:19:19.950 --> 01:19:23.510
We'll begin by talking about
the stress energy tensor.

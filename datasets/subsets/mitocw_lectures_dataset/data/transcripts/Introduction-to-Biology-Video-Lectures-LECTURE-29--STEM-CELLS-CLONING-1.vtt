WEBVTT

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Good morning, class.
Nice to see you here.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Yesterday morning I was in
Australia and today I'm here.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
And it's nice to be back.
It's a long way home.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We're talking today about the
issues of growth and differentiation

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
about normal cells becoming
specialized into different types of

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
cells throughout the body and how
that leads ultimately to the issues

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
of organismic cloning.
And, to give you an overall

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
background about this, I want
to show you the way that a

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
worm is put together. This
is the worm C. elegans.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't know how well this
overhead will come out.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You can see it reasonably well.
So, this is the worm Caenorhabditis

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
elegans. It's been an
object of much study here.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Bob Horowitz in our own
department just got the Nobel Prize

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:07.000
for his
work on this.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And the reason it's been the
object of so much study is,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
in fact, that it's a
relatively simple organism.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
It's the way that you and I looked
about 600 million years ago when

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Metazoa, remember Metazoa
means multicellular organisms,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
first arose on the face of the
planet. Let's see if I have too

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
much overlap here. Well,
that's about the way it should

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
look. Now, what's remarkable about
this organism is it has something

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
like 965 cells in the adult.
The cells all descend from a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
fertilized egg. It happens
to be that this worm is

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
a hermaphrodite.
So, you probably know

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
hermaphrodites are both male and
female and it can fertilize itself

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
or two worms can get together
and fertilize each other.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Because, as you can see, it
makes both eggs and it makes

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
sperm. And what's most interesting
is the finite number of cells in the

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
body of the adult.
As I said, it's 965,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
whose lineage can be traced through
a pedigree that's given right up

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
here. So, one can plot out,
with great precision, how all the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
cells, how the egg cell and the
fertilized egg divides in two,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
each of those cells divides again
in two and how ultimately one has a

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
whole series of different
descendents from different branches

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
of this very elaborate family tree.
Now, one of the issues that we want

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
to pursue is the fact that
the genomes, in principle,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
all the cells in this organism are
the same. That is to say whenever

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
the cell goes through a cycle of
growth and division the cell is

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
genetically identical, yet
phenotypically, yet the behavior

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
reach of these cells becomes
increasingly different.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And here you can see the
different lineage of cells.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
This organism devotes a
disproportionately large amount of

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
its anatomy to reproduction,
much more even than we do. Here,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
this is the cuticle, the outer coat.
Here's the vulva, the female organ.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
This is the male organ and a
variety of other cells types.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Here's the pharynx. And yet all
the cells in all these organisms,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
with the exception of the gametes,
remember gametes means sperm and egg

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
are genetically identical.
The gametes have only half the

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
genetic content. Everybody
else is identical,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
has a diploid genome, that is
to say two copies of each gene.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And one can trace this all out.
And this represents one of the

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
great mysteries of developmental
biology, which is to say how are

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000
cells that genetically identical to
one another genotypically identical

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
to one another, phenotypically
quite different one

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
from the other? What
makes them so different?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
In fact, this image that we have
here, which in itself represents a

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
stunning achievement, that
is being able to trace the

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
pedigree of each cell in the adult
body is very different from our own

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
lineage because, as I may
have mentioned to you in

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.000
the past, each of us goes through
ten to the sixth mitoses in a

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
lifetime, you and I. That's
ten to the sixteen cell

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
divisions. And at any one time we
have roughly three times ten to the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
thirteenth cells in our body.
So, that means, if you think about

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000
that carefully, the ratio
between these two suggests

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
there's roughly a hundred
times more here than here,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
three hundred times more It means,
roughly speaking, that our body

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
turns over roughly a hundred
times in our lifetime.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
That is to say the cells
turnover. Not all of the cells,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
but that there's a continuing
replacement of existing cells with

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
new cells. After all, if,
in fact, there were no such

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
replacement than we might, as
an adult, be formed of this many

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
cells, and we would stay with
the exact same number of cells

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
throughout our lives. But
this, in fact, is the number of

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
cell divisions. And so,
there's an enormous turnover

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000
which, right away on its surface,
independent of the fact that it's an

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
enormously large number, precludes
one from really being able

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
to draw out a pedigree like
this, prevents anyone from really

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000
understanding how each particular
cell can trace its line of decent

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
back to the fertilized egg. So,
what we really want to explore,

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000
in this lecture and the next one,
is this major puzzle that one starts

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
out with a fertilized egg. Let's
say this is a fertilized egg.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
It divides in two. It divides in
four. And through subsequent cycles

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
of growth and division we
ultimately end up with the adult.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Already at the four-cell stage,
here in a vertebrate embryo, these

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:08.000
cells have begun to take
different phenotypic paths.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
That is to say cells have begun to
commit themselves into entering into

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000
one or another differentiation
lineage. And when I say a

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
differentiating lineage, I
mean a group of cells which has

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000
already made the decision to
become blood cells, to become gut,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
to become nerve cells and so forth.
And these commitments already start

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
here at the four-cell stage, and
they continue to play themselves

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
out until one reaches a newborn,
and then thereafter one just grows

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
bigger. One other important thing
to show here is that this pedigree

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
that I showed you here is not simply
the result of exponential expansion

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
of all the cells,
because many cells,

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
during the course of development,
are actually weeded out from

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
embryonic tissue. And this
happens even in our own

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
development. For example,
here, if we look at our fingers,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
I remember now I talked about
fingers about two weeks ago and got

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000
myself into some hot water. If
we look at our fingers, you'll

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000
see here we have five fingers,
God willing, and but early in

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000
embryogenesis our hand looks
like a solid flap of tissue.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
And what happens, during the
course of vertebra development,

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
is that the tissue in between the
beginning fingers is eliminated

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:40.000
through the process of apoptosis.
Apoptosis means programmed cell

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:46.000
death. Apoptosis is equivalent to
cell suicide. And what I mean by

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
that is to say that development
involves not only the exponential

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
proliferation of cells but it
involves the selective elimination

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:04.000
of cells here in a very
obvious anatomical way.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
It sometimes can be defective,
in which case individuals are born

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
with large webs between their
fingers. And this is part of normal

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
development. And the same can
be said here. If there were no

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
apoptosis during the development of
this worm embryo then there would be

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
vastly larger numbers of cells.
We mentioned implicitly apoptosis

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
during the development of the immune
system, because recall there that

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000
bee cells, which are destine
to produce antibodies,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
if they produce inappropriate
kinds of antibodies,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000
if they produce antibodies
that are self-reactive,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
i.e., recognize some of the body's
own proteins, those cells are

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.000
eliminated by apoptosis. If
they produce defective antibody

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000
molecules, they're
eliminated by apoptosis. And,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
therefore, differentiation,
which is what we're talking about

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000
here, involves not only the
commitment of cells to a certain

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
lineage, but the purpose of
elimination of cells in certain

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
parts of the organism in order
to carve and sculpt out properly

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
shaped tissue. Again, our
fingers are one dramatic

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
example of that. It turns
out we can learn an awful

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
lot about this process by studying
one specialized adult tissue,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
which is to say the
organs of hematopoiesis.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
And they'll teach us a lot about
some of the lessons we need to learn

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
about organismic development
and differentiation.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
And when I use the
word hematopoiesis,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
the term hematopoiesis, or
the adjective hematopoietic

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
refers to the creation, the
formation of different kinds of

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
blood cells. In fact, we
know that all the cells

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
in the blood descend in the
organism from a common progenitor.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And this progenitor is called
a pluripotent stem cell.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Pluripotent means that this stem
cell, and we'll define a stem cell

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
momentarily, this stem cell is
able to create descendents which can

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.000
commit themselves in a
number of distinct directions.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000
They can differentiate in a
number of distinct directions.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000
In this case, we see all these
various kinds of white and red blood

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
cells which descend from
this pluripotent stem cell.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000
And, as a consequence, we
call it pluripotent because it

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.000
has these multiple distinct
types of differentiation lineages.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000
So, here we talk about pluripotent.
Later on I'll talk about totipotent

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
cells. Totipotent are cells
that can do everything.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Therefore, in fact,
what's a totipotent cell?

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Well, a cell in the early embryo,
including a fertilized egg is

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
totipotent in that it can direct
its descendents into all of the

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
differentiation lineages in the body.
Here we have a cell that's already

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
more limited. It's only pluripotent,
pluri in the sense of multiple

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
but not total. Totipotent
obviously means it can do

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
everything. And here we see the
different kinds of derivative white

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
blood cells that exists in the
bone marrow and in the circulation,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
and there's a whole series
of different ones of them.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
We'll talk about some of them
shortly, but we've already

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
encountered some of them up here
in the form of T cells and B cells.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
When we use the word stem cell
the essence of the definition

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:33.000
is as follows. A stem
cell is a cell that can

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.000
self-renew and it can also
have a differentiated daughter.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
So, here's the way one can diagram
a stem cell. Here's a stem cell

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.000
that has two daughter cells.
One daughter cell is exactly like

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Mom and the other daughter cell
has undertaken a program of becoming

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
differentiated. So, here
we have an asymmetric cell

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000
division on the part of
this stem cell up here.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
We'll prove later
on that these two

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.000
cells are genetically identical,
but clearly they're reading out

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
their genes in quite different ways.
This cell is absolutely the same as

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000
the mother cell. This
cell has already committed

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
itself. It's made the commitment
to differentiate in one

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
or another lineage. And
another way of noting this

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000
graphically is the following.
We can draw a picture like this,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000
as we did before, and here we'll
have a second arrow that goes around

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
like this. It loops around back on
itself, and that implies the whole

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
program of self-renewal.
Now, the whole concept of

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
self-renewal is a simple one.
If a stem cell can self-renew,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:58.000
that implies that the process of
growth and division does not deplete

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000
the pool of stem cells in the
body or in a particular tissue.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
So, let's imagine what we're looking
at here. Here we have a stem cell.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
It has one cell that is just like
Mom. This is a differentiated cell.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Once again, you can have a
growth and division. This is,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000
once again, a cell like Mom.
This is a differentiated cell and

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000
so forth. And what you notice here
in this arrangement is that the stem

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:34.000
cells perpetuate themselves.
They are self-renewing.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
And, as a consequence, the pool of
stem cells is never depleted in the

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
best of all possible worlds.
It turns out that in most of the

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
tissues of our body there is
self-renewing stem cells going on,

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
because most of the differentiated
cells in our body have a finite

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
lifetime. Not all of them but most
of them. And when I say finite,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I mean it can be measured
in a matter of days or weeks

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
or months. In the
case of the brain,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
things turnover very slowly.
Even in the case of our bones,

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
our bones actually turn over
roughly once, 10% a year.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
10% of the matter in the bone is
actually turnover in every year.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So, almost all tissues in the
body are in a process of continuing

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
self-renewal and repair. And
that self-renewal and repair is

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000
maintained by this stem cell
compartment, as is indicated here.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:32.000
This has certain kinds of
great advantages, and one of the

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:38.000
advantages is indicated by the
following. Let's imagine that we

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
draw a picture, just
for the sake of argument,

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000
of one of the most highly
proliferative tissues in the body,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000
which is to say the lining of
the colon or of the duodenum.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000
So, here we have, let me
draw it slightly differently,

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
here's the way the lining of
the small intestine looks like.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Out here are the contents
of the small intestine.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:20.000
So, let's say here
is the lumen of

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
the small intestine. And
here we have, protruding into

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
the lumen, when I talk about a lumen
I'm talking about the bore or the

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
channel of a cylindrical
or tube like organism.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So, here is the lumen of the
small intestine. Here are these

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:41.000
fingerlike projections, they're
called villi, that protrude

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
into the lumen of the small
intestine. And down here at the

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000
bottom of this are these
cavities that are called crypts,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
C-R-Y-P-T-S. These are the crypts.
Now, what's important to realize is

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
that what goes through our
intestines is not that pleasant.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
It's pretty corrosive stuff. I
probably told you this already,

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
more bacteria living in there than
we have in our entire cells in our

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
entire body. There are all
kinds of digestive juices.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
And so the cells out here at the
tips of these villi are continually

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000
exposed to all kinds of corrosive
material, including the junk that we

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
eat everyday which is flowing by
like this. And this indicates how

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
critically important it is
that we have self-renewal,

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
because the cells out here,
being continually exposed to the

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
most corrosive kinds of
influences, are rapidly damages.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
And, therefore, the cells
out here have a lifetime

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.000
of only three or four days and are
then induced to jump off the end of

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:49.000
a gangplank and commit apoptosis.
So, the cells at the tip of the

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
villis are continually jumping off
and dying. And what's happening is

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
that down here in the bottom of
the crypts we have stem cells.

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:06.000
The stem cells
are continually

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
producing progeny that
have committed themselves to

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000
differentiate.
And the progeny,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000
as you might guess from what I've
just said, are continually migrating

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:19.000
up the sides of the villis up to the
end here. And this whole migration

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
takes four or five days, and
by the time they get to the tip

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000
and have stuck their heads into
the contents of the lumen of the

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000
intestine for that period
of three or four days.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Finally, they're eliminated and
they jump off into the abyss.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000
So, there's a continuing
action going on here.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
The stem cells are continually
dividing. And what advantages does

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
this have for us? Well, it
means that cells that are

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
damaged are not allowed to hang
around for a very long period of

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
time, i.e., cells up here in
the top that are exposed to,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
for example, potential mutagenic
influences are rapidly eliminated.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Why is that good? Because the
mutagenic influences up here could

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
well create a mutant cell that,
in principle, is able to become

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000
cancerous. And
the body says,

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
well, I don't mind if that happens
because these cells up here are

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000
going to be eliminated anyhow.
They're going to be pushed off the

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000
end of the diving board or
the gangplank into the abyss,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000
so they are continually undergoing
apoptosis, not as a pathological

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000
process. As a normal process.
They're continually being pushed

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
out here. And what
that means is that the

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
cells down here, in
the bottom of the crypt,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:36.000
are actually physically protected
from the contents of the lumen of

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.000
the small intestine because some
of the cells in this crypt are

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
continually secreting a kind of
mucus in this area right here.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.000
It's called a mucin. And this
mucin here creates a physical

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
barrier, so the cells that are in
the bottom of the crypt are never

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:59.000
directly exposed to the contents
of what's flowing by in the

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.000
small intestine. And that
is extremely important

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
because, in fact, it means
that these cells down here

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000
are shielded from the mutagenic
influences of what might be present

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:15.000
in the lumen of the small intestine.
In theory, one might be able to

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:19.000
evolve cells that don't mind being
up here in the lumen of the small

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
intestine. But, in fact,
that's never been possible.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
That is to say evolution has just
said, well, we can't really evolve

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
cells that are resistant to the
corrosive influences of what happens

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.000
in the small intestine.
And, therefore,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.000
we're just going to use these cells
for a very short period of time and

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
then get rid of them.
What that also means is the

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
following. The stem cells down
here stay within that crypt.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
They don't migrate out. They
stay there in that shielded

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
site. And, in fact, if
you think all this through,

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000
it's very important to protect these
cells from becoming mutated because

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
if they do become mutated they
could become the precursors

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:02.000
of cancer cells. If these
cells become mutated out

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
here, it doesn't matter because
they're going to die anyhow.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
And so, we now have the
following kind of dynamic.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Here's the stem cell. I'll
draw it again. I'll just

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
abbreviate it stem cell. And
one of the ways by which we

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000
want to preserve the genetic
integrity of the stem cell is to

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
insure that the stem cell divides
as infrequently as possible. Why?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Because the whole process of
cell division is itself a fallible

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
process. Every time a cell grows
and divides, as we learned from the

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
cell cycle, there's the possibility
of different kinds of genetic

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
disasters happening in which case we
might end up with a mutant stem cell.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
And that mutant stem cell
could in turn, I argue,

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
become involved in creating a tumor.
So, we have the following kind of

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
arrangement. Here is the stem
cell. It has one daughter that has

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
committed herself to differentiate
and the other that remains

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
a stem cell. Well, you're
saying this enormous

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000
amount of activity must involve a
frenetic amount of cell division on

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
the part of the stem cell. But
that's not really the way it

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000
happens because this daughter cell
undergoes a series of exponential

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
divisions, I can't fit them
all on the blackboard here,

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
and might even yield a hundred
descendents which then become the

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
ultimate differentiated cell.
This daughter cell becomes one stem

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
cell. This daughter cell undergoes
these exponential expansions in a

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
process of creating a population
of cells that are called transit

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:53.000
amplifying cells.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:56.000
And at the bottom of this hierarchy,
I can't draw all hundred, there may

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000
be a hundred of these cells, ten
to the second, and these cells

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:06.000
then differentiate.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
At the bottom, the hundred
cells at the bottom,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
they go into the last
stage of differentiation.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
They become the specialized cells
that line the tips of the villis.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Now, why is there this arrangement?
Well, look at what the advantage of

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
it is. The stem cell has just
divided once, but this cell has

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
generated a hundred progeny.
And that means that the stem cell

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
doesn't have to divide that often.
The stem cell can divide once.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Every time the villis needs a
hundred new cells it needs to divide

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
only once. And, therefore,
the stem cell actually is

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
one of the most slowly dividing
cells in the entire gut because it

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
only needs to divide episodically.
Each time it divides it generates

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
this enormous array of progeny.
One other aspect of differentiation,

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
and when I talk about
differentiation here,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
I mean the acquisition by these
cells of all of the traits they need

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
to line the colon. When I
talk about differentiation in

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:12.000
the skin, I talk about the ability,
the acquisition of the cells of

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000
becoming fully competent,
fully functional skin cells.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000
The same thing with neurons in the
brain. And one additional important

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:29.000
concept I'd like to introduce is
that when cells differentiate they

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
often become post-mitotic.
Post-mitotic means that these cells

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
give up the option of ever
dividing again. In other words,

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
as they acquire more and more
specialized traits they say to

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:46.000
themselves now I'm a nerve cell,
now I'm a cell in the tip of villis

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:50.000
in the intestine,
now I'm a muscle cell,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I'm not going to divide ever again.
And this is generally true. The

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
most differentiated cells in the
body in general end up losing the

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
ability to divide. They
become post-mitotic.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000
They've exited irreversibly
from the cell cycle.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000
They can't go back in. As
you recall, we talked about

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000
cells going from G0 back into the
active G1 phase of the cell cycle.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
That's a reversible exit from the
cell cycle. Post-mitotic cells are

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
irreversibly committed
never to divide again. And,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000
again, that holds true for
almost all cells of the body.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
One exception to that is,
interesting enough, in the liver.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Because what you can do with
a mouse, or even with a human,

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000
is you can cut away a couple lobes
of the liver, major league surgery.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000
And when you do that, what happens
is that all the remaining cells of

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:52.000
the liver, and these remaining cells
in the liver are called hepatocytes,

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
these hepatocytes, which until that
time had been highly specialized

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
differentiated cells in the liver,
many of them divide, they double

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
again. And in short
order one ends up with

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000
a liver which is exactly the
same size as one had before.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000
And that's actually quite
remarkable because there are very

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
few organs in the adult human
being where that will happen.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000
There is, by the way, an
interesting puzzle here,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
and that is the following.
Let's say you cut away half the

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
liver and many of the hepatocytes,
which were already highly

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000
differentiated,
began to divide again,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
so they were not serious
post-mitotic cells,

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
they could reenter into
proliferative phase.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
How do these cells know when to
stop dividing so that they end up

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
regenerating a liver of exactly
the right size? People have been

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
looking at that for 30 or 40
years. Nobody has any idea why. Why

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
doesn't the liver when all these
cells divide become one and a half

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000
times the size of its former
diameter or half the size?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Nobody really understands that.
In any case, I just want to

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.000
indicate that there is this
dynamic between differentiation and

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
proliferative capacity, one
in opposition to the other.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Well, how much hematopoiesis is
taking place here in our bone marrow,

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:16.000
for example, where a lot
of this takes place? So,

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
here are just some interesting
numbers. There are roughly five

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000
times ten to the twelfth
red blood cells --

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:34.000
-- per liter
of blood.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
And red blood cells, you may
recall, are called erythrocytes.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Remember, it's never good to use
a short Anglo-Saxon term if you can

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000
use a long complicated Greek one.
And each of these red blood cells

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000
has roughly a lifetime of 120 days.
That is to say after it's made it

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:02.000
sits around in the blood
for roughly 120 days.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
It gets warn out. It gets
gobbled up by the cells in

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:11.000
the spleen. Much of the contents
are recycled. The pigment in our

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.000
stool comes from the
recycling of the hemoglobin,

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.000
the iron and the hemoglobin, and
we're constantly renewing that.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Well, the average human being,
let's say, has roughly ten liters of

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
blood per person.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And if you put all those numbers
together, I once calculated that the

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000
number of red blood cells that
is being generated in the body is

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
roughly ten to the tenth per
hour. And you can go through the

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
calculations if you want, it is
fine with me, but take my word

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:54.000
for it's roughly what's going on
there. Ten to the tenth per hour.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Each time I utter a word
there's probably, I don't know,

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000
ten to the seventh new red blood
cells being made in my bone marrow.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
So, this is not minor
league proliferation.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Now we begin to understand why
there are ten to the sixteenth cell

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
divisions in the lifetime
of a human being. In fact,

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
a great majority of them, to
be fair, are occurring in the

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
bone marrow and in the intestine.
And if you have an individual who's

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
being exposed to certain kinds
of chemotherapy, chemotherapy,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
as you may know, is very
toxic for dividing cells,

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.000
and the side effect toxicity of
anticancer chemotherapy is largely

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
felt, first of all, in the
bone marrow where individuals

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000
tend to become anemic. Anemic
means they have lower than

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000
normal numbers of red blood cells
and also they lose a lot of the

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
lining of the intestine which
creates all kinds of also

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
unpleasantness as well.
So, we're not talking about

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
something that happens on
rare occasion in the life

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:04.000
an individual. This is
a staggering amount of

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000
mitosis that's happening every day
of our lives. Let's go back for a

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
moment to this diagram here and
realize that when I'm talking about

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
erythrocytes, I'm only talking
about one of the branches of this

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000
multi-branch pathway.
And here we see some other

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:24.000
interesting aspects of what's going
on here, and I'll give you some

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000
proofs very shortly that this
actually is what it says it is.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It actually is organized this way.
The pluripotent stem cell is capable

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
of self-renewal, and it
can spew off daughters which

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.000
actually can go in two different
directions. Its daughter may decide

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.000
that it might become the precursor
of the lymphoid cells in the blood

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000
or it might commit itself to
becoming a myeloid precursor.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:52.000
So, that's already the
beginning of a bifurcation.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
These cells are not
yet differentiated.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
They've just made the
commitment that each of them can,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.000
in principle, become the ancestor
of highly differentiated cells.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
And these cells, we can
imagine, are transient

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
amplifying cells in the sense that
even though they're committed to

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
create progeny of one sort or
another they themselves are not yet

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
fully differentiated. Keep
in mind in the context of the

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
crypt these transient amplifying
cells are on the way to becoming

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
fully differentiated, but
only at the bottom of this

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
exponential expansion of cells do
we have cells that are fully entered

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
into a highly differentiated state.
Here we see that these two cells are

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000
also stem cells in the sense
that the can self-renew.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
They have a limited self-renewal
capacity, but they can self-renew.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
And then they begin to create
progeny which themselves can

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
undertake several distinct
alternative differentiation paths.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
So, the lymphoid cells can become
the progenitors of the T lymphocytes

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
and the B lymphocytes. And,
in fact, if you recall our

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
discussion of immunology,
there's actually several different

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
kinds of T lymphocytes
and B lymphocytes. So,

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
this pathway has further
radiations further down. Here,

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
alternatively, these are the myeloid
cells. And myeloid refers to the

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
bone marrow. And the myeloid cells
can become these kinds of cells up

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
here, eosinophils and basophils
and neutrophils and monocytes,

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
and this class of cells is largely
involved in gobbling up infectious

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
agents and as agents which are
able to defend us largely against

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000
bacterial infections.
Here's the macrophage.

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000
We talked about the macrophage.
Remember the macrophage was this

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
glutton, this pig which wandered
around our tissues and gobbled up

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000
whatever kind of material it could
find and presented it to the immune

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
system. And here are several
other of the lineages.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Here is a megakaryocytic
and this is an erythrocyte.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000
What's a megakariocyte? Well,
it has a very large nucleus.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
That's what the term implies.
And what happens to the

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
megakariocyte is it buds off little
chunks of cytoplasm lacking nuclei.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
And these little chunks of
cytoplasm become the blood platelets.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Blood platelets lack nuclei.
They're enucleate because they're

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
just little bags of material which
are sent out into the circulation.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
And, as we said also earlier in the
semester, once the platelets are in

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
the circulation they are there ready
to help should there be any kind of

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
wounding, any kind of
hemorrhaging occurring.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
And the platelets can release upon
being activated in a site of wound

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.000
coagulation factors and growth
factors for the regeneration and

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
reconstruction of wound sites.
And, finally, here are our friends

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
the erythrocytes. So, here
we have a whole sequence

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
of different kinds of
differentiation commitments which

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:59.000
are going on at an enormous rate.
How do we know that there actually

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000
is a pluripotent stem cell? What
evidence can I provide you that

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
this actually exists or it's just
a figment of my normally florid

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000
imagination? And the most
direct demonstration of that is,

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
in fact, the use of bone
marrow transplantation.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
So, when we talk about a
bone marrow transplantation,

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000
or BMT as it's called
in the trade, --

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:33.000
-- one can do a
relatively simple

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000
experiment. You can take a mouse or
even a human and you can irradiate

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.000
it rather heavily. And if
you irradiate it under the

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000
right conditions you'll actually
be able to kill off all the cells in

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:48.000
the bone marrow without killing
off the mouse or the human being.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
In fact, there are drugs you
can also use in human beings to

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
eliminate virtually all the
cells in the bone marrow.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
And then what you can do is you
can take bone marrow from another

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000
organism, from another
mouse or another human,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
and you inject it into the blood
of the irradiated mouse or human.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
And the bone marrow cells, many
of them will home to the bone

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
marrow. In other words, you're
injecting the bone marrow

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000
cells in the general circulation,
but within a couple hours they'll

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
all end up in the bone marrow,
in the space in the middle of the

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000
bone because there are many kinds
of cells which have this homing

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:29.000
capacity. They go to the
right place in the body.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:33.000
So, they can home. The
injected cells can home to bone

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.000
marrow. And then, if
things are going well,

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
these injected bone marrow cells
will begin to proliferate and they

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
will ultimately regenerate this
entire cascade of differentiation

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000
decisions, as is indicated here.
And, therefore, that individual or

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000
that mouse will actually be rescued.
Because in the absence of such a

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
rescue an individual
will rapidly die.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.000
You can't live for very long in
the absence of an active bone marrow

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
because these cells here are rapidly
depleted. They turn over with some

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000
speed. The red blood cells hang
around for 120 days we said and,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
therefore, you don't need to make
them immediately because there's a

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000
whole bunch around that
have a rather slow turnover.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
But the platelets only have a
lifetime of several days before

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:22.000
they're lost, they're turned over.
And if you don't have platelets

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
you're in very bad shape because you
start hemorrhaging all over the body

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000
because, remember, the
platelets are there to stop up

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
all the holes in the
dike to prevent bleeding.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:37.000
These cells here are very important,
the eosinophils, basophils,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:41.000
neutrophils, and even macrophages
in preventing bacterial infections.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.000
And in the absence of having these
on site one can readily succumb to

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:49.000
overwhelming infections. Keep
in mind that the reason why

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.000
we're not constantly dying from
bacterial infections is not because

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000
each of us takes an antibiotic pill
every day, it's because these cells

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
are on watch to kill any bacteria
that happen to be in the wrong place

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
in the body outside of
the lumen of the gut.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
And consequently the question is
always can one rescue a mouse or a

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000
human rapidly enough? Can
one replace its bone marrow

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:19.000
rapidly enough so that this disaster
from losing all ones bone marrow

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000
doesn't overtake one and the
organism dies before the bone marrow

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000
has had a chance to become
reconstituted, regenerated,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
reconstructed. Still how
do we know from all this

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
that, in fact, there is
a pluripotent stem cell?

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.000
If you listened to everything
I said correctly you could say,

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:43.000
well, there isn't such a thing
as a pluripotent stem cell.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
There are these other kinds of
stem cells, this one and this one,

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
or these might all be stem cells.
And when I'm injecting the bone

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
marrow of a donor animal into the
recipient, I'm injecting a whole

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000
mixture of different kinds of stem
cells here each of which then goes

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000
on and populates a specialized
compartment in the bone marrow

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:05.000
or in the blood. So how
do we know there's one

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:09.000
pluripotent stem cell? One
way to prove this is the

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.000
following. Let's say we take
the bone marrow from the donor,

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
that is the bone marrow that we're
going to inject into the irradiated

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
recipient, and we irradiate
that bone marrow very lightly,

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:28.000
not to kill the bone marrow cells
but to introduce random chromosomal

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000
breaks, a very small number of
random chromosomal breaks in the

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000
donor bone marrow. So, the
purpose now of irradiation

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
is quite different from what I said
before. Before we wanted to give a

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
heavy dose of radiation to wipe
out the recipient bone marrow.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Now we're going to just give a wee
bit of radiation to the donor bone

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:53.000
marrow. What's the purpose of that?
The purpose of that small amount of

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
radiation is to create
chromosomal abnormalities.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:03.000
So, for example, if
here are two homologous

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:09.000
chromosomes in the donor cells.
Since the radiation, the very weak

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
dose of radiation is acting
randomly it will create all kinds of

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:20.000
abnormalities including,
for example, a very specific

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:25.000
chromosomal translocation so that
what might happen after this is that

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
a whole chunk of this chromosome is
translocated over to this chromosome

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:37.000
here. This is called a
chromosomal translocation.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And now here's
the donor,

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
these are donor bone marrow cells.
And keep in mind that every donor

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000
bone marrow cell that gets a little
bit of this radiation will get its

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
own very specific randomly occurring
translocation just because radiation

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
is able to break chromosomes
and then they will rejoin in

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
unpredictable ways. What
that means is that if we take

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
the donor bone marrow and irradiate
it very lightly so that we don't

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
kill the cells but we do
induce these translocations,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:17.000
one donor cell will have this
translocation and another donor cell

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
over here will have a totally
different translocation from a

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
different chromosome also induced
randomly by these stochastic

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
processes. So the
karyotype which is the whole

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:34.000
array of chromosomes of a cell,
which can be viewed at the metaphase

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:39.000
of mitosis when all the chromosomes
condense, the karyotype of each of

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000
these donor bone marrow cells
will be messed up slightly.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:48.000
And it will have
recognizable abnormalities,

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
but they're all different,
one after the other. And after

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
we've done this, after
we've marked millions of bone

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
marrow cells in the donor with
these random low-dose radiations,

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
we can then inject a small
number of bone marrow cells into

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:11.000
the recipient. And what
we can sometimes find on

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
occasion is if we look at the
recipient after that recipient has

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:19.000
been rescued, i. ., after
the donor bone marrow has

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
established itself within the
recipient, is that the donor bone

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000
marrow is established in the
recipient and populates all of these

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:31.000
different lineages. And if
we're able to look at the

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000
karyotype of these different kinds
of cells in the recipient organism,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
we can find that in some mice all
of these cells have the same very

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000
peculiar translocation. They
have either this one or this

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
one or they have yet
a third translocation,

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
any one of a whole series of
randomly occurring mutations,

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
a very peculiar idiosyncratic
unusual translocation induced by the

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:58.000
low-dose radiation.
They all have it.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
The T cells and the B cells and
the monocytes and the basophiles,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000
they all have exactly
the same translocation.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Obviously, we can't do that
experiment with the platelets.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Why? Because they don't have
nuclei. And we can't do that with

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
the erythrocytes either, the
red blood cells. Why can't we

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
do that? Because in mammals, when
the red blood cells are formed,

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
the nuclei are spit out. Our red
blood cells don't have nuclei in

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
them anymore. They've become
enucleate or, to put it another way,

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
they have been enucleated. That
is to say they've been deprived

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
of their nuclei. Why?
Because they're post-mitotic.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Obviously, a cell which lacks
nuclei is by definition post-mitotic.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:47.000
And our cells don't really need,
red blood cells don't need nuclei.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000
We know that ancestral
organisms, for instance chickens,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
their red blood cells are nucleated,
but our red blood cells are not

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
because they're
just not necessary.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
How is translocation
different from crossing over?

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Crossing over occurs between
two homologous chromosomes.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
So if we have a chromosome here,
here's chromosome 13 and here's

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
another chromosome 13,
they're both chromosomes 13.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
This one came from Ma. This
one came from Pa. All right?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Each of us has a pair of
homologous chromosomes.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Here's the maternal one.
Here's the paternal one.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
When we talk about crossing over
we're talking about a process of

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:47.000
homologous recombination.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And when that happens we
have a situation like this.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
This chunk is exchanged
with this chunk over here.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000
It's an equal exchange,
absolutely equal down to the

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000
nucleotide, so that after this
flipping has occurred we have two

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
fully intact chromosomes.
It's just that both of these

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.000
chromosomes are fully normal.
It's just that there's been a

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:12.000
switching, an exchange between
the two homologous chromosomes,

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.000
the two paired chromosomes 13.
When we talk about translocation

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:20.000
there a chunk of chromosome 15 can
go onto chromosome 7 or a chunk of

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:24.000
chromosome 2 can go on chromosome
8. It's totally random, it's

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
non-homologous, and it
creates aberrant chromosomes.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Neither of these recombined
chromosomes is abnormal.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.000
It's just changed it
allelic configuration.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.000
So, it's an important distinction.
And the fact is you can pick out

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000
these translocated chromosomes
because one even has specific dyes

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
that can be able to tell you which
chromosome this came from and which

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
chromosome this came from. So,
there is a profound difference.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Translocations are, invariably,
pathologic. When I say pathologic,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:02.000
I mean they're really sick.
They're not the proper course of

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.000
things that happens in
a healthy cell. The fact,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
the very fact that we're able to
generate an entire array of cells in

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
the blood indicated, by
necessity, that if all these

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.000
cells have the same chromosomal
translocation that they descend from

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.000
a donor cell that originally was
lightly irradiated and happened to

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:28.000
receive that translocation. If
we never get this array of common

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000
translocations in all the cells in
a bone marrow recipient then we can't

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000
prove this, but the fact is this has
been proven time and again over the

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
years. And this indicates to us
that this cell which is genetically

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
slightly altered can, therefore,
generate all these other

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
cells in the body. Again,
keep in mind that the

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
irradiation of the donor marrow is
simply to create these chromosomal

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
markings. They're not
necessarily good for the organism,

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
but they don't compromise
the viability of the cell.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
They just reshuffle the
chromosomal structure. Now,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000
in principle the levels of each one
of these kinds of end-stage cells

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:13.000
need to be carefully regulated.
And, by the way, let me just note

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
here, you see the T cells have
the arrow going back on themselves,

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000
as do the B cells. That indicates
that they have not become

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
post-mitotic. Remember we talked
about these embraces between helper

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
T cells and B cells where they're
walking down the allies and they get

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000
excited and they start multiplying?
The fact that the T cells and the B

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
cells are able to proliferate
in response to certain antigenic

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000
stimuli implies that they're not
post-mitotic. They still have the

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
ability to proliferate,
and that retained ability to

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.000
proliferate like that of hepatocytes
is indicated by these arrows that

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:54.000
are looping back on themselves.
Conversely, these cells are all

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
essentially, as I've said before,
post-mitotic. So how do we insure

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000
that's there proper concentrations
of all of these different

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
cells in the blood? And the
fact is the concentrations

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
of many of these cells in the blood
are maintained to concentrations of

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
plus or minus 10%.
And this is, itself,

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:19.000
a stunning testimonial to the
successes of human physiology.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000
We're talking here about a
process which is sometimes called

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:28.000
homeostasis. Homeostasis means
that somehow there is a balance,

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:33.000
an equilibrium that is achieved,
and that there aren't profound

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
fluctuations so that we always have
roughly the equal level of red blood

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
cells, a proper level of
lymphocytes in our blood.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
And I want to get into the
homeostasis which results in the

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
formation of red blood cells,
the RBCs, the erythrocytes in the

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
blood. In fact, it happens
to be the case that the

00:46:56.000 --> 00:47:01.000
red blood cells are one of the cell
types that could actually vary quite

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:06.000
profoundly in response
to environment.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
To the extent that lymphocytes
change, they go up and down,

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
that might be due in
response to an infection. So,

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
if we have a serious bacterial
infection we might have increased in

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
the lymphocytes in the blood that
have been mobilized in order to

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
attack the infecting bacteria.
But what about the RBCs? What

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000
about the red blood cells?
What causes them to change?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Well, if you move from here to
Denver, Colorado or you go up skiing

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
in the Rockies, you're
going up to ten or twelve

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
thousand feet. And within
a matter of three or four

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
days the concentration of your
red blood cells increases very

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:45.000
substantially. Why?
Because obviously the oxygen

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:50.000
tension at high altitude is down.
And in order that your peripheral

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.000
tissues become adequately oxygenated,
the oxygen carrying capacity of the

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:59.000
blood must be increased. And
the way that is increased is in

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:04.000
part to increase the
concentration of red blood cells.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
So how does that happen? How
is it possible that we can

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
rapidly modulate the
concentration of red blood cells?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.000
And the way we can do that is
in part through a hormone called

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:22.000
erythropoietin, EPO.
We're going to talk about

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.000
erythropoietin at the beginning
of the lecture next time,

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000
but the homeostasis which maintains
the appropriate number of red blood

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
cells in our circulation is dictated
in no small part by the levels of

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000
EPO that are in their blood.
To anticipate some of the things

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
we're going to say next time,
when you are in a low-oxygen

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:49.000
environment the levels of
erythropoietin shoot up.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000
And when they shoot up they insure
that there is shortly thereafter a

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:57.000
rapid increase in the level of
circulating red blood cells which in

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
turn enables the oxygen coming into
your lungs to be transported more

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
efficiently, more effectively
into the peripheral tissues.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
You've heard about athletes perhaps
who are able to dope themselves with

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
erythropoietin. This is
a rather devious strategy

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
because it means that if they do so,
they inject themselves with a little

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
erythropoietin, the
oxygen carrying capacity of

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
their blood is temporarily increased
and as a consequence they might be

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
able to run further or jump
higher. This, by the way,

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:33.000
has its dangers. Because if you're
injecting erythropoietin not in

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000
response to certain physiologic
signals but just because you want to

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000
win a marathon or something,
you're violating the normal

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:45.000
physiologic mechanisms in the body
which very carefully control the

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000
levels of erythropoietin.
And if you inject too much

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000
erythropoietin you get in a very
bad situation because the bone marrow

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
makes more and more red blood cells.
And then what happens? You start

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.000
clotting up everywhere all over
the body, and this isn't good.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
In fact, you can die. So
this is not a warning against

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:10.000
erythropoietin in the way that
I warned you against cigarettes.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000
This is just to tell
you these kinds of drugs,

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:19.000
or these kinds of growth factors,
which they are, are maintained at

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
very precise levels as we'll
discuss in more detail next time.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:28.000
See you on Wednesday.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.280
MICHAEL SHORT: Today I
want us to go more in-depth

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.092
into the photon
interactions with matter,

00:00:27.092 --> 00:00:29.300
and we're going to bring
the theory back to something

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.390
that we can actually
start to use in doing

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.440
shielding calculations.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.260
If you want to find out
how much of this material

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.720
do I need to shield
this much gammas,

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.795
we're going to answer
that question today.

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:42.170
First I want to
start off, again,

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.225
with Compton scattering
because I messed up

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:46.100
a couple of the energy
things from last time.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.610
I got excited due to an
energetic coincidence

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.520
between the photo peak and
the continent of our banana

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.600
spectrum and one of the
examples in the book.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.360
So I'm going to
correct that now,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.813
and we'll go through in
more mathematical detail

00:00:58.813 --> 00:01:00.230
why that wasn't
the case, and what

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.063
the actual quirk of
physics is because there

00:01:02.063 --> 00:01:04.430
is a constant energy
thing here that I

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.650
want to highlight to you guys.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:08.640
So skipping ahead on the
photoelectric effect,

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.540
which I think was similar,
to review Compton scattering.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.510
It's the same thing that we
saw between two particles,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.610
except now one of
them is a photon.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.370
And like I said, on the next
homework, after quiz one,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.890
you guys will be doing
the balance between energy

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.953
and momentum, because the
photons don't really have mass,

00:01:24.953 --> 00:01:26.870
in order to figure out
what's the relationship

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.900
between the incoming
energy of the photon,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.060
the outgoing energy
of the photon,

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.785
and the recoil energy
of the electron.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.830
And so these are
the relationships

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.190
we were showing last time.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.220
It is an interesting
quirk of physics

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.280
that the wavelength
shift itself does not

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.440
depend on the energy of
the photon coming in.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.520
As you can see, it just depends
on the angle that it scatters

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.030
at and a bunch of constants,
where that m right there stands

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.080
for mass of the electron.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.050
Now that wavelength shift--
while that wavelength shift

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.050
does not depend on the energy
of the incoming photon--

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.670
the recoil energy does.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.690
You can see it depends on
both the energy and the angle.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.920
And the incoming energy
of the photon equals h nu.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.948
And to give that quick
primer on photon things,

00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:16.990
I want to show you guys
here why that's the case.

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.110
So even if you have a
constant wavelength shift

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.180
that might give you a
non-constant energy shift.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.310
So even though in this
constant scattering formula,

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.700
the wavelength shift only
matters with the angle,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.440
the energy shift
actually depends

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.440
on the angle and the incoming
energy of the photon.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.680
So now let's look at a
couple of limiting cases.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.730
So as we have e of the
photon equals h nu goes to 0,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.170
what does t approach?

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.625
The recoil energy
of the electron.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.500
Let's just do out the formula.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.440
This recoil energy
equals h nu, which

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.160
is the energy of the
incoming gamma times 1

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:11.640
minus cosine theta over mc
squared over h nu plus 1

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.700
minus cosine theta.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.954
As h nu approaches
0, what happens here?

00:03:18.954 --> 00:03:19.840
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.673
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:03:20.673 --> 00:03:22.750
H nu goes to 0.

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:27.260
This fraction goes to infinity.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.030
And this goes to 0.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.580
Hopefully that's an
intuitive explanation.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.850
If the incoming
photon has 0 energy,

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.160
it can transfer 0
energy to the electron.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.410
Now the more interesting case.

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.822
What happens now as e
gamma approaches infinity,

00:03:46.822 --> 00:03:48.780
as the photon gets higher
and higher in energy?

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.772
AUDIENCE: T just
approaches h nu.

00:03:56.772 --> 00:03:58.658
MICHAEL SHORT: T
approaches almost h nu.

00:03:58.658 --> 00:04:00.950
I actually want to do a quick
calculation without doing

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.270
all the limit math.

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.970
Let's say we had
energy of the gamma

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.922
was 1 GeV, an
extremely high energy.

00:04:10.922 --> 00:04:12.380
So all we'd plug
in-- and let's say

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.660
we wanted to find out
what's the maximum energy

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:15.815
of this recoil electron.

00:04:15.815 --> 00:04:17.690
And this is something
I want to ask you guys.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.398
I can't remember.

00:04:18.398 --> 00:04:24.950
Yesterday did we say that
t is a maximum at theta

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.810
equals pi or pi over 2?

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.320
What did we say yesterday?

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.240
AUDIENCE: Pi over 2.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.365
MICHAEL SHORT: Interesting.

00:04:30.365 --> 00:04:31.790
It's pi, actually.

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.430
The case where you have the
largest energy transfer--

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.440
and sorry for not
catching that--

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.660
is just like in a
nuclear collision,

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.090
if the photon were
to back scatter,

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.580
it transfers the maximum
energy to the electron.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.130
So the analogy here
is, like, perfect.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.920
Between two particles
hitting and between a photon

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:52.160
and a particle hitting,
the maximum energy

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.780
is when theta equals pi.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:59.360
And let's actually plug
that in to find out why.

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.490
If we say t max equals h nu--
depends on the electron coming

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:05.420
in--

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:12.350
1 minus cosine theta over
mc squared over h nu plus 1

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.340
minus cosine theta.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.760
At theta equals pi, cosine
theta goes to minus 1,

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:24.740
and so then that
also goes to minus 1.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:34.738
And so this becomes 2h nu over
mc squared over h nu plus 2.

00:05:34.738 --> 00:05:36.780
And so that without worrying
about the numerator,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.380
especially in the limit of
very high energy photons,

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:44.310
you can see that that actually
maximizes the recoil energy

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.630
of the electron.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.630
The reason we're harping so
much on this recoil energy

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.990
of the electron is because
that's what we measure.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:54.730
So when we look at
our banana spectrum,

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.300
you're not measuring the
energy of the photon.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.130
You're measuring
the recoil energy

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:02.860
of the electron and
the ionization cascade

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.870
that happens as all
those electrons smash

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.750
into each other, creating
electron whole pairs, which

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.722
are counted as current.

00:06:09.722 --> 00:06:11.680
If you guys remember from
last class-- in fact,

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.450
I'll just bring up
the blackboard image

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:14.950
because we can do that.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.500
So I took a picture of
the board yesterday,

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.300
photon interactions Part 1.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:28.960
There it is.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:34.540
We'll just use the screen as
a bigger blackboard for now.

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.280
So if you guys
remember, let's say

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.430
a gamma ray comes in and
causes a Compton scatter

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.250
event or a photoelectric
emission, or whatever.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.960
It doesn't matter which process.

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.870
And it liberates an electron,
either by scattering off of it

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.610
or just getting absorbed
and ejecting it.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.010
Or it doesn't really
matter how, but it creates

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:52.870
this electron hole pair.

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.650
That electron right here
has this recoil energy,

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:59.482
which depends on theta,
the angle that it scatters

00:06:59.482 --> 00:07:00.190
and the incoming.

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.620
Energy and that
electron's going to keep

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.750
moving in this
material, knocking

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:07.930
into other electrons
very, very efficiently so

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:11.170
that most of the energy
of that electron recoil

00:07:11.170 --> 00:07:14.380
actually gets counted as
other electrons being freed.

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:15.940
We're going to go over on--

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.180
well, next Friday-- electron
nuclear interactions,

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.810
including what's the
probability in energy transfer

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.930
when electrons slam
into each other

00:07:24.930 --> 00:07:27.520
or when ions slam into
electrons or each other?

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.570
So let me go back to the slides.

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:40.900
And so this maximum, as
this approaches infinity,

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:50.290
this actually approaches a
value of h nu minus .255 MeV

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.840
Just to do the quick calculation
to give a numerical example,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.940
if I plug in theta
equals pi and h mu

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:04.630
equals 1 gig electron
volt, or 1,000 MeV.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.470
And can anyone remind me what is
mass of the electron c squared?

00:08:12.228 --> 00:08:13.770
What's the rest mass
of the electron?

00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:14.855
Sorry?

00:08:14.855 --> 00:08:15.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.190
MICHAEL SHORT: Right.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:20.730
While I'm usually against
memorizing anything--

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.520
because that's what books
and the internet are for--

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.130
this is one of those
quantities that I

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:28.740
want on the tip of your
tongue as nuclear engineers.

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.990
You should remember what the
rest mass of the electron

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:33.600
is because a lot
of our quantities

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.640
are calculated based upon it.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.980
For example, this ratio--

00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:40.770
what was it, h nu
over MeC squared--

00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:43.020
gives you the energy
the photon in terms

00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:45.450
of the number of
electron rest masses,

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.557
which is a useful
quantity in itself.

00:08:47.557 --> 00:08:49.140
So why don't I plug
all this stuff in.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:58.650
So we have .511 over 1,000 plus
2 flipped over the x-axis times

00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:02.070
2 times h nu.

00:09:02.070 --> 00:09:13.830
And we get-- so that
t becomes 999.745 MeV.

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:17.640
Interestingly enough, 1,000
MeV, our ingoing photon,

00:09:17.640 --> 00:09:25.630
minus that equals
that right there.

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:27.380
So that's the interesting
quirk of physics

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:31.460
is as the photon
increases in energy,

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.617
the maximum amount of energy
that it can leave with--

00:09:34.617 --> 00:09:36.200
or sorry, the minimum
amount of energy

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.290
the photon can leave with,
or the maximum amount

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.260
it can impart to an
electron approaches

00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:46.580
.255 MeV or the photon
energy minus that.

00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:48.330
What do you guys notice
about that number?

00:09:52.274 --> 00:09:53.253
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:53.253 --> 00:09:54.420
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.510
It's exactly half the
rest mass of the electron.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:01.620
So as your photons hit
the GeV range and above,

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.768
they can all leave
with half the rest

00:10:03.768 --> 00:10:05.310
mass of the electron
of energy, which

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.850
means you have more and more
energy able to be transferred

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:11.820
in a given Compton
scatter as the photon gets

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.770
higher and higher in energy.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:17.490
So for the limit of
low energy, the photons

00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:20.370
basically bounce off without
transferring much energy

00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:21.360
at all.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.400
And the higher in
energy the photon gets,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:27.970
the higher percentage of
that maximum transfer can be.

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:30.580
So that's what I wanted
to clarify from last time.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:31.990
It was an interesting
coincidence

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:34.810
that our photo peak
and our Compton edge

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.480
were pretty close to
that number apart.

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.440
But one MeV isn't
quite infinity.

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.440
But it is pretty close.

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.200
That difference right there,
what does that come out to?

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.430
Before I say something stupid,
I'll just calculate it.

00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:52.410
1.241.

00:10:52.410 --> 00:10:56.290
It's like 0.218 MeV, so we're
already most of the way there.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.140
So once you reach,
like, 10 or 100 MeV,

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.870
you're pretty much
at that limit.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:03.050
And so what that tells
you is that the distance

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.500
between a photo peak and
its corresponding Compton

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.190
edge for high energy photons
is going to be half the rest

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.090
mass of the electron.

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:14.400
Once you get to lower
and lower energies,

00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.813
that distance will
start to shrink.

00:11:17.813 --> 00:11:18.980
I'm sorry, other way around.

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.260
That distance will
start to grow.

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:25.380
And I have a few examples
I want to show you.

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.410
But first, in order
to understand these,

00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.160
now I want to get into
the part I told you

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.930
we'd get to yesterday,
which is what's

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.020
the probability that a
Compton scatter happens

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.520
at a certain angle?

00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:37.980
And this polar plot
explains it pretty well.

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.860
In the limit of
really low photons,

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:45.360
like .01 MeV or 10
keV photons, you

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.600
can see that this forward
scattering to an angle of 0,

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.790
or back scattering
to an angle of 180--

00:11:50.790 --> 00:11:54.240
there's a 180 that's blocked
by an axis right there--

00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.250
they're almost the same.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.980
So forward and back
scattering, there's

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:02.920
not really that much of a big
difference in probability.

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.780
So if we were going to start
graphing theta of this Compton

00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.570
scatter as a function of the--

00:12:09.570 --> 00:12:12.330
going to introduce this new
quantity, this angularly

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:16.912
dependent cross-section.

00:12:16.912 --> 00:12:18.620
Before we were giving
you cross- sections

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.200
in the form of just
sigmas, like sigma Compton.

00:12:23.828 --> 00:12:25.370
Now we're actually
telling you what's

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.970
the probability of that
interaction happening

00:12:28.970 --> 00:12:30.953
in this certain angle?

00:12:30.953 --> 00:12:32.870
So it's called the
differential cross-section,

00:12:32.870 --> 00:12:35.287
and you can have all sorts of
differential cross-sections,

00:12:35.287 --> 00:12:37.820
like energy differential
cross-sections,

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:39.800
angle differential
cross-sections,

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:41.860
whatever have you.

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.340
So if we try and graph what dpes
the shape of this look like,

00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:48.310
this polar plot on a more
understandable graph,

00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:51.350
we can see that the
probability is pretty high.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:54.950
Let's just call that a
relative probability of 1.

00:12:54.950 --> 00:12:57.740
And as we trace
around this circle,

00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:01.380
that value gets lower and
lower until we hit 90 degrees,

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:05.400
or pi over 2, at which point
it starts to pop back up

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.710
almost to its original value.

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:13.490
So this was for a 10 keV photon.

00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:16.010
Now let's take a
different extreme example.

00:13:16.010 --> 00:13:18.870
We have a 3 MeV
photon right here.

00:13:18.870 --> 00:13:22.650
And it's that long dashed curve,
so that one here in the center.

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.080
So we can see that the relative
probability of 0 degrees

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.580
is the same.

00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:28.230
And if we trace
around to 180, we're

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:32.220
almost at the origin, which
tells us that, for 3 MeV,

00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:36.750
it starts off the same and
quickly drops really far down.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.090
What that means is that what's
called forward scattering

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:44.245
is preferred.

00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:51.780
So up on this board,
we were talking

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.290
about what's the maximum energy
that a photon can transfer,

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:57.750
which is always in the
back scattering case.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:00.630
The other part to note is
that that back scattering

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:03.780
probability gets lower and
lower as the photon gets

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.310
higher and higher in energy.

00:14:05.310 --> 00:14:06.600
Yeah.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.267
AUDIENCE: So it's
that basically saying,

00:14:08.267 --> 00:14:10.245
since we said forward
scattering [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:10.245 --> 00:14:11.998
as the energy gets
higher, you just

00:14:11.998 --> 00:14:15.872
have a harder chance
of it interacting.

00:14:15.872 --> 00:14:16.830
MICHAEL SHORT: Exactly.

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:17.190
Yeah.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:18.815
The cross-section
value, well, yeah, it

00:14:18.815 --> 00:14:21.480
goes down as you
increase in energy.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.470
So a total forward scatter, if
you had a true forward scatter

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:30.810
where theta equals 0,
I'll call that a miss.

00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:32.880
It means that, because
we saw on this formula

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:39.840
up here when theta equals 0,
there is no energy transfer.

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.040
Nothing.

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.140
And so yeah, that would
be to me like a miss.

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.140
If that angles ever
so slightly above 0,

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:46.890
then there is some
scattering, but there's

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.990
very little energy transfer.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.690
But that smaller
energy transfer becomes

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:56.340
more likely when the photon
goes higher in energy.

00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:59.250
These are these sorts of
cause and effect relationships

00:14:59.250 --> 00:15:01.440
I want you guys to be
able to reason out.

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.680
If I were to give you a polar
plot of this differential

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.960
cross-section with
angle and energy,

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.020
I'd want you to be able to
reproduce this and tell me

00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:12.070
what's really going on.

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:14.410
If we fill in one of
the ones in between--

00:15:14.410 --> 00:15:20.260
let's go with 0.2 MeV, this
sort of single dashed line--

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:22.990
you can see that the
probability of back scattering

00:15:22.990 --> 00:15:27.250
is somewhere between the
3 MeV and the 10 keV.

00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:28.010
Yeah, Luke?

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.880
AUDIENCE: Back scattering
refers to the photon going back.

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.047
MICHAEL SHORT: That's right.

00:15:32.047 --> 00:15:35.680
Back scattering refers to the
photon going back, which means

00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.560
this situation,
where the difference

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.290
in angle between the
incoming and outgoing photon

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.470
is pi, 180 degrees, which means
it just turns around and moves

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:45.490
the other way.

00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:46.960
Right.

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:51.760
So that dashed line right
there would follow something

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.310
like this at-- what did we say?

00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:55.720
0.2 MeV.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.480
The form, the full form of
this cross-section right

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.540
here is referred to as the
Klein-Nishina cross-section.

00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:08.170
And it has been derived by
quantum electro dynamics, which

00:16:08.170 --> 00:16:10.180
I will not derive for you now.

00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.800
But there are plenty
of derivations

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.088
online if that's
your kind of thing.

00:16:14.088 --> 00:16:15.880
And I had to make a
trade-off in this class

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.760
of how deep do we go into
each concept versus how

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.660
many concepts do we teach?

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:23.040
And I'm going for the
latter because if there

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:24.748
is any course that's
supposed to give you

00:16:24.748 --> 00:16:26.470
an overview of
nuclear, it's 22.01.

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:30.060
There will be plenty of time
for quantum in 22.02 and beyond,

00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:31.690
should you want.

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.402
At any rate, this is
the general form of it.

00:16:34.402 --> 00:16:35.860
And what this
actually tells you is

00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.010
that as the energy of
the photon increases,

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:42.367
the effect of that angle will--

00:16:42.367 --> 00:16:44.700
you guys'll have to work that
out on a homework problem.

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:45.630
I just remembered.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:47.130
I want to stop
stealing your thunder

00:16:47.130 --> 00:16:48.547
and giving away
half the homework.

00:16:48.547 --> 00:16:49.700
Yep.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.022
AUDIENCE: How does [INAUDIBLE]?

00:16:57.988 --> 00:16:58.780
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.990
AUDIENCE: --the quantity
D sigma D omega.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:02.850
MICHAEL SHORT: The
quantity D sigma D

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:07.810
omega says let's say you have a
photon coming in at our x-axis.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.790
You've got an electron here.

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:13.829
What's the probability that
I'm going to scatter off

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:17.369
into some small area d omega?

00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:25.250
So in some small d theta d
phi, or some small sine theta,

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:30.012
d theta d phi, into an
element of solid angle.

00:17:30.012 --> 00:17:31.470
I should probably
draw that smaller

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:34.650
to be a little more
differential looking.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:38.220
So gammas are going to
scatter off in all directions.

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:40.227
But this d sigma
d omega tells you

00:17:40.227 --> 00:17:42.810
what's the probability that it
goes through that little patch?

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:52.370
AUDIENCE: And then that omega is
also a function of [INAUDIBLE]??

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:57.970
MICHAEL SHORT: So that omega has
some component of theta in it

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.550
and some component of phi in it.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.050
Since it's a solid
angle, it depends

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.530
on both the angle of rotation
and the angle of inclination,

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.510
which we call theta and phi.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:10.930
Now to get from this to the
regular cross-section you're

00:18:10.930 --> 00:18:17.710
used to, you can integrate
over all angles omega

00:18:17.710 --> 00:18:20.592
of the differential
cross-section,

00:18:20.592 --> 00:18:22.800
and you'll get the regular
total cross-section, which

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:25.530
is just what is the probability
of Compton scattering,

00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:27.022
full stop.

00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:28.480
If you wanted to
know, then, what's

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:32.500
the probability of Compton
scattering into this angle,

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:33.850
it sounds kind of boring, right?

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:35.500
Why do we care about the angle?

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.708
Anyone bored yet?

00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:37.750
You can raise your hands.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.540
Be honest.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.230
Interesting.

00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.920
OK.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.340
Well, I'm going to tell you
why it's not boring because I

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.200
don't think you're honest.

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:49.620
You can actually, if you know
the angle at which a Compton

00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:50.880
photon scatters into--

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:53.640
actually I want to
leave that stuff up--

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.760
there is a pretty much
one to one relation

00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:00.570
between the energy and
the angle of scattering,

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:07.240
which means that let's say
you have a cargo container.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:07.740
I'm sorry.

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.600
You don't have a
cargo container.

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.570
You have a cargo ship full
of tons and tons of these

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:18.030
stacked up cargo containers.

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.960
Has anyone actually ever
seen one of these before?

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:21.460
OK.

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.980
In case not, I'm going
to do something dangerous

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.180
and go to the internet.

00:19:26.180 --> 00:19:28.030
And hopefully the search
for cargo container

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:30.820
doesn't come up with
something disgusting.

00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:32.480
Oh, look at that.

00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:36.230
How about cargo container ship?

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:37.120
Yeah.

00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.330
OK.

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:41.000
You got one of these, right?

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.340
And your detector
goes off, and it just

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.170
says there is something
radioactive that

00:19:45.170 --> 00:19:46.520
shouldn't be here.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.110
How do you find
out which container

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.900
it's in without
taking the ship apart?

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:53.740
Interesting problem, huh?

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:55.090
Do you just kind of look-- yeah?

00:19:55.090 --> 00:19:56.590
AUDIENCE: Do you
kind of like shield

00:19:56.590 --> 00:19:58.336
certain angles [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.200
MICHAEL SHORT: That's one way.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.880
You could mask off the ship
and move your detector around,

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.070
and then do it for the
other two dimensions.

00:20:09.070 --> 00:20:12.443
So that will get you
there, but slowly.

00:20:12.443 --> 00:20:13.485
How do you do it quickly?

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:20.240
Well, you do it with the
Klein Nishina cross-section.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.060
If you know the relationship
between the energy

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.280
and the angle of
a Compton scatter,

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:30.630
you take two detectors,
Detector 1, Detector 2,

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:32.580
and you form what's
called a Compton camera.

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:40.220
This is awesome because
with two detectors,

00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.390
you can pinpoint the location of
a radiation source by knowing--

00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:48.410
let's say you had a gamma
ray that entered Detector 1.

00:20:48.410 --> 00:20:50.750
So you have your
initial e gamma.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.160
And you get a spectrum.

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.745
Let's draw a couple of spectra.

00:20:54.745 --> 00:20:56.120
I'm going to use
different colors

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.710
so I can make them bigger.

00:20:57.710 --> 00:21:03.420
This will be intensity
and this will be energy.

00:21:03.420 --> 00:21:07.130
So we have our blue
Detector 1, and we

00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:10.640
have some spectrum
for Detector 1

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:14.180
where we get the photo peak
of the gamma at e gamma.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.350
And this time, you don't
see every possible angle.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:23.935
You only see whatever angle you
get that Compton scatter at.

00:21:23.935 --> 00:21:26.060
Or you might see a whole
bunch of different angles.

00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:26.900
Never mind.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:29.250
So you're going
to see the Compton

00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.700
edge in this whole
continuum of things.

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.100
And so you know that whatever
energy this corresponds

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.040
to means that theta equals pi.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:41.240
That energy corresponds
to theta equals 0.

00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:45.440
And you know that there's
a source somewhere in here.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.090
Now let's say that photon
scatters out of Detector 1

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:53.690
and into Detector 2.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:55.610
In this case, you've
no longer just

00:21:55.610 --> 00:21:58.350
know that you have a
source of some sort.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.740
You'll end up with
a certain photo peak

00:22:00.740 --> 00:22:06.650
corresponding to this e
gamma prime, the only energy

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:09.780
that can Compton scatter in
the direction from Detector 1

00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:12.710
to Detector 2,
because you have now

00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:16.610
determined the angles between
the line between the detectors

00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.540
and the detector at the source.

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:25.770
So then you get a photo peak and
the corresponding Compton edge

00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.180
for your e gamma prime.

00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.200
Your e gamma prime, that tells
you the angle that it came off

00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.640
of for your first interaction.

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:39.980
So that is your source angle.

00:22:39.980 --> 00:22:43.010
So what that means is that
by using these two angles,

00:22:43.010 --> 00:22:48.930
you've now pinpointed your
source to lie somewhere

00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:57.730
on these two cones projected
back on one of the two points

00:22:57.730 --> 00:23:01.470
where those cones at
that angle intersect.

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:03.420
This is something I want
you to try and think

00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:05.530
about and work out on your own.

00:23:05.530 --> 00:23:10.292
But it's really cool to explain
this because with one detector,

00:23:10.292 --> 00:23:12.000
you know that there's
a source somewhere,

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.830
and you know generally
where to point.

00:23:13.830 --> 00:23:17.100
With two detectors
and energy resolution,

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:20.400
the energy of the photo
peak of the second event

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.268
tells you what the angle
of the first event was.

00:23:23.268 --> 00:23:24.810
And this way, if
you know what source

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.007
you're looking for from
the first photo peak,

00:23:27.007 --> 00:23:28.590
and you know what
angle you're looking

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:32.190
for from the Compton
scattered photons photo

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:34.950
peak, because they
have those, then you

00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:37.452
know not only what the
source is, but where it is.

00:23:37.452 --> 00:23:38.910
And you know which
container should

00:23:38.910 --> 00:23:41.115
take a part to start looking.

00:23:41.115 --> 00:23:43.240
So this is why we care
about angle, because there's

00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:47.170
actual, real ways of using
this to your advantage

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:50.390
to solve some pretty insane
problems, like which container

00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:52.500
would that be in.

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.030
Who's starting to get the
general idea behind a Compton

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:58.858
camera, or who would
like another explanation?

00:23:58.858 --> 00:24:00.713
Anyone?

00:24:00.713 --> 00:24:01.630
I asked two questions.

00:24:01.630 --> 00:24:03.682
So who would like
another explanation?

00:24:03.682 --> 00:24:05.050
Yeah, OK.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:07.360
The idea here is with
just one detector,

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.742
all you know is whether
or not there is a source.

00:24:09.742 --> 00:24:11.200
The only information
you're getting

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.920
is its photo peak and
Compton edge and bowl.

00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.170
And so you know the
identity of the source.

00:24:17.170 --> 00:24:19.180
Maybe it's cobalt
60 or something.

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.950
But you don't know where it is.

00:24:20.950 --> 00:24:23.410
By making a second
measurement, you

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:26.590
can then determine
where on the Compton

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:29.860
spectrum of the
first measurement

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.660
does the photon lie.

00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:33.910
So by saying OK, the
photo peak corresponds

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:36.490
to this energy,
which corresponds

00:24:36.490 --> 00:24:43.320
to some certain angle that
this had to scatter off of.

00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:46.770
So then you know
what this angle is.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:49.423
You've determined theta.

00:24:49.423 --> 00:24:51.340
AUDIENCE: Is that the
same theta that you just

00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:53.248
drew as theta angle?

00:24:53.248 --> 00:24:54.040
MICHAEL SHORT: Yes.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.540
OK.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:56.985
Angle.

00:24:56.985 --> 00:24:58.360
You've then
determined this angle

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.970
because you know the
incoming path of the photon,

00:25:00.970 --> 00:25:03.550
and you now know
the outgoing path,

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:05.740
which means you know angle.

00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:09.220
So if you know the line
between these two detectors,

00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:13.480
and your photo pick lines
up with your first Compton

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:18.070
spectrum's angle, you then
look at that angle back.

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.040
You also have to sweep around
in the other direction, which

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.220
means you end up with a
cone of possible locations.

00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:24.862
Yeah.

00:25:24.862 --> 00:25:26.612
AUDIENCE: How do you
know that the photons

00:25:26.612 --> 00:25:30.172
that get to the second scatter
from inside the first one?

00:25:30.172 --> 00:25:31.880
MICHAEL SHORT: There
can be only a couple

00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:33.890
of things that
could happen, right?

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.650
You could have another
direct photon just

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:37.880
shoot into Detector
2, in which case

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.420
you'll just get a little
bit of photo peak.

00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.300
But we know to expect
that, so we can ignore it.

00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.220
We're specifically
looking for the photo peek

00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:48.940
coming from Detector 1.

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:51.180
AUDIENCE: So they wouldn't
just go in the air

00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:53.990
and do Compton
scatter [INAUDIBLE]??

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:57.680
MICHAEL SHORT: They would,
which gives the perfect pretext

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.170
to bring up the cross-sections
for these processes.

00:26:01.170 --> 00:26:04.010
So I'm going to skip
ahead a little bit

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.740
and start getting into what do
the actual cross-sections look

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:09.830
like for Compton scattering,
photoelectric, and pair

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:10.820
production?

00:26:10.820 --> 00:26:13.280
All of them have to
do with the electron

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.350
density of the material.

00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:17.510
The more electrons
in the way, the more

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.250
you get these events happening.

00:26:19.250 --> 00:26:22.040
So yes, you will get
Compton scatters in the air

00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.250
because air contains electrons
and they do Compton scatter.

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:27.460
But air is not
very dense, so you

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:28.940
will get comparatively less.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.140
So let's say that adds
a little bit of noise

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.780
on the bottom, which is like
any detector spectrum we've ever

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:36.280
seen.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.020
There's always noise from
all sorts of other processes

00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:41.030
we're not looking for.

00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.690
So now let's start
to look at what

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:46.407
the general energy and z ranges
of each of these effects are.

00:26:46.407 --> 00:26:48.240
And we're going to
recreate one of the plots

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.350
that I showed you at the
beginning of yesterday's class.

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:56.100
So let's make a graph
of energy of the photon

00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:58.260
and z of the material.

00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:01.650
And we want to try to map
out where the following three

00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:03.030
processes are dominant.

00:27:03.030 --> 00:27:06.000
So tau, our
photoelectric effect.

00:27:09.910 --> 00:27:14.830
C, which we'll call
our Compton scattering.

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:18.411
And kappa, which we'll
call pair production.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.860
And these cross-sections do
give us relative probabilities

00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:28.280
as a function of the energy
of the photon and the medium

00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.830
they're going through, along
with the actual density,

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:33.060
that something's
going to happen.

00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.110
So let's look at
the form of these.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.420
The cross-section for the
photoelectric effect scales

00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.840
with z to the 5th.

00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.430
Do you think that
photoelectric effect

00:27:42.430 --> 00:27:47.124
will be more likely for
low z or high z materials?

00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:48.110
AUDIENCE: High.

00:27:48.110 --> 00:27:49.735
MICHAEL SHORT: High
z materials, right.

00:27:49.735 --> 00:27:52.730
So we know we're going to
be in the top half area.

00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:56.575
And it scales with one
over energy to the 7/2.

00:27:56.575 --> 00:27:57.950
So do you think
this will be most

00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:00.410
likely with low or high energy?

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.128
AUDIENCE: Low.

00:28:04.128 --> 00:28:05.420
MICHAEL SHORT: So lower energy.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:10.140
So we're going to fill in
our photoelectric somewhat.

00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.280
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.530
So we know it's going to
be in this part of the z.

00:28:13.530 --> 00:28:15.947
We know it's going to be in
this part of the energy curve.

00:28:15.947 --> 00:28:21.320
So let's fill in that
area as photoelectric.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.450
Let's look at the other
extreme, pair production.

00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.300
It scales with z
squared, so is that

00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.130
going to be in the low
or the high z area?

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.610
MICHAEL SHORT: I
think still high,

00:28:38.610 --> 00:28:40.440
just the bigger the z, the
bigger the cross-section,

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.100
right?

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.540
So we know that
pair production is

00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:44.220
going to be in the high z area.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:46.780
Now how about the energy?

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:48.850
It scales with
the log of energy,

00:28:48.850 --> 00:28:50.530
but the energy is on the top.

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:54.740
So will a low or a high energy
give you more pair production?

00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.240
High.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:59.110
So pair production
is going to be here,

00:28:59.110 --> 00:29:04.440
leaving everything else
for Compton scattering.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:09.020
And if we jump back to
the start of last class,

00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.260
we've reproduced from the
cross-sections the same sort

00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:16.210
of plot that we saw
before just from looking

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:20.450
at the relative probabilities
of each effect, which

00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:22.160
I think it's pretty cool.

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:26.100
We can now do that with some
basic physics knowledge.

00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:29.070
Last thing I want to fill in
for Compton scattering is that

00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:35.400
the Klein Nishina cross-section,
which is your differential

00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:38.310
cross-section as a
function of omega,

00:29:38.310 --> 00:29:44.520
combined with the probability
that you scatter into a certain

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.910
angle and a certain energy--
because there's a one-to-one

00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:50.530
relationship--

00:29:50.530 --> 00:29:52.690
ends up giving
you your d sigma c

00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:58.030
over de, which is your energy
distribution of Compton recoil

00:29:58.030 --> 00:29:59.380
electrons.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.490
And that's directly what
leads to the shape right here,

00:30:02.490 --> 00:30:05.650
where if you have,
let's say, 0.51 MeV,

00:30:05.650 --> 00:30:08.810
relatively low energy, there's--

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.210
let's see.

00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.650
What do I want to say here?

00:30:13.650 --> 00:30:14.150
Yeah.

00:30:14.150 --> 00:30:17.240
So as you go up in
higher and higher energy,

00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:19.340
you get fewer and fewer
Compton electrons,

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.190
because like Jared was
saying, the probability

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:23.870
of a Compton
interaction does go down

00:30:23.870 --> 00:30:26.900
with increasing energy, as
we kind of reasoned out.

00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:31.190
But in addition, you
get relatively more

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:34.880
of these back scattered ones,
which is kind of interesting.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.308
I have to think about that one.

00:30:36.308 --> 00:30:38.100
But this is the typical
shape that you tend

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.680
to see for Compton scattering.

00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.560
For high energy photons, you
get a Compton peak and then

00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.830
a very long, shallow tail.

00:30:46.830 --> 00:30:49.010
And as you go lower
and lower energy,

00:30:49.010 --> 00:30:50.900
it starts to sort
of bounce back up.

00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.650
And yeah, Luke?

00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:54.840
AUDIENCE: When Compton
scattering happens,

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:57.230
are the electrons being
knocked off the atom?

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:58.230
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, yeah.

00:30:58.230 --> 00:30:58.772
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:30:58.772 --> 00:31:01.160
So how is that different from
the photoelectric effect?

00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.785
MICHAEL SHORT: The
photoelectric effect

00:31:02.785 --> 00:31:04.920
is an absorption
followed by an injection.

00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.250
In Compton scattering, the
other photon is still intact.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:11.880
It just loses energy,
gains wavelength.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.700
But the energy of Compton
scattering is-- let's say,

00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:18.120
for MeV photons, it's on the
order of hundreds of keV--

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:21.298
plenty to eject most of
the electrons from an atom.

00:31:21.298 --> 00:31:22.840
So you always have
to think about are

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:24.250
you going to eject something?

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:26.200
Are you above the work function?

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.290
Work function for most atoms--

00:31:28.290 --> 00:31:30.230
so we had a nice plot of that--

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:32.140
is in the eV range.

00:31:32.140 --> 00:31:34.300
So chances are, yeah,
Compton scattering mostly

00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.280
is going to be ejecting
electrons, too.

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.350
That's the whole reason
we can count them.

00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.450
If there wasn't an
electron ejection,

00:31:40.450 --> 00:31:45.300
there would be no electron
ionization cascade to count.

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.880
So there's some sort of
empirical or experimental proof

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.670
that it does happen.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.130
And speaking of
experimental proof,

00:31:52.130 --> 00:31:53.720
you can actually see that shape.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.470
In this case, this is a spectrum
taken from two different gamma

00:31:57.470 --> 00:32:02.900
sources together, a-- what is
it, 1.28 MeV and a 0.51 Mev.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.270
And you can see that the
1.28 MeV, first of all,

00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.730
has a way lower
number of counts,

00:32:07.730 --> 00:32:09.650
showing that the
cross-section does,

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:12.500
indeed, decrease
with higher energy.

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.210
And it doesn't have-- well,
you can't really even see--

00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:18.620
but it does not curving
back up, whereas this lower

00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.230
energy Compton
photon is scattering

00:32:21.230 --> 00:32:23.630
more often because
it's much higher,

00:32:23.630 --> 00:32:28.273
and it's got that bump back
up at the really low energies.

00:32:28.273 --> 00:32:29.690
So it's kind of
neat when the math

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:33.230
that we're looking at, if I jump
ahead to the cross-sections,

00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:36.770
you can see that you'd
expect the Compton scattering

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.800
to decrease with energy.

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:42.650
And you look at an experimental
plot of two different energies,

00:32:42.650 --> 00:32:45.000
and there you have
it, higher energy,

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.060
less total Compton scattering,
but different shape.

00:32:51.890 --> 00:32:53.900
So any questions before
I move on to how you can

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.618
use them to design shielding?

00:33:01.970 --> 00:33:04.940
So what we're getting
here, these cross-sections,

00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:07.220
are probably better
known to some of you

00:33:07.220 --> 00:33:10.280
as mass attenuation
coefficients, which

00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:14.600
are simpler ways of
describing how many photons

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.410
in a narrow beam would
undergo some sort of process

00:33:18.410 --> 00:33:20.570
and be removed from the beam.

00:33:20.570 --> 00:33:22.670
And they get removed
exponentially

00:33:22.670 --> 00:33:25.070
for the same sort of reason
for pretty much everything

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:27.710
in this class ends up being
an exponential, doesn't it?

00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:33.080
Where if you have some
intensity of photons

00:33:33.080 --> 00:33:35.300
or some change in
intensity that's

00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:40.080
proportional to a change
in x in the initial--

00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.610
let's see-- and some--

00:33:42.610 --> 00:33:45.460
what is it, concept
of proportionality

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.580
like the cross-section,
or we'll call it now mu,

00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:50.890
this mass attenuation
coefficient.

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.140
The answer to that ends up
being pretty much the same.

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.520
And it's this simple
exponential thing.

00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.035
And the nice thing
is you don't have

00:34:00.035 --> 00:34:02.660
to calculate all these different
cross-sections because they're

00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.330
tabulated for you by NIST.

00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:07.190
And that's one of the
links on the website,

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:09.815
on the learning modules website
that I want to show to you guys

00:34:09.815 --> 00:34:10.639
now.

00:34:10.639 --> 00:34:14.090
You can actually look up these
total summed cross-sections

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:16.489
for gamma ray
interactions as a function

00:34:16.489 --> 00:34:19.850
of energy versus their mass
attenuation coefficient

00:34:19.850 --> 00:34:22.883
in centimeters squared per gram.

00:34:22.883 --> 00:34:24.300
The reason it's
in that unit is it

00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.880
just tells you what
the material does.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:29.330
It doesn't tell you how
much you have in the way.

00:34:29.330 --> 00:34:33.409
And that's why I've rewritten
this exponential attenuation

00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:36.260
formula with a rho on
the bottom and a rho

00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:39.409
on the top, that rho being
the density of the material

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.590
because usually you can just
say, it's like i naught e

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:44.030
to the mu x.

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:46.940
But these are the things that
you'll look up in tables.

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.370
And these rhos right
here is whatever density

00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.239
you have of your material.

00:34:51.239 --> 00:34:54.710
So if you want to calculate
how much better cold water is

00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:58.280
shielding than hot water because
of its change in density,

00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.845
you can then look up
the value for water,

00:35:00.845 --> 00:35:02.720
which I want to show
you how to do right now.

00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:10.090
Back up to see the actual site.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.450
So if you guys looked
right here, these--

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:13.350
what is it--

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:15.987
NIST tables of x-ray
absorption coefficients.

00:35:15.987 --> 00:35:17.820
I'll show you how to
read through this table

00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.640
now because you'll need it from
everything from problem set 5

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:21.930
to the rest of your life.

00:35:21.930 --> 00:35:24.750
This is one of those places
you're going to go constantly

00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:27.570
looking for nuclear data.

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.185
So you can either look
at elemental media

00:35:30.185 --> 00:35:32.310
or compounds and mixtures,
water being one of them.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:39.570
So let's go down
to water, liquid.

00:35:39.570 --> 00:35:41.280
If you notice what's
actually given here

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.470
is this view over row.

00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.510
So the nasty, what
is it, density

00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:48.820
specific mass
attenuation coefficient.

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:51.520
In other words, it's a
cross-section, really.

00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.317
It's a microscopic
cross-section.

00:35:53.317 --> 00:35:55.150
I don't know why, in a
lot of these courses,

00:35:55.150 --> 00:35:57.730
they're introduced separately
because they're the same thing.

00:35:57.730 --> 00:35:59.860
They're interaction
probabilities.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.477
And then that other
rho from the slides

00:36:02.477 --> 00:36:04.060
just tells you how
much is in the way.

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:06.460
That rho times x just
tells you how much

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.850
water's in the way in
terms of how dense it is

00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:12.760
and how thick your
water shield is.

00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:15.250
So using these tables,
if you know, let's say,

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.330
you're sending in
one MeV photon,

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.380
so we look up 10 to the 0 MeV--

00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:23.080
you then have this value,
this nice round value of 10

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:27.120
to the minus 1 centimeters
squared per gram.

00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.170
You then multiply by
the density of the water

00:36:29.170 --> 00:36:32.230
that you have multiplied by
the thickness of your water

00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:34.090
shielding, and
you get the change

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.570
in intensity of the photons.

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.160
And let's do an example
calculation just

00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.760
to make it a little more real.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:47.600
So let's say we have a beam of
photons of intensity i naught.

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:51.650
And we're sending it
through a tank of water.

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:54.680
And the question is, do you want
to keep this water at 0 Celsius

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:55.625
or at 100 Celsius?

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.270
What's the difference in
shielding between freezing

00:37:04.270 --> 00:37:06.250
and boiling liquid water?

00:37:06.250 --> 00:37:08.200
Well, we can look that up.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.820
And let's say we have to specify
an energy of the photons.

00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:14.040
We'll call it 1 MeV photons.

00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:19.970
So we can look up and say at
10 to the 0 MeV, we go over.

00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:23.870
We get just about
0.1 mu over rho.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:32.930
So mu over rho equals 0.1
centimeters squared per gram.

00:37:32.930 --> 00:37:36.530
And now we can set up two
equations, one for 0 Celsius

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:38.850
and one for 100 Celsius.

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:42.770
So we'll say i at 0
C equals i naught.

00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:49.880
E to the minus 0.1 times
rho at 0 Celsius times x.

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.140
Let's say we have, I don't
know, 10 centimeters of water.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:58.170
So we'll just put a 10 in there.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:01.350
That works out pretty well.

00:38:01.350 --> 00:38:07.410
And then our i at 100C is
the same i naught times e

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.280
to the minus 0.1
times rho of water

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.813
at 100 times 10 centimeters.

00:38:14.813 --> 00:38:16.230
And keep in mind
here, I made sure

00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:20.700
that since my mu over rho units
are in centimeters squared

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.970
per gram, I'm putting
in x as 10 centimeters

00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:27.635
because whatever is up
here in the exponential has

00:38:27.635 --> 00:38:28.260
to be unitless.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:33.420
That's a good check to see
why are my calculations off

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.290
by a factor of a billion?

00:38:35.290 --> 00:38:38.500
Just check the units
in the exponential.

00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.020
Yeah.

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:42.620
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't the
value of 0.1 change

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:47.090
for your cross-section
[INAUDIBLE]??

00:38:47.090 --> 00:38:48.590
MICHAEL SHORT: The
value of 0.1 will

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:51.680
change depending on the energy
of the incoming photons.

00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.340
AUDIENCE: I mean,
for the density.

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:53.850
MICHAEL SHORT: Nope.

00:38:53.850 --> 00:38:55.160
AUDIENCE: Density
changes, right?

00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:56.452
MICHAEL SHORT: Density changes.

00:38:56.452 --> 00:38:59.400
And that's what we account
for here with this rho.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.700
So next up we have to look
up the densities of water

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.470
at 0 and 100 Celsius because
I don't actually know them.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.120
So density of water at 0C--

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:13.520
oh, surprise,
surprise-- it's we'll

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:17.102
call it 1 gram per
centimeter cubed.

00:39:17.102 --> 00:39:18.060
Now what is it at 100C?

00:39:25.310 --> 00:39:28.540
Too close to tell.

00:39:28.540 --> 00:39:29.040
Actually.

00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:29.832
That's interesting.

00:39:29.832 --> 00:39:33.120
At 0 it's a little lower.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.492
AUDIENCE: No, I think that--

00:39:35.492 --> 00:39:37.200
MICHAEL SHORT: I think
that site's wrong.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.130
AUDIENCE: It's
definitely lower at 100C.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:38.640
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.807
AUDIENCE: I don't think
that second Google result is

00:39:40.807 --> 00:39:42.183
talking about 100 degrees C.

00:39:42.183 --> 00:39:44.100
MICHAEL SHORT: Let's
look at some steam tables

00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:47.280
because this is a real
place to look for them.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.200
So water is 100.

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.020
Celsius atmosphere is--

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.020
OK, we'll just see that.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.100
I think they're down here.

00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.100
Oh, the chalk's not letting
me use the touchpad.

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:02.200
That's kind of cool.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] water
at 100 degrees Celsius?

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:07.190
MICHAEL SHORT: Oh, there we go.

00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:08.820
Yeah, I think I got it.

00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:10.570
So what's the density
of saturated liquid?

00:40:10.570 --> 00:40:16.070
0.958.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:19.700
0.958 grams per
centimeter cubed.

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:21.900
Wow, I actually used
the last corner today.

00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:23.060
Awesome.

00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.540
So you can actually, then, go
ahead and calculate because--

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.460
I love how this
worked out, right?

00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:30.230
0.1 in 10, cancel.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:32.360
0.1 in 10, cancel.

00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:36.680
So we'll just do
e to the minus 1.

00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:45.920
And we get that this i is
about 36.79% of the gammas

00:40:45.920 --> 00:40:48.500
will be transmitted through
10 centimeters of water.

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:54.460
And here, e to the
power of negative 958,

00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.830
we get 38.37% transmission.

00:40:59.830 --> 00:41:02.270
So actually, about
2% more of the gamma

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:05.650
is will be transmitted
if the water is hot.

00:41:05.650 --> 00:41:08.260
It's a neat little
calculation that you can do.

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:13.300
Now we've looked at a
really fine, or very small

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.950
magnitude example.

00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:16.570
Folks came to me
yesterday saying

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:20.500
we want to design a new
type of medical x-ray apron

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.840
because we're worried that
people carrying around

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.420
all this lead, their
backs are hurting

00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.640
and it's making surgeons'
lives difficult if they're

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.410
doing radioactive procedures.

00:41:29.410 --> 00:41:32.350
Can we do any better?

00:41:32.350 --> 00:41:33.790
Can they do any better?

00:41:33.790 --> 00:41:35.790
What do you guys think?

00:41:35.790 --> 00:41:44.360
Can you beat physics when it
comes to mass attenuation?

00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.700
It's going to be
awfully difficult.

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:50.930
And the best weapon you have
is these mass attenuation

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.990
coefficients to look at
their relative values.

00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:57.480
Now these, again, are in
centimeters squared per gram.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.590
So this actually ranks
aluminum to uranium

00:42:00.590 --> 00:42:03.330
in a sort of like
per atom basis.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:06.020
It has nothing to do with
their higher densities, which

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.580
only help things.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:09.110
This just tells
you how effective

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:12.080
each of these elements
is relatively at blocking

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.090
gammas of different energies.

00:42:14.090 --> 00:42:16.190
Then, to get the total
amount of attenuation,

00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:17.990
you multiply by the density.

00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:19.660
Aluminum is pretty sparse.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:21.750
Lead and uranium
are pretty dense.

00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:25.550
There's not too many
ways around this problem.

00:42:25.550 --> 00:42:27.050
In fact, I wouldn't
say that there's

00:42:27.050 --> 00:42:29.280
a way around this problem.

00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.640
The best thing
you can do is look

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.550
at the really only interesting
features on these curves.

00:42:35.550 --> 00:42:38.060
Does anybody know why there's
those jagged edges there?

00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.940
Well, let's take a
look at some trends.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:50.030
For uranium, the jagged
edge is at about 110 keV.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.680
For lead, it's like 80 keV.

00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:57.540
For tin, it's probably
more like 50 keV.

00:42:57.540 --> 00:43:01.015
It's decreasing with z.

00:43:01.015 --> 00:43:02.640
Anyone remember what
sort of magnitude?

00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:06.000
We've looked at things
like this before.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.360
And if we're talking about
photon electron interactions,

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.020
what could be responsible for
those sudden jagged edges?

00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:24.880
Well, we have talked
before about all sorts

00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:27.310
of different decay
methods, including

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:31.090
those that can eject electrons
from different energy shells.

00:43:31.090 --> 00:43:34.210
You're looking at the same
electron energy shells.

00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:38.710
If you have a, let's say,
photoelectric capable photon

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.530
entering a calcium
nucleus-- and let's go look

00:43:41.530 --> 00:43:44.370
at calcium as an example.

00:43:44.370 --> 00:43:47.110
So I'll go to the
tables of coefficients.

00:43:47.110 --> 00:43:51.240
I'm going to back up
to elemental media.

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.130
And I'm going to go to
calcium for a simple example.

00:43:54.130 --> 00:43:57.490
Calcium has got this
jagged edge right here.

00:43:57.490 --> 00:44:04.290
And if we draw a line down,
it is precisely 4 keV.

00:44:04.290 --> 00:44:08.370
4 keV, I bet, is
going to be the k edge

00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:12.600
energy, the energy of the most
inner bound calcium electron.

00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.550
To find out, we can go
to the other NIST page

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:18.480
that I linked you guys to, the
NIST X-ray Transition Energy

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:20.040
Table.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.325
And let's look at calcium.

00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:27.760
Wow, this really doesn't work
with chalk on your fingers.

00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:31.170
And let's look at
the k edge to check.

00:44:31.170 --> 00:44:32.160
Lo and behold.

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.700
4.05 keV.

00:44:35.700 --> 00:44:40.740
So what you're seeing here is
the photoelectric peak k edge

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:41.850
absorption.

00:44:41.850 --> 00:44:45.480
What this says is at
energies below 4 keV,

00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.450
you can't inject the
innermost electron.

00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:50.430
You just don't
have enough energy.

00:44:50.430 --> 00:44:53.790
As soon as you hit 4 keV,
those inner shell electrons

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:55.470
become accessible to you.

00:44:55.470 --> 00:44:57.840
So the cross-section
suddenly jumps up

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.910
because you have more
electrons that you

00:44:59.910 --> 00:45:02.220
can inject photoelectrically.

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:05.640
Beyond 100 keV or so,
there's no more jagged edges

00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.960
because any photon above 100
keV can access pretty much

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.570
any electron in any
element, except maybe

00:45:12.570 --> 00:45:16.250
the super heavy ones, and we
don't have data for them yet.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.140
So then you might ask,
well, there's going

00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.660
to be an L edge for calcium.

00:45:20.660 --> 00:45:23.130
Where would that be?

00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:25.260
Probably off this chart.

00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:27.300
But you can look up
where it would be.

00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.510
So we'll go to the NIST--

00:45:28.510 --> 00:45:29.010
yeah.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.450
So you had the right idea, Dan.

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:31.470
To the left, right?

00:45:31.470 --> 00:45:32.770
Yeah.

00:45:32.770 --> 00:45:33.970
Exactly.

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:36.770
So now let's look up the L edge.

00:45:36.770 --> 00:45:39.020
So if I were to ask
you-- wow, it really

00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:41.160
doesn't work with chalk.

00:45:41.160 --> 00:45:44.440
OK, that's better.

00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:51.130
So the L1 edge is down at
438 eV, which is indeed

00:45:51.130 --> 00:45:52.630
off the scale for this graph.

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.940
This bottoms out at 1 keV.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:57.790
But if I were to ask you to
draw the full mass attenuation

00:45:57.790 --> 00:46:01.180
coefficient for
uranium, I'd expect

00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:04.840
to see a k edge, an L edge,
an m edge, and an n edge

00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.050
corresponding to shell
levels 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:46:08.050 --> 00:46:09.940
And where do you get that data?

00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:13.240
You get it from here,
from this NIST databases.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:16.600
Or you calculate it
one at a time using

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:30.850
that Rydberg formula, where
that n final goes to infinity.

00:46:30.850 --> 00:46:32.978
So you can either calculate
them if you don't know.

00:46:32.978 --> 00:46:34.770
Or if NIST doesn't have
them in the table--

00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:38.440
and I don't think
they have the n edge--

00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.090
wow, they go all the
way up to fermium.

00:46:40.090 --> 00:46:42.060
Let's do uranium.

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.620
What do they go to?

00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:44.120
Yep.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.340
They don't have the
m or the n edge.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.270
But you do know how to calculate
them, is with that formula.

00:46:50.270 --> 00:46:54.200
And so if we were to
construct any old mass--

00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:56.030
what is it, mass
coefficient-- good,

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:58.175
we have a little space left.

00:46:58.175 --> 00:46:59.800
It's going to look
generally like this.

00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.500
There's going to be a
photoelectric region.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.000
Let's say that's
going to correspond

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.370
to our photoelectric
cross-section, which goes

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.560
way up with lower energies.

00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:14.070
There's going to be a pair
production part, which

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:16.290
goes up with higher energies.

00:47:16.290 --> 00:47:20.130
And there's going to be this
kind of decreasing Compton

00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.720
cross-section.

00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:24.820
And if you kind of
dance these curves,

00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:27.040
you end up with a
shape like that,

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.980
which is just like all the other
mass attenuation coefficients

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:30.813
that you see.

00:47:30.813 --> 00:47:32.230
So this is why
they take the shape

00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:35.080
that they do if you add
up the cross-sections

00:47:35.080 --> 00:47:39.850
for photoelectric effect,
Compton scattering, and pair

00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:43.090
production, and you just kind
of bounce on top of those,

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:45.953
you end up with the mass
attenuation coefficient.

00:47:45.953 --> 00:47:47.370
And the part that's
not shown here

00:47:47.370 --> 00:47:50.490
is that this
photoelectric effect

00:47:50.490 --> 00:47:52.050
will have some
jagged edges whenever

00:47:52.050 --> 00:47:55.282
you hit an electron
energy transition level.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:00.110
So it's five of.

00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:02.910
Want to see if you guys
have any questions on photon

00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:04.580
interactions with matter.

00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.910
I know it's a lot to
throw at you at once,

00:48:08.910 --> 00:48:11.700
but I'm going to be giving you
guys lots to calculate, to try

00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:14.640
it out and to learn what's
going on from a more hands

00:48:14.640 --> 00:48:17.230
on point of view.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:17.730
Yeah.

00:48:17.730 --> 00:48:21.200
AUDIENCE: So you can't,
I guess, beat physics

00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:24.520
by increasing
density of materials.

00:48:24.520 --> 00:48:26.985
Is there a way to
slow down gammas?

00:48:26.985 --> 00:48:29.100
MICHAEL SHORT: Is there a
way to slow down gammas?

00:48:29.100 --> 00:48:31.497
AUDIENCE: Besides
relying on [INAUDIBLE]??

00:48:31.497 --> 00:48:32.330
MICHAEL SHORT: Yeah.

00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:34.550
So the question is, can
you slow down gammas

00:48:34.550 --> 00:48:37.848
without putting
stuff in the way?

00:48:37.848 --> 00:48:39.140
Well, then, what are you doing?

00:48:39.140 --> 00:48:41.680
You've got a vacuum, right?

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:44.140
So-- hmm.

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.390
That's probably a deeper
question than I think.

00:48:47.390 --> 00:48:50.300
So gammas, for example,
do have indices

00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.460
of refraction and materials.

00:48:52.460 --> 00:48:53.480
Gammas are just photons.

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.130
They're just really high energy.

00:48:55.130 --> 00:48:57.170
And they do have
indices of refraction

00:48:57.170 --> 00:48:59.300
that are usually around
one part per million,

00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.420
or like 1.000001 or so.

00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.850
So you can refract
or bend gamma.

00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:07.110
Just not very well.

00:49:07.110 --> 00:49:08.860
So the question is,
could you do something

00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:12.380
to stop the gammas that
were maybe 10 feet away?

00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:14.447
The answer is physics.

00:49:14.447 --> 00:49:15.280
Not much you can do.

00:49:18.130 --> 00:49:20.160
But if they're, like,
planetary levels away,

00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.380
it's possible that you could
bend them away from an object,

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:24.713
just like you can bend visible
light away from something

00:49:24.713 --> 00:49:26.220
closer up because
it's got a much

00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:27.785
higher index of refraction.

00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.495
Pretty crazy stuff.

00:49:31.495 --> 00:49:34.120
Did you ever think of gamma ray
as having indices of refraction

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:36.890
and behaving like regular light?

00:49:36.890 --> 00:49:38.570
It's just regular light.

00:49:38.570 --> 00:49:41.968
It's just really
high energy light.

00:49:41.968 --> 00:49:44.010
So any other questions on
the photon interactions

00:49:44.010 --> 00:49:45.010
with matter?

00:49:48.910 --> 00:49:50.460
Cool.

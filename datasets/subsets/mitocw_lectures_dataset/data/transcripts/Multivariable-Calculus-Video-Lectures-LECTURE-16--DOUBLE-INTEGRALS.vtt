00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So, basically the last few
weeks, we've been doing

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
derivatives.
Now, we're going to integrals.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So -- OK, so more precisely,
we are going to be talking

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:58.000
about double integrals.
OK, so just to motivate the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
notion,
let me just remind you that

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
when you have a function of one
variable -- -- say,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
f of x,
and you take its integrals

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
from, say,
a to b of f of x dx,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:33.000
well, that corresponds to the
area below the graph of f over

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the interval from a to b.
OK, so the picture is something

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
like you have a;
you have b.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You have the graph of f,
and then what the integral

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
measures is the area of this
region.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
And, when we say the area of
this region, of course,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
if f is positive,
that's what happens.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000
If f is negative,
then we count negatively the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
area below the x axis.
OK, so, now,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
when you have a function of two
variables, then you can try to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
do the same thing.
Namely, you can plot its graph.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Its graph will be a surface in
space.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
And then, we can try to look
for the volume below the graph.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And that's what we will call
the double integral of the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
function over a certain region.
OK, so let's say that we have a

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
function of two variables,
x and y.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Then, we'll look at the volume
that's below the graph z equals

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
f of xy.
OK, so, let's draw a picture

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
for what this means.
I have a function of x and y.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I can draw its graph.
The graph will be the surface

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
with equation z equals f of x
and y.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
And, well, I have to decide
where I will integrate the

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
function.
So, for that,

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I will choose some region in
the xy plane.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:39.000
And, I will integrate the
function on that region.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.000
So, it's over a region,
R, in the xy plane.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
So, I have this region R and I
look at the piece of the graph

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000
that is above this region.
And, we'll try to compute the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.000
volume of this solid here.
OK, that's what the double

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
integral will measure.
So, we'll call that the double

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
integral of our region,
R, of f of xy dA and I will

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
have to explain what the
notation means.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
So, dA here stands for a piece
of area.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
A stands for area.
And, well, it's a double

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
integral.
So, that's why we have two

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
integral signs.
And, we'll have to indicate

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
somehow the region over which we
are integrating.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
OK, we'll come up with more
concrete notations when we see

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000
how to actually compute these
things.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
That's the basic definition.
OK, so actually,

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000
how do we define it,
that's not really much of a

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000
definition yet.
How do we actually define this

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
rigorously?
Well, remember,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
the integral in one variable,
you probably saw a definition

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
where you take your integral
from a to b,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000
and you cut it into little
pieces.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And then, for each little
piece, you take the value of a

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
function, and you multiply by
the width of a piece.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000
That gives you a rectangular
slice, and then you sum all of

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
these rectangular slices
together.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
So, here we'll do the same
thing.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So, well, let me put a picture
up and explain what it does.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
So, we're going to cut our
origin into little pieces,

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
say, little rectangles or
actually anything we want.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
And then, for each piece,
with the small area, delta A,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000
we'll take the area delta a
times the value of a function in

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000
there that will give us the
volume of a small box that sits

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
under the graph.
And then, we'll add all these

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
boxes together.
That gives us an estimate of a

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000
volume.
And then, to get actually the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
integral,
the integral will be defined as

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
a limit as we subdivide into
smaller and smaller boxes,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
and we sum more and more
pieces,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
OK?
So, actually,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000
what we do, oh,
I still have a board here.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:20.000
So, the actual definition
involves cutting R into small

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000
pieces of area that's called
delta A or maybe delta Ai,

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000
the area of the i'th piece.
And then, OK,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:42.000
so maybe in the xy plane,
we have our region,

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000
and we'll cut it may be using
some grade.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000
OK, and then we'll have each
small piece.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Each small piece will have area
delta Ai and it will be at some

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.000
point, let's call it xi,
yi ...

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:13.000
yi, xi.
And then, we'll consider the

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000
sum over all the pieces of f at
that point, xi,

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
yi times the area of a small
piece.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
So, what that corresponds to in
the three-dimensional picture is

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
just I sum the volumes of all of
these little columns that sit

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:36.000
under the graph.
OK, and then,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:49.000
so what I do is actually I take
the limit as the size of the

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:57.000
pieces tends to zero.
So, I have more and more

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
smaller and smaller pieces.
And, that gives me the double

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000
integral.
OK, so that's not a very good

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
sentence, but whatever.
So, OK, so that's the

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
definition.
Of course, we will have to see

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000
how to compute it.
We don't actually compute it.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
When you compute an integral in
single variable calculus,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
you don't do that.
You don't cut into little

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
pieces and sum the pieces
together.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
You've learned how to integrate
functions using various

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
formulas,
and similarly here,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
we'll learn how to actually
compute these things without

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
doing that cutting into small
pieces.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
OK, any questions first about
the concept, or what the

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:48.000
definition is?
Yes?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Well, so we'll have to learn
which tricks work,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.000
and how exactly.
But, so what we'll do actually

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000
is we'll reduce the calculation
of a double integral to two

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
calculations of single
integrals.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
And so, for V,
certainly, all the tricks

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000
you've learned in single
variable calculus will come in

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000
handy.
OK, so,

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
yeah that's a strong suggestion
that if you've forgotten

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
everything about single variable
calculus,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:17.000
now would be a good time to
actually brush up on integrals.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
The usual integrals,
and the usual substitution

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
tricks and easy trig in
particular, these would be very

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
useful.
OK, so, yeah,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
how do we compute these things?
That's what we would have to

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000
come up with.
And, well,

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000
going back to what we did with
derivatives,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
to understand variations of
functions and derivatives,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
what we did was really we took
slices parallel to an axis or

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
another one.
So, in fact,

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000
here, the key is also the same.
So, what we are going to do is

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
instead of cutting into a lot of
small boxes like that and

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000
summing completely at random,
we will actually somehow scan

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000
through our region by parallel
planes,

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
OK?
So, let me put up,

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
actually, a slightly different
picture up here.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So, what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take planes,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000
say in this picture,
parallel to the yz plane.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
I'll take a moving plane that
scans from the back to the front

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.000
or from the front to the back.
So, that means I set the value

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
of x, and I look at the slice,
x equals x0,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000
and then I will do that for all
values of x0.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000
So, now in each slice,
well, I get what looks a lot

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000
like a single variable integral.
OK, and that integral will tell

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
me, what is the area in this?
Well, I guess it's supposed to

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
be green, but it all comes as
black, so, let's say the black

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
shaded slice.
And then, when I add all of

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000
these areas together,
as the value of x changes,

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:00.000
I will get the volume.
OK, let me try to explain that

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:07.000
again.
So, to compute this integral,

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:16.000
what we do is actually we take
slices.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:29.000
So, let's consider,
let's call s of x the area of a

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:41.000
slice, well, by a plane parallel
to the yz plane.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.000
OK, so on the picture,
s of x is just the area of this

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
thing in the vertical wall.
Now, if you sum all of these,

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
well, why does that work?
So, if you take the origin

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
between two parallel slices that
are very close to each other,

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000
what's the volume in these two
things?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Well, it's essentially s of x
times the thickness of this very

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000
thin slice,
and the thickness would be

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:16.000
delta x0 dx if you take a limit
with more and more slices.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:25.000
OK, so the volume will be the
integral of s of x dx from,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:32.000
well, what should be the range
for x?

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Well, we would have to start at
the very lowest value of x that

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
ever happens in our origin,
and we'd have to go all the way

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
to the very largest value of x,
from the very far back to the

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
very far front.
So, in this picture,

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:57.000
we probably start over here at
the back, and we'd end over here

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:05.000
at the front.
So, let me just say from the

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:13.000
minimum, x, to the maximum x.
And now, how do we find S of x?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Well, S of x will be actually
again an integral.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
But now, it's an integral of
the variable,

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
y, because when we look at this
slice, what changes from left to

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:35.000
right is y.
So, well let me actually write

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
that down.
For a given,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:48.000
x, the area S of x you can
compute as an integral of f of

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
x, y dy.
OK, well, now x is a constant,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
and y will be the variable of
integration.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000
What's the range for y?
Well, it's from the leftmost

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
point here to the rightmost
point here on the given slice.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
So, there is a big catch here.
That's a very important thing

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
to remember.
What is the range of

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
integration?
The range of integration for y

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
depends actually on x.
See, if I take the slice that's

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
pictured on that diagram,
then the range for y goes all

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
the way from the very left to
the very right.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
But, if I take a slice that,
say, near the very front,

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000
then in fact,
only a very small segment of it

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000
will be in my region.
So, the range of values for y

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
will be much less.
Let me actually draw a 2D

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
picture for that.
So, remember,

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
we fix x, so,
sorry, so we fix a value of x.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
OK, and for a given value of x,
what we will do is we'll slice

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
our graph by this plane parallel
to the yz plane.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
So, now we mention the graph is
sitting above that.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000
OK, that's the region R.
We have the region,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000
R, and I have the graph of a
function above this region,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
R.
And, I'm trying to find the

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
area between this segment and
the graph above it in this

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
vertical plane.
Well, to do that,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I have to integrate from y
going from here to here.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I want the area of a piece that
sits above this red segment.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
And, so in particular,
the endpoints,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
the extreme values for y depend
on x because,

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
see,
if I slice here instead,

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:54.000
well, my bounds for y will be
smaller.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
OK, so now, if I put the two
things together,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:15.000
what I will get -- -- is
actually a formula where I have

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:30.000
to integrate -- -- over x -- --
an integral over y.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:42.000
OK, and so this is called an
iterated integral because we

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:54.000
iterate twice the process of
taking an integral.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.000
OK, so again,
what's important to realize

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
here,
I mean, I'm going to say that

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000
several times over the next few
days but that's because it's the

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000
single most important thing to
remember about double integrals,

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
the bounds here are just going
to be numbers,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000
OK, because the question I'm
asking myself here is,

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
what is the first value of x by
which I might want to slice,

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000
and what is the last value of x?
Which range of x do I want to

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
look at to take my red slices?
And, the answer is I would go

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
all the way from here,
that's my first slice,

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.000
to somewhere here.
That's my last slice.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
For any value in between these,
I will have some red segment,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
and I will want to integrate
over that that.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
On the other hand here,
the bounds will depend on the

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
outer variable,
x,

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:54.000
because at a fixed value of x,
what the values of y will be

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.000
depends on x in general.
OK, so I think we should do

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:11.000
lots of examples to convince
ourselves and see how it works.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Yeah, it's called an iterated
integral because first we

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000
integrated over y,
and then we integrate again

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.000
over x, OK?
So, we can do that,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000
well, I mean,
y depends on x or x depends,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000
no, actually x and y vary
independently of each other

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
inside here.
What is more complicated is how

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
the bounds on y depend on x.
But actually,

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000
you could also do the other way
around: first integrate over x,

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:39.000
and then over y,
and then the bounds for x will

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000
depend on y.
We'll see that on an example.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Yes?
So, for y, I'm using the range

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
of values for y that corresponds
to the given value of x,

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
OK?
Remember, this is just like a

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000
plot in the xy plane.
Above that, we have the graph.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Maybe I should draw a picture
here instead.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000
For a given value of x,
so that's a given slice,

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
I have a range of values for y,
that is,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000
from this picture at the
leftmost point on that slice to

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
the rightmost point on that
slice.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:24.000
So, where start and where I
stop depends on the value of x.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Does that make sense?
OK.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:45.000
OK, no more questions?
OK, so let's do our first

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.000
example.
So, let's say that we want to

00:19:52.000 --> 00:20:00.000
integrate the function 1-x^2-y^2
over the region defined by x

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000
between 0 and 1,
and y between 0 and 1.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000
So, what does that mean
geometrically?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Well, z = 1-x^2-y^2,
and it's a variation on,

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
actually I think we plotted
that one, right?

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:22.000
That was our first example of a
function of two variables

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.000
possibly.
And, so, we saw that the graph

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000
is this paraboloid pointing
downwards.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
OK, it's what you get by taking
a parabola and rotating it.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000
And now, what we are asking is,
what is the volume between the

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000
paraboloid and the xy plane over
the square of side one in the xy

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
plane over the square of side
one in the xy plane,

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.000
x and y between zero and one.
OK, so, what we'll do is we'll,

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:54.000
so, see, here I try to
represent the square.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And, we'll just sum the areas
of the slices as,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
say, x varies from zero to one.
And here, of course,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
setting up the bounds will be
easy because no matter what x I

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
take, y still goes from zero to
one.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000
See, it's easiest to do double
integrals what the region is

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000
just a rectangle on the xy plane
because then you don't have to

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000
worry too much about what are
the ranges.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:29.000
OK, so let's do it.
Well, that would be the

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:38.000
integral from zero to one of the
integral from zero to one of

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
1-x^2-y^2 dy dx.
So, I'm dropping the

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
parentheses.
But, if you still want to see

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
them, I'm going to put that in
very thin so that you see what

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
it means.
But, actually,

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
the convention is we won't put
this parentheses in there

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
anymore.
OK, so what this means is first

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
I will integrate 1-x^2-y^2 over
y, ranging from zero to one with

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:07.000
x held fixed.
So, what that represents is the

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
area in this slice.
So, see here,

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
I've drawn, well,
what happens is actually the

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
function takes positive and
negative values.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
So, in fact,
I will be counting positively

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000
this part of the area.
And, I will be counting

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000
negatively this part of the
area, I mean,

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:32.000
as usual when I do an integral.
OK, so what I will do to

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:40.000
evaluate this,
I will first do what's called

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:48.000
the inner integral.
So, to do the inner integral,

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:55.000
well, it's pretty easy.
How do I integrate this?

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Well, it becomes,
so, what's the integral of one?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
It's y.
Just anything to remember is we

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000
are integrating this with
respect to y,

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:08.000
not to x.
The integral of x^2 is x^2

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000
times y.
And, the integral of y^2 is y^3

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
over 3.
OK, and that we plug in the

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
bounds, which are zero and one
in this case.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And so, when you plug y equals
one, you will get one minus x^2

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
minus one third minus,
well, for y equals zero you get

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:41.000
0,0, 0, so nothing changes.
OK, so you are left with two

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
thirds minus x^2.
OK, and that's a function of x

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
only.
Here, you shouldn't see any y's

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
anymore because y was your
integration variable.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:55.000
But, you still have x.
You still have x because the

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
area of this shaded slice
depends, of course,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
on the value of x.
And, so now,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:11.000
the second thing to do is to do
the outer integral.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000
So, now we integrate from zero
to one what we got,

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000
which is two thirds minus x^2
dx.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.000
OK, and we know how to compute
that because that integrates to

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:31.000
two thirds x minus one third x^3
between zero and one.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000
And, I'll let you do the
computation.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:43.000
You will find it's one third.
OK, so that's the final answer.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.000
So, that's the general pattern.
When we have a double integral

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
to compute, first we want to set
it up carefully.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
We want to find,
what will be the bounds in x

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:53.000
and y?
And here, that was actually

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000
pretty easy because our equation
was very simple.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Then, we want to compute the
inner integral,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000
and then we compute the outer
integral.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:11.000
And, that's it.
OK, any questions at this point?

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
No?
OK, so, by the way,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000
we started with dA in the
notation, right?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Here we had dA.
And, that somehow became a dy

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
dx.
OK,

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:35.000
so,
dA became dy dx because when we

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
do the iterated integral this
way,

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000
what we're actually doing is
that we are slicing our origin

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000
into small rectangles.
OK, that was the area of this

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
small rectangle here?
Well, it's the product of its

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:58.000
width times its height.
So, that's delta x times delta

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
y.
OK, so, delta a equals delta x

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
delta y becomes...
So actually,

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:18.000
it's not just becomes,
it's really equal.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:28.000
So, the small rectangles for.
Now, it became dy dx and not dx

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
dy.
Well, that's a question of,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
in which order we do the
iterated integral?

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
It's up to us to decide whether
we want to integrate x first,

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
then y, or y first,
then x.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
But, as we'll see very soon,
that is an important decision

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
when it comes to setting up the
bounds of integration.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Here, it doesn't matter,
but in general we have to be

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
very careful about in which
order we will do things.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Yes?
Well, in principle it always

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
works both ways.
Sometimes it will be that

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:04.000
because the region has a strange
shape, you can actually set it

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
up more easily one way or the
other.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Sometimes it will also be that
the function here,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
you actually know how to
integrate in one way,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
but not the other.
So, the theory is that it

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
should work both ways.
In practice,

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.000
one of the two calculations may
be much harder.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:33.000
OK.
Let's do another example.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Let's say that what I wanted to
know was not actually what I

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
computed,
namely, the volume below the

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
paraboloid,
but also the negative of some

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
part that's now in the corner
towards me.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000
But let's say really what I
wanted was just the volume

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:54.000
between the paraboloid and the
xy plane,

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:58.000
so looking only at the part of
it that sits above the xy plane.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.000
So, that means,
instead of integrating over the

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
entire square of size one,
I should just integrate over

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
the quarter disk.
I should stop integrating where

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:18.000
my paraboloid hits the xy plane.
So, let me draw another picture.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:28.000
So, let's say I wanted to
integrate, actually -- So,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.000
let's call this example two.
So, we are going to do the same

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
function but over a different
region.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
And, the region will just be,
now, this quarter disk here.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:55.000
OK, so maybe I should draw a
picture on the xy plane.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:14.000
That's your region, R.
OK, so in principle,

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000
it will be the same integral.
But what changes is the bounds.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Why do the bounds change?
Well, the bounds change because

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
now if I set,
if I fixed some value of x,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
then I want to integrate this
part of the slice that's above

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000
the xy plane and I don't want to
take this part that's actually

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
outside of my disk.
So, I should stop integrating

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
over y when y reaches this value
here.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:46.000
OK, on that picture here,
on this picture,

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000
it tells me for a fixed value
of x, the range of values for y

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
should go only from here to
here.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000
So, that's from here to less
than one.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:07.000
OK, so for a given,
x, the range of y is,

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:16.000
well, so what's the lowest
value of y that we want to look

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
at?
It's still zero.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
From y equals zero to,what's
the value of y here?

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000
Well, I have to solve in the
equation of a circle,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000
OK?
So, if I'm here,

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:39.000
this is x^2 y^2 equals one.
That means y is square root of

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000
one minus x^2.
OK, so I will integrate from y

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
equals zero to y equals square
root of one minus x^2.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.000
And, now you see how the bound
from y will depend on the value

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
of x.
OK, so while I erase,

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000
I will let you think about,
what is the bound for x now?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
It's a trick question.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:48.000
OK, so I claim that what we
will do -- We write this as an

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:57.000
iterated integral first dy then
dx.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And, we said for a fixed value
of x, the range for y is from

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
zero to square root of one minus
x^2.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
What about the range for x?
Well, the range for x should

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
just be numbers.
OK, remember,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
the question I have to ask now
is if I look at all of these

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
yellow slices,
which one is the first one that

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
I will consider?
Which one is the last one that

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000
I want to consider?
So, the smallest value of x

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
that I want to consider is zero
again.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
And then, I will have actually
a pretty big slice.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And I will get smaller,
and smaller,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
and smaller slices.
And, it stops.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
I have to stop when x equals
one.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Afterwards, there's nothing
else to integrate.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:49.000
So, x goes from zero to one.
OK, and now,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:52.000
see how in the inner integral,
the bounds depend on in the

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000
inner integral,
the bounds depend on x.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000
In the outer one,
you just get numbers because

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
the questions that you have to
ask to set up this one and set

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000
up that one are different.
Here, the question is,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
if I fix a given,
x, if I look at a given slice,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000
what's the range for y?
Here, the question is,

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
what's the first slice?
What is the last slice?

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Does that make sense?
Everyone happy with that?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:28.000
OK, very good.
So, now, how do we compute that?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Well, we do the inner integral.
So, that's an integral from

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:42.000
zero to square root of one minus
x^2 of one minus x^2 minus y^2

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:48.000
dy.
And, well, that integrates to

00:33:48.000 --> 00:34:00.000
y-x^2y-y^3 over three from zero
to square root of one minus x^2.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:06.000
And then, that becomes,
well, the root of one minus x^2

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:13.000
minus x^2 root of one minus x^2
minus y minus x^2 to the three

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
halves over three.
And actually,

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.000
if you look at it for long
enough, see, this says one minus

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
x^2 times square root of one
minus x^2.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
So, actually,
that's also,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
so, in fact,
that simplifies to two thirds

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000
of one minus x^2 to the three
halves.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000
OK, let me redo that,
maybe, slightly differently.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:50.000
This was one minus x^2 times y.
So -- -- one minus x^2 times y

00:34:50.000 --> 00:35:02.000
becomes square root of one minus
x^2 minus y^3 over three.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
And then, when I take y equals
zero, I get zero.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000
So, I don't subtract anything.
OK, so now you see this is one

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.000
minus x^2 to the three halves
minus a third of it.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:21.000
So, you're left with two thirds.
OK, so, that's the integral.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000
The outer integral is the
integral from zero to one of two

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000
thirds of one minus x^2 to the
three halves dx.

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
And,
well,

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
I let you see if you remember
single variable integrals by

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
trying to figure out what this
actually comes out to be is it

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:54.000
pi over two,
or pi over eight, actually?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:36:12.000
I think it's pi over eight.
OK, well I guess we have to do

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
it then.
I wrote something on my notes,

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000
but it's not very clear,
OK?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
So, how do we compute this
thing?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Well, we have to do trig
substitution.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
That's the only way I know to
compute an integral like that,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
OK?
So, we'll set x equal sine

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000
theta, and then square root of
one minus x^2 will be cosine

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
theta.
We are using sine squared plus

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:51.000
cosine squared equals one.
And, so that will become -- --

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:59.000
so, two thirds remains two
thirds.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
One minus x^2 to the three
halves becomes cosine cubed

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:08.000
theta.
dx, well, if x is sine theta,

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:13.000
then dx is cosine theta d
theta.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
So, that's cosine theta d theta.
And,

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
well, if you do things with
substitution,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
which is the way I do them,
then you should worry about the

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
bounds for theta which will be
zero to pi over two.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Or, you can also just plug in
the bounds at the end.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000
So, now you have the two thirds
times the integral from zero to

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:41.000
pi over two of cosine to the
fourth theta d theta.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:48.000
And, how do you integrate that?
Well, you have to use double

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:55.000
angle formulas.
OK, so cosine to the fourth,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:02.000
remember, cosine squared theta
is one plus cosine two theta

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:14.000
over two.
And, we want the square of that.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:23.000
And,
so that will give us -- -- of,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:29.000
well, we'll have,
it's actually one quarter plus

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:37.000
one half cosine to theta plus
one quarter cosine square to

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000
theta d theta.
And, how will you handle this

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000
guy?
Well, using,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000
again, the double angle
formula.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:51.000
OK, so it's getting slightly
nasty.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
So, but I don't know any
simpler solution except for one

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
simpler solution,
which is you have a table of

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
integrals of this form inside
the notes.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Yes?
No, I don't think so because if

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
you take one half times cosine
half times two,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:15.000
you will still have half,
OK?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:18.000
So, if you do,
again, the double angle

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000
formula, I think I'm not going
to bother to do it.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:37.000
I claim you will get,
at the end, pi over eight

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:46.000
because I say so.
OK, so exercise,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:54.000
continue calculating and get pi
over eight.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.000
OK, now what does the show us?
Well, this shows us,

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
actually, that this is probably
not the right way to do this.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
OK, the right way to do this
will be to integrate it in polar

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
coordinates.
And, that's what we will learn

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
how to do tomorrow.
So, we will actually see how to

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
do it with much less trig.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:46.000
So, that will be easier in
polar coordinates.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:51.000
So, we will see that tomorrow.
OK, so we are almost there.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
I mean, here you just use a
double angle again and then you

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
can get it.
And, it's pretty

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:00.000
straightforward.
OK, so one thing that's kind of

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:07.000
interesting to know is we can
exchange the order of

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
integration.
Say we have an integral given

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
to us in the order dy dx,
we can switch it to dx dy.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
But, we have to be extremely
careful with the bounds.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
So, you certainly cannot just
swap the bounds of the inner and

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
outer because there you would
end up having this square root

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
of one minus x^2 on the outside,
and you would never get a

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
number out of that.
So, that cannot work.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
It's more complicated than that.
OK, so, well,

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.000
here's a first baby example.
Certainly, if I do integral

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
from zero to one,
integral from zero to two dx

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
dy, there, I can certainly
switch the bounds without

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000
thinking too much.
What's the reason for that?

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Well, the reason for that is
this corresponds in both cases

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:04.000
to integrating x from zero to
two, and y from zero to one.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
It's a rectangle.
So, if I slice it this way,

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:11.000
you see that y goes from zero
to one for any x between zero

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
and two.
It's this guy.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000
If I slice it that way,
then x goes from zero to two

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
for any value of y between zero
and one.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.000
And, it's this one.
So, here it works.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
But in general,
I have to draw picture of my

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000
region, and see how the slices
look like both ways.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:41.000
OK, so let's do a more
interesting one.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Let's say that I want to
compute an integral from zero to

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:55.000
one of integral from x to square
root of x of e^y over y dy dx.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000
So, why did I choose this guy?
Which is the guy because as far

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000
as I can tell,
there's no way to integrate e^y

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000
over y.
So, this is an integral that

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
you cannot compute this way.
So, it's a good example for why

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
this can be useful.
So, if you do it this way,

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
you are stuck immediately.
So, instead,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
we will try to switch the
order.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:20.000
But, to switch the order,
we have to understand,

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000
what do these bounds mean?
OK, so let's draw a picture of

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000
the region.
Well what I am saying is y

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000
equals x to y equals square root
of x.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Well, let's draw y equals x,
and y equals square root of x.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Well, maybe I should actually
put this here,

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000
y equals x to y equals square
root of x.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.000
OK, and so I will go,
for each value of x I will go

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:07.000
from y equals xo to y equals
square root of x.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:11.000
And then, we'll do that for
values of x that go from x

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.000
equals zero to x equals one,
which happens to be exactly

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:22.000
where these things intersect.
So, my region will consist of

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
all this, OK?
So now, if I want to do it the

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
other way around,
I have to decompose my region.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
The other way around,
I have to, so my goal,

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
now, is to rewrite this as an
integral.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Well, it's still the same
function.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
It's still e to the y over y.
But now, I want to integrate dx

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
dy.
So, how do I integrate over x?

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
Well, I fix a value of y.
And, for that value of y,

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
what's the range of x?
Well, the range for x is from

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.000
here to here.
OK, what's the value of x here?

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Let's start with an easy one.
This is x equals y.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000
What about this one?
It's x equals y^2.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:16.000
OK, so, x goes from y2 to y,
and then what about y?

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Well, I have to start at the
bottom of my region.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000
That's y equals zero to the
top, which is at y equals one.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:31.000
So, y goes from zero to one.
So, switching the bounds is not

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:36.000
completely obvious.
That took a little bit of work.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
But now that we've done that,
well,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
just to see how it goes,
it's actually going to be much

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
easier to integrate because the
inner integral,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
well, what's the integral of
e^y over y with respect to x?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:46:01.000
It's just that times x,
right, from x equals y^2 to y.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
So, that will be,
well, if I plug x equals y,

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
I will get e to the y minus,
if I plug x equals y^2,

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.000
I will get e to the y over y
times y^2 into the y times y,

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
OK?
So, now, if I do the outer

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:27.000
integral, I will have the
integral from zero to one of e

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.000
to the y minus y^e to the y dy.
And, that one actually is a

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
little bit easier.
So, we know how to integrate

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
e^y.
We don't quite know how to

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000
integrate ye^y.
But, let's try.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000
So, let's see,
what's the derivative of ye^y?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Well, there's a product rule
that's one times e^y plus y

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
times the derivative of e^y is
ye^y.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
So, if we do,
OK, let's put a minus sign in

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000
front.
Well, that's almost what we

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.000
want, except we have a minus e^y
instead of a plus e^y.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:15.000
So, we need to add 2e^y.
And, I claim that's the

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000
antiderivative.
OK, if you got lost,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000
you can also integrate by
integrating by parts,

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
by taking the derivative of y
and integrating these guys.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000
Or, but, you know, that works.
Just, your first guess would

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
be, maybe, let's try minus y^e
to the y.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Take the derivative of that,
compare, see what you need to

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
do to fix.
And so, if you take that

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:45.000
between zero and one,
you'll actually get e minus

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
two.
OK,

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:50.000
so,
tomorrow we are going to see

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.000
how to do double integrals in
polar coordinates,

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
and also applications of double
integrals,

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
how to use them for interesting
things.

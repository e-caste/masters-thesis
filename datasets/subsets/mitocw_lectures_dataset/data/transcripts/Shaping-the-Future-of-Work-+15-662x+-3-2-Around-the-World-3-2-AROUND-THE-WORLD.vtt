00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.980
I am [INAUDIBLE] Khan, and I'm
doing a Ph.D. At MIT Sloan.

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.480
Prior to starting the Ph.D.,
I worked as a policy advisor

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.330
with the Dutch
government and Bangladesh

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.740
between 2013 and '15.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.970
During the course of my
work, I interacted with many

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.530
stakeholders working on
occupational safety and health

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.200
issues at the workplace
and workers' rights,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.800
particularly in the
Bangladeshi textile sector.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.220
Amongst the stakeholders,
was Miss Nazma Akter

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.270
a prominent member of the
Bangladesh labor movement.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.970
In a sector that is
largely dominated by men,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.010
she stands out as the country's
most respected and influential

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.660
female labor leader.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.610
She began her working life
at the tender age of 11,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.880
in a small garment
factory in Dhaka.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.670
As she grew older, she
started to speak out

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.760
against the injustices
at the workplace.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.700
For this, she often
faced brutality

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.750
from thugs hired by the factory
managers, and even the police.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.990
She eventually
left the workforce,

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.560
and went on to starting
the AWAJ Foundation

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.390
with some other coworkers.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.650
AWAJ Foundation
is an organization

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.860
which fights for workers'
rights and helps settle

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.170
worker disputes in factories.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.190
The organization has
been active in mediating

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.800
numerous activities on
wages, overtime, holidays,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.360
and maternity
leave in factories.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.440
Despite the hardships of
working in the garment sector,

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.310
Miss Akbar is not against
garment factories,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.350
which she believes empower
women by giving them

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.570
greater choice and opportunity.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.350
However, she is
resolutely against

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.190
exploitative and dangerous
working practices,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.210
and strives to ensure that
women get treated fairly.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.050
I had the opportunity
to speak with her,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.930
in Bangladesh in January 2016
on a number of current issues

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.580
facing the Bangladesh
labor movement.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.500
As a worker in
Bangladesh, Ms. Akter

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.250
is vocal on the subject of the
exploitation of cheap labor

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.039
by the first oil companies.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.380
And eloquently puts
forth the conflict

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.120
between the vested
interests groups

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.980
and Bangladeshi workers
in the factories.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.210
Thank you to MIT to
give me the opportunity.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.100
As you know, the most of
the production country

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.340
where producing the garments
is the buyers an international

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.510
and fresh and original.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.260
They're coming to me
because of the cheap labor.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.580
Especially the Bangladesh is
the cheapest all over the world.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.910
So that means that globally,
people are addressing us.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.310
[INAUDIBLE] and pull and pull.

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.420
So, if you're addressing
this kind of world,

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.290
there is no human interaction,
there is no worker [INAUDIBLE],

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.370
there is not decent
working conditions.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.140
This is the global
problem who is created

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.180
by the global people and
global business community

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.860
and the legislation.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.230
So that need to be addressed.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.560
How people have to get the
decent working condition.

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.540
A decent working condition.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.760
Living condition.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.190
Because that is very
needed to for us.

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.550
And in many cases the
Bangladeshi and other branches,

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.940
the business people are so
powerful in the parliament,

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.840
in the government.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.130
Also, they're highly educated.

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.500
That is the problem with this.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.340
The politics is always
favored for the big business.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.160
Secularism and globalization
is a big, bad impact

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.510
for the general people and
for the working people.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.740
So how we have to
get the equal rights.

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.820
And we have to be thinking
about the respect and dignity.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.330
Not only the profit and profile.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.560
Because capitalism
has only two results.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.930
One is profit.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.410
Another is the control.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.840
So they have both,
and we are hungry.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.170
So we need to stop the hunger.

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:57.960
And we need to be decent.

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.560
And ensure the nutrition.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.930
She goes on to elaborate on
the specific challenges she

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.590
faced in her work, and the kind
of disputes she has observed.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.300
As you know, the workers
has main fundamental right

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.420
to collective bargaining
that negotiation

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:18.490
and the union right.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.210
Which is very challenges
and difficult for us,

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.950
because when the workers
are organize the union,

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.780
most of the case there
are finding that union

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.960
busting from the men is meant.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.232
As is the local politician,
and local people.

00:04:35.232 --> 00:04:37.440
And their fear, they're
given threat, they're beaten,

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.490
they're given the different
types of pressure, and abuse.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.910
And they file a false case.

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.840
And this is very
difficult to organize.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.550
And as activist, and leader, we
are also facing problem also.

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.040
With as many cases as I told
before, [INAUDIBLE] powerful,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.940
and they also the
only ones that's

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.950
involved in the
parliament and the power.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.110
So that kind of
difficulty we are facing.

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.000
In many cases,
they're so difficult,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.490
and challenges many
workers are the facing.

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.910
They are also--

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.660
[INAUDIBLE] one or
two countries safe

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.510
again, because it's very
threatened what they're like.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.340
So, these are the challenges
we need to ensure.

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.810
And corruption is it
one of the big problems,

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.280
and government is not serious
about the workers issues,

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.880
than the business profit.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.870
So we want to build
a relationship

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:41.610
and worker-management
dialogue in same platform.

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.780
It will be helpful for
the productivity, as well

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.720
as the workers' happiness.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.480
So if that begin, the
sustainable development

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.160
comes after.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.860
We built one part,
only the manufacturer

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.330
are taking their own
decision, their won things.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.440
It will not work, because
the manufacturer always

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.700
want [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.700
Maximum things, like when we are
asking for the workers benefit.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.560
That is honest minimal things.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.980
So how we have to
get the maximum.

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.280
And how we to get that.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.120
The Rana Plaza incident,
where over 1,100 workers

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.100
died when their
factory collapsed,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.980
resulted in many initiatives--

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.020
both within
Bangladesh, and abroad.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.040
And money poured in
from many sectors.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.000
When I asked her what she
thought of those initiatives,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.430
she was skeptical.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.100
She also had high
expectations from the meeting

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.810
of the sustainability compact
held in Bangladesh in 2016.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:43.830
The compact was an agreement
signed between the governments

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.970
of Bangladesh, the
EU, and the US,

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.630
following the Rana
Plaza collapse,

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.670
in an effort to improve
working conditions

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:53.190
in the textile sector.

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:56.720
After Rana Plaza collapse,
lots of initiating

00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:00.100
taken by Bangladesh,
and all the world.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.300
It is so many meeting,
so many seminars,

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.460
so many things agreeing, and so
many funded and support we got.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.600
But the real things, and
real effort was not done.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.290
Many cases, we found many
days is not that much.

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:22.240
So our request, the money should
be utilized the right person,

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.720
workers as the industry.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:26.310
But in many cases,
it's not working.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:29.250
In many cases, found
is like an eyewash

00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.190
or trying to be
useful in this use.

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:38.100
As you know, the third
Compact Sustainability meeting

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:42.020
will be held on 28th of
January, Dhaka, Bangladesh.

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.100
We are expecting-- to
the Compact meeting--

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.790
the Bangladesh
government, and you'll

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:51.540
get an American delegate.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:54.580
Already you know the
sustainable development goals.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.100
There are 17 goals.

00:07:56.100 --> 00:07:58.630
The goal number 8
is a decent one.

00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:01.410
So we wanted the decent
ones-- addressing

00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:02.750
and how to implement.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.860
And we want to be living with--
we want freedom of association

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:09.400
and fundamental rights.

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.650
And we want better
workers-management relations.

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:14.760
And people are very poor--

00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.480
want a better living condition,
as in these safety issues.

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.320
When I asked her
about how to improve

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:25.240
worker-employer relations,
she had important insights

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:28.980
about how to build relationships
that benefit both parties.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:33.190
If we really want a functional
workers-management relation,

00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.909
that is--

00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:38.960
that part, we need to
educate all of them.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.880
And also we need to create a
workers-management relation

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.710
culture, because that
is the big problem.

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:50.100
And management needs
to be positive thinking

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.150
and positive way to
accept the issues.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.940
Because always they are
thinking we are invested--

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.490
we are not listening to anyone.

00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:01.100
The workers have
to be listening.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.060
So that type of culture
and motivation--

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:08.750
also need, as the global
suppliers and the buyer

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:12.600
have also responsibility to
ensure these kind of things.

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.430
But in many cases we
found they are absent.

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:19.400
So everybody needs to
be working together.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.170
As the workers representative,
we need a constructive union.

00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:25.450
And also management
has to be constructive,

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:26.820
as does the buyer.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.900
So-- and government should
be supporting all of them.

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.110
I think this way
we can overcome.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:38.590
If there was one party to
initiate it, it will not work.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:40.910
She ends with a strong
message to the new generation

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.700
in the West--

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.180
the current and future
consumers of textiles,

00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:46.960
who will play an important
role in determining the future

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.070
of global supply patterns.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:55.080
As you know, most of the goods
are produced by the young boys

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:55.930
and girls.

00:09:55.930 --> 00:10:01.650
And that is the important
issue, because they

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.680
don't get proper education
and proper food and nutrition.

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.020
That is why they need
to be voluntarily

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:11.280
early retirements because
of the malnutrition

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.730
and high production pressure.

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:16.340
My request to all
the young consumers

00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:18.820
who will be the next
generation leaders

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:21.630
of taking that responsibility--

00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:25.820
you have to respect your
young friends and colleagues

00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:28.480
who are working
in Bangladesh, how

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:30.810
to ensure their [INAUDIBLE]
end of their life,

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:34.240
and workplace safety
and other issues.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.860
Because the young
generation can take

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.150
all that initiating, because
you are the consumer.

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.210
And you are the right people.

00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:47.580
So please try to be ensured
and while carefully to safe

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.030
working conditions and
decent living conditions.

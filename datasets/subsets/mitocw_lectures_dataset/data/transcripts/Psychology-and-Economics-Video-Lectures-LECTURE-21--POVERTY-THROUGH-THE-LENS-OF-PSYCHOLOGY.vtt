00:00:09.485 --> 00:00:11.110
FRANK SCHILBACH: All
right, so welcome.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.410
This is lecture 21 of 14.13.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.660
We're going to talk
about poverty, as seen

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.740
through the lens of psychology.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.910
What are we going to do?

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:23.950
I'm going to give you
some broad overview.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.820
We're going to particularly
talk about this work on scarcity

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.720
by Mani et al., which is
the idea that thinking--

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.020
our thoughts about poverty
captures people's minds, which

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.020
in turn leaves less
capacity in people's minds

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.280
to do other things.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:41.200
And then we're going
to talk a little bit

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.270
at the end, at least briefly,
about other deprivations

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.900
that poverty entails.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.070
Some of this is
what I have done.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.040
Some of this work by others.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.250
So I want to start with
a simple observation that

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.690
is sort of at the heart of
a lot of this literature.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.932
And the observation is that when
you look around in the world

00:01:06.932 --> 00:01:08.390
and look for
evidence, and when you

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.570
work on poverty-related
issues, you'll

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.700
see or observe quite a few
seemingly suboptimal behaviors

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.020
among the poor.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.160
This would be things like
lack of investment or taking

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.800
advantage of high return
investment opportunities.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.470
This would be like investment
in fertilizer or health

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.560
investments or machines
or low savings,

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.020
in particular some things
like precautionary savings,

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.350
like being ready for shocks,
saving for the future,

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.460
for retirement, and so on.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.330
At the same time,
sort of high return

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.000
or high interest
rate credit, people

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.490
take very high interest loans.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.920
In part-- what I've shown
you earlier in the class,

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460
that's particularly
prevalent among the poor.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.990
There's some evidence of
worse performance of parenting

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.870
among poor parents, including
things like violence

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.810
against children and so on.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.630
There is some evidence of lower
productivity, punctuality,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.410
lower medical
adherence for drugs

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.750
that are sort of even very
high stakes drugs that

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.430
are lifesaving.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.810
There's some evidence of
food and drug consumptions

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.950
in terms of healthy
eating or excessive drug

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.940
use and the like.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.510
All of those things tend to be
correlated one way or the other

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.890
with different forms
of income or poverty.

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.480
So now you might say, well
that's interesting, but now

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.780
what explains these behaviors?

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.960
How do we think about this?

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.510
What [AUDIO OUT] plausible
explanation kinds

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.000
of autocorrelations.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.920
To be very clear, these
are correlations, not

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.438
causal effects.

00:02:58.438 --> 00:03:00.730
So education could explain
quite a few of those things.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.910
It could explain
potentially productivity

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.170
and it could explain
potentially parenting

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.690
and it could explain some
form of financial investments.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.300
It could also explain things
like medical insurance.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:20.060
For example, if you look
at in some settings where

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.110
people have not sort
of learned in school

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.277
any basics of medicine or
biology and so on and sort of

00:03:27.277 --> 00:03:29.360
and it's not obvious that
you should take medicine

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.580
from a traditional doctor
versus from some healer

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:33.913
in the village, because how
would you know what's better

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:34.628
and what's worse.

00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:36.420
And sort of presumably
some of these things

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.820
you would learn in school.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.210
So one broad
explanatory factor is

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.330
sort of like, [INAUDIBLE]
variables if you want,

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.860
and one of them is
potentially education.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.710
It's not about omitted variable.

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:54.900
This is about a treatment
effect of poverty itself.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.890
And I'm going to be more
specific about that.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.615
But essentially it's something
about being in poverty itself

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:01.740
affects people's behaviors.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.047
So it causes them--

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:05.880
some of these outcomes,
some of these things

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.810
that we've seen here.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.480
We'll talk about that in detail,
but that's exactly right.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.260
In some ways, people
would say, even for--

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.520
if you take credit for
example, or for some things,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.712
you probably can't explain.

00:04:17.712 --> 00:04:19.170
But for high return
investment, you

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.670
would say, while
there's uncertainty

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.620
and there's a good chance
that there might be losses

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.210
at the end of the
day, and if you're

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.210
really close to
subsistence, you might not

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.290
want to invest in stocks,
because if a bad shock happens,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:33.055
that's really bad.

00:04:33.055 --> 00:04:34.430
So I think some
of that is right.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.625
And punctuality, for
example, could also

00:04:37.625 --> 00:04:38.750
be in some way uncertainty.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.820
It's like you try to
take a bus to work

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.570
and the bus just
comes every hour,

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.570
and then sometimes it
comes a half an hour early

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:45.778
and sometimes it comes later.

00:04:45.778 --> 00:04:48.110
And it's really hard to
be actually punctual.

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:50.840
Could just be some
people are not productive

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.460
and are just bad at doing stuff.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.340
And therefore, they
become poor and then

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.555
they end up being
poor because of that.

00:04:57.555 --> 00:04:59.180
So that's essentially,
I think, that we

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.472
covered pretty much everything.

00:05:00.472 --> 00:05:03.170
So one is it could be sort of
environmental conditions, which

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.230
is transportation, it's really
hard to get to work on time,

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.970
or have the community
for two hours

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:10.730
and then you're really tired and
that makes you less productive.

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.440
Things like predatory
lending sort

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.630
of tricks you into lending.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.240
There could some some things
about institutional structures,

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.900
which is to say, I told
you for example at MIT,

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.510
there's a default--

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.340
or at other places,
there's defaults

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.690
for people to save money.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.880
And there's a default
to get health insurance.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.550
And there's defaults for
all sorts of good behaviors,

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:36.470
like for vaccinations
and so on and so forth.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.850
We are sort of essentially
pushed by society,

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:40.820
by the environmental
conditions that we

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.032
face into doing the right thing
or whatever good behaviors,

00:05:44.032 --> 00:05:45.240
whatever you want to call it.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.650
And so the poor might just
not have those things.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.210
So for example,
having a bank account

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:55.558
might be like if you paid
daily or you can buy by trip.

00:05:55.558 --> 00:05:57.350
The rickshaw drivers
that I was showing you

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.900
earlier in the semester,
they paid trip by trip

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.960
and then they'd pass
by the liquor stores,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.738
essentially daily, and have
a bunch of cash on hand.

00:06:05.738 --> 00:06:08.280
Well, that's much trickier to
sort of resist sometimes, since

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.180
if you were particularly
also prone to physical pain,

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.790
and then sort of to
use alcohol as a way

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.650
to deal with your physical pain.

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.950
As opposed to somebody who paid
monthly and half of the money

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.250
goes into the rent anyway and
then other expenses and so on,

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.993
which is much easier to manage.

00:06:23.993 --> 00:06:25.910
So that's kind of broadly
I would summarize it

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:28.500
as environmental conditions.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.170
Then there's selection
and omitted variables,

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.480
which is, I think Joseph
has mentioned education,

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.170
which is a very good one.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.790
There's things
like intelligence,

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.160
talent, effort,
mistakes, and so on.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.850
You might say, well, if you
are more prone-- if you're

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.560
less productive, for example, if
you're prone to making mistakes

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.860
and so on, well
that sort of leads

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.610
to worse outcomes and that
makes you end up being poor.

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.530
And that's really sort of
in some sense, a right wing

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.665
kind of view, that people are--

00:06:59.665 --> 00:07:01.290
they should do whatever
they want to do

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.380
and if the end of being poor,
it's sort of their fault,

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.030
and so on.

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.430
That's of course not what
we're going to argue here.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:08.600
What we're interested
in-- or what

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.225
I'm trying to argue [AUDIO OUT]
show you some evidence off this

00:07:11.225 --> 00:07:15.770
that there's a treatment effect
of poverty itself potentially.

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.420
Which is to say that being poor
itself causes these behaviors.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.240
And again, I'll show you
the evidence in two ways.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:28.190
One is by inducing
thoughts about money,

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:31.220
essentially thinking about
can you pay school fees,

00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.860
can pay your rent, can you get
groceries for your children,

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:36.360
are your children are going to
be hungry tonight, and so on.

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:38.120
These are all kind of
thoughts that invade

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.610
people's minds involuntarily.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:44.150
And by doing so, they
capture people's attention.

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.090
And then since attention
overall is limited,

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.660
people have less attention
available for other things.

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.120
That's sort of one broad theory.

00:07:55.120 --> 00:08:00.520
And I'll focus on
that mostly which

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.040
people refer to it under
the name of scarcity.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.250
And then there's a bunch
of other aspects of poverty

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.950
as well that might be
competing with people's

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.370
cognitive function, their
attention, that tire them out.

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.840
They're just not sleeping
well, be in pain, being exposed

00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.250
to pollution, environmental
pollution, noise pollution,

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:23.630
and so on, and so forth.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.045
And so now what's the
underlying idea here?

00:08:27.045 --> 00:08:28.920
Well again, the underlying
idea is that there

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.240
might be what's called--

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.605
people might want to call
it behavioral poverty trap.

00:08:33.605 --> 00:08:34.980
And the broad line
of argument is

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.679
that poverty affects people's
cognition, decision making,

00:08:37.679 --> 00:08:38.909
or productivity.

00:08:38.909 --> 00:08:41.370
These factors in
turn then influence

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:45.180
people's future poverty,
because if you're not productive

00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:46.680
and you can't save
money and so on,

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.020
you're going to be more
poor in the future.

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.640
And if those things
are going on,

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:54.330
there is essentially some form
of a vicious cycle going on,

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:57.490
which makes it difficult,
if not impossible,

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.370
for a person to become rich.

00:08:59.370 --> 00:09:02.428
Now notice at the very least,
that will lower mobility.

00:09:02.428 --> 00:09:04.720
Sometimes if you're poor and
you want to become richer,

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.637
you have got to deal
with a bunch of bad stuff

00:09:06.637 --> 00:09:10.260
that happens to you every day.

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.340
But [INAUDIBLE] mobility is low,
[INAUDIBLE] might be actually

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.840
a trap.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.190
It's just next to or actually
impossible to become richer,

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:21.690
because all these forces are too
strong to overcome for people.

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:24.610
So today I'm going to talk about
two broad lines of research.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:27.480
I'm going to focus mostly
on the first one, which

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:30.763
is monetary concerns capture
people's cognitive function.

00:09:30.763 --> 00:09:33.180
I'm going to talk a little bit
about other poverty-induced

00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:35.460
deprivation of behaviors
which might have sort

00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:39.180
of similar effects overall.

00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:43.780
So now I want to do a
simple test with you.

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:47.970
So what I'd like
you to do is to--

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:49.530
sorry, one second.

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:52.750
I'm trying to-- give me a sec.

00:09:52.750 --> 00:09:54.418
I'd like you to--

00:09:54.418 --> 00:09:55.210
hold on one second.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.224
One second.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:00.400
All right.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.710
Ready?

00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:01.850
Don't write anything down.

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:05.660
Just try to remember it and
then try to recall it in a bit.

00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:07.230
I'm going to start reading.

00:10:07.230 --> 00:10:17.880
Bed, rest, dream, doze, snore,
slumber, blanket, snooze, wake,

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.565
nap, awake, tired.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.950
OK, now please write down as
many words as you remember.

00:11:08.853 --> 00:11:09.520
10 more seconds.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:24.830
All right, so done.

00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:27.948
So usually I would have people
raise their hands, which

00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:28.740
is a little tricky.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.750
But I'm going to just
read you the list of words

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.708
and you can nod to me--

00:11:31.708 --> 00:11:33.060
I can see some of you, at least.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:34.518
You can nod and
tell me whether you

00:11:34.518 --> 00:11:40.082
remember the words that I read.

00:11:40.082 --> 00:11:41.040
OK, I'm going to start.

00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:47.160
Bed, rest-- pretty good--

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:57.460
dream, doze, snore-- no?

00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:15.700
Slumber, sleep, blanket,
snooze, wake, nap, awake, tired.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:20.840
So I know this is
making everybody sleepy

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.420
and want to take a nap.

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:23.350
Me, too.

00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:27.650
So here's the list of words
that I asked you to remember.

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.003
Now one thing
that's kind of nice

00:12:30.003 --> 00:12:33.680
[INAUDIBLE] most people
remembered quite a few things.

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.180
The majority, for
example, remembers

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:37.320
bed and so on and so forth.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.100
Now what's quite interesting
about these words is

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.930
that while I remember--

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.550
I put all these
names up here, which

00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:46.550
is-- these are the words
that I actually read.

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:48.830
Now one word that's actually
missing in this list

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:51.350
here is sleep.

00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:53.240
And so you sort of--

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.780
I snuck this in here on--

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:58.700
this is why I had to go back.

00:12:58.700 --> 00:13:00.920
It turns out I actually
didn't read the word sleep,

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.410
but quite a few of you
were nodding happily

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:05.090
when I asked you about sleep.

00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:09.960
And what's the reason
why you remembered sleep?

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.180
So all of these words is like--

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.640
they all around sleep.

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.360
So it's really like sleep
should have been there.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.860
It's kind of the
type of thing where

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:25.250
people would ask you, have you
been to the parity last week,

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:27.950
where people just assume-- where
essentially all of the friends

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:29.750
were there-- people just
assume that you were there,

00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:31.610
as well, because you're
supposed to be there.

00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.320
It's like sleep is supposed
to be in this list,

00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.445
but we didn't put it there.

00:13:34.445 --> 00:13:36.800
And this is what is
called false memory tests.

00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:39.258
And there's quite a bit of work
on actually false memories.

00:13:39.258 --> 00:13:41.420
And people's minds
essentially make up things.

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:43.130
In particular, stuff
that's sort of--

00:13:43.130 --> 00:13:46.670
or where you have all
situations that you think

00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:47.960
that should be the case.

00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:52.730
You can do the same with man
and other lists and so on.

00:13:52.730 --> 00:13:56.330
And now psychologists
have been doing studies

00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:57.710
for the rich and the poor.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.000
And so here's two lists.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.470
One is about sort of
money-related stuff.

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:05.660
And one is about sort of just
anything that's related to,

00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.133
I guess, man or
gender in some ways.

00:14:09.133 --> 00:14:10.550
And they looked
at how many people

00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.160
have certain false memory.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.910
And what these studies
show is essentially

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:16.880
that when you take
this list for a man

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:21.590
and you do this with high
income and low income people,

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:27.890
the fraction who remember a man
wrongly is about 15% to 20%.

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.730
The fraction among the
poor who remember money

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:33.800
is similarly high.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.590
Among the rich,
that's not the case.

00:14:36.590 --> 00:14:37.340
Now why is that?

00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:40.400
Well, it seems to be that for
the poor, when you read lists

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.890
like groceries,
expense, bill, gas, et

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:44.830
cetera, what they think
about is essentially,

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.080
how I'm going to pay for this.

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.020
And they think about money.

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:50.330
When for the rich,

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:52.368
Instead, when you say
groceries or whatever,

00:14:52.368 --> 00:14:54.410
they think about what I'm
going to buy for dinner

00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:56.285
and what are the nice
things I'm going to do.

00:14:56.285 --> 00:14:58.502
And for them, this is
really not top of mind.

00:14:58.502 --> 00:15:00.710
So this is essentially at
least one piece of evidence

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:05.390
that money captures the
minds of the poor moreso

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:08.400
than for the rich.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:13.060
Now, a second study is a study
about the doctor's visit.

00:15:13.060 --> 00:15:17.460
So this is a study where
the participants were

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:19.410
asked about the following
situation, which

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:22.260
is imagine that you have
been feeling sick lately

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.640
and finally decided to
go see a doctor about it.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.090
The doctor explains that you
have a serious condition that

00:15:27.090 --> 00:15:28.770
requires immediate attention.

00:15:28.770 --> 00:15:31.530
The good news, however, is
you are virtually guaranteed

00:15:31.530 --> 00:15:32.940
to make a full recovery.

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:34.710
The doctor writes
several prescriptions.

00:15:34.710 --> 00:15:38.000
You will also need to
make several appointments.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.040
What would be on your
mind or how would you feel

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:42.750
about when you hear this news?

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:45.930
What are the three things
that you think about it?

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:47.813
Or you can think about
for a second what

00:15:47.813 --> 00:15:49.980
is it that you would feel,
and what are you thinking

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:52.080
about when you see this.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:53.970
And what's particularly
interesting

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:56.890
is how when you look
at people's responses

00:15:56.890 --> 00:16:01.440
some people say
wife, son, co-worker.

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.330
Some people are scared, afraid,
worried, relief, hope, joy,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:11.850
so like emotions or just of
relationships and other people.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:13.860
Not exactly sure what the
co-workers doing there

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:19.380
but anyway, but what's
particularly interesting

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.360
is the fraction of
people who say costs.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:27.540
And as you can imagine, when you
do this by low and high income

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:34.050
when you think about medical
conditions for the rich,

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.470
this is much more about
emotions about their health,

00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:40.810
about their relationships,
their loved ones, and so on.

00:16:40.810 --> 00:16:44.310
And when the poor think about
health or health expenditures

00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:46.350
or health issues,
they think very much

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.630
about health expenditures,
and that is essentially

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:51.070
what's top of mind for them.

00:16:51.070 --> 00:16:53.700
And so again, when you split the
sample by low and high income

00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:58.080
people, the poor have much
higher proportions of money

00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:01.890
really good thoughts as reported
by these kinds of questions

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:03.240
compared to the rich.

00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:06.651
The third study-- the last
thing I'm going to show you

00:17:06.651 --> 00:17:08.109
is the study that
I showed you very

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:11.560
much at the beginning of the
class, which was a study about

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:14.990
imagine you are about to
purchase an iPad for $500.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:18.670
The salesman says you can get
the same iPad, exact same iPad

00:17:18.670 --> 00:17:20.260
for $15 off.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.800
Would you walk for 30
minutes in total for $15.

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.273
Would you go for
the other store?

00:17:25.273 --> 00:17:27.190
And similarly, you'd
have to do the same thing

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:28.760
for an iPad case.

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.000
And so the result that
we found in this class

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.560
and like the other
studies have found

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.900
is that people are way
more likely to report

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.740
that they would walk for the
iPad than for the iPad itself.

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:41.320
And the explanation,
of course, is

00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:45.340
that people evaluate things
in relative terms, right.

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:46.840
So if you think
about the iPad case,

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.870
$15 is really high
relative to like

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:54.700
$30 in the iPad cases of value,
while for the iPad itself,

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.960
$15 compared to $500
is not very much.

00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:01.420
Now that's some form
of money illusion

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:03.820
or some form of community
confusion or the like,

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.440
because at the
end of the day you

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.920
should just be willing to walk
for 30 minutes for either $15

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.610
or not.

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:11.860
That's not going to change
depending on whether you

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.200
buy an iPad or an iPad case.

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.740
Now many studies have
found the kind of patterns

00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:21.130
including like in this
class, but once you

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:23.020
do that with the poor,
they're much less

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:26.400
likely if at all to engage in
this kind of behavior, which

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.380
seems to suggest that
the poor, in fact,

00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.870
are less prone to this, kind
of, labeling or, sort of,

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.710
like monetary sort
of comparisions.

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:36.572
For them essentially
$1 is $1 and they,

00:18:36.572 --> 00:18:38.030
sort of, understand
that, like, $15

00:18:38.030 --> 00:18:42.660
is valuable regardless of what
is surrounding comparisons

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:43.857
like.

00:18:43.857 --> 00:18:45.940
And so if I have to summarize
what I've just shown

00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:49.330
you very quickly is that
thoughts about money

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.530
tend to capture or take much
more space in the poor's minds

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:56.200
instead of the first two
studies that I showed you,

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.060
and second, the
extra focus on money

00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:01.120
has actually some positive
consequences in some sense.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.090
In some sense, you can say here
this is an irrational decision

00:19:04.090 --> 00:19:07.840
to say, yes, that you
will go for the iPad case

00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:12.230
compared to the iPad or some
of this optimization going on.

00:19:12.230 --> 00:19:14.590
So the poor are actually
doing better or the less prone

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.280
to these kinds of errors
compared to the rich.

00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.440
I think that's a good
thing for like potentially

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.020
better monetary decisions here.

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.330
So there's some
positive consequences

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.680
for impacts based on that.

00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.440
now, and this is where
we're going to go, is,

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.050
well, are there also some
negative effects potentially?

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:37.930
The reason being that if
you have a certain amount

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:40.600
of attention available
overall, or cognitive resources

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.240
available, if your
brain is taken up

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.680
by essentially these
thoughts about money,

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.380
then there will be less
available resources

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.310
for other stuff.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:55.398
Any questions on this so far?

00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:10.240
OK, so then let's talk about
the scarcity work specifically.

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:13.050
So scarcity is actually
defined generally here

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.660
as not having
enough of something.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:19.150
This could be money, friends,
hair, time, et cetera.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:21.420
It's very general, actually.

00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.010
And so the idea is
just like if you

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:25.280
have something that you
think you don't have enough.

00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.780
Notice that the definition is
pretty vague in the sense that

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.773
like it's not just saying
like having low income,

00:20:30.773 --> 00:20:32.190
but it's sort of
thinking that you

00:20:32.190 --> 00:20:34.080
don't have enough income,
which could be also

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:36.290
like in relative
terms and so on.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:40.160
And then the hypothesis
is that scarcity captured

00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.670
people's mental cognitive
capacity, their bandwidth,

00:20:43.670 --> 00:20:44.960
as they call it.

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.645
This happens automatically
and not intentionally.

00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:49.520
That is to say, that
it's not people choosing

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:52.860
to spend a lot of time
on thinking about money,

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:55.920
but rather, money
captures their minds,

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.383
and then they have trouble
thinking about other things.

00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:00.800
Think about this
as like, it would

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.710
be like suppose you
have like some fights

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:06.440
with a good friend of yours,
or a partner or the like,

00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.120
and then you have an
important job interview.

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.730
It's really not
productive to think

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:16.280
about the fight with your
friend or family member

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:17.545
or partner or the like.

00:21:17.545 --> 00:21:18.920
During the job
interview, there's

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.520
nothing productive
about doing that.

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:22.145
You should be focusing
on the interview

00:21:22.145 --> 00:21:23.220
and try to do your best.

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.520
But it might be that like
essentially, these thoughts

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.560
invade your minds and
you sort of get really

00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.810
distracted
unintentionally, and then

00:21:29.810 --> 00:21:32.030
do worse in those kinds of--

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:34.460
And that's the idea
here similarly here

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:38.500
as well, which is that
essentially, there

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.690
might be some benefit of
figuring out monetary problems

00:21:41.690 --> 00:21:44.250
and figuring out how to pay the
bills and so on and so forth.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:47.630
But overall, these
benefits might

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:53.030
be overwhelmed by taking
over people's brain

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:59.010
that leaves less resources for
other things, the decisions

00:21:59.010 --> 00:22:02.800
or productivity that
people have to do in life.

00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:05.950
And so in particular,
poverty now, so this

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:07.420
is a general introduction.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.840
Poverty specifically makes
monetary concerns top of mind,

00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:13.690
so the poor might be acting
more rational in some ways,

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:15.880
in some sense, in
financial choices, which

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.100
is kind of what the evidence
that I just showed you

00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:21.230
in there, several studies
that try to make that point.

00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:25.030
But you know, scarcity might
then deteriorate performance

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.480
at other cognitive tasks.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:30.285
Now, here's sort of a
PowerPoint version of that,

00:22:30.285 --> 00:22:31.660
which, you know,
people may think

00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:32.743
about many things in life.

00:22:32.743 --> 00:22:34.270
They might think about rent.

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:36.610
They might think about
the kids doing well,

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:41.977
eating healthy, utilities,
car payments, and so on.

00:22:41.977 --> 00:22:43.060
But what does scarcity do?

00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.830
It magnifies,
essentially, people's

00:22:44.830 --> 00:22:47.410
thoughts about rent, car
payments and utility bills.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:50.350
These are all monetary things
that people think about a lot,

00:22:50.350 --> 00:22:53.380
and thn it might sort of
like drown out or like force

00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:56.380
out other thoughts about other
things, about eating healthy

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:59.890
or about taking care of
the kids in other ways

00:22:59.890 --> 00:23:02.680
than paying the bills, OK.

00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.690
And so now, I'm
going to show you

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:07.260
evidence of two studies that
sort of support this point.

00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.668
The first one, the
paper is called

00:23:09.668 --> 00:23:11.210
"Poverty impedes
cognitive function."

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.860
That was the reading for today.

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:14.907
The first one is
called the mall study.

00:23:14.907 --> 00:23:16.240
So what does this mall study do?

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.850
It's kind of like
a lab experiment,

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:21.700
but it's sort of in some
sense like a field experiment.

00:23:21.700 --> 00:23:27.850
So it's a major Jersey mall that
asks shoppers or stops shoppers

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:31.240
with a median household
income of roughly $70,000,

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.110
so sort of richer than
the average American,

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:39.010
but with quite a bit of
range of income overall.

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.520
So there's like very rich
people and fairly poor people.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.910
And then there's a sequence
of three events, essentially,

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.820
which is, people are asked
hypothetical questions

00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.230
involving money.

00:23:50.230 --> 00:23:52.330
Some are hard and some are easy.

00:23:52.330 --> 00:23:54.670
And then people are asked
to do cognitive tests,

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:57.940
a non-verbal test that
sort of measures people's

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.340
fluid intelligence, which
is Raven's Matrices, which

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:01.765
you might be familiar with.

00:24:01.765 --> 00:24:03.730
They're sort of IQ type tests.

00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.440
And some form of
cognitive control,

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.940
which essentially
is about like, are

00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:14.350
you able to overwrite
automatic responses when

00:24:14.350 --> 00:24:15.970
doing cognitive tasks.

00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:19.180
And then number three, then,
is like people that answer

00:24:19.180 --> 00:24:20.540
the hypothetical questions.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:21.850
So what does this look like?

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:23.950
A hypothetical
question is involving

00:24:23.950 --> 00:24:25.960
money, which is the following.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.810
Your car is having some
trouble and requires x dollars

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:29.770
to be fixed.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.710
You can pay in full, take
a loan or take a chance

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.880
and forgo the service
at the moment.

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.525
How would you go about
making this decision?

00:24:37.525 --> 00:24:39.650
And so then, people ask
this question and they say,

00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:41.442
well, you can think
about this for a while.

00:24:41.442 --> 00:24:43.420
And afterwards, I'm
going to ask you

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.430
about the answer
to that question.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:49.570
And then there's a hard
version and an easy version.

00:24:49.570 --> 00:24:53.470
The idea is that the experiment
wants to keep everything

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.680
the same for like
across treatments,

00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.460
and the idea is that $150
for the average American

00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.050
is not that much
money, so it's not

00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:04.030
going to be a huge
problem for most people,

00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:06.250
at least in normal
times of their lives.

00:25:06.250 --> 00:25:09.670
But $1,500 is actually a lot
of money for like a low income

00:25:09.670 --> 00:25:11.770
person in the US,
but perhaps not

00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.530
that big of a deal
for a rich person.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:17.152
Like for a rich person, the
$1,500 or $150 are both fine.

00:25:17.152 --> 00:25:19.360
They're going to have some
money in the bank account,

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.110
and they're going to
deal with it somehow.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:22.150
It's not a huge issue.

00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:27.580
For the poor person, $150 is not
great, but not a huge problem

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.750
or not a huge headache.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:31.120
But $1,500 surely is really bad.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.510
That's sort of the
idea here, right.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:38.435
Now what the study that
finds is that-- and let

00:25:38.435 --> 00:25:39.810
me walk you through
these graphs.

00:25:39.810 --> 00:25:41.580
Let's look on the left side.

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:43.650
On the right side
is quite similar.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.950
You'll see here
always four bars.

00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:52.440
The dark bars are how people
are doing after the hard task,

00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:56.760
and the lighter bars
after the easy task.

00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.940
Let's start with
the light gray bars,

00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:01.703
comparing the poor
versus the rich.

00:26:01.703 --> 00:26:03.370
And what you essentially
see is the poor

00:26:03.370 --> 00:26:05.730
and the rich are doing
pretty much the same

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.563
after doing the easy task.

00:26:08.563 --> 00:26:10.230
But to be clear,
what's poor versus rich

00:26:10.230 --> 00:26:13.150
is essentially being split
by the median income.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.773
So if you're above the
median, you're called rich.

00:26:15.773 --> 00:26:17.190
If you're below
the median, you're

00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:19.830
called poor for the
purpose of this study.

00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:24.460
Now, for the easy
task here, this

00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.220
is like the rich do
essentially as well or as badly

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.330
as the poor do.

00:26:28.330 --> 00:26:35.200
They get about 40% correct
in these Raven's puzzles,

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.070
and the poor do
essentially the same.

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:39.640
So there's no difference
after the easy task.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.530
Now, after the hard
task, for the rich,

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:42.040
essentially it's the same.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.750
If anything, they do
a little bit better.

00:26:43.750 --> 00:26:46.930
The difference is not
statistically significant.

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:51.160
In contrast, you see like
a clear drop in performance

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:52.500
among the poor, OK.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:56.050
They do about like 12
percentage points worse.

00:26:56.050 --> 00:27:00.830
This is really like a huge
difference in how well people--

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.320
so this is for Raven's Matrices.

00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.420
This is for what's
called hearts and flowers

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.460
for cognitive control,
which is essentially

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.590
how good are people at
controlling their attention

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:11.377
or resources.

00:27:11.377 --> 00:27:13.210
And what you see is
essentially more or less

00:27:13.210 --> 00:27:15.860
the same pattern, that
for the easy task,

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:18.740
the rich and the poor
do pretty much the same.

00:27:18.740 --> 00:27:20.530
The hard task compared
to the easy task

00:27:20.530 --> 00:27:21.760
does nothing for the rich.

00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:23.440
This is actually,
the performance

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:25.210
is the same or
slightly different

00:27:25.210 --> 00:27:27.610
but not statistically
significantly so.

00:27:27.610 --> 00:27:30.490
For the poor, there is a
large drop in performance

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:32.450
compared to the rich.

00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:33.590
Any questions on that?

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:45.790
OK, So then I'm going to show
you the second study that's

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:46.742
related to this.

00:27:46.742 --> 00:27:48.200
So one thing you
might sort of say,

00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:51.780
well, we're going to show
you, already, a study, so why

00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.890
do we need another study
when we already did one.

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:56.710
We showed you that like poverty
and thinking about poverty

00:27:56.710 --> 00:28:02.770
affects people's cognition, so
why do we need more evidence. .

00:28:02.770 --> 00:28:05.600
So effort is an
interesting issue that--

00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.080
so there's, in fact,
this study has--

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:10.960
and I took this out of the
slides because I had too many.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:13.180
There's an incentivized
version of this task.

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.130
And the authors
do find that, even

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:18.670
once you incentivize
these tasks,

00:28:18.670 --> 00:28:20.320
we find the same patterns.

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:24.050
But even there, it's a bit
sort of like a task that

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:26.360
is not a task that people
do in their real life.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.720
And in a way, which is actually
not what the harvest study is

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:33.950
addressing, you might wonder.

00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:37.040
Does this translate into real
world choices and decisions

00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:40.340
that actually have consequence
for people's behaviors?

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.680
To be clear, these effects
here, these differences

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.487
in cognitive performances,
are very large.

00:28:44.487 --> 00:28:46.820
This is like the order of
magnitude something like 10 IQ

00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.220
points, which is really huge.

00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:52.340
So you might sort of argue that
we think that IQ, et cetera,

00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.400
matters a lot.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.240
So in some sense, that's
what Mullainathan and Shafir

00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:57.897
would argue.

00:28:57.897 --> 00:28:58.980
But, no, I agree with you.

00:28:58.980 --> 00:29:00.855
In some sense, we would
like to see does this

00:29:00.855 --> 00:29:03.330
translate into
real world choices

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:10.850
that we see in people's
everyday lives.

00:29:10.850 --> 00:29:13.630
Now, I think we talked
about a few of those things.

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.590
So one is external
validity concerns,

00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:19.400
which is to say, look, we did
this study in the mall, which

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.380
is a little bit of
a funny thing to do.

00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:23.980
And you hear about the
scenario, which is kind of weird

00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.130
and maybe tricks you out.

00:29:25.130 --> 00:29:26.755
And maybe the poor
are more freaked out

00:29:26.755 --> 00:29:28.760
than the rich for some reason.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.060
But really, if you
think about paying back

00:29:32.060 --> 00:29:36.410
your debt or any sort of school
fees or just not having money,

00:29:36.410 --> 00:29:38.510
that's a repeated
exposure of something

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:39.873
that know in your real life.

00:29:39.873 --> 00:29:41.790
For example, not having
harvest versus harvest

00:29:41.790 --> 00:29:46.650
is a thing that you experience
every year or every twice

00:29:46.650 --> 00:29:47.398
a year even.

00:29:47.398 --> 00:29:48.940
And so you think
some of these things

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.520
might sort of go away
with repeat exposure.

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:54.360
And so we kind of would like to
have a real world setting where

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.540
we have actually real
world natural variation

00:29:57.540 --> 00:30:00.270
or sort of experimental
variation potentially as

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:04.320
opposed to the somewhat weird
feature in some mall somebody

00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.740
talks you up and asks you some
questions, which people might

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.590
find funny and might not be
representative for what people

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:12.330
do with their lives.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.080
And then the second
part is kind of how do

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:15.930
we interpret magnitudes, right?

00:30:15.930 --> 00:30:21.100
So I showed up and said, look,
these effects are really large.

00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:23.860
After the hard task, the
poor do worse than the rich.

00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.570
But we have no
idea how we should

00:30:25.570 --> 00:30:28.960
scale this in terms of
what does it actually mean

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.020
for actual effects of poverty.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:35.090
Suppose I give somebody
$1,000 or $10,000,

00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:37.220
what does it do to
people's performance?

00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:38.890
It essentially,
what this shows, is

00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:40.840
that the poor are
more sort of frazzled

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.155
by these financial questions.

00:30:42.155 --> 00:30:43.780
But it gives you
essentially-- and that

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.697
seems to be important
because the magnitude is

00:30:45.697 --> 00:30:46.977
large and these effects.

00:30:46.977 --> 00:30:49.060
But there's no way to
actually scale these effects

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:51.970
in some sense in thinking
about what is this priming

00:30:51.970 --> 00:30:54.700
intervention actually correspond
to in the real world in terms

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:57.203
of dollars and how rich
or poor people are.

00:30:57.203 --> 00:30:58.870
So that's another
sort of reason why you

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.320
might want to do another study.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:02.920
OK.

00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.570
So what is the other study?

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:06.240
As Lauren was
already saying, it's

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:09.490
a study with 464
sugarcane farmers

00:31:09.490 --> 00:31:12.460
in 54 villages in Tamil Nadu.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.080
These are small
scale farmers that

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.000
earn at least the majority of
60% of income from sugarcane.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.940
So these are mostly
sugarcane farmers.

00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.360
And crucially for the
study, the harvest

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:27.220
is staggered over
a three to five

00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:30.280
month period set by the
sugar mills due to capacity

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.250
constraints.

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:34.742
So it's not some people
harvest earlier than others

00:31:34.742 --> 00:31:36.700
because they decide to
do so maybe because they

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:38.020
need more cash.

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:40.240
But it's rather because
of capacity constraints.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:45.850
The sugar mill is essentially
deciding who to harvests early

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:47.440
and who harvests late.

00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:49.210
And so, now, what
this study explored

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:54.190
is that the sugarcane harvest
cycle takes about 18 months.

00:31:54.190 --> 00:31:55.870
It's extremely long.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:32:03.220
And as a result, farmers tend to
be relatively poor pre-harvest.

00:32:03.220 --> 00:32:07.840
Think of that this is like grad
school and undergrad stipends.

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.460
If you have that
money for the month

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.580
or the semester or the like,
the beginning of the semester

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.040
is always amazing--

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.093
or month, for that
matter, is always amazing.

00:32:16.093 --> 00:32:17.010
You have lots of cash.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:19.270
And you can do lots
of nice things.

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:22.990
And then towards the end
of the month or semester,

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:26.290
people tend to run
out of cash, at least

00:32:26.290 --> 00:32:30.920
when I was a grad student
or student in general.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.740
Similar things are
true for food stamps

00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.158
or other sort of cash programs.

00:32:35.158 --> 00:32:36.950
There's quite a bit of
evidence that shows,

00:32:36.950 --> 00:32:38.492
at the beginning of
the month, people

00:32:38.492 --> 00:32:41.060
are doing a lot better
than at the end, which

00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:44.450
seems to suggest that people
have trouble smoothing

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:47.960
their income over
time, which presumably

00:32:47.960 --> 00:32:51.380
has to do with some form of
self-control or other problems.

00:32:51.380 --> 00:32:53.210
But so for the
purpose of this study,

00:32:53.210 --> 00:32:55.910
farmers are relatively
poor pre-harvest.

00:32:55.910 --> 00:32:58.160
And that now allows
the authors to look

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.740
at within person
comparisons of people,

00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:03.800
sometimes when they're poor and
sometimes when they're rich,

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.470
at looking at the
cognitive performance,

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:09.920
by looking at people
pre and post harvest.

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:12.775
Now, first, you want to
kind of see some evidence

00:33:12.775 --> 00:33:14.650
that farmers' financial
situation is actually

00:33:14.650 --> 00:33:16.180
worse pre-harvest.

00:33:16.180 --> 00:33:18.280
And so there's quite a few--

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:21.220
and you can focus on
the first column here--

00:33:21.220 --> 00:33:22.600
pieces of evidence.

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:25.920
People are more likely to
have their belongings pawned.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.350
They're more likely to
have loans outstanding.

00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:32.020
They also have more
loans outstanding.

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:37.120
They're also more likely to say
yes to the question or higher

00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:40.750
scores to the question
about their ability

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:49.120
to cope with ordinary bills in
the past 15 days post-harvest.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.580
And so all of these things sort
of are saying, essentially,

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.642
before harvest, farmers are in
a financially tricky situation.

00:33:55.642 --> 00:33:57.850
And after harvest, that gets
better because they get,

00:33:57.850 --> 00:33:59.950
essentially, a bunch of
cash from this harvest.

00:33:59.950 --> 00:34:01.600
Because, essentially,
it's a cash crop.

00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.017
You sell your sugarcane, and
then you get a bunch of money

00:34:04.017 --> 00:34:07.170
that you can use over
the next 18 months.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:11.190
Now, then the authors find,
again, using Raven's matrices

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:13.050
and some measures of
cognitive control,

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:16.409
that people are doing a lot
worse pre-harvest compared

00:34:16.409 --> 00:34:17.550
to post-harvest.

00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:20.580
In terms of Raven's
matrices, this is accurate.

00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:22.560
Essentially, people
do better than getting

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:28.050
more Raven's matrices correct
compared to the control group.

00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:31.380
They also are doing better in
terms of cognitive control.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.460
Post-harvest response
times go down,

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:34.770
which is a good thing here.

00:34:34.770 --> 00:34:38.350
And post-harvest,
also, people's errors

00:34:38.350 --> 00:34:39.550
go down in these measures.

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.480
And there's a lot of
detail related to that.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:45.600
But in some sense, that doesn't
matter much for you right now.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.120
People, essentially, are
doing better post-harvest

00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.150
when they have more cash.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.770
Now, what confounds
can you think about?

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:57.060
What are potential
problems with this result?

00:35:01.060 --> 00:35:04.250
Actually, this is
consistent with poverty

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:05.838
impeding cognitive
function, but there

00:35:05.838 --> 00:35:07.130
could be other things going on.

00:35:07.130 --> 00:35:09.710
And what are these other things?

00:35:09.710 --> 00:35:12.140
I think there's
some good evidence--

00:35:12.140 --> 00:35:15.380
or one good thing
is that it would

00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:18.410
have to be a very specific shock
that has to do with harvest.

00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:21.080
Because, essentially,
the harvest period

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:23.250
was staggered over
several months.

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:25.850
So it's not like, at
some point, the weather

00:35:25.850 --> 00:35:27.410
got worse or the
weather got better.

00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:29.810
Because some people actually
harvest earlier than others,

00:35:29.810 --> 00:35:31.260
and there's a
pre-post comparison.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.860
But there could be other stuff,
time trends or something,

00:35:33.860 --> 00:35:36.630
going on at least in some ways.

00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:39.892
In a way, I think a
confound or, in a way,

00:35:39.892 --> 00:35:41.600
it's also just a
different interpretation

00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.090
perhaps in some ways
in the sense of saying,

00:35:44.090 --> 00:35:47.550
well, it's not just worries
about the level of income.

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.090
But it's also worries about,
essentially, risk or anxiety,

00:35:51.090 --> 00:35:51.590
essentially.

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:52.965
And so that's
slightly different,

00:35:52.965 --> 00:35:55.190
but the anxiety could
also sort of capture

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:58.440
people's minds in some ways.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.440
Of course, then you would
want to see something,

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.390
like maybe that's
worse for the rich

00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:04.620
compared to the poor
or things like that.

00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:05.840
But that's exactly right.

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:08.690
So there could be
essentially labor costs

00:36:08.690 --> 00:36:10.700
or any sort of other
distractions related

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.628
to the harvest, which--

00:36:14.628 --> 00:36:16.920
this is kind of related to
what [INAUDIBLE] was saying,

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.740
which is the
harvest itself might

00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:22.438
have these kinds of effects.

00:36:22.438 --> 00:36:24.230
OK, I think we mentioned
most of the things

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:27.440
that I have on my list.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.750
So there's first one is
calorie consumption, which

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.630
is sort of the typical thing
that development economists can

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:36.860
study a lot, which is
to say, poor nutrition

00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:39.200
might make people do worse.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.390
It's bad for attention.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.860
We talked a little bit about
shopping on a hungry stomach,

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:49.020
but also think about doing tests
or exams on an empty stomach

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:50.760
is probably not a good idea.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:54.740
The author's have some evidence
that the food expenditures are

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:59.240
pretty similar pre and post high
harvest from some other sample.

00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:01.430
Overall, malnutrition
doesn't seem

00:37:01.430 --> 00:37:05.240
to be a huge issue in this area.

00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.950
Having said that,
I think it's also

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:10.255
reasonable to think that pre and
post harvest you should have,

00:37:10.255 --> 00:37:11.130
actually, more money.

00:37:11.130 --> 00:37:13.297
And then you've got to spend
the money on something.

00:37:13.297 --> 00:37:15.260
And presumably, some of
that would go on food.

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:19.070
So the authors argue that
nutrition is not a big issue.

00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.500
Then there's sort of
two broad issues, which

00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:25.580
I think was Joseph and
Katherine's comments, which

00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:27.800
is about the uncertainty
of the harvest size

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.920
and some issues related
to labor effort.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.490
And so, here, the authors
have some evidence

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:37.537
from post-harvest
pre-payment sample.

00:37:37.537 --> 00:37:38.370
What does that mean?

00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:40.670
This is a sample
that these are people

00:37:40.670 --> 00:37:48.350
who have harvested already,
so they have already

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:49.680
exerted the labor effort.

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:55.190
And they also know already
their approximate payment.

00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:59.000
And-- sorry.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.740
I was getting confused by this.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:04.370
So these are people who have
already done their harvest.

00:38:04.370 --> 00:38:06.110
They have done all
the work already.

00:38:06.110 --> 00:38:09.050
They know already what the
harvest size will be like.

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:12.260
But those people,
essentially, are still

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.190
not doing better compared
to the people who

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.710
have received their cash.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.530
So that essentially
is to say, even

00:38:18.530 --> 00:38:22.170
once you have done all
the effort and so on,

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:27.020
that doesn't seem to help in
a sense of you're fully doing,

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.890
you're not exhausted
from the work already.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:30.557
You already have all
your harvest there.

00:38:30.557 --> 00:38:32.280
You already know how
big your harvest is,

00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:35.723
but you haven't really
received the money yet.

00:38:35.723 --> 00:38:37.640
And you know already
what the harvest size is.

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.067
It can't really be about
anxiety of the harvest size.

00:38:40.067 --> 00:38:42.150
Yet if you compare those
people to the people that

00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:45.000
received the money,
you saw few differences

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.960
between those people
and the people

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:51.150
who have done
already the harvest.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:56.220
And so that argues
that essentially it's

00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.390
not about anxiety, per se,
about the harvest size,

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:02.730
but rather about
just having money

00:39:02.730 --> 00:39:05.640
in your pocket versus not.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:08.130
Let me see what the--

00:39:08.130 --> 00:39:09.994
is this the correct graph?

00:39:15.778 --> 00:39:16.750
I see.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:18.940
So this is a little bit
misleadingly labeled.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:21.040
What this is supposed
to say is this

00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:23.020
is post-harvest and pre-harvest.

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.390
But what they mean by
post-harvest and pre-harvest,

00:39:25.390 --> 00:39:27.640
post-harvest is
meant by you have

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:29.630
received the cash versus not.

00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:32.440
But both of these are actually
both post-harvest in the sense

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:36.850
that they have done
already the work.

00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:38.440
Anyway, sorry, that's
a bit confusing.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:41.403
But essentially, what
they're trying to say

00:39:41.403 --> 00:39:42.820
is essentially
what really matters

00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:46.930
is not the work around
the harvest, per se,

00:39:46.930 --> 00:39:48.610
or the uncertainty
around the harvest.

00:39:48.610 --> 00:39:52.540
It's really about receiving
the cash versus not.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.180
And then there's
another problem,

00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:58.060
which you haven't
really brought up

00:39:58.060 --> 00:40:00.950
which is the issue of
learning effects, right?

00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:03.990
When people do the
task several times,

00:40:03.990 --> 00:40:05.490
presumably when you
do a test twice,

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:08.350
you're going to do better.

00:40:08.350 --> 00:40:11.470
But to address this issue,
they also have what's

00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:13.000
called a hold-out
sample that takes

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.040
the cognitive tests for the
first time post-harvest.

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:19.450
So what I showed you before
was proposed for both people

00:40:19.450 --> 00:40:20.800
that have both of these tests.

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:23.080
There are some samples
that's only done

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:25.360
the task once post-harvest.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:27.370
And they don't perform
worse than people

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:30.460
who do the task for the second
time, which seems to say

00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.218
it's not really about learning.

00:40:32.218 --> 00:40:33.760
Having said that,
that is essentially

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.220
only a small subsample.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.980
Comparison really seems
mostly underpowered.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:42.176
And there are some concerns,
surely, about still effects.

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:46.130
Any questions on these?

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:00.130
OK.

00:41:06.180 --> 00:41:08.100
So this is a study
from a few years ago.

00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:13.170
So then what kind of follow
up is there that sort

00:41:13.170 --> 00:41:14.670
of considers further evidence?

00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:17.405
So there's one very nice
study by Carvalho et al.

00:41:17.405 --> 00:41:21.390
in 2015 that looks at
the same issue in the US.

00:41:21.390 --> 00:41:24.750
And they looked at cognition
and decision making of US

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:27.870
households around paydays.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:30.540
And essentially, they find no
cognitive effects whatsoever.

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.940
They also find no
effects of decision

00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:36.070
making as one would
have expected.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.870
It raises the question
about what's going on here.

00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:41.380
And [INAUDIBLE] what's going on.

00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.380
So it could be that this
is an external validity

00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.280
issue in some sense.

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.860
In a sense, really
what is needed here

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:48.840
is really extreme
poverty and really

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.500
large differences in people's
income or the amount of money

00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:53.810
that they have available.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.670
And when you look at
US households, at least

00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:59.130
the households that were
considered in the Carvalho

00:41:59.130 --> 00:42:00.690
study about payday,
well, there's

00:42:00.690 --> 00:42:02.520
differences in how
much money they have,

00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.570
cash on hand they have.

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:06.080
The difference is
actually not that huge.

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:09.300
And so that might just be
not sufficiently [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:11.400
around those paydays
to be able to generate

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:13.560
those type of effects.

00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:17.830
It could also be that
these effects don't really

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:22.910
replicate in a sense of it's
a replicability issue, which

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:24.888
could be a concern as well.

00:42:24.888 --> 00:42:26.930
There's a nice study--
and this gets to the issue

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:30.020
that I think Joseph
mentioned, which

00:42:30.020 --> 00:42:35.570
is a study by Lichand and Mani
looking at drought insurance.

00:42:35.570 --> 00:42:39.440
And what they essentially
argue is that,

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:41.660
when you [? provide ?]
[? people with ?] insurance--

00:42:41.660 --> 00:42:45.200
so usually insurance, or
people would argue, is useful.

00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:47.582
If a bad state
happens in the world,

00:42:47.582 --> 00:42:49.790
you can essentially get--
might get a payment, right?

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:52.880
If I get some health shock or if
my harvest is bad or the like,

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.940
I get some money from
the insurance company.

00:42:54.940 --> 00:42:56.210
And that is good.

00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.730
Because in the bad state,
the marginal utility

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:00.740
is really high of
receiving money.

00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:04.280
And so if I am willing to
pay for insurance right now,

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:08.660
in the future receiving-- so
I'm willing to pay for insurance

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:09.160
now.

00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:12.070
Because in the future, in
a bad state of the world,

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:15.400
I value that money more than
in a good state of the world.

00:43:15.400 --> 00:43:19.260
So in a good state [INAUDIBLE]
willing to pay for insurance.

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.810
Now, what Lichand and Mani
are instead arguing is,

00:43:21.810 --> 00:43:23.400
well, there's an
additional value

00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.900
of insurance, which
essentially it's

00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:29.160
helping reduce their anxiety
and worries about money ex ante

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.330
in all states of the world.

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:33.670
That is to say, if I'm really
worried about bad harvest

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.910
shocks or other stuff,
health stocks happening

00:43:35.910 --> 00:43:38.503
in the future, that might
really frazzle me and really

00:43:38.503 --> 00:43:40.920
sort of worry you all the time,
which in turn might affect

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.960
people's cognitive performance.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.790
Well, that's in all
states of the world.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.860
Even when you're
doing well right now,

00:43:46.860 --> 00:43:48.480
even if nothing
bad ever happens,

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:50.925
you're going to do worse
today because you're

00:43:50.925 --> 00:43:52.050
worried about these things.

00:43:52.050 --> 00:43:54.450
And sort of providing
insurance, therefore,

00:43:54.450 --> 00:43:57.240
might help people better even
in good states of the world

00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:59.070
or in all states of
the world in addition

00:43:59.070 --> 00:44:01.800
to sort of having the insurance
value of helping people

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.200
in that state of the world.

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:06.228
Well, they have
some evidence of it.

00:44:06.228 --> 00:44:07.770
There is some mixed
evidence overall.

00:44:07.770 --> 00:44:09.900
But I think the
idea of insurance

00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.290
being helpful for the
poor, for anybody, not just

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:14.910
because it helps in
bad states, but it

00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:16.830
helps people worry
about bad states,

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:18.390
is a very nice
one that hopefully

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.080
will be explored further.

00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:25.038
Now, then another question that
I think Jose was bringing up

00:44:25.038 --> 00:44:27.080
is to say, well, there
are these cognitive tasks.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.580
Well, I showed you
so far that there

00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:31.280
are these tasks and Raven's
matrices and cognitive control.

00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:34.490
And sort of, arguably, IQ tests
are important then and helpful.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:37.850
And we think that's helpful
and maps to something

00:44:37.850 --> 00:44:39.182
useful for the world.

00:44:39.182 --> 00:44:40.640
But it's a little
bit hard to tell.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.050
Does this actually
matter for income?

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:43.820
Is this really important
or not important?

00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.650
And how much does it--

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:52.970
so in a paper with
[INAUDIBLE] we

00:44:52.970 --> 00:44:54.500
looked at this in
a field setting

00:44:54.500 --> 00:45:00.230
where the workers in Orissa
and rural areas in India.

00:45:00.230 --> 00:45:03.140
And what we did there
is we hired people

00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.910
for about two weeks to do a
simple labor cast where they

00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:13.010
were doing leaf plates, so
essentially putting together

00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:18.320
leafs into plates, which are
sort of used in many settings,

00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.160
by stitching them together
using little wooden sticks.

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:24.770
And so people are
hired for two weeks.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:28.280
And then for the
sample, we varied.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:31.580
Some people were paid
earlier, and some people

00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.760
were paid later.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.940
So everybody was paid
exactly the same,

00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:38.120
conditional on showing up and
conditional on how much they

00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.630
produced.

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:41.172
So their piece rates, how much
they were paid, were the same.

00:45:41.172 --> 00:45:43.552
And their attendance
paid for showing up.

00:45:43.552 --> 00:45:46.010
The only difference was that
some people were paid earlier,

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:49.290
and some people were paid later.

00:45:49.290 --> 00:45:54.090
So that allows us then look at
how do people, the same people,

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:56.510
how would they perform
when they're paid already

00:45:56.510 --> 00:46:00.380
versus not, compared to another
group that is essentially

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:02.340
only paid later.

00:46:02.340 --> 00:46:04.160
And this is a period
in the lean period

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.710
when people are extremely
financially constrained.

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:08.450
So people are really
short on cash.

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:10.640
And you can look,
essentially, really

00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:14.650
at the impact of
transfers or cash

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:16.890
constraints in this setting.

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:19.100
What we find is a
relatively clear evidence

00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:23.510
that paying people early makes
people a lot more productive.

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.400
And moreover, these
effects are the largest

00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:26.600
for the poorest workers.

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.060
So essentially, when you sort
of divide the sample in two,

00:46:29.060 --> 00:46:31.940
along the people who are richer
and poorer to start with,

00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.240
people who are particularly
poor have the largest impacts

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.148
in the sample.

00:46:36.148 --> 00:46:37.940
And this have sort of
pretty large effects.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.800
It's about 5% to 10%
of the productivity,

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.030
which is doesn't sound that
large in absolute terms.

00:46:44.030 --> 00:46:46.070
But in relative
terms or in terms

00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:48.200
of when you double
people's wages,

00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:53.940
people's earnings go up only
as much or not much more.

00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:55.820
So really increasing
people's productivity

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.800
is very, very hard
in these settings.

00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.110
And relatively
minor interventions,

00:47:00.110 --> 00:47:03.740
such as the one that we did,
had pretty large effects

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:07.250
in the real world setting for
people for whom this is really

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:11.340
their real jobs in their real
life for about two weeks.

00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.190
So suppose you hired
somebody for a year.

00:47:14.190 --> 00:47:19.530
Should you pay them daily,
weekly, monthly, or what?

00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.220
And so what I'm arguing or
what our evidence shows,

00:47:22.220 --> 00:47:25.370
that when you hire people for
two weeks, paying people twice,

00:47:25.370 --> 00:47:28.460
as in paying people once
after a week and then the rest

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.010
at the end, makes
workers more productive

00:47:31.010 --> 00:47:34.308
than paying workers
only at the very end.

00:47:34.308 --> 00:47:36.350
And assuming, you know,
depending on the interest

00:47:36.350 --> 00:47:40.680
rate-- but that seems to be a
thing the company should do.

00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:43.440
But of course, if you
hire people for a year,

00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:48.295
then paying people weekly
versus monthly or biweekly,

00:47:48.295 --> 00:47:49.920
the comparison becomes
quite different.

00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:51.837
Because essentially, the
control group, that's

00:47:51.837 --> 00:47:53.028
paid after two weeks.

00:47:53.028 --> 00:47:54.570
Now, after two weeks,
of course, they

00:47:54.570 --> 00:47:57.690
have a lot more money
because they haven't spent it

00:47:57.690 --> 00:48:00.810
compared to the treatment
group who's paid earlier.

00:48:00.810 --> 00:48:06.160
And I think there, essentially,
we can't really speak to that.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:11.110
In some sense, our design is
not really set up to do this.

00:48:11.110 --> 00:48:15.570
You would have to do at
least another week or two

00:48:15.570 --> 00:48:17.760
to measure how is the
control group now doing

00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.610
compared to the treatment
group or do it repeatedly.

00:48:20.610 --> 00:48:23.915
And there might also be
some effects on over time,

00:48:23.915 --> 00:48:25.290
repeatedly, some
of these effects

00:48:25.290 --> 00:48:27.320
might be going away
because workers learn

00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.400
and so on and so forth.

00:48:29.400 --> 00:48:33.060
I think of this evidence much
more as a proof of concept

00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:38.520
that, A, providing cash or
alleviating cash constraints

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:41.580
among workers, either through
some low interest rate

00:48:41.580 --> 00:48:45.660
loans or some early payments
or some form of UBI or cash

00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:48.510
transfers, unconditional or
conditional cash transfers,

00:48:48.510 --> 00:48:50.910
essentially improving
workers financial situation

00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:54.410
in some ways, can be
productive for firms.

00:48:54.410 --> 00:48:56.430
Now, how the firm then
actually does that

00:48:56.430 --> 00:48:57.690
we don't necessarily know.

00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.340
And this is sort of
too small, short,

00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:01.308
of an experiment to show that.

00:49:01.308 --> 00:49:03.600
But it's sort of proof of
concept that, in a real world

00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.830
setting with very high
stakes for workers--

00:49:05.830 --> 00:49:09.790
this is their real earnings--
there seem to be these effects.

00:49:09.790 --> 00:49:11.377
So for firms, it
might be, well, do

00:49:11.377 --> 00:49:13.500
they have to, in
fact, try to improve

00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:16.770
their financial
situation [INAUDIBLE]..

00:49:16.770 --> 00:49:19.890
Or for governments, it
might be valuable to think

00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:23.157
about cash transfers as
a way to do-- so usually,

00:49:23.157 --> 00:49:24.990
when you think about
cash transfers-- so let

00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:27.010
me actually just talk
about this for a second.

00:49:27.010 --> 00:49:30.540
And then we can talk about
other confounds of the study.

00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.450
So usually, when you think about
the public debate about cash

00:49:33.450 --> 00:49:36.840
transfers and about sort of
welfare programs for the poor,

00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.065
often sort of the
right-wing response is,

00:49:39.065 --> 00:49:40.690
well, aren't the poor
going to be lazy?

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:41.940
And they're not going to work.

00:49:41.940 --> 00:49:44.698
And then what about effort
and so on and so forth?

00:49:44.698 --> 00:49:45.990
And they get used to the money.

00:49:45.990 --> 00:49:48.990
And then don't work
hard enough eventually.

00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:51.510
Well, the evidence that
we have here in our paper

00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:53.790
seems to say, in
fact, the opposite.

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:56.922
That is to say workers,
when you alleviate

00:49:56.922 --> 00:49:59.130
their financial constraints,
when you give them cash,

00:49:59.130 --> 00:50:00.570
they become more productive.

00:50:00.570 --> 00:50:03.850
And they work harder
than otherwise.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.150
Granted, we don't have
any labor supply response.

00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:08.650
What I'm showing you here is
essentially productivity, which

00:50:08.650 --> 00:50:11.760
is how hard a worker's working
or how much work a worker is

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.450
producing per hour worked.

00:50:15.450 --> 00:50:19.088
But I think similar things could
be true for cash transfers.

00:50:19.088 --> 00:50:20.880
And there's some quite
interesting evidence

00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:23.460
on cash transfer programs.

00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:27.390
So both cash transfer
and, in particular,

00:50:27.390 --> 00:50:29.070
what's called ultra-poor
programs, which

00:50:29.070 --> 00:50:34.380
are sort of these
multi-faceted asset programs,

00:50:34.380 --> 00:50:38.250
leads to large and sustained
increases in asset, savings,

00:50:38.250 --> 00:50:39.690
consumptions, et cetera.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:44.190
That is to say, once you provide
people with financial resources

00:50:44.190 --> 00:50:46.690
when they're very poor,
not only do they better

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:47.760
in the short run.

00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.800
But in the case of the
ultra-poor programs,

00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.030
in the long run three
to five years later,

00:50:52.030 --> 00:50:55.530
people are doing better in
terms of having more assets,

00:50:55.530 --> 00:50:58.876
saving more, consuming
more, and so on.

00:50:58.876 --> 00:51:04.300
And that seems to say that
there might be an issue going on

00:51:04.300 --> 00:51:06.640
and some form of a
poverty trap going on.

00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:08.890
And somewhere of the
underlying potential channels

00:51:08.890 --> 00:51:11.510
might be things like scarcity,
stress, mental health, and so

00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:12.010
on.

00:51:12.010 --> 00:51:14.635
We're going to talk a little bit
about mental health and stress

00:51:14.635 --> 00:51:15.500
in a second.

00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.430
But essentially, if there are
these types of effects going on

00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:22.810
for the government or any
other sort of public policy,

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:28.090
these kinds of programs,
conditional cash transfers,

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:31.240
in addition to having the
advantage of improving people's

00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:37.170
well-being and having the high
marginal utility of money when

00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.440
they're very poor, it
might also, in addition,

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.050
make people more
productive as opposed

00:51:42.050 --> 00:51:45.378
to a working less or the like.

00:51:45.378 --> 00:51:46.920
So I think those
two things, I think,

00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:51.270
are sort of the takeaways.

00:51:51.270 --> 00:51:53.730
If one wanted to understand
optimal pay structures,

00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:56.940
one would have to do longer
run types of experiments,

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:00.280
as Natalie pointed out.

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:04.080
So essentially, the way
we set this up is we

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:05.730
essentially pay people--

00:52:05.730 --> 00:52:06.230
sorry.

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:09.060
This is my Slack making noise--

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:14.990
pay people to--
sorry, [INAUDIBLE]----

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:16.250
people through the employer.

00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:18.500
Essentially, we said, OK,
the employer is paying, now,

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.390
earlier versus later.

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:25.100
And naturally, then the worker
might just [INAUDIBLE] happier

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:28.350
or doing better financially, but
also like the employer better

00:52:28.350 --> 00:52:30.097
and saying, look, you
just paid me early.

00:52:30.097 --> 00:52:31.680
I now trust you more
that you're going

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:32.940
to be paying me in the future.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:34.470
Maybe that's some
form of gift giving

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:37.053
or reciprocity, again, sort of
happy about things, [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:37.053 --> 00:52:40.240
work harder to make
the employer happy.

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.340
There are several
things to get at this.

00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.490
And the most important
part, perhaps, you also

00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:50.500
have that we announced
essentially the structure

00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.990
a few days before the
actual payment is made.

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:56.080
That is to say, on day five, we
announce and say, on the 8th,

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.460
you're going to be paid
versus we don't announce it.

00:52:58.460 --> 00:52:59.980
We say you're going
to be paid only

00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:02.330
later at the end of the study.

00:53:02.330 --> 00:53:08.100
And so if you think this is
about reciprocity or feelings

00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.550
towards the employer, you
would think that then workers

00:53:11.550 --> 00:53:13.440
should then already
be working harder

00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:16.560
once they hear about when they
get these kind of announcement

00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:17.413
effects.

00:53:17.413 --> 00:53:19.080
And it seems to be
the case that there's

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.456
essentially no announcement
effect whatsoever.

00:53:21.456 --> 00:53:26.190
Workers only become productive
pretty much precisely

00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.110
once they receive
their cash on hand,

00:53:29.110 --> 00:53:31.050
which is very much
consistent with what

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.010
I showed you earlier, the
results from Mani et al.,

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:35.940
in their study.

00:53:35.940 --> 00:53:39.450
It seems to really be the case
that knowing that somebody will

00:53:39.450 --> 00:53:44.040
be paid is really not helping
workers or making workers

00:53:44.040 --> 00:53:47.722
more productive both in the
form of their relationship

00:53:47.722 --> 00:53:49.680
or due to their relationship
with the employer,

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:59.297
but also due to other effects,
including perhaps their worries

00:53:59.297 --> 00:54:01.380
or concerns that they might
have about [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:05.070
So it seems to be that
similarly from the Mani et al.

00:54:05.070 --> 00:54:09.100
paper, when workers
have done their harvest

00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:12.060
and you have the
harvest in front of you

00:54:12.060 --> 00:54:15.330
and it's worth so
many rupees, that

00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:17.977
doesn't seem to increase
their cognitive scores.

00:54:17.977 --> 00:54:19.560
That's what I was
showing you earlier.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.350
Really what it seems to be is
you have to be actually paid.

00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:25.240
So once workers actually
have the cash in hand, only

00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.505
then their cognitive
function goes up.

00:54:27.505 --> 00:54:29.130
There seems to be
something [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:34.455
about this [INAUDIBLE] example
I have for you is suppose

00:54:34.455 --> 00:54:35.580
you have to pay your bills.

00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:37.800
Suppose you don't
have enough money.

00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:39.400
And then, on the
first of the month,

00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:41.400
you're going to be paid
your stipend or whatever

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.460
as a student.

00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:46.140
There's something distinctly
different from having actually

00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.990
been paid the money
on your bank account

00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:49.860
than having it in
your possession

00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:52.313
that is yours or being
sent a check or whatever,

00:54:52.313 --> 00:54:54.480
as opposed to knowing it's
going to come in two days

00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:57.030
and you have your
outstanding credit card bills

00:54:57.030 --> 00:54:59.300
even if you know that
you can pay them.

00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:01.050
That's, in some sense,
from introspection,

00:55:01.050 --> 00:55:03.427
the best example I have for you.

00:55:03.427 --> 00:55:05.010
But it seems to be--
and you're right.

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:06.000
In some sense, there
could have been

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
some effect of just telling
workers you're going

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.742
to be paid early versus later.

00:55:09.742 --> 00:55:11.200
But it doesn't seem
to be the case.

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.590
This really seems to be
the case of receiving

00:55:13.590 --> 00:55:15.300
the money, having
cash in hand, and then

00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.010
being able to pay
the money lender

00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:19.410
or pay essentially some
person that you owe

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:21.840
money, some money back,
seems to be what's

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:32.780
quite important for generating
those kinds of effects OK

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:35.393
so let's move on

00:55:35.393 --> 00:55:36.560
I already talked about this.

00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.935
Essentially, yeah,
so there seems

00:55:37.935 --> 00:55:40.910
to be these large
effects of ultra

00:55:40.910 --> 00:55:43.160
poor programs, which
seem to say that there

00:55:43.160 --> 00:55:46.790
might be some underlying
behavioral or other poverty

00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:48.045
trap going on.

00:55:48.045 --> 00:55:49.920
And sort of we don't
have the answer to that,

00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.480
but one hypothesis is that some
of the underlying psychological

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:58.150
issues might be
responsible for that.

00:55:58.150 --> 00:56:01.840
Now, what are other poverty
induced deprivation?

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.840
So poverty entails a bunch
of different deprivations

00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:07.540
beyond money, including
malnutrition, high levels

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:10.040
of stress, sleep deprivation.

00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:12.620
People's sleeping conditions
tend to be terrible.

00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:16.790
Noise pollution, the poor are
more disproportionately exposed

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:17.750
to noise.

00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.640
There's environmental
pollution, in particular air,

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.100
that the poor are
much more exposed to.

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.470
Heat, the poor often
don't have access

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:30.200
to heat and/or temperature
more generally.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:34.440
The poor are more exposed
to high temperature

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.440
and don't have
access to ACs often.

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.330
There is also some form
of stigma and exclusion,

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:43.140
which might have certain
cognitive and other effects.

00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:47.900
There's some evidence of
disproportionate substance

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:48.400
abuse.

00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:54.930
I've shown you some evidence of
increased excessive drinking.

00:56:54.930 --> 00:56:57.900
And there's also quite
a bit of evidence

00:56:57.900 --> 00:57:03.890
of increased mental illness,
especially among the poor.

00:57:03.890 --> 00:57:06.530
So within any given
location, the poor

00:57:06.530 --> 00:57:09.630
are disproportionately
affected by mental illness,

00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:12.750
including things like
depression and anxiety.

00:57:12.750 --> 00:57:15.500
But there's a bunch of
research in other settings

00:57:15.500 --> 00:57:21.320
that shows that each of these
factors affect either health

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.090
and/or cognitive function.

00:57:23.090 --> 00:57:25.670
And so you might wonder how are
these factors then affecting

00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:28.280
people's decision
making and choices.

00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.170
And just to give you
some example of this,

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:33.000
this is some work that
we have done in Chennai.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.610
So to give some sense
of what this looks like,

00:57:35.610 --> 00:57:38.250
the poor essentially tend to
have very, very challenging

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:39.600
sleeping conditions.

00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.670
There's dust, noise, mosquitoes.

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:42.930
People sleep in the same room.

00:57:42.930 --> 00:57:45.540
People sleep outside in
the middle of the street.

00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:47.430
And it's hot.

00:57:47.430 --> 00:57:48.990
There's people
sleeping on the floor.

00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:51.750
So essentially, any
challenging sleeping conditions

00:57:51.750 --> 00:57:54.790
that you can think of you can
find it among the urban poor.

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:56.950
And so one question
you might ask is,

00:57:56.950 --> 00:58:01.710
well, then does this
lack of good sleep affect

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:06.808
people's capacity to work
and their decision making?

00:58:06.808 --> 00:58:08.350
And so in our study,
what we do is we

00:58:08.350 --> 00:58:10.870
objectively measure sleep
quantity and quality

00:58:10.870 --> 00:58:11.820
in Chennai.

00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:13.960
And we document severe
sleep deprivation

00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:17.810
and alarmingly low quality
of sleep in is setting.

00:58:17.810 --> 00:58:18.970
What do I mean by this?

00:58:18.970 --> 00:58:22.690
People sleep on average
about 6.5 hours per night.

00:58:22.690 --> 00:58:25.390
And the quality of
this sleep is low,

00:58:25.390 --> 00:58:30.370
which one measurement of that
is their fraction of time

00:58:30.370 --> 00:58:34.180
that they sleep along the
time that they spend in bed

00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:35.440
is about 70%.

00:58:35.440 --> 00:58:38.020
That's what's referred
to as sleep efficiency.

00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:41.540
Sleep efficiency is way
higher in rich countries.

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.820
It's about 85% to 90%.

00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:49.560
So if the rich spend an hour
in bed, they spend about 55

00:58:49.560 --> 00:58:51.420
or something minutes asleep.

00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:55.570
If the poor do that, it's
about 40 something minutes.

00:58:55.570 --> 00:58:57.630
So essentially, there's
lots of awakenings.

00:58:57.630 --> 00:58:59.670
And as a consequence,
in our sample,

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:03.900
people seem about 5 and
1/2 hours per night.

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:06.420
Now, then what we do is
we have two interventions

00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.550
to increase sleep
and provide people

00:59:08.550 --> 00:59:12.780
information, sleep devices,
which is mattress, ear

00:59:12.780 --> 00:59:14.310
plugs, eye shields, and so on.

00:59:14.310 --> 00:59:17.580
And we increased sleep by quite
a bit for about three weeks.

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:20.310
And in this experiment, we
also have an intervention

00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:22.560
of a nap intervention
that offers people naps

00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:28.470
at the office, which provides
high quantity and high quality

00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:30.270
of sleep in that setting.

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:32.970
Now, what we find then
is, somewhat surprisingly,

00:59:32.970 --> 00:59:34.980
that actually increasing
people's sleep

00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:35.880
does very little.

00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:39.120
So people sleep about 20 to
30 minutes more every night

00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.380
for three weeks.

00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.760
And we measure the labor supply.

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.870
We hire them for
about that time.

00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:48.050
People are not doing better
in any way in terms of people

00:59:48.050 --> 00:59:48.950
not working more.

00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:50.370
People are not more productive.

00:59:50.370 --> 00:59:52.620
People are not doing
better in cognitive tasks.

00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:54.670
They're not happier
and so on and so forth.

00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:57.170
They also don't make
different decisions.

00:59:57.170 --> 00:59:59.900
And if anything, you know, they
decrease their labor supply.

00:59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.940
They actually work fewer hours.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:02.573
Why is that?

01:00:02.573 --> 01:00:04.490
Well, because people are
spending so much more

01:00:04.490 --> 01:00:07.940
time in bed, they have now less
time available during the day.

01:00:07.940 --> 01:00:12.960
And some of that time goes
into working fewer hours.

01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:15.240
Now, in contrast,
the nap treatment

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.760
has pretty large effects on
the productivity, attention,

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.820
well-being, patience, and so on.

01:00:19.820 --> 01:00:23.100
So it's not sleep cannot affect
people's outcomes in these

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:23.940
settings.

01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:25.935
But rather, a night
sleep, as it is

01:00:25.935 --> 01:00:29.280
does not really do very much, at
least the type of night's sleep

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.110
that people are getting.

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:35.490
And so what we then provide
some evidence of that what's

01:00:35.490 --> 01:00:37.320
really important
here or the reason

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.930
why people's sleep
does not do very much

01:00:39.930 --> 01:00:44.530
in increasing their productivity
or improving their outcomes

01:00:44.530 --> 01:00:47.470
is because the quality
of sleep is so low.

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:49.360
So let me sort of
look at the sample

01:00:49.360 --> 01:00:52.150
and look at people who sleep
better and worse at baseline

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:53.770
at the beginning of the study.

01:00:53.770 --> 01:00:56.020
People who sleep better at
the beginning of the study,

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.330
they actually tend to have
reasonably large effects

01:00:58.330 --> 01:00:59.740
on their productivity.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.380
In contrast, people
who have bad sleep

01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.475
to start with, for them,
essentially increasing

01:01:04.475 --> 01:01:08.510
their sleep does nothing and
potentially makes things worse.

01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:09.430
So what did we learn?

01:01:09.430 --> 01:01:12.190
I do not want you to take
away that sleeping does not

01:01:12.190 --> 01:01:13.110
do anything.

01:01:13.110 --> 01:01:15.670
MIT students are
chronically undersleeping.

01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:19.630
And you could be probably
sleeping more, all of you,

01:01:19.630 --> 01:01:21.130
or most of you.

01:01:21.130 --> 01:01:23.710
Essentially, what
we learn from this

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:26.950
is that, when people's sleep
conditions are really terrible,

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:32.400
well, then increasing
one's sleep actually

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.430
doesn't do very much.

01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:35.952
The return on sleeping
is just very, very low.

01:01:35.952 --> 01:01:37.410
And so what we
learn, in some ways,

01:01:37.410 --> 01:01:40.650
that the poor, at
least in this setting,

01:01:40.650 --> 01:01:43.740
are actually doing as well as
they could, in a sense of they

01:01:43.740 --> 01:01:44.907
do the best they can.

01:01:44.907 --> 01:01:47.490
And since sleep is so bad, is
so terrible, people sleep really

01:01:47.490 --> 01:01:51.900
badly, increasing their
sleep does not do very much.

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:54.450
That's not to say, if you
actually fix their sleeping

01:01:54.450 --> 01:01:56.940
conditions, if you put
everybody into a nice hotel

01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:59.760
or a nice bedroom or
give them a nice house

01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.740
and help them sleep
better, that wouldn't

01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:03.810
have potentially large effects.

01:02:03.810 --> 01:02:06.668
But the study that we
conducted was not doing that.

01:02:06.668 --> 01:02:08.460
The study that we
conducted was essentially

01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:10.710
saying, take your sleep
conditions as given.

01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:12.150
And look at what
happens when you

01:02:12.150 --> 01:02:16.740
increase people's sleep duration
for given sleep quality.

01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:18.810
And that doesn't do very much.

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:21.420
In contrast, as I
showed you or told you,

01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:25.020
naps seem to be quite effective
in having a large number

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:29.310
or range of effects, which
seems to say that sleep can

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:31.060
potentially matter quite a bit.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:34.380
But what really is important is
try to figure out how could we

01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:36.930
perhaps increase people's
sleep quality which might

01:02:36.930 --> 01:02:38.392
have then important effects.

01:02:38.392 --> 01:02:40.350
Sorry, that was a lot of
information, more than

01:02:40.350 --> 01:02:42.060
I perhaps intended.

01:02:42.060 --> 01:02:43.110
Any questions on that?

01:02:58.050 --> 01:03:00.660
OK, so then the
last piece, which

01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:04.770
I'm going to just sort of
say a little bit about,

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:09.750
is a paper that we just
finished on the relationship

01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:13.290
between poverty and
common mental disorders

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:16.920
as they're referred to, which
is anxiety and depression.

01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:19.650
And what we there
sort of argue--

01:03:19.650 --> 01:03:22.830
and it's a pretty short
paper if you're interested.

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:27.832
I'll, in fact, put it
on my website tonight.

01:03:27.832 --> 01:03:29.790
We're looking at,
essentially, the relationship

01:03:29.790 --> 01:03:33.030
between poverty and
these two conditions.

01:03:33.030 --> 01:03:35.520
And what we do is, first,
we show the causal effect

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.017
in both directions.

01:03:37.017 --> 01:03:38.850
And so there's quite a
bit of evidence that,

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:42.402
essentially, being poor is bad
for people's mental health.

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:43.610
And these are causal studies.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:46.290
So for example, providing
people cash transfers

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:49.150
improves consistently
their mental health.

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:51.600
So there's a causal effective
from not having money

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.917
on people's mental health
and anxiety and depression.

01:03:54.917 --> 01:03:56.625
At the same time,
there's a causal effect

01:03:56.625 --> 01:04:01.590
of anxiety and depression
on people's ability

01:04:01.590 --> 01:04:05.440
to earn income and,
thus, their poverty.

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:08.010
So for example, if you
provide people with CBT

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:11.760
or some other forms
of psychotherapy,

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:15.670
that reduces their depression.

01:04:15.670 --> 01:04:18.340
And then, in turn, it
increases their labor supply,

01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:21.000
which in turn presumably
increases their ability

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.570
to earn income.

01:04:22.570 --> 01:04:25.200
So there's causal effects in
both directions from poverty

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.220
to common mental disorders and
from common mental disorders

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:30.960
to poverty.

01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:33.600
And then what the paper does
in a lot more detail is then

01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.490
think about what are
different mechanisms

01:04:35.490 --> 01:04:39.390
for this causal relationship
and what exactly, what evidence,

01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:42.040
do they actually have of that.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.110
And so on the side from poverty
and from economic conditions

01:04:46.110 --> 01:04:48.270
to mental health,
there's a number

01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:51.510
of different issues that could
be quite important ranging

01:04:51.510 --> 01:04:54.870
from stresses or just being
exposed to lots of shocks

01:04:54.870 --> 01:04:57.630
and, therefore,
worries and uncertainty

01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:58.823
to environmental conditions.

01:04:58.823 --> 01:05:00.240
In particular,
there's quite a bit

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.830
of emerging evidence
of pollution

01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:03.800
being bad for people's
mental health,

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.650
so essentially pollution
causing depression, for example.

01:05:08.650 --> 01:05:11.250
There's some potential
for physical health,

01:05:11.250 --> 01:05:13.635
just being in bad health.

01:05:13.635 --> 01:05:16.350
It might be bad for your
mental health in part

01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:21.130
because it causes physical
pain and other illnesses.

01:05:21.130 --> 01:05:25.090
There's some evidence
of early life conditions

01:05:25.090 --> 01:05:27.070
growing up in
poverty tends to be

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:28.550
bad for people's mental health.

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:31.900
And there's some nice
evidence of shocks

01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:37.630
to mothers' and fathers' income
might cause mental illness much

01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:40.090
later in life for the children.

01:05:40.090 --> 01:05:42.970
There's quite a bit of evidence
of trauma, violence, and crime,

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.530
which the poor are
disproportionately

01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:46.940
exposed to, affecting
people's mental health.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:49.660
And finally, social status,
shame, and isolation,

01:05:49.660 --> 01:05:53.950
if you sort of stigmatize
and isolate from society,

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:55.930
that might be bad for
your mental health.

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:57.910
Particular, sort of
relative comparisons

01:05:57.910 --> 01:06:00.020
could be quite important.

01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:02.020
And then at the
same time, there are

01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:03.640
effects in the other
directions coming

01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:06.800
from depression and anxiety.

01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:10.420
So one profound way in which
depression and anxiety affect

01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:14.320
people's behavior is cognitive
function, the way people think.

01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:18.490
So in contrast to other
things such as health,

01:06:18.490 --> 01:06:21.910
depression and anxiety
affect the way people think.

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:24.020
And then that might
affect people's beliefs,

01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.810
their confidence,
overconfidence,

01:06:25.810 --> 01:06:27.580
underconfidence,
belief updating,

01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:30.220
all the stuff that we talked
about in the class as well

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:33.040
as their preferences, and time
preferences, risk preferences,

01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:35.150
social preferences, and so on.

01:06:35.150 --> 01:06:38.290
It might affect their labor
productivity, their labor

01:06:38.290 --> 01:06:41.260
supply, how much people work,
and how productive they are.

01:06:41.260 --> 01:06:44.770
Of course, people might be
very stigmatized and treated

01:06:44.770 --> 01:06:51.670
badly because of mental illness,
which in addition sort of then

01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:55.030
makes people less likely
to seek help potentially.

01:06:55.030 --> 01:06:56.783
Because if you're
then stigmatized,

01:06:56.783 --> 01:06:58.700
you might not want to
declare to your employer

01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.690
or to anybody else
that you're depressed.

01:07:01.690 --> 01:07:05.710
People tend to have worse health
conditions if they're depressed

01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:09.110
or they suffer from mental
illness or other health

01:07:09.110 --> 01:07:12.390
conditions tend to get
worse, health expenditures.

01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:14.970
There's also some
evidence of depression

01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:17.220
affecting women's empowerment.

01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:20.500
I think there's two
potential channels here.

01:07:20.500 --> 01:07:23.670
One is that women are, in fact,
disproportionately affected

01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:26.710
by depression,
anxiety, and so on.

01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:29.430
So the measured
prevalence is about twice

01:07:29.430 --> 01:07:32.790
as high and sort of to
the extent that now,

01:07:32.790 --> 01:07:37.160
if you improve
people's mental health,

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.053
women will disproportionately
benefit from that.

01:07:40.053 --> 01:07:41.720
And then there's
evidence that, once you

01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:44.630
do that, women have
higher bargaining

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:50.070
power in the household, more
say about resources spent

01:07:50.070 --> 01:07:52.170
and so on and so forth.

01:07:52.170 --> 01:07:54.440
And then finally,
potentially quite important

01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:56.480
is effects on young people.

01:07:56.480 --> 01:07:59.900
This ranges from primary
and secondary school

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:03.330
age to college
students and so on,

01:08:03.330 --> 01:08:08.180
which is to say that a lot
of mental health conditions

01:08:08.180 --> 01:08:09.920
appear during adolescence.

01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:12.800
And so those are often when
very critical decisions are made

01:08:12.800 --> 01:08:14.142
when it comes to education.

01:08:14.142 --> 01:08:15.225
Do you drop out of school?

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:18.229
Do you go to college
and so on and so forth?

01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:21.050
It turns out there's
actually quite not

01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:22.729
a lot of causal
evidence on this,

01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:26.840
but it seems very plausible that
this could be quite important.

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.620
And sort of taking
these things together,

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.310
it seems to be that poverty,
through various different

01:08:31.310 --> 01:08:33.950
channels, including
scarcity, which I showed you

01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:35.870
at the beginning,
but also including

01:08:35.870 --> 01:08:38.450
all these other conditions
might affect profoundly

01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:41.180
the [INAUDIBLE] and
how they make decisions

01:08:41.180 --> 01:08:43.490
and how productive they are
at work, which then could

01:08:43.490 --> 01:08:46.520
reinforced poverty
and make it harder

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.401
for people to become richer.

01:08:49.401 --> 01:08:50.609
This is a lot of information.

01:08:50.609 --> 01:08:52.080
So any questions?

01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:54.859
I'm happy to discuss
or answer any questions

01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:55.819
that you would have.

01:08:55.819 --> 01:08:58.430
I'm not expecting you to
remember all of those things.

01:08:58.430 --> 01:09:00.350
I was just more
elaborating for anybody

01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:01.740
who might be interested.

01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:05.683
You can also read all of
those things in the paper

01:09:05.683 --> 01:09:07.800
that I'll add to the
course website as well.

01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:25.520
All right, so on
Wednesday, we're

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:28.310
going to talk about
happiness and mental health.

01:09:28.310 --> 01:09:30.859
Please read the paper
by Kahneman and Deaton.

01:09:30.859 --> 01:09:32.760
Notice I just changed
this in the syllabus.

01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:34.203
So if you have an old
version of the syllabus,

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:35.870
please make sure you
read the new paper.

01:09:35.870 --> 01:09:39.250
I think it was very short, so
it shouldn't be tricky to read.

01:09:39.250 --> 01:09:42.800
Essentially, it's looking
at what kinds of things

01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.770
predict whether people
are happy or not.

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:50.500
And then on Monday, we're
going to talk about policy

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.740
with behavioral agents.

01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:56.380
Just as a reminder,
we have a guest

01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.370
at the end of class next time.

01:09:58.370 --> 01:10:00.290
I hope the guests
will come at 2:20.

01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:04.780
I'm hoping for a
lama to visit us,

01:10:04.780 --> 01:10:06.100
but it could also be a goat.

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.590
We'll see how that goes.

01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:10.963
Any questions or comments?

01:10:10.963 --> 01:10:12.630
When it comes to
depression and anxiety,

01:10:12.630 --> 01:10:14.922
specifically I'm going to
talk about it more generally.

01:10:14.922 --> 01:10:17.560
So one of the things I'm
working on, for example,

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:21.780
is looking at the impact of
cognitive behavioral therapy

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:25.410
or other psychotherapies to
improve people's mental health

01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:28.770
and then look at the effects
on people's beliefs, how

01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:31.350
confident are they
in themselves,

01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:32.820
how they update their beliefs.

01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:36.000
And remember, we have this stuff
from [INAUDIBLE] and others

01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:39.270
about asymmetric
belief updating and is

01:10:39.270 --> 01:10:42.630
that affected, for example,
by people's mental health.

01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:44.190
Moreover, we look
at preferences,

01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:45.960
which is precisely
time preferences,

01:10:45.960 --> 01:10:48.240
social preferences,
risk preferences.

01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:52.110
And once you improve
people's depression,

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:57.240
does that affect people's time
social and risk preference?

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.500
More broadly, there's quite
a few people trying to do

01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:03.110
studies-- and I'll run
through this fairly quickly--

01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:07.960
to look at these types of
effects, which, for example,

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.710
there's some work
around malnutrition that

01:11:09.710 --> 01:11:12.980
shows, once you provide
people with more calories,

01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:18.510
there's some indications of
less discounting, which is kind

01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:22.680
of what you're alluding to.

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.360
There's some work
on the relationship

01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.655
between stress and discounting.

01:11:25.655 --> 01:11:27.780
There's actually not much
evidence or less evidence

01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.160
than you would expect.

01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:31.500
For sleep deprivation,
for example, we find,

01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:35.058
when people nap, they're
less present biased compared

01:11:35.058 --> 01:11:36.225
to when they haven't napped.

01:11:39.530 --> 01:11:41.290
For example, for
alcohol consumption,

01:11:41.290 --> 01:11:42.700
I do find that people save more.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:44.960
And it seems to be not
driven by having more money.

01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:47.440
So again, that seems to be
consistent with people's time

01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.830
preference in some way
affected by these conditions.

01:11:50.830 --> 01:11:52.990
Overall, there's quite
a bit of evidence

01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:55.820
so far on productivity.

01:11:55.820 --> 01:11:58.630
So papers essentially show that,
when you're disproportionately

01:11:58.630 --> 01:12:02.980
exposed to heat, people
are less productive.

01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:03.970
People learn less.

01:12:03.970 --> 01:12:06.590
When you're exposed to noise,
people are less productive.

01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:09.370
When people have less
nutrition, they're

01:12:09.370 --> 01:12:12.500
less productive and
so on and so forth.

01:12:12.500 --> 01:12:16.000
There's less evidence, so far,
on decision making and sort

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:17.410
of preferences overall.

01:12:17.410 --> 01:12:19.377
That's what people are
currently working on,

01:12:19.377 --> 01:12:20.710
but that's exactly the question.

01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:23.380
Can we sort of explained
potentially some of this stuff

01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:26.000
that I was mentioning at the
very beginning of the lecture?

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:29.080
Can we explain potentially
certain behavioral biases

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.350
or certain deviations from
the neoclassical model

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:36.690
by alleviating or addressing
some of the psychological

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:37.510
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:39.910
We don't have a lot of
evidence, but we hope

01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:44.030
to have some more [INAUDIBLE].

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:47.050
But that's exactly what
people are working on.

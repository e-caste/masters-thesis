00:00:25.732 --> 00:00:33.280
PROFESSOR: What I want to do
today is to build on the movie

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.010
and the discussion
we had last time.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.970
So I think in the movie, a lot
of themes appear that are also

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.030
in the chapter on health,
if you've read it.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.650
A lot of the themes are kind
there, but in sort of some

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.870
random way.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.200
And in the discussion we have
had, we also have elaborated

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.050
on the themes, but now what I
want to do is to try and put

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.330
them all together in a coherent
frame, give you a bit

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:06.190
more of specific examples that
are in the book specifically.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.550
And we're, of course, going to
be talking about health in

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:16.220
particular with the angle of how
people choose which health

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.180
care to access, how people
choose what doctors to see for

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.620
what, why people are not doing
more preventive care in

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.690
investments, and things
like that.

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.870
Obviously, we are not doctors,
so we are not talking about

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.680
health from the point of view
of what could treat people.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.310
We are taking this as given, and
then wonder how do we get

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.960
this stuff that can
treat people out

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.710
there in the landscape.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.050
So we start with these things.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.320
They are some technologies that
are known, that have been

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.660
demonstrated in [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.200
trials to be effective
and cheap ways to

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.720
promote good health.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.220
Some examples of that include
bed nets to prevent malaria,

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:08.960
would include immunization,
which costs a maximum of maybe

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.610
$15 to $20 per child, and it's
one of the cheapest ways to

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.730
prevent child death.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.730
Breast feeding, which of
course is free and is

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.510
recommended by WHO to be done
from one hour after birth

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.350
until six months, at least in
places where the water is not

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.680
very clean.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.020
Oral rehydration solution, which
is basically a mix of

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.960
sugar and salt that you put in
water when they kid comes with

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.980
acute diarrhea.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.690
That's not going to cure
whatever caused the diarrhea,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.740
but it's going to prevent
dehydration, which is the main

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.150
reason why people
die of diarrhea.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.990
And bleach, chlorine, that
you put in your water.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.700
These are just a few examples
of things that have been

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.660
demonstrated to be effective,
and cost-effective, and cheap,

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.440
and accessible.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:09.470
And one of the major puzzle and
frustration that we see in

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.170
world health is that these
investments just don't really

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.070
reach people, are not really
undertaken by people.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.660
And so the question is, why?

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.180
It's certainly not because
they are not useful.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.980
They save lives.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.920
So you could argue what's
the value of a life?

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.330
Maybe it's not so
much worth it.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.130
But the value of a life would
have been very, very low for

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.230
these things not
to be worth it.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.590
But even if you leave that
behind, conditional on

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.850
surviving, you're going to do
much better if you have not

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:49.520
been very sick all through
your childhood.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.100
We've seen that for deworming.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.100
We've seen that if kids were
dewormed when they were

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.750
children, they were not sick
with worms, they are making

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.210
23% more every year, which
sounds to be like a

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.820
fantastically good
rate of return.

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:11.020
We're talking about the maybe
$1,400 in current dollars over

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.420
a child's lifetime for an
investment of less than $1.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.920
And the same argument that
malaria also makes country's

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.770
poor and people poor has been
made for malaria by Jeff

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.870
Sachs, and Gallup who was also a
researcher at Harvard at the

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.990
time when Sachs was there at
the time, found that if you

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.850
control for other factors,
malarial countries, the

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.070
countries where malaria is
prevalent, have a GDP that is

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.860
30% lower than non-malarial
countries.

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.360
And what are the
other factors?

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.890
They are geography, latitude,
the climate, things like that.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.980
You can actually see it on a
map from Gallup and Sachs

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.720
where it shows where malaria is
prevalent, at least where

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.040
it was in 1965.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:07.890
And you can see that there is a
fair amount of bad luck that

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:09.340
is involved with malaria.

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.140
If you're in between the topics,
you're just much more

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.560
likely to be infected with
malaria simply because this is

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.730
environment where the mosquitoes
that carry the

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.350
malaria thrive.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.380
So there used to be a lot of
malaria in Latin America.

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.080
There used to be malaria in the
American South once upon a

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.800
time, which is somewhat
above the tropic.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.440
But otherwise, most of the
malaria is in Africa, Latin

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.990
America, India, and
Southeast Asia.

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:41.350
Keep this figure in
mind, that this is

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.510
where malaria is important.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.850
And now if we look
at GDP in 1994--

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.630
oh no, that's malaria
in 1994-- it got

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.640
better in Latin America.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.570
It didn't get much
better in Africa.

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.440
It got worse in India.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.200
And this is GDP per
capita in 1995.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.990
And you can see that you have
a striking reversal of the

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.750
colors, which is the countries
that are very dark in the

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.210
malaria picture are now
very light in the

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.330
GDP per capita picture.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.880
So the results that he found in
the regression, [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.290
statistical bells and whistles,
is just translation

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:23.690
of that picture that basically
the dark countries in the

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:28.130
malaria picture are the light
countries in the GDP picture.

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:30.240
So that is no doubt
about this fact.

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.740
So on the [INAUDIBLE], this
article was very influential.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.400
It was published in 2001.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:43.400
Was very influential to bring
a push for the fight against

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:51.820
malaria as an economic type of
intervention that has a decent

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.720
rate of return.

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.760
Naturally you should do not for
compassion value, but for

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.710
economic purpose, fight malaria,
use bed nets and

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.100
things like that.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:03.390
Now some people obviously
objected to that, saying,

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:07.460
well, that's not necessarily
a proof that malaria

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.210
causes the low GDP.

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.010
And what else could
be going on?

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:14.490
What else did they argue
was going on?

00:07:17.442 --> 00:07:20.886
AUDIENCE: Is it possible that
is poor so it isn't able to

00:07:20.886 --> 00:07:22.854
fight malaria?

00:07:22.854 --> 00:07:27.036
So it has malaria because it has
[INAUDIBLE] below GDP, not

00:07:27.036 --> 00:07:27.920
the other way around?

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:28.170
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:30.690
It cold be that it takes some
money to fight malaria.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.190
In fact, that's exactly what
Sachs is arguing, that it

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.860
takes some money to fight
malaria, so we need to help

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.290
the poor country.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:40.920
And in fact, when you look at
the countries that got malaria

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:46.270
in 1965 and don't get it in
'94, or if you look at the

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.370
country that had little of
malaria in '65 and have a lot

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:55.020
in '94, this is some kind
of tracking pattern.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.120
Basically, it mostly
disappeared--

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.020
not entirely, but mostly
disappeared--

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.160
in Latin America between 1965
and 1994, and nothing happened

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.520
in most of Africa.

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.130
In India, it actually increased
between 1965 and

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:15.050
1994, but the same increase
didn't happen in Sri Lanka,

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.020
which is the little dot
that is next to

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.160
India on the map here.

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.640
So why is it the case that given
the similar geographic

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.800
circumstances, in a sense, Latin
America managed to get

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:28.880
rid of malaria, but
not Africa?

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.129
Why is it the case that malaria
increased in India in

00:08:32.129 --> 00:08:34.270
the same time it reduced
in Sri Lanka?

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.419
That's not entirely explained
by geography.

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:39.435
In fact, for the most part, it's
not explain by geography.

00:08:39.435 --> 00:08:42.919
It is explained by the fact that
in Latin America, there

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:47.820
have been very sustained, large
effort to fight malaria

00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.120
that we are going to talk
about in a moment.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.030
They just basically
sprayed extremely

00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:55.070
aggressively with DDT.

00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:56.370
They drained the swamps.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.750
They did all sorts of things
like that which managed to

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:02.040
control malaria, and they
managed to do it.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.110
And the same thing happened
in Sri Lanka.

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:08.330
So if you compare Sri Lanka, for
example, and Tamil Nadu,

00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.180
which is the part of India that
just faces Sri Lanka, for

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.670
the most part has the
same people--

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.945
at least part of Sri Lanka is
Tamil, even though they are

00:09:15.945 --> 00:09:19.870
not very pleased to be there--

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:23.940
in Sri Lanka you had very
aggressive control of malaria

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.080
and pretty much the
disappearance of malaria.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:28.620
In the meantime, in Tamil Nadu,
right next door with a

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.060
similar climate, your
get if anything

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.910
an increase of malaria.

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:35.240
And so this is not due to
geography or anything.

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:39.020
This is due to politics, and
your ability to organize your

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:41.140
people, and to organize
your country, and to

00:09:41.140 --> 00:09:43.120
get something done.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.790
And so it is likely to be the
case that if you're able to

00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.260
get something done to control
malaria, you're just able to

00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:53.230
get something done in general.

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.380
And if you're not able to get
something done with malaria,

00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:58.110
you're not able to get something
done in general.

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:02.020
So maybe the same countries--
and this is not only true for

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:02.700
Sri Lanka--

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.510
that at the same time they
managed to control malaria,

00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:09.520
they were also extremely
effective in getting out

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.050
preventive care for their
people, immunizations for

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.980
their people, preschools,
and things like that.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.185
So Sri Lanka has a lot of
political problems, but from

00:10:19.185 --> 00:10:23.610
the point of view of a country
that delivers social services

00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.690
to their country, it's actually
quite effective.

00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.770
So it's certainly the same
countries that have managed to

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:31.940
control malaria have managed to
do other good things, and

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.030
maybe this is why they have
[INAUDIBLE] in 1995.

00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:37.910
So on its own, this correlation
is certainly not

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.360
sufficient to tell us that
there is a cause.

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:46.600
So before moving further, I want
to be able to answer this

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:49.730
question, which is we know that
the malarial countries

00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:53.100
are 30% poorer than the
non-malarial countries.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.340
To what extent can we say it is
due to malaria, and to what

00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.660
extent is this the reverse
causality that the countries

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.810
that were good at controlling
malaria also managed to do

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:09.060
other good things?

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:18.080
And we can answer this question
precisely by looking

00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:21.730
at those episodes where my
malaria was eradicated,

00:11:21.730 --> 00:11:26.830
because malaria was eradicated
by very clear, specific action

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:29.810
that was taken at some point
in those countries.

00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:34.020
And there are a series of
papers, one on the Americas,

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:40.730
which is the one we are going
to study now, one on what is

00:11:40.730 --> 00:11:42.340
called malarial peripheries--

00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:46.650
so that's Paraguay, Sri Lanka,
and one in India--

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.120
that looks at those eradication
campaigns and

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.950
tries to look at what is the
impact for a child of having

00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:58.780
been born in a place that used
to be malarial after the

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.890
eradication campaign
rather than before.

00:12:03.570 --> 00:12:10.320
So let's look at a very nice
study that is the study about

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.660
Latin America.

00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:14.240
It's a study by a researcher
in Chicago called Hoyt

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:20.710
Bleakley, and what he looks
at is DDT spraying.

00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:23.570
This is also interesting because
actually the question

00:12:23.570 --> 00:12:28.030
of DDT spraying is a pretty
controversial one today,

00:12:28.030 --> 00:12:31.080
because it's now pretty much
forbidden anywhere to spray

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:35.470
anything with DDT, because it's
not very good for you to

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:37.480
eat food that has been
sprayed with DDT.

00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:40.440
On the other hand, maybe it's
also not very good for you to

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.230
get malaria.

00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.220
PROFESSOR: So there is a little
bit of a conflict

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:47.530
between those two objectives
with a lot of people are

00:12:47.530 --> 00:12:50.430
saying we should go back
to DDT and a lot of

00:12:50.430 --> 00:12:51.930
people saying no.

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.370
For example, there is a huge
political fight in Uganda

00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:58.610
between the organic farmers and
the rest of the country,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:12:59.420
essentially.

00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:03.130
The organic farmers don't want
any DDT anywhere near their

00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:06.660
crop, obviously, because in
that case the European

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:12.360
community would put a stop
on their export to

00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.160
other European Union.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.580
And so any effort of eradicating
malaria with

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.990
spraying of DDT has been
stopped in Uganda.

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:24.850
But at the time, they were not
so worried about that, so

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:28.570
there was a big eradication
campaign in Latin America that

00:13:28.570 --> 00:13:33.070
started around 1955 partly with
international funding.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:35.860
And so they sprayed everywhere,
and they made sure

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.660
to try and get rid of
malaria everywhere.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:43.010
They even sprayed under people's
roofs, like in the

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:45.100
eaves of a house,
the mosquito's

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.980
nest under the roof.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:50.670
So they went there and put the
DDT there, which is probably

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:53.590
not excellent for people's
health directly, but very bad

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.840
for the mosquitoes for sure.

00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:02.980
What the Bleakley study does is
to exploit the fact that if

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:05.880
you started in a region where
there was not so malaria to

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.330
start with, then the decline
in malaria was lower.

00:14:09.330 --> 00:14:13.850
So here is one example
for Columbia.

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:18.330
This is cases of malaria
in Colombia by year.

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:21.400
You can see that in 1950, you
had a lot of malaria cases

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:22.630
every year.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:26.820
The campaign started
roughly in 1955.

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:31.900
Intensive spraying started in
1958, and you start getting a

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.680
huge drop in the cases of
malaria country-wide.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:36.800
So it's pretty effective.

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:42.200
Basically you go from 600 cases,
I think it's a month,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.060
to about nothing, to close to
nothing, and that happened in

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:49.100
a very short period of time.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:52.660
You could look at people born on
those times, but of course,

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:54.870
other things happen over time,
so we don't really

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:56.710
want to do that only.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:15:00.790
But what you can do then is to
say, well, now let's look at

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:06.050
regions that got more malaria
before the campaign, and this

00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:08.400
is the reduction in the
number of malaria

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.710
cases in those regions.

00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:13.650
And of course, the more malaria
you got, the bigger

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:16.010
the reduction, because
the reduction was

00:15:16.010 --> 00:15:17.880
pretty much to zero.

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:21.220
So if you started with 100, you
get about 100% reduction,

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.770
like in this place, Choco.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.530
If you started with no malaria
at all, t then you get no

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:28.300
reduction because there
was nowhere to go.

00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:31.370
It's a little bit
like the anemia

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:32.290
paper that we saw before.

00:15:32.290 --> 00:15:35.380
If you started anemic, then
getting the pill makes you

00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:37.720
non-anemic, but if you're
non-anemic, you don't benefit.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.220
Same thing here.

00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:41.860
This graph is by region,
so these are

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.520
all different regions--

00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.300
Choco, Cauca, Narino,
Santander--

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.240
these are all regions.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:52.860
And you can see that the regions
that had a lot of

00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.310
malaria before the eradication
got the biggest reduction

00:15:56.310 --> 00:15:59.180
between the post-campaign
to the pre-campaign.

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.760
So this is the reduction in
cases, and this is where you

00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.650
started from.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:09.050
So now what it's going to look
at is it the case-- take a

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:14.580
child who was born and who was
still a child before the

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:18.890
eradication campaign started,
and take a child who was born

00:16:18.890 --> 00:16:21.560
after the eradication
campaign.

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.690
So take a child who was, let's
say, 10 by 1960 and a child

00:16:25.690 --> 00:16:27.980
who was born in 1962.

00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:31.730
And the child who is 10 by 1960
doesn't benefit from the

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:35.580
campaign whatsoever, but the
child who was born in 1962, by

00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.090
the time he's born, malaria
is history.

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:43.230
So the young child relative to
the old child would benefit

00:16:43.230 --> 00:16:46.810
more in a region where malaria
was a big problem than in a

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:49.390
region when it was
a small problem.

00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:53.560
So what he is going to do next
is to put on the y-axis here

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.940
not the reduction in malaria
cases, but how much these

00:16:56.940 --> 00:17:01.630
people make as adult, how much
a child born after the

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:04.290
campaign makes relative
to a child

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.330
born before the campaign.

00:17:05.330 --> 00:17:08.424
What is this difference in
income between this, and is

00:17:08.424 --> 00:17:13.500
the difference in income
related to the

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.230
malaria at the beginning.

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:18.660
This is called a difference in
difference, because you're

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:21.869
looking at whether the
difference in earning between

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:26.339
a young and an old cohort is
different in places that start

00:17:26.339 --> 00:17:28.500
from a higher level.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:31.060
What you are assuming when
you're doing that is that

00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:33.780
there are no other factors that
are changing exactly at

00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:36.650
the same time in the same way,
and we're going to see what we

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:39.330
can say about that.

00:17:39.330 --> 00:17:43.500
Here is this graph that I was
talking about for Brazil now.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.480
This is the pre-campaign
malaria intensity.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.920
Don't worry about the axis.

00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:52.530
It's sort of standardized at
zero, so for zero being the

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:53.790
median case.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:59.030
And this is the income change of
those born in 1960, that is

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.530
those who were born after the
campaign, minus those who were

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:03.626
born in 1953.

00:18:03.626 --> 00:18:05.680
It is their income later.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.720
We measure the income much
later, in 1980, for example.

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:13.980
So in 1980, we measure the
income of those born in 1960

00:18:13.980 --> 00:18:17.620
minus the income of
those in 1953.

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.050
This is all in log, so it's log
income in 1960 minus log

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:24.060
income in 1953.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.700
And what we see is exactly
what we would expect if

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:30.670
malaria does make you poor,
which is the people who were

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:34.930
born in places like Mato Grosso
here where malaria had

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.300
been a huge deal beforehand, the
young people experience a

00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.580
bigger increase in earnings
relative to the old people

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:46.240
than people, say, in Bahia where
malaria was not a big

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.810
deal to start with.

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:49.060
Do you understand this graph?

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:56.190
So I'm arguing that nothing
else changed between this

00:18:56.190 --> 00:19:00.340
cohort in a way that's related
with malaria intensity, and

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:01.750
what could you argue
back to me?

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.757
What is the worry with
that assumption?

00:19:10.757 --> 00:19:14.499
AUDIENCE: There might be a lot
of other factors that have

00:19:14.499 --> 00:19:16.246
changed over time.

00:19:16.246 --> 00:19:22.234
I mean, if you're born in the
'60s, then [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:31.096 --> 00:19:33.606
PROFESSOR: Yes. so the worry
is something else

00:19:33.606 --> 00:19:34.836
might happen over time.

00:19:34.836 --> 00:19:38.280
AUDIENCE: I was going to say,
sort of similarly that there's

00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.232
probably a third, external
factor that's both raising

00:19:41.232 --> 00:19:43.692
income and decreasing malaria
at the same time.

00:19:43.692 --> 00:19:46.152
Since they have the same
effects, it's not necessarily

00:19:46.152 --> 00:19:47.628
that they're affecting
one another.

00:19:47.628 --> 00:19:49.550
There's a third thing that's
affecting both of them.

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:50.030
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:19:50.030 --> 00:19:52.480
So it could be something
affecting both of them, so

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.510
Brazil is just becoming
generally richer over time.

00:19:55.510 --> 00:19:59.470
But this should be something
that is affecting

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:03.370
disproportionally Mato Grosso
than Bahia, right?

00:20:03.370 --> 00:20:07.220
Because here, I'm not only
telling you that income

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.960
increases between these
two cohorts.

00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.100
I'm also telling you that
increases faster in the region

00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:15.520
that had more malaria
to start with.

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:18.870
But you could ask me, for
example, is it the case that

00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:21.520
this place was poorer in the
beginning, so they had more

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.960
places to go?

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.780
As Brazil was becoming richer,
the poorer regions were

00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:28.350
catching up with the older
regions, and this is what I

00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:30.670
see here, just to catch up.

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:31.740
So that could be.

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.450
It's kind of one twist to the
point that both of you made,

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:38.100
which is as Brazil was growing,
maybe it is possible

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:41.330
that this region would have
been growing more anyway.

00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.960
Now of course, I'm looking at
the income in 1980s, but these

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:48.130
are different cohorts, so maybe
the same places that had

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.140
a lot of malaria had
people who were

00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.890
not very well educated.

00:20:51.890 --> 00:20:54.250
And at the same times that I
took care of malaria, I also

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:57.177
built a lot of schools for them,
and I'm seeing these

00:20:57.177 --> 00:21:01.150
guys are income increased
relative to the older ones.

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.820
It's just because I also
built a lot of

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:03.850
schools in Mato Grosso.

00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.680
So that would be your third
factor that would be

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:08.200
differentially important
in the region.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.870
So that is obviously
a real concern.

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:14.520
By looking at changes in income
over the importance of

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.370
malaria at the beginning, we've
gone one step towards

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.780
some credibility.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.310
We're still very far from our
randomized trial, which would

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:25.530
involve randomly treating some
people for malaria, waiting 20

00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.900
years, and seeing how much more
money they make like they

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:29.490
did with the deworming.

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:33.460
Such that it doesn't exist, so
we need to try to do the best

00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.120
with what we have.

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:41.200
One way to verify this is that
we actually know exactly when

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.160
people start getting treated
for malaria, because the

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:50.620
campaign, if you go back to this
graph, was quite sudden.

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:53.880
In fact, we know the date at
which they started spraying,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:58.540
and so we should have a pretty
clear idea of which cohort get

00:21:58.540 --> 00:22:02.090
exposed and which cohort
are not exposed.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:06.930
So instead of doing this kind
of graph for a broad cohort

00:22:06.930 --> 00:22:11.080
and looking at the slope here, I
could say, well, let me do a

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:14.730
test, for example, if I did the
same graph for those born

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.990
in 1953 versus those
born in 1950.

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:26.050
If this graph was due to the
decline of malaria, what would

00:22:26.050 --> 00:22:30.180
I expect if I, instead of doing
these differences, I did

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:34.120
1953 minus 1950?

00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:37.580
What should I expect for my line
if the only reason why I

00:22:37.580 --> 00:22:40.240
have an increasing line
here is due to the

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.560
reduction in malaria?

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.946
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:44.946 --> 00:22:46.310
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:48.870
I should expect a flat
line, exactly.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.370
Because the 1953 kids I
exposed to malaria.

00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:54.130
So are the 1950.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:57.270
So the differences between their
income should not be

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:58.810
related to how much
malaria there is

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:00.345
because no one benefited.

00:23:00.345 --> 00:23:08.070
Now if instead I'm taking kids
who were born in 1950, so in

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:13.090
1970, and I'm comparing them
to the wages of kid born in

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:19.760
1965, what should I expect
for this line?

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:22.390
Now I'm looking at very
young kids, kids born

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:36.170
in 1970 versus 1965.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:38.454
So we can go back to
this graph here.

00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:46.450
What's the pattern in malaria
cases after the 1970?

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:47.665
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:47.665 --> 00:23:49.865
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there is no
further decline because there

00:23:49.865 --> 00:23:50.330
is no malaria left.

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:52.410
AUDIENCE: It should be
flat as well, right?

00:23:52.410 --> 00:23:52.920
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.030
It should be flat as well, not
because everybody has malaria,

00:23:56.030 --> 00:23:58.370
but because no one
has malaria.

00:23:58.370 --> 00:24:02.250
So with malaria, we have a
pretty specific pattern as to

00:24:02.250 --> 00:24:04.260
when I should start
seeing an effect.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:07.460
If I'm thinking that the big
problem of malaria is when you

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:10.190
are very small kids, then
I should start seeing a

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:16.340
difference between the children
who were born just

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:20.470
before and just after
the campaign.

00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:22.720
During that time of the campaign
scale up, I should

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.225
this effect being the larger and
larger, but for the young

00:24:26.225 --> 00:24:29.540
cohort, it should flatten out if
I compare very young cohort

00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.650
to somewhat younger cohort but
all of them got exposed.

00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:35.400
And for the old cohort, it
should again flatten out,

00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.320
because the old cohort has
not yet been exposed.

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:41.700
So I can now say something
more specific than why

00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:45.740
generally the very youngest
versus the young are the

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.020
difference increase in
pre-malaria intensity, which

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.770
could well be correlated
with other things

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:52.720
happening at the same time.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.960
He's doing that, so let me
guide you to this graph.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.190
What is this graph?

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.030
It has the shape that I talked
to you about, right?

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.490
It has the shape of being flat,
and then increasing, and

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:05.190
then being flat again.

00:25:05.190 --> 00:25:07.470
So what is this graph?

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:13.010
Each of these points is the
slope of a regression of this

00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:20.640
kind, except that instead of
being 1960 versus 1953, it is

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.960
one year versus the other.

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:36.810
For example, this is everyone
relative to the oldest cohort.

00:25:36.810 --> 00:25:39.540
Each dot indicates the strength
of the relationship

00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.530
between pre-malaria index
and the index for

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:45.320
these particular cohorts.

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:53.150
So for example, 1900 versus
1910, 1911, 1912, et cetera.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:55.830
I'm taking the difference
between the income of the

00:25:55.830 --> 00:26:02.900
cohort born, say, 1910 minus
1900, and I'm plotting this

00:26:02.900 --> 00:26:06.100
graph that is here
as a function of

00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:09.490
the pre-malaria intensity.

00:26:09.490 --> 00:26:15.700
So each of these points here is
a slope of a graph that is

00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:22.230
this graph with instead of 1960
minus 1953 is, say, 1901

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:28.930
versus 1900, 1902 versus 1900,
1903 versus 1900, et cetera.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:35.580
And this is plotted as a
function of the 1901, 1902,

00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:37.770
1903, et cetera, the
cohort of both.

00:26:37.770 --> 00:26:42.850
So all of these cohorts were
cohorts that were not exposed,

00:26:42.850 --> 00:26:50.640
and we basically we see
not much of a line.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:55.420
This line is superimposed, but
if you see this cloud of dots,

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:57.940
the cloud of dots is
not increasing.

00:26:57.940 --> 00:27:01.510
So the difference is not
related to the malaria

00:27:01.510 --> 00:27:03.250
intensity in those places.

00:27:03.250 --> 00:27:06.530
Those places are generally poor,
but it's not correlated

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.340
with the malaria intensity.

00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.090
For the younger cohort, we see
the slope keeps increasing.

00:27:13.090 --> 00:27:14.890
The slope keeps increasing,
keep increasing, keeps

00:27:14.890 --> 00:27:18.370
increasing until there is
basically no difference

00:27:18.370 --> 00:27:23.275
between a region that initially
had a lot of malaria

00:27:23.275 --> 00:27:26.500
and a region that didn't have a
lot of malaria, and then it

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:28.420
flattens again.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:35.190
So these are the patterns that
we were expecting to see where

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:38.220
between the old cohort and the
slightly less old cohort we

00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.760
see no difference until they
get exposed to the malaria,

00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.290
and then it increases, and
then it flattens again.

00:27:45.290 --> 00:27:49.650
So you could do still have the
type of factors that you get

00:27:49.650 --> 00:27:51.590
we were talking about, that
maybe they were building

00:27:51.590 --> 00:27:54.260
schools exactly at the
same time, et cetera.

00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:57.250
But it would have to be relative
tricky to follow

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:03.370
exactly that pattern where this
is the pattern of the

00:28:03.370 --> 00:28:07.080
malaria campaign going and going
and going, and we have

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.920
the points pretty much following
the expansion of the

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.140
malaria campaign.

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.890
This is not complete.

00:28:14.890 --> 00:28:16.550
You still have to believe
that this is the

00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:18.300
only thing that happens.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:20.840
But it gives you a pretty good
sense that it must have been

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.430
the only thing that really
happened for this, because

00:28:23.430 --> 00:28:26.130
otherwise why would
it have this

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.490
bizarre-looking snake shape?

00:28:31.450 --> 00:28:34.630
Are you all OK with
this graph?

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:39.040
And do find it reasonably
convincing?

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:41.080
Yes, no?

00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:42.304
No vote.

00:28:42.304 --> 00:28:44.400
I find it reasonably convincing,
and I'm in the

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.400
business of doing [INAUDIBLE],
so I'm very skeptical of

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.780
anything that might be a
substitute to what I do.

00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.760
But it's hard to imagine another
factor that would

00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.480
follow so nicely the pattern
of the campaign.

00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.010
What he does, then, is to run a
regression which is based on

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.360
this idea, and he concludes
that a child exposed to

00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:12.770
malaria in childhood would
have an income that's 50%

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:17.530
lower than a child who had not
been exposed in childhood over

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:18.150
their lifetime.

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.630
So it's even better than
deworming, which is not

00:29:20.630 --> 00:29:22.110
surprising because
malaria makes you

00:29:22.110 --> 00:29:23.650
sicker than the worms.

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:29.140
But this is a very large effect,
so it's high, but it's

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.030
not absurdly high.

00:29:30.030 --> 00:29:33.620
If you consider that deworming
is 23%, we are still in kind

00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:35.760
of the ballpark of where
it makes sense.

00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:39.680
So it suggests that childhood
malaria actually makes you

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.740
weak for the rest of your
life, and again we could

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:45.070
calculate what it means
for the lifetime of

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:46.720
someone, of an income.

00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:51.700
So if an increase of 23% of
income with deworming make you

00:29:51.700 --> 00:29:56.570
about, I think we had found,
$1,100 richer or $1,300

00:29:56.570 --> 00:30:00.060
richer, this is about twice
that over your lifetime.

00:30:00.060 --> 00:30:03.130
So if these effects are the same
in Kenya, it would mean

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:06.230
that avoiding malaria in
childhood would make you

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:10.970
$2,600 richer for
your lifetime.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:16.020
Which brings the question that
Zachary has asked at the end

00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.750
of the deworming lecture, which
is if that's so great,

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:21.970
why aren't people
are doing it?

00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.250
So the question here becomes why
aren't countries doing it,

00:30:25.250 --> 00:30:27.740
and why are people
not doing it?

00:30:27.740 --> 00:30:31.390
So why aren't countries all
doing things like Latin

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:34.670
America did of intensive
campaign to try and get rid of

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:37.450
the affliction, so public
health kind of measure?

00:30:37.450 --> 00:30:39.600
And if they're not going to do
it because they all have

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:42.570
difference or because there
is political, economic

00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.360
consideration that prevents
DDT from being used or

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.880
anything like that, then why
aren't people at least buying

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:53.130
a bed net which costs $7 or
maybe $10 for a family?

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.950
It would mean the child would
have a pretty good chance of

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:59.580
being substantially richer
over the lifetime.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.600
So that's kind of the mystery.

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.610
One thing just to close the loop
on Sachs is now that you

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:11.350
have this estimate, you can
calculate what is malaria

00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.480
prevalence, in the countries
that have a lot of malaria,

00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.340
how much more these people would
make if they didn't have

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:20.450
malaria and obtain a number that
is comparable to the 30%

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:23.280
differences that is in the
Sachs and Gallup article.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.290
And what you find is a number
that is much, much smaller.

00:31:26.290 --> 00:31:30.070
So you find that Sachs and
Gallup completely overestimate

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:34.410
the impact of malaria on GDP
even though the impact on

00:31:34.410 --> 00:31:37.000
income is still positive and
still quite serious.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.220
So you do find it's not 30%.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:42.850
I don't want to give you the
number and then it happens not

00:31:42.850 --> 00:31:44.270
to be the right one,
but the order of

00:31:44.270 --> 00:31:46.070
magnitude is maybe a fourth.

00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:49.170
But it's still pretty
significant and important.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:53.850
So that gives us this idea of
why aren't countries spraying

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:57.550
and why aren't people
buying bed nets?

00:31:57.550 --> 00:32:01.240
This question we could ask over
and over and over again.

00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:06.410
I haven't seen a cross benefit
analysis of not getting

00:32:06.410 --> 00:32:11.320
diarrhea all the time when
you're a child, but presumably

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:14.600
that's something probably
similar to the deworming

00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.800
effect because worms are little
bit equivalent of

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.680
diarrhea in terms of getting
rid of your nutrition.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.915
So why aren't people putting
bleach in their water?

00:32:25.915 --> 00:32:31.800
Why aren't people buying
[INAUDIBLE] when they're sick,

00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:32.820
and things like that.

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:37.700
So this is the mystery
we have to ask.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.850
What we have already seen in the
previous lecture, and also

00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:44.160
a little bit with nutrition,
us that preventive care is

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.010
characterized by two things.

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:53.110
One is it is very low demand,
and the second is it is a high

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:55.970
sensitivity to prices.

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.330
Let me show a graph.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:02.610
This is the highest sensitivity
to positive

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:05.930
prices, and I'm going to show
you in a moment the high

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:10.180
sensitivity to negative prices,
which are incentives.

00:33:10.180 --> 00:33:12.700
You've already seen some
of these numbers.

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:20.620
You've already seen the red
dots, which are coming from

00:33:20.620 --> 00:33:23.200
the Dupas experiment in Kenya,
so this is this one.

00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:29.760
This is the graph for bed nets,
so when bed nets are

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.760
free, you pretty much get them,
but when you need to pay

00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:40.150
for them, a little bit of money
like $0.60, you're less

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:43.106
likely to get and use
them, et cetera.

00:33:46.204 --> 00:33:49.790
What is interesting is that we
find the same kind of slope,

00:33:49.790 --> 00:33:54.800
even steeper, for other goods
that are completely different.

00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:58.390
So you find the same kind of
slope for clothing in Zambia

00:33:58.390 --> 00:34:02.010
where if you ask people to pay
a little bit for clothing,

00:34:02.010 --> 00:34:03.540
they're much less likely
to get to it.

00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:08.620
So when they start to have to
pay $0.10, $0.20, $0.30, the

00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:11.630
take up reduces a lot.

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:15.820
You're finding the same thing
for deworming in Kenya.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.960
We actually briefly evoked
this when we were talking

00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:24.350
about deworming when we saw
that people in the school

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:27.380
where they did the experiment,
at some point the NGO who was

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:34.500
in this sustainability kind of
mood, I guess, decided it

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.120
makes sense to ask
people to pay a

00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:39.250
little bit do for deworming.

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:42.690
So they asked people to pay a
little bit, and basically what

00:34:42.690 --> 00:34:46.469
happened is that the take up
went essentially to zero.

00:34:46.469 --> 00:34:48.600
Let me try and get
the right point.

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.730
I think this is this one.

00:34:50.730 --> 00:34:53.860
The take up went essentially to
zero when people had to pay

00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.010
just a little bit
for deworming.

00:34:56.010 --> 00:34:57.320
So you're looking at bed nets.

00:34:57.320 --> 00:34:58.420
You're looking at clothing.

00:34:58.420 --> 00:35:01.250
You're looking at deworming.

00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.900
They're all very different
products presumably with very

00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:06.560
different life time benefit, and
they pretty much all seem

00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.900
to be on the same slope, which
is as soon as people have to

00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:12.590
pay just a little bit, they
don't do it anymore.

00:35:12.590 --> 00:35:13.890
So that's on the
negative price.

00:35:13.890 --> 00:35:14.330
Yeah?

00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:16.214
AUDIENCE: Are some lines steeper
because people don't

00:35:16.214 --> 00:35:20.086
see the value as much in paying
for the other things

00:35:20.086 --> 00:35:20.570
[INAUDIBLE]

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.870
PROFESSOR: So what is
interesting is that except for

00:35:22.870 --> 00:35:25.390
this one, all of the lines
are pretty steep.

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:31.860
So the question that we have
to ask here is why is that?

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.150
And one possible reason would
clearly be that people don't

00:35:35.150 --> 00:35:35.620
see the value.

00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:38.140
I'm going to get to
that in a moment.

00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:41.390
Before we go to that, let's
see the elasticity with

00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:45.170
respect to negative price, which
are small incentives.

00:35:45.170 --> 00:35:50.250
So one thing that you already
noticed is that the rate of

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:53.230
immunization is very, very
low in some places.

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:54.870
It's higher in some others.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.510
This is [INAUDIBLE], the places

00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:58.630
where you saw the movie.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:01.900
After the movie was finished,
one thing we noticed is that a

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:05.170
big problem seems to be that
kids are not immunized.

00:36:05.170 --> 00:36:07.150
The immunization rate
was very, very, very

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.660
low, less than 5%.

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.620
So we decided the
try two things.

00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:15.920
The first thing was that the
NGOs [INAUDIBLE] would work

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:20.470
with the government to do a
monthly camp for immunization.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:23.080
So every month, they would take
the vaccines from the

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:26.370
government, go to the village,
and immunize whoever wanted to

00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:28.200
come to be immunized.

00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:33.200
And on top of this,
[INAUDIBLE]

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:36.120
also instituted a small
incentive to get immunized, so

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:39.190
that's a kilo of lentil.

00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:42.180
Lentil is a [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:47.280
It's something people eat as a
source of protein, and a kilo

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:50.960
of lentil is about half
the minimum wage.

00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:55.350
So this is a small, small
gift to go with it.

00:36:55.350 --> 00:36:57.280
It's not like a large inducement
that if it's

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.730
something you don't want
to do it would

00:36:58.730 --> 00:37:00.570
convince you to do it.

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:03.220
And these were the results.

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:05.470
There was also a set of control
villages that I'm not

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:06.190
showing to you.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:08.560
I'm just showing to you the
effect of the incentive.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:17.790
So comparing the camp
without incentive to

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.350
the camp with incentive.

00:37:20.350 --> 00:37:24.710
Intervention B are the villages
where the lentils

00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:28.310
were put in place, and you can
see that pretty much everyone

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:30.170
gets the first shot.

00:37:30.170 --> 00:37:32.310
That's BCG.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:35.930
And the second shot is
also pretty similar.

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:38.720
From the third, we start seeing
a difference, and from

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:41.370
the fourth, an even bigger
difference, and from the

00:37:41.370 --> 00:37:44.010
fifth, the biggest difference.

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:49.810
The biggest difference is
between the more immunization

00:37:49.810 --> 00:37:53.500
you need to get, the more the
small incentive matter.

00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.580
So it seems that people are
not adverse to getting

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.320
immunized, but they sort of
lose interest or something

00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:01.740
such that the more you get into
trying to get them to

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:07.350
complete the course, the more
the incentive is needed.

00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:09.710
And this is a reasonably
large effect.

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:13.380
Overall if you look at the
effect on immunization, about

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:19.320
12% of kids who are in one
intervention received all the

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:25.400
immunization they should get, so
18% versus 38% if they get

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:26.650
the incentive.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:35.490
We have three things that we
need to try and square.

00:38:35.490 --> 00:38:39.530
One is the benefits are very
high, two is the demand is

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:43.900
very low, And three is the price
elasticity is very high,

00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.300
both from the positive side
and the negative side.

00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.360
And the question is, how
do we put all of

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:51.540
these elements together?

00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:54.770
And the reason it is surprising
is that suppose we

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:58.950
take as given that the benefits
are indeed very high.

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:05.000
In that case, if people knew
it, if people don't do

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:07.740
something, it must mean that
they think that the cost is

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.520
also very high.

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.550
Why would they think the
cost is very high?

00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:13.380
Maybe they think it's not
culturally appropriate.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:17.830
Maybe they hate to get
their kids immunized.

00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:20.550
Maybe sleeping under the bad
nets is extremely unpleasant,

00:39:20.550 --> 00:39:23.340
or maybe they need the
money so much.

00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:27.040
So if people are very sensitive
to the benefits, are

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.650
very aware of the benefits,
the only reason why they

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:32.730
wouldn't do it is because they
think the costs are huge.

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:37.280
For example, another fact that
we see both in rich and poor

00:39:37.280 --> 00:39:43.040
countries, people are not very
likely to get a test for HIV

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.380
even and maybe particularly if
they have put themselves at

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:47.960
risk of HIV.

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.380
And one of the reasons that
people say is that people

00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:53.550
realize that it would be good to
know your status, but they

00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:55.320
are worried.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.940
There is a fear of what will
you do if you find out that

00:39:57.940 --> 00:39:58.790
you're positive.

00:39:58.790 --> 00:40:03.520
Or there is also the social
factor of people knowing that

00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:08.600
if you go to get tested, it
means you've done something

00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:11.660
not right, otherwise why would
you have HIV if you are only

00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:14.890
faithful to your husband
who is faithful to you?

00:40:14.890 --> 00:40:18.010
So this is an example where
the benefits are high and

00:40:18.010 --> 00:40:21.150
maybe the costs are also high.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:23.960
But what is surprising is that
if people don't do these

00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:27.560
things because the costs are
high, then I should not able

00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:30.780
to bribe them to do these things
with a small incentive

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:33.040
like the kilo of lentil.

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:36.020
If people know the benefits of
immunization but don't do it

00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:38.270
because they think that the evil
eye is going to be on the

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:41.780
kid, then a kilo of lentils
shouldn't convince them that,

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.845
no, the evil eye is going
to be good after all.

00:40:43.845 --> 00:40:47.020
It's something that just doesn't
square together.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:50.780
Or if people were so much aware
of the benefit, they

00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:54.030
shouldn't take a bed net when
it's free but refuse to spend

00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:55.920
a few cents for it.

00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.740
So we can't have these three
things be true at the same

00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:05.210
time, that people realize that
the benefits are very high,

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.850
the demand is very low,
and the price

00:41:06.850 --> 00:41:09.030
elasticity is very high.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.940
So it has to be that the
benefits viewed from the

00:41:12.940 --> 00:41:16.130
people is actually not as high
as we think they are.

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:20.240
And there could be three
reasons for that.

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.975
One is that maybe people don't
care about their health or

00:41:22.975 --> 00:41:26.025
don't care about the health of
their children, and that we

00:41:26.025 --> 00:41:29.460
already sort of ruled out
because we've seen in the

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.690
movie that people are extremely
concerned about

00:41:31.690 --> 00:41:32.240
their health.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:34.460
They spend a lot
of money on it.

00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.640
For example, they spend
7% of their

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:38.950
monthly budget on health.

00:41:38.950 --> 00:41:42.050
That's a lot, and that is
something that we've seen in

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:43.510
the first lecture.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:49.570
People do spend up to 5% to 7%
of their budget on health, the

00:41:49.570 --> 00:41:52.480
very poor, except in countries
like Mexico where there's a

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.440
good public health system.

00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.650
So it is not that people don't
care about health.

00:41:57.650 --> 00:42:00.470
We have seen the example
of measles.

00:42:00.470 --> 00:42:02.950
They don't vaccinate their kids
against measles, but if

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:05.100
the kids do get measles, they
spend a lot of money on the

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:07.530
hospital and on treatment.

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:10.440
So that's not because they
don't care about health.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.690
Also when you ask them about
what stresses them out, they

00:42:15.690 --> 00:42:18.530
tend to say that health is the
one thing that stresses them

00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:19.640
out the most.

00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:22.770
What makes them worried, tense
and anxious in the last month

00:42:22.770 --> 00:42:26.040
is their health, or the health
of their kids, or the health

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.010
of their relatives.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.390
So people do care about their
health, and they spend money,

00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:32.010
but they don't spend it
on curative care.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.560
They do spend it on directive
care, not preventive.

00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.180
And they not only spend it
on curative care, but

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.200
on pretty bad ones.

00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.960
We've seen these shots
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.880
and stuff like that.

00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:43.680
So we can remove this.

00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.650
So now why do people don't
use preventive care?

00:42:46.650 --> 00:42:48.670
It's not because they don't care
about health, but it's

00:42:48.670 --> 00:42:51.900
because there's something about
preventive care, that

00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:56.100
either they don't really believe
that it works or

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:58.480
there's something else, that the
perception of the benefits

00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.422
from today is relatively low.

00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:04.880
Are government to
blame for that?

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.680
Another possible interpretation
is that people

00:43:07.680 --> 00:43:11.790
are not getting those services
because they are

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:12.920
not generally available.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:16.410
People don't even know
that they exist.

00:43:16.410 --> 00:43:21.160
And we've seen in the movie that
to a certain extent, we

00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:24.950
have reasons to blame
the governments.

00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:28.160
Nurses are often absent, not
only in India, but everywhere.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.450
There was a World Bank survey
conducted in several

00:43:31.450 --> 00:43:34.520
countries, going to the little
hospitals where the nurses

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:37.880
are, found 35% of them absent.

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.620
And even when they're there,
they don't really spend a lot

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.370
of time on people, they don't
treat them very well.

00:43:43.370 --> 00:43:50.340
There is this interesting 3-3-3
rule that Jishnu Das and

00:43:50.340 --> 00:43:52.990
Jeff Hammer found in India.

00:43:52.990 --> 00:43:57.000
That's three minutes, three
questions, three drugs.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.780
That's what you get when you go
to see a doctor in a public

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.370
health facility.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:03.830
They interviewed
three minutes.

00:44:03.830 --> 00:44:05.380
They ask three questions.

00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:06.726
They usually don't touch you.

00:44:06.726 --> 00:44:09.540
They ask you what do you have?

00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.210
And then they give you
three medicines

00:44:11.210 --> 00:44:12.840
that you go away with.

00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:15.740
So that's not excellent care.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:21.950
And the government doctors
usually know more than the

00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:24.475
private doctors who are
not really qualified.

00:44:24.475 --> 00:44:26.160
They're all much
more qualified.

00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:31.040
If you ask them to rank
vignettes, so you show them a

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:36.110
scenario of a child comes to the
clinic with diarrhea, and

00:44:36.110 --> 00:44:40.780
you ask the right question to
evaluate what is this kid

00:44:40.780 --> 00:44:44.440
suffering from, what should I
do, the public doctors do much

00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.970
better than the private doctors
on those tests.

00:44:47.970 --> 00:44:50.360
For example, when a pregnant
woman arrives with

00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:52.700
preeclampsia, which is a
potentially fatal condition

00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:56.890
that happens during pregnancy,
they are much more likely to

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:59.335
diagnose at its start and to say
that the right course of

00:44:59.335 --> 00:45:00.960
action is to send them
to hospital.

00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:03.710
So in principle, they know more,
the public doctors, but

00:45:03.710 --> 00:45:06.300
in practice, they
do much less.

00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:08.210
So even though they know what
they are supposed to do, when

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:11.460
you actually look at what they
do by putting someone to

00:45:11.460 --> 00:45:14.400
observe their behavior, you
realize that they don't really

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.990
use their knowledge.

00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:20.990
So that's a part
of the problem.

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:23.210
The nurses are not here, they
are desultory, they don't

00:45:23.210 --> 00:45:26.050
really care, but it's not
the entire problem.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:31.010
Because if you go back to the
immunization experiment that I

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:34.520
just showed you where the first
treatment was to have

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.050
perfect immunization camps--

00:45:37.050 --> 00:45:40.510
every month, in your own
village, with a paraworker

00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:43.570
that used to go to people and
try to remind them that the

00:45:43.570 --> 00:45:48.240
camp is coming, and you should
bring your kids, and the

00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:55.850
nurses who were vaccinating the
kids were good, caring, et

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:56.600
cetera people--

00:45:56.600 --> 00:46:01.430
even when you do all that, only
18% of people or 12% of

00:46:01.430 --> 00:46:03.540
people got immunized.

00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:04.890
I think that's actually 18.

00:46:04.890 --> 00:46:06.500
It's 6 plus 12.

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:10.140
18% of people got immunized.

00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:13.550
So the bad services by the
government doctor is not the

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:15.590
only thing that there is to
blame, because even when you

00:46:15.590 --> 00:46:18.940
provide good services,
you still don't get

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:21.480
a lot of them in.

00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:22.980
So supply is not the
only reason.

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:27.380
Governments are not
only to blame.

00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.410
What are we left with?

00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.960
People don't demand preventive
care not because they don't

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.460
care about health.

00:46:34.460 --> 00:46:37.380
Not because it's just not
available, because they don't

00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.750
demand it even when
it's available.

00:46:40.750 --> 00:46:44.540
So we are left with two
possible explanations.

00:46:44.540 --> 00:46:49.940
One is that they understand the
benefits, but the benefits

00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:52.880
are far away in the future,
and they discount those

00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:55.810
benefits that are far away
in the future a lot.

00:46:55.810 --> 00:46:59.870
And the second is that they
don't know the effectiveness

00:46:59.870 --> 00:47:03.730
of preventive care just because
it's very difficult to

00:47:03.730 --> 00:47:05.705
understand what works,
and why it works, and

00:47:05.705 --> 00:47:07.222
why it doesn't work.

00:47:07.222 --> 00:47:10.010
AUDIENCE: So in India we saw
that part of the reason is

00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:13.530
also because they believed
in religious cures more.

00:47:13.530 --> 00:47:15.855
Is that true in other countries
in the developing

00:47:15.855 --> 00:47:16.602
world as well?

00:47:16.602 --> 00:47:18.096
Is that predominantly
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:18.096 --> 00:47:20.110
PROFESSOR: No, I think it's true
in general that people

00:47:20.110 --> 00:47:22.140
construct all sorts of
interesting beliefs.

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:25.580
What is important is that
you have those beliefs.

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:27.760
On the other hand, if I give you
a kilo of lentils, those

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:31.640
beliefs are not strong enough
for you not to sell them for a

00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:32.680
kilo of lentils.

00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:35.700
So I think what is really
important is that it's not

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:39.035
that people think that
immunization is something bad,

00:47:39.035 --> 00:47:41.610
because otherwise it would be
very hard to convince them

00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:43.000
with small things.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.600
It has to be that they just
don't think much about it one

00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.720
way or the other.

00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.496
AUDIENCE: I was wondering
is there an example of a

00:47:53.496 --> 00:47:55.725
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:55.725 --> 00:47:58.870
if people are embarrassed
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:01.750
assume something that
they [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:05.110 --> 00:48:06.070
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:48:06.070 --> 00:48:08.090
That is a very interesting
question.

00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:16.910
For example, you could say if
you have a cultural reason not

00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.690
to do something, if you have
this social reason that you

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.740
are embarrassed, if I give you
a small incentive, you can

00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.390
just say, oh, I've gone for
this small incentive.

00:48:25.390 --> 00:48:27.620
And in fact, there was a very
interesting study that was

00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.280
done which was trying to
shed some light on

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.090
exactly this issue.

00:48:32.090 --> 00:48:36.520
It's a study where as part of a
survey, everyone got tested

00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:39.500
for HIV, everyone who agreed.

00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.710
But you didn't need to
get your results.

00:48:41.710 --> 00:48:44.730
If you wanted your result, you
had to go pick them up three

00:48:44.730 --> 00:48:48.880
weeks later at camp.

00:48:48.880 --> 00:48:54.600
And so, at the end, people
[INAUDIBLE] a bottle cap where

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:59.610
they got a reward for picking
up their tests.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:03.060
It could go from zero to
something like $1 in small

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.330
increments.

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.680
And in addition, the researcher
also randomized

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:12.230
where they put the tent where
you would get your results.

00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:14.740
In some cases, it was put right
in the middle of the

00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:20.610
village, so very convenient, but
very visible so everybody

00:49:20.610 --> 00:49:22.500
would know that you're
going there.

00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.340
In some places, it was put--
because it was random, so it

00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:28.000
was like throwing a dart on the
village and saying we are

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.970
going to put it there-- it was
like in the middle of a field.

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:34.510
So a little bit far away, not
very convenient, but much more

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:37.870
discrete because no one would
see you go there.

00:49:37.870 --> 00:49:41.230
And what they found is that,
number one, people were

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:46.980
extremely sensitive to the
reward, suggesting that it is

00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:50.420
not some deep psychological
fear that were making them

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:53.770
worried to pick up their test,
because whatever this fear was

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:56.310
could be overcome by $0.10.

00:49:56.310 --> 00:49:58.750
Now it could still be
the social thing.

00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:03.280
So here, what do you think
they found with the tent?

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.530
Do you think more people got
their result when it was far

00:50:06.530 --> 00:50:09.520
away or when it was close by?

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.610
First, what would we expect
under both, and what would we

00:50:12.610 --> 00:50:16.722
expect under the social
stigma story?

00:50:16.722 --> 00:50:19.082
AUDIENCE: The far away tent--

00:50:19.082 --> 00:50:20.380
PROFESSOR: That the far
away tent would

00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:21.442
have been more popular.

00:50:21.442 --> 00:50:24.350
But in fact what they found is
the exact opposite, that the

00:50:24.350 --> 00:50:25.990
far away tent was not
popular at all.

00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:28.270
Nobody wanted to walk more
than a kilometer

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:29.390
to get their test.

00:50:29.390 --> 00:50:33.080
And the close by tent
was very popular.

00:50:33.080 --> 00:50:43.050
And furthermore, they also found
that the elasticity with

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:47.200
respect to this tent was much
smaller when there was a gift.

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.550
So when there was a gift, people
did walk a kilometer to

00:50:49.550 --> 00:50:56.260
get their results, but when
there was no gift, people were

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.550
very sensitive to
the distance.

00:50:58.550 --> 00:51:05.260
So those suggest that in this
case, in Malawi, [INAUDIBLE],

00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.130
neither the social background,
not the psychological barrier,

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:13.050
were so big, and that if people
didn't get their HIV

00:51:13.050 --> 00:51:17.000
result, it was more due to some
form of procrastination

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.490
or inertia or something
like that.

00:51:19.490 --> 00:51:23.420
And that is something a little
bit surprising because

00:51:23.420 --> 00:51:26.610
anti-retrovirals are available
in Malawi, so in principal if

00:51:26.610 --> 00:51:29.440
you find that you're positive,
you can do something.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:34.600
And if you find out that you're
negative, then you can

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:38.542
try and take some steps
to remain that way.

00:51:38.542 --> 00:51:43.100
AUDIENCE: Is it possible they
just value [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.980
PROFESSOR: So in this case, it
shows that-- so in the case of

00:51:45.980 --> 00:51:48.380
the HIV, [INAUDIBLE]
all this money.

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.280
Exactly what this means is that
it has to be that they

00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:56.100
value the small gains more than
the results of the exam.

00:51:56.100 --> 00:51:58.120
And this is what is surprising,
which is you have

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.780
to say why is that the case when
it is something that it

00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:03.230
should be so helpful to
you to know whether

00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:04.620
or not you're positive?

00:52:04.620 --> 00:52:07.650
Or with the lentils, it should
be so helpful to you that your

00:52:07.650 --> 00:52:08.782
kid is immunized.

00:52:08.782 --> 00:52:11.334
AUDIENCE: Can I ask a
followup question?

00:52:11.334 --> 00:52:17.298
Does that mean that we should
reevaluate how we [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:17.298 --> 00:52:23.759
so you're saying HIV tests
could potentially be more

00:52:23.759 --> 00:52:25.747
helpful because they could
be cured [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:29.226 --> 00:52:32.208
Shouldn't we be assigning more
weight to [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:40.190
PROFESSOR: What we have seen
is it doesn't mean that we

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:43.790
should put more weight on
instant gratification things

00:52:43.790 --> 00:52:45.050
than we do.

00:52:45.050 --> 00:52:47.630
What this means, in my view, is
that we should understand

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:51.630
why there is this disconnect
between what doctors know, for

00:52:51.630 --> 00:52:54.110
example, and what people feel.

00:52:54.110 --> 00:52:55.930
Because that's kind of the
source of the mystery, that

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:58.950
there is this big tension, and
it has to be about the

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:00.990
perception of the benefits.

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:05.340
And one aspect of this is this
future versus present, and one

00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.300
aspect of this is whether
you understand what

00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.295
the benefits are.

00:53:10.295 --> 00:53:12.259
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:12.259 --> 00:53:15.205
HIV testing, I think the
results make sense just

00:53:15.205 --> 00:53:17.169
because if your test
comes out HIV

00:53:17.169 --> 00:53:18.642
negative, well then, great.

00:53:18.642 --> 00:53:20.115
You're just going to go
on with your life.

00:53:20.115 --> 00:53:22.733
And if it comes out positive, is
there really that much you

00:53:22.733 --> 00:53:25.025
can do about it if you're
[INAUDIBLE]--

00:53:25.025 --> 00:53:26.365
I thought those [INAUDIBLE]
were very expensive.

00:53:26.365 --> 00:53:31.050
PROFESSOR: So, in Malawi and
in several other African

00:53:31.050 --> 00:53:35.510
countries, it's actually
available for free.

00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:37.050
So you can do something.

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:43.340
It's not going to cure you,
but it's going to greatly

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:45.500
improve your life for
the time to come.

00:53:45.500 --> 00:53:47.040
People might not fully
realize that.

00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.491
AUDIENCE: I have
two questions.

00:53:49.491 --> 00:53:51.946
[INAUDIBLE] certainty
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:51.946 --> 00:53:54.401
if you're getting [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:54.401 --> 00:53:57.347
a certain cost [INAUDIBLE]

00:53:57.347 --> 00:53:58.329
really uncertain.

00:53:58.329 --> 00:54:02.257
And the second question was
about with the lentil

00:54:02.257 --> 00:54:05.694
distribution, can you play
with short term kind of

00:54:05.694 --> 00:54:06.676
[INAUDIBLE] cost?

00:54:06.676 --> 00:54:10.113
So people can procrastinate
indefinitely to always get a

00:54:10.113 --> 00:54:13.385
pack of lentils when you get a
vaccine, but if you only get

00:54:13.385 --> 00:54:17.195
lentils on the first day of the
month, then wouldn't that

00:54:17.195 --> 00:54:20.202
really lower the cost today
relative to tomorrow?

00:54:20.202 --> 00:54:22.330
PROFESSOR: That's a
very good point.

00:54:22.330 --> 00:54:26.750
Why don't I table the questions
until we give a bit

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:28.000
more context, and
we'll go back to

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.250
exactly these questions.

00:54:31.920 --> 00:54:33.360
They really have two problems.

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:38.470
One is that you might not know
that it's worthwhile getting

00:54:38.470 --> 00:54:41.730
your HIV test because you might
not know that you are

00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:43.800
entitled to the drugs or that
the drugs will really help

00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:48.720
you, or you might not know that
getting immunized is so

00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.310
beneficial.

00:54:50.310 --> 00:54:54.930
And the other is the benefits
are in the future, the cost is

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:56.480
now, and that leads people
to procrastinate.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:02.010
Let's go over both things.

00:55:02.010 --> 00:55:05.010
The first thing is learning
about health care, and we had

00:55:05.010 --> 00:55:08.080
a little bit of that discussion
already last time.

00:55:08.080 --> 00:55:13.540
But most diseases are
self-limiting, that is, they

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.395
just go away by themselves.

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:24.340
You don't know that because
how would you know?

00:55:24.340 --> 00:55:27.850
You start with a theory that
someone has told you that as

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:30.590
soon as you're sick, you should
get a shot to put the

00:55:30.590 --> 00:55:32.180
medicine right into
your blood.

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:35.440
And if you don't do that,
you won't get better.

00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:40.000
And then if the market is
unregulated, like it is in a

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.160
lot of developing countries
where anybody can establish

00:55:42.160 --> 00:55:43.590
themself as a doctor--
for example,

00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:45.130
we saw that in India--

00:55:45.130 --> 00:55:49.120
then you have a very strong
demand for shots and someone

00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.720
who's willing to supply it.

00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.150
You're never going
to experiment

00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:53.990
away from the shorts.

00:55:53.990 --> 00:55:57.430
So every time you're sick,
you're going to get a shot,

00:55:57.430 --> 00:55:59.490
and you're going
to get better.

00:55:59.490 --> 00:56:01.900
And so you're going to think
that your theory was, once

00:56:01.900 --> 00:56:05.260
again, vindicated because you
were sick, you got a shot, now

00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:06.420
you get better.

00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.770
That is going to further
reinforce your belief that

00:56:08.770 --> 00:56:11.000
this was a good theory and
further make you very

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.460
suspicious of not
getting a shot.

00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:18.110
Now of course, if you
experimented once of not

00:56:18.110 --> 00:56:20.140
getting a shot, you would
see, oh, I have

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:21.520
gotten better as well.

00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:25.190
Progressively, your [INAUDIBLE]
would move towards

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.730
something closer to the truth,
which is, let's say, 95% of

00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:31.650
the time you get better with a
shot, and 90% of the time you

00:56:31.650 --> 00:56:33.910
get better without the shot.

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:36.760
But if your beliefs were 95%
of the time you get better

00:56:36.760 --> 00:56:39.950
with a shot and 10% you get
without a shot, then mostly

00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:41.240
you're never going
to experiment.

00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:43.470
You're never going to know,
and you're continuing with

00:56:43.470 --> 00:56:45.000
this very strong belief.

00:56:47.630 --> 00:56:49.690
So this is for self-limiting
diseases.

00:56:49.690 --> 00:56:54.170
And now if you take a disease
like diabetes, or chest pains,

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:57.290
or something like that that
doesn't go away with the shot,

00:56:57.290 --> 00:57:00.700
when you go to a doctor and get
a shot, it doesn't go, so

00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:02.060
progressively your [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:02.060 --> 00:57:05.930
are going to be that everything
is useless, at

00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:07.926
which point you might as
well go to [INAUDIBLE].

00:57:11.770 --> 00:57:16.020
It might be why we see this
paradoxical result of people

00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:18.910
spending a lot of money on
diseases that would cure

00:57:18.910 --> 00:57:22.770
themselves anyway and not doing
really any attempt to

00:57:22.770 --> 00:57:24.880
treat seriously the
diseases that they

00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.600
should treat seriously.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.330
Because the disease that they
should treat seriously are

00:57:29.330 --> 00:57:32.660
beyond the ability of the
Bengali doctor to handle,

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:35.050
because first order,
the Bengali doctor

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:37.380
can't handle nothing.

00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:39.940
So the Bengali doctor end
up spending [INAUDIBLE]

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:42.960
distributed this antibiotics
for diseases that fixes

00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.560
themselves anyway.

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.700
People don't get any form of
treatment for things that they

00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:48.910
should really try and treat,
which would be much more

00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:52.310
complicated to treat, and
you get this no learning

00:57:52.310 --> 00:57:56.990
equilibrium that is very
difficult to get away from.

00:57:56.990 --> 00:58:00.660
And it will be harder to
attribute it to nothing, so

00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:04.380
the tendency to over medicate
is a very [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:04.950
tendency.

00:58:04.950 --> 00:58:09.350
And in fact, this tendency to
over medicate is not something

00:58:09.350 --> 00:58:11.560
that you only have in
poor countries.

00:58:11.560 --> 00:58:13.410
In rich countries, when
you go to the doctor

00:58:13.410 --> 00:58:14.930
and they tell you--

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:17.770
like when I arrived in the US,
my first doctor visit was you

00:58:17.770 --> 00:58:20.175
should breathe under the shower,
and I was like, what

00:58:20.175 --> 00:58:21.130
are you talking about?

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:24.010
Like in my country, I would
have gotten an antibiotic

00:58:24.010 --> 00:58:26.150
immediately.

00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:29.640
So our own tendency is always
you must do something about

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:32.090
me, like you should be
able to do something,

00:58:32.090 --> 00:58:34.150
not just let it go.

00:58:34.150 --> 00:58:36.510
And the only reason why doctors
don't do it here is

00:58:36.510 --> 00:58:39.020
because they are under
guidelines, and they have

00:58:39.020 --> 00:58:40.830
regulations from their
hospital, from their

00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:42.810
association, from what
they have learned to

00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:44.770
not do these things.

00:58:44.770 --> 00:58:49.603
Now preventive care is even
worse because with preventive

00:58:49.603 --> 00:58:53.780
care you are taking an action
today to prevent something to

00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:56.725
happen in the future, but
far away in the future.

00:58:59.450 --> 00:59:05.500
For example, you breast feed
your child so that the child

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.580
gets stronger in the future and
doesn't get sick in the

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:11.280
future, or I guess with
breastfeeding it's also avoid

00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:13.650
diarrhea in the meantime.

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:17.680
But for immunization, you get
immunized, and then you don't

00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:19.540
get measles at some point.

00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:22.630
So linking the two is
very difficult.

00:59:22.630 --> 00:59:26.970
And I think Noah had made this
point with respect to

00:59:26.970 --> 00:59:31.390
deworming, it's even harder when
you're immunized against

00:59:31.390 --> 00:59:38.310
communicable diseases, because
even if you do get immunized

00:59:38.310 --> 00:59:40.770
and people around you don't get
immunized, if there are

00:59:40.770 --> 00:59:42.270
enough people who
get immunized,

00:59:42.270 --> 00:59:44.920
then no one gets measles.

00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:47.650
So the fact that you got
immunized protects other

00:59:47.650 --> 00:59:50.600
people around you as well, so
what you're seeing is that,

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:55.880
oh, this whole immunization
thing, now I got it, and now,

00:59:55.880 --> 00:59:58.420
yes, it's true my kid doesn't
have measles, but no one has

00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:02.910
measles, so clearly it is not
because I got immunized that I

01:00:02.910 --> 01:00:03.900
didn't get it.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:06.400
Now of course, it is because
collectively there was

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:11.190
immunization around, but it's
very difficult to infer.

01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:15.820
If you remember the results of
the deworming study, when

01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.950
people had more friends around
them who got the deworming,

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:21.500
they were actually less likely
to get dewormed.

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:25.700
And one possible explanation
is that initially they were

01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:28.740
convinced by the people that
deworming would make their

01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.780
kids less sick, but then they
saw all of these kids around

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:35.137
them who don't get dewormed and
don't get sick either, and

01:00:35.137 --> 01:00:36.230
so they're saying what
is the point?

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:37.480
I don't need to do it.

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:43.130
So this is basically
not something that

01:00:43.130 --> 01:00:46.780
we can learn ourselves.

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:51.740
In a lot of our own lives, for
example if you try to go

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:57.240
afield, and you do something,
like, for example, plant in

01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:00.740
rows instead of scatter plant,
you see immediately that your

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.000
plant is doing better.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.950
So you can progressively
experiment with better

01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:09.630
techniques, and you will
get better at it.

01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:13.835
So in most of our lives, we
experiment things, and we kind

01:01:13.835 --> 01:01:16.180
of see the results, or at least
we have a sense of what

01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:19.850
the results are, and we can
adjust our behavior.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:22.950
With health, our own
experience, or own

01:01:22.950 --> 01:01:26.320
observations, is very misleading
most of the time.

01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:29.160
We think we can infer from our
actions something that we

01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:30.730
cannot really infer.

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:33.170
It's not because of the medicine
that we got better.

01:01:33.170 --> 01:01:38.410
We think we can infer from
not seeing a result from

01:01:38.410 --> 01:01:41.430
immunization that immunization
was not working, et cetera.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:44.060
So it is just not possible to
learn, because the object is

01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.810
too complicated.

01:01:45.810 --> 01:01:47.840
So how do we learn
about health?

01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:49.280
The answer is we don't.

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:52.240
Well, you guys might because
you've first taken biology, so

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:54.460
you have some sense of it.

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:59.670
But most of us just don't have
anything to do, no real

01:01:59.670 --> 01:02:05.190
understanding of why medicines
are working unless we have red

01:02:05.190 --> 01:02:06.640
stuff on the side.

01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:08.730
But still, when our doctor
says you don't need an

01:02:08.730 --> 01:02:10.970
antibiotic to cure that,
we trust them.

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:13.180
We trust them because they have
spent a lot of money and

01:02:13.180 --> 01:02:16.850
a lot of time getting a health
care education, and we believe

01:02:16.850 --> 01:02:19.090
that there is something
into it.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:21.730
And that trust, same thing
with immunization.

01:02:21.730 --> 01:02:25.620
We get immunized because we are
told to get immunized and

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:27.140
not because we understand
how it works.

01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.030
Not at all.

01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:31.390
So it's got nothing to do with
our education or our superior

01:02:31.390 --> 01:02:32.590
intelligence.

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:36.410
And in face, this trust
is quite fragile.

01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:41.560
You see it eroding reasonably
easily when something happens.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:49.520
so for example, there has been a
few well-publicized articles

01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:54.530
linking the measles vaccine,
which is MMR--

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:57.610
Measles something Rubella,
MMR vaccine--

01:02:57.610 --> 01:02:58.830
and autism.

01:02:58.830 --> 01:03:04.620
There's been some court cases,
et cetera, which have been

01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:11.070
actually the people who were
suing against the vaccine have

01:03:11.070 --> 01:03:11.740
generally lost.

01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:15.270
But despite the fact, there
is pretty much ingrained

01:03:15.270 --> 01:03:18.500
somewhere in the collective
mentality the idea that, in

01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:21.830
fact, MMR vaccines might
cause autism.

01:03:21.830 --> 01:03:25.900
And as result, there is
kind of an epidemic of

01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:31.130
non-vaccination for measles
which has led in some places

01:03:31.130 --> 01:03:34.780
to measles outbreaks that you
didn't used to have before.

01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:38.050
So these things are actually
reasonably fragile.

01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:40.200
If you're interested in that,
there is a book by a New

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:43.830
Yorker journalist called
Michael Specter called

01:03:43.830 --> 01:03:47.780
Denialism which has a very
interesting chapter on this

01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:49.930
vaccination in the US.

01:03:49.930 --> 01:03:55.130
And this vaccination in the US
story reminded me of polio

01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:56.460
vaccine in India.

01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:58.920
Polio vaccine is one thing
that for some reason the

01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:01.000
government of India has decided
that they are going to

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.400
really do, so most kids do
get the polio vaccine.

01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.730
But there are pockets where it's
not being done, and they

01:04:09.730 --> 01:04:13.960
tend to be mostly in villages
which are refusing the polio

01:04:13.960 --> 01:04:18.610
drugs, and the reason is that
they say it's an attempt to

01:04:18.610 --> 01:04:20.300
sterilize us.

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.480
And why would they have this
idea that might sound a little

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:25.750
bit bizarre?

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:30.130
It is linked to the fact that
long time ago, during the

01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:33.390
emergency period which is a when
Indira Ghandi suspended

01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:37.770
the civil liberty, there was
a big drive to encourage

01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:41.370
sterilization of people who
had at least two children.

01:04:41.370 --> 01:04:45.270
And this big drive took a shape
that with sometimes

01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:49.640
quite unacceptable, including
rounding up people who had no

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:52.310
desire being sterilized,
including lying to people

01:04:52.310 --> 01:04:55.320
about what was being done
to them, et cetera.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.530
And this has created this huge
mistrust, in particular in the

01:04:58.530 --> 01:05:02.960
Muslim population, about what
government's trying to do to

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.680
them under the guise of doing
something good for them.

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:10.410
And so there are regions where
people will simply not accept

01:05:10.410 --> 01:05:12.500
to be immunized.

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.370
This is an extreme.

01:05:13.370 --> 01:05:15.760
Those are two extreme cases
where people have a strong

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:16.900
belief against.

01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:20.110
If you do that here in this
region, giving people lentils

01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:21.480
to immunize them
will not work.

01:05:21.480 --> 01:05:23.930
In fact, it might be
counterproductive because they

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:26.790
might think that you're trying
to fool them like they did

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.930
with the sterilization
already.

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:32.730
But more generally, the fact
that people are generally

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:36.800
indifferent about preventive
care might be related to the

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.470
fact that they don't think
there is some grand

01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:39.120
conspiration.

01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.960
They just think you're
bullshitting them like you

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.210
always are.

01:05:44.610 --> 01:05:46.850
And once this trust is eroded,
then it's very

01:05:46.850 --> 01:05:48.100
difficult to go back.

01:05:50.310 --> 01:05:53.820
AUDIENCE: I think in America,
don't most people figure out

01:05:53.820 --> 01:05:55.700
all these things about
vaccination and

01:05:55.700 --> 01:05:56.925
preventive care work?

01:05:56.925 --> 01:06:01.020
There's a reason because they
have a family care doctor who

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:01.440
tells them?

01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.818
There's some figure of authority
that you can trust

01:06:03.818 --> 01:06:06.248
that tells them that
these things work.

01:06:06.248 --> 01:06:09.650
I'm guessing most Americans
don't know how vaccines work.

01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:11.108
PROFESSOR: That's
exactly right.

01:06:11.108 --> 01:06:14.510
AUDIENCE: So if you have the
same thing in India or in

01:06:14.510 --> 01:06:19.895
Africa, figures of authority
that have been mandated by

01:06:19.895 --> 01:06:23.099
some government agency or some
school that tells them that

01:06:23.099 --> 01:06:25.811
they know about this stuff,
telling them that, wouldn't

01:06:25.811 --> 01:06:27.290
that [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:27.290 --> 01:06:28.769
PROFESSOR: That's
exactly right.

01:06:28.769 --> 01:06:31.330
The question is, who is this
figure of authority?

01:06:31.330 --> 01:06:37.100
In the US, except for examples
like this autism in the US

01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:40.640
where there was some idea of
conspiracy theory, where big

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.920
pharma is trying to make our
children autistic and things

01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:50.050
like that, except in those
cases, we have a

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:51.490
basic sense of trust.

01:06:51.490 --> 01:06:54.320
That if your doctor tells you
to do something, you think

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:55.600
they must know what it
is they're doing.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:58.060
You don't understand what
is going on, but

01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:00.200
you still trust them.

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.520
But the problem with a place
like India, for example, is

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:08.450
whether this authority figure
exists or whether they are

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:10.310
interested in preventive care.

01:07:10.310 --> 01:07:13.435
So in India, this sterilization
campaign that I

01:07:13.435 --> 01:07:18.520
was talking about had very, very
long-lasting damage of

01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:22.160
convincing people that the
government was quite liable to

01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:25.660
lie to them on any matter
involving health.

01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:28.800
So people are quite suspicious,
and if enough tell

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:31.500
them you should get polio drugs,
they're thinking he's

01:07:31.500 --> 01:07:33.120
trying to do something
else to me.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.060
She's trying to get
me sterilized.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:39.480
So once the trust is eroded,
someone who is mandated by the

01:07:39.480 --> 01:07:46.350
government is someone who a
priori you should not believe,

01:07:46.350 --> 01:07:50.080
so that the government becomes
a negative, not a positive.

01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:53.380
AUDIENCE: So [INAUDIBLE] like
a Muslim doctor [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.077
saying [INAUDIBLE] the fact that
we've been mandated by

01:07:57.077 --> 01:07:58.705
the government or [INAUDIBLE].

01:07:58.705 --> 01:07:59.800
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:00.686
[INAUDIBLE]

01:08:00.686 --> 01:08:02.768
so you would need also
authority figure once

01:08:02.768 --> 01:08:03.750
you've eroded it.

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:06.400
And once you've eroded the
trust, it takes a lot of time

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:09.060
to rebuild it again,
but you can have

01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.090
other authority figures.

01:08:10.090 --> 01:08:14.270
So in Phuket, for example, in
the movie, you remember, there

01:08:14.270 --> 01:08:18.760
is a doctor from an NGO who is
talking about the Bengali

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:21.609
doctors sometimes being good,
sometimes being bad, and about

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:23.710
the kids with the long hair.

01:08:23.710 --> 01:08:28.850
So this doctor used to work in
a small hospital run by a

01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:33.439
couple doctors.

01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:37.250
In this area, everybody was
immunized, everybody was

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:39.080
always going to them, everybody
was getting

01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:42.350
preventive care because that
have established that trust.

01:08:42.350 --> 01:08:47.029
But the point of it is how do
you establish the trust?

01:08:47.029 --> 01:08:52.960
They were on a very small area,
the government has a lot

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.800
of power to reach a lot of
people, but once they have

01:08:55.800 --> 01:09:00.750
misused it once, or twice, or
three times, the temptation to

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:03.960
use the trust that you have from
the people to get them to

01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.590
do things that are not
necessarily in their interest

01:09:06.590 --> 01:09:07.939
is very strong.

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:09.700
And once you have done
that, then it's

01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.461
difficult to get back.

01:09:11.461 --> 01:09:14.239
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:14.239 --> 01:09:18.521
For example, in the movie that
we watched, there were a lot

01:09:18.521 --> 01:09:22.473
of people who would choose
to go to the [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:22.473 --> 01:09:25.439
instead of going to
the actual doctor.

01:09:25.439 --> 01:09:29.420
Is there any initiative where
people actually use those

01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:39.842
entities to actually provide the
population with medicine?

01:09:39.842 --> 01:09:45.166
I know in Brazil, there's parts
of it where for a lot of

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:52.790
people who were dying with
diarrhea, people use like

01:09:52.790 --> 01:09:59.490
these women that were supposed
to be known to help them

01:09:59.490 --> 01:10:03.541
somehow, and they were more not
really like the typical

01:10:03.541 --> 01:10:06.240
doctor, but they were more
like the cultural thing.

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.845
And [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:07.845 --> 01:10:15.220
those persons to deliver
the [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:20.200
or dehydration solution to
actually help those people who

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:21.196
were dying.

01:10:21.196 --> 01:10:22.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:23.510
I think that's a great idea.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:24.650
I think it's been tried.

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:27.240
The problem is that then you
need to be able to control

01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:29.870
these people, because they
already have some authority,

01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:33.750
and then you give them some more
authority, and then you

01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:37.060
really are wary of what
they start to say.

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:39.690
So you don't want to transform
them into a collection of

01:10:39.690 --> 01:10:42.160
Bengali doctors that are going
to give them-- if the

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.640
[INAUDIBLE] start giving
antibiotics,

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.890
then you're in trouble.

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:52.640
But your idea is exactly right,
is that basically once

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:55.400
you've shut down the traditional
channels, which

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:58.320
would be your family doctor
that you trust, how do you

01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.280
reconstruct some measure of
communication that comes from

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.700
other channels?

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.110
And these could be
the [INAUDIBLE].

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:07.310
These could be television that
a lot of people watch.

01:11:12.230 --> 01:11:15.030
In Brazil, actually, it's
not about health,

01:11:15.030 --> 01:11:17.422
but it's about fertility.

01:11:17.422 --> 01:11:20.560
People were all watching the
soap opera, and in the soap

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:23.720
opera, the cool people have
very few children.

01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:27.680
And there was a study that
was done looking at the

01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:29.740
penetration of the soap opera.

01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:33.120
It was on network TV, so it's
not always available, but it

01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.060
became progressively available
in part of Brazil.

01:11:36.060 --> 01:11:39.150
So you can follow the fertility
as it becomes

01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:41.370
available in the different
part of Brazil.

01:11:41.370 --> 01:11:43.620
And you observe two interesting
things.

01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:46.090
One is that as it became
available, people had fewer

01:11:46.090 --> 01:11:49.010
kids, and the second is those
kids tended to be poor.

01:11:49.010 --> 01:11:53.890
Like the name of the soap opera
heroine, the kids had

01:11:53.890 --> 01:11:56.750
started to have those names,
which is like the other.

01:11:56.750 --> 01:12:02.280
So other things like that you
could try and view imbue.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:05.390
I haven't seen evolutions of
trying to get health messages

01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:07.490
to go through the television,
but these are things that you

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:10.786
could also try, so use
those other channels.

01:12:10.786 --> 01:12:13.960
In the last five minutes, I want
to say something about

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.240
the present and the future.

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:20.160
That's something we are going
to get back again, which is

01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:24.700
kind of elaborating on the point
you were making before.

01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:27.490
Another problem is that the
preventive health cost are

01:12:27.490 --> 01:12:30.330
incurred today, but the benefits
are in the future,

01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:32.350
and furthermore, as you
pointed out, in

01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:34.160
the uncertain future.

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:37.280
Like, it is going
to happen later.

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:40.860
So even if you know that it
prevents getting measles, you

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:44.990
don't know whether you would
really have gotten measles,

01:12:44.990 --> 01:12:48.530
and it's in the future,
sometime later.

01:12:48.530 --> 01:12:51.720
And it turns out, which you
can easily verify from

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.440
introspection, is that human
beings-- not only the poor,

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.220
but the poor, the
rich, everyone--

01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.270
tends to put much more weight
on the present than in the

01:12:59.270 --> 01:13:00.980
entire future.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.590
This is something different than
your regular discounting

01:13:03.590 --> 01:13:06.900
that today is more important
than tomorrow, and tomorrow is

01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:09.840
more important than day after
tomorrow, et cetera.

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.370
This is something that today is
much, much more important

01:13:13.370 --> 01:13:16.920
than tomorrow, and then tomorrow
and day after,

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.162
tomorrow is little bit more
important than day after, and

01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:21.140
day after a little bit more
important than the following

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:22.090
day, et cetera.

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:25.680
But today is much, much more
important compared to the

01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:28.860
entire future in what we're
thinking about.

01:13:28.860 --> 01:13:33.130
That's true for consumption, so
you would like to save for

01:13:33.130 --> 01:13:34.520
your retirement, but
not starting

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:36.620
today, starting tomorrow.

01:13:36.620 --> 01:13:39.640
It's the same with time.

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:44.050
I gave you the flexibility of
when you're doing essays for

01:13:44.050 --> 01:13:48.280
this class, but I did warn you
that in my experience, a lot

01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.990
of students will decide to do
the five last essays because

01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:54.450
they think from today that
it's the absolute optimal

01:13:54.450 --> 01:13:56.280
thing to do because now
you're very busy.

01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.320
But of course at the end of
the semester when all the

01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:00.820
projects are due, and the
exams too, you'll

01:14:00.820 --> 01:14:02.660
have much more time.

01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:07.220
So this is something that it
doesn't take much to realize

01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.330
that there is this problem.

01:14:09.330 --> 01:14:11.590
And not only we have this
problem, but we are not fully

01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:12.870
aware of it.

01:14:12.870 --> 01:14:15.880
Because if we were fully aware
of it, you would write me an

01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:21.990
email and say can I please
commit to a schedule of essays

01:14:21.990 --> 01:14:26.980
and ask Laura or Millicent
to enforce them.

01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:31.560
We realize to some extent,
but we overestimate.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:35.090
We're thinking that today, the
present is very important, but

01:14:35.090 --> 01:14:38.250
that tomorrow we will start
being reasonable people again.

01:14:38.250 --> 01:14:39.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.210
PROFESSOR: And now tomorrow
comes, and tomorrow becomes

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:47.550
today, and again today is so
important, and we get fooled

01:14:47.550 --> 01:14:49.790
by ourselves like
that repeatedly.

01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:52.530
So with the immunization, you
can think this can be

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:54.750
available every month.

01:14:54.750 --> 01:14:59.070
So you're today I'm just so
busy, I can't go, but I will

01:14:59.070 --> 01:15:00.130
go next month.

01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:02.990
Then next month comes, and
then it's next month.

01:15:02.990 --> 01:15:05.610
And next month is now today,
and you're so busy

01:15:05.610 --> 01:15:06.810
that you can't go.

01:15:06.810 --> 01:15:09.526
And that's way, you could
procrastinate.

01:15:09.526 --> 01:15:11.438
AUDIENCE: After [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:11.438 --> 01:15:13.828
an experiment with decreasing
incentives?

01:15:13.828 --> 01:15:17.891
Like if you said people who turn
in essays, like the first

01:15:17.891 --> 01:15:20.495
five would get 10 extra points,
and the next five

01:15:20.495 --> 01:15:23.405
wouldn't get 10 extra points,
most people would do the first

01:15:23.405 --> 01:15:24.860
five essays just
to [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:25.345
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:15:25.345 --> 01:15:26.315
You're exactly right.

01:15:26.315 --> 01:15:29.540
The intuition is exactly right,
which is if we suffer

01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:34.250
from things like that, giving
us small incentive to act

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:39.510
today rather than tomorrow
will help.

01:15:39.510 --> 01:15:42.100
For example, this idea of saying
if you're doing the

01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:45.570
first five, you're getting 10
extra points for the first

01:15:45.570 --> 01:15:46.820
five, that helps.

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:52.400
I could also have a
disincentive, which is to say

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:55.730
you get 10 negative points
if you give them later.

01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:58.910
In principle, if you have some
awareness of this problem, you

01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:01.910
should like this program,
because you should like the

01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:05.670
idea of putting some incentive
on yourself to act today

01:16:05.670 --> 01:16:07.320
rather than tomorrow.

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:10.520
And so with preventive care,
the problem is that in the

01:16:10.520 --> 01:16:16.470
developing world, the costs tend
to be higher than for us.

01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:19.140
With immunization, like not only
you have to go, but half

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.660
of the time she's not there,
and all of that.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.510
So it's constructed exactly
the other way, which is a

01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:28.010
small cost, everything becomes a
little bit more complicated.

01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:32.010
In our lives, everything is
structured to make the small

01:16:32.010 --> 01:16:36.200
cost less costly, and also
to impose schedule on us.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:39.640
For example, for immunization,
you have a calendar that is

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.090
given by the government that
you have to follow.

01:16:42.090 --> 01:16:44.460
Otherwise the kids can't go to
school, but since kids have to

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:46.480
be in school, you have
to follow that.

01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:49.410
So it's a form of incentive,
very strong incentive, to make

01:16:49.410 --> 01:16:50.650
it compulsory.

01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:54.360
And the lentils is saying
there is a small cost of

01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:57.860
going, but in extent of this
small cost, you get a small

01:16:57.860 --> 01:17:00.740
benefit, which is the lentils.

01:17:00.740 --> 01:17:05.030
And so that can help
people to go.

01:17:05.030 --> 01:17:07.230
And you're right that combining
your two ideas, I

01:17:07.230 --> 01:17:10.320
could say you're going to get
a bigger incentive if you

01:17:10.320 --> 01:17:12.520
follow the schedule than
if you go at any point.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:15.130
And that way, that gives
us a strong sense

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:16.630
of doing it on time.

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:24.640
So these procrastination issues,
combining with the

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:30.050
fact that people have probably
not a full understanding of

01:17:30.050 --> 01:17:36.160
the benefits, could explain why
we see this huge waste.

01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:39.330
Because we really have to call
this as a waste, all of this.

01:17:39.330 --> 01:17:40.790
Kids who are not immunized.

01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:42.570
Kids who are not dewormed.

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:46.500
Kids who drink dirty water,
and adults also.

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:50.620
And that could come from this
combination of not fully

01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:55.060
understand the benefits, not
trusting what you are told,

01:17:55.060 --> 01:17:58.710
and the disproportionate
importance of small cost.

01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:00.420
How can we solve it?

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:02.100
Well, we can solve it by making

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:04.020
things as easy as possible.

01:18:04.020 --> 01:18:06.990
This is what we benefit from.

01:18:06.990 --> 01:18:10.330
When you open the tap in your
water, there is chlorine that

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:11.040
comes, right?

01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:13.630
You don't have to remember
to add the tablet.

01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:16.330
So making things automatic
and defaulted.

01:18:16.330 --> 01:18:19.210
And when it's not possible, like
you're not a very well

01:18:19.210 --> 01:18:22.090
organized country like India,
giving people small rewards

01:18:22.090 --> 01:18:27.210
that are offsetting the small
cost, if possible exactly in

01:18:27.210 --> 01:18:30.050
the way that you're talking
about it, which is [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:30.050 --> 01:18:32.720
people to do it later
rather than earlier.

01:18:35.330 --> 01:18:38.230
That means that charging a small
amount for goods may be

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:40.740
totally counterproductive
because you might lose a lot

01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:43.320
of people when you have your
entire infrastructure to

01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:44.860
deliver the goods.

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:48.235
And giving small incentive might
actually be productive.

01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.010
The last word would be--

01:18:58.170 --> 01:19:00.630
and that's the question of the
bed net that we spent a whole

01:19:00.630 --> 01:19:04.080
lecture on-- is it going to have
some bad effect in the

01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:07.590
future if people are used to
be helped in this way?

01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:09.260
And I think the answer
is two prongs.

01:19:09.260 --> 01:19:11.150
Some of these problems
are here to stay.

01:19:11.150 --> 01:19:13.220
It's not that we have them
today, and it will be better

01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.100
in the future.

01:19:14.100 --> 01:19:15.410
We always have those problems.

01:19:15.410 --> 01:19:19.280
That's why immunization in the
US is free and compulsory, and

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.080
it's going to be forever.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.440
We're not expecting that one day
people will now understand

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.570
the value and will start
doing it on their own.

01:19:27.570 --> 01:19:31.310
Secondly is when we think about
the dynamic effect, we

01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:33.490
also have to include learning.

01:19:33.490 --> 01:19:37.840
And because of the lack of trust
and people don't just

01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.900
believe you because you say
something, the fact of giving

01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:44.900
people an occasion to try for
themselves by making things

01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:48.060
very easy and cheap may actually
have those dynamic

01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:50.830
effects that are positive
because of the learning.

01:19:50.830 --> 01:19:53.850
Which is exactly what we
saw with the bed nets.

01:19:53.850 --> 01:19:57.730
We don't need to go over it
again, but with the bed net,

01:19:57.730 --> 01:19:59.450
people were probably relatively
suspicious about

01:19:59.450 --> 01:20:01.510
the effectiveness of
those bed nets.

01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:02.730
You give them one--

01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:04.670
[INAUDIBLE] not willing
to pay the cost.

01:20:04.670 --> 01:20:06.730
You give them one for free,
and then they realize the

01:20:06.730 --> 01:20:09.850
benefits are bigger than what
they were, and that can

01:20:09.850 --> 01:20:12.690
overcome the small cost to get
the benefits in the future now

01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:16.940
that they're convinced that
those benefits actually exist.

01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:19.670
So we're done with health, and
we are going to start with

01:20:19.670 --> 01:20:20.920
education next time.

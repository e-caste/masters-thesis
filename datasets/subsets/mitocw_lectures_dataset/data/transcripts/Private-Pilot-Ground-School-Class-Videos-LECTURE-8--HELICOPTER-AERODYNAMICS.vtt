PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Quick introduction.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:16.250
I know hardly anybody says
they care about helicopters.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.830
But as God is my witness,
I'm going to change that.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.210
If I can reach one of you
airplane obsessed folks,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.120
I will do my best.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.110
So what is cool
about a helicopter?

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.320
Here, it's the view.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.320
So let's start, first and
foremost, it's a view.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.430
So these are some
pictures that I

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.490
snapped on a trip from
the Robinson factory

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.330
in Los Angeles back to Boston.

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:51.400
Who recognizes the
city in the middle?

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.320
Ooh, some Midwesterners
here, Chicago indeed.

00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:04.769
Of course this is the Stata
Center where we'll be tomorrow,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.330
remember that, 32 141.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.160
What are the parts
of the helicopter?

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.490
If you're between
ages 3 and 5, it's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.540
acceptable to call it the
thing on the top the propeller

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.220
but older than that, it's
better to say main rotor system.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.840
Tail rotor is in
the back-- we'll

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.790
talk about why we
need that in a minute.

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.540
You got to have transmissions.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.190
In helicopters, the
speed of the engine

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.190
is never the speed that
you want, I don't think.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.290
And landing gear
is kind of nice.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.180
Although for
record-setting flights,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.250
sometimes people
have taken them off

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.230
to try to get a little
higher a little faster,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.730
and then they just
land very gently.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.250
So your typical
helicopter drive train

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.938
will have transmissions
for both the main rotor,

00:01:58.938 --> 00:02:00.480
and they'll have
another transmission

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.900
to adjust the speed of the
tail, maybe gear it back up

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.000
a little bit.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
This unfortunately does
introduce another source

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.500
of unreliability.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.560
So in the airplane,
you've got your engine,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.970
it's bolted to the propeller.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.620
As long as the engine's turning,
it's hard to have a problem.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.365
The propellers don't generally
just come apart in flight.

00:02:20.365 --> 00:02:21.740
But here with the
helicopter, you

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.365
might have a working
engine and working

00:02:23.365 --> 00:02:26.240
main rotor and the transmission,
all the oil might come out

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.522
and the gears seize up.

00:02:28.522 --> 00:02:30.980
There's a couple of warning
lights in there for when you're

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.230
having a transmission problem.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.800
This is the rubber
belt system that's

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.290
used in some piston helicopters.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.320
I think this is probably a
drawing off of a Robinson.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.490
But basically, you have
pulleys on the engine side

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.550
and on the drive change side,
and you have these rubber belts

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:52.270
connecting them.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.615
So you can start your
engine with the belts loose

00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:55.990
and then tighten
them up when you

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.607
want the engine to begin
driving the rotor system,

00:02:58.607 --> 00:03:00.940
that way you don't have to
have the little starter motor

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.550
actually turn all
the rotors and stuff.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.120
How does it work?

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.800
So Tina is a hard act to follow
with my cave person computer

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.350
programmers
understanding of lift.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:21.520
But if you assume that the lift
is a combination of Newton's

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.200
third law and the Bernoulli
principle, the sped up air

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.720
has more kinetic
energy, therefore

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.160
for conservation
of energy, it has

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.780
to have less of
something else, it's

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.940
going to have lower
static pressure.

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.910
So here's one of the
FAs diagrams here.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.160
We have velocity and
pressure that are equal.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.370
They go into the Venturi.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:42.760
The velocity is higher,
the pressure is lower,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.890
so the energy of the
air is still the same.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.680
And it comes out again at the
same velocity and pressure.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.700
So you're getting
lift from the wing

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.560
from both Newton's
third law just

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.080
pushing air down
makes the wing go up

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.380
and the Bernoulli principle of
generating some low pressure.

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.015
This is the same drawing
you saw earlier of how

00:04:03.015 --> 00:04:05.140
when you exceed a certain
critical angle of attack,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.650
depending on the
air foil, your lift

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.370
party comes to a quick end.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.470
It doesn't go away completely,
but it's a sudden drop.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.910
Angle of attack, so remember
there's your cord line,

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.160
there's your relative wind,
4 degree angle of attack

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.970
and a reasonable amount
of forward speed.

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.630
Remember the lift varies
is the speed squared

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:31.950
will have you going.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.890
And if you want to
fly slowly, you just

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.720
go to higher and higher
angles of attack.

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.500
So why not hover
in your Cessna 172

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.710
and save yourself the trouble
of getting a helicopter rating?

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.110
It's because you know
off the right end

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.560
of this chart you quickly get
to the stalling angle of attack

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.570
and the plane
doesn't fly anymore.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.970
So there's an FA drawing I
think from the pilots handbook

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.210
where the airflow becomes
turbulent somewhere between 12

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.630
and 16 degrees angle of attack,
depending on the air foil.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.000
And that's why the
Cessna can't be

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.790
used for hovering operations.

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.760
What if you saw the wing off
the Cessna and spin it around?

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.910
So if you do that,
the wing will always

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:23.350
have airspeed even if the
fuselage is not moving.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.550
And that was an
idea that was first

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.750
reduced to practice in 1907.

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.160
So only four years after
the Wright brothers flew,

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.490
a couple of guys in
France were actually

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:38.350
hovering a little bit
in the helicopter.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.280
The first helicopters that
could be flown and controlled

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.740
and actually operated as
a practical aircraft I

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:51.040
think mid 30s in Germany.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.690
And then Sikorsky is famous
for being the first mass

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.820
producer of helicopters
with the Sikorsky R-4.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.120
It was used for a few
computational purposes

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.110
in World War II, search
and rescue type stuff.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.960
But really, the Korean
War was the first time

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:14.470
that helicopters were
widely used by the military.

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:19.180
Let's talk about a very simple
qualitative physics here.

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.890
We're spending on the ramp.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:31.120
So we spin the rotor
system up to 400 RPM.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.860
But we're still on the ramp.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.560
So does anybody have
a brilliant idea

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.870
for how do we get up into
the air where we want to be?

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.370
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
were negative,

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:46.137
because there [INAUDIBLE]
of the main rotor system.

00:06:46.137 --> 00:06:47.470
PHILIP GREENSPUN: OK, excellent.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.650
So-- what's your name?

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:50.200
Sorry.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.950
AUDIENCE: Aziz.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.070
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Aziz
has a correct observation

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:58.060
that if you want to get
the same lift out of a wing

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.647
without changing the speed,
we don't want to have this--

00:07:00.647 --> 00:07:02.980
we don't want to speed up too
much because the tips will

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:06.070
go supersonic, and the neighbors
will begin to complain.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.290
So we just twist the
blades up a little bit.

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:11.500
And as they're twisted
up, they'll bite more air,

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.780
generate more lift,
and the helicopter

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:16.190
will begin rising up.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:17.440
What will happen to the speed?

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.700
Let's hear from one of these
aeroengineering heroes.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.885
As we generate more
lift, what happens?

00:07:23.885 --> 00:07:25.900
AUDIENCE: You now have
more drag on the rotors,

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.460
so the engine slows down.

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.500
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
More lift, more drag,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:34.222
so without adding more
power, the engine--

00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:36.680
well, without adding more power,
the blades will slow down.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.640
So you want a correlator.

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.030
As you're lifting the collective
control on a helicopter,

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.280
the correlator is
opening the throttle

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.043
and adding more
power automatically.

00:07:48.043 --> 00:07:49.710
And there's also an
electronic governors

00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:53.020
that will just touch that up a
little bit by watching the RPM.

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.690
Turbine helicopters
all have governors.

00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:00.520
Most piston-- Robinsons
have governors, as well.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:03.790
All right, so what if
we're parked on ice?

00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:06.370
Has anybody here seen
my favorite movie,

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.950
Blades of Glory?

00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:11.703
So when Will Ferrell
and his partner,

00:08:11.703 --> 00:08:13.870
what if they're on the ice
and they push each other?

00:08:13.870 --> 00:08:14.412
What happens?

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:22.760
Both go backwards, the
pusher and the pushee.

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:28.840
So keeping in mind Blades of
Glory, an important physics

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:31.330
work, what if we're
parked on the ice?

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.419
What happens to our helicopter
after we start the engine

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:35.700
and start the blades spinning?

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:44.670
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Helicopter
spins the other way, excellent.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:47.490
Yeah, so that's Newton's
third law, once again.

00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:50.070
For every action, there's an
equal and opposite reaction.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.650
You're not going to see that
as dramatically if you're

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.870
parked on pavement,
because of the friction.

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:57.240
So what do we do?

00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.080
We add the tail rotor.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.520
So here are the forces up here.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.200
There's the blade rotation.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.090
There's the torque.

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.510
To counteract the torque,
we've got the tail rotor thrust

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:08.730
to blow the tail
back into position.

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.150
And the only thing here that's
not corrected, you'll notice,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.100
is the tail rotor thrust.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.440
So if you set
everything up the way

00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:19.710
you would think obvious, like
put the rotor mast straight up

00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:22.230
and put the tail rotor on
it, the whole helicopter

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.100
with the controls neutral
would drift to the right

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.950
from the tail rotor thrust.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:30.510
Because it's pushing the tail.

00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:35.960
The helicopter wants
to rotate that way.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.000
The tail rotor blows
it back this way.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
And that would blow
the whole machine

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.640
off the side of the
ramp if the pilot didn't

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.570
hold a lot of left cyclic.

00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.180
So to counteract
that, the helicopters

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.820
are rigged with the mast
at a slight left angle

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:55.160
so that they don't
have this tendency

00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:58.630
to go off to the right.

00:09:58.630 --> 00:10:01.270
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] question,
what does the governor do?

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:03.728
PHILIP GREENSPUN: The governor,
yes, let me reinforce that.

00:10:03.728 --> 00:10:05.230
So yes, as you
generate lift, you

00:10:05.230 --> 00:10:08.230
get more drag, which will
cause the blades to slow down.

00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:10.480
So there's a
mechanical correlation.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.670
As you're raising
the collective,

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:16.480
the throttle's being opened
just kind of blindly.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.700
And the governor is
touching that up.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.440
The governor is
watching and maybe

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.990
twisting the throttle
control slightly

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:25.720
to fine-tune the throttle
to keep the blades exactly

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.950
at 400 RPM.

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:28.630
Let's say that's
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:30.673
For a pilot, pilots are--

00:10:30.673 --> 00:10:32.590
you don't want to distract
the pilot too much,

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:34.600
so the gauge is just
calibrated in percent.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.920
It's 100% RPM.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.760
That's good.

00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.328
That's all you need to
know about your helicopter.

00:10:39.328 --> 00:10:40.870
I think in the
Robinson, it works out

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:43.420
to pretty close to 400 RPM.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.020
All right, forward flight--

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:54.350
so we're hovering and
we want to go forward.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:58.260
So it seems obvious that
we want to tilt the fan.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.370
We want to push the
fan down this way,

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:05.990
and that way, we'll get some
horizontal vector of thrust

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:08.160
and we'll be going forward.

00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:13.640
But where do we push it from?

00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.990
It's a spinning gyro, so
it has a lot of stability.

00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:20.800
If we're really strong and we
reach up from our pilot seat

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.930
and try to nudge
the rotor system,

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.350
why wouldn't that just cause
the helicopter fuselage

00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:30.880
to move underneath the
fixed rotor system,

00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.750
instead of moving
the rotor system?

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:36.850
There's nothing to fix unless
we can call up an incredibly

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.440
strong friend,
and say, would you

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.590
mind holding the helicopter
in a fixed position?

00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:43.930
We don't have anything
to push against in order

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:45.100
to tilt the rotor.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.660
Does that make sense?

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.420
You've got this gyro on top
of you, and disturbing it

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:51.490
is going to take a lot of power.

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:53.500
And even if you
had the strength,

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.670
you don't have anywhere
to stand rigidly and push.

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.080
So what do you think?

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.160
Could the rotor just fly
itself into a new position?

00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:04.510
And how would that work?

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.970
How could you use
the spinning wing

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:11.175
itself to fly itself into
a new tilted-down position?

00:12:11.175 --> 00:12:12.550
Anybody have any
brilliant ideas?

00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:17.830
AUDIENCE: You increase
the angle of attack

00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:19.880
of the blades on one
side [INAUDIBLE]..

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.630
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
What's your name, sorry?

00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:22.390
AUDIENCE: John.

00:12:22.390 --> 00:12:24.015
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
John has a good idea.

00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:26.830
So John says, increase
the angle of attack

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.220
and decrease it as the
blade moves around the disk.

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:33.100
So if you can increase the
lift on part of the disk

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.020
compared to another
part of the disk,

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.730
it will naturally tilt itself.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:38.230
So if you want to
go forward-- let's

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:41.660
ignore gyroscopic
procession for a moment,

00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:44.962
because I think we've proven
that nobody understands it.

00:12:44.962 --> 00:12:47.170
Let's just say that we could
make the angle of attack

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.750
higher on the back of the
disk compared to the front.

00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:52.840
Then the back of the disk
would have more lift.

00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:56.890
It would rise up and the
front would go lower,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.740
and then you would see this
flight path that you do see.

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.060
That make sense?

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.140
So basically, you're basically
flying the rotor system.

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.113
You're not flying
the helicopter.

00:13:07.113 --> 00:13:09.280
The helicopter's just hanging
from the rotor system.

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.040
That's a good mental model.

00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:17.260
And all of the power is from
the engine to the rotor system.

00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:19.270
So that's a natural
place to do it, just

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:22.220
by tweaking the blade
angle as it rotates around.

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.080
So the left hand is collective,
moving the blade's angle

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.860
regardless of where
they are on the disk,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:32.050
and the cyclic, which
is changing the pitch

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:35.090
cyclically as you suggested.

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:36.850
All right, what's the magic?

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:39.100
This design-- I'm
not sure it's really

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.230
changed at all since the
very first helicopters.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.500
Maybe those brothers in Paris
didn't have one in 1907,

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:47.890
but I'm pretty sure that
every helicopter since then

00:13:47.890 --> 00:13:48.910
has had this.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.070
There's a swashplate.

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:59.660
Watch this-- so the lower
part of the swashplate

00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:03.740
here is fixed and connected
to the flight controls.

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.290
And then there's a bearing,
and the upper swashplate

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.940
rotates with the blades.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.630
Does that make sense?

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:12.000
So if you lift the
lower swashplate up,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.310
that pushes the
upper swashplate up,

00:14:14.310 --> 00:14:19.030
which pushes these
rods that are connected

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:20.590
to a corner of the blade.

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:23.290
And that'll cause the blades
to tilt. That make sense?

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:24.790
So you have this
rotating swashplate

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.880
that's connected to a
corner of the blade.

00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.860
And if you push
the whole thing up

00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:32.590
by yanking up on the
collective, then you

00:14:32.590 --> 00:14:34.150
can see the blades
actually twist.

00:14:34.150 --> 00:14:37.390
You can do that in the hangar
and see the effect of this.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:42.580
At the same time, in your
right hand is the cyclic.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.360
And with the cyclic, you're
tilting the swashplate.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:48.730
So with the tilted
swashplate, that

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:54.700
will just cause the
blades to twist up

00:14:54.700 --> 00:14:57.110
and twist down as they rotate.

00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:59.980
So it's a pretty
elegant solution.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.110
This is not carrying much of
the load of the helicopter.

00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:05.110
There's still a mast
holding the whole thing up.

00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:08.500
This really just has
to carry enough force

00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.763
to twist the blades up and
down, up and down, up and down.

00:15:11.763 --> 00:15:13.180
So that's your
engineering design.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:21.180
Everybody appreciates that?

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:24.750
Do we want to take off straight
up like in a Hollywood movie?

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:28.410
Well, if you have one or two
people in a helicopter designed

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:32.310
for four or five,
you actually do

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.690
have enough power to do that.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.140
However, there is
something over here

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:40.160
on the right called the
"height velocity diagram."

00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.800
And you can see it says, "avoid
operation in shaded areas."

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:48.780
So they're saying-- we'll
talk about this maybe a little

00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:50.940
later if people are interested.

00:15:54.090 --> 00:16:01.640
But if you are, let's say, up
at 200 feet at zero airspeed,

00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.480
so you're just parked, hovering
200 feet above the ground,

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:11.960
you don't have huge stores
of forward speed, which

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:14.660
is kinetic energy,
or potential energy,

00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.400
because you're only up 200 feet.

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.790
So it's going to be hard to
do an auto-rotation that's

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:22.550
perfect and doesn't bend
anything, especially

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:25.190
because the FAA says, if
you're up high like that

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.580
and the engine
quits, in test pilot,

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.640
you have to sit there with
your arms folded for one second

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.040
and do nothing, because
that's what would probably

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.210
happen in real life.

00:16:35.210 --> 00:16:36.950
You'd be surprised.

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:40.130
People can do
auto-rotations from 200 feet

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:42.343
and land perfectly, but
they know it's coming.

00:16:42.343 --> 00:16:43.760
They chop the
throttle themselves.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:45.630
They immediately put
the collective down

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.880
and they do the auto-rotation.

00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.180
So but basically, if you're
a pilot of average skill

00:16:50.180 --> 00:16:52.490
and you don't do anything
for about a second

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.130
after the engine
quits, then this

00:16:55.130 --> 00:16:57.440
is supposed to keep
you safe, by you either

00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:03.650
fly 50 knots or faster, or you
fly 400 feet or higher at sea

00:17:03.650 --> 00:17:07.351
level, and higher than
that at high altitude.

00:17:10.170 --> 00:17:12.690
So what we're actually
recommended to do--

00:17:12.690 --> 00:17:14.660
see this recommended
takeoff profile--

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:18.083
is skim along the ground until
we get up to about 45 knots

00:17:18.083 --> 00:17:19.500
and then let the
helicopter climb.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.670
I think this is the
curve for a Robinson R44.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:25.520
Why would you want to do
that, aside from safety?

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.740
Another good reason
to do that is you

00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:32.490
watch these drag
versus speed curves,

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:35.310
and you see that you
reach kind of a minimum.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:38.280
This is some generic
helicopter from an FAA book.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.680
It's actually 55 knots
for the Robinson.

00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:43.440
But if you can go 55
knots, you need less energy

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.580
than any other airspeed.

00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.100
So the idea for a takeoff
is you nudge the helicopter

00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:49.750
forward a little bit.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.600
If you can build up
two knots of speed,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.520
that gives you excess power.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:57.652
You can use that excess power
to climb up three inches

00:17:57.652 --> 00:17:59.860
or you can use that excess
power to accelerate, maybe

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:01.450
to three or four knots.

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:03.160
And if you just
keep accelerating

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:04.750
using your extra
power to accelerate,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:06.730
the faster you go, the
less power you need.

00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.800
So even if you've never
touched the collective

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.780
or drawn any more
horsepower, as long

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.660
as you have an open
area in front of you,

00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:13.870
you will accelerate.

00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:18.220
And once you hit 45 or 55
knots, your hover power

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:19.840
turns into significant
excess power

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.980
that you can use for a climb.

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:24.610
So that's why you
often see helicopters

00:18:24.610 --> 00:18:29.870
at airports taking off kind of
like a short-field airplane,

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:33.220
and also landing a bit like
a short-field airplane.

00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:36.860
Straight and level, it's
very similar to an airplane.

00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.830
The performance is all a
function of the attitude

00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:41.450
that the aircraft is in.

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:47.030
Is it pitched up or down and
how much power is being applied?

00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.120
And that's an indirect function
of the collective position.

00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.170
So as with an
airplane, remember,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:56.300
your pitch controls your speed.

00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:57.800
And the amount of power--

00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.690
throttle in the airplane,
collective in the helicopter--

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:02.690
determines whether you're
climbing or descending

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.490
at that air speed.

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:08.630
Your attitude indicator in a
VFR helicopter is the horizon,

00:19:08.630 --> 00:19:10.970
so you're watching
the horizon carefully.

00:19:10.970 --> 00:19:14.138
The reason why people who
are instrument-rated airplane

00:19:14.138 --> 00:19:15.680
pilots, they jump
into the helicopter

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.830
and they can fly it immediately,
and people who've never flown

00:19:18.830 --> 00:19:19.680
have a tough time.

00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.325
It takes them 10 hours.

00:19:21.325 --> 00:19:22.700
And the reason is
that people who

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.620
are instrument-rated
airplane pilots,

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:26.360
they become very
sensitive to watching

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:31.510
for small changes in attitude.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:36.610
The anti-torque
pedals-- remember,

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.410
we had that tail
rotor, and we adjust it

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:42.820
so that the tail doesn't
spin around on the ground.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.835
In the air, we adjust it
so that the helicopter

00:19:45.835 --> 00:19:48.460
is streamlined into the wind.

00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:52.530
We don't actually have to
use them to make turns.

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:55.500
There's no adverse yaw
as in some airplanes,

00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.350
where it'll start skidding or--

00:19:58.350 --> 00:20:01.770
there's none of
that, or slipping.

00:20:01.770 --> 00:20:04.890
All we do to make a turn
is we put the helicopter,

00:20:04.890 --> 00:20:07.590
using the cyclic, into
a little bit of a bank.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.610
And then we wait.

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:12.020
So if we have, let's
say, a 10-degree bank,

00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:20.570
the helicopter in one minute
will make a 180-degree turn.

00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:24.630
Landing with power-- so
again, like an airplane,

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:27.050
if you see the
spot in the ground,

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.960
you adjust the power so
you don't overfly the spot

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:30.920
or underfly the spot.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.780
If the spot's rising
up in the windshield

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:34.910
from your perspective,
that means

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:37.130
you're going to land
short, so you add power,

00:20:37.130 --> 00:20:39.230
raise collective
in the helicopter.

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:44.090
If the spot is descending, then
you're overflying the spot,

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:45.680
so you have to reduce power.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:51.500
It's a purely visual
maneuver, except when

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:53.120
you're landing on a pinnacle.

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.900
And the reason for that is if
you're landing on a pinnacle,

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.540
you don't get a sensation
of your forward speed

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:01.250
from the ground rushing by.

00:21:01.250 --> 00:21:04.220
So the idea in the
helicopter is to land,

00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:05.570
unlike with the airplane.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:09.150
It's actually a little bit less
unnerving than an airplane.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:13.370
Some people get a little bit
ground-shy in the airplane.

00:21:13.370 --> 00:21:17.510
They're happy flying 80
knots in the pattern,

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:21.020
but they're not that
happy flying 70 knots

00:21:21.020 --> 00:21:23.330
10 feet above the runway,
which makes sense,

00:21:23.330 --> 00:21:26.000
because you don't want to slam
into the ground going really

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.020
fast.

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:30.080
The good news is
in the helicopter,

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.797
you never get to
that phase where

00:21:31.797 --> 00:21:33.380
you're going fast
close to the ground,

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.300
because when you're
landing, you just

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:40.713
say in my peripheral vision, how
fast is the ground rushing by?

00:21:40.713 --> 00:21:42.380
And you just kind of
keep that constant.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.870
Whatever it was up at 500
feet above the ground,

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:48.090
that's what you want when you're
five feet above the ground.

00:21:48.090 --> 00:21:49.828
And you'll very
naturally slow down.

00:21:49.828 --> 00:21:51.620
You'll do the right--
your natural instinct

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.530
to slow down as the
ground begins rushing

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.640
is a helpful one
in the helicopter.

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.780
So your peripheral vision
is used for speed reference,

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:05.300
and the spot moving up or down
is used for a descent rate

00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:06.650
reference.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.778
And that's why you never have
to look inside at the gauges,

00:22:10.778 --> 00:22:13.070
except when you're landing
on top of an office building

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:15.250
or something.

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.730
Can you land the
helicopter without power?

00:22:19.730 --> 00:22:21.167
It turns out the answer is yes.

00:22:21.167 --> 00:22:22.750
You have these three
buckets of energy

00:22:22.750 --> 00:22:25.270
that I alluded to earlier--

00:22:25.270 --> 00:22:28.540
kinetic from your forward
airspeed, potential

00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.260
from being up high, and then
another form of kinetic,

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.930
which we'll call "blade inertia"
from the relatively heavy

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.070
blades spinning.

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:40.300
So raise your hand if you
think the forward airspeed is

00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:43.930
number one in terms of size.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:45.320
Let's rank these.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.480
What's the biggest--
airspeed, a heavy helicopter

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.200
going 100 knots,
potential energy,

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:57.070
helicopter having been
lifted up off the ground,

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.720
or the blades whipping around
near the speed of sound?

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.770
Who votes for one,
forward airspeed?

00:23:04.770 --> 00:23:05.270
A few.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:08.390
Who votes for potential?

00:23:08.390 --> 00:23:09.020
A fair number.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.773
Who votes for blade inertia,
the blades whipping around?

00:23:11.773 --> 00:23:12.440
All right, good.

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.720
We've got a good distribution.

00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.920
Let me give you--

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:21.410
I'll tell you about, I think
it was a crazy French guy who

00:23:21.410 --> 00:23:25.510
got into what's now called
a Eurocopter, an Alouette,

00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:28.670
went up to 40,000 feet to
set an altitude record.

00:23:28.670 --> 00:23:30.800
The record was set when
the engines flamed out--

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:35.450
that's why it's 40,000 and
change, not 41,000 and change--

00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:38.940
and then auto-rotated all
the way down to the ground.

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:43.490
So whatever energy
bucket that was there

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.840
had to be sufficient to make
it all the way the ground.

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.020
So what does that tell
you the biggest one is?

00:23:48.020 --> 00:23:53.280
It's got to be something that
scales up to 40,000 feet.

00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:54.475
Potential, yeah.

00:23:54.475 --> 00:23:56.100
So potential energy
is a good candidate

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.440
for the biggest,
because again, you've

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:00.750
got to keep the rotors
spinning for longer if you're

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.757
auto-rotating from 10,000 feet
or 50,000 feet or wherever.

00:24:04.757 --> 00:24:06.840
I don't think that record's
been broken, actually.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.420
It was set in the '70s.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:12.780
So number two is the forward
airspeed of the helicopter.

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:15.810
The blade inertia isn't good
for much except for cushioning

00:24:15.810 --> 00:24:18.460
your fall from five or
10 feet above the ground.

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.470
So what you do in the helicopter
if the engine were to fail--

00:24:22.470 --> 00:24:24.210
number one reason
is fuel starvation

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.680
from failing to top it off.

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.910
Helicopters are often short on
payload, so people will say,

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:33.120
I want to take these
seven people somewhere,

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:35.660
and I'd be overweight
if I fill the fuel tank.

00:24:35.660 --> 00:24:39.877
So I'll put in half an hour of
fuel for this 15 minute trip.

00:24:39.877 --> 00:24:41.210
Actually, that would be illegal.

00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:42.630
20 minutes is the
minimum reserve.

00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.370
So I'll put in half an hour of
fuel for this 10 minute trip,

00:24:45.370 --> 00:24:50.060
and then there's a bit of a
delay, and you run out of fuel.

00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:52.890
There is a warning
light at 10 minutes.

00:24:52.890 --> 00:24:55.440
And the good news is you can
land in a field, a baseball

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:57.750
field, pretty easily.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:25:00.360
So the engine quits
for whatever reason.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.180
Let's say you run out of fuel.

00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:07.350
You want to get to 60 or 70
knots, some reasonable air

00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.895
speed.

00:25:07.895 --> 00:25:09.270
And then the
challenge is to hold

00:25:09.270 --> 00:25:11.740
that airspeed even as the
ground is rushing up at you.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:13.740
You hold it right till
you're at treetop height,

00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:15.450
about 40 feet above the ground.

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:18.750
Then you begin to flare, just
like in an airplane flaring

00:25:18.750 --> 00:25:19.860
for landing.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:22.330
You scrub off that
forward speed.

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:24.150
And that reduces
your descent rate.

00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:28.200
So you can reduce your
descent rate to zero

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.510
by bleeding off
all of that energy

00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:32.160
from the forward airspeed.

00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:34.770
And the kinetic energy,
remember, is mv squared.

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:35.770
So it's very important.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.170
There's twice as much energy at
70 knots compared to 50 knots.

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:42.450
So once you've scrubbed
off all your descent

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:46.317
rate and all your forward
speed, you're like this.

00:25:46.317 --> 00:25:47.650
So your tail is going to be low.

00:25:47.650 --> 00:25:49.608
And now you're going to
just fall to the ground

00:25:49.608 --> 00:25:50.620
and hit the tail first.

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.815
So it's not going to
be an FAA quality--

00:25:52.815 --> 00:25:54.690
you're going to walk
away, but it's not going

00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:56.680
to be an FAA-quality landing.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.620
So what you can do
is stick forward

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:04.270
and settle by pulling
up on the collective.

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.442
So you stick forward
to level the skids.

00:26:06.442 --> 00:26:08.650
And then when you're about
five feet above the ground

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.307
or maybe two feet
above the ground,

00:26:10.307 --> 00:26:11.890
you start pulling
up on the collective

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:14.470
to cushion your fall
that last few feet.

00:26:14.470 --> 00:26:16.480
So you've used up
potential energy

00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.220
keeping the blades windmilling.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:20.953
If you just flatten
the collective,

00:26:20.953 --> 00:26:22.870
the blades will have a
relatively normal angle

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:27.633
of attack to the air that's
now coming from below.

00:26:27.633 --> 00:26:29.050
You've kept up
your forward speed,

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:30.850
and you bleed that
off at the end

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:35.200
to reduce your vertical speed.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:38.054
And then finally, you go--

00:26:38.054 --> 00:26:41.036
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.613
The guy cheated.

00:27:06.613 --> 00:27:07.440
[END PLAYBACK]

00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.150
What's the cheat?

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:11.900
And I'm telling you the
cheat is you can hear it.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.030
You could hear the
cheating going on.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.710
He landed with zero
forward airspeed.

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:17.210
Why?

00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:22.240
What enabled that?

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.815
And like I said,
you could hear it.

00:27:24.815 --> 00:27:27.605
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:27.925 --> 00:27:30.050
PHILIP GREENSPUN: It's not
from the engine running.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.060
The engine was
presumably at idle.

00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:33.680
So what was the cheat?

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.542
Nobody heard?

00:27:34.542 --> 00:27:36.250
AUDIENCE: The wind
probably [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.360
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Wind, exactly, yes.

00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.256
What's your name?

00:27:39.256 --> 00:27:40.150
AUDIENCE: Messen.

00:27:40.150 --> 00:27:41.120
Messen.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.870
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Messen figured this out.

00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:45.050
So basically, he landed
with probably-- it's

00:27:45.050 --> 00:27:47.600
very hard to kill all
of your vertical speed

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.380
and all of your forward speed.

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.335
So if you go out and it's
15 knots down the runway,

00:27:52.335 --> 00:27:54.350
if you can just get
down to 15 knots,

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:57.440
and instead of sliding and going
[MAKES NOISE] down the runway,

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.010
which is common and not
harmful to the helicopter,

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.220
you'll have a perfect, what
looks like a perfect landing.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:04.970
It's very hard.

00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:07.700
In the big helicopters
like a Huey or something,

00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:11.958
it's practical to do a
zero/zero landing out of an auto

00:28:11.958 --> 00:28:12.500
all the time.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.142
In a Robinson, it can be tough,
but the wind helps hugely.

00:28:17.142 --> 00:28:19.100
And like I said, the
throttle was down at idle,

00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:20.892
so the engine is not
really doing anything.

00:28:20.892 --> 00:28:21.467
Question?

00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:23.300
AUDIENCE: The tail rotor
was still spinning.

00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.872
Is auto-rotating [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:25.872 --> 00:28:27.080
PHILIP GREENSPUN: It is, yes.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:27.997
Great, great question.

00:28:27.997 --> 00:28:32.060
So there's a sprag clutch,
which prevents the rotor system

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:38.910
from trying to drive the
engine, because that would

00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:42.240
introduce a lot more drag.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.955
But the main rotor
and the tail rotor

00:28:44.955 --> 00:28:48.330
are yoked together, so you
still have tail rotor control.

00:28:48.330 --> 00:28:48.960
Great question.

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:53.545
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
directional,

00:28:53.545 --> 00:28:56.290
because you don't really
need the torque anymore, so--

00:28:56.290 --> 00:28:58.123
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah,
you don't need much.

00:28:58.123 --> 00:29:00.050
I don't know.

00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:02.000
I'll have to think
about why it's useful.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:02.875
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:02.875 --> 00:29:04.917
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Yeah,
it's not useful for much.

00:29:04.917 --> 00:29:05.872
That's for sure.

00:29:05.872 --> 00:29:08.080
One thing that is good about
it is the hydraulic pump

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.680
is also geared to
the transmission.

00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.320
So you still have
hydraulic boost

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:13.755
even if you're auto-rotating
from super high.

00:29:13.755 --> 00:29:15.130
What can you do
with a helicopter

00:29:15.130 --> 00:29:16.630
if you have a private?

00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:21.010
You can visit schools.

00:29:21.010 --> 00:29:25.013
I visited the Winchester
Public Schools.

00:29:25.013 --> 00:29:26.680
I'm not sure you can
give them all rides

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.030
if you only have a private.

00:29:28.030 --> 00:29:29.488
There's some kind
of-- like I said,

00:29:29.488 --> 00:29:30.865
there's those
charity laws that--

00:29:30.865 --> 00:29:32.740
regulations that we
don't really worry about,

00:29:32.740 --> 00:29:34.780
because we have
commercial certificate

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.780
and a letter of authority
from the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.420
But here's one of the East
Coast Aero Club helicopters.

00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.730
I flew to the public
schools in Winchester.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:44.560
I gave all the kids rides.

00:29:44.560 --> 00:29:47.650
And when we flew over
houses like this,

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:51.940
I said, oh, that's just like
the house where I grew up.

00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.220
If you do that with kids
from Weston and Lincoln,

00:29:54.220 --> 00:29:55.110
they believe you.

00:29:55.110 --> 00:29:58.930
They don't parse that
as an ironic statement.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:01.450
Helicopter pilot careers,
just in case any of you guys

00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.800
are thinking about leaving the
desk where all the people work

00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:08.020
as a flight
instructor, fly tours

00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:10.540
in the Grand Canyon or
Alaska, and then they'll

00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:15.130
either go to offshore oil
or Medevac after that.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:19.360
Usually offshore oil
used to be easier to get.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:22.930
When oil prices are low,
when oil catches a cold,

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:25.715
the helicopter industry
catches the flu.

00:30:25.715 --> 00:30:28.090
They shut down these oil rigs
and there's a lot less need

00:30:28.090 --> 00:30:30.100
for helicopter transport.

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.200
Medevac is kind of
considered the plum job.

00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:34.300
That's my friend, Marcus.

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:35.800
He trained at East
Coast Aero Club

00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:41.050
and now he does 12-hour shifts
at a volunteer fire station.

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:45.340
And he gets paid
in North Carolina

00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:48.430
and goes hospital to hospital,
or sometimes picks people

00:30:48.430 --> 00:30:50.240
up off of highways and stuff.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.740
So what can you do?

00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:55.380
You can fly low and slow
both legally and safely.

00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.310
You saw there was a
carve-out for helicopters

00:30:57.310 --> 00:30:59.380
able to fly lower.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:04.290
One problematic aspect of flying
Piper Warriors and Cessnas

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:07.240
is that people--

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:09.970
their expectations of what an
aircraft is and what it can do

00:31:09.970 --> 00:31:12.730
has been set by their
airline experience.

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:14.590
And the first time you
try to get up and use

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:16.520
the bathroom in
your Piper, you'll

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:19.360
discover that JetBlue has some
advantages in the aircraft

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.220
department.

00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:21.970
And your passengers
will notice this, too.

00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:23.120
This is noisy.

00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.490
It's not climate controlled.

00:31:24.490 --> 00:31:26.830
There's no bathroom.

00:31:26.830 --> 00:31:28.990
The helicopters are awesome,
because people usually

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:30.400
haven't even been
in one, so it's

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:31.608
a whole different experience.

00:31:31.608 --> 00:31:33.370
There's a different view.

00:31:33.370 --> 00:31:36.310
You can take them on a 10-minute
ride from Hanscom Field

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.850
and go back.

00:31:36.850 --> 00:31:38.517
You don't have to
say, oh, let's go have

00:31:38.517 --> 00:31:39.730
lunch in Martha's Vineyard.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:40.930
You just take them
on a little tour

00:31:40.930 --> 00:31:42.388
and they say, wow,
this is awesome.

00:31:42.388 --> 00:31:45.960
So when I actually want to
show people what GA is like

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.500
and what my world
is like, I usually

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.270
take them for a helicopter ride.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.160
I don't take them for a trip.

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.790
The serious is for
transportation,

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:55.750
and the helicopter
is really what

00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.780
I think of as the
kind of aviation dream

00:31:58.780 --> 00:32:01.990
that people had
in ancient Greece.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:05.530
They didn't dream of
going to LA in six hours.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:10.570
They dreamed of
soaring like a bird.

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:12.172
You can land off-airport.

00:32:12.172 --> 00:32:13.630
That's where a lot
of the challenge

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.640
comes from the helicopter.

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:17.500
People think you're a
pilot of heroic skill

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.450
if you take off and
land at Hanscom.

00:32:19.450 --> 00:32:20.700
That's not very challenging.

00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.270
It's not really that different.

00:32:22.270 --> 00:32:25.960
And in some ways, it's easier
than taking off and landing

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.605
in a Piper or a Cessna.

00:32:28.605 --> 00:32:29.980
When you're
off-airport, you have

00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:33.490
to exercise a lot of
judgment, a lot of skill.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:35.770
And that's part
of your training.

00:32:35.770 --> 00:32:38.020
But it's also where
people get in trouble

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.270
hitting obstacles and stuff.

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:43.840
If you do get all of
your airplane skills,

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.600
you can transfer them over
to helicopters very easily.

00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:50.500
It's 30 hours minimum
of additional training

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:51.940
to add a helicopter rating.

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:54.200
40 is probably a
good budget number.

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:54.700
All right.

00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:57.730
Are there helicopter questions?

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:02.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:06.830
Can you just pick [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:07.630
OK, here it is.

00:33:07.630 --> 00:33:10.140
Or like, who's going to
tell you [INAUDIBLE]??

00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:12.462
PHILIP GREENSPUN: That
is a great question.

00:33:12.462 --> 00:33:13.920
Is there any
regulation about where

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:16.860
you can land your helicopter?

00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:23.010
The answer is until about 5 or
10 years ago, there wasn't any.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:25.380
So it was just permission
of the property owner

00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.690
and don't do anything
careless or reckless.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:33.510
So basically, the whole world
was open to helicopter pilots.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:36.570
There is a little bit of
a tweaking of the law.

00:33:36.570 --> 00:33:39.150
The FAA passed this--

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:40.980
they added this
regulation that I

00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.750
think was intended
for airplanes,

00:33:42.750 --> 00:33:46.472
but they forgot to carve it out.

00:33:46.472 --> 00:33:48.930
So they said if you make more
than 10 takeoffs and landings

00:33:48.930 --> 00:33:50.870
in the same place
in a year, then

00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.850
you have to get it approved as
an airport with a huge amount

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:55.120
of regulation.

00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:58.080
I think it was intended for
mining companies that would

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:59.835
set up their own landing strip.

00:33:59.835 --> 00:34:01.060
It doesn't really make sense.

00:34:01.060 --> 00:34:03.060
For helicopters, like if
you have a construction

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.220
site that you want to
regularly visit, now

00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:07.890
it's a bit of a hassle because
that 11th landing, in theory,

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:10.290
you need it to get
approval as an airport.

00:34:10.290 --> 00:34:12.870
But as a first
approximation, you

00:34:12.870 --> 00:34:15.000
can land anywhere
that the property

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.120
owner is happy to host you.

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.862
And towns, also.

00:34:20.862 --> 00:34:22.570
They're really aggressive
about harassing

00:34:22.570 --> 00:34:26.883
people who try to have a
helipad at their house now,

00:34:26.883 --> 00:34:27.800
just because they can.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.960
They get them under zoning
laws, even though they're not

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.752
really supposed to.

00:34:30.752 --> 00:34:32.929
The FAA is supposed to
have exclusive authority

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.580
to regulate aviation.

00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:36.949
Because think about
it-- there's all this--

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:39.590
there's so many levels
of government in the US.

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:43.405
If you let them all
just forbid activities,

00:34:43.405 --> 00:34:44.780
eventually there
would be nothing

00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:48.497
that was legal at all, because
people in Concord and Lexington

00:34:48.497 --> 00:34:50.830
would say, we don't want
airplanes flying over our head.

00:34:50.830 --> 00:34:56.400
So we'll just make it illegal
to fly a Gulfstream in Concord.

00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.750
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
from flying [INAUDIBLE]??

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:05.690
PHILIP GREENSPUN: I had
that in an earlier slide

00:35:05.690 --> 00:35:07.610
on learning to fly.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:10.710
The marginal cost
is about double.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:17.190
So it goes from 150 an
hour to 225, or 100 an hour

00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:21.360
to 200, because so many rotating
components get discarded

00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.210
after 2,200 hours--
so the transmissions,

00:35:24.210 --> 00:35:26.890
the blades, and so forth.

00:35:26.890 --> 00:35:29.410
So it is more
expensive per hour.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.040
However, like I also
said, the flights

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:33.330
tend to be a lot shorter.

00:35:33.330 --> 00:35:35.790
So I would say as a
hobby overall, it's

00:35:35.790 --> 00:35:38.760
about the same cost, because
you're not dragging people

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.752
all the way to the
Vineyard or Bar Harbor.

00:35:40.752 --> 00:35:42.210
You're just taking
them into Boston

00:35:42.210 --> 00:35:46.830
and back out, which is about
20 minutes of flight time

00:35:46.830 --> 00:35:51.110
and 30 minutes of
engine running time.

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:54.050
Whereas an intro airplane flight
would be an all day thing.

00:35:54.050 --> 00:35:56.910
You'd probably fly a couple
hours, two or three hours.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:01.210
So you actually probably
spend more with the airplane.

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:02.210
That's a great question.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:07.470
All right, so I guess we should
take a 10-minute restroom

00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:08.550
break.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:13.340
And after that, we're going to
hear from Laz about the F-22.

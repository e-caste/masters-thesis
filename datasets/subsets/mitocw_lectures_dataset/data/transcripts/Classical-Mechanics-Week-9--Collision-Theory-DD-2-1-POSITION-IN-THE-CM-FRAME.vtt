00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.910
We'd like to examine the
motion of two particles.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.270
Here's particle 1.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.710
And here's particle 2.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.620
And each particle
can have some motion.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.327
In between them is
the center of mass.

00:00:14.327 --> 00:00:15.910
And what we'd like
to do is figure out

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.580
how to describe the motion
of each of these particles

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.500
with respect to
the center of mass.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.870
So let's choose some
coordinate system.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.650
Origin down here.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.680
Here's our particle r1.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.540
Here's our particle r2.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.130
And here is our center of mass.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.940
Now in the reference frame
of the center of mass,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.800
we have position
vector r1 prime.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.907
And we have position
vector r2 prime.

00:00:39.907 --> 00:00:41.740
And what we'd like to
do is find expressions

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.500
for r2 prime and
r2 prime in terms

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.340
of the positions of r1 and r2.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.090
Now we call that the position of
the center of mass for this two

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:58.120
body problem is given by
m2 m1 r1 plus m2 r2 divided

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.160
by the total mass.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.590
And here we use
the vector triangle

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.130
that r1 prime equals r1
minus center of mass.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.910
Now remember this vector
is equal to this vector

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.800
minus that vector.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.150
Sometimes people like
to say the vector

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:19.300
r1 is equal to r plus r prime.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.590
And that's how we get
that relationship.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.940
Now we can use our
result here that r1 prime

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:35.110
is r1 minus m1 r1 plus m2
r2 divided by m1 plus m2.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.020
And when we combine
terms-- let's just do this

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.130
so you can see it-- r1
minus m1 r1 plus m2 r2

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.740
divided by the total mass.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.830
We now have the m1
r1 terms cancel.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:58.970
And we have a common m2 over
m1 plus m2 times r1 minus r2.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.520
Now r1 minus r2 is a vector
that goes from-- here is r1.

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.960
Here's r2.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.760
So the vector r1 minus r2
is the relative position

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.860
of vector 1 with respect to 2.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.400
And let's give that
a special name.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.040
We'll call that r1, 2, the
relative position vector.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:35.170
So we have m2 over m1
plus m2 r1, 2 is r1 prime.

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.079
Now you can easily see
that if you interchange

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:46.150
the indices 1 and 2, the
only thing that changes here

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.500
is a sign.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.500
And if we interchange 1 and
2-- and this is an exercise

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.440
that you can do--
then r2 prime is minus

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.420
m1-- I'm interchanging
the indices.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.260
The minus sign came from
the interchange of 1 and 2.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:11.020
And so we get m1 over m1 plus
m2 with the minus sign r1, 2.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.840
Now what is the
significance of this result?

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.079
If you know the
position of r1 and r2,

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.420
you know the relative velocity.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.540
If you have information
about this relative position,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.490
if you know the relative
position vector,

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.870
then you can separately get the
locations of the two objects

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.820
in the center of mass frame.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:34.780
Now this quantity in
here will appear often.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.210
And I'd like to introduce
a new quantity called

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.030
the reduced mass.

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.360
And that reduced mass,
mu, is the product

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.140
of m1 m2 over m1 plus m2.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.150
It's a simple exercise to see
that 1 over mu is 1 over m1

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.950
plus 1 over m2.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.860
And we'll encounter
that a little bit later.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.340
Then I can write both
of these vectors--

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.330
and this is our conclusion--
that r1 prime is the reduced

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.960
mass.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.880
Notice we have an m2 here, so
we have to divide by m1 times

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.830
the vector r1, 2.

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.250
And r2 prime is minus
the reduced mass.

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.329
Again, we now have
to divide by m2.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.540
And you see this nice symmetry
of m1 and 1, 2 and 2, r1, 2.

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.650
And that's our key result.

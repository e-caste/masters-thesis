00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.720 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: So
let's get started today.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.180 align:middle line:84%
First of all, are there any
questions from last time?

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:19.840 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.380 align:middle line:84%
Well, please feel free to
ask questions along the way.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:29.380 align:middle line:84%
In terms of the reading list,
we're up to lecture 9 today.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.540 align:middle line:90%
We're sharing with production.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.160 align:middle line:84%
It's our second lecture
on applications.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.280 align:middle line:90%
There are two starred papers.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.860 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
going through the first one

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.250 align:middle line:84%
with Samphantharak
in detail, and then

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.510 align:middle line:84%
a few selected slides on
the Kinnon et al paper.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.930 align:middle line:84%
But like all starred papers, I
hope you will be reading them,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.050 align:middle line:84%
because I know you're
very well trained now.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.630 align:middle line:84%
And you will be able
to read those articles.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.270 align:middle line:84%
So I think you would
get a lot out of it.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.960 align:middle line:84%
But we will cover
most of it today.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.500 align:middle line:84%
The other thing for
the study guide--

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.390 align:middle line:84%
so let me ask you
guys some questions.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.060 align:middle line:84%
Last time was our first applied
lecture on risk sharing.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.740 align:middle line:84%
We did it in both village
India and medieval villages.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.710 align:middle line:84%
And today, I want to give
a little bit more emphasis

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.000 align:middle line:84%
to the economics combined
with the analysis--

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.290 align:middle line:90%
more than I usually do.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:32.300 align:middle line:84%
But it seems like
the time to do that,

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.040 align:middle line:84%
since we're talking
about applications.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.940 align:middle line:90%
So the first one I picked here--

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.740 align:middle line:84%
describe in words why villages
in India are a risky place,

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.490 align:middle line:84%
how to quantify that
risk and its sources,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.810 align:middle line:84%
and how that risk might be
mitigated or potentially

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.410 align:middle line:84%
mitigated via individual
or social diversification.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:02.770 align:middle line:84%
So I have lately been
taking volunteers.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.550 align:middle line:90%
But let me ask.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.290 align:middle line:84%
Dexin, do you want to
take a stab at that?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.229 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.250 align:middle line:84%
So villages are a risky
place, because it's mostly

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:14.030 align:middle line:90%
agriculture.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.530 align:middle line:84%
And it's not a stable
source of income.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.720 align:middle line:84%
And I think we can quantify
that risk by just looking

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.640 align:middle line:84%
at the variation
through the years

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.820 align:middle line:84%
and how it really changes,
and how a lot of things

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.760 align:middle line:84%
are linked with each other
in terms of their risk.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.670 align:middle line:84%
And it can be
mitigated by planting

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.190 align:middle line:84%
different kinds of plants,
or planting far apart--

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.150 align:middle line:90%
that's individually.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.230 align:middle line:84%
And social diversification--
giving gifts or transfers.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.730 align:middle line:90%
Yeah.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.440 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Great.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.610 align:middle line:90%
Very, very good answer.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.180 align:middle line:90%
Thank you.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.410 align:middle line:84%
So we quantify the
risk by the coefficient

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:00.080 align:middle line:84%
of variation of a given crop or
a given crop in a certain soil

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.370 align:middle line:90%
type or a certain income source.

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.170 align:middle line:90%
Just to add a few more details--

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.090 align:middle line:90%
your answer was fine.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.240 align:middle line:84%
The covariance
across those things

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.113 align:middle line:84%
actually helps
mitigate the risk.

00:03:14.113 --> 00:03:15.530 align:middle line:84%
And that's what
you're saying when

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.750 align:middle line:84%
you said different crops or
different spots on the field.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.070 align:middle line:90%
Those are ex-ante.

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.930 align:middle line:84%
So there's individual
things that people can do.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.155 align:middle line:84%
And the ex-post-- social
diversification is the gifts.

00:03:30.155 --> 00:03:33.105 align:middle line:90%


00:03:33.105 --> 00:03:33.605 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:03:33.605 --> 00:03:36.780 align:middle line:90%


00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.380 align:middle line:90%
Next one.

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.140 align:middle line:84%
Comparing incomes over
households and time

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.290 align:middle line:84%
with consumption over
households and time,

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.260 align:middle line:84%
what can you infer
from the data alone?

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.640 align:middle line:84%
So let me stop there and
not read the second part.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.480 align:middle line:90%
Let's see.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.400 align:middle line:90%
Who would like to?

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.530 align:middle line:84%
Charles, do you want
to take a stab at that?

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.670 align:middle line:90%
Are you there?

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.560 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.640 align:middle line:90%
Let me think.

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.470 align:middle line:84%
If I remember correctly,
this is something

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.660 align:middle line:84%
like you can compare the
incomes, which is basically

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.650 align:middle line:84%
the crop harvest, and then
what you end up receiving.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.680 align:middle line:84%
And I remember, you
can infer from--

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.459 align:middle line:84%
you can see that it's
definitely much--

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:23.250 align:middle line:84%
you end up getting is much
flatter than what's produced.

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.750 align:middle line:84%
I guess I'm trying to answer
the second part of the question

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.250 align:middle line:90%
now.

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.040 align:middle line:84%
But that is data that suggests
that we're risk sharing.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:34.510 align:middle line:84%
I don't think that's
enough to prove causation,

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.987 align:middle line:90%
but it's definitely suggestive.

00:04:35.987 --> 00:04:37.445 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND:
Yeah, that's good.

00:04:37.445 --> 00:04:40.900 align:middle line:90%


00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.740 align:middle line:90%
Maybe the second sentence helps.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.080 align:middle line:84%
If average consumption
of households

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.520 align:middle line:84%
increased when average income
of households increased,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.010 align:middle line:84%
would that be consistent
with risk sharing or not?

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:58.240 align:middle line:90%


00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:59.150 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh, for me?

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.073 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, for you.

00:05:01.073 --> 00:05:01.740 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: So OK.

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.800 align:middle line:84%
So OK, average consumption
has to increase, but--

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:12.380 align:middle line:90%


00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.060 align:middle line:84%
I don't think it rolls out
to some sort of big sharing,

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:15.650 align:middle line:90%
I don't think.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.210 align:middle line:84%
Because I think you have to
parse a degree of risk sharing

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.940 align:middle line:84%
that wouldn't completely
annihilate everything.

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.010 align:middle line:84%
But I don't think
that would be enough.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.340 align:middle line:84%
I think that would still be
consistent with some level,

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.840 align:middle line:90%
right?

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.810 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah,
actually, the sentence

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.610 align:middle line:90%
is not terribly well worded.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.340 align:middle line:90%
But it is worthwhile to clarify.

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.810 align:middle line:84%
So the first part
that we looked at

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:45.040 align:middle line:84%
is just the levels of stuff
over households and over time.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.290 align:middle line:84%
We referred to the
Rocky Mountain picture

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:52.390 align:middle line:84%
as incomes going up
concealing the valley behind,

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.950 align:middle line:84%
and very, very
jagged rocky pictures

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.580 align:middle line:84%
as opposed to consumption,
which was very flat.

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.600 align:middle line:84%
And we were even joking
around a bit-- very boring,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.500 align:middle line:90%
as in Kansas.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
So then, the issue
would be with the theory

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.230 align:middle line:90%
that we're about to look at.

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:13.960 align:middle line:84%
Apart from the data
alone, would you

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.970 align:middle line:84%
think household
consumption ought

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.320 align:middle line:90%
to move with household income?

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:19.570 align:middle line:84%
Actually, I think
there's a question below.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.450 align:middle line:84%
And what's ambiguous
about that sentence is,

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:26.920 align:middle line:84%
household consumption is
increased with average income

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.800 align:middle line:90%
of households.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.960 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, that's very
treacherously worded.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:35.170 align:middle line:84%
Average income meaning
overall the dates

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.150 align:middle line:90%
of a given household--

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.220 align:middle line:90%
that sets the levels of things.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:45.070 align:middle line:84%
And maybe the household with
higher average income over time

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:48.410 align:middle line:84%
has a higher average
consumption over time.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.300 align:middle line:90%
And I'll ask for volunteers.

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.670 align:middle line:84%
If we have this regression where
we run household consumption,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.160 align:middle line:84%
on the left, as the
dependent variable

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.550 align:middle line:84%
onto aggregate consumption
and individual income,

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:06.150 align:middle line:84%
on the right, throwing
in some intercepts-- so

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:08.040 align:middle line:84%
what restrictions
from the theory

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:13.620 align:middle line:84%
are placed on the coefficient
of individual income?

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.610 align:middle line:84%
And I'll take a
volunteer for that.

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.510 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: I think the
coefficient individual income

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:21.915 align:middle line:90%
should be 0, right?

00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:22.790 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:24.620 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Because
it's just related

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:32.870 align:middle line:84%
to the aggregate in average
income of the household.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:35.060 align:middle line:90%
And I have a question here.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.850 align:middle line:84%
It's that I remember
in the slides--

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:42.560 align:middle line:84%
saying that when all the
households have the same risk

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:52.130 align:middle line:84%
aversion, then the coefficient
between the aggregate

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:56.570 align:middle line:90%
consumption should be 1.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:57.740 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yes.

00:07:57.740 --> 00:08:00.140 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: But why?

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:06.710 align:middle line:84%
I think the coefficient
on the average consumption

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:11.395 align:middle line:84%
should be when not the
aggregate consumption.

00:08:11.395 --> 00:08:13.020 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Oh,
well there's, say,

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:14.350 align:middle line:90%
a fixed number of households.

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:17.640 align:middle line:84%
So taking the
aggregate and dividing

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:22.620 align:middle line:84%
by the number of households
gives you the average.

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.848 align:middle line:84%
It's just a renormalization
of the units, that's all.

00:08:26.848 --> 00:08:27.390 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:29.432 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: But you're
right that it's meant

00:08:29.432 --> 00:08:30.960 align:middle line:90%
to represent the aggregate.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.270 align:middle line:90%


00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.740 align:middle line:90%
So you can think of it that way.

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.309 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:38.900 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Because the
economics makes more sense.

00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.890 align:middle line:84%
The aggregate is
going up, coming up

00:08:42.890 --> 00:08:45.910 align:middle line:90%
over all the individuals.

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:50.710 align:middle line:84%
And if there's constant absolute
risk aversion and the same risk

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.620 align:middle line:84%
aversion for all the
households, then whenever

00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:56.200 align:middle line:84%
the aggregate goes up,
every individual household

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.660 align:middle line:90%
consumption goes up 1 to 1.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.433 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:01.100 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Which
is what you said.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:01.930 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:03.380 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:04.297 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:09:04.297 --> 00:09:10.270 align:middle line:84%
And the emphasis here is the
household-specific income.

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.100 align:middle line:90%
It has a coefficient of 0.

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.390 align:middle line:84%
That's the salient
restriction that the theory

00:09:16.390 --> 00:09:19.325 align:middle line:90%
places on the data as well.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.890 align:middle line:90%


00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:27.140 align:middle line:84%
And then finally, we looked
at the division of land

00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:30.560 align:middle line:90%
in these medieval village.

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.710 align:middle line:84%
And the question
is, would scattering

00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:38.460 align:middle line:84%
of an individual
household's plots

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:42.510 align:middle line:84%
across the different
fields be enough to achieve

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.600 align:middle line:84%
an optimal allocation
of risk sharing?

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.705 align:middle line:84%
Paolo, do you want to
take a crack at that?

00:09:49.705 --> 00:09:50.330 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:54.020 align:middle line:84%
I think the answer is no, just
because it's not necessarily

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:59.900 align:middle line:84%
that each field
is a random draw.

00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:02.240 align:middle line:84%
You can have correlations
like, it's just a drought here

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.530 align:middle line:90%
and there's no rain anywhere.

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:06.800 align:middle line:84%
That's a risk, which would be
a shock to all of your crops,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.370 align:middle line:90%
essentially.

00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:11.870 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:15.950 align:middle line:84%
So it's correct that it's
not necessarily enough,

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:19.830 align:middle line:84%
unless you have very
special characteristics

00:10:19.830 --> 00:10:21.600 align:middle line:90%
of those plots--

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.900 align:middle line:90%


00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:28.140 align:middle line:84%
how they move with various
states of the world.

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.820 align:middle line:84%
In the lecture, we
gave an example--

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.870 align:middle line:90%


00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:37.100 align:middle line:84%
two examples, really--
one where there

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:43.670 align:middle line:84%
are two types of land
and both are increasing

00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:44.885 align:middle line:90%
as the states increase.

00:10:44.885 --> 00:10:48.320 align:middle line:90%


00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:55.100 align:middle line:84%
And then, it would be enough
to have each household have

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.480 align:middle line:84%
a share, a constant share
over the two types of land.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.420 align:middle line:84%
That would result in a
linear risk sharing schedule.

00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:06.570 align:middle line:84%
So for certain
utility functions,

00:11:06.570 --> 00:11:10.580 align:middle line:84%
including an examination of
the slope and the intercepts,

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.740 align:middle line:90%
that would be enough.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.710 align:middle line:84%
So in special cases,
it might work.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:20.150 align:middle line:84%
But in general, you have
two different types of land.

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:21.650 align:middle line:90%
And the output goes up in one.

00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:23.450 align:middle line:84%
It may go down in
the other, depending

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:28.220 align:middle line:84%
on the state of the world,
in which case, handing out

00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:35.370 align:middle line:84%
shares of each type is not
going to work, necessarily.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.000 align:middle line:84%
And we explore that
further in the lecture.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.270 align:middle line:84%
So that whole lecture
culminated at the end

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:47.070 align:middle line:84%
with an example where we
had more states of the world

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:51.480 align:middle line:84%
than we had land types
and restricted them

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:57.560 align:middle line:84%
to having shares of each type
as if they could not transfer

00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:58.430 align:middle line:90%
stuff around.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:03.740 align:middle line:84%
And it was clear that it
was constrained optimal.

00:12:03.740 --> 00:12:07.220 align:middle line:84%
Taking that allocation of land
with the harvest as given,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:09.920 align:middle line:84%
we could do better
by, add to welfare

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.590 align:middle line:84%
by having exposed redistribution
of the grain via transfers.

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:16.100 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:12:16.100 --> 00:12:19.030 align:middle line:84%
So that's probably
enough of a review.

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:21.530 align:middle line:84%
As always, there are many more
questions in the study guide.

00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:23.300 align:middle line:84%
And probably, spend
quite a lot of time

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.270 align:middle line:84%
just deciding which
ones to ask in class.

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:28.980 align:middle line:90%
You should look at all of them.

00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:34.910 align:middle line:84%
And let's get to lecture 9,
is what we're doing today.

00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:37.550 align:middle line:84%
And this is risk
sharing with production.

00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:39.740 align:middle line:90%
Three main topics, really.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.560 align:middle line:84%
Risk and return in
production-- and that part

00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.110 align:middle line:84%
is continuation of
some of the themes,

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:48.290 align:middle line:84%
although we didn't really
put all the pieces together.

00:12:48.290 --> 00:12:50.900 align:middle line:84%
We had production in
the dynamics lecture.

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.100 align:middle line:84%
We had risk as in yields
coming from land plots.

00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.310 align:middle line:84%
But we never talked about
inputs into land plots,

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:00.570 align:middle line:84%
and associated
outputs, and so on.

00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.140 align:middle line:84%
So we'll put those
two pieces together.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:05.360 align:middle line:84%
Another feature
of this lecture is

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:08.540 align:middle line:84%
that we're going to use
data on production but also

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:09.930 align:middle line:90%
on consumption.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:12.060 align:middle line:90%
So both things will be there.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.680 align:middle line:84%
And this is illustrative of
how powerful this risk sharing

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:16.880 align:middle line:90%
framework is.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:20.030 align:middle line:84%
It extends to more and more
complicated situations.

00:13:20.030 --> 00:13:22.080 align:middle line:84%
We're able to do more
and more with it.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.230 align:middle line:84%
And finally, I have
some words at the end

00:13:24.230 --> 00:13:27.560 align:middle line:84%
about social networks
and sharing risk,

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.460 align:middle line:84%
and in particular, an
example that will remind you

00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:34.220 align:middle line:84%
for better or worse
of COVID, and what's

00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:38.610 align:middle line:84%
going on when people get
sick with the economics.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:42.290 align:middle line:84%
So this first starred
paper on the reading list

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.750 align:middle line:90%
with Krislert Samphantharak.

00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:46.880 align:middle line:84%
It'll tie, if you
haven't guessed,

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.380 align:middle line:84%
extensions of the theory
project selection.

00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:54.050 align:middle line:84%
So we studied a model with risk
and return in productive assets

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:57.390 align:middle line:84%
in developing economies--
namely, Thailand.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:14:00.650 align:middle line:84%
We're going to measure
idiosyncratic and aggregate

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:01.430 align:middle line:90%
risk premia.

00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:03.650 align:middle line:84%
Those words probably don't
make a whole lot of sense,

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:07.820 align:middle line:84%
although we've been talking
about related things just now

00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:10.910 align:middle line:84%
with the risk sharing
regression, idiosyncratic

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:13.850 align:middle line:84%
being household-specific
income, and aggregate

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:16.040 align:middle line:90%
being aggregate consumption.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.940 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to be
able to quantify those two

00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:24.230 align:middle line:84%
different premia and analyze
what households are doing,

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.730 align:middle line:90%
how exposed they are to risk.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:28.940 align:middle line:84%
And finally, in
principle, one could

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:31.910 align:middle line:84%
take not just the
straight-out returns,

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:34.640 align:middle line:84%
but risk-adjusted
returns and look

00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.120 align:middle line:84%
for patterns across households,
like whether poor households

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:41.090 align:middle line:84%
are more vulnerable
or less vulnerable,

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:43.590 align:middle line:84%
does education
matter, and so on.

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:45.110 align:middle line:90%
So here's the model.

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:49.730 align:middle line:84%
There are capital J
households indexed by j,

00:14:49.730 --> 00:14:51.620 align:middle line:90%
little j for an individual.

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:53.210 align:middle line:84%
J is the number
for the aggregate.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:84%
There are I production
activities, little i, big I.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.210 align:middle line:84%
And you can think of those
production activities

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:03.350 align:middle line:84%
as production sets or
production technologies.

00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:05.630 align:middle line:90%
The inputs are capital.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:08.210 align:middle line:84%
And I'll say some
words a bit later

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:13.070 align:middle line:84%
about where labor and materials
and seed and other things went.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:15.200 align:middle line:84%
But for now, just
think of there being

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.840 align:middle line:90%
a single input called capital.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:22.130 align:middle line:84%
And the outputs are in the same
units of a single consumption

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:23.060 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:26.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to be looking
at a household running

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:29.130 align:middle line:90%
a portfolio of assets.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:33.410 align:middle line:84%
Now, actually, the way you
think about this in finance

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:36.680 align:middle line:84%
is, you want to engage
in a certain activity.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.120 align:middle line:84%
You acquire the assets
necessary to do that activity.

00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And a household could be doing
one or multiple activities.

00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.250 align:middle line:90%
This will generate a return.

00:15:47.250 --> 00:15:50.000 align:middle line:84%
So we want to know how
well the project is doing

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:52.160 align:middle line:84%
and whether it was
selected properly.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.710 align:middle line:84%
So you want to compare
the rate of return

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.130 align:middle line:84%
to the best alternative
use of funds

00:15:59.130 --> 00:16:01.200 align:middle line:84%
except that here, we're
going to put risk in.

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:04.230 align:middle line:84%
So it makes it much
more interesting.

00:16:04.230 --> 00:16:08.100 align:middle line:84%
In particular, these set
returns are stochastic.

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.340 align:middle line:84%
And they can be
correlated over activities

00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:14.340 align:middle line:90%
and correlated over households.

00:16:14.340 --> 00:16:17.310 align:middle line:84%
So again, you can think
about the previous lecture

00:16:17.310 --> 00:16:19.020 align:middle line:84%
with village India,
although this

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.200 align:middle line:84%
happens to be village Thailand
and its different kinds

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.660 align:middle line:84%
of crops and different
soils, different income

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:26.650 align:middle line:90%
sources, and so on.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:30.115 align:middle line:84%
So I mentioned early
on in lecture 1

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:31.740 align:middle line:84%
that we were going
to go back and forth

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:38.340 align:middle line:84%
between actual real agrarian
economies and associated

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:39.600 align:middle line:90%
metaphors.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.400 align:middle line:84%
So we can talk about trees
bearing fruit literally

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.180 align:middle line:90%
in the data.

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:47.280 align:middle line:84%
But we can also
talk about a tree

00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.070 align:middle line:84%
as an asset in financial
markets, households'

00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.510 align:middle line:90%
whole assets.

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:52.830 align:middle line:90%
And they pay dividends.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:55.360 align:middle line:84%
And there may be correlations
in stock returns.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.770 align:middle line:84%
So exactly the same
theory is being applied

00:16:58.770 --> 00:17:00.910 align:middle line:90%
to two very different settings.

00:17:00.910 --> 00:17:04.349 align:middle line:84%
And in fact, we're reverse
engineering in this paper.

00:17:04.349 --> 00:17:08.640 align:middle line:84%
We're taking measures of risk
reduction and risk premia that

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:12.569 align:middle line:84%
have been applied to stocks
in the New York Stock Exchange

00:17:12.569 --> 00:17:15.599 align:middle line:84%
and applying it to
all these activities

00:17:15.599 --> 00:17:20.369 align:middle line:84%
across various households
in a typical Thai village.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:20.910 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:22.710 align:middle line:84%
So a little bit
more in notation.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.950 align:middle line:84%
We have F production
function for activity

00:17:25.950 --> 00:17:30.420 align:middle line:84%
I run by household J. And
it has as a single input

00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.560 align:middle line:84%
the level at which
it's capitalized,

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.180 align:middle line:84%
the capital input in activity
I run by household J.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:40.020 align:middle line:84%
So we can sum overall activities
and sum overall households

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:42.790 align:middle line:84%
and get an aggregate
production function.

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:46.230 align:middle line:84%
So again, early on in one of
those lectures on production,

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.800 align:middle line:84%
we talked about aggregating
two example production

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.540 align:middle line:90%
sets into one.

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.370 align:middle line:90%
So this is a version of that.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.870 align:middle line:84%
So the economy starts out
with an aggregate amount

00:17:57.870 --> 00:18:01.720 align:middle line:84%
of wealth, which is
coming from two sources.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.670 align:middle line:84%
One, the trees,
and two, the fruit.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:10.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, let me just say that as
is standard in a lot-- not all,

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.340 align:middle line:84%
but a lot-- of
economic models, we're

00:18:12.340 --> 00:18:15.480 align:middle line:84%
going to have what we call a
putty putty, meaning that you

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.740 align:middle line:84%
take the putty in terms of very
malleable consumption, what

00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:23.280 align:middle line:84%
could be consumption, and
invest it into capital.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.140 align:middle line:90%
And then, that yields a return.

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.530 align:middle line:84%
You can certainly eat the fruit,
but you can also eat the tree.

00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:33.030 align:middle line:84%
So the putty putty part
comes from undoing the tree.

00:18:33.030 --> 00:18:35.400 align:middle line:84%
Of course, in many
actual situations,

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.260 align:middle line:90%
you can't eat the machine.

00:18:37.260 --> 00:18:39.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's as if you
could sell the machine

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.640 align:middle line:84%
and get the
consumption equivalent.

00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.040 align:middle line:84%
If you wanted to eat
all of it, you could.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:47.070 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that right
now in the notation.

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.520 align:middle line:84%
We're going to have, quote
unquote, "a social planner."

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:52.830 align:middle line:84%
But of course, you
know now, that just

00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:55.110 align:middle line:84%
means that we're going
to have these programming

00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:58.570 align:middle line:84%
problems for the determination
of Pareto optimal allocation.

00:18:58.570 --> 00:19:01.020 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to act as
if the planner is doing it.

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:03.600 align:middle line:84%
But it's really a
math problem that we

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.660 align:middle line:84%
can solve to go back and forth
between solutions to the math

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:11.430 align:middle line:84%
problem and various Pareto
optimal allocations.

00:19:11.430 --> 00:19:15.810 align:middle line:84%
So consumption of household
J at a given moment--

00:19:15.810 --> 00:19:20.700 align:middle line:84%
say a year-- the sources
of potential consumption

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:25.410 align:middle line:84%
would be the fruit, how
much activity I is yielding

00:19:25.410 --> 00:19:29.040 align:middle line:84%
a fruit run by household J
as a function of previously

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.640 align:middle line:90%
determined capitalization KIJ.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.490 align:middle line:84%
We sum overall I. And
we have the tree itself,

00:19:36.490 --> 00:19:39.330 align:middle line:84%
which as I've said now
could be potentially eaten.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:42.460 align:middle line:84%
But from these
available resources,

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.710 align:middle line:84%
we can subtract off the
capitalization for next period.

00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:49.620 align:middle line:84%
Prime means tomorrow
or next year.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:54.750 align:middle line:84%
And KIJ is the level of capital
carried out from this year

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:56.260 align:middle line:90%
into next year.

00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.720 align:middle line:84%
So this is like storage in
that dynamic medieval village

00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.000 align:middle line:90%
economy.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.320 align:middle line:90%
That's one activity.

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.760 align:middle line:84%
Seed planted in the ground
is another type of activity.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.310 align:middle line:90%
This is a generalization.

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:14.670 align:middle line:84%
And finally, we have
these transfers, tau.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:17.610 align:middle line:84%
These are going to be, among
other things, key control

00:20:17.610 --> 00:20:19.890 align:middle line:84%
variables of the
so-called planner,

00:20:19.890 --> 00:20:23.010 align:middle line:84%
adding potentially to the
resources of the household,

00:20:23.010 --> 00:20:26.790 align:middle line:90%
or if negative, taking away.

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:29.490 align:middle line:84%
So then, we come to
this programming problem

00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:34.800 align:middle line:84%
for the determination of
Pareto optimal allocations.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.890 align:middle line:84%
And despite some heavy
looking notation,

00:20:37.890 --> 00:20:40.590 align:middle line:84%
you'll probably understand
this pretty readily.

00:20:40.590 --> 00:20:44.550 align:middle line:84%
First of all, here's the
utility function of household J.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:49.140 align:middle line:84%
And all the slide does is stick
into what would be consumption.

00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:51.540 align:middle line:84%
The consumption is
defined at the bottom

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.100 align:middle line:90%
of the previous slide--

00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.400 align:middle line:84%
resources available
minus resources

00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.930 align:middle line:84%
utilized for next period
year plus the transfer.

00:21:00.930 --> 00:21:02.910 align:middle line:84%
These lambdas are
the Pareto weights

00:21:02.910 --> 00:21:07.920 align:middle line:84%
for maximizing a lambda-weighted
sum of utilities today.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.530 align:middle line:84%
And the control
variables for the planner

00:21:10.530 --> 00:21:13.170 align:middle line:84%
are these transfers,
as I've already said,

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:17.020 align:middle line:84%
plus the level of capitalization
of all the projects.

00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.570 align:middle line:84%
So we're trying to find an
optimal allocation of capital

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:26.040 align:middle line:84%
as well as an optimal
allocation of the transfers.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:30.810 align:middle line:84%
Small apology-- this
apostrophe-looking object

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:33.430 align:middle line:84%
shouldn't be there
on top of the taus.

00:21:33.430 --> 00:21:37.480 align:middle line:84%
It's not a prime, because the
transfers are decided today,

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.060 align:middle line:90%
not next period.

00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.150 align:middle line:84%
But there's definitely
a prime on this capital,

00:21:42.150 --> 00:21:45.540 align:middle line:84%
because the current state has
already given the projects

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.400 align:middle line:90%
with their capitalizations.

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.060 align:middle line:84%
The thing to be decided
upon is how much capital

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.970 align:middle line:84%
you want to invest in all
the various possible projects

00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:55.830 align:middle line:90%
for tomorrow.

00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:58.860 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Is it is it better
to add a depreciation here?

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:05.230 align:middle line:84%
Because if instead of a tree,
if you think of a machine?

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.300 align:middle line:90%
It will definitely depreciate.

00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.560 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah, it's
loaded into this output.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.300 align:middle line:90%
And you'll see this in the data.

00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.570 align:middle line:84%
You take net profits
but you subtract off

00:22:16.570 --> 00:22:19.180 align:middle line:90%
as an expense the depreciation.

00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:21.700 align:middle line:84%
But it's true it's
not there explicitly,

00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:23.590 align:middle line:90%
but that's where it is.

00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:27.280 align:middle line:84%
So yeah, it should be
and it is included, OK?

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:28.240 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.657 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Now the other
thing that makes this thing

00:22:30.657 --> 00:22:33.340 align:middle line:84%
complicated-- but again, you're
already tooled up to get this

00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.360 align:middle line:90%
right away--

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:37.930 align:middle line:90%
these are these value functions.

00:22:37.930 --> 00:22:41.140 align:middle line:84%
So what is the state
of the world today?

00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.950 align:middle line:84%
It's total wealth that's
available at the bottom

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:47.950 align:middle line:84%
of the slide summing over all
activities and households,

00:22:47.950 --> 00:22:49.630 align:middle line:90%
all fruit and all trees.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:53.950 align:middle line:84%
This capital lambda is just
the individual Pareto weights.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:56.350 align:middle line:90%
And they're fixed for all time.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:59.320 align:middle line:84%
And then, you decide on
these control variables

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.480 align:middle line:84%
how much to eat and
how much to save

00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.190 align:middle line:90%
in the various technologies.

00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.260 align:middle line:84%
That's going to deliver
a state for tomorrow,

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.190 align:middle line:90%
which is wealth tomorrow.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:11.410 align:middle line:90%
It would be W prime.

00:23:11.410 --> 00:23:16.040 align:middle line:84%
Just like W is this period, W
prime would be for next period.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.210 align:middle line:84%
And you would have a prime
on all of these objects.

00:23:19.210 --> 00:23:22.450 align:middle line:84%
You'd have the fruit in the
trees next period at prime.

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.920 align:middle line:90%
That's the W prime.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:27.580 align:middle line:84%
This value function
is as if they lived

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:30.040 align:middle line:90%
in an infinite horizon economy.

00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.090 align:middle line:84%
They're discounting
next period by this fee.

00:23:34.090 --> 00:23:35.200 align:middle line:90%
Usually, we use beta.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.260 align:middle line:84%
But beta in this lecture is
reserved for something else,

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:39.920 align:middle line:90%
like a regression coefficient.

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.380 align:middle line:84%
So fee is the common discount
rate across all the households.

00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:46.750 align:middle line:84%
And you remember how
we got these Vs, right?

00:23:46.750 --> 00:23:49.120 align:middle line:84%
We had a slide at the
end of one of the--

00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.340 align:middle line:90%
at the dynamic lecture.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.390 align:middle line:90%
Act like it's a finite period.

00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:57.100 align:middle line:84%
So for the optimum, which would
be, don't fund everything,

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.480 align:middle line:90%
eat everything in sight.

00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:00.910 align:middle line:84%
And then, go to the next
to last period and third

00:24:00.910 --> 00:24:02.210 align:middle line:90%
to last period.

00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.630 align:middle line:84%
And then, keep
iterating as far back

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.680 align:middle line:90%
into the present as possible.

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:10.840 align:middle line:84%
And this value function,
which would have a T on it

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.070 align:middle line:84%
for the length of horizon,
will go to something stable,

00:24:15.070 --> 00:24:18.140 align:middle line:84%
as if we had solved the
infinite horizon problem.

00:24:18.140 --> 00:24:20.410 align:middle line:84%
So that's all loaded
up in here, too.

00:24:20.410 --> 00:24:23.660 align:middle line:90%
Questions about this slide?

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:25.790 align:middle line:90%
Oh, one last thing.

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:29.480 align:middle line:84%
You can't put negative
capital into the ground.

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.910 align:middle line:84%
Capital could be
0, in which case

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.740 align:middle line:90%
you're not doing that activity.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:37.520 align:middle line:84%
Or it's positive, in which case
you are doing the activity.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:42.020 align:middle line:84%
This is true over all projects
I in all households J.

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:45.470 align:middle line:84%
You can set that thing up as
a Lagrangian with the shadow

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.980 align:middle line:90%
prices and solve.

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.690 align:middle line:84%
And you'll get a
familiar condition.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.520 align:middle line:84%
If you differentiate
with respect

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.840 align:middle line:84%
to consumptions or the
transfers, for that matter,

00:24:56.840 --> 00:25:00.410 align:middle line:84%
you will get that these lambda
weighted margin utilities

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:03.140 align:middle line:84%
should be the same
over all households

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.020 align:middle line:84%
and equal to a common
Lagrange multiplier

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.410 align:middle line:84%
on the current
resource constraint mu.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.570 align:middle line:84%
So you've actually
seen this before.

00:25:11.570 --> 00:25:15.350 align:middle line:84%
It's exactly equal to what
we had before in village

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:18.770 align:middle line:84%
India without consideration
of production.

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.420 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to
get something else.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.180 align:middle line:84%
Namely, when we look
at the control variable

00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:26.090 align:middle line:84%
the capital control
variables, we're

00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:29.900 align:middle line:84%
going to get something that
links marginal utility today

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.320 align:middle line:84%
to effectively to marginal
utility next period.

00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.600 align:middle line:84%
And that is that
the lambda weighted

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:39.320 align:middle line:84%
marginal utility of consumption
today for household J--

00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:41.390 align:middle line:90%
if this were set equal--

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:44.330 align:middle line:84%
should be equal to the
future margin utility.

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, if you take a
unit of resource today

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.330 align:middle line:84%
infinitesimally small,
and instead of eating it

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.610 align:middle line:84%
you invest it, what
you'll get tomorrow

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:54.590 align:middle line:84%
would be the derivative
off the production

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.120 align:middle line:90%
function of that investment.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.690 align:middle line:84%
Plus you get the tree
back, that one unit back.

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:03.560 align:middle line:84%
And that return stream
is going to be evaluated

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:05.730 align:middle line:84%
at the marginal
utility of wealth,

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:09.530 align:middle line:84%
which is the derivative of this
value function at tomorrow's

00:26:09.530 --> 00:26:10.200 align:middle line:90%
wealth.

00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.170 align:middle line:84%
So again, we're just
taking a derivative

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:14.930 align:middle line:90%
of this right-hand side term.

00:26:14.930 --> 00:26:16.040 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:18.470 align:middle line:84%
So it's written as
a weak inequality.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:19.850 align:middle line:90%
It could be less than 0.

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:22.610 align:middle line:84%
If it's less than 0, let's
take the margin utility

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:25.190 align:middle line:84%
of consumption today,
which is minus,

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.520 align:middle line:84%
and on the left-hand side,
put it on the right-hand side.

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.590 align:middle line:84%
And that would say, the
weighted margin utility

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:35.850 align:middle line:84%
of consumption today is strictly
greater than the margin utility

00:26:35.850 --> 00:26:37.375 align:middle line:90%
you would get tomorrow.

00:26:37.375 --> 00:26:38.750 align:middle line:84%
So they're going
to hit a corner.

00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:42.320 align:middle line:84%
They would like, actually, the
capital level to go negative,

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.480 align:middle line:84%
because they're
desperate to eat today.

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.090 align:middle line:84%
The marginal utility
return today is higher

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:49.310 align:middle line:90%
than it will be next period.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:50.840 align:middle line:84%
But of course,
we're not allowing

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:55.580 align:middle line:84%
them to go negative,
hence the inequality.

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.310 align:middle line:84%
To remind you in other
contexts, we write out

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:59.780 align:middle line:90%
the full Lagrangian program.

00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:01.790 align:middle line:84%
We put an extra
Lagrange multiplier

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:03.830 align:middle line:84%
on these non-negativity
constraints.

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:06.350 align:middle line:84%
Then this whole thing
would be at an equality.

00:27:06.350 --> 00:27:09.380 align:middle line:84%
But it would have as well
the potentially positive

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:11.400 align:middle line:90%
Lagrange multiplier.

00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:15.450 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the conclusion is, not
all activities need be funded.

00:27:15.450 --> 00:27:18.600 align:middle line:84%
You might actually want to
unfund them and draw resources

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.190 align:middle line:90%
out of them that aren't there.

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.460 align:middle line:90%
You can't do that.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.520 align:middle line:90%
So you set them equal to 0.

00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:26.220 align:middle line:84%
Others get funded
at a positive level.

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.130 align:middle line:84%
We will be focusing
a lot on these set

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:33.240 align:middle line:84%
of activities over households
for which this is equal to 0.

00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.570 align:middle line:90%
And those are funded projects.

00:27:35.570 --> 00:27:39.400 align:middle line:84%
OK, so it looks like this
is entirely closed economy.

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:41.490 align:middle line:84%
But as I said, these
techniques generalize.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:45.450 align:middle line:84%
So we can think of a village
as a small open economy.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:47.970 align:middle line:84%
And maybe they can
go to an outside bank

00:27:47.970 --> 00:27:50.220 align:middle line:84%
and borrow money,
in which case we'd

00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:53.490 align:middle line:84%
have to change the wealth
variable to subtract off

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:55.890 align:middle line:84%
the principal and interest
that's coming due today,

00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:59.610 align:middle line:84%
but add in the debt that
they enter into today.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.440 align:middle line:84%
That will come due
the next period.

00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.580 align:middle line:90%
Nothing changes.

00:28:02.580 --> 00:28:04.920 align:middle line:84%
These first order
conditions don't change.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.680 align:middle line:84%
Oh, it's good for them
in terms of smoothing.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.650 align:middle line:84%
If the village wealth is
low, the village as a whole

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:11.850 align:middle line:90%
might want to borrow.

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:13.110 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:15.690 align:middle line:84%
So the quantitative
solution can change,

00:28:15.690 --> 00:28:18.630 align:middle line:84%
but our characterization in
terms of these first order

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:20.800 align:middle line:90%
conditions will not change.

00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.430 align:middle line:84%
So we do not need to
assume a closed economy.

00:28:24.430 --> 00:28:24.930 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.910 align:middle line:90%
So what the heck is this?

00:28:27.910 --> 00:28:32.270 align:middle line:84%
Well, this mu is the lambda
weighted marginal utility.

00:28:32.270 --> 00:28:35.300 align:middle line:84%
I substituted that into
this left-hand side

00:28:35.300 --> 00:28:39.950 align:middle line:84%
of the second expression,
set it equal to 0.

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:42.470 align:middle line:90%
And then, you've got two terms.

00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Dividing through
by this, you would

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:47.780 align:middle line:90%
set everything equal to 1.

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.990 align:middle line:84%
So it's actually easier
to look at the algebra

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:54.150 align:middle line:90%
than it is to say it in words.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.350 align:middle line:84%
We take mu here and
divide this term

00:28:57.350 --> 00:29:00.200 align:middle line:84%
by mu, which makes
it equal to unity,

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.570 align:middle line:84%
and the second term
by mu, which is

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:05.300 align:middle line:90%
what is being displayed here.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.590 align:middle line:84%
And then, the rest is
algebra, although it's

00:29:08.590 --> 00:29:11.680 align:middle line:84%
revealing that we can
take this expectation

00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:15.100 align:middle line:84%
operator outside the
whole expression,

00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:17.110 align:middle line:90%
that these returns are random.

00:29:17.110 --> 00:29:20.670 align:middle line:84%
I'm not sure I've been
emphasizing that enough.

00:29:20.670 --> 00:29:22.920 align:middle line:84%
It looked like constants,
because you just

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.690 align:middle line:90%
have the level of capital.

00:29:24.690 --> 00:29:28.710 align:middle line:84%
But the return on a unit
of capital is random.

00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:31.080 align:middle line:84%
Where did that first
start to happen?

00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:33.840 align:middle line:84%
I should have said it right here
when we had that expectation

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.050 align:middle line:90%
operator.

00:29:35.050 --> 00:29:38.430 align:middle line:84%
So anyway, bring the
expectation operator out

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:40.050 align:middle line:90%
in front of everything.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:45.390 align:middle line:84%
And then, adopt some very
cryptic notation, M--

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:50.580 align:middle line:84%
actually, M prime-- for this
term, which is essentially

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:53.310 align:middle line:84%
the discounted Lagrange
multiplier next period

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:56.550 align:middle line:84%
divided by the Lagrange
multiplier today.

00:29:56.550 --> 00:29:59.430 align:middle line:90%
So that's a discount factor.

00:29:59.430 --> 00:30:03.840 align:middle line:84%
Call it M prime, and
this R, capital R,

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:07.200 align:middle line:84%
is the total return on
the project being run,

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:09.840 align:middle line:84%
the activity R run
by household J.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.270 align:middle line:84%
The return-- you get the tree
back, plus you get the fruit.

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.450 align:middle line:90%
And this is a prime here.

00:30:15.450 --> 00:30:18.593 align:middle line:84%
It's the marginal
return, obviously.

00:30:18.593 --> 00:30:20.760 align:middle line:84%
Because when we looked at
the first order condition,

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:22.870 align:middle line:84%
we were varying the
level of capital.

00:30:22.870 --> 00:30:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So we picked up a derivative
in the production function.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.120 align:middle line:90%
So this is just notation.

00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.150 align:middle line:84%
But it's very
convenient notation.

00:30:30.150 --> 00:30:32.270 align:middle line:84%
So it's saying that
for all activities

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:38.240 align:middle line:84%
R run by households J, this
product, this expected product,

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.420 align:middle line:90%
is equal to 1.

00:30:40.420 --> 00:30:44.410 align:middle line:84%
Furthermore, looking at
that expected product,

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:46.780 align:middle line:84%
there's a result in
statistics that we

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.260 align:middle line:84%
didn't put into the
lecture on uncertainty.

00:30:50.260 --> 00:30:52.690 align:middle line:84%
But it's easy enough
to state, which

00:30:52.690 --> 00:30:55.510 align:middle line:84%
is, expectation of
two random variables

00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:58.840 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the product of
the expectations adjusted

00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:02.200 align:middle line:84%
by the covariance of
the two variables.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:07.150 align:middle line:84%
If the covariance is 0, then
these individual variables

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:08.000 align:middle line:90%
are independent.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.360 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the product
of the expectations.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.160 align:middle line:84%
But the covariance
is an easy way

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:14.090 align:middle line:84%
to adjust if they're
not independent.

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:16.120 align:middle line:84%
So now, we just
substitute in that formula

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.340 align:middle line:84%
in the previous slide, which
had this expression on the left.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:22.300 align:middle line:84%
We now substitute in the
expression on the right

00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:25.940 align:middle line:84%
and manipulate by dividing
through this expectation of M

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:26.440 align:middle line:90%
prime.

00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.280 align:middle line:90%
And we get this object here.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:33.820 align:middle line:84%
So the expected return on
activity I run by household J--

00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.770 align:middle line:90%
expected return next period--

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:39.520 align:middle line:84%
has an intercept in some
kind of product term.

00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:42.310 align:middle line:84%
And I'm about to give you
an interpretation of what

00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:43.480 align:middle line:90%
these are.

00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:46.030 align:middle line:84%
And in some respects,
this beta is going

00:31:46.030 --> 00:31:48.260 align:middle line:90%
to be a regression coefficient.

00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:52.330 align:middle line:84%
And the lambda is going to
be a measure of social risk.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:57.700 align:middle line:84%
In particular, finally, if
we imagine those production

00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:01.510 align:middle line:84%
functions are linear, then
the return on activity

00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:05.590 align:middle line:84%
I run by household J is
linear in the capital.

00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:07.670 align:middle line:90%
Constant returns to scale.

00:32:07.670 --> 00:32:11.110 align:middle line:84%
However, as I have been
trying to say, this return--

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:12.430 align:middle line:90%
this little r thing--

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:14.260 align:middle line:90%
is a random variable.

00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:17.320 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, the marginal
return is that little r.

00:32:17.320 --> 00:32:20.420 align:middle line:84%
So also, it's the average
return, for that matter.

00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:24.490 align:middle line:84%
And we can talk about the
growth rate of return equal 1

00:32:24.490 --> 00:32:28.690 align:middle line:84%
plus the net rate of return
as a definition of capital R.

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:32.740 align:middle line:84%
Just so you might feel a bit
more comfortable, if we have

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.070 align:middle line:84%
a constant returns to scale
production function actually

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:39.700 align:middle line:84%
finally modeling other inputs
like labor and materials

00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.020 align:middle line:84%
and so on, if you optimize that
and put the optimized inputs

00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:45.460 align:middle line:84%
back into the
function, you would

00:32:45.460 --> 00:32:49.700 align:middle line:84%
get this derived function, which
is linear in the capital stock.

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.520 align:middle line:84%
So that's where
it's coming from.

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.560 align:middle line:84%
But I didn't give
you that algebra.

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Secondly, what
about preferences?

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.260 align:middle line:84%
Let's let the value
function be quadratic.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.050 align:middle line:90%
So you've seen these before.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:04.390 align:middle line:90%
W star is a bliss point.

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:07.340 align:middle line:90%
And less than W star--

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.310 align:middle line:84%
so that the marginal
utility of wealth

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:11.000 align:middle line:90%
is always strictly positive.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.430 align:middle line:84%
So if we go back to this guy
here and start substituting

00:33:15.430 --> 00:33:19.930 align:middle line:84%
in what we assumed about the
production function and utility

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:22.210 align:middle line:84%
function, then
we're actually going

00:33:22.210 --> 00:33:27.820 align:middle line:84%
to get an expression which says,
the average or expected return

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:32.170 align:middle line:84%
on household J's activities
less the risk free rate

00:33:32.170 --> 00:33:36.010 align:middle line:84%
is equal to beta J
for household J times

00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:38.830 align:middle line:84%
the expected return
in the whole village

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:40.750 align:middle line:90%
minus the risk free rate.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:43.990 align:middle line:84%
In fact, you can put this R
prime F, the risk free rate,

00:33:43.990 --> 00:33:45.320 align:middle line:90%
on the right-hand side.

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:47.480 align:middle line:90%
So that would be the constant.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.830 align:middle line:84%
So it's constant plus
theta times this guy.

00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:53.500 align:middle line:84%
And let me define these
terms a little bit.

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:56.680 align:middle line:84%
R prime J no longer
has an I on it,

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:01.270 align:middle line:84%
because it's the weighted return
over all the activities run

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:05.680 align:middle line:84%
by household J. Likewise, the
return for the whole village--

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:06.970 align:middle line:90%
market, if you like--

00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:09.610 align:middle line:84%
M, is the weighted
average return

00:34:09.610 --> 00:34:13.480 align:middle line:84%
over all activities
and all households.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:16.630 align:middle line:84%
So you take the
capitalization of activity

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:21.370 align:middle line:84%
I run by household J, look at
the return on that as a peer

00:34:21.370 --> 00:34:25.449 align:middle line:84%
activity I run by household
J, sum over for the household

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:29.679 align:middle line:84%
all activities I, sum
over all households J,

00:34:29.679 --> 00:34:33.219 align:middle line:84%
you're getting a total
return over all activities

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:34.239 align:middle line:90%
in all households.

00:34:34.239 --> 00:34:36.850 align:middle line:84%
And to get a rate of
return, you divide

00:34:36.850 --> 00:34:39.280 align:middle line:90%
by the level of capitalization.

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:41.380 align:middle line:84%
And the total level
of capitalization

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:44.440 align:middle line:84%
is just the sum of the
capitals over all activities

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:45.790 align:middle line:90%
and projects.

00:34:45.790 --> 00:34:47.409 align:middle line:90%
And what is this beta?

00:34:47.409 --> 00:34:52.000 align:middle line:84%
This beta is just a covariance
divided by a variance.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.600 align:middle line:84%
As I've said, it's going to
be a regression coefficient.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.210 align:middle line:84%
If you're used to
ordinary least squares,

00:34:58.210 --> 00:35:00.370 align:middle line:84%
you know that a
regression coefficient

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:03.730 align:middle line:90%
is x prime x inverse x prime y.

00:35:03.730 --> 00:35:07.490 align:middle line:84%
So x must be in the
denominator here,

00:35:07.490 --> 00:35:11.110 align:middle line:84%
which means that we're running
on the right-hand side,

00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.820 align:middle line:90%
the total market village return.

00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.260 align:middle line:84%
And on the left-hand side,
the dependent variable

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:19.930 align:middle line:84%
is going to be the
return of household J.

00:35:19.930 --> 00:35:24.640 align:middle line:84%
So we're going to regress
the return of household J

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:27.400 align:middle line:84%
over all the periods
of the sample

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:31.030 align:middle line:84%
onto the aggregated
village level return

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:32.960 align:middle line:84%
and get a regression
coefficient.

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.230 align:middle line:84%
And that's going to
be beta J. And that's

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:39.880 align:middle line:84%
going to capture how much the
activities run by household J

00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:45.110 align:middle line:84%
are covarying with what the
village is doing as a whole.

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:49.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, as I think I
explained to you last time,

00:35:49.210 --> 00:35:52.430 align:middle line:90%
I could go from here to here.

00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:55.930 align:middle line:84%
And it would all just look
like some kind of claim.

00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:57.250 align:middle line:90%
Go see the paper.

00:35:57.250 --> 00:36:00.550 align:middle line:84%
If you don't read the paper,
it remains mysterious.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:02.560 align:middle line:84%
You have an extra
level of abstraction.

00:36:02.560 --> 00:36:04.000 align:middle line:90%
You don't believe the results.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.420 align:middle line:84%
So I actually wrote
in the algebra.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:09.610 align:middle line:84%
I am not going to
go through it today,

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:12.370 align:middle line:84%
because it is nothing
other than algebra.

00:36:12.370 --> 00:36:15.220 align:middle line:84%
But it's how to take
those two assumptions

00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:19.270 align:middle line:84%
about quadratic utility
and production functions,

00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:22.960 align:middle line:84%
and actually manipulate the
equations we already had,

00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.800 align:middle line:84%
substituting in these
particular expressions

00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.040 align:middle line:84%
and getting, at the
bottom, the expression that

00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.230 align:middle line:90%
corresponds to this, OK?

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:34.460 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to skip that.

00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:39.070 align:middle line:84%
So again, mechanically, take
the return of household J

00:36:39.070 --> 00:36:46.150 align:middle line:84%
at year T. Regress it onto
constant and onto the time

00:36:46.150 --> 00:36:49.330 align:middle line:90%
series of the market return.

00:36:49.330 --> 00:36:52.180 align:middle line:84%
And this is actually
a prime here.

00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:55.710 align:middle line:84%
We're having trouble editing
these latex files, I guess.

00:36:55.710 --> 00:36:57.700 align:middle line:90%
So this is a prime.

00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:58.560 align:middle line:90%
So we have prime.

00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.570 align:middle line:84%
This could be all today,
today, or it could

00:37:00.570 --> 00:37:02.100 align:middle line:90%
be next period, next period.

00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:04.120 align:middle line:90%
Just be consistent about it.

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:07.350 align:middle line:84%
So the return of household
J at day T regressed

00:37:07.350 --> 00:37:11.370 align:middle line:84%
on to the village level
return at dates T,

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:14.370 align:middle line:84%
running over all T.
So the sample could--

00:37:14.370 --> 00:37:15.600 align:middle line:90%
I'll show you in a minute--

00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:19.080 align:middle line:84%
something like 10 years
of data, a bit more.

00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.510 align:middle line:84%
Plus, an epsilon
is the error term.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.000 align:middle line:84%
After you run this
regression using the time

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.850 align:middle line:84%
series for each
household, one at a time,

00:37:26.850 --> 00:37:30.060 align:middle line:84%
and having estimated
these beta Js,

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.270 align:middle line:84%
we now run the next
regression, which is entirely

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.520 align:middle line:90%
cross-sectional regression.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:39.360 align:middle line:84%
We compute for each
household the average return

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:42.960 align:middle line:84%
over the entire sample, which
is a proxy for the household's

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.300 align:middle line:84%
expected return, the
data analog to that.

00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.910 align:middle line:84%
And we regress that for each
household J onto its beta J

00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:53.970 align:middle line:84%
as derived in the
first equation-- so 1.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:58.290 align:middle line:84%
So the economics here is,
the return on the project

00:37:58.290 --> 00:38:02.580 align:middle line:84%
run by household J, the
expected return, should equal,

00:38:02.580 --> 00:38:04.620 align:middle line:90%
say roughly, the risk free rate.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:06.480 align:middle line:90%
But it has a risk premium--

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.020 align:middle line:84%
first time I've use that
now with the notation.

00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:13.410 align:middle line:84%
And the risk premium has
to do with the comovement

00:38:13.410 --> 00:38:17.680 align:middle line:84%
of household J's activity
with the village aggregate.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:20.430 align:middle line:84%
So we talked about
diversification

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:22.240 align:middle line:90%
at the beginning of class.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:26.610 align:middle line:84%
And the idea here is, if the
things household J is doing

00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:29.190 align:middle line:84%
are highly correlated
with returns

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:31.650 align:middle line:84%
on what other people are
doing, then household J

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.060 align:middle line:84%
isn't doing very
much worthwhile.

00:38:34.060 --> 00:38:37.210 align:middle line:84%
Household J is not diversifying
the village level risk.

00:38:37.210 --> 00:38:40.620 align:middle line:84%
So in order to justify
the set of activities

00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:44.220 align:middle line:84%
that household J is
doing, we have to bump up

00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:46.200 align:middle line:90%
its expected rate of return.

00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:49.140 align:middle line:84%
In some sense, we use
the word risk premium,

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:52.620 align:middle line:84%
meaning household J's
activities are pretty risky.

00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:53.700 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.560 align:middle line:84%
Because they're correlated
with the village average.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.890 align:middle line:84%
So diversification
is not-- and we

00:38:58.890 --> 00:39:01.770 align:middle line:84%
need to compensate for that
lack of diversification.

00:39:01.770 --> 00:39:04.200 align:middle line:84%
The opposite is more
revealing, perhaps,

00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.520 align:middle line:84%
which is, if this
correlation is low or even 0,

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.380 align:middle line:90%
it's a wonderful hedge.

00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:13.350 align:middle line:84%
Even if not many households
are doing those things,

00:39:13.350 --> 00:39:17.250 align:middle line:84%
if household J does them and
manages to produce a return

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.400 align:middle line:84%
stream, which is not so
correlated with the return

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.400 align:middle line:84%
streams of the other households,
that's great, in which case,

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:27.570 align:middle line:84%
we don't need to have
a high risk premium.

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:30.100 align:middle line:84%
Because actually,
it's reducing risk.

00:39:30.100 --> 00:39:32.190 align:middle line:90%
So that's the economics of it.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:36.580 align:middle line:84%
It's all, also, entirely here
in terms of the equations.

00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:37.127 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:39:37.127 --> 00:39:37.960 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry.

00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.873 align:middle line:84%
I have a question
about a previous slide.

00:39:41.873 --> 00:39:42.790 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah?

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:47.590 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: So it's more
like econometrics stuff,

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.890 align:middle line:84%
because I think there should
be some estimation error here,

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.740 align:middle line:90%
because the beta is estimated.

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:56.470 align:middle line:90%
And in step 2, you just regress.

00:39:56.470 --> 00:40:01.800 align:middle line:84%
You regressive return on
some estimated beta, right?

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:12.310 align:middle line:84%
So you just regress some true
data, or some estimated data?

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:15.820 align:middle line:84%
And I think the lambda here
will have some error rate.

00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:19.360 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Well, there
are two things to adjust for.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.570 align:middle line:84%
One, this is a
regression coefficient.

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:25.150 align:middle line:90%
So it is measured with error.

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:26.920 align:middle line:90%
It has a standard error.

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:29.560 align:middle line:84%
And we do adjust the
beta that we're using

00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.350 align:middle line:90%
to allow for that uncertainty.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:35.240 align:middle line:84%
That's part of
what you're asking.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.615 align:middle line:84%
Is that what you're
asking about?

00:40:36.615 --> 00:40:40.780 align:middle line:90%


00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.830 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, probably.

00:40:41.830 --> 00:40:43.030 align:middle line:90%
But yeah, OK.

00:40:43.030 --> 00:40:46.340 align:middle line:90%
OK, yeah.

00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:53.860 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: The other
thing is that here, we're

00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.620 align:middle line:84%
regressing an individual J
return on the village average.

00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:01.640 align:middle line:84%
So you do have to be
worried about regressing

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.210 align:middle line:84%
dependent variables on the
left with their average

00:41:04.210 --> 00:41:05.930 align:middle line:90%
on the right.

00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:11.840 align:middle line:84%
And that tends to bias
this beta toward 1.

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.850 align:middle line:84%
That's another
econometric problem,

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:18.400 align:middle line:84%
except that here, we're actually
interested in dispersion

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.200 align:middle line:90%
across the different betas.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.530 align:middle line:90%
So we're OK.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:23.540 align:middle line:90%
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:27.190 align:middle line:84%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: And
this is Fama, French,

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:29.143 align:middle line:90%
which I suspect you know.

00:41:29.143 --> 00:41:30.560 align:middle line:84%
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
know that, yeah.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.477 align:middle line:90%
ROBERT TOWNSEND: Yeah.

00:41:31.477 --> 00:41:35.470 align:middle line:84%
So we're just doing what they
did with the New York stocks--

00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:41.260 align:middle line:84%
doing it here in the
Thai villages, OK?

00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:45.940 align:middle line:84%
We started our survey in
1998 with a big baseline.

00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:50.110 align:middle line:84%
We update it every
month thereafter.

00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:52.900 align:middle line:84%
This said, at the time we
were writing the paper,

00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.140 align:middle line:84%
the survey was still
ongoing, although even then,

00:41:56.140 --> 00:41:57.970 align:middle line:90%
the later months were not ready.

00:41:57.970 --> 00:42:02.500 align:middle line:84%
So we ended up using
monthly data from month 5

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.600 align:middle line:90%
to month 160 of the survey.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.420 align:middle line:84%
The other thing that's
misleading-- it's

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.310 align:middle line:90%
not ongoing anymore.

00:42:09.310 --> 00:42:12.760 align:middle line:84%
The project ended
about 18 months ago.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.880 align:middle line:84%
But we did end up with almost
20 years of monthly data.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:21.370 align:middle line:84%
So it's a vast warehouse
of potential projects

00:42:21.370 --> 00:42:22.720 align:middle line:90%
that can be done with it.

00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:24.280 align:middle line:90%
And I'm happy to tell you more.

00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:27.320 align:middle line:84%
But today, I want to
focus on this paper.

00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.710 align:middle line:84%
So we only included
the households

00:42:29.710 --> 00:42:32.710 align:middle line:84%
that were actually in the
village for the whole period.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:36.430 align:middle line:84%
Sometimes, entire households
picked up stakes and leave.

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:37.490 align:middle line:90%
We excluded them.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.820 align:middle line:84%
We also are looking
only at households

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.830 align:middle line:90%
with production activities.

00:42:41.830 --> 00:42:45.940 align:middle line:84%
Farm is included, but also
fish, shrimp, livestock, trade

00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:46.930 align:middle line:90%
and handicrafts.

00:42:46.930 --> 00:42:49.250 align:middle line:90%
But not just wage earnings--

00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:49.750 align:middle line:90%
why?

00:42:49.750 --> 00:42:51.220 align:middle line:84%
Because with wage
earnings, they're

00:42:51.220 --> 00:42:52.900 align:middle line:90%
not really producing anything.

00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.550 align:middle line:84%
They're earning something
by working for others.

00:42:55.550 --> 00:42:57.230 align:middle line:90%
So they're not entrepreneurs.

00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:59.690 align:middle line:90%
So we did not include them.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.780 align:middle line:84%
And there are extensive networks
of family in these villages.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:05.390 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to come back
to that a little bit later

00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:06.690 align:middle line:90%
toward the end.

00:43:06.690 --> 00:43:10.670 align:middle line:84%
So just to give you a
feeling of the data,

00:43:10.670 --> 00:43:14.540 align:middle line:84%
we've got net income,
which means income

00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.550 align:middle line:90%
from household enterprise.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:19.070 align:middle line:84%
It's the difference
between revenue and costs

00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:20.600 align:middle line:90%
of all the inputs.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.550 align:middle line:84%
Revenue is realized at the time
of sale, or if it's a crop,

00:43:25.550 --> 00:43:26.510 align:middle line:90%
it could be eaten.

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:31.210 align:middle line:84%
It could be given as a gift
from others at all counts.

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.190 align:middle line:90%
We add them all up.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:35.620 align:middle line:84%
Revenue even comes from
renting out assets.

00:43:35.620 --> 00:43:37.090 align:middle line:90%
We include that.

00:43:37.090 --> 00:43:40.280 align:middle line:84%
Costs are all the inputs
used in production,

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.820 align:middle line:84%
whether they're acquired
in cash or in-kind

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:44.920 align:middle line:90%
with credit or gifts.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.880 align:middle line:90%
We count them all.

00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.460 align:middle line:84%
We put a valuation
on them if it's not

00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.900 align:middle line:90%
acquired in the market.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:54.220 align:middle line:84%
So we take revenue minus
costs, include depreciation--

00:43:54.220 --> 00:43:55.450 align:middle line:90%
that came up earlier.

00:43:55.450 --> 00:43:56.740 align:middle line:90%
Subtract it.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.590 align:middle line:90%
And we get net income.

00:43:59.590 --> 00:44:02.410 align:middle line:84%
And these assets
we're talking about--

00:44:02.410 --> 00:44:06.250 align:middle line:84%
we have agricultural,
business, livestock assets.

00:44:06.250 --> 00:44:08.800 align:middle line:84%
We've also got land
and household assets.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.740 align:middle line:84%
The agricultural assets,
to give you an example,

00:44:11.740 --> 00:44:14.465 align:middle line:84%
includes walking tractors--
you might remember

00:44:14.465 --> 00:44:16.840 align:middle line:84%
in the production lecture, I
showed you a picture of that

00:44:16.840 --> 00:44:19.390 align:middle line:84%
guy walking around
with the tractor--

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:24.100 align:middle line:84%
or larger four wheel tractors,
aerators for ponds, machines

00:44:24.100 --> 00:44:27.070 align:middle line:84%
to put seeds in the
ground, machines

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:29.170 align:middle line:90%
like sprinklers, et cetera.

00:44:29.170 --> 00:44:30.940 align:middle line:90%
So you're in the village now.

00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.830 align:middle line:84%
You can imagine
living there, I think.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.190 align:middle line:84%
This is the level of
detail that we have.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:37.060 align:middle line:90%
We did put household assets in.

00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.630 align:middle line:84%
That's a decision, because
some of the things that

00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:44.170 align:middle line:84%
look like a durable good end
up being used in farming,

00:44:44.170 --> 00:44:45.460 align:middle line:90%
like a pickup truck.

00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.160 align:middle line:90%
They use it.

00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:49.060 align:middle line:84%
So rather than-- but we've
done robustness checks.

00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:51.490 align:middle line:84%
But here, we include
them all, OK?

00:44:51.490 --> 00:44:54.040 align:middle line:90%
So let me just jump here.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:59.630 align:middle line:84%
If we look at that data,
this is the return on assets,

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:04.690 align:middle line:84%
the expected return on household
J. Each J corresponds to a dot

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:05.470 align:middle line:90%
here.

00:45:05.470 --> 00:45:08.350 align:middle line:84%
And it's just the average
return for household J.

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:12.100 align:middle line:84%
On the y-axis and the beta,
the regression coefficient

00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:15.800 align:middle line:84%
on the village average
is on the x-axis.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.530 align:middle line:84%
So you can see that households
that have higher returns

00:45:20.530 --> 00:45:26.600 align:middle line:84%
are households that have higher
betas for three of the four,

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:30.380 align:middle line:84%
potentially all four, although
Buriram is not the greatest

00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.010 align:middle line:90%
example.

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:34.500 align:middle line:84%
And I have shown
this picture to guys

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.910 align:middle line:84%
working in finance with New York
Stock Exchange or Swedish Data.

00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:40.860 align:middle line:84%
And they see this
degree of correlation.

00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:43.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're like, wow,
that's really amazing.

00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:48.090 align:middle line:84%
So the theory is
working pretty well.

00:45:48.090 --> 00:45:50.000 align:middle line:90%
And this is the regression.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.420 align:middle line:90%
Doesn't really add more.

00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:55.880 align:middle line:84%
This is the regression from that
step 1 with the corresponding--

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:59.870 align:middle line:84%
sorry, step 2, it is, with
the corresponding betas.

00:45:59.870 --> 00:46:01.670 align:middle line:84%
And it's not
significant in Buriram,

00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:04.950 align:middle line:84%
but it is in the
other three provinces.

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:middle line:84%
Not sure if I've
shown you this map.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.480 align:middle line:90%
I don't think we did.

00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:13.010 align:middle line:84%
Chachoengsao and Lopburi are
relatively near to Bangkok.

00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:17.210 align:middle line:84%
And Buriram and Srisaket are
out in the agrarian regions

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:18.560 align:middle line:90%
of the northeast.

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:21.600 align:middle line:84%
So very different
types of sample.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.470 align:middle line:84%
OK, so let's talk about
idiosyncratic risk.

00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:28.610 align:middle line:84%
The return on household
J is determined by beta J

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:29.870 align:middle line:90%
that we've been talking about.

00:46:29.870 --> 00:46:32.540 align:middle line:84%
X is to make the
argument more general.

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:36.860 align:middle line:84%
So regression coefficient
times the object,

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.520 align:middle line:90%
and then an error term.

00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.970 align:middle line:84%
So if you take the variance
of both sides doing

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:46.190 align:middle line:84%
a variance decomposition,
the variance of the return

00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:49.700 align:middle line:84%
is the variance explained
by the dependent variable

00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:53.700 align:middle line:84%
with its coefficient plus the
variance of the error term.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.630 align:middle line:84%
So when we talk about
idiosyncratic risk,

00:46:56.630 --> 00:47:00.050 align:middle line:84%
we're talking about the
error term here as opposed

00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:03.320 align:middle line:84%
to how much of the variance
is determined by the village

00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.590 align:middle line:90%
aggregate.

00:47:04.590 --> 00:47:08.090 align:middle line:84%
And so you can just imagine
taking this variance term

00:47:08.090 --> 00:47:10.460 align:middle line:84%
and dividing it
through both sides.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:13.520 align:middle line:84%
And then, you'll
have one like, 100%

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.670 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the
contribution of the village

00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:20.510 align:middle line:84%
return plus the contribution
of the idiosyncratic

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:22.200 align:middle line:90%
variance to the total.

00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:23.660 align:middle line:90%
So this is not theory.

00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:27.470 align:middle line:84%
This is a way of quantifying
how much aggregate village

00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:31.190 align:middle line:84%
average risk there is and how
much idiosyncratic risk there

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:34.130 align:middle line:90%
is in an individual J's return.

00:47:34.130 --> 00:47:36.590 align:middle line:84%
Now, the next thing--
back to the regression--

00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:39.110 align:middle line:84%
as I have been saying,
in the baseline,

00:47:39.110 --> 00:47:42.050 align:middle line:84%
we're running the average
return on household J

00:47:42.050 --> 00:47:47.870 align:middle line:84%
onto a constant plus the beta
J coefficient times beta J.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.390 align:middle line:90%
And now, we do something extra.

00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:53.630 align:middle line:84%
We add in sigma J,
where sigma J here

00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:56.420 align:middle line:84%
is the variance of
this epsilon term.

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.520 align:middle line:84%
How much is it moving--
oh, it's right here,

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.830 align:middle line:84%
except that I didn't
call it sigma J here.

00:48:00.830 --> 00:48:03.500 align:middle line:84%
The variance of epsilon
J is sigma J. Stick

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.930 align:middle line:84%
that into this
cross-sectional regression

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:08.210 align:middle line:84%
as an extra right-hand
side variable.

00:48:08.210 --> 00:48:10.410 align:middle line:90%
And get a coefficient on it.

00:48:10.410 --> 00:48:13.310 align:middle line:84%
So now, we can do a
similar calculation.

00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:15.830 align:middle line:84%
We can take the
risk premium, which

00:48:15.830 --> 00:48:19.550 align:middle line:84%
is the sum of both the return
over above the risk free rate

00:48:19.550 --> 00:48:21.230 align:middle line:84%
that's due to the
aggregate return

00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:23.880 align:middle line:84%
and also due to the
idiosyncratic risk.

00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.810 align:middle line:84%
And so we can decompose
the aggregate risk

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.570 align:middle line:84%
as a proportion of the
total, and likewise,

00:48:29.570 --> 00:48:33.410 align:middle line:84%
the idiosyncratic risk as
a proportion of the total.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:35.770 align:middle line:90%
Question?

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:40.190 align:middle line:84%
So doing that, we
summarize the results--

00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:42.460 align:middle line:84%
the contribution
of idiosyncratic

00:48:42.460 --> 00:48:45.700 align:middle line:84%
risk to total risk
and the contribution

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:49.300 align:middle line:84%
of idiosyncratic risk
to the risk premium.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.610 align:middle line:84%
The contribution of
idiosyncratic risk

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:54.770 align:middle line:90%
to the total variance is huge.

00:48:54.770 --> 00:48:58.150 align:middle line:84%
This row here running
across the villages

00:48:58.150 --> 00:49:00.880 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the quartiles
including the median,

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:06.340 align:middle line:84%
you've got 98% of it,
97% of it, 94% of it.

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:13.210 align:middle line:84%
65% of the risk is coming from
the idiosyncratic component,

00:49:13.210 --> 00:49:15.640 align:middle line:90%
coming from this guy.

00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.540 align:middle line:90%
Let me back up.

00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:18.900 align:middle line:90%
Coming from this guy.

00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:22.560 align:middle line:84%
Second row of this
table is a contribution

00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:25.410 align:middle line:84%
to the risk premium of
the idiosyncratic risk.

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:26.940 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty small.

00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.590 align:middle line:90%
Two things to note--

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:33.190 align:middle line:84%
it's almost always
lower than the quantity.

00:49:33.190 --> 00:49:37.350 align:middle line:84%
So the risk premium
here is also small.

00:49:37.350 --> 00:49:39.870 align:middle line:84%
Here, it's 21%,
which isn't trivial.

00:49:39.870 --> 00:49:41.970 align:middle line:90%
Or even here, 45%.

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.690 align:middle line:84%
But the 45% is still
less than the 99%.

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:48.060 align:middle line:84%
So the contribution
to the risk premium

00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:51.480 align:middle line:84%
in terms of the compensating
returns required

00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:56.610 align:middle line:84%
for the household to run
those technologies is always--

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.530 align:middle line:84%
the contribution
to the total risk

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:02.050 align:middle line:84%
is always greater
than the risk premium.

00:50:02.050 --> 00:50:04.880 align:middle line:84%
Except Buriram
screws up over here.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:08.090 align:middle line:84%
But as you've seen, Buriram
screws up in other ways.

00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:10.645 align:middle line:84%
And then, we do a
robustness check.

00:50:10.645 --> 00:50:11.145 align:middle line:90%
Question?

00:50:11.145 --> 00:50:14.670 align:middle line:90%


00:50:14.670 --> 00:50:17.160 align:middle line:90%
OK, back to the economics.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.130 align:middle line:84%
And in medieval villages
scattered around,

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.440 align:middle line:90%
random returns.

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.120 align:middle line:90%
Should they diversify?

00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:26.940 align:middle line:84%
Do they do different
activities, et cetera?

00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.300 align:middle line:84%
Well, that depends
on the level of risk.

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:33.780 align:middle line:84%
And it turns out, there's a
lot of risk, but a lot of it

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:38.790 align:middle line:84%
is plot-specific or
activity-specific.

00:50:38.790 --> 00:50:42.630 align:middle line:84%
Most of it is idiosyncratic
and not aggregate.

00:50:42.630 --> 00:50:45.540 align:middle line:84%
It is not true that the
returns are comoving much

00:50:45.540 --> 00:50:48.570 align:middle line:90%
across all these activities.

00:50:48.570 --> 00:50:51.780 align:middle line:84%
So it's a very risky
place, as in India.

00:50:51.780 --> 00:50:54.740 align:middle line:84%
But there are plenty of
diversification possibilities

00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:57.740 align:middle line:84%
by holding multiple
activities, et cetera.

00:50:57.740 --> 00:51:00.080 align:middle line:84%
So we're back to a
version of what we did

00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:01.640 align:middle line:90%
in medieval villages, right?

00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:03.860 align:middle line:84%
How much did they
hold different plots?

00:51:03.860 --> 00:51:07.160 align:middle line:84%
Here, we are asking, how much do
they hold different activities

00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.900 align:middle line:84%
and what can be
accomplished by doing that?

00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:12.680 align:middle line:84%
And moreover, since
it's idiosyncratic,

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.770 align:middle line:90%
you can hope that it might get--

00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:18.350 align:middle line:84%
the risk premium for
the idiosyncratic stuff

00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:19.820 align:middle line:90%
might get small.

00:51:19.820 --> 00:51:22.380 align:middle line:84%
Anyway, all of this is
from the production data.

00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:24.800 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at the consumption
data, and in particular,

00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:26.210 align:middle line:90%
look at the gifts.

00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:29.600 align:middle line:84%
So now, we're going
from medieval villages,

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:32.630 align:middle line:84%
so to speak, in terms
of plots and production,

00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:37.350 align:middle line:84%
to India in terms of ex-post
consumption smoothing.

00:51:37.350 --> 00:51:40.650 align:middle line:84%
The gifts and transfers
are the ex-post part.

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:45.360 align:middle line:84%
It's how much they would give
money to each other starting

00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:45.960 align:middle line:90%
from--

00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:48.960 align:middle line:84%
do actually give
money to each other--

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:53.970 align:middle line:84%
starting from the yields on
their production activities.

00:51:53.970 --> 00:52:00.360 align:middle line:84%
So if you look back here again,
you would see these epsilons.

00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:02.000 align:middle line:90%
So this could be high.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:03.350 align:middle line:90%
This could be low.

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:07.220 align:middle line:84%
If the variance is big it's
moving the returns around.

00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.900 align:middle line:84%
What happens when
it's really big?

00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:11.390 align:middle line:90%
Then, this household got lucky.

00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:12.710 align:middle line:90%
It had a high return.

00:52:12.710 --> 00:52:14.150 align:middle line:90%
Just lucky.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:15.140 align:middle line:90%
What does it do?

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:17.350 align:middle line:90%
It gives stuff away.

00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:19.900 align:middle line:84%
Or another version--
they get unlucky.

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:21.370 align:middle line:90%
The epsilon is low.

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:22.300 align:middle line:90%
What do they do?

00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:24.310 align:middle line:90%
People give them gifts.

00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:26.390 align:middle line:84%
Well, I haven't actually
shown your result.

00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:30.100 align:middle line:84%
But that's exactly what
is going on in the data.

00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:35.670 align:middle line:84%
So if you regress those shocks,
those idiosyncratic shocks

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:40.050 align:middle line:84%
on the right-hand side onto
gifts and net lending, et

00:52:40.050 --> 00:52:42.600 align:middle line:90%
cetera, you can see both.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.390 align:middle line:84%
There is an ultimate
impact on consumption, yes,

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:48.480 align:middle line:84%
but it's small
relative to the way

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:50.040 align:middle line:90%
they're mitigating the risk.

00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:53.310 align:middle line:84%
Namely, when the
shock is high, they're

00:52:53.310 --> 00:52:56.580 align:middle line:84%
giving stuff away
and lending it out.

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:58.590 align:middle line:84%
And conversely, when
the shock is low,

00:52:58.590 --> 00:53:00.060 align:middle line:90%
they're getting this stuff in.

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:01.320 align:middle line:90%
It depends on the sign.

00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:04.920 align:middle line:84%
This is net gift outflow
when the shock is high.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:05.623 align:middle line:90%
It's positive.

00:53:05.623 --> 00:53:06.915 align:middle line:90%
It's statistically significant.

00:53:06.915 --> 00:53:09.960 align:middle line:84%
You can add up both gifts
and borrowing and lending

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.610 align:middle line:84%
and get a bigger
coefficient here.

00:53:11.610 --> 00:53:12.360 align:middle line:90%
It's 40.

00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:16.980 align:middle line:84%
So 40 relative to the impact
on consumption, which is 4.

00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:21.150 align:middle line:84%
In other words, for every
unit of idiosyncratic shock,

00:53:21.150 --> 00:53:25.510 align:middle line:84%
roughly 10% of it is making
its way into consumption,

00:53:25.510 --> 00:53:26.490 align:middle line:90%
which it shouldn't.

00:53:26.490 --> 00:53:28.650 align:middle line:84%
It violates the
risk sharing theory.

00:53:28.650 --> 00:53:34.590 align:middle line:84%
But 90% of it is being
pooled away by this village

00:53:34.590 --> 00:53:36.850 align:middle line:90%
gift-giving mechanism.

00:53:36.850 --> 00:53:39.520 align:middle line:90%
Questions?

00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.190 align:middle line:84%
In economics, we call
this the smoking gun.

00:53:42.190 --> 00:53:43.900 align:middle line:90%
You theorize a lot.

00:53:43.900 --> 00:53:45.400 align:middle line:84%
You think you know
what happened.

00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:47.300 align:middle line:90%
But what's the evidence?

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:48.400 align:middle line:90%
Well, they smoothed a lot.

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.930 align:middle line:90%
Must be the gifts.

00:53:49.930 --> 00:53:50.830 align:middle line:90%
OK, fine.

00:53:50.830 --> 00:53:52.090 align:middle line:90%
If you think so.

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:53.350 align:middle line:90%
Well, here's the evidence.

00:53:53.350 --> 00:53:55.040 align:middle line:90%
They're actually doing it.

00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.390 align:middle line:84%
And not only that, they openly
tell us they're doing it.

00:53:58.390 --> 00:54:01.280 align:middle line:84%
They are very aware that
they help each other.

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.150 align:middle line:84%
I think you might have seen
the video by now-- my movie,

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.710 align:middle line:90%
so to speak.

00:54:05.710 --> 00:54:07.000 align:middle line:90%
If not, take a look at it.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.310 align:middle line:84%
Because it describes--
you'll actually

00:54:09.310 --> 00:54:11.140 align:middle line:84%
see the setting of
these Thai villages

00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:13.720 align:middle line:84%
and how we've gathered
the data, and so on.

00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:16.760 align:middle line:84%
Michael is planning to
show that at one point.

00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.490 align:middle line:90%
But it's available.

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:19.940 align:middle line:90%
It's a 32-minute movie.

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.430 align:middle line:90%
It's not so much of a burden.

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:25.510 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see how I
spend 20 years of my life.

00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:28.280 align:middle line:84%
OK, so we've talked
about in this.

00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:32.210 align:middle line:84%
Now, let's come back
to health shocks.

00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:34.160 align:middle line:90%
No, it's not COVID.

00:54:34.160 --> 00:54:38.090 align:middle line:84%
But it is an illness
experienced by the household.

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:40.460 align:middle line:84%
And it's not covered
by insurance.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:43.140 align:middle line:90%
And the expenditures go up.

00:54:43.140 --> 00:54:47.300 align:middle line:84%
So this is normalized so
that the event happens here.

00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.510 align:middle line:84%
And health spending is
big, and other things like,

00:54:50.510 --> 00:54:51.500 align:middle line:90%
they say they're sick.

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:53.220 align:middle line:84%
They're reporting
symptoms to us.

00:54:53.220 --> 00:54:55.020 align:middle line:90%
We also measure that.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.660 align:middle line:84%
So we're pretty
much sure that we

00:54:56.660 --> 00:54:58.310 align:middle line:90%
nailed the episode, et cetera.

00:54:58.310 --> 00:55:01.790 align:middle line:84%
And sick days goes up
and stays up for a while

00:55:01.790 --> 00:55:03.530 align:middle line:90%
before it comes back down again.

00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:04.230 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:05.330 align:middle line:90%
And what happens?

00:55:05.330 --> 00:55:07.490 align:middle line:90%
There come the gifts.

00:55:07.490 --> 00:55:11.900 align:middle line:84%
Again, centered around
the episode, the event.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:15.530 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the event happens,
it's actually minus 1.

00:55:15.530 --> 00:55:17.990 align:middle line:84%
As soon as the event
happens, the gifts

00:55:17.990 --> 00:55:20.600 align:middle line:84%
are positive and
statistically different

00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:24.980 align:middle line:84%
than for households that did not
experience those health shocks.

00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:29.220 align:middle line:84%
Here, we're comparing placebo
households, if you like,

00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:31.370 align:middle line:84%
which is a dangerous
metaphor given the illness

00:55:31.370 --> 00:55:32.840 align:middle line:90%
part of it and the COVID.

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:37.460 align:middle line:84%
We're taking households pairwise
conceptually-- one set have

00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:41.480 align:middle line:84%
experienced these health
shocks, and ones that have not,

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:44.675 align:middle line:84%
and looking at the difference
in the gifts that they get.

00:55:44.675 --> 00:55:46.880 align:middle line:84%
So if they're sick,
they're much more

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:49.710 align:middle line:84%
likely to be getting
gifts than the others.

00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:53.510 align:middle line:84%
This is the same setting
as what I showed you

00:55:53.510 --> 00:55:57.560 align:middle line:84%
in rates of return, except we've
changed the subject from shocks

00:55:57.560 --> 00:56:00.120 align:middle line:90%
to production to illness shocks.

00:56:00.120 --> 00:56:04.580 align:middle line:84%
Now actually related, they're
still producing or trying to.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:06.110 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that
they've doubled,

00:56:06.110 --> 00:56:09.560 align:middle line:84%
say, their health expenditure
is a big problem for them.

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:11.870 align:middle line:84%
Because they have only
so much liquidity.

00:56:11.870 --> 00:56:13.800 align:middle line:84%
And they're supposed
to be buying inputs

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:16.950 align:middle line:84%
and so on to fund their
agriculture and so on.

00:56:16.950 --> 00:56:18.690 align:middle line:90%
So this is a liquidity shock.

00:56:18.690 --> 00:56:20.100 align:middle line:90%
It's not just a health shock.

00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.130 align:middle line:84%
In fact, sometimes,
it's an elderly person

00:56:22.130 --> 00:56:23.600 align:middle line:84%
in the household
that is not even

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.910 align:middle line:90%
contributing to production.

00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:28.120 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at
the economic impact

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.795 align:middle line:84%
of someone taking money away
from their budget, essentially.

00:56:31.795 --> 00:56:35.320 align:middle line:84%
OK, there are various kinds
of networks in these villages.

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:38.800 align:middle line:84%
This is the kinship network,
who's related to whom.

00:56:38.800 --> 00:56:41.560 align:middle line:84%
This is the financial
network in terms

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.060 align:middle line:90%
of giving gifts to one another.

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:48.100 align:middle line:84%
This is the sales network, who
they sell to in the village.

00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:51.740 align:middle line:90%
And this is who they hire from.

00:56:51.740 --> 00:56:53.950 align:middle line:84%
So the way these
pictures are produced

00:56:53.950 --> 00:56:56.440 align:middle line:84%
with the software,
roughly speaking,

00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:59.140 align:middle line:84%
households in the
middle are connected

00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.810 align:middle line:90%
to many other households.

00:57:01.810 --> 00:57:05.170 align:middle line:84%
Households on the fringe don't
have that many connections,

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:07.360 align:middle line:90%
depending on the variable.

00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.210 align:middle line:84%
And the gift giving
financial network

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:13.450 align:middle line:84%
is different from the sales
and production network.

00:57:13.450 --> 00:57:16.960 align:middle line:84%
And I'm going to show you
what happens because of that.

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.730 align:middle line:84%
I don't have a slide
to show you this,

00:57:18.730 --> 00:57:22.810 align:middle line:84%
but if they're in this gift
giving network measured

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:25.750 align:middle line:84%
by how many times they
got gifts before the shell

00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:30.760 align:middle line:84%
shock happened, then most
of the impact of the shock

00:57:30.760 --> 00:57:33.260 align:middle line:90%
is covered by incoming gifts.

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:35.350 align:middle line:90%
But what do we have in the US?

00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:36.310 align:middle line:90%
This is an issue.

00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:38.230 align:middle line:90%
A household gets sick.

00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:41.420 align:middle line:84%
Is the government going
to be able to help them?

00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:46.150 align:middle line:84%
We have these PPP Paycheck
Protection Programs and so on.

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:47.410 align:middle line:90%
Are relatives helping?

00:57:47.410 --> 00:57:48.310 align:middle line:90%
Probably so.

00:57:48.310 --> 00:57:49.790 align:middle line:90%
We don't know the extent of it.

00:57:49.790 --> 00:57:51.250 align:middle line:90%
It's not measured.

00:57:51.250 --> 00:57:53.680 align:middle line:84%
We tend to think
households are standalone.

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:54.790 align:middle line:90%
They're vulnerable.

00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:57.130 align:middle line:84%
Households running
businesses in particular

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:58.570 align:middle line:90%
get a liquidity shock.

00:57:58.570 --> 00:58:02.140 align:middle line:84%
And mainly, they don't
have sales with COVID.

00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:05.710 align:middle line:84%
Or their employees
aren't able to work.

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:09.110 align:middle line:84%
So they're not
generating revenue.

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:11.350 align:middle line:84%
Well, if it were
covered with gifts,

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:14.320 align:middle line:84%
as it is for some
people in Thailand,

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.290 align:middle line:90%
then they pool that risk away.

00:58:17.290 --> 00:58:18.640 align:middle line:90%
Great system.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.890 align:middle line:84%
If they're not, there
are other consequences.

00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:25.510 align:middle line:84%
So in particular,
we can look at who's

00:58:25.510 --> 00:58:28.420 align:middle line:84%
connected to whom in
terms of the network.

00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:31.840 align:middle line:84%
Households who experience
shocks and were

00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:36.443 align:middle line:84%
selling to other households--
their sales go down.

00:58:36.443 --> 00:58:38.110 align:middle line:84%
It's a bit counterintuitive,
because you

00:58:38.110 --> 00:58:41.140 align:middle line:84%
would think they would want
the money from the sales.

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:43.930 align:middle line:84%
But the problem is, they
had to reduce the inputs.

00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:46.790 align:middle line:84%
They had to scale
production down.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:49.570 align:middle line:84%
And so they have less
revenue as a result.

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:50.860 align:middle line:90%
Sales are down.

00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:53.290 align:middle line:90%
Inventories are up.

00:58:53.290 --> 00:58:55.420 align:middle line:84%
Well, I should-- let me
come back and clarify.

00:58:55.420 --> 00:59:00.430 align:middle line:84%
These are households connected
to the household that

00:59:00.430 --> 00:59:02.680 align:middle line:90%
has experienced a shock.

00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:04.330 align:middle line:90%
These guys were selling--

00:59:04.330 --> 00:59:05.170 align:middle line:90%
I said it wrong.

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:06.310 align:middle line:90%
I'm sorry.

00:59:06.310 --> 00:59:09.490 align:middle line:84%
These guys were selling
revenue to the household

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:10.810 align:middle line:90%
that had the shock.

00:59:10.810 --> 00:59:12.610 align:middle line:90%
Now, they sell less.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:15.400 align:middle line:84%
Likewise, because
they sell less,

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.020 align:middle line:90%
they're accumulating inventory.

00:59:17.020 --> 00:59:19.750 align:middle line:84%
And they're holding
onto inventory longer.

00:59:19.750 --> 00:59:23.140 align:middle line:84%
This is this inventory
turnover ratio.

00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:24.310 align:middle line:90%
That's a measure of--

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:26.770 align:middle line:84%
I'm going to [? tie it-- ?]
It's a measure of inefficiency.

00:59:26.770 --> 00:59:30.010 align:middle line:84%
It's also negative
with an adverse effect.

00:59:30.010 --> 00:59:33.250 align:middle line:84%
We do this for all the shocks
and do it for the large shocks.

00:59:33.250 --> 00:59:36.280 align:middle line:84%
So now, we see the
COVID connection,

00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:40.870 align:middle line:84%
which is, a household
experiences expenses associated

00:59:40.870 --> 00:59:44.620 align:middle line:84%
with the illness, even if
it's not a working member.

00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:47.050 align:middle line:84%
How do they cover
those expenses?

00:59:47.050 --> 00:59:48.370 align:middle line:90%
They try to cut back.

00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:50.050 align:middle line:90%
They cut back on spending.

00:59:50.050 --> 00:59:53.890 align:middle line:84%
In these village economies,
businesses are connected.

00:59:53.890 --> 00:59:56.170 align:middle line:84%
They're buying and selling
inputs from one another,

00:59:56.170 --> 00:59:57.650 align:middle line:90%
and selling output.

00:59:57.650 --> 01:00:00.580 align:middle line:84%
So if they have to cut back
and they don't have the revenue

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:04.060 align:middle line:84%
that they had before, the
people who had been buying

01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:08.410 align:middle line:84%
had been selling to them
no longer have the sales.

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:11.500 align:middle line:84%
Just like one business
is connected to another,

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.690 align:middle line:84%
they all go down
the supply chain,

01:00:13.690 --> 01:00:15.350 align:middle line:90%
because they're connected.

01:00:15.350 --> 01:00:19.270 align:middle line:84%
We had a lecture at the
end on interconnections

01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:20.110 align:middle line:90%
among households.

01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:21.230 align:middle line:90%
We did Leontief.

01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:23.170 align:middle line:90%
We did the input output matrix.

01:00:23.170 --> 01:00:26.710 align:middle line:84%
I showed you Fukujima
and Shima, and the effect

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:27.970 align:middle line:90%
of the earthquake there.

01:00:27.970 --> 01:00:30.940 align:middle line:84%
And those were
all supply chains.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:33.160 align:middle line:84%
One sector is
connected to another.

01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:34.870 align:middle line:90%
One firm's connected to another.

01:00:34.870 --> 01:00:37.120 align:middle line:84%
These Thai households
are connected to another.

01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:39.260 align:middle line:90%
And the point of this--

01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:42.250 align:middle line:84%
I guess I haven't said that--
is, yet, the closer they

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.640 align:middle line:84%
are to the adversely
impacted household,

01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:47.177 align:middle line:90%
the more they suffer.

01:00:47.177 --> 01:00:48.760 align:middle line:84%
So you think networks
are good things.

01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.230 align:middle line:84%
Networks are a
good thing when it

01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:52.150 align:middle line:90%
comes to financial gift giving.

01:00:52.150 --> 01:00:55.360 align:middle line:84%
But if gift giving doesn't
cover the adverse shock,

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.400 align:middle line:84%
we're actually getting
an amplification

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:59.110 align:middle line:84%
in this economy
that's showing up

01:00:59.110 --> 01:01:03.310 align:middle line:84%
in terms of lost wages and less
production, and less sales.

01:01:03.310 --> 01:01:06.520 align:middle line:84%
And finally, this
distinction, which I've

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:10.090 align:middle line:84%
been pushing today, about
aggregate and idiosyncratic

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:11.470 align:middle line:90%
shocks--

01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:14.020 align:middle line:84%
go to one of the
areas, Chachoengsao,

01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:17.440 align:middle line:84%
where they have fish ponds,
shrimp ponds in particular.

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.830 align:middle line:90%
And it's pretty polluted.

01:01:20.830 --> 01:01:24.850 align:middle line:84%
And they didn't have green
agriculture, so to speak.

01:01:24.850 --> 01:01:27.850 align:middle line:84%
And the EU put a
ban on the shrimp.

01:01:27.850 --> 01:01:29.750 align:middle line:84%
By the way, if you
go to Walmart--

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:30.580 align:middle line:90%
you say, villages?

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:31.120 align:middle line:90%
Who cares?

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:34.480 align:middle line:84%
Well anyway, they produce the
shrimp that you buy in Walmart.

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:38.350 align:middle line:84%
But the EU put a
ban on the shrimp,

01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:40.960 align:middle line:84%
because they say it wasn't
clean, which it wasn't.

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:44.020 align:middle line:84%
Now, the point is, most
but not all households

01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.300 align:middle line:90%
are doing those shrimp ponds.

01:01:46.300 --> 01:01:49.340 align:middle line:84%
And the ban is like
an aggregate shock.

01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So we can compare
the aggregate shock,

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:56.320 align:middle line:84%
which is most of the households,
to the idiosyncratic illness

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:56.890 align:middle line:90%
shocks.

01:01:56.890 --> 01:02:00.070 align:middle line:84%
And you can see that
although gifts go up--

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:01.510 align:middle line:90%
I already showed you that--

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:04.900 align:middle line:84%
for the idiosyncratic shocks,
including in this village,

01:02:04.900 --> 01:02:06.662 align:middle line:84%
there's not that
clear picture when

01:02:06.662 --> 01:02:07.870 align:middle line:90%
it comes to the shrimp shock.

01:02:07.870 --> 01:02:11.380 align:middle line:84%
Because it's an aggregate shock,
there's not a lot of ways--

01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:14.180 align:middle line:84%
excuse me-- to
reallocate that risk.

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:16.750 align:middle line:84%
And this is the
associated decline

01:02:16.750 --> 01:02:20.904 align:middle line:84%
in employment, which is bigger
under the aggregate shock.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.600 align:middle line:90%
OK, questions?

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:25.500 align:middle line:90%


01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:26.340 align:middle line:90%
OK.

01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.410 align:middle line:90%
That's what I have for today.

01:02:28.410 --> 01:02:31.240 align:middle line:90%
And we'll continue on Thursday.

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:33.000 align:middle line:90%
Thank you for coming today.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.970 align:middle line:90%
Talk to you soon.

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:45.000 align:middle line:90%

HERBERT GROSS: Hi.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.120
As I was standing here wondering
how to begin today's lesson,

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.440
an old story came to mind, of
the professor who passed out

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.175
an examination to his class,
and one of the students

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:44.800
said, "Professor,
this is the same test

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.640
you gave us last week".

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.820
And the professor said,
"I know, but this time I

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.470
changed the answers."

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.710
And I was thinking of
this in terms of the fact

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.170
that much of the new
mathematics is essentially

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.370
the old mathematics with
some of the answers changed.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.390
One of the topics that
we used to belittle

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.180
in the traditional curriculum,
because it was too easy,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.380
was the topic called
linear equations.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.430
And it turns out that in the
study of several variables

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.160
in particular-- but it was
already present in calculus

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.410
of a single variable--
we very strongly used

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.210
the concept of linearity.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.100
I could've called today's lesson
"something old, something new."

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.690
Meaning that the old topic
that we were going to revisit

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.770
would be that of
linear functions,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.270
and the new topic would
be how it manifests

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.070
into the modern
curriculum in the sense

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.240
that one introduces
a subject called

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.980
linear algebra,
or matrix algebra,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.960
as a standard portion of
a modern calculus course,

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.730
whereas in the traditional
calculus courses,

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.970
essentially nothing was ever
said about matrix algebra

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.140
or linearity.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.230
Instead I picked a
more conservative title

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.790
for today's lesson, I simply
call it "Linearity Revisited".

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.410
And as I say, it
goes back to when

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.730
we were in junior high
school or high school,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:09.419
when we were taught that linear
functions were very nice.

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:13.750
For example, given the
equation y equals m*x plus b--

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.510
the linear equation
meaning what?

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.050
It graphs as a straight line,
but that the two variables

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.100
are related linearly, y
is a constant multiple

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.670
of x, plus a constant.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.140
We were told solve
for x in terms of y.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.470
And what we found was that
if y equals m*x plus b,

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.280
this was true if and only if x
was equal to y minus b over m.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.450
What we showed was
given a value of x,

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.380
there corresponded a value
of y, and conversely,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.730
given a value for y, there
corresponded a unique value

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.780
for x.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.140
And to put this into the
language of functions,

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.650
what we were saying was that
if f of x equals m*x plus b,

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.420
then f inverse exists.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.110
In other words, what we're
saying is that no two different

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.010
x values can give
you the same y value,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.235
if the function has the
form y equals m*x plus b.

00:03:10.235 --> 00:03:12.110
And just about the time
that we were learning

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.060
to enjoy this kind
of an equation

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.540
our dream world was shattered,
and we were told it's too bad,

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.360
but most functions
aren't linear.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.260
We were given things like
y equals x to the seventh

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.920
plus x to the
fifth, and we found

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.610
that we couldn't solve
for x very conveniently

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.920
in terms of y.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.790
And that's what began
our intermediate algebra

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.410
and advanced algebra courses.

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.850
In other words, the fact that
most functions are non-linear.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.180
Now an interesting
thing occurred though.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.050
Let me just emphasize this.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.460
And this is the key point.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.460
In terms of calculus,
we discovered--

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.840
and here's a key word
coming up-- Most functions

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.140
are locally linear.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.730
Now that sounds a little
bit like a tongue twister,

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.110
but actually back in
the first part of course

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:04.520
when we talked about delta
y sub tan-- a change in y

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:05.910
to the tangent line.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:07.570
Notice what we were saying.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.680
We were saying that to study
f of x near f equals a,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.450
we saw that f of a plus
delta x minus f of a

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.089
was equal to f prime of a
times delta x plus k delta

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.660
x, where the limit of
k, as delta x went to 0,

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.400
was 0 itself.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.550
Provided of course that f was
differentiable at x equals a;

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.550
otherwise, you couldn't
write down f prime of a here.

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.420
The interesting point is this.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.100
But if you look just
at this term over here,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.410
this expresses delta f as a
linear function of delta x.

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.440
The part that makes this
thing non-linear is the term

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.150
called k delta x.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:52.180
But that's the term
that's going to 0

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.710
as a second-order infinitesimal.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.080
So what we're really
saying is this:

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.420
that provided that f
is differentiable at x

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.690
equals a-- in other words
locally we mean this:

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:09.400
near x equals a, we can say
that delta f is approximately

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.240
f prime of a times delta x.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.480
That's what we call
delta f sub tan, recall.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.430
And what we mean by
approximately here

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.710
is that error k delta
x goes to 0 very,

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:24.900
very rapidly as
delta x goes to 0.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.900
And what we mean by
locally is this-- suppose

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.970
f prime exists also
when x equals b.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.750
We can again compute delta f
near x equals b Now delta f

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.370
is equal to what?

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.610
Approximately f prime
of b times delta

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.160
x plus that error term which
goes to 0 very rapidly.

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.180
We again call this
thing here delta f tan,

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:54.240
but the thing to keep in mind
is since f prime of a need

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:00.100
not equal f prime of b, delta f
tan is different at a and at b.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.920
In other words, even
though it's always true

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.810
where f is
differentiable, that we

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.950
can say that delta f is
approximately delta f tan,

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:12.580
the value of delta f
tan depends on the value

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.280
of x that we're near.

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.170
And that's what
we mean by saying

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:18.750
that approximating
delta f by delta f

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.580
tan is a local property.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.830
Now I think that sometimes,
by putting these things

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.900
into words, it sounds
harder than it really is.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.460
So I think what might
be nice is if we just

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:33.690
look at a specific illustration,
a problem which I deliberately

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:37.250
picked to be as simple a
non-linear example as I

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.210
can think of.

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.830
Let me come back
to our old friend,

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:45.040
the function f of x equals
x squared, which as I say,

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.850
is about as simple a non-linear
function we can get into.

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.030
Now we know that f of x equals
x squared plots as the curve y

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.930
equals x squared, the parabola.

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.360
Let's take a couple of
points on this parabola.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.870
Let's say the point 1 comma
1 and the point 2 comma 4.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:08.480
Draw in the tangent lines to
the curve at these two points.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.470
And we know what?

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.110
That the equation of the tangent
line to the curve at (1, 1)

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.630
is y minus 1 over x
minus 1 equals the slope.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.750
Since y is equal to x squared,
the slope is 2x; when x is 1

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:22.970
the slope is 2.

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.640
So the equation of this tangent
line is given by y minus 1

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.920
over x minus 1 equals 2.

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.790
At the point corresponding
to x equals 2,

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:36.250
2x is 4, so the equation of the
tangent line here is y minus 4

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:38.870
over x minus 2 equals 4.

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:41.150
So now I've induced
three functions

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:42.400
that I can talk about.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:46.230
My original function,
f of x is x squared.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:49.990
This straight line is the
linear function-- just solving

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:55.860
for y in terms of x-- g
of x equals 4x minus 4.

00:07:55.860 --> 00:07:59.770
And this straight line
corresponds to the function h

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.059
of x equals 2x minus 1.

00:08:03.059 --> 00:08:04.600
Now the interesting
point, of course,

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.754
is that these two
functions here are linear.

00:08:06.754 --> 00:08:08.420
They are completely
different functions.

00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:10.530
Notice not only pictorially
are they different,

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.200
but algebraically their
slopes are different,

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.470
and their y-intercepts
are different,

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.340
and back in our
course in part one,

00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:21.910
we talked about things
geometrically saying,

00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:25.140
lookit, near the
point of tangency,

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.820
the tangent line serves
as a good approximation

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.030
to the curve itself.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.780
What were we really saying then?

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.692
What we were saying was that
near the point of tangency,

00:08:35.692 --> 00:08:39.690
g of x, which was
a linear function,

00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:43.520
could replace f of x, which
was a non-linear function.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.320
Of course, when we
moved too far away

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:48.680
from a given point, then when
we said that f of x still

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.880
had a linear
approximation, we had

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.780
to pick a different
linear function.

00:08:53.780 --> 00:08:55.390
By the way, again
because we were

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.700
dealing with one
independent variable and one

00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:00.490
dependent variable, it
was very easy to invent

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:02.280
the concept of a graph.

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:06.320
As we shall show in a little
while, the concept of linearity

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.860
extends to several
variables, but you

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.880
can't draw the graph as nicely.

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.530
So let me now revisit the
same result here, only

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.730
without reference to the graph.

00:09:17.730 --> 00:09:21.120
What we're saying
is that our function

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.555
is mapping the real number
line into the real number line.

00:09:24.555 --> 00:09:26.680
In other words, instead of
putting x and y at right

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.800
angles to each other, let's put
x and y horizontally parallel

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:32.840
to one another.

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:39.060
And what we're saying is that
f maps the interval from 0 to 2

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:43.370
onto the interval from 0 to 4.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:44.750
Now what does h do?

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:47.760
Remember h is the
function 2x minus 1.

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.620
h maps the interval from
0 to 2 onto the interval

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:54.770
from minus 1 to 3.

00:09:54.770 --> 00:09:58.700
And you see this is all this
diagram means. f maps 0 into 0,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.340
it maps 1 into 1, it
maps 2 into 4, et cetera.

00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:06.070
In other words, f is the
function which squares

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:08.140
the input to yield the output.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:13.430
And correspondingly, h maps 0
into minus 1, it maps 1 into 1,

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.190
and it maps 2 into 3.

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.110
Now the interesting
point is that f and h

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:19.570
are very different.

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:23.710
In fact, the only time f
and h have the same output

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:27.610
is when x equals 1.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:29.310
Which, of course,
we knew from before,

00:10:29.310 --> 00:10:31.730
because how was h
of x constructed?

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:36.300
h of x was constructed to be the
line tangent to the parabola y

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:39.600
equals x squared at the
point x equals 1, y equals 1.

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:41.830
So that should be
no great surprise.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.040
But if we didn't know that,
notice that algebraically, we

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.450
could equate f of x to h
of x, conclude, therefore,

00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:51.910
that that means x squared
must equal 2x minus 1.

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:57.610
We then transpose, and get that
x minus 1 squared must be 0,

00:10:57.610 --> 00:11:00.290
whence x must equal 1.

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:03.890
And what we have is
that near x equals 1,

00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:08.080
x squared behaves like-- and
I put this in quotation marks,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:11.210
because that's the hardest
part of the course that's

00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:14.350
going to follow, was what do
you mean by behaves like-- but x

00:11:14.350 --> 00:11:17.370
squared behaves like 2x minus 1.

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.260
And what we mean by
that is this, at least

00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.740
in terms of a picture.

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:24.130
If I pick a small
interval surrounding

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:28.020
x equals 1 on the x-axis,
and a small interval--

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:33.660
like a thick dot-- surrounding
y equals 1 on the y-axis here.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:40.090
Then, as a mapping from
this domain into this range,

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:45.520
I can essentially not
distinguish f from h.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:49.800
The error is so small that
as the size of the interval

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.370
shrinks, the error
goes to 0 even faster.

00:11:53.370 --> 00:11:56.900
And therefore, if I stay
close enough, locally,

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:59.520
to the point in question-- if
I stay close enough to this

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.880
point, I cannot tell
the difference between

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:05.140
the non-linear function
and the linear function.

00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.290
But what I have to be
careful about is this--

00:12:07.290 --> 00:12:11.350
that whereas x squared can
be replaced by 2x minus 1

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:15.120
near x equals 1,
near x equals 2,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.860
x squared can be replaced again
by a linear function, namely

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:20.230
4x minus 4.

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:23.610
But 4x minus 4 is
not approximately

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:26.950
the same as 2x minus 1,
no matter where you look.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:29.460
You might say well, lookit,
don't these two straight lines

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.010
intersect at the
particular point?

00:12:31.010 --> 00:12:33.050
The answer is yes they do.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:35.610
But even at the point
that they intersect,

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:38.410
there was no
neighborhood in which

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:42.410
these lines can serve as
approximations for one another.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:44.220
Those are two
straight lines that

00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.490
intersect at a constant
angle, and as soon

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:48.430
as you leave the
point of intersection

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:50.050
there is a significant error.

00:12:50.050 --> 00:12:53.860
Meaning an error which
does not go to 0 more

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.260
rapidly than the change in x.

00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.820
You don't have that higher-order
infinitesimal over here.

00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:02.470
At any rate, leaving
this to the exercises

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:04.880
and the supplementary notes,
for you to get more out of,

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.810
in summary, let's just say
this: if f is continuously

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:12.530
differentiable at x equals a,
then locally-- meaning near x

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.060
equals a-- f behaves linearly.

00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:17.030
In other words,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:21.970
f of x is approximately f
of a plus f prime of a times

00:13:21.970 --> 00:13:26.880
the quantity x minus a, and you
see, once x is chosen to be a,

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.830
this is a number,
this is a number,

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:32.080
delta x here is
the only variable

00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:33.440
on the right-hand side.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.960
So what we're saying is
that f of x is a what?

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.770
Linear function of delta x.

00:13:39.770 --> 00:13:42.160
And the more
interesting point is--

00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.860
since this is all review,
so I say-- what I mean

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:46.509
by interesting point is what?

00:13:46.509 --> 00:13:48.300
That we don't have to
just review this way,

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.330
we did this simply to
refresh your memories

00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.300
as to how linearity was
playing a big role in calculus

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.800
of a single variable.

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.900
Now what we're going to
do is extend the result

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:00.190
to several variables.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.420
Let me just say
that at the outset.

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.240
That this concept does
extend to n variables,

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.270
but n equals 2 yields
a particularly good

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:10.010
geometric insight.

00:14:10.010 --> 00:14:13.870
For example, let's suppose I
look at two equations and two

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:15.500
unknowns.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:19.002
Well actually, I'll
use u and v instead.

00:14:19.002 --> 00:14:19.960
Let those be variables.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.960
Also, we can think of
this as a function.

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.540
I have u of x, y is x
squared minus y squared,

00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.510
whereas v of x, y is 2x*y.

00:14:28.510 --> 00:14:30.960
Notice that these
are not linear,

00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.640
because here we have
things appearing

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.540
to second power, squares,
and here we have what?

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:38.560
The variables
multiplying one another.

00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:42.230
These are not linear equations,
but the beautiful point

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:45.830
is-- if you look at this way--
is even without a picture,

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.720
I can think of this
as a mapping which

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.630
maps two-dimensional space
into two-dimensional space.

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:52.540
And how does this
mapping take place?

00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:55.720
It maps the point or the
pair, or the 2-tuple--

00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.220
whichever way you
want to say it--

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:01.410
x comma y into the
2-tuple u comma v,

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:06.510
where u is x squared minus
y squared, and v is 2x*y.

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:07.790
In other words,

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.590
f-bar-- and notice I
put the bar underneath,

00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:13.810
simply to indicate that
E^2 is a vector space,

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.700
and we have a function
that's mapping what?

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:20.890
A vector into a vector, so I
indicate that f is a vector

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:21.570
function here.

00:15:21.570 --> 00:15:23.870
It maps a vector into a vector.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.730
And how does the
mapping take place?

00:15:25.730 --> 00:15:30.670
It maps the 2-tuple x comma
y into the 2-tuple x squared

00:15:30.670 --> 00:15:33.700
minus y squared comma 2x*y.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.630
(u, v).

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.380
Now, the thing is that as long
as we only have n equals 2,

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.650
we can still draw a picture, but
not a picture as nice as what

00:15:42.650 --> 00:15:45.470
existed when n was equal to 1.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:49.500
See, pictorially,
f-bar maps the xy-plane

00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.350
into what we can
call the uv-plane.

00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:55.880
But notice that since
the domain of f-bar

00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:59.170
has two degrees of freedom-- a
two-dimensional vector space--

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:03.360
notice that the domain of
f-bar is the entire xy-plane,

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.610
whereas the range of f-bar
is the entire uv-plane.

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.880
In other words, I
can now view f-bar

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.300
as a mapping which carries
points in the xy-plane

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.600
into points in the uv-plane.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.020
And this will be exploited
more later in the course,

00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:20.550
but the idea is this.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:22.470
Let's take a look
for the time being.

00:16:22.470 --> 00:16:26.520
Let's see what f-bar does
to the point 2 comma 1.

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:30.350
Remember u is x squared
minus y squared,

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:33.310
so at the point 2 comma
1, u becomes what?

00:16:33.310 --> 00:16:36.840
2 squared minus 1
squared, which is 3.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.360
On the other hand, 2x*y is 2
times 2 times 1, which is 4.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:45.930
So f-bar can be viewed as
mapping the point 2 comma

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:50.010
1 into the point 3 comma 4.

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.610
Now you recall
that calculus isn't

00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:55.470
interested in what's happening
at a particular point.

00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:58.630
It's interested in what's
happening in the neighborhood

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:00.050
of a particular point.

00:17:00.050 --> 00:17:03.700
So the major question
is, how does f-bar behave

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.390
near the point 2 comma 1.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:08.750
In other words,
what is f-bar of 2

00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:13.970
plus delta x comma 1 plus delta
y, when delta x and delta y are

00:17:13.970 --> 00:17:14.710
quite small.

00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.700
That's the question that
we're raising over here.

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:21.250
What we're saying is, we know
that 2 comma 1 maps into 3

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:22.790
comma 4.

00:17:22.790 --> 00:17:26.109
We also know or we'd like to
believe that a point near 2

00:17:26.109 --> 00:17:30.050
comma 1 maps into a
point near 3 comma 4.

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.120
Well if we call
this point 2 plus

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.030
delta x comma 1
plus delta y, then

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.100
the corresponding
image over here

00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.390
should be 3 plus delta
u comma 4 plus delta v.

00:17:42.390 --> 00:17:46.190
What we can say is that
whatever the image of 2

00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:48.930
plus delta x comma
1 plus delta y

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:54.120
is, it has the form 3 plus
delta u comma 4 plus delta v,

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:57.970
and all we have to do is find
delta u and delta v. This

00:17:57.970 --> 00:18:00.720
is the pictorial idea
of what's happening.

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.050
Now the point is that
delta u and delta

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.920
v are very difficult to find.

00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:07.840
After all, u and v are
non-linear functions.

00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.140
To invert them is
either difficult,

00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.450
or downright impossible, one
or the other, in many cases.

00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:19.430
The thing that's easy to find
is delta u tan, and delta v tan.

00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:23.460
Remember delta u tan was the
partial of u with respect to x

00:18:23.460 --> 00:18:26.400
times delta x, plus the
partial of u with respect to y

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.730
times delta y.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:30.620
Since u is equal to x
squared minus y squared,

00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:35.240
that means delta u tan is
2x delta x minus 2y delta y.

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.640
We're interested in this
at the point 2 comma 1.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:43.360
Letting x be 2, and y be
1, we see that delta u tan

00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:46.580
is 4 delta x minus 2 delta y.

00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:49.810
Similarly, since v
is equal to 2x*y,

00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:52.790
the partial of v with
respect to x is 2y;

00:18:52.790 --> 00:18:55.830
the partial with v with
respect to y is 2x.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:19:01.230
Therefore, delta v sub tan is
2y delta x plus 2x delta y.

00:19:01.230 --> 00:19:03.450
Since we're evaluating
this at x equals 2,

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:08.560
y equals 1, we see that delta v
tan is two delta x plus 4 delta

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:09.500
y.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.390
Now here's the key point.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.270
This is always delta u tan.

00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:16.600
This is always delta v tan.

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.030
Where the local
thing comes in is

00:19:19.030 --> 00:19:22.220
that we know that because
u and v are continuously

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:26.950
differentiable functions of x
and y, that near the point 2

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:32.380
comma 1, we can replace delta
u by delta u sub tan, delta v

00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:36.010
by delta v sub tan, and
we wind up with what?

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:40.110
delta u is approximately
4 delta x minus 2 delta y.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:43.780
delta v is approximately
2 delta x plus 4 delta y.

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:49.470
But the key point
now is that this is

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:51.760
a system of linear equations.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.620
You see, delta u is
a linear combination

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.130
of delta x and
delta y, and delta v

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:01.590
is also a linear combination
of delta x and delta y.

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:03.530
In other words,
as long as u and v

00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:07.460
are continuously differentiable
functions of x and y,

00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:11.650
we can approximate,
locally, delta u and delta

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:15.070
v by linear approximations.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.310
Notice how linear
systems come into play.

00:20:18.310 --> 00:20:21.300
Now I've been emphasizing
the case n equals 2 just

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:23.020
so we could draw a picture.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:26.150
Notice that no matter how
many variables we have-- well,

00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:29.820
in fact, let me just summarize
this in terms of x and y first.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:34.090
And then we'll generalize it
to n variables in a minute.

00:20:34.090 --> 00:20:36.410
The key point for two
variables, and what

00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.250
happens for two variables
happens for any number.

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.950
But as we've often
done in this course,

00:20:41.950 --> 00:20:44.260
we emphasize the
two-variable case

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.950
because we can still
visualize the picture.

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:50.320
Even though the graph
idea is hard to see,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.910
because we're mapping two
dimensions into two dimensions.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:56.520
But at least the
domain and the range

00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.970
are easy to see
separately, but if u

00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:00.920
is a continuously
differentiable function

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:05.280
of x and y near the
point (x_0, y_0),

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.850
then delta u is exactly the
partial of u with respect to x

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:14.630
times delta x, plus the partial
of u with respect to y times

00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:20.440
delta y, plus an error term,
k_1 delta x plus k_2 delta y,

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.610
where k_1 and k_2 go to 0, as
delta x and delta y go to 0.

00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:27.490
In other words,

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:31.530
if we just look at
this part alone,

00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:37.000
delta u is linear up to
this as a correction term.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.450
In other words, the
non-linearity part of delta u

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:44.060
is going to 0 as a
second-order infinitesimal,

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:46.470
and the reason I keep
harping on this point

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:49.140
is that no matter how
complex the theory gets,

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.520
in the rest of this
particular block,

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.050
the key step is
always going to be

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:55.810
that when you have
a continuously

00:21:55.810 --> 00:21:59.580
differentiable function you
can essentially-- as long you

00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.380
stay locally-- you
can essentially

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.910
throw away the nasty part.

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.730
You can essentially throw
away this error term,

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.720
because it goes to 0 so
rapidly that if you stay close

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.170
enough to the point
x_0, y_0, no harm comes

00:22:12.170 --> 00:22:13.870
from neglecting this term.

00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:15.850
What you must be
careful about is

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:18.490
that as soon as you pick a
large enough neighborhood so

00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.040
that this term is no
longer negligible, then

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:25.250
even though this part here
is still delta u sub tan,

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:29.880
delta u sub tan is no longer a
good approximation for delta u.

00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:33.580
At any rate, in n variables,
what we're saying is,

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:37.280
suppose w is a function
of x_1 up to x_n.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:39.960
Then if w happens
to be continuously

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:42.540
differentiable at the
point corresponding

00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:46.850
to x-bar equals a-bar--
meaning, in terms of n-tuples,

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:50.510
x_1 up to x_n is the
point a_1 comma up

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:55.110
to a_n-- then what we're saying
is that delta w can be replaced

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.710
by-- now this has been
mentioned the text,

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.100
I don't remember whether
we've mentioned this

00:23:00.100 --> 00:23:02.300
in previous lectures or not.

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:03.780
It's rather
interesting that when

00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:07.660
you deal with more than three
independent variables we

00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.340
somehow don't like to use
the word delta w sub tan.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.470
Because tangent indicates a
tangent line or a tangent plane

00:23:15.470 --> 00:23:17.280
which is a geometric concept.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:23.430
Instead we replace the
word tangent by L-I-N

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:26.020
as an abbreviation for linear.

00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.550
The key point being what?

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:30.730
That this thing that we
call delta w sub lin,

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.260
or if you like to call it
sub tan, what's in a name?

00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.800
Call it whatever you want.

00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.975
The point is that this thing
that we call delta w sub

00:23:37.975 --> 00:23:42.370
lin or delta w sub tan is
the partial of f with respect

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:46.770
to x_1 evaluated at
a-bar times delta x1,

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:49.390
plus the partial
of f with respect

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:53.970
to x sub n evaluated at
a-bar times delta x_n.

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:56.060
And the key point
is that once you

00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.770
have chosen a
specific number a-bar,

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.770
notice that the coefficients
of delta x_1 up to delta x_n

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.940
are numbers.

00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.060
They're not variables.

00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.500
They are numbers
once a is chosen.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.360
So that what is delta w lin,
why do we call it linear?

00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.510
Notice that this expression
here is a linear combination

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:19.790
of delta x_1 up to delta x_n.

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.110
In other words they're what?

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:25.980
Sums of terms each involving
a delta x times-- excuse me.

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.770
A delta x times a constant.

00:24:29.770 --> 00:24:32.470
What we're saying is
that nice functions,

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.240
and what's a nice function?

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.830
A nice function is one which
is continuously differentiable.

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.550
A nice function
is locally linear.

00:24:41.550 --> 00:24:45.840
In other words, a continuously
differentiable function,

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:51.390
near a particular point,
can be approximated

00:24:51.390 --> 00:24:54.460
by a linear function,
where the error will

00:24:54.460 --> 00:24:56.590
be very small as
long as you stay

00:24:56.590 --> 00:24:58.025
near the point in question.

00:24:58.025 --> 00:24:59.900
You remember, at the
beginning of my lecture,

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.510
I said something
old, something new.

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:06.020
This finishes the old
part of the course.

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.020
In other words, what I've
tried to motivate for you here

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.850
is why, if we were remodeling
the pre-calculus curriculum,

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:17.500
much more emphasis should
be paid to linear equations.

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:22.210
Granted that most functions
in real life are non-linear,

00:25:22.210 --> 00:25:27.340
the point remains that
locally, functions are linear.

00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:28.630
OK?

00:25:28.630 --> 00:25:30.870
That's the key point.

00:25:30.870 --> 00:25:33.653
Locally we deal with
linear functions.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:40.010
Therefore, since all
non-linear functions

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:42.790
may be viewed as
being linear locally,

00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:44.890
this motivates why we
should really study

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.030
systems of linear equations.

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.810
In other words, this
motivates the subject

00:25:48.810 --> 00:25:50.800
called linear systems.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.630
Now what is a linear system?

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:58.720
Essentially, a linear system
is m equations in n unknowns.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:01.840
In many cases m and n
are taken to be equal,

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:03.680
but what kind of
equations are they?

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:06.890
They are equations where all
the variables appear separately

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:10.940
to the first power multiplied
only by a constant term,

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.670
and by the way, let me
introduce this double subscript

00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:18.220
notation rather than introducing
umpteen different symbols

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.390
for constants.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:21.400
Notice that a very
nice device here

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:25.800
is to pick one symbol, like an
a, and then use two subscripts.

00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:29.280
The first subscript
telling you what row

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:32.520
the coefficient is referring
to, and the second one

00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:33.760
which column.

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.030
Or in terms of the equations,
the first subscript

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:39.630
tells you which equation
you're dealing with,

00:26:39.630 --> 00:26:42.150
and the second
subscript tells you

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:44.510
what variable it's multiplying.

00:26:44.510 --> 00:26:46.360
For example this is what?

00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:51.930
This is the coefficient of x
sub 1 in the first equation.

00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:57.140
This is the coefficient of x
sub n in the first equation.

00:26:57.140 --> 00:27:04.880
This is the coefficient of x
sub n in the n-th equation.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:08.270
Think of this as the row
and the column if you will.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:13.270
And what we're saying then is
that the solutions of this type

00:27:13.270 --> 00:27:16.460
of system of equations
are really controlled

00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.820
by the coefficients of the x's.

00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:22.480
In other words, by
the numbers a sub ij,

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.760
where i and j can take on--
well i takes on all values

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.380
from what?

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:39.110
The number of rows. i goes from
1 to m, and j goes from 1 to n.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:42.070
But the a's become
very important,

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:43.570
and this is what
ultimately is going

00:27:43.570 --> 00:27:46.280
to motivate what we
mean by a matrix,

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.910
but before I come to that,
let me give you just one

00:27:48.910 --> 00:27:54.510
example of what I mean by saying
that the equations are governed

00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:59.020
by the coefficients of the
x's, not by the constants

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:00.480
on the right-hand side.

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.340
By the way, notice
the convention

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.980
that when you have two
equations with two unknowns,

00:28:04.980 --> 00:28:07.760
rather than call the
unknowns x_1 and x_2,

00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.910
it's conventional to call
the unknowns x and y.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.030
Let's take a particularly
simple system here-- x plus y

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:17.530
equals b_1, x
minus y equals b_2.

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.540
If we add these
two equations, we

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:23.320
get 2x is b_1 plus
b_2, whereupon

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.720
x is b_1 plus b_2 over 2.

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.440
If we subtract
the two equations,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:32.640
we get 2y is b_1
minus b_2, whereupon y

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:35.720
is b_1 minus b_2 over 2.

00:28:35.720 --> 00:28:38.950
Notice that this tells us
how to solve for x and y

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.060
in terms of b_1 and b_2.

00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:44.400
Namely, to find x you take
half the sum of the two b's.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.280
To find y, you take
half the difference.

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:49.710
Now certainly, the
solution depends

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:51.900
on the values of b_1 and b_2.

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:54.520
I'm not saying you don't
change the answers by changing

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.860
the constants on this side.

00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:59.280
What I am saying is that
the structure by which you

00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.670
find the answers does not
depend on b_1 and b_2;

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:07.370
it's determined solely by
the coefficients of x and y.

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:08.950
What we're saying
is, no matter what

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:11.690
b_1 and b_2 are in this
particular problem,

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:15.400
to find x and y we take half
the sum of the b's, and we

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:17.300
take half the difference.

00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:18.860
In other words, the
solution depends

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:24.232
on b_1 and b_2 numerically,
but not structurally.

00:29:24.232 --> 00:29:26.190
Well, the whole idea is
this-- and this is what

00:29:26.190 --> 00:29:28.480
we so often do in mathematics.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:32.570
Because the solution
to our equations

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:36.420
depends on the coefficients
of the x's, we somehow

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:40.130
want to focus our attention
on the coefficients.

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:41.810
And we don't need
the x's in there,

00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:45.380
because we can sort of think of
the x's as being a place value

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:46.430
type of situation.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:49.070
In other words,
x_1 can be thought

00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:51.470
of as being the first column.

00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:53.200
x_2 the second column.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:56.090
The first equation can be
thought of as the first row.

00:29:56.090 --> 00:29:58.070
The second equation,
the second row.

00:29:58.070 --> 00:30:00.270
And what this
motivates is a concept

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.500
called an m by n matrix.

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.930
Now this sounds like a very
ominous term, an m by n matrix.

00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:10.070
But the point is it's
not a very ominous term.

00:30:10.070 --> 00:30:12.980
It's in fact, I think
that it's too-- in fact

00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.180
the word matrix essentially
indicates an array,

00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:17.620
and that's all this thing is.

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.910
By an m by n matrix, we simply
mean a rectangular array

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:26.870
of numbers, arranged
to form m rows--

00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:27.690
In other words,

00:30:27.690 --> 00:30:33.870
the first number tells
you the number of rows,

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:38.070
and the second number tells
you the number of columns.

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:40.070
Now there's certainly
nothing logical about that

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:41.620
in terms of our game idea.

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.187
Just memorize this, it's a rule
of the game or a definition.

00:30:44.187 --> 00:30:45.770
Somebody could've
said, why didn't you

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.590
give the columns first
and then the rows?

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:50.000
Well we could've, but one
of them had to come first.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.890
And the convention is that
one refers to the rows

00:30:52.890 --> 00:30:54.910
first, and then the columns.

00:30:54.910 --> 00:30:57.030
An m by n matrix then is what?

00:30:57.030 --> 00:31:00.520
It's a rectangular array
of numbers consisting

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.970
of m rows and n columns.

00:31:03.970 --> 00:31:08.580
By way of an example-- by the
way, to indicate that's you're

00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:10.590
talking about a
matrix, one usually

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:16.209
encloses the array in
brackets, or in parentheses.

00:31:16.209 --> 00:31:17.500
It doesn't make any difference.

00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:21.180
I will use whichever one
strikes my fancy at the moment.

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.310
And it happens to be
brackets right now.

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:26.110
But if I write down this
array-- what is it now?

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:31.070
[1, 1, 1; 1, -1, 2].

00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:35.120
This is a rectangular array
of numbers consisting of what?

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:40.220
Two rows and three columns.

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:44.170
And so this is an example
of a 2 by 3 matrix.

00:31:44.170 --> 00:31:45.990
A 2 by 3 matrix.

00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:49.500
Now again, we don't want to
invent this thing vacuously.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:53.230
Let's keep track of
what this matrix is

00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:57.291
coding for us in terms
of a system of equations.

00:31:57.291 --> 00:31:57.790
Well.

00:31:57.790 --> 00:32:01.790
For example, suppose we have
the system of equations z_1

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:05.350
is equal to y_1
plus y_2 plus y_3.

00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:09.870
z_2 is equal to y_1
minus y_2 plus 2*y_3,

00:32:09.870 --> 00:32:13.270
and we want to think
of the y_1, y_2,

00:32:13.270 --> 00:32:19.000
and y_3 as being the
variables, z_1 and z_2 as being

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.020
the constants here.

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:22.580
What is the matrix
of coefficients here?

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.410
Well the matrix would be what?

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:32.070
The coefficient of the first
variable in the first column

00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:35.110
is 1; second variable,
first column is 1;

00:32:35.110 --> 00:32:39.870
third variable, first row is 1.

00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:40.550
You see?

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.930
Second equation, first
variable coefficient

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:48.120
is 1; second equation,
second variable coefficient

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.540
is minus 1;

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:53.010
second equation, third
variable coefficient is 2.

00:32:53.010 --> 00:32:55.360
So using our matrix
coding system,

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.490
the matrix of coefficients
would be what?

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:03.580
[1, 1, 1; 1, -1, 2].

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:08.296
Which is exactly the matrix
that we wrote down over here.

00:33:08.296 --> 00:33:10.170
And to put this into a
different perspective,

00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:13.610
so to see what we're driving
at, let's take a second example

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:17.400
where we first start out
with three equations and four

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:17.950
unknowns.

00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.150
Three linear equations
and four unknowns.

00:33:20.150 --> 00:33:22.560
And then we'll write the
matrix for this afterwards.

00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:27.470
But let the equations be y sub 1
is x_1 plus 2*x_2 plus x_3 plus

00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:28.900
x_4.

00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.510
y_2 is 2*x_1 minus x_2
minus x_3 plus 3*x_4.

00:33:33.510 --> 00:33:37.760
y_3 is 3*x_1 plus x_2
plus 2*x_3 minus x_4.

00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:41.165
if I want to write the matrix
of coefficients, what do I do?

00:33:41.165 --> 00:33:44.610
I simply leave the variables
out, and write down what?

00:33:44.610 --> 00:33:46.230
My first row would be what?

00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:49.460
[1, 2, 1, 1].

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:54.700
My second row would
be [2, -1,  -1, 3].

00:33:54.700 --> 00:34:00.320
My third row would
be [3, 1, 2,  -1].

00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.440
In other words, my
matrix of coefficients,

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.840
now, would be what
kind of a matrix?

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.440
It would be a rectangular
array of numbers,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:12.719
consisting of three
rows and four . columns.

00:34:12.719 --> 00:34:13.690
All right?

00:34:13.690 --> 00:34:16.510
And that would be
called a 3 by 4 matrix.

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:20.000
Again, notice, in this coding
system, the number of rows

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.330
corresponds to the
number of equations.

00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:26.340
And the number of
columns corresponds

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:29.250
to the number of
variables that are

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.590
formed in linear combinations.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.820
To summarize this
again, the matrix

00:34:36.820 --> 00:34:39.280
of coefficients in
our second example

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:48.040
is the 3 by 4 matrix [1, 2, 1,
 1; 2, -1, -1, 3; 3, 1, 2, -1].

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.070
Well again, let's recall
that when we do mathematics,

00:34:52.070 --> 00:34:53.909
we don't like to
introduce notation

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:55.409
for the sake of notation.

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:59.970
And simply to be able to have
a way of conveniently writing

00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.990
the coefficients, but
not being able to use it

00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:06.620
efficiently would be a
rather stupid thing to do.

00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:09.700
Why invent new notation
if it's not going to help

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.180
us effectively
solve new problems?

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.850
This is why in mathematics
we've been emphasizing

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:20.170
the game idea, whereby what we
really care about is structure.

00:35:20.170 --> 00:35:24.270
We care about structure, not
about the terms themselves.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:26.090
And to motivate
what I'm driving at,

00:35:26.090 --> 00:35:29.000
let me return to
examples one and two.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.060
And bring up a question
that has great impact--

00:35:34.060 --> 00:35:36.200
and even if we don't
appreciate it right now

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.210
in terms of a
practical application,

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.680
let's at least see
what's happening.

00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:44.660
You'll notice that if I look
at these systems of equations

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:49.000
over here, notice that the
first two equations tell me

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.810
how to express z_1 and z_2 in
terms of y_1, y_2, and y_3.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:57.930
On the other hand, the
second system of equations

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.190
tells me how to express
y_1, y_2, and y_3 in terms

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:05.500
of x_1, x_2, x_3, and x_4.

00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:06.990
Now, without
belaboring the point

00:36:06.990 --> 00:36:10.160
because the arithmetic
is quite trivial here,

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:12.980
a very natural question
that might come up next this

00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:15.710
is, lookit, let's look at
our old friend the chain

00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:16.650
rule again.

00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:18.690
Since the z's are
expressed in terms

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:21.600
of the y's, and the y's
are expressed in terms

00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:24.970
of the x's, it seems that
by direct substitution,

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:29.190
I should be able to express
the z's in terms of the x's.

00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:34.410
Namely, I replace y_1 by this
linear combination of the x's.

00:36:34.410 --> 00:36:38.510
I replace y_2 by this linear
combination of the x's.

00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:43.050
I replace y_3 by this linear
combination of the x's.

00:36:43.050 --> 00:36:50.040
| then combine the y's in terms
of the x's as indicated here.

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.860
And that should give me the
z's in terms of the x's.

00:36:52.860 --> 00:36:57.780
Leaving that, hopefully,
as a trivial exercise,

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.890
we come to the next example
that I'd like to mention here,

00:37:00.890 --> 00:37:03.710
and that is: suppose
you were told

00:37:03.710 --> 00:37:09.350
to express z_1 and z_2 in
terms of x_1, x_2, x_3 and x_4.

00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:13.240
The point is that, with the
amount of arithmetic mentioned

00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:20.070
before, we could easily show
that z_1 was 6*x_1 plus 2*x_2

00:37:20.070 --> 00:37:22.610
plus 2*x_3 plus 3*x_4,

00:37:22.610 --> 00:37:29.900
while z_2 was 5*x_1 plus
5*x_2 plus 6*x_3 minus 4*x_4,

00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:32.590
by a straightforward
substitution.

00:37:32.590 --> 00:37:34.380
The point is that
somehow or other,

00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.500
we would like to be able to
handle this substitution more

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.010
efficiently.

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:46.050
Is there a neater way of
being able to transform

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:49.500
the z's into the x's
by way of the y's?

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.300
In other words, is there
a way of replacing the y's

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:54.690
by the x's, and then
finding z's in terms

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:58.630
of x's in a convenient,
mechanical way that

00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.640
will save us much steps?

00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:04.620
Not so much in these easy
examples where you have 2 by 3,

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:08.365
and 3 by 4 systems, but
cases where you might have

00:38:08.365 --> 00:38:10.140
10 equations and 10 unknowns.

00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:12.460
Or 10 equations and 12 unknowns.

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:14.191
And the answer is,
there is a way.

00:38:14.191 --> 00:38:16.190
Of course, you knew there
was going to be a way.

00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:18.100
Otherwise we wouldn't
be leading up to it

00:38:18.100 --> 00:38:21.200
in this particular way,
and as so often happens,

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.400
there usually happens to be
a real-life situation that

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.520
motivates why we
invent something

00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:29.720
called matrix algebra.

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:31.860
In terms of our
present illustration,

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.840
the chain rule that
we're just talking

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.570
about expressing the z's in
terms of the y's, and then

00:38:36.570 --> 00:38:39.170
the y's in terms of
the x's motivates

00:38:39.170 --> 00:38:42.240
what we mean by
matrix multiplication.

00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.400
And you may notice that I
put "multiplication" here

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.000
in quotation marks.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.720
The reason I put
in quotation marks

00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:51.520
is that unfortunately
the word "multiplication"

00:38:51.520 --> 00:38:55.250
has a connotation of
multiplying numbers together.

00:38:55.250 --> 00:38:56.510
Don't think of it that way.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:38:58.490
Think of multiplication
meaning what?

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:03.260
A way of combining two matrices
to form another matrix.

00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.950
There's going to be no logic
behind this other than one

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.930
very famous piece of logic.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:12.220
That is knowing what the
answer was supposed to be,

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.560
we make up our rules
to guarantee us

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.995
that we will get the
appropriate answer.

00:39:17.995 --> 00:39:18.620
In other words,

00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:22.300
I remember when I was an
undergraduate in college.

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:25.030
The big type of humor that
was going around at that time

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:27.540
was the idea of, somebody
would give you the answer,

00:39:27.540 --> 00:39:29.685
and you have to make
up the question.

00:39:29.685 --> 00:39:31.310
Oh, they were silly
little things like,

00:39:31.310 --> 00:39:35.115
if the answer to the question
was 9w what was the question?

00:39:35.115 --> 00:39:36.490
And the question
would be, do you

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:39.970
spell your last name with a
V, Herr Wagner, and the answer

00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:41.440
would be "nein, W."

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.164
And these were funny
jokes at that time.

00:39:43.164 --> 00:39:45.080
I don't know whether
they're funny now or not.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.730
But the funny point is this.

00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:49.520
That this joke, which
might not be that funny,

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.750
is exactly how we motivate
definitions and rules

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:53.620
in mathematics.

00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:56.150
We start with the
answer, and then

00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:58.460
go back, and answer
the question.

00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:01.550
Knowing in advance
that somehow or other,

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:03.820
the matrix that
expresses the z's

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.880
in terms of the y's
is given by this.

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.940
And the matrix that expresses
the y's in terms of the x's, is

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:13.830
given by this matrix.

00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:16.680
Somehow or other what
we would like to do

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:22.070
is invent a way of combining
these two matrices to give me

00:40:22.070 --> 00:40:24.970
the matrix that
expresses this answer.

00:40:24.970 --> 00:40:27.940
In other words, if I start
knowing what the answer is

00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:31.390
supposed to be-- in other
words, what is the matrix that

00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:33.950
expresses the z's
in terms of the x's?

00:40:33.950 --> 00:40:38.020
It's the matrix whose
first row is [6, 2, 2, 3].

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:42.240
And whose second row
is [5, 5,  6, -4].

00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:43.990
In other words, the
matrix would be what?

00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:50.530
[6, 2, 2, 3; 5, 5, 6, -4].

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:52.880
And without even looking
at any mechanical rule,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.390
the question that
comes up is, how can I

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:57.630
invent a rule that
will tell me how

00:40:57.630 --> 00:41:04.470
to multiply this 2 by 3
matrix by this 3 by 4 matrix

00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:08.480
to obtain this 2 by 4 matrix?

00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:10.900
2 by 4 matrix.

00:41:10.900 --> 00:41:11.520
Now lookit.

00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:14.530
In the notes, I'm going to
do this in great detail.

00:41:14.530 --> 00:41:16.680
There will be many
exercises on this for you

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.670
to sharpen your teeth on.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:22.030
But for now I just want
to hit this main point,

00:41:22.030 --> 00:41:24.560
because the lecture
is quite long.

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:28.110
Your attention span probably
is starting to be taxed.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:31.480
And so I just want to show
you what the recipe is,

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.180
because my feeling is
that this is something

00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.350
you have to hear before you can
really read it without becoming

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:40.540
panicked by the notation.

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:44.320
The idea is this: first of
all, to multiply two matrices,

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:47.780
all we ever require is
that the number of columns

00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:51.250
in the first matrix
equals the number of rows

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.800
in the second matrix.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.090
And if that sounds
complicated to you,

00:41:55.090 --> 00:41:58.800
simply think in terms
of the chain rule again.

00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:01.850
The number of columns
in the first matrix

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:03.500
tells you how many
unknowns there

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.070
are in the first
system of equations.

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.730
And that number of
unknowns gives you

00:42:09.730 --> 00:42:12.690
the number of equations
in the second system.

00:42:12.690 --> 00:42:16.200
In other words, the number of
columns in the first matrix

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.880
must match the number of
rows in the second matrix.

00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:25.290
Notice, we don't care
about the number of rows

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:27.690
in the first one matching
the number of columns

00:42:27.690 --> 00:42:31.280
in the second, all we care
is that the number of columns

00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:34.230
in the first matrix--
namely three here-- match

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:37.410
the number of rows of the
second, which is three.

00:42:37.410 --> 00:42:41.640
Then the rule works in a very
interesting mechanical way that

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.610
makes use of the dot product.

00:42:43.610 --> 00:42:45.650
Namely, what you
do is, suppose I

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:50.080
want to find the term in the
product of these two matrices

00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:55.200
that occupies the second
row, third column.

00:42:55.200 --> 00:42:58.430
What I do is I take the
second row-- in other words,

00:42:58.430 --> 00:43:02.190
I take the row comes
from the first matrix.

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:04.830
I take the column value
from the second matrix.

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:06.240
In other words, I have what?

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:10.150
Second row, third column.

00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:14.810
And I form the usual dot
product that we've talked about.

00:43:14.810 --> 00:43:18.350
I dot the second row
with the third column.

00:43:18.350 --> 00:43:20.010
And what would I
get if I did that?

00:43:20.010 --> 00:43:27.310
1 times 1 is 1; minus 1 times
minus 1 is 1; and 2 times 2

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:28.200
is 4.

00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:32.470
So 1 plus 1 plus 4 is 6.

00:43:32.470 --> 00:43:35.690
So in this product
matrix, the term

00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:39.920
in the second row,
third column will be 6.

00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.820
The term in the second row,
third column will be 6.

00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.570
Second row, third
column will be 6.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.460
Now, leaving it as an
exercise for the time being,

00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.230
and reading it in the
supplementary notes,

00:43:52.230 --> 00:43:54.460
I'm sure you'll be able
to put this all together.

00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:57.220
It's not nearly as
difficult as it sounds

00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.760
hearing it the first time.

00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:01.850
I think the most difficult
part is rationalizing

00:44:01.850 --> 00:44:05.260
why one would invent such a
definition in the first place.

00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:08.620
The answer is very simple:
we invent the definition

00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.470
to solve a particular problem.

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:13.800
Coming back here
again, all I'm saying

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.790
is that if I
invent-- for example,

00:44:15.790 --> 00:44:18.330
let me just give you one
more checking-out point here.

00:44:18.330 --> 00:44:20.210
Let me see what
the term would be

00:44:20.210 --> 00:44:22.420
in the first row, second column.

00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:26.150
To find the term in the
first row, second column,

00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:29.560
I take the first row
of the first matrix.

00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:35.260
Dot it with the second
column of the second matrix.

00:44:35.260 --> 00:44:37.800
See first row dotted
with second column,

00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.630
the answer will give me what?

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:42.030
The term in the product
that's in the first row,

00:44:42.030 --> 00:44:43.030
second column.

00:44:43.030 --> 00:44:44.050
Let's check that.

00:44:44.050 --> 00:44:50.550
1 times 2 is 2; 1 times minus
1 is minus 1; 1 times 1 is 1.

00:44:50.550 --> 00:44:53.530
2 minus 1 plus 1 is 2.

00:44:53.530 --> 00:44:57.490
And therefore, the term in
the first row, second column

00:44:57.490 --> 00:45:00.520
should be 2.

00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.020
It is.

00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:02.680
You see, there's
no more motivation

00:45:02.680 --> 00:45:05.890
to how we multiply these
two matrices than the fact

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:09.950
that it solves the problem
that we want solved.

00:45:09.950 --> 00:45:13.260
To find the term
that's in the i-th row,

00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:17.730
j-th column of the
product, dot the i-th row

00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:20.950
of the first matrix
with the j-th column

00:45:20.950 --> 00:45:23.550
of the second matrix.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:29.180
More generally, you can always
multiply an m by n matrix

00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:32.330
by an n by p matrix.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.240
What's the key factor?

00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.720
You don't care about the
number of rows in the first,

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.170
you don't care about the number
of columns in the second.

00:45:39.170 --> 00:45:41.030
What you do care about is what?

00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:45.380
That the number of columns
in the first matrix

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:48.450
be equal to the number
of rows in the second,

00:45:48.450 --> 00:45:52.120
and if you do that, when you
multiply an m by n matrix

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:56.550
by an n by p matrix, notice
that the result will be what?

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.750
An m by p matrix.

00:45:58.750 --> 00:46:01.230
In other words,
the number of rows

00:46:01.230 --> 00:46:05.100
is governed by the number
of rows in the first matrix

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:07.890
and a number of
columns is governed

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:11.790
by the number of columns
in the second matrix.

00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:13.840
Notice, by the way,
that this tells us

00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:17.660
right away that when we want
to multiply two matrices

00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.310
it makes a difference in which
order that they're written.

00:46:21.310 --> 00:46:26.440
If we were to take that 2 by 3
matrix, and the 3 by 4 matrix,

00:46:26.440 --> 00:46:30.220
and interchange them, we don't
have the appropriate match

00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:32.600
up of rows and columns.

00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:35.930
You can't dot a
2-tuple with a 4-tuple.

00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:39.530
The very fact that we say
dot the row with the column,

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.630
the dot product is only
defined for two n-tuples.

00:46:42.630 --> 00:46:45.480
We insist that the
n-tuples be the same.

00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:49.520
The n has to be the same
to dot two n-tuples.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.680
Let me summarize today's
lecture by saying

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.850
that in overview, notice
that what we've done,

00:46:55.850 --> 00:46:58.090
hopefully, is that
we have reestablished

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:01.250
the need for linear
systems of equations,

00:47:01.250 --> 00:47:03.760
and secondly, once we
have understood what

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:06.970
the need for linear systems
is, we are now introducing

00:47:06.970 --> 00:47:11.310
a mechanism whereby we can
solve linear systems more

00:47:11.310 --> 00:47:14.580
efficiently than what we were
taught in the past as to how

00:47:14.580 --> 00:47:15.750
to solve them.

00:47:15.750 --> 00:47:18.490
You see, what I'm going to do
for the next few lectures now

00:47:18.490 --> 00:47:21.470
is concentrate on
a new game, called

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:23.880
the game of matrix algebra.

00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:27.950
But that will unfold gradually
as we develop the next two

00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:28.750
lectures.

00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:31.330
And so until our next
lecture, so long.

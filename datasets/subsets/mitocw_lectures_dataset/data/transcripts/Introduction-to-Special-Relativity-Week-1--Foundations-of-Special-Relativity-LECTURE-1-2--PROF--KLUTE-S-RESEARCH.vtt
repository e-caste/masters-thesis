WEBVTT

00:00:12.528 --> 00:00:14.320
PROFESSOR: Hello, and
welcome back to 8.20,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:15.400
special relativity.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.430
In this little video,
I'm going to continue

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.970
with my introduction, and
talk about the research I'm

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.900
interested in.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.030
So this is not strictly on the
topic of special relativity,

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:30.370
but you will see some
of the influences

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:34.370
of my research in the class
as well as we move along.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.040
So what am I interested in,
and what am I working on?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.010
I work on the Large
Hadron Collider.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.090
You see behind me here a
picture of the CMS detector.

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:46.900
CMS detector is one of
two omni-purpose detectors

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.250
at the Large Hadron Collider.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.880
There's also LHCb and ALICE,
two more dedicated experiments.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.280
The Large Hadron
Collider collides

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.830
protons at the highest
possible energies.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:02.500
In some units, 13 TeV--

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.570
tera-electronvolts
collision energy.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.080
Collisions happen
around 40 million times

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.160
per second in this machine
when it's operational.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.970
And we have made great progress
in understanding nature

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.270
using this machine in
the last about decade.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.080
The Large Hadron Collider
started operating in 2009.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.090
They are currently
in a shutdown phase,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.140
but we hope to restart next
year with even higher center

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.780
of mass energies
available for our studies.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.520
So why do we need a
machine like this?

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.290
Colliding particles
at high energies

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.440
allows us to probe the
structure of matter

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.010
like with a big microscope.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.680
And so we can look very
deeply into the structure

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.030
of the proton.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.980
At the very same time, we can--

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.700
this high center of mass
energies and collisions

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.090
produce perhaps new particles--
unexpected particles.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.020
We will later see
E equals mc squared

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.495
as a result of
special relativity.

00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:12.160
And when you have
enough energy, you

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.300
might be able to produce a
new particle of high mass.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.950
And so that's kind
of the Holy Grail,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.570
and what we're trying to do.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.210
And the other
thing we do here is

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.320
by colliding protons and
sometimes even lead ions,

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.760
we are able to create a very
hot and dense form of matter

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.560
similar to the environment
after the Big Bang,

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.070
and be able to study
this new form of matter.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.700
Let's see how mass and
matter are being built.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.280
If you take the table
in front of you,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.350
and you start looking
in detail, you

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.250
start seeing
molecules and atoms.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.290
The atoms are built of
electrons and the nuclei.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.080
The nuclei itself is built
of protons and neutrons.

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.890
And if you look more
precisely-- drill deeply

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.810
into the structure-- you see
that a proton on the surface is

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.120
built out of quarks--

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.940
up quarks-- two up
quarks and a down quark.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.490
If you further investigate
the structure of the proton,

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.900
you see that there's
much more going on.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.090
There's gluons-- particles
holding the quarks together.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.540
And there's also bunches
of quarks and anti-quarks.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.660
This is by now well understood.

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.670
If you ask what is the
mass of the proton,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.640
it's about one
giga-electronvolts,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.120
or 938 mega-electronvolts.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.710
But where does the
mass come from?

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:40.170
The mass of the
proton comes, in part,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.480
of the mass-- from the
mass of the quarks.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.530
But in most parts from
the gluons, or the field

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.290
which holds the quarks together.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.800
That's kind of surprising,
but if you had 8.02 already,

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.450
you know that there's
energy stored in a field,

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.290
and that energy, again,
is equivalent to the mass.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.300
So the energy stored in the
gluon field holding the quarks

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.420
together gives
mass to the proton.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.630
And this was quite well.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.600
There's a theory which
describes all of this.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.270
It's called QCD--
quantum chromodynamics.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.519
And if you-- with
some assumption,

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.910
you can calculate the mass
of a bunch of particles.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.670
So this plot here
shows the light hadron

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.610
spectrum which can be calculated
using just [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.820
What I'm actually
interested in is the mass

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:32.350
of elementary particles.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.030
So this discussion so
far was a brief overview

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.310
in how composite particles like
your table becomes massive.

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.620
But how does the quark
itself acquire mass?

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.220
How does an electron acquire
mass, or a muon and a tau.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.810
This picture here shows you
all known elementary particles.

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.850
We can put them in three boxes--

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.520
quarks-- those are
the particles--

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.400
the up quarks and the down
quarks we found in the proton.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:05.560
The electron makes--
together with the proton

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.940
makes the hydrogen atom.

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.800
And there's neutrinos.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.150
Those are core electrons.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.620
And then there's force carrier.

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:15.250
And we just met the gluons, but
there's also the photon, the W

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.580
and the Z boson And the WZ
boson, they are themselves

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:21.070
also massive particles.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:23.200
How do they acquire mass?

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.860
The answer was found
by us about 8 years ago

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.970
with the discovery of the
Higgs boson, a new particle.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.610
And the underlying
theory explains

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.920
how particles acquire mass.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.730
And so basically solved, right?

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:41.630
Not quite.

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.090
So this is really
mysterious to see

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.170
how different the masses of
those elementary particles

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.870
actually are.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.540
You see on this
logarithmic table here.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.690
Again, here are our friends
the down quark, the up quark,

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.470
and the electron.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.510
And if you compare
this, for example,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.570
with the heaviest known
elementary particle,

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:01.490
the top quark, you
see many, many orders

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.770
of magnitude difference.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.908
So how does this actually work?

00:06:06.908 --> 00:06:08.450
And then you see
some of the bosons--

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:10.040
the force carriers are massive.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:15.210
Others, like the photons
and gluons, are massless.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.630
The answer to this was
the Higgs mechanism.

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:22.410
And a very simple explanation
how the Higgs mechanism

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:25.960
actually works for fermions for
those quarks-- so the electron,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:26.790
for example--

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:29.260
is given in this cartoon.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.530
So the idea is that a
field fills all of space.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.470
It's basically a
property of the vacuum.

00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:39.960
And when you travel
an elementary particle

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.980
through this vacuum, you
interact with this field.

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.430
And the stronger you interact,
the more drag you kind of get.

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.110
There's some sort of--
you feel an inertia.

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.460
And this inertia is
what we know as the mass

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.600
of the elementary particle.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.500
So there is an equivalence
between how strongly you're

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:03.500
coupled to the vacuum-- to the
Higgs field, and your mass.

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.580
And so a top quark couples
strongly to this Higgs field,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.550
while an electron only slightly.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.410
Great.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.240
So we have understood
everything.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.850
So the question
is why do we still

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.240
collide protons and
bosons at the LHC?

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.890
Is there anything
else to be discovered?

00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:27.610
So it turns out that we have
a very sophisticated theory

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.850
describes those particles
and their interactions,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.840
but this theory fails to
explain all of the observations

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:36.320
we have in nature.

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.810
And so that is
kind of the driving

00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:42.200
force behind the experiment
I'm conducting right now.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.460
And so for example, we know
that there is dark matter.

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:48.520
When we look at the rotation
of stars and galaxies,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:53.380
we find that they don't behave
as you would expect simply

00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:57.160
based on the distribution
of matter in those galaxies.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.710
There must be something else
out there, and that's what--

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:01.120
since it's not visible--

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.110
is called dark matter.

00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.020
And those dark matter--

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.910
dark matter could be
a particle we might

00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.160
be able to produce at the LHC.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.160
So that's an
interesting question.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.050
Also when you look
out into the universe,

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:15.520
we see a lot of matter.

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:17.650
You don't see a
lot of antimatter.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:21.700
So there must be an
asymmetry between how

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.430
matter and antimatter
is being produced.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.368
And so that is also not
fully understood yet.

00:08:27.368 --> 00:08:28.660
And then there's more question.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.610
For example, those neutrinos,
they are really, really light.

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.220
On this logarithmic
scale, I had a cut off,

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.539
and then the neutrino masses.

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.700
Do neutrinos acquire
mass as an electron

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:43.340
does, as a top quark does, or
is it a different mechanism?

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:45.190
We don't know.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:47.740
Gravity is not even included
in the standard model.

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:49.930
And the fact that
the Higgs boson

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.380
was discovered at a specific
mass which is rather small it's

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.780
also a little bit unnatural.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.930
And so there is this
entire list of questions

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.620
and unresolved mysteries
which we're trying to answer.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.140
And the way we do this
is with big cameras.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:07.570
So this is CMS detector.

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:11.027
There's a similar
picture that's behind me.

00:09:11.027 --> 00:09:12.610
You can think about
it as a big camera

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:16.270
looking at the interaction of
the collision of two protons.

00:09:16.270 --> 00:09:19.360
And it starts off with around
this interaction region

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:23.620
with pieces of silicon, which we
use to track charged particles

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:24.910
going through.

00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:26.780
We put all of this
in a magnetic field,

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.770
and if you listen
to 8.02 already,

00:09:29.770 --> 00:09:32.650
you know the charged
particle in magnetic field,

00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.858
they follow a curvature.

00:09:34.858 --> 00:09:36.400
And from the radius
of the curvature,

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:40.750
we can calculate the
momentum of those particles.

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:42.730
And then we stop the
particles in order

00:09:42.730 --> 00:09:44.920
to measure their energy.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:46.330
So we do this in kilometers.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:49.330
And what we use here is the
lead tungstate electromagnetic

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.810
calorimeter, and a second
calorimeter for particles

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.970
which are harder to stop.

00:09:54.970 --> 00:09:57.257
So those are called
atomic calorimeters.

00:09:57.257 --> 00:09:58.840
And then the silver
part in the middle

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.670
here gives the CMS
detector its name.

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:05.380
It's the solenoid.

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:09.340
It's a 2-- a 3.8 Tesla
superconducting magnet.

00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:13.540
And then we have more detectors
there to see whether or not

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.700
some particles
might escape, and we

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.770
try to measure those as well.

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:20.260
There's another
very nice picture.

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:22.840
After opening the detector,
you see this silver thing

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:23.890
in the middle here.

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:26.200
It's the pipe in
which the protons

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.950
zoom through the detector,
and broaden into collision

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:31.290
in the very center part of it.

00:10:33.637 --> 00:10:34.970
And then we take those pictures.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:37.370
Here's one, and this
is a very famous one.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.340
It's a Higgs candidate event,
where the Higgs boson might

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.700
have decayed into two Z
bosons, and then those Z

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:47.990
bosons themselves decayed again
into a pair of electrons shown

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:50.330
here, and a pair of muons here.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.330
And then we can use those
individual particles

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.600
to reconstruct the property
of the Higgs boson.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.750
Here's another candidate where
there's two photons being

00:10:59.750 --> 00:11:01.058
reconstructed.

00:11:01.058 --> 00:11:02.600
And again, those
two photons can then

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.560
be used in order to
reconstruct, for example,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.040
the mass of the particle,
which is the original first two

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:07.540
protons.

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:12.400
So we have done this
for the last years,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:14.990
and collected quite some data.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:17.110
And if we look at the
entirety of the data,

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:18.700
we can make this plot here.

00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:22.870
And what this plot here shows
is the mass of the particle

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.170
and the coupling of the
particle to the Higgs field.

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:28.900
And what you see, there is a
linear relationship in this

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:33.760
log-log plot between those
two, and that gives us some

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:36.970
confidence that the elementary
particle-- like a muon here,

00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:40.930
like a tau lepton, and
a bottom quark here,

00:11:40.930 --> 00:11:42.400
like a top quark here--

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.270
they acquire mass through the
coupling of the Higgs field.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.070
And so there's this
linear relationship--

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:50.380
the correspondence
between mass and coupling

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.700
to the Higgs field.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:53.200
Great.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.630
So we have this all
together, and it gives us

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.930
a complete theory.

00:11:56.930 --> 00:12:00.760
Again, there are a large number
of open mysteries and questions

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.320
we'd like to answer.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.270
And the way I look at
it is it's a little

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:09.970
similar to the exploration
of Christopher Columbus.

00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:11.980
So what we're trying
to do is to go

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.170
to higher and higher
energies, to higher and higher

00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:16.690
intensities to find
out whether or not

00:12:16.690 --> 00:12:20.380
we find first hints of
something new and unexplored.

00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.950
So we made this discovery.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.980
We made the discovery
of the Higgs boson,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:26.770
but whether or not this particle
is really the Higgs boson

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:28.490
is still out there.

00:12:28.490 --> 00:12:31.570
We're trying to measure it
with more and more precision.

00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:35.800
Maybe we find deviations
from its expected properties

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.050
to the ones we observe.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:43.520
Similarly, Christopher Columbus,
when he sailed off from Spain,

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:51.250
he tried to reach the Indies
or Asia, and in his lifetime,

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.050
he never figured out--
they didn't actually

00:12:53.050 --> 00:12:54.130
accomplish this.

00:12:54.130 --> 00:12:57.340
And similarly, maybe we have
discovered a new particle

00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.430
which helps us to
understand more

00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:04.230
about the inner structure
of particle [INAUDIBLE]..

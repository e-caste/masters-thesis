00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.480
We have said that the Bernoulli
process is the simplest

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.520
stochastic processes there is.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.490
But what is a stochastic
process anyway?

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.515
A stochastic process
can be thought

00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:14.140
of as a sequence of
random variables.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.800
Now, how is this different
from what we have doing before,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.390
where we have dealt with
multiple random variables?

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.560
Well, one difference
is that here we're

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.810
talking about an infinite
sequence of random variables.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.980
And that complicates
things to a certain extent.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.740
Now, what does it take to
describe a stochastic process?

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.980
We should specify the
properties of each one

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.620
of those random variables.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.810
For example, we might be
interested in the mean,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.820
variance, or PMF of
those random variables.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.580
For the case of the
Bernoulli process,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.920
this would be easy to do.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.940
We know what the
expected value is.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.340
We have a formula
for the variance.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.700
And we have a fairly simple PMF.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.580
There's probability p that X
is equal to 1 and probability 1

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.190
minus p that X equals to 0.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.069
But this is not enough.

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.930
We also need to know how the
different random variables are

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.640
related to each other.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.900
And this is done by specifying,
directly or indirectly,

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.990
the joint distribution,
the joint PMF or PDF,

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.390
of the random
variables involved.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.990
And because we have an infinite
number of random variables,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.100
it's not enough to
do this, let's say,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.850
for the first n of them.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.360
We need to be able to specify
this joint distribution

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.410
no matter what the number n is.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.470
For the case of the
Bernoulli process,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.690
we have specified this joint
PMF in an indirect way,

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.539
because we have said that
the random variables are

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.450
independent of each other.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.210
So the joint factors as a
product of the marginals.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.830
And we already know
what the marginals are.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.830
So we do, indeed, have a
specification of the joint PMF,

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.460
and we have that
for all values of n.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.430
Of course, for more complicated
stochastic processes,

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.100
this calculation might be
somewhat more difficult.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.040
Now, there is a second view
of a stochastic process

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.840
which rests on the following.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.340
It's not just a collection
of random variables,

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.620
but they are a
collection that's indexed

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.090
by an index that
keeps increasing.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.070
And quite often, we think of
this index as corresponding

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.530
to time.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.380
And so we have a
mental picture that

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.530
involves a process that
keeps evolving in time.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:32.810
What is this picture?

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.470
This picture is
best developed if we

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.920
think in terms of
the sample space.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.440
Although we have an infinite
sequence of random variables,

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.190
we are dealing with
a single experiment.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.329
And that single
experiment runs in time.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.610
And when we carry
out the experiment,

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.970
we might to get an outcome
such as the following.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.879
For the Bernoulli process, we
might get a 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1,

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:59.510
0, and so on.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.100
And we continue.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.640
So an infinite
sequence of that kind

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.400
is one possible outcome of this
infinitely long experiment,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.200
one particular outcome of
the stochastic process.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.310
If we carry out the
process once more,

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.590
we might get a
different outcome.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:25.550
For example, we might get a 0,
1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, and so on,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.810
and continuing.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.760
And in general, any time
function of this kind

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.430
is one possible outcome
of the experiment.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.300
Overall, the sample space
that we're dealing with

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:45.490
is the set of all infinite
sequences of 0s and 1s.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:54.810
This point of view
emphasizes the fact

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.910
that we have a phenomenon
that evolves over time

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.650
and can be used to
answer questions that

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.650
have to do with the long-term
evolution of this process.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.310
Here's one particular
kind of question

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.340
we might want one answer.

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.010
What is the probability that all
of the Xi's turn out to be 1?

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.079
Notice that this is an event
that involves all of the Xi's

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:20.630
not just a finite
number of them.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.650
So this is not a
probability that we

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:26.380
can calculate right away
by using this joint pmf.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.100
We need to do a
little more work.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.600
What is the work
that we want to do?

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.010
Instead of calculating
this quantity,

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.900
we will calculate a
somewhat related quantity.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.159
Let us look at the
event that the first n

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:44.180
results were equal to 1.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.810
How is this event
related to this event?

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.920
Well, this event here implies
that this event has happened.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.050
So this is a smaller event.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.430
This is more difficult
to obtain than this one.

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.810
And this gives us an inequality
for the probabilities

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.380
that go this way.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.160
Now, we know that
this probability

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.630
is equal to p to the n.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.940
And this inequality
here is true for all n.

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.550
No matter how large n
we take, this quantity

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.470
is smaller than that.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:26.120
But now, since p has been
assumed to be less than 1,

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:28.190
when we take n
larger and larger,

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.570
this number becomes
arbitrarily small.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.480
So this quantity is
less than or equal

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.430
to an arbitrarily small number.

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:38.400
So this quantity can
only be equal to 0.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.900
And this is a simple example
of how we calculate properties

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:47.710
of the stochastic process as it
evolves over the infinite time

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:52.620
horizon and how we can
sometimes calculate them using

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.090
these so-called finite
dimensional joint probabilities

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.100
that tell us what
the process is doing

00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.130
over a finite amount of time.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.670
Throughout, we will sometimes
view stochastic processes

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.090
in this manner, in terms of
probability distributions.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:13.010
But sometimes we will
also want to reason

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.880
in terms of the behavior
of the stochastic process

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:21.150
as a time function, as a
process that evolves in time.

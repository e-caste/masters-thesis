00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.340
PROFESSOR: So this is
an example in SCET one

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.715
where the degrees of freedom
in the p plus p minus plane

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:34.465
looked as follows.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.470
So we had hard modes
that lived out here at p

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.880
squared in order some
large scale q squared,

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.590
then we had collinear
modes for the two jets

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.660
that are going to be
going back to back,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.580
and I'll draw the
picture in a second.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.530
Then there were some
ultra soft modes

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.500
as well that describe
radiation between the jets.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.100
And then there can be also
some lambda QCD modes,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.545
and we'll talk about
them a bit today too.

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:13.670
So there's a lot of different
things going on here,

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.460
but we'll see that actually
we can understand everything

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.210
and organize things using SCET.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.720
So what's the picture
for these modes?

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.350
We have back-to-back jets.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.655
Let me draw one jet this
way, one jet this way.

00:01:30.655 --> 00:01:31.750
I should use some color.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.990
So there's one of our jets.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.800
There's another, and then
there can be soft radiation.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.180
And between these
jets, there can also

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.498
be soft radiation
physically within the jets,

00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:05.040
but there's no
directional dependence

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.150
to the soft radiation.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.660
And then set that this is blue.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.384
This and this so far are
orange in my picture.

00:02:25.384 --> 00:02:31.200
This is green, and then
there's some hard interactions,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.590
which we've already
sort of localized

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.480
into a dot in this picture.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.500
So what we're doing
is we're colliding

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.130
e plus e minus producing
a virtual photon or z

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.490
and then from that
producing, if you like,

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.100
a state which is full of
collinear modes, state which

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.770
is full of the other
type of collinear

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.130
modes and ultra soft particles.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.020
And this is in the
center of mass frame,

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.512
or that's kind of how you
could think about it in SCET,

00:03:12.512 --> 00:03:13.970
or physically what
you're producing

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:24.200
is you're producing jet 1
plus jet 2 plus soft radiation

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.165
or ultra soft
hadrons, soft hadrons.

00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:41.650
OK, so the first scale that
you want to think about

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.270
is the hard scale,
and so that is just

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.820
the q squared to the
virtual photon or z.

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.640
So if you think about
the Feynman diagram,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.430
there's e plus e minus.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.660
Here's q mu.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.310
You're going to have
a pair of quarks

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:00.358
that that virtual
particle can couple to,

00:04:00.358 --> 00:04:01.900
and there could be
additional gluons.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.320
But the hard scale is set
by the virtual photon or z.

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.750
So there's going to be
some scale associated

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.209
to that hard scale q.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.529
If you want to think about
it as a normalization scale,

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.029
there'll be some
scale where we want

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:24.105
to match from QCD
onto SCET, and that's

00:04:24.105 --> 00:04:25.230
going to be the hard scale.

00:04:35.126 --> 00:04:36.940
So I'll call that scale mu h.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:43.820
So then something physical
has to set these other scales

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.790
in the picture,
and the next thing

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:51.050
that we need to talk about is
what we're going to measure.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.570
In principle, if you
collide e plus e minus

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.150
and you produce hadrons,
you could have lots

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:57.650
of different possibilities.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.380
In particular, you could
have not dijets but trijets,

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.650
so you could have a third
jet and made it from a gluon.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.560
And some kind of measurement
that we do on the final state

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.590
is going to restrict us to this
configuration with just two

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.790
jets.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:12.830
And the one we'll
talk about to start

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.460
is what's called hemisphere
invariant masses, which

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.670
we already mentioned earlier.

00:05:21.598 --> 00:05:23.390
So the way that you
should think about this

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.680
is you take all the
final state particles,

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.320
and you could just take the
sum of all their momenta

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.970
and divide it into two parts,
those that are in hemisphere A

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.410
and those that are
in hemisphere B.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:47.960
So let me augment my
figure here by saying

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.718
that there's two hemispheres.

00:05:51.718 --> 00:05:53.760
And then what these masses
are, which I'll call m

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:57.350
squared and then
bar squared are just

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.580
the four vectors squared for
p, for the a, and the b guy.

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.660
So written in terms of
the individual particles

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.200
in that hemisphere, you
sum up all their four

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.920
vectors for the particles in
that hemisphere and square it,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:30.050
and then likewise for B.

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:33.170
And if you're measuring
these two things,

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.060
we talked about earlier
the fact that you

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.250
could specify that it
was a jet by demanding

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.730
that they're small.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:45.990
So the dijets is
going to be m squared

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.908
and then bar squared
much less than q squared.

00:06:49.908 --> 00:06:52.200
And if you had trijets, you
wouldn't-- that wouldn't be

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.030
the case because
if you had trijets,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.760
you'd have two particle-- two
jets in this hemisphere at wide

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:01.520
angles, and those-- that wide
angle would produce a large q

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.350
squared, a large and
variant mass of m squared.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.830
That's of order q squared.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:08.770
But if you just
have a single jet,

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.970
then you can have
a small m squared,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.735
so the small m squared limit is
what forces you to have dijets.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.160
And these guys here,
it also puts us

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.850
in the kinematic situation
where we have our n collinear

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:27.330
modes for one jet and
n bar collinear modes

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.953
for the other jet.

00:07:29.953 --> 00:07:32.370
So those are two of the degrees
of freedom in our picture.

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:40.660
So I'm reminding you of some
things we talked about before,

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.280
but it was a while ago so--

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.857
and the power counting
parameter here is m over q.

00:07:47.857 --> 00:07:49.440
And so if you want
to say that there's

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.470
a scale in this picture
associated to the collinear

00:07:52.470 --> 00:07:57.000
modes, then you would say
it's on a kind of jet scale,

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.394
and that's of order m.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:08.860
OK, any questions so far?

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:17.360
So then there's the
ultra soft radiation,

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.900
which is being ultra
soft, it's uniform.

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:22.221
It's not collimated
in any direction.

00:08:25.562 --> 00:08:27.520
It's the thing that gives
you the communication

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.360
between the jets.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:35.710
The jets are going to decouple
from each other in the sense

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:38.539
that interactions directly
between the n collinear and n

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:42.270
bar collinear modes is all
going into the pink dot,

00:08:42.270 --> 00:08:45.280
but there can be long distance
communication between the jets

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.170
caused by the ultra soft modes.

00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:53.410
So, really, what I mean here
is long distance communication.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:55.810
Short distance communication
can happen too.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:59.350
That's what the pink dot is, but
that's, in some sense, simpler.

00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.940
Long distance
communication can only

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.630
happen by this ultra
soft radiation.

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:08.500
And we know about how
ultra soft radiation

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.180
interacts with
energetic particles,

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:13.060
and in particular, what we
know is that it's eikonal.

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:16.000
That came out of our
Lagrangian description

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.520
of ultra soft radiation.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:22.340
And that will have
implications here.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.950
So what is this
ultra soft radiation?

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:26.182
It's radiation that
has energy that's

00:09:26.182 --> 00:09:27.265
of order q lambda squared.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:36.010
And so that's m squared
over q energy radiation,

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:39.370
and so the soft scale,
which is the next scale down

00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:44.890
in the picture, ultra soft
scale, is m squared over q.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:47.590
Often, people will--
because there's

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:51.760
no soft radiation in this
setup, sometimes people

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.250
will just drop the ultra
and just call it soft.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.760
That's very common.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.810
I'll try to always
call it ultra soft here

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.750
because we'll be drawing
some distinctions with SCET 2

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.810
examples, and in those examples,
we have soft and collinear.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.120
In this example, we have
ultra soft and collinear,

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.520
so I'll keep trying
to call it ultra soft.

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.050
But you can see
that I've already

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.910
abbreviated it to
u soft to make it

00:10:12.910 --> 00:10:15.280
look more and more like soft.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.200
Anyway, but in the
literature, people

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.470
often just drop the u
completely and call it soft.

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.520
Something to be aware of.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.550
OK, so this actually--
this radiation here,

00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:30.040
this is kind of the
largest scale that

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:32.930
can show up in
the soft function,

00:10:32.930 --> 00:10:34.450
and there's also lambda QCD.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:41.470
And that's a scale
that, at least to start,

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:43.220
we're going to leave
in the soft function.

00:10:51.148 --> 00:10:53.190
So if we go back to our
picture over here, that's

00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.870
why I put both the ultra soft
mode side up on this hyperbola

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:03.210
there, which is this m
squared over q line, mu over m

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.800
squared over q line.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.810
That's why I made it
orange, and I also

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:10.320
made orange this lambda QCD
because they're together.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.480
And you can think of
it as just that there's

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:16.320
some modes that are capturing
this entire region, which

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.930
are the ultra soft modes.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:20.430
Now there are two--

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:25.500
if m squared over q was
of order lambda QCD, then

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.570
those are the same thing.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:29.190
So there's kind of two
possibilities here.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:35.250
You could have m squared
over q of order lambda QCD,

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.466
and that means that this
scale is not non-perturbative.

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.180
And this is what's
called, for reasons

00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:50.137
that will become apparent by the
end of lecture, the peak region

00:11:50.137 --> 00:11:52.470
because this is actually the
region of the cross section

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:53.952
where there's a peak.

00:11:53.952 --> 00:11:56.890
OK, that's why it's
called the peak region.

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.290
And in this region, you have
the following hierarchy.

00:12:01.290 --> 00:12:05.110
You have mu h is much
greater than mu j.

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.920
Mu j is much greater
than mu s, but mu

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.350
s is of order lambda QCD.

00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:15.590
OK, so if we take this
to always be true,

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:18.020
then we're in this situation.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.860
And there is
another possibility,

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.510
and that is that there's
really a separation

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:27.530
between these hyperbolas that's
just as large or hierarchical

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.030
as the previous separations.

00:12:30.030 --> 00:12:34.130
So if this thing is much
bigger than lambda QCD,

00:12:34.130 --> 00:12:37.370
that's another
possibility, and there'll

00:12:37.370 --> 00:12:39.260
be a region of phase
based where this is true

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.090
and a region of phase
based where this is true.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:43.340
The second one is--

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.430
here, the soft, there's--

00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:59.500
here there is perturbative
ultra soft radiation,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.960
so you can just calculate
it order by order

00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:05.860
in the ultra soft scale,
which is this scale, which

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:09.910
is perturbative because it's
much bigger than lambda QCD.

00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:11.740
And this is what's
called the tail region.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.030
And the analog of
this statement here

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:21.835
is that we have a hierarchy
between everybody.

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:36.840
So when we do this analysis,
what we're going to do

00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.190
is we're going to do
a power expansion.

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.580
And you can say, well,
the power expansion

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.600
is just what you told
me, m squared over--

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.060
m squared much less
than q squared,

00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.700
but you also have to worry
about this when you're

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.320
doing the power expansion.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.710
So one way of thinking
about it is just exactly

00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:56.490
as I'm writing here, and
that's how I want to advocate.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:59.683
The things you're expanding
in are these assumptions.

00:13:59.683 --> 00:14:01.350
And you can see that
in these two cases,

00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:03.000
there's a slightly
different set up.

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.110
So usually, when you
have an effective theory,

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:23.860
you have to define this from
the beginning because the way

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:27.340
you proceed and how you
set up your theory is going

00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:30.010
to depend on whether
you're in this situation

00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:32.260
or this situation.

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.560
But part of this story is the
same in these two situations,

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:38.000
namely the first two greater
thans, much greater thans

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.470
are the same.

00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:41.830
And so that, we can proceed
without worrying about this.

00:14:45.372 --> 00:14:47.330
And then we can make this
distinction later on,

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:49.038
and that's what my
picture was advocating

00:14:49.038 --> 00:14:56.167
for by having these guys
in the same category.

00:14:56.167 --> 00:14:57.250
So hopefully that's clear.

00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:17.590
OK, so if you're
in the tail region,

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:24.310
there's going to be
power corrections,

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:28.120
and these are actually the most
important power corrections

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:35.350
that come as powers of lambda
QCD over the soft scale

00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:36.040
to some power.

00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:42.220
But you're going to have
a power expansion in that.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.000
So that's the-- if you
like in this situation

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.500
when you're in the
tail region, you

00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:50.710
can have power corrections that
are non-perturbative by having

00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:52.330
ratios of these
things, lambda QCD

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:55.340
over this over that over this.

00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:58.966
But the biggest one are these
guys over the soft scale,

00:15:58.966 --> 00:16:00.700
so that's the next
smallest scale.

00:16:05.618 --> 00:16:07.410
But if you neglect
these, the leading order

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:09.750
cross section in this
region is perturbative.

00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:25.460
Now you know you can have any
power here, and those exist.

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.100
What happens in
the peak region is

00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:31.490
that thinking about those as
an expansion is no longer good.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.960
And you have to take all
of them and treat them

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.930
as if they're order
one and for any k,

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:50.368
and that ends up
meaning that there's

00:16:50.368 --> 00:16:52.160
going to be some
non-perturbative function,

00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.160
like a Parton distribution
function in the sense

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:58.490
that it's non-perturbative,
that describes part of what's

00:16:58.490 --> 00:17:04.800
going on here in this region.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.740
And that, we just see
from our power counting,

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.365
and our power counting
already tells us

00:17:08.365 --> 00:17:11.677
that that's what's
going to happen.

00:17:11.677 --> 00:17:13.260
So we can learn a
lot just by thinking

00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:16.030
about the scales and the problem
and thinking about the power

00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:16.530
counting.

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:32.463
So you could ask about
other power corrections.

00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:37.730
So there's a set of
power connections

00:17:37.730 --> 00:17:41.660
where you would expand
and say mu s over mu j.

00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:50.350
And let me label these as
kinematic because these--

00:17:50.350 --> 00:17:53.120
the things that setting
the scale for mu s and mu

00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.530
j, say in this picture
where mu s is this

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:00.280
and I always distinguished
lambda QCD as a separate thing,

00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:02.140
these scales are just
perturbative scales,

00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.670
and they just
correspond to if you

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:05.503
think about having some
function that you're

00:18:05.503 --> 00:18:08.150
making an expansion of it.

00:18:08.150 --> 00:18:09.670
So they come about
from expansion

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.380
of kinematic
variables basically.

00:18:19.846 --> 00:18:23.086
So it's the m squared
much less than q squared.

00:18:23.086 --> 00:18:27.320
So I mean, there's nothing
non-perturbative about that.

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.910
And then you could
have power corrections

00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:36.620
that are lambda QCD over
mu, which, if you like,

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.720
are really hard
power corrections.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.500
They're kind of a traditional
power corrections, which are

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.590
lambda QCD over the hard scale.

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:49.910
And the exercise that I gave
in the homework, in some sense,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:54.950
is going towards figuring out
what the sort of soft function

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.630
matrix elements would be.

00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:58.800
Part of the problem--
there's other parts to it--

00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.782
but would be going
towards figuring out

00:19:00.782 --> 00:19:02.990
what these guys actually
are and defining them, which

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.770
is not known in the literature.

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:12.680
And then finally, you could
have lambda QCD over mu j,

00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.150
which, of course,
you could write.

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:15.080
You have to be a
little bit careful

00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.120
because one way that
this could happen

00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:22.250
is that you just have one
of these guys times one

00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.230
of those guys.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.520
OK, so they're not--

00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.523
it's not necessarily an
independent category,

00:19:27.523 --> 00:19:29.690
but you could still think
about these types of power

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:33.170
corrections as kind of
something that might show up,

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:36.240
either this way or maybe
somewhat maybe directly.

00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:40.640
And anyway, that's
another category.

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.400
It turns out that kind of--

00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.100
you can get it this
way, which is something

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:47.930
that one can deal with.

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:51.380
And if it happens
directly, then it actually

00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:56.630
is down by two
powers, so these guys

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.159
are kind of less important.

00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:08.710
OK, so people deal with
these guys in the literature.

00:20:08.710 --> 00:20:11.950
These guys haven't really
been fully treated yet.

00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:14.000
Not very much is
known about them,

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.780
and this is fully treated
in the literature.

00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:22.230
These ones that I said are
the most important ones.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:24.690
OK, so even-- we can
already even outline

00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:28.377
kind of what people are
doing because we just

00:20:28.377 --> 00:20:30.210
think about higher order
terms of expansion,

00:20:30.210 --> 00:20:33.420
and this is an example,
unlike B to C decays,

00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:35.310
where we have people
going to four orders

00:20:35.310 --> 00:20:36.840
down in the expansion.

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:40.230
Here even the first non-trivial
order down hasn't really been

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:41.590
done--

00:20:41.590 --> 00:20:42.590
hasn't been done at all.

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.318
In the second, place
various expansions,

00:20:47.318 --> 00:20:48.360
so it's more complicated.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.030
And some of them have been
treated, but this one hasn't.

00:21:02.296 --> 00:21:05.280
And I should say that the
way that this one is treated

00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.487
is really just
perturbatively so it's not--

00:21:08.487 --> 00:21:10.320
this one, in some sense,
is also not treated

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.470
fully in the language
of the effective theory.

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.330
It's just put in by hand.

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.670
So in some sense, the only
one that's treated properly

00:21:21.670 --> 00:21:22.450
is the top one.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:32.610
OK, well, we're going to
work mostly to leading order,

00:21:32.610 --> 00:21:36.330
and we're going to call
these guys power corrections

00:21:36.330 --> 00:21:38.760
and work with this stuff.

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:50.730
OK, so start with the
full theory current.

00:21:50.730 --> 00:21:52.310
I'm not going to
distinguish too much

00:21:52.310 --> 00:21:55.460
between pieces that come from
charges, like the electrically

00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:56.720
charged and stuff like that.

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.460
That's not going to be
our main focus here.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.360
We can keep track of all that.

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.520
Our main focus is going to
be understanding the QCD

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.560
effects for the jets.

00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.120
So we've already done this.

00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:10.520
The current that
has a psi bar psi

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.570
gets matched in
SCET onto something

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.325
with two Wilson lines.

00:22:16.325 --> 00:22:17.075
There's the label.

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:26.870
There's another
label, and we can also

00:22:26.870 --> 00:22:28.568
make a field redefinition.

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:43.210
And let me not put
zeros on the field

00:22:43.210 --> 00:22:46.300
after the field redefinition
because that makes

00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.630
it notationally cumbersome.

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:54.640
So this goes to this after
making that field redefinition.

00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.560
OK, so this is something
we talked about earlier,

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:05.370
and the Wilson lines here
are capturing diagrams,

00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:08.040
as I said earlier,
where you could have,

00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.110
say, two n collinear
is one n bar,

00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:12.290
and then this guy is off shell.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:21.140
So that goes into a Wilson line
once you match it on to the--

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.685
so this is the
[? fall ?] theory.

00:23:22.685 --> 00:23:24.560
Once you match it on to
the effective theory,

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:28.053
you get various extra gluons
coming out of your operator,

00:23:28.053 --> 00:23:29.720
which is coming from
these Wilson lines,

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.580
and it's because
you're integrating off

00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:32.660
shell particles.

00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:39.290
So if you just look
at the kinematics,

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:43.520
then there's already
actually some fairly powerful

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:45.150
restrictions.

00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:47.390
We're in the center
of mass frame.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:24:00.763
Momentum conservation
says that if we

00:24:00.763 --> 00:24:03.180
think about all particles in
the final stages either being

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:11.520
n collinear or n bar
collinear for ultra soft,

00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.080
then the initial momentum of
the virtual photon or virtual C

00:24:16.080 --> 00:24:18.970
has to add up to all
the final stage momenta.

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:25.110
And if we just look at
the large part of that,

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:30.750
in the center of mass frame,
n bar dot q is just capital Q,

00:24:30.750 --> 00:24:34.560
and that's n bar dot pxn
plus things that are small.

00:24:37.270 --> 00:24:41.790
And likewise, n dot q
equals capital q equals

00:24:41.790 --> 00:24:46.540
n dot pxn bar, which is
large order one plus small.

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.290
So these guys here are lowest--

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:50.790
leading order in
the power counting,

00:24:50.790 --> 00:24:52.290
and these guys are suppressed.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.530
And what happens is
like in the example

00:24:59.530 --> 00:25:02.470
we talked about when we
were doing [? bs ?] gamma.

00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.060
We have these labels,
omega and omega

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:06.790
bar on our collinear
fields up there.

00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:10.060
They just get fixed to the
qs by momentum conservation.

00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:25.620
So I said this was
generically going

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:28.800
to happen whenever we had
operators that had only one

00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.070
type of building block
in each collinear sector,

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:34.800
and that's exactly
the situation we have.

00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.930
Some momentum conservation
is strong enough

00:25:36.930 --> 00:25:44.040
to fix that omega is equal
to q and so is omega bar.

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.940
So the first thing I
want to do is show you

00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.130
how to factorize to the
cross section in this case.

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:05.960
So what would you do in
QCD for this cross section?

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.690
Well, you'd say
the cross section

00:26:08.690 --> 00:26:12.020
is a sum over some restricted
set of final states

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:14.660
that satisfy the kinematic
criteria that I'm

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.350
interested in.

00:26:19.390 --> 00:26:22.480
You'd have a momentum
conserving delta function,

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.350
and you could write it
as sort of leptonic or--

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:31.270
yeah, leptonic tensor, and
then kind of a hadronic tensor,

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:40.380
the same way we
do for [? DIS. ?]

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.810
So you would start-- could
start with that formula, which

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:46.080
is really true for anything
that you might want to measure,

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.470
which is just imposed by kind
of what states you include here.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:58.560
And I haven't yet
specified exactly what

00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.730
I'm going to measure.

00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:02.850
We'll still have to put that in.

00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:06.270
So part of what SCET does
is make these restrictions

00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:08.463
into something that
shows up in the operators

00:27:08.463 --> 00:27:10.005
rather than showing
up in the states.

00:27:22.678 --> 00:27:24.970
And ideally, we'd like to
sort of get rid of the states

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:28.270
eventually and be
able to calculate--

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.780
see how to calculate things.

00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:35.620
So in SCET, once we know that
we're in a dijet configuration,

00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:37.960
we can think of
the state as having

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:43.000
been composed of sort of pieces
for the different sectors.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.580
And we know that this is an OK
picture because our Lagrangian

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:47.548
for these guys factored.

00:27:47.548 --> 00:27:49.090
And when the Lagrangian
factors, that

00:27:49.090 --> 00:28:01.040
means the Hamiltonian factors
and the Hilbert space factors

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.936
after the field redefinition.

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:16.092
OK, so we can put in our
expansion of the current

00:28:16.092 --> 00:28:17.550
at the top of the
board over there,

00:28:17.550 --> 00:28:21.640
and then put it into this
formula, and see what we get.

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:23.010
And there's some pre-factors.

00:28:27.210 --> 00:28:31.028
I'm now summing over
just these states.

00:28:31.028 --> 00:28:32.820
There are still some
restrictions depending

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:35.160
on what I'm measuring, but they
are different restrictions,

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.993
and they're simpler.

00:28:39.088 --> 00:28:41.130
There's still momentum
conserving delta function,

00:28:41.130 --> 00:28:47.160
but I can write it out as
pxn pxn bar px ultra soft.

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.090
And because of
the states factor,

00:28:52.090 --> 00:28:56.870
I can factor also with a little
bit of work the operators.

00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:59.350
So I can write the operators.

00:28:59.350 --> 00:29:00.370
I'll just write it down.

00:29:00.370 --> 00:29:02.470
I think it's clear.

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:07.430
And I'll tell you
some of the things

00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:08.597
you have to do to get there.

00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:35.740
So I am skipping some steps
here because if we do it--

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:38.710
we can do it very carefully,
and we come write out each step

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:40.183
one at a time.

00:29:40.183 --> 00:29:42.100
But there's a lot of
writing if one does that,

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:44.920
so I'm kind of
trying to write steps

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.940
where I think it's intuitive
what the results are

00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:52.990
and skip steps
that some level can

00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:58.210
be filled in either by
looking at the literature

00:29:58.210 --> 00:30:00.820
or you just believe me.

00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:04.840
So we have these operators
that were still tied together

00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.150
in some sense because there
is a color contraction

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:09.310
of an index between them.

00:30:09.310 --> 00:30:12.460
But we can get around that
basically using some--

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.670
once we realized that the matrix
elements factor like this,

00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.230
we can use some color identities
and put it in this form.

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:21.250
So there's an
overall pre-factor 1

00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:24.090
over nc, which I didn't write.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:25.690
There's some
overall pre-factors,

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:27.410
but the color is separate.

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:30.460
There's a trace, if you
like, over color here,

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:34.460
and these guys here are traced
into color singlets as well.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:37.340
Ray trace in each case.

00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:41.340
So just using some color
identities, we can do that.

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.028
So once-- remember the
fact that the states factor

00:30:44.028 --> 00:30:46.070
in that the operators can
be written in a product

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:48.650
means that all contractions are
happening between these guys

00:30:48.650 --> 00:30:49.275
and these guys.

00:30:49.275 --> 00:30:51.908
That's why I can separate the
matrix elements the way I have.

00:30:51.908 --> 00:30:53.450
And the only thing
is then that there

00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:55.492
could be color indices
tying these guys together,

00:30:55.492 --> 00:30:58.757
but it turns out you could
deal with that as well.

00:30:58.757 --> 00:31:00.340
When you deal with
the color theories,

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.860
you could get things like--
you could get a ta in here or--

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:07.260
well, you could get, for
example, ta ta or something,

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.440
but then there's
some ways of getting

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:14.072
rid of those terms related to
the fact that this has to be--

00:31:14.072 --> 00:31:16.820
you have to argue that certain
things are color singlets.

00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:18.930
I'm not going to
go through that.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:20.690
So there's terms that
we're dropping here,

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:24.290
and those are the
other high order--

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:28.140
those are the other
power corrections.

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.440
So this keeps all the power
corrections of the first type,

00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.830
mu s, lambda QCD over mu
s because those can still

00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:37.230
be encoded in our
soft function, which

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:41.820
is going to be this thing
involving the soft states.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.310
But it drops the other
power corrections.

00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:46.083
AUDIENCE: How do you
know that since you

00:31:46.083 --> 00:31:48.120
derived the
[INAUDIBLE] by looking

00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:51.500
at the perturbative diagrams?

00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.945
PROFESSOR: No, I didn't.

00:31:53.945 --> 00:31:55.235
I can derive--

00:31:55.235 --> 00:31:57.110
I don't need to look at
perturbative diagrams

00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:58.540
to draw the Wilson lines.

00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.560
I just derived them
from the SCET Lagrangian

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:04.371
by making the
field redefinition.

00:32:04.371 --> 00:32:07.260
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
that because the Langrangian

00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:11.250
decoupled, that's good for all--

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:12.915
PROFESSOR: All soft particles.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.300
So far, we actually
haven't needed

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:23.430
to use perturbation
theory, and the idea here

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:25.680
is that we're not going to
use perturbation theory.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.240
We're going to write
down some formula that's

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.990
true to all orders in
perturbation theory,

00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:32.550
and we're really only
trading the power expansion.

00:32:32.550 --> 00:32:34.860
That's what we're
focusing on here

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.377
without thinking about things
as perturbative things.

00:32:37.377 --> 00:32:39.210
Although, obviously,
some of these functions

00:32:39.210 --> 00:32:40.620
will be perturbative
functions that we

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:41.912
will end up wanting to compute.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.810
OK, so let's think about
what res prime means.

00:32:49.810 --> 00:32:53.490
And it's really a reminder
that this formula is only

00:32:53.490 --> 00:32:59.700
really valid if we're
making a measurement

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:03.285
on the final state that really
puts us in this configuration.

00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:11.477
So it's not enough to say
we are in this situation.

00:33:11.477 --> 00:33:13.810
You're going to have to measure
something that makes you

00:33:13.810 --> 00:33:19.160
in that dijet configuration, and
that's important to remember.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.630
And so we're going to measure
the hemisphere invariant

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:26.510
masses.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:28.780
So we need to cook
that into our formula,

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:31.540
and there's a very
easy way of doing that.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.570
We say that the
following is true.

00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:39.070
I can write one, which is
equal to an integral of two

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:39.970
delta functions.

00:33:49.590 --> 00:33:51.210
And this formula
is obviously true.

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:02.670
And then what I'm
going to do is I'm

00:34:02.670 --> 00:34:04.530
going to instead of
integrating this,

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:07.162
I'm going to move it as
a d sigma d these things,

00:34:07.162 --> 00:34:09.120
and that's going to leave
these delta functions

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.889
inside the formula here.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:13.800
But since they depend on
collinear and soft momenta,

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.830
which are the momenta
that are in these states,

00:34:16.830 --> 00:34:18.840
they're going to be sort
of tightly connected

00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:22.290
to the whole thing, whatever
is going on in this formula.

00:34:22.290 --> 00:34:24.742
It's not like they
commute with this xn.

00:34:24.742 --> 00:34:26.159
They only commute
with the xn if I

00:34:26.159 --> 00:34:28.534
can make them into the identity
by integrating over this.

00:34:28.534 --> 00:34:31.500
But once I pull this
through and put it over

00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:32.530
on the right hand side--

00:34:32.530 --> 00:34:35.174
left hand side, then you have
to leave these delta functions

00:34:35.174 --> 00:34:35.730
there.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:37.439
They're specifying
the measurement.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:47.699
So this is a total n
collinear momentum,

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:54.819
and this is the total
ultra soft in hemisphere A.

00:34:54.819 --> 00:34:57.480
That's what the A means.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.840
So I divided everything into
hemisphere A and B. Obviously,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.340
all the n collinear
particles, which

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.860
are going in that direction,
are in that hemisphere,

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:06.940
but the soft ones could
go in either case.

00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:09.690
And so then there's a soft
momentum in hemisphere B

00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:15.240
and soft momentum in hemisphere
A. Now this is unexpanded.

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:20.720
I can also expand
these delta functions,

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.418
and I only need to keep the
leading order piece if we're

00:35:23.418 --> 00:35:24.460
working at leading order.

00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:40.570
And so the leading order
pieces are as follows.

00:35:40.570 --> 00:35:43.410
There's an order of
lambda squared piece.

00:35:43.410 --> 00:35:44.383
This is lambda squared.

00:35:44.383 --> 00:35:46.050
There's an order of
lambda squared piece

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.950
from the collinear
momentum squared,

00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:50.220
and since this is a
total collinear momentum,

00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.050
it can involve multiple
massless particles.

00:35:52.050 --> 00:35:53.610
It doesn't have to be zero.

00:35:53.610 --> 00:35:56.040
And then there's a cross
term between the softs

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:56.790
and the collinear.

00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:58.082
It's also order lambda squared.

00:35:58.082 --> 00:36:00.440
This order one.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.850
And this is order
lambda squared,

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:04.293
and that term's the same size.

00:36:04.293 --> 00:36:06.210
And then all the other
terms are higher order.

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:11.560
These terms are suppressed,
so this is really

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:12.970
all I need to keep.

00:36:12.970 --> 00:36:17.620
There's also something
else that effectively we've

00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.448
done by setting things up,
and that is, in general, you

00:36:20.448 --> 00:36:22.990
could think that the collinear
particles would have some perp

00:36:22.990 --> 00:36:24.070
momentum.

00:36:24.070 --> 00:36:27.650
But we aligned our
axes with the jet axis,

00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:30.190
so there's actually no
perp momentum there either.

00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:33.550
So that guy is really just--

00:36:33.550 --> 00:36:45.620
we can pull out a pn minus and
then we have pn plus k sa plus.

00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:49.970
And we also know
that pn minus is q.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:52.100
That was fixed by kinematics.

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.640
OK, so this simplifies
quite a bit.

00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.840
And we're going to drop all the
powers of [INAUDIBLE] terms.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.770
All right, so that is one thing.

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:28.660
So then I can do what I said
in words, write this guy,

00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:34.930
and it will have
these two deltas that

00:37:34.930 --> 00:37:37.850
are under similar acts.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:40.210
They don't commute through
with it-- without it.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:43.010
They depend on x.

00:37:43.010 --> 00:37:46.210
Now another thing
we would like to do

00:37:46.210 --> 00:37:50.560
is the factorize
the measurement.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.090
So this measurement
here involves

00:37:52.090 --> 00:37:55.630
the sum of a plus momentum
collinear and a plus momentum

00:37:55.630 --> 00:37:57.340
in soft.

00:37:57.340 --> 00:37:58.810
And it's all in
one delta function.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:00.852
We'd like to write it as
separate delta functions

00:38:00.852 --> 00:38:03.760
that we can associate with
those different parts here,

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.150
one delta-- we'd like to
have a separate thing here

00:38:07.150 --> 00:38:08.560
from these guys.

00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.880
And that's actually
very easy to do.

00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:16.596
We simply write the following.

00:38:27.530 --> 00:38:29.632
Just introduce some
more delta functions.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.270
So there's this tying
together delta function.

00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.960
K plus is just some
dummy variable.

00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.580
It's not the momentum
of any state.

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:54.340
It's just a dummy variable,
whereas pn plus and ksa plus

00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:57.560
were momenta of
particles in the state.

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.340
So this guy can then
associate with the--

00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:11.100
put them together with the
n collinear matrix element,

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:12.150
which is this guy here.

00:39:15.454 --> 00:39:17.040
I forget what color he was.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:27.360
And then for the
ultra soft, we can

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:29.730
associated this delta function.

00:39:32.123 --> 00:39:33.540
So that's what I
mean by factoring

00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.332
the measurement, that
we can put the piece,

00:39:35.332 --> 00:39:36.990
depended on the state, together.

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:39.810
And then you can see
that we can move our--

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.660
well, OK, we have to also
factor this delta function.

00:39:42.660 --> 00:39:45.360
I should say that too.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.760
That's the part that I'm
not going to go through,

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:53.100
but we can play similar
games expanding and factoring

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:56.250
this delta four as well.

00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:59.730
And that's besides just
being a little bit tedious,

00:39:59.730 --> 00:40:04.970
it's not really any
more difficult. Maybe

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:07.440
a little more difficult.

00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:08.660
So we factor that guy too.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:17.900
And then there's one other
trick that we want to do,

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:23.320
which is useful, and
that is that we can write

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.910
some deltas in Fourier's space.

00:40:37.135 --> 00:40:38.760
So we can always
write a delta function

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:42.750
as an integral over a
phase, and that's convenient

00:40:42.750 --> 00:40:44.677
because in the phase,
the momenta that

00:40:44.677 --> 00:40:46.260
are in the delta
function also factor.

00:40:49.930 --> 00:40:52.870
So I can write it as a product
of two separate factors

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:53.410
like this.

00:40:56.002 --> 00:40:58.150
There's some halves.

00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:01.060
It's conventional.

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:05.230
OK, so this guy here,
which is the guy that

00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:07.150
is associated to
the state, it looks

00:41:07.150 --> 00:41:09.250
like a translation operator.

00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:13.960
if you have an e to the i
x dot p, that you can use.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.030
You can put into
your matrix element,

00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:19.000
and you can translate
the fields, which

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.802
are in this formula all at 0.

00:41:21.802 --> 00:41:25.000
They're all at space time 0.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.370
What you can do
with this guy here

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:31.300
is you can put it into
the matrix element

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:33.790
and translate the
fields to point x.

00:41:45.037 --> 00:41:49.240
And then you'd have
a chi and x minus.

00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.910
So that's how we can
deal with that guy.

00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:55.570
And so if we do a bunch
of stuff like that I'm not

00:41:55.570 --> 00:41:58.870
going to go through on the
board for you, after some work,

00:41:58.870 --> 00:42:02.200
we get something just kind
of an intermediate step

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:10.260
of our factorization,
which I'll write out

00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.320
so you can get some idea of--

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:16.140
if I jump to the final answer,
it's kind of too simple

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.850
to see what's going on.

00:42:18.850 --> 00:42:20.460
So let's write this one out.

00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.423
So I was focusing on the n
collinear matrix element,

00:42:36.423 --> 00:42:38.840
and everything I was writing,
I wrote this delta function.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.540
But there's, of course, another
one for the delta n bar,

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:43.850
and I do the same thing for him.

00:42:43.850 --> 00:42:46.740
So we got k plus and l plus
by factoring the measurement

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:47.240
there.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:49.310
You get a k minus and
an l minus by factoring

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:50.495
the other measurement.

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.880
One thing that comes into--

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.060
that makes this guy here
a little more complicated

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.477
is you have to think a little
bit about residual and label

00:43:10.477 --> 00:43:11.420
momentum.

00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:16.640
But at the end of the day, the
result is what I'm writing.

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:43.640
So this is going to be
completely factorizing to three

00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:44.495
independent things.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.900
There's one set of collinear
fields for the quark,

00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.830
and there's another for
the antiquark if you like.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:11.480
You're specifying
whether it's a quark

00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:13.290
or an antiquark with a label.

00:44:13.290 --> 00:44:16.350
So the fact that this
label here is positive

00:44:16.350 --> 00:44:20.298
means that this is a quark, and
maybe this should be a minus q.

00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:31.538
And then this guy is
specifying the antiquark,

00:44:31.538 --> 00:44:32.830
and then there's the soft part.

00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:10.760
OK, so this is a fairly
messy one board expression,

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:14.140
but this guy here is factored.

00:45:14.140 --> 00:45:16.570
We have the hard modes
here, collinear modes,

00:45:16.570 --> 00:45:19.450
n collinear here, and
bar collinear there,

00:45:19.450 --> 00:45:26.920
and the ultra soft goes
here, which I've already

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:30.100
dropped in my ultra soft.

00:45:30.100 --> 00:45:35.020
So this last guy if you think
about what this matrix element

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:39.090
is it's just some function.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:40.268
We sum over all x of this.

00:45:40.268 --> 00:45:42.060
So we sum over all the
intermediate states.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:44.185
The only thing we're fixing
are l plus and l minus.

00:45:48.555 --> 00:45:50.180
So when we sum over
states, we actually

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.990
integrate the momentum
of particles in the state

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:54.090
if you can think of that.

00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:55.010
Those are different states.

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:57.427
You have to sum over them too,
but it's a continuous label

00:45:57.427 --> 00:46:01.467
and therefore you integrate
over the phase base.

00:46:01.467 --> 00:46:03.800
And that's what we mean when
we write the sum over axis.

00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:06.025
That includes phase
based intervals.

00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.890
And so the only--
so this momentum

00:46:10.890 --> 00:46:12.990
gets integrated
over if you like,

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:15.570
but then it gets--
there's a component that

00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.960
gets fixed, which is the total
momentum of plus or minus

00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.055
momentum in each hemisphere.

00:46:21.055 --> 00:46:22.305
So this is just some function.

00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:34.880
So that we color the same.

00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:41.367
It's just some function
of l plus or l minus,

00:46:41.367 --> 00:46:42.700
and it's called a soft function.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.220
And at this stage
of the game, it's

00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:53.905
actually encoding two
different momentum scales.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:01.600
The l plus and minus
as well as sort

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:03.790
of lambda QCD, which I
didn't write explicitly

00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:04.420
as an argument.

00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:11.230
And l plus and
minus, well, we'll

00:47:11.230 --> 00:47:14.260
see later, but you can
think of l plus and minus

00:47:14.260 --> 00:47:19.210
roughly as encoding the scale
that's m squared over q.

00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:22.180
This will become more
clear in a minute.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:30.181
So again, we need to figure
out what these guys here are.

00:47:30.181 --> 00:47:32.830
That's a little bit more
work but not too much.

00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:41.270
And they're both, of course,
mirrors of each other.

00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:44.560
So really, we just have to be
one of them, and if you like,

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:47.238
the other is just kind
of charge congregation.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:59.170
So this guy here, we're going
to write in Fourier's space.

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:09.530
That's a convenient
thing to do because what

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.870
we know about the Feynman
rules in Fourier's space

00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:13.580
when we thought about
the Feynman rules

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.690
in Fourier's space, we knew that
the collinear propagators would

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:20.520
only depend on the
small plus momentum.

00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:23.270
So the x-coordinates
here, the x-coordinates

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:25.840
of our fields,
those corresponded

00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:30.020
to residual momenta, but
when we do Feynman diagrams,

00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:32.720
there's only the plus
momentum showing up.

00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:34.250
That's the multipole expansion.

00:48:39.248 --> 00:48:41.540
So you could think about it
from the [? phonographs, ?]

00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:44.060
but it's really a
general property

00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.490
from the multipole expansion.

00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:54.260
So that means that some of these
integrals here are just trivial

00:48:54.260 --> 00:48:55.550
and give me a delta function.

00:48:59.805 --> 00:49:02.180
So I'm getting delta functions
in some directions because

00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:05.015
of the multipole
expansion in this formula.

00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:14.460
Because I aligned
the axis, there

00:49:14.460 --> 00:49:17.210
was no perpendicular momentum,
so it's really just this r plus

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:19.710
that we get, and this thing
here is called the jet function.

00:49:24.602 --> 00:49:26.810
So this is the non-trivial
function that can show up.

00:49:31.190 --> 00:49:32.300
We do the same thing.

00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:38.480
We do the same thing for the
case with the sum over xn bar,

00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:42.530
and it gives us
another jet function.

00:49:42.530 --> 00:49:47.390
And by charge conjugation,
it's the same jet function.

00:49:47.390 --> 00:49:53.200
But in this case, it would
be q of sum r prime minus

00:49:53.200 --> 00:49:55.880
and some other momentum.

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.760
And so what we then do
is we take this formula,

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:03.560
plug it back into here, do all
the integrals, and at the end

00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:05.330
of the day, we can actually do--

00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:08.000
we have lots of delta functions
and lots of integrals.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.770
And we can boil everything
down to just two integrals left

00:50:10.770 --> 00:50:11.270
over.

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:21.810
And that gives us our final
result. So I'll write this way.

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:42.800
So it boils down
to just involving

00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.845
these jet functions
and the soft function,

00:50:44.845 --> 00:50:46.220
and then there's
something that's

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:50.330
called the hard function, which
is just our Wilson coefficient

00:50:50.330 --> 00:50:50.985
squared.

00:50:50.985 --> 00:50:52.610
So rather than write
Wilson coefficient

00:50:52.610 --> 00:50:56.300
squared all the time, we just
call it another function h.

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.430
So this is the
factorization theorem.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.790
So you see in this case,
the hard function was just

00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:04.520
a multiplicative
factor unlike dis,

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.653
and what was-- where things
are talking to each other.

00:51:07.653 --> 00:51:09.320
Again, things are
talking to each other,

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:10.760
but it's the soft modes--

00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:13.370
ultra soft modes that
are talking to the jets.

00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:16.250
And ultra soft momenta
can change the mass,

00:51:16.250 --> 00:51:19.460
and that's what kind
of the correct mass--

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:20.900
this is the total mass.

00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:23.840
The correct mass for the jet
function is the collinear mass,

00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.637
and that's this thing
minus this thing.

00:51:25.637 --> 00:51:28.220
So if you wanted to guess this
formula, this is how you do it.

00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.800
You'd say m squared, just
from the kinematic relation,

00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:34.212
m squared had a collinear
piece and a soft piece.

00:51:34.212 --> 00:51:36.170
The right thing to evaluate
the jet function at

00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:40.050
would be just the collinear,
so that's the difference.

00:51:40.050 --> 00:51:43.340
And then the soft function
could depend on these momentum,

00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.580
and you're basically led
to a formula like this one.

00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:48.560
But we can also just,
with the field theory,

00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.060
go through and
derive it, and that's

00:51:50.060 --> 00:51:53.600
what I'm convincing you of even
if I was skipping some steps.

00:51:56.860 --> 00:51:59.200
All right, so this is the
dijet factorization theorem

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:01.855
for hemisphere invariant masses.

00:52:06.880 --> 00:52:08.920
And a lot of event
shapes kind of

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:11.555
go along the pattern
that we've done here.

00:52:11.555 --> 00:52:13.930
If you think about what would
be the difference if I pick

00:52:13.930 --> 00:52:16.870
some other observable both
sides of these masses,

00:52:16.870 --> 00:52:19.930
pick some other thing that you
could measure that would tell

00:52:19.930 --> 00:52:23.350
you that there's dijets, we just
swap out the measurement part,

00:52:23.350 --> 00:52:26.470
and that would lead to-- and
just see where it leads us.

00:52:26.470 --> 00:52:30.068
A lot of the steps would
be exactly the same steps.

00:52:30.068 --> 00:52:31.860
So we did it for one
particular observable,

00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:35.260
but steps are the
same if you do others.

00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.980
If you're in this situation
where you have dijets,

00:52:41.980 --> 00:52:44.740
there's more than one
way of measuring an event

00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:46.300
to ensure you have dijets.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:52.780
There's something called
dijet event shapes.

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:54.740
They go under the names
of things like thrust,

00:52:54.740 --> 00:52:57.460
C parameter, heavy jet mass.

00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.423
All these things actually
have factorization theorems

00:53:03.423 --> 00:53:05.590
that you could derive in a
similar way to what we're

00:53:05.590 --> 00:53:06.100
doing here.

00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:12.860
All right, now this
is kind of like--

00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.540
I didn't put any
mus in, but just

00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:17.850
like we did before, we
can always put the mus in.

00:53:17.850 --> 00:53:21.050
So if we put the mus
in, everybody gets a mu.

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:24.020
The h is like the mu of
the Wilson coefficient,

00:53:24.020 --> 00:53:25.460
and then the Js are like--

00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:27.645
and Ss are like mus of--

00:53:27.645 --> 00:53:29.270
from the point of
view of SCET, they're

00:53:29.270 --> 00:53:30.593
like mus of the operator.

00:53:30.593 --> 00:53:32.510
We're just switching to
renormalized operators

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:34.494
and renormalized
Wilson coefficients.

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:42.740
Now if we draw our
scale diagram again

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:47.300
but draw it a little
bigger this time

00:53:47.300 --> 00:53:49.820
and put in where these
various functions are--

00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:02.956
so somebody was blue.

00:54:11.530 --> 00:54:13.050
Not going to label
everybody again.

00:54:15.710 --> 00:54:17.290
So this is the hard function.

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:20.120
Our jet functions are kind
of sitting at this scale.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:22.360
They had to do with
the collinear modes,

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:25.870
and then our soft function is
sitting at this scale or this

00:54:25.870 --> 00:54:27.512
and this scale.

00:54:27.512 --> 00:54:29.845
So it's clear that these
things sit at different scales.

00:54:36.935 --> 00:54:39.310
And what that means from the
point of view of the formula

00:54:39.310 --> 00:54:44.670
is that if you associate
what scale these things want

00:54:44.670 --> 00:54:47.790
to live at, which from the point
of view of perturbation theory

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:51.030
means at what scale
should I expect-- would I

00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:52.680
be able to calculate
these things given

00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:53.470
that they're perturbative?

00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:55.178
Would I be able to
calculate these things

00:54:55.178 --> 00:54:57.150
without encountering
large logarithms?

00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:00.580
And that would be these
scales that I'm writing here.

00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:04.560
So these are the
scales where we could

00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:07.980
do perturbative theory
for the functions

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:10.950
without encountering
large logarithms.

00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:13.380
So we can figure out
what these skills

00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:15.330
are by just looking at
the perturbative theory

00:55:15.330 --> 00:55:16.580
and looking at the logarithms.

00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:28.340
But you see that it's a
different scale for each

00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:29.480
of the different functions.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:36.590
So in this formula,
there's a common mu, which

00:55:36.590 --> 00:55:38.570
is like a factorization scale.

00:55:38.570 --> 00:55:41.060
But each of the functions wants
to live at a different mu,

00:55:41.060 --> 00:55:43.393
and we're going to have to
do some renormalization group

00:55:43.393 --> 00:55:46.520
evolution to put things at
kind of at the scales they

00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:47.430
want to be at.

00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:49.820
And then there'll be some
resummation going on,

00:55:49.820 --> 00:55:53.610
and that's going to sum logs
of m squared over q squared.

00:55:53.610 --> 00:56:05.910
So we need normalization
group, and that's

00:56:05.910 --> 00:56:15.870
trying to sum up
logarithms, which

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:17.570
are ratios of
these scales, which

00:56:17.570 --> 00:56:19.940
expressed in terms of
some physical thing

00:56:19.940 --> 00:56:23.340
is, in this case, logs of
m squared over q squared.

00:56:28.380 --> 00:56:35.767
All right, what about
this situation here?

00:56:35.767 --> 00:56:36.600
Well, it turns out--

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:42.580
and I won't go into
it in too much detail,

00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:45.130
but we can factor that guy.

00:56:45.130 --> 00:56:46.660
If these two are
hierarchical, we

00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:51.940
can actually factor
this in something called

00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:56.930
the soft function OPE, and even
if they're not hierarchical,

00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:59.762
we can actually write
it in the following way.

00:56:59.762 --> 00:57:01.720
So we can always, in some
sense, whether or not

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.820
we're in a situation
where these are comparable

00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.920
or whether they're
hierarchical, we can always

00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:07.900
use the following formula.

00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:13.490
We're not guaranteed
that that is possible,

00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:17.050
but in this situation, it
is possible to sort of make

00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:19.430
those two situations
compatible with each other

00:57:19.430 --> 00:57:21.850
with a single formula.

00:57:21.850 --> 00:57:23.740
Usually, when you design
effective theories,

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:26.470
you kind of for each
different expansion,

00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:29.170
you have a different
result. And making them--

00:57:29.170 --> 00:57:32.618
whether you can put them
together into a single result

00:57:32.618 --> 00:57:33.660
is not always guaranteed.

00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.993
But this is a situation where
we can put things together

00:57:35.993 --> 00:57:38.170
in a single result
where these are

00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:45.740
the perturbative part
of the soft function,

00:57:45.740 --> 00:57:49.625
and this is the non-perturbative
lambda QCD effects.

00:57:54.110 --> 00:57:56.450
If you imagine that the
function-- if you imagine

00:57:56.450 --> 00:57:59.300
that these two axes
are hierarchical,

00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:04.130
then this perturbative guy here
gives you some ls corrections,

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:06.890
and it basically, in
terms of the l plus,

00:58:06.890 --> 00:58:09.110
in terms of the momentum
variable in this formula,

00:58:09.110 --> 00:58:12.240
it's giving something that's,
like, a power-- what's called

00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:14.270
the power law tail.

00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:17.120
So the kind of dependence
that you're getting in

00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:26.420
is some logs over an
l plus, and that's

00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:31.730
called a power law since
it goes like 1 over l plus,

00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:34.550
whereas these effects here
that are non-perturbative

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:37.310
live down at
non-perturbative momenta,

00:58:37.310 --> 00:58:42.590
and you can actually prove that
they have an exponential tail.

00:58:47.110 --> 00:58:51.430
So this is some plot of f in
a one dimensional projection,

00:58:51.430 --> 00:58:53.980
so let's just
think of it as one.

00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:56.800
And this is some scale
of order lambda QCD.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.950
So at some blob down
lambda QCD, this

00:58:59.950 --> 00:59:03.820
describing the distribution
of soft hadrons,

00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:05.410
and it's non-perturbative.

00:59:05.410 --> 00:59:08.450
It's not like I'm drawing
it because I know it.

00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:11.680
So it looks something like
this, whereas this part, we

00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:13.977
can calculate and it has
a different dependence.

00:59:13.977 --> 00:59:14.810
This is a power law.

00:59:14.810 --> 00:59:16.384
This is an exponential.

00:59:20.650 --> 00:59:23.290
OK, so that's kind of
further factorization

00:59:23.290 --> 00:59:27.535
of the s and to get rid to
make those two axis separated.

00:59:27.535 --> 00:59:29.080
Can separate the
perturbative and

00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:33.190
non-perturbative corrections.

00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:34.870
In some sense, if
you're in a situation

00:59:34.870 --> 00:59:39.010
where they're comparable,
then whether you

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:42.065
take a non-perturbative
function and if l plus is small

00:59:42.065 --> 00:59:43.690
and you integrated
against this, you're

00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:46.370
just getting back some other
non-perturbative function.

00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:48.055
So this formula is not really--

00:59:48.055 --> 00:59:50.680
there are some things that this
formula is actually doing, even

00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:53.200
in that situation, is ensuring
that you're in the ms bar

00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:53.992
scheme for example.

00:59:57.130 --> 01:00:02.230
But the sort of more
important in some ways

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:04.360
is when they're
hierarchical, and then you

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.850
can start to expand
this thing and--

01:00:06.850 --> 01:00:08.620
because in that case,
this l plus prime

01:00:08.620 --> 01:00:11.680
would be localized down here,
and the l plus-- if the l plus

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:14.140
got big, then you can start
doing a Taylor series,

01:00:14.140 --> 01:00:16.720
and this formula would
tell you what the-- how

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.280
to put the corrections together.

01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.700
So there's kind of a lot
of physics in that formula

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:28.760
that I'm not going
into in detail.

01:00:32.010 --> 01:00:32.715
Yeah.

01:00:32.715 --> 01:00:37.440
AUDIENCE: So I don't
really totally understand

01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.960
why this is valid.

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:42.960
Are you allowed to-- does the
soft function code all those

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.750
below that hyperbola?

01:00:44.750 --> 01:00:45.510
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:46.302
AUDIENCE: Is that--

01:00:46.302 --> 01:00:47.660
PROFESSOR: That's right.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.330
Below the above one and--

01:00:49.330 --> 01:00:50.600
AUDIENCE: Yeah, below the s.

01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:51.950
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:52.492
That's right.

01:00:52.492 --> 01:00:53.360
The soft function.

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:55.310
You should always
think of these things

01:00:55.310 --> 01:01:01.680
as kind of extending down to the
axes in some kind of fashion.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:02.900
So let's drop like this.

01:01:05.810 --> 01:01:08.568
Since they're infrared modes
and the infrared is sort of

01:01:08.568 --> 01:01:10.610
down at the axis, you
should always think of them

01:01:10.610 --> 01:01:11.990
as extending down to the axis.

01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:18.500
Now exactly how you want to
think about how the soft modes

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.470
and whether the soft modes
are capturing the entire axis

01:01:22.470 --> 01:01:24.030
or the collinear--
how the collinear

01:01:24.030 --> 01:01:27.630
modes and the soft mouths
kind of what the edges are

01:01:27.630 --> 01:01:29.070
is related to the
power counting.

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:31.080
And you can think of
the collinear modes

01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.510
as kind of being held
away from the axis

01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:36.270
because the soft modes are
really deeper in the infrared.

01:01:36.270 --> 01:01:40.050
AUDIENCE: But at higher power,
are you going to screw these up

01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:44.550
if you say-- like suppose the
soft modes have an invariant

01:01:44.550 --> 01:01:48.217
mass of lambda to the
fifth, right, or they're--

01:01:48.217 --> 01:01:49.050
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah.

01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:53.400
No, that's-- you never
have to worry about--

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.500
you could worry about putting
in more hyperbolas, right,

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:58.535
with lambda QCD
over q or something.

01:01:58.535 --> 01:01:59.160
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:00.210
PROFESSOR: And you
don't have to do that.

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:00.930
AUDIENCE: OK, so--

01:02:00.930 --> 01:02:01.980
PROFESSOR: You never
have to do that.

01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:02.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:03.840
Why is that?

01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.750
PROFESSOR: I mean, essentially,
that's because those--

01:02:06.750 --> 01:02:09.540
any lambda QCDs,
what this x means

01:02:09.540 --> 01:02:13.140
is that lambda QCD is encoded
in the soft-- in this kind

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:14.910
of non-perturbative soft mode.

01:02:14.910 --> 01:02:19.830
And if you had something that at
higher powers like lambda QCD,

01:02:19.830 --> 01:02:22.560
to take your example,
to the sixth,

01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:26.010
the one over q to the
sixth is going to come out

01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:27.540
in some coefficient.

01:02:27.540 --> 01:02:29.488
And the lambda QCD
to the sixth is just

01:02:29.488 --> 01:02:31.530
going to be some matrix
element of this mode that

01:02:31.530 --> 01:02:33.810
has that dimension.

01:02:33.810 --> 01:02:36.980
That's how it's going to work.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.057
So in some sense,
you could say, well,

01:02:39.057 --> 01:02:40.390
what if I put a mode down there?

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:42.340
And I would just say, well,
that mode's inside this mode.

01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:44.757
You don't have to write down
something different for that.

01:02:44.757 --> 01:02:47.590
It's all encoded in the
Lagrangian for that mode,

01:02:47.590 --> 01:02:49.735
and that mode has all the
non-perturbative physics.

01:02:57.313 --> 01:02:58.730
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
at a higher power,

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:00.365
I would think you're comparing--

01:03:00.365 --> 01:03:01.470
PROFESSOR: So this is--

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.980
AUDIENCE: --two powers by--

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.205
PROFESSOR: Yeah, this
is a good question.

01:03:03.205 --> 01:03:03.660
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:04.460
PROFESSOR: Right, so--

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.555
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] actually
significantly much smaller.

01:03:05.555 --> 01:03:09.170
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so one way of
thinking about it is like this.

01:03:09.170 --> 01:03:10.880
When you design the
effective theory,

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.338
you actually have to figure
out what the degrees of freedom

01:03:13.338 --> 01:03:14.790
are at lowest order.

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:16.490
And when you go to
higher order, you

01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:19.590
shouldn't be having new degrees
of freedom popping up at you.

01:03:19.590 --> 01:03:23.900
Yeah, and so that's kind
of at the heart of what

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:24.890
I'm saying here.

01:03:24.890 --> 01:03:29.927
That's a kind of an even
deeper way of saying it

01:03:29.927 --> 01:03:32.510
because what you're doing with
the power connections is you're

01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:34.882
kind of figuring out how to
put factors in the numerator

01:03:34.882 --> 01:03:36.590
if you want to think
in Feynman diagrams.

01:03:36.590 --> 01:03:37.880
You're not changing
the propagators.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:38.920
You've already figured
out the propagators

01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:40.860
with your leading order theory.

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:43.610
So you have sort of where
all the poles can occur,

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.890
and now you're just sort of
doing perturbation theory.

01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:47.515
Perturbation theory
shouldn't introduce

01:03:47.515 --> 01:03:50.030
new degrees of freedom in the--

01:03:50.030 --> 01:03:54.510
when you're expanding
in the power expansion.

01:03:54.510 --> 01:03:58.778
All right, so to
draw a picture, I

01:03:58.778 --> 01:04:01.320
want to tell you about one other
observable, which is thrust.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:16.080
So thrust can be
defined by this formula

01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.530
here in general,
which is that you

01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:21.330
find some axis,
which is actually

01:04:21.330 --> 01:04:22.440
an axis that's going to--

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:26.595
in our dijet configuration
in the jet axis.

01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:32.470
You find the axis that
maximizes this thing,

01:04:32.470 --> 01:04:34.710
and in the case of a
dijet configuration,

01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:36.990
that's going to align
with the jet axis.

01:04:36.990 --> 01:04:40.050
And then you do this sum, and
that calculate some variable t.

01:04:43.770 --> 01:04:47.400
T turns out to have kinematic
limits between a half and one,

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:50.463
and if you want to talk
about something that's

01:04:50.463 --> 01:04:52.380
a little more convenient,
you define something

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:55.140
called tau, which is 1 minus t.

01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:59.850
And the dijet limit
of tau is zero.

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:01.120
That's why this is more.

01:05:01.120 --> 01:05:02.940
So the dijet limit
of t is the limit

01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:06.250
where you just have kind of
two pencil-like back-to-back

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:06.750
things.

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:08.610
In that case, this goes to one.

01:05:08.610 --> 01:05:10.860
And if you wanted to find
something that goes to zero,

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.870
then you define it as tau.

01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:16.240
Just a little more convenient.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:21.040
And so it's possible to
work out that when you're

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:26.320
in a dijet configuration
that tau with a bit of work

01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:30.010
you can show it's actually
simply the sum of our two

01:05:30.010 --> 01:05:32.300
hemisphere invariant masses.

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.270
So obviously, in a
dijet configuration,

01:05:34.270 --> 01:05:36.880
there's lots of simplifications
to the kinematics.

01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:40.700
And with some work, one
can show that that's true.

01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.850
So what this is an
observable, which is simply

01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:46.300
a symmetric projection of
our previous two variable

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:48.730
observable onto one
variable observable.

01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:51.070
But if we demand that,
for example, tau is small,

01:05:51.070 --> 01:05:53.563
that's demanding both m
squared and n bar squared

01:05:53.563 --> 01:05:55.480
are small because they're
positive quantities,

01:05:55.480 --> 01:05:56.170
and we're just summing.

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:58.212
So demanding that this is
small is demanding both

01:05:58.212 --> 01:06:00.230
of those variables is small.

01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:06.670
So tau much less than one also
is a way of getting dijets,

01:06:06.670 --> 01:06:08.743
and that's a way of
getting dijets just

01:06:08.743 --> 01:06:10.160
with one variable
rather than two.

01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:12.100
So that's, of course,
easier to draw a picture

01:06:12.100 --> 01:06:14.890
with one thing rather than two.

01:06:14.890 --> 01:06:17.080
So if we take our formula
for the two variables

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:26.176
and we project onto one,
then we can do that.

01:06:26.176 --> 01:06:27.520
It looks like this.

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:43.600
So what happens to the
jet-- the two jet functions

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:45.490
and the soft function
that had two variables

01:06:45.490 --> 01:06:47.290
is that they get
projected kind of

01:06:47.290 --> 01:06:50.780
on to their symmetric
projection of the two variables.

01:06:50.780 --> 01:06:52.810
So this is like--

01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:55.120
these two are
symmetric projections.

01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:09.870
So we had two variables before,
and now we have one variable.

01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:11.940
And it's a symmetric
projection, and that just

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:14.015
follows from this formula.

01:07:14.015 --> 01:07:15.390
So literally, to
get this result,

01:07:15.390 --> 01:07:17.790
we would just do the
same trick we did before.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:26.570
We'd say that this is true.

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:29.080
Now let's move the
integral d m squared

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.607
and d n bar squared
onto the right hand side

01:07:31.607 --> 01:07:33.190
and think about doing
those integrals.

01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:35.040
And we follow through,
and it would lead

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:37.004
to a formula like this one.

01:07:37.004 --> 01:07:38.870
AUDIENCE: J tau is j squared?

01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:41.800
PROFESSOR: J tau is j squared.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:47.270
J tau is literally
j j integrated

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:50.390
over so fixing kind
some of the momentum

01:07:50.390 --> 01:07:53.111
and integrating
over the difference.

01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:55.220
So this guy depends
on one momentum,

01:07:55.220 --> 01:07:59.690
and this guy-- these guys depend
on 2, and there's one integral.

01:07:59.690 --> 01:08:03.560
And then s tau is
like one integral

01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:08.240
of kind of something like this.

01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.940
So let's call the
integral l prime.

01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:15.420
It's kind of like that.

01:08:19.270 --> 01:08:21.271
So that's what I mean by
asymmetric projection.

01:08:21.271 --> 01:08:22.979
AUDIENCE: And so how
do you know that tau

01:08:22.979 --> 01:08:26.410
can be written as
a function n bar,

01:08:26.410 --> 01:08:30.220
or could another kinematic
variable [INAUDIBLE]??

01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:32.800
PROFESSOR: No, it can be
written as a function of n bar.

01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:35.859
Yeah, because you're still--
if you're in subleading power,

01:08:35.859 --> 01:08:37.865
as long as you're in the
dijet's configuration,

01:08:37.865 --> 01:08:39.490
we've got the right
degrees of freedom.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:41.670
We don't need another
jet degree of freedom.

01:08:44.300 --> 01:08:46.090
So if you want to describe--

01:08:46.090 --> 01:08:48.970
you could think about
the thrust distribution.

01:08:48.970 --> 01:08:51.490
Well, let me answer your
question in more detail.

01:08:51.490 --> 01:08:52.990
Let me tell you
where you would have

01:08:52.990 --> 01:08:55.870
to worry about more
degrees of freedom,

01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:59.000
but let me do it in a second.

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:16.660
I'll give you-- all right,
so in the thrust case

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.760
and what we said about
masses carries over

01:09:18.760 --> 01:09:24.830
to a formula like this,
where this mu h squared

01:09:24.830 --> 01:09:30.580
being much bigger than
mu j squared, much bigger

01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:31.899
than mu s squared.

01:09:31.899 --> 01:09:39.790
And then that could be much
greater than or of order lambda

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:41.050
QCD squared.

01:09:41.050 --> 01:09:45.100
And the type of terms that our
factorization theorem would

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:49.300
be able to resum if we did the
renormalization group evolution

01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:54.340
would be sums of powers
of alpha and logs of tau.

01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:57.490
Tau is dimensionless
variable, and so the kind

01:09:57.490 --> 01:10:00.370
of terms that would show
up in the cross section

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:05.245
are terms like that plus
non-perturbative effects.

01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:11.700
So if you want to think
the base level, what

01:10:11.700 --> 01:10:15.300
is inside our formula,
it's all these terms.

01:10:15.300 --> 01:10:18.000
We're able to determine them
from our factorization theorem,

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.334
and then there's also
some non-perturbative,

01:10:20.334 --> 01:10:23.730
which would be kind of-- and
non-perturbative effects that

01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:26.388
in this f function.

01:10:26.388 --> 01:10:28.380
And the factorization
theorem is telling us

01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:32.350
how to compute these
things and include them.

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:35.367
So what does it look
like as a picture?

01:10:35.367 --> 01:10:36.950
What does the
cross-section look like?

01:10:39.630 --> 01:10:48.600
So there's a peak as I
promised, and there's kind of--

01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:49.650
and then there's a tail.

01:10:54.030 --> 01:10:59.670
And so this is tau.

01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:02.670
This is d sigma d tau.

01:11:02.670 --> 01:11:06.083
You can always normalize.

01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:07.500
This peak is
happening in the kind

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.670
of non-perturbative region.

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:14.225
So because it's a
symmetric projection,

01:11:14.225 --> 01:11:15.600
there's a factor
of two, but it's

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.510
kind of basically happening
when taus of order lambda

01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:19.440
QCD over q.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:22.630
And we could figure out
that just by power counting.

01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:26.520
And then depending
on the value of cue,

01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.050
that sort of for a
typical configuration, tau

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:32.520
equals 0.1 would
be over somewhere

01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:36.210
over there, et cetera.

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:39.650
So this is the peak, aptly named
because it looks like a peak.

01:11:39.650 --> 01:11:44.120
And in this peak, there's
non-perturbative effects

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:46.820
that come from the f.

01:11:46.820 --> 01:11:49.270
This is the tail.

01:11:49.270 --> 01:11:53.270
It could be called
the shoulder, but it's

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:56.180
kind of once you're
out here and down here,

01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:58.280
this is what you
call the tail where

01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:01.670
you have a perturbative s tau.

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:07.880
And then you would include
power corrections by expanding.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:11.280
And the expansion would give you
lambda QCD over the soft scale,

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.385
which is q tau.

01:12:13.385 --> 01:12:19.430
So this is-- that's that
expansion that we talked about,

01:12:19.430 --> 01:12:22.864
and that comes
from expanding it,

01:12:22.864 --> 01:12:28.862
f, or an expansion
that involves f.

01:12:28.862 --> 01:12:30.530
It's not expanding f.

01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.960
Basically, what
these numerators are

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:39.830
are moments of f once
you do the expansion.

01:12:39.830 --> 01:12:41.930
And then there's
a region out here,

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:45.110
and in both of these
regions, you have dijets.

01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:47.750
But in this region out here,
you don't have dijets anymore.

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:50.235
That's where tau is
starting to get large

01:12:50.235 --> 01:12:51.485
and you no longer have dijets.

01:12:57.320 --> 01:12:59.690
So if you wanted to think
about sort of higher order

01:12:59.690 --> 01:13:02.480
corrections in the
distribution out here,

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.030
then you would need to
perhaps think about three jets

01:13:05.030 --> 01:13:06.230
and other things.

01:13:06.230 --> 01:13:08.480
In particular, there's
also a kind of shoulder

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.260
here that if you
really want to think

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.260
about how power corrections
are kind of properly

01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:17.930
dealing with that region, you
think about more than two jets.

01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:21.390
But if you just kind of restrict
yourself to here and here,

01:13:21.390 --> 01:13:25.222
which is all we're going to
do, then you don't-- then every

01:13:25.222 --> 01:13:26.930
mode, even if you go
to subleading order,

01:13:26.930 --> 01:13:28.460
is exactly the ones
that we just said.

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:31.002
And you just have to deal with
them by constructing operators

01:13:31.002 --> 01:13:33.320
in subleading order.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:38.430
So that's the more detailed
answer to your question.

01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:39.852
Any other questions?

01:13:43.710 --> 01:13:50.490
OK, so I'll say a few things
about the perturbation theory.

01:13:50.490 --> 01:13:53.400
So so far we've kind
of argued that we

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:56.610
could get pretty far without
doing perturbation theory.

01:13:56.610 --> 01:13:59.640
So we got here without
doing perturbation theory.

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.670
What if we actually now want
to calculate these series,

01:14:02.670 --> 01:14:05.258
do the normalization
group evolution?

01:14:05.258 --> 01:14:06.300
How's that going to work?

01:14:10.970 --> 01:14:13.360
And it's actually--
in some ways,

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:17.350
it's a combination of the
two examples that we treated.

01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:20.080
We did an example where we
had a Wilson coefficient that

01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.520
was just running
multiplicatively,

01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:22.990
and we did another
example where we

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.642
had a function for deep
and elastic scattering.

01:14:25.642 --> 01:14:27.100
It had an integral,
and we're going

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.620
to have both of those
situations in this case.

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:37.030
So let me tell you how it works.

01:14:37.030 --> 01:14:41.500
So to get the hard function,
you would do some matching,

01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:44.470
and the matching is actually for
what people call the quark form

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:46.578
factor.

01:14:46.578 --> 01:14:49.120
So if you wonder why people care
about the quark form factor,

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:50.830
the quark form
factor is basically

01:14:50.830 --> 01:14:54.040
the h in our
formula, not exactly,

01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:56.430
but closely related to
the h in our formula.

01:15:00.470 --> 01:15:06.640
So you would do some one loop
matching by taking QCD graphs

01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:10.030
and subtracting the SCET graphs
in exactly the kind of way

01:15:10.030 --> 01:15:13.482
we were already doing
for the examples

01:15:13.482 --> 01:15:14.440
that we treated before.

01:15:24.030 --> 01:15:25.430
So those are collinear gluons.

01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:26.690
This is an ultra soft gluon.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:33.290
And there's some wave function
graphs that you can consider.

01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:35.180
We form the difference.

01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.390
And at one loop, we check
that all the IR divergences

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:41.330
between this and this
cancel, and then we

01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:42.925
get the Wilson coefficient.

01:15:48.270 --> 01:15:51.230
So this is very, very
analogous to the example

01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:53.810
that we did when we were
doing a heavy light current.

01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:15.870
And you see here that this
thing, which depends on mu,

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:18.060
it's mu over q.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:20.100
And that's what I was
saying that the Wilson

01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:22.050
coefficient or the hard
function should be--

01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:25.996
the log should be minimized
from mu of order q.

01:16:25.996 --> 01:16:27.870
And we see that by
doing the calculation.

01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:36.600
H is the square of this thing.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:39.390
So there's imaginary parts
on these negative logarithms.

01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:41.640
These are minus q
squared minus i 0.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.860
But when I take the mod
square, this thing is real.

01:16:50.850 --> 01:16:53.550
What about the jet function?

01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:56.280
Well, if you go back to what
the formula for the jet function

01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:00.360
was, the jet
function is basically

01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:06.090
two fields like spit out a
quark and absorb a quark.

01:17:06.090 --> 01:17:07.760
But it's a vacuum
matrix element,

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:10.207
so the quarks are
just contracted.

01:17:10.207 --> 01:17:11.790
So you're basically
calculating graphs

01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:14.290
like this or, really, actually
the imaginary parts of graphs

01:17:14.290 --> 01:17:16.092
like this because
the way I drew it,

01:17:16.092 --> 01:17:17.550
you were summing
over final states,

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.770
so it would be the
imaginary part.

01:17:20.770 --> 01:17:24.210
So we could just calculate the
graphs without putting a cut in

01:17:24.210 --> 01:17:26.430
and take the imaginary part,
and that would actually

01:17:26.430 --> 01:17:28.700
be giving us the jet function.

01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:32.760
So the jet function comes
from some Feynman diagrams

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:33.870
that look like this.

01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:44.480
And then there's one
more looks like that.

01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:46.850
So at one move, we have
those three Feynman diagrams.

01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:48.110
And then we have the
[INAUDIBLE] little guy.

01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:49.100
We take the imaginary part.

01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:50.100
We get the jet function.

01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:58.850
At lowest order, it
gives a delta function

01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:00.020
just to cut propagator.

01:18:07.020 --> 01:18:09.390
And then at one [INAUDIBLE],,
you get a delta function,

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:10.860
and you also get plus functions.

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:24.640
That may not worry so much
about what the numbers are.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.015
I can just tell you what
the result looks like.

01:18:28.015 --> 01:18:29.170
It looks like that.

01:18:29.170 --> 01:18:32.028
There's three different types
of terms that we could get.

01:18:32.028 --> 01:18:33.820
They all kind of have
a power counting that

01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:35.517
makes them go like one over s.

01:18:35.517 --> 01:18:36.850
And that you know ahead of time.

01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:39.760
If you power count
the operator here,

01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:40.990
it should scale one over s.

01:18:40.990 --> 01:18:42.740
These are the different
kind of structures

01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:45.317
that you can get at one
loop that scale one over s.

01:18:45.317 --> 01:18:46.900
And this is kind of
a symptom of there

01:18:46.900 --> 01:18:49.275
being 1 over epsilon
squared divergences,

01:18:49.275 --> 01:18:50.650
and this guy here
are [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:50.650 --> 01:18:51.692
the renormalized results.

01:18:51.692 --> 01:18:55.490
So we're taking care
of the renormalization.

01:18:55.490 --> 01:18:57.380
So just like in our example--

01:18:57.380 --> 01:18:59.450
I mean, it's the
same diagram really.

01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:02.420
Just this diagram was
familiar because this diagram

01:19:02.420 --> 01:19:04.130
was showing up in
beta s gamma, right?

01:19:04.130 --> 01:19:06.800
So we saw it had 1 over
epsilon squared poles.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:10.862
Here, the 1 over epsilon
squared poles lead to this.

01:19:10.862 --> 01:19:12.320
And, really, you
can actually think

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:13.820
of that very closely
related to what

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:16.970
we did because we were finding
logs of mu squared over p

01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:20.040
squared, but here, p
squared is a physical thing.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:23.780
It's the s, the invariant mass
that we pump into the operator.

01:19:23.780 --> 01:19:28.810
S is kind of what we
put in through the--

01:19:28.810 --> 01:19:33.830
we put in a momentum,
if you like, q, where--

01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:34.820
I shouldn't call it q--

01:19:37.622 --> 01:19:41.990
t mu where s is
t squared, right?

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:45.890
And so before we were having
logs of p squared, which

01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:48.740
were an IR regulator, but in
this calculation for this jet

01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.990
function, it's actually
a physical thing.

01:19:50.990 --> 01:19:54.840
And it's giving the momentum
dependents of the jet function,

01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:58.400
but it's the right thing to
stick into the factorization

01:19:58.400 --> 01:20:00.200
theorem.

01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.990
And then there's
the soft function

01:20:02.990 --> 01:20:08.180
where if it's perturbative,
you can calculate it.

01:20:08.180 --> 01:20:12.320
And you can draw these kind of
in some notation for the Wilson

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.800
lines.

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:21.680
So here's our Wilson lines
in different directions.

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.970
And then want this
matrix element squared,

01:20:23.970 --> 01:20:26.060
and, again, you
can sort of think

01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:30.590
of as kind of cut graphs
like that if you like.

01:20:30.590 --> 01:20:35.540
And if we look at
the soft function,

01:20:35.540 --> 01:20:39.720
it kind of has a similar
structure to the jet function

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:43.200
but now with the--

01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.730
so, again, it's got a
delta function and then

01:20:46.730 --> 01:20:47.660
plus functions.

01:20:55.541 --> 01:20:56.041
Whoops.

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:03.830
And it turns out there's
no single plus function,

01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:09.470
but there is a plus function
with a logarithm in this case.

01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:17.920
And then same for l minus.

01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.480
Same structure.

01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:21.560
It's just a product if you like.

01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:24.020
And the reason that happens
is if you only have one gluon,

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:26.030
it's either in hemisphere
A or hemisphere

01:21:26.030 --> 01:21:27.900
B. It can't be in both.

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:30.500
So the alpha s corrections are
either a function of l plus

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.540
or a function of l
minus, and that's

01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:34.860
why it has a kind of very
simple structure at one loop.

01:21:52.235 --> 01:21:53.610
So that gives you
an idea of what

01:21:53.610 --> 01:21:55.980
these perturbative
functions look like.

01:21:55.980 --> 01:21:58.380
C, if you talk about
renormalization,

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:01.067
C renormalizes multiplicatively.

01:22:05.050 --> 01:22:08.320
And so the renormalization
group equation for C

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:13.320
is just like the one we had
before for beta s gamma.

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.100
There's no integrals.

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.900
That, again, came about
from the kinematics

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:22.970
fixing the variables.

01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:30.950
But the jet function
and the soft function

01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:34.310
have convolutions in this case.

01:22:41.232 --> 01:22:43.190
Well, they depend on this
non-trivial momentum,

01:22:43.190 --> 01:22:45.170
and it's--

01:22:45.170 --> 01:22:48.620
you can see in the factorization
theorem, that is convoluting

01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:49.880
between two different sectors.

01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:52.310
And it kind of
generically a hint

01:22:52.310 --> 01:22:57.332
that you're going to get out
a formula like this one, which

01:22:57.332 --> 01:23:01.140
is like the PDF, but now
it's a different formula.

01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:05.040
It was kind of an almost
dimension for the jet function.

01:23:09.350 --> 01:23:11.620
So we could go through
that, but I was not

01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:14.792
writing down for you what the
1 over epsilons look like.

01:23:14.792 --> 01:23:18.940
But we could go through
the renormalization

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:20.310
and find these results.

01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:33.470
And actually, in this
jet function case,

01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:36.140
we even know more.

01:23:36.140 --> 01:23:39.680
The general structure of
this anomalous dimension

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:42.350
is actually simpler than the
Parton distribution case.

01:23:46.370 --> 01:23:49.795
And it's the following.

01:23:56.590 --> 01:24:00.155
There's two types of
terms that can show up.

01:24:00.155 --> 01:24:02.280
So the general structure
of the anomalous dimension

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:05.700
is that there's a
single plus function

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:07.710
in it or a delta function.

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:10.620
And this single plus
function is the analog

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:13.050
in the jet function of
the single logarithm that

01:24:13.050 --> 01:24:14.290
was showing up.

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:17.370
Remember that when we
decompose this guy,

01:24:17.370 --> 01:24:20.370
there could be a
log mu over q term

01:24:20.370 --> 01:24:24.690
or a one term with
no log of mu over q.

01:24:24.690 --> 01:24:28.080
This is like an analog of
a log, this plus function.

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:30.210
If you integrate
over s, then it's

01:24:30.210 --> 01:24:31.960
like ds over s,
which is like a log.

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:35.220
So this is a log, and
integrating delta of s

01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:37.370
is like one.

01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:38.980
So the analog
statement that there

01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:42.090
was two possibilities there.

01:24:42.090 --> 01:24:43.930
In this case, there's
an analog of that,

01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:45.670
and there's two
possibilities here.

01:24:45.670 --> 01:24:47.250
And what perturbation
theory is doing

01:24:47.250 --> 01:24:50.100
is actually just computing
the coefficients of these two

01:24:50.100 --> 01:24:52.430
different structures.

01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:57.110
OK, and we're out of time,
so I'll say a few more words

01:24:57.110 --> 01:25:00.050
about how you would solve,
for example, an equation

01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:01.730
like this one.

01:25:01.730 --> 01:25:03.650
Next time I'll tell
you how to solve it,

01:25:03.650 --> 01:25:06.928
and then we'll basically
be done with our example.

01:25:06.928 --> 01:25:09.470
We'll put things back together
and write down a factorization

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:13.953
theorem that includes
the resummation

01:25:13.953 --> 01:25:15.620
and then we'll go on
to another example.

01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:21.000
Moving on, the next example
we'll treat after this one

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.650
is SCET two where
we'll be dealing

01:25:25.650 --> 01:25:28.830
with energetic hadrons,
some other types of examples

01:25:28.830 --> 01:25:30.770
besides jets.

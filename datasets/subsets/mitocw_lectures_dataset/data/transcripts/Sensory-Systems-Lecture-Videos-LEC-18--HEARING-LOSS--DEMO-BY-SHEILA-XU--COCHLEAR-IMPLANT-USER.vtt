00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.010
PROFESSOR: OK, I guess
we'll get started.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.270
Last time, we were talking
about the auditory pathway

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.660
in the brain, the
central auditory pathway,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.850
starting with the
cochlear nucleus

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.970
and going up through
the various brain

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.690
stem, the thalamic and
cortical auditory areas.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.070
And then we focused mainly
on the cochlear nucleus,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.280
which is the very first of those
many auditory central nuclei.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.220
And we talked
about the diversity

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.930
of cell types or neuron
types in the cochlear nucleus

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.230
and the diversity
of response types

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.950
when you monitor the responses
of single neurons to sound.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.930
And we did some attempts at
correlation between the two.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.530
And those are firmly established
in the cochlear nucleus,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.080
much better than anywhere
else in the auditory

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.330
pathways certainly.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.470
So any questions from last time?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:40.500
So today's lecture is on
hearing loss and implants that

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.800
restore our sense of hearing
if we happen to be deaf.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.510
And I've written
a little summary

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.550
of what I want to cover
today on the board.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.350
So we'll start out with the
first 2/3 of the lecture being

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.270
on hearing loss.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.740
And we've mentioned a little
about the conductive apparatus,

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.220
the eardrum, the three
ossicles in the middle ear,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.320
conveying the vibrations
to the inner ear.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.100
And I think we had an example of
one type of conductive hearing

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.020
loss.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.630
If you have, obviously, an
interruption of that ossicular

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.650
chain, then the
vibrations are going

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.469
to be reduced in the inner
ear in the conduction pah--

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.260
because the conduction
path is interrupted.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.970
So those are relatively
straightforward concepts,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.580
and so consider those covered.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.950
Today, I want to talk
about the, perhaps,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.820
more common types
of hearing loss

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.900
that are grouped under
the name sensorineural

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.060
because the sensory cells, or
the nerve fibers themselves,

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.570
are damaged.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.110
And in that case, it's
not so easy to understand

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.710
how we might correct
them by putting

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.340
in an artificial middle ear
ossicle or something like that.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.360
This is a bit of a misnomer
in that perhaps 99% of hearing

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.610
loss and deafness of
this type was really

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.675
based on the sensory
cells, so the hair cells

00:03:21.675 --> 00:03:25.521
are the prime culprit in people
who have sensorineural hearing

00:03:25.521 --> 00:03:26.020
loss.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.845
The most vulnerable,
of the two types

00:03:30.845 --> 00:03:32.470
of hair cells we've
been talking about,

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.715
are the outer hair cells.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.070
Any of the various causes that
we'll talk about that damage

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.470
our hearing affect
the outer hair

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.960
cells to a much greater degree
than the inner hair cells,

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.614
and the reason for
that is not known.

00:03:47.614 --> 00:03:50.030
For some reason, the outer
hair cells are more vulnerable.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:55.340
As we'll see in the very first
slide of today's lecture,

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.070
those hair cells in the
basal turn of the cochlea

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.215
are more vulnerable than those
in more a apical regions.

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.980
Reason for that is
not known either.

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.870
It's a very interesting
phenomenon with no basis

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.550
that we know about.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.430
We'll talk about permanent
and temporary hearing

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.410
loss, the various
causes of hearing loss,

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.580
and then, at the end, we'll
talk about the various neural

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.265
prostheses, or implants, that
are used to restore hearing.

00:04:28.674 --> 00:04:30.340
And the most famous
of those, of course,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.230
is the cochlear implant.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.580
We hope to have a visit
from a subject who's

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.680
deaf, who uses a
cochlear implant,

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.187
and she'll be able to
demonstrate her implant to you

00:04:42.187 --> 00:04:46.170
and answer questions if
you want to ask them of her

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.790
about her cochlear implant.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.700
We'll also cover a couple
other different types

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:53.100
of implants that are
used to restore hearing.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.520
So this first slide talks about
sensorineural hearing loss

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.020
in general.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:07.220
And a very common pattern of
sensorineural hearing loss,

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.190
which comes from the basal
turn being most affected.

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.210
This is an audiogram,
if you will,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:20.130
a graph of hearing level in
terms of sound pressure level,

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:24.900
hearing threshold as a function
of sound frequency for,

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.760
in this lower curve,
a normal hearing

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:33.280
human and, in this upper curve,
a typical pattern for someone

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.015
who has a mild to moderate
sensorineural hearing loss.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.410
And so as you can
see, this individual

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:45.230
with the hearing loss has
perfectly normal hearing

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.070
thresholds up to the middle
frequency, 1,000 Hertz,

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.470
but then their
threshold of hearing

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.260
deviates from the normal so
that by about 10,000 Hertz,

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.570
they have a hearing
loss of 60 dB or so.

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.590
This is a very common
pattern of hearing loss that

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.530
arises because, for some
reason, the basal turn is

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:08.205
more affected.

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:12.660
The basal turn is where
you have the responses

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.486
to the very highest
sound frequencies.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:21.810
This person will come into
the Massachussetts Eye and Ear

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.740
Infirmary, for example,
and complain to the doctors

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.200
and audiologists there when
the hearing loss becomes

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.160
noticeable, when they have a
problem understanding speech.

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:39.950
Hearing loss is
intimately entwined

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:43.230
with our perception and
understanding of speech.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.090
And so when people have
problems understanding speech,

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.080
they often seek medical advice.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.530
Now, the most important
frequencies for those in speech

00:06:56.530 --> 00:07:00.230
are between about
300 and 4,000 Hertz.

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:03.070
So you can see this person's
hearing loss is clearly

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:07.210
getting into the
speech range, and they

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:10.560
may have problems discerning
the more high frequency

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:11.540
parts of speech.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.970
So what are those?

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:18.800
So typically vowels, which
have the formants that we talk

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.940
about, have very low
frequency, so something

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:24.015
like ahhh and oooh.

00:07:24.015 --> 00:07:25.265
They are very low frequencies.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.850
But I think if you could read
this diagram a little better,

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:33.020
you'd understand that
high-pitched sounds

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:37.690
like the "sss" sound
of an s, or something

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.950
that has an abrupt
onset, like a "t",

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:43.440
has a lot of high
frequencies in that sound.

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:49.510
And so those are going to be
the first types of speech sounds

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.620
that are hard to
understand for the person

00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.870
with the impaired graph
on the top slide there.

00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:01.220
Now at first, you
might say, well,

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:05.610
what we should do is get a
hearing aid that amplifies

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:10.810
the frequencies that
are in loss area OK.

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.070
So to do that,
you'd have to have

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:15.190
a pretty sophisticated
hearing aid.

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:18.490
You'd have to, for
each sound frequency,

00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.680
dial in the exact
amount of amplification.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:25.450
And hearing aids are
very good these days,

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:30.260
and there are hearing aids
that can be used on a frequency

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.179
specific manner, that is
don't amplify anything

00:08:33.179 --> 00:08:37.277
at low frequencies and amplify
exactly the amount of loss

00:08:37.277 --> 00:08:38.110
at high frequencies.

00:08:39.250 --> 00:08:41.750
So at first, it sounds
like a good idea,

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:46.040
but we'll get into the reason
that that doesn't always

00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.480
work later on.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.460
So that simple solution,
just install a hearing aid--

00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:59.130
a hearing aid, which everybody
has seen one probably in older

00:08:59.130 --> 00:09:02.560
people-- is simply an amplifier.

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.775
It has a microphone.

00:09:03.775 --> 00:09:04.910
It picks up sound.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:10.100
It boosts the sound
in whatever frequency

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.850
ranges the audiologist programs.

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:17.710
And then it has a little
speaker and it speaks or plays

00:09:17.710 --> 00:09:20.847
the boosted sound into the
ear canal of the person.

00:09:20.847 --> 00:09:21.930
So it's just an amplifier.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.140
So you can have hearing
aids that work very well

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.360
and their frequency tailored.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.580
And they especially
work very well

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.200
for the type of
hearing loss that's

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.350
called the conductive
hearing loss because, simply,

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:43.080
the problem is getting the
sound into the inner ear,

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.550
and amplifying the
sound, in a person

00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.580
with a conductive hearing
loss, works very well.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.520
It doesn't work so well
in sensorineural hearing

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.940
loss for reasons we'll
get into in a little bit.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:02.120
Now how do these
hearing losses happen?

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.690
There are a variety of causes
that can damage your hearing.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:12.360
We all have fun with sounds,
and we tend to have a lot of fun

00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.845
when the sounds
are very intense.

00:10:14.990 --> 00:10:18.790
And these are so-- this is an
old transparency obviously.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:23.310
But this is a graph of
sound pressure level here.

00:10:23.310 --> 00:10:26.940
Remember the thresholds of
hearing are way down here.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.660
And these are some
example sounds

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:32.240
that have very high
level, and most of these

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.520
are damaging, at least if you
listen to them long enough.

00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:42.250
Obviously, gunshots,
firecrackers are very damaging.

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:45.920
Those sounds are in
excess of 120 dB.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:50.320
So a single gunshot, if
it's close to your head,

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.520
can be damaging.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:56.340
So we had-- we're going
to have an example of that

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.730
in just a minute.

00:10:57.730 --> 00:11:00.380
Some of these sounds
are more moderate,

00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:05.710
around the region of 100 dB SPL,
for example, a chainsaw, a leaf

00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:09.300
blower, the symphony
orchestra here.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.470
So everybody goes to
the symphony, right?

00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:14.650
So obviously,
these things depend

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:17.410
on how close you are
to the object that's

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.090
generating the sound, right?

00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:20.600
So if you go to the
Boston Symphony,

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:22.350
you're not going to
endure a hearing loss.

00:11:22.350 --> 00:11:25.360
But if you have good
seats and are looking down

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.430
on the symphony, you'll see
that a lot of the woodwind

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:31.190
players who are sitting
right in front of the brass,

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.570
for example, the
trumpet players, they

00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.620
have a little
screen behind them,

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:38.360
a plexiglass screen that's
pretty invisible unless you're

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.590
looking for it.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:43.980
That causes a sound shadow,
and so it protects their ears

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:45.480
from the blast of the bras.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.212
And I've also been
in the symphony

00:11:48.212 --> 00:11:50.420
where, sometimes, the woodwind
players would actually

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.450
put in ear plugs when
there's a big brass solo,

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:56.229
and brass is blowing like crazy.

00:11:56.229 --> 00:11:58.270
And then after that big
solo, they take them out,

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.300
and they play their
own little solo.

00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.550
So professional
musicians are obviously

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.220
very worried about
their hearing.

00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:09.730
And it can be, if you're
close to a trumpet or a brass

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:13.600
instrument, deafening-- or
in front of a big timpani

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.570
or snare drums-- of
course, these things

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.910
depend on how long
you listen to them,

00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:23.690
so the damage is cumulative.

00:12:23.690 --> 00:12:27.440
It may take many years
of exposure at 90 dB

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.640
to produce a hearing
loss even though exposure

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.610
to a really high sound
level, like the 160 dB,

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:38.290
may give you hearing loss
after just a single exposure.

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.000
So legally, employers
are supposed

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.230
to provide hearing
protection for their workers

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:47.760
if you send a worker
in to an 85 dB

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.140
sound pressure level
environment, like is

00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.630
common in a factory,
you are supposed

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.070
to provide the workers
with hearing protection

00:12:55.070 --> 00:12:57.000
if it's an 8 hour shift.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.270
If it's only a 4 hour
shift, you don't have to.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.740
If the sound level is 95 dB,
it's something like 2 hours.

00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:10.650
If it's 100 dB, you can expose
someone to an hour of that

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.590
without hearing protection,
but if it's longer than that,

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.220
you have to provide
hearing protection.

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:20.570
So here's some example.

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:24.030
Movie theaters,
Godzilla is 118 dB

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.685
because it's a terrible roar.

00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:29.960
It can be deafening if you are
right near the loudspeaker.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.901
And if you go to
Godzilla 100 times.

00:13:31.901 --> 00:13:32.400
OK?

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.830
All right.

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:41.340
So loud sound is one of
the causes of hearing loss,

00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:43.130
so let's just make
a little list here.

00:13:58.210 --> 00:14:00.310
High level sound
is certainly one

00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.040
of the causes of
hearing loss, and I

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.780
think we have some
examples here.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:11.830
So this is an example
from some research that

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:14.690
was done by one of
the professors I had

00:14:14.690 --> 00:14:17.340
in graduate school, Joe Hawkins.

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:21.790
And he studied
temporal bones where

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:24.250
the cochlear is in humans.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:28.190
So he would get temporal bones
after a subject had passed away

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:30.670
and had donated their
body to science.

00:14:30.670 --> 00:14:34.940
And they were useful if he knew
something about the individual,

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.460
like if they had
their hearing tested

00:14:37.460 --> 00:14:39.741
or if you knew a little
bit about what activities

00:14:39.741 --> 00:14:40.240
they liked.

00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:44.690
These particular
data are from a human

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:48.260
who is an active hunter,
fired a gun a lot.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:56.070
And the specimens shown
in the photomicrographs

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:59.170
here are looking
down onto the surface

00:14:59.170 --> 00:15:04.670
of the inner ear, or
cochlea, on the left side

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.256
and the right side
of the subject.

00:15:08.030 --> 00:15:11.860
The bone that's on the
snail shell, or cochlea,

00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:14.650
has been thinned away
with a dental drill,

00:15:14.650 --> 00:15:18.740
and you can see very
nicely the basal turn.

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.310
The apical turn, you can't
really see very well from that,

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:24.280
but you can thin the
apical turn as well.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:24.780
Sometimes.

00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.150
It's cut off and thinned
in a different dish.

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.620
But anyway, what you're
looking at here--

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.395
I should get out my pointer,
so I point a little better.

00:15:40.950 --> 00:15:45.990
So this is the very basal end
of the cochlea and spiraling up.

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:49.730
And the human has about 2
and 1/2 or 3 complete turns

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:50.355
of the cochlea.

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:55.600
And this white structure
here is the organ

00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.725
of Corti sitting on
the basilar membrane.

00:16:00.740 --> 00:16:04.790
This specimen is stained with
a stain called osmium, which

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:09.630
stains lipids and especially
myelinated nerve fibers,

00:16:09.630 --> 00:16:12.900
so you can see a lot of
myelinated nerve fibers.

00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:15.690
They looks like
threads coming out.

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.375
And here's some more
threads up here.

00:16:18.460 --> 00:16:22.100
And I said the organ
of Corti is here,

00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:26.200
but actually, it's completely
gone here on the left side,

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:29.190
and you can see it
begin right about here

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:32.660
and go apically here up
into the apical turn.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:34.470
You can see a very
little bit of it

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:38.340
in the extreme basal
part of the cochlea,

00:16:38.340 --> 00:16:40.720
and that's diagrammed
here on this graph.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:44.930
This is the length along
the basilar membrane

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:48.470
from the base over here
on the right to the apex.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.084
And this y-axis graphs the
percent of the hair cells

00:16:53.084 --> 00:16:53.875
that are remaining.

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:57.820
And in the basal
turn, they're almost

00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.930
zero hair cells remaining.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.450
They're all gone.

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:04.770
Maybe a couple little
islands here and there,

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:08.089
but it's virtually
100% hair cell loss.

00:17:08.089 --> 00:17:11.619
And as you go around
the upper basal turn,

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:13.819
you have most of the
hair cells remaining

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:16.904
in the case of the solid line,
which refers to the inner hair

00:17:16.904 --> 00:17:17.404
cells.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:21.300
And then you have, in the
dashed lines, the three

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:24.869
rows of outer hair
cells, and there, maybe

00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:28.760
between 30% and 70%
remaining depending

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:29.860
exactly where you are.

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.230
But here again, something
has damaged these hair cells,

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:36.650
completely wiped them out in
the basal half of the cochlea.

00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:38.760
And wiped a lot of
the outer hair cells

00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.250
out and not very many of the
inner hair cells are wiped out.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.794
Here's the subject's
right cochlea.

00:17:46.794 --> 00:17:48.710
And in this case, you
can see-- you don't even

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.670
need the graph-- you can
see that the organ of Corti

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:54.470
is pretty intact.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:57.790
Here is a little island
of loss, and then

00:17:57.790 --> 00:17:59.920
another little island
of loss, but then you

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:03.840
have an intact organ of Corti
all the way up to the apex,

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.030
and that's reflected in the
counts here where you have,

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:11.460
except at the very basal
part of the cochlea which

00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.460
doesn't appear in
the micrograph,

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:16.400
you have a pretty normal
complement of inner hair cells.

00:18:17.697 --> 00:18:19.530
Outer hair cells are
not in such good shape,

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:23.280
but they're present throughout
the cochlea in this right side.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:28.470
Now, also on here are
graphs of the nerve fibers.

00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:33.380
Those are these little
thread-like stained elements

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.600
here that appear very
nicely in this osmium stain,

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.500
and they're pretty much
intact through the cochlea.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:45.040
Maybe in places here where the
hair cell loss is really bad,

00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.700
some of the nerve
fibers are gone,

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.270
and that's indicated by
this interruption here.

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.470
But this is another
example where

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:56.890
you can have whatever damaged
this fellow's hair cells, left

00:18:56.890 --> 00:18:59.550
the nerve fibers
relatively intact.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:01.630
And this offers some
hope to somebody

00:19:01.630 --> 00:19:05.430
who wants to install a
prosthesis like the cochlear

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:09.029
implant and stimulate the
remaining nerve fiber just

00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:10.570
because they're
going to stick around

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.740
even if a lot of the
hair cells are gone.

00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:18.730
So this subject, as I said,
was an enthusiastic hunter,

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:20.310
and a he was right-handed.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.010
And as you can see
right here, this

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.480
is a top view of a
person firing a rifle.

00:19:27.820 --> 00:19:30.500
The left ear of the
subject is pointed

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.300
toward the tip of
the gun, and that's

00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.820
where the bullet
emerges, and that's

00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:37.790
where the shock wave of
the rifle, when it fires,

00:19:37.790 --> 00:19:38.500
comes out.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.820
This is a modern rifle,
not a flintlock rifle

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.580
where you have a lot of smoke
and sound coming out down here.

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:48.090
Most of the sound comes
at the tip of the gun.

00:19:48.090 --> 00:19:51.340
And this subject's left ear
is pointed right to that

00:19:51.340 --> 00:19:53.640
and has taken the
brunt of the blast

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.240
in terms of the
loss of hair cells.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.010
The right ear of the
subject is pointed more away

00:20:00.010 --> 00:20:01.950
from the tip of the
gun and is protected

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:05.560
and has a pretty normal
complement of hair cells.

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.370
Now, that's not saying
that this person didn't

00:20:08.370 --> 00:20:11.560
go to lots of rock
concerts, and didn't

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:14.050
take lots of drugs that
damage your hearing,

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:17.840
and isn't an 80-year-old
person, so we're

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.230
going to add a few
things to our list here.

00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:33.020
There are some drugs, for
example aminoglycoside

00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:42.010
antibiotics-- they are
really great antibiotics,

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:45.800
but they have this side effect
of damaging the hair cells.

00:20:47.610 --> 00:20:55.570
Three, the aging
process damages hearing.

00:20:55.570 --> 00:21:01.300
And in this kind of a study
where you're using a human,

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.470
you cannot control for these
other factors and others that I

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:11.230
haven't, but what you can do
then is compare left to right.

00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:14.730
Because presumably,
a subject took drugs,

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.565
and they appeared in both the
left and right in your ears.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:23.010
And obviously, the
subject had the same aging

00:21:23.010 --> 00:21:26.500
in the left and right side,
so whatever differences there

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:28.860
are between the
left and the right,

00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:31.950
we attribute then to
the blast from the rifle

00:21:31.950 --> 00:21:33.360
that the subject shot.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.740
So this cause of
left right difference

00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:38.890
would be attributed to
the high level sound.

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:50.240
Here are some pictures
from an experiment animal

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:54.690
that has undergone a high sound
level, or an overexposure.

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.220
This is a normal-- I
think, in this case,

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.720
it's a Guinea pig cochlea.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:06.220
And you see the row of
inner hair cells here.

00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:11.310
There is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, about
a dozen inner hair cells.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:13.410
That's just one row
of inner hair cells.

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:16.050
And then there are three rows
of outer hair cells looking down

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.591
onto the tops of
the hair cells where

00:22:17.591 --> 00:22:19.670
you have the stereocilia
sticking up at you.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.340
And there are 12 or
15 outer hair cells

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.790
in each of rows 1, 2, and 3.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:31.430
And it's such a regular pattern,
and they're all perfectly

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:32.410
there.

00:22:32.410 --> 00:22:37.130
After listening to the
overexposure of sound,

00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:39.425
there are quite a few
inner hair cells lost.

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:42.420
Those that are
remaining sometimes

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.460
have abnormal stereocilia.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.480
There are number of outer
hair cells, in this case,

00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.400
in row one lost.

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.400
And some that are remaining
are indicated by these arrows

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.055
to have abnormal stereocilia.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.490
And here's another example
from a different place

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:03.400
in the cochlea where almost the
entire third row of outer hair

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:08.390
cells is wiped out by the
overexposure to noise.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:14.620
So what happens when
you lose a hair cell?

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:19.920
Well, the nearby supporting
cells go fill in its space,

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.130
and they take over.

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:25.400
In mammals, such
damage is permanent.

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.825
Once the hair cell is
killed, it never grows back.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.500
And there's a lot of
interest in trying

00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:36.110
to coax the nearby
supporting cells

00:23:36.110 --> 00:23:39.430
to, in these damage
cochleas, become hair cells.

00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.190
But so far that has
not been possible.

00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:47.400
The field was really
excited about 20 years ago

00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:51.990
when this type of damage
in a bird cochlea,

00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:55.780
if left for a month
or so, you see

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:58.300
reemerging small hair cells.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.350
And if you wait long enough,
they become full hair cells.

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:06.160
In the bird cochlea, the
surrounding supporting cells,

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:11.770
after damage to the hair cells,
can then divide and become

00:24:11.770 --> 00:24:15.110
new hair cells, in the
chicken cochlea, for example.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:18.470
And this was a
serendipitous discovery

00:24:18.470 --> 00:24:23.545
where people were working on
damaging chicken hair cells,

00:24:23.545 --> 00:24:27.140
and they were always waiting a
couple days after the exposure

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.450
to look at the cochleas.

00:24:29.450 --> 00:24:33.760
And there was a holiday vacation
where they exposed the animals

00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.272
before, and they
went out of town

00:24:36.272 --> 00:24:37.980
and came back three
weeks later, and they

00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:41.340
found something must have
gone wrong with the exposure

00:24:41.340 --> 00:24:42.890
because the hair cells are here.

00:24:42.890 --> 00:24:44.010
They're fine.

00:24:44.010 --> 00:24:45.940
But they figured out
later that, actually,

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.075
the supporting cells
nearby had grown back.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.580
So that doesn't seem to help
us in the mammalian pathway.

00:24:53.580 --> 00:24:56.690
There's some sort of
growth factor or growth

00:24:56.690 --> 00:25:00.590
pathway in birds where
these hair cells grow back,

00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:02.300
but not in the
mammal unfortunately.

00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:13.150
So this is an example
from a cochlea that's

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:18.970
been treated by
an aminoglycoside,

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.330
and this is just to
remind me to tell you

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:29.090
that, once again, you can count
hair cells along the cochlea.

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.800
This is a plot of
hair cells present

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.350
where lots of black bars
means lots of hair cells.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:40.690
And this is a beautiful
example of this particular drug

00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:45.220
treatment, which I
believe is kanamycin,

00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:48.850
and a certain dose doesn't
affect the inner hair cells

00:25:48.850 --> 00:25:49.350
at all.

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.410
But look at the
outer hair cell loss

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:56.640
in the basal part of the
cochlea, virtually complete

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.000
outer hair cell loss showing
that the outer hair cells are

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:04.341
more sensitive, they're more
labile to this drug treatment

00:26:04.341 --> 00:26:05.590
than are the inner hair cells.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:12.220
And once again, the most
vulnerable part of the cochlea

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.760
is not the apex.

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.080
0% distance from
the apex is up here.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.870
And the basal region
would be down here,

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.990
and that's again the
most vulnerable part

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:22.380
of the cochlear for some reason.

00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:27.770
We can speculate
about why this might

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:29.950
be the case for drug treatment.

00:26:29.950 --> 00:26:32.970
We don't know this,
but maybe the drug

00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.035
appears in more in a
higher concentration

00:26:36.035 --> 00:26:37.410
in the basal part
of the cochlea.

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:41.900
In the cochlea, like
you have in the brain,

00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:44.440
you have a blood-brain barrier.

00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.410
You have a
blood-cochlea barrier.

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:50.610
Obviously, some drug has
gotten into the cochlea,

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.970
but maybe the
blood-cochlea barrier

00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:56.580
is more permeable
down here in the base.

00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.080
And in the apex not
as much drug got in.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.760
That's an idea.

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.680
It hasn't been borne out
by experimental evidence,

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.620
but it's an idea that
people have in mind.

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:08.430
Or, it could be
that the outer hair

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:11.765
cells are just, for some reason,
easier to kill in the base.

00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:17.050
That's more suggestive
that all of these things

00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:19.760
affect the hair cells in
the base more than the apex.

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:26.560
Now, these were some of the
original experiments that

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.500
showed what outer hair cells did
for us in the sense of hearing.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.940
So earlier in this
course, we had the effect

00:27:33.940 --> 00:27:37.360
of knocking out the
outer hair cells

00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.495
by knocking out the
gene for Prestin.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.910
OK?

00:27:41.910 --> 00:27:44.040
In this case, the
outer hair cells

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.440
are knocked out by
the drug treatment.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.120
So you've lesioned
the outer hair cells

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:50.820
in the very basal
part of the cochlea.

00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:53.085
The inner hair
cells are present.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:59.130
Let's look at the tuning
curves from auditory nerve

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:00.700
fibers in that preparation.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:05.350
Now let me remind you again
what's happening here.

00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:10.260
So you have the
inner hair cells,

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:16.950
and you have the
outer hair cells,

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:21.200
which have been killed
by the drug treatment.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.720
And then you have most of the
auditory nerve fibers coming

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:32.550
from the inner hair cells
in the auditory nerve going

00:28:32.550 --> 00:28:33.860
to the brain.

00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:37.800
And the experiment then is to
if you're recording electrodes,

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:41.300
record from the
auditory nerve fibers,

00:28:41.300 --> 00:28:46.510
get a single nerve fiber,
and take its tuning curve.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:50.640
And that's what's shown
on this top graph.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.950
So tuning curves from the
normal region of the cochlea

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:56.500
are normal shaped.

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.266
They have sharp tips and
tails, normal sensitivity.

00:29:02.197 --> 00:29:04.530
In the region of the cochlea
when the drug treatment has

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:07.870
lesioned the outer hair
cells, the tuning curves

00:29:07.870 --> 00:29:09.650
look extremely abnormal.

00:29:09.650 --> 00:29:14.720
There's a tail, whatever tip
there is is a tiny little tip,

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:19.560
and there's a tremendous loss
of sensitivity, as much as 60

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:21.950
or more dB lost.

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:24.540
Basically, these are
tipless tuning curves.

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.750
And now we know that
the outer hair cells

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:31.090
have their
electromotility function.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.300
They are the cochlea amplifier.

00:29:33.300 --> 00:29:35.930
Without the amplifier, you lose
the tip on the tuning curve.

00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.940
So that should be a mini review.

00:29:39.980 --> 00:29:42.630
This is the way the outer
hair cells originally

00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:45.702
thought-- or discovered
to be important

00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:47.160
in the sense of
hearing, to provide

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.050
the normal sensitivity
and a sharp tuning.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:53.770
You can get all kinds of tuning
curve abnormalities depending

00:29:53.770 --> 00:29:58.160
on whether you, in this case,
lose all the outer hair cells.

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.270
You cause disarray
of the stereocilia.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:04.820
You have partial loss
of the outer hair cells.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:09.650
All these kinds of things can
be found after noise damage

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:14.130
depending on the place of
the cochlea you look at,

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:18.250
the type of noise, the
length of the noise exposure,

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:19.940
and the animal.

00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:24.820
There's a lot of variability
in noise damage from exposures

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.020
to 10-- 10 different
animals, you

00:30:27.020 --> 00:30:31.260
can have 10 different types
of loss of hair cells.

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:33.440
Noise damage is
tremendously variable

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.565
from subject to subject.

00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.390
Now, we also had--
this is another review.

00:30:45.390 --> 00:30:49.670
We also had the example of a
psychophycial tuning curve.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:52.660
So this is a normal
psychophysical tuning curve.

00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.670
Can somebody explain to
me what the paradigm is?

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.650
A psychophysical
tuning curve, it's

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:02.037
taken from a human
listener, right?

00:31:02.037 --> 00:31:02.870
What's the paradigm?

00:31:10.490 --> 00:31:13.830
We had this in class, so we
should all know what this is.

00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:17.825
A psychophysical tuning
curve, you have a probe tone.

00:31:18.990 --> 00:31:21.030
I think that, in this
case, the probe tone

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.060
is right at the
tip of the arrow.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:27.200
And the subject is instructed
to listen to the probe tone

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:30.070
and say when you
hear the probe tone.

00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:31.520
Give the probe tone.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.270
Yes, I hear that definitely.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:33.880
Give it again.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:35.050
Oh, yes, I hear that.

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:36.100
No problem.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:41.140
Then, you add a second tone,
maybe a little bit higher

00:31:41.140 --> 00:31:43.922
in frequency than
the probe tone.

00:31:43.922 --> 00:31:46.985
Probe tone was-- let's say,
in this case, 1 kilohertz.

00:31:48.050 --> 00:31:54.730
The second tone, masker tone
is 1.5 kilohertz, let's say.

00:31:54.730 --> 00:31:56.550
Introduce that.

00:31:56.550 --> 00:31:58.530
Person, yeah, I still
hear the probe tone.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:31:59.977
I hear this other tone too.

00:31:59.977 --> 00:32:01.310
Oh, don't pay attention to that.

00:32:01.310 --> 00:32:02.680
Just listen to the probe tone.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:03.870
Sure, I hear that.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:06.700
Then, you boost the level
of that second masker tone

00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.950
up to, in this case, 90 dB.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:12.089
The person says, I can't
hear that probe tone anymore.

00:32:12.089 --> 00:32:12.880
Can you turn it up?

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.110
And you plot that on your graph.

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:16.920
That's a hit.

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.180
That's a point.

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:22.510
In that case, the masker has
made inaudible the probe.

00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:26.200
And you go on varying your
frequencies and levels

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:30.165
until that masker masks
the probe and the person

00:32:30.165 --> 00:32:31.870
says I can't hear
the probe anymore.

00:32:31.870 --> 00:32:35.290
And you get the so-called
psychophysical tuning curve,

00:32:35.290 --> 00:32:38.280
which has this
very nice tip to it

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.650
and a long low frequency tail
from a normal hearing person.

00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:46.530
But a person with a
sensorineural hearing loss

00:32:46.530 --> 00:32:49.450
often has a psychophysical
tuning curve like this.

00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.260
This should remind you
of the tuning curves

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.760
that we just saw from
auditory nerve fibers

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.290
in the damaged cochlea, which
is basically a tipless tuning

00:33:00.290 --> 00:33:00.790
curve.

00:33:02.150 --> 00:33:04.620
Perhaps in this case,
the outer hair cells

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.610
have been damaged
by fun with sounds,

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.990
and you have just the
tail of the tuning curve.

00:33:13.260 --> 00:33:16.310
Now, here we come
to the crux of why,

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:19.090
in this person who has
a sensorineural hearing

00:33:19.090 --> 00:33:22.040
loss-- they still
have hearing, but they

00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:26.970
have a big loss-- why won't
just a hearing aid work?

00:33:26.970 --> 00:33:29.330
You can certainly
install a hearing aid

00:33:29.330 --> 00:33:33.980
into this person's ear canal
and boost their threshold

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.180
from what they used
to here down at 0

00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:39.380
dB to what they
now here at 60 dB

00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.750
You can amplify
the sound at 60 dB.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:42.940
OK, fine.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:46.020
Then, they'll start to say,
yeah, I here it no problem.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:49.770
What happens when this person
goes to a crowded restaurant,

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:52.030
and there's all this
low frequency DIN?

00:33:53.510 --> 00:33:58.160
Well before, all the low
frequency DIN was here.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.560
It didn't get into
the response area

00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.880
of the sharply
tuned tuning curve.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.700
Now, you have all
this low frequencies

00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:09.790
that's amplified
by the hearing aid.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.880
It now gets into the response
area of the nerve fiber.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.980
That low frequency
signal, which you

00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.469
don't want to pay attention
to because you're listening

00:34:18.469 --> 00:34:23.150
at 1 kilohertz, is a
competing, or masking, stimulus

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:24.929
along with the signal.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:29.120
And so now, the person with the
hearing aid and sensorineural

00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.840
hearing loss goes into
the crowded restaurant

00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:35.580
and says I hear very well, but
I can't understand the person

00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.830
across the table speaking to me.

00:34:37.830 --> 00:34:39.870
All I hear is this big noise.

00:34:39.870 --> 00:34:43.120
And no matter what I-- how
I adjust my hearing aid,

00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.370
it just sounds noisy.

00:34:44.370 --> 00:34:46.020
I can't understand anymore.

00:34:46.020 --> 00:34:47.000
I can hear.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.810
They're certainly not deaf, but
they can't understand anymore

00:34:50.810 --> 00:34:55.560
because before they had
sharply tuned frequency tuning,

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.995
and now they have no
frequency tuning at all.

00:34:57.995 --> 00:34:59.080
It's very broad.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:02.230
That's the problem
that a hearing aid

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:06.590
can't deal with in terms
of restoring normal hearing

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:09.060
to a person with
sensorineural hearing loss.

00:35:12.850 --> 00:35:14.860
Before I start to
talk about implants,

00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:19.951
let me just remember to say
what other processes affect

00:35:19.951 --> 00:35:20.450
our hearing.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:28.290
And we have a list just so
I don't forget anything.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:38.540
And one of the important
things is genetic causes.

00:35:41.190 --> 00:35:43.810
So maybe you can't see that
from the back of the room,

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:46.350
but number four here
is genetic causes.

00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:49.390
There are babies
who are born deaf,

00:35:49.390 --> 00:35:52.920
and in the state of
Massachusetts, in most states,

00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:58.630
it's mandatory to test infant
hearing at birth because you

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:02.150
want to install a hearing
aid or install a cochlea

00:36:02.150 --> 00:36:08.120
implant at a young age if
the baby has hearing loss.

00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:13.810
And another cause
that we should list

00:36:13.810 --> 00:36:17.585
are certain kinds of infections
and disease processes.

00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:27.817
Number five, cause of hearing
loss is diseases, for example,

00:36:27.817 --> 00:36:28.316
meningitis.

00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:35.270
And one of the MIT
students that I

00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:38.760
used to use for demonstration
of cochlea implant

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:44.890
is deaf because at age 12, he
got very sick with meningitis.

00:36:44.890 --> 00:36:50.550
And when I asked him,
how did you go deaf?

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.010
He said, well, I got
sick with meningitis.

00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:59.290
And I was so sick that my MD's
treated me with aminoglycosides

00:36:59.290 --> 00:37:02.080
so that they would kill
the meningitis bacteria.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.240
And he isn't sure whether it's
the meningitis or the side

00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:10.070
effect of the aminoglycosides
that made him deaf.

00:37:10.070 --> 00:37:13.370
But when you woke up, he
was cured, but he was deaf.

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:20.580
So in some cases you're not
sure which of these agents

00:37:20.580 --> 00:37:21.620
caused the hearing loss.

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.590
So that's a pretty
complete list now.

00:37:25.590 --> 00:37:29.570
Do we have any questions about
what things cause hearing loss?

00:37:38.010 --> 00:37:42.050
And you might imagine
that, during our lifetime,

00:37:42.050 --> 00:37:47.150
some of these things will be
understood in a better way.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.940
It's clear why loud sound
causes hearing loss.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:52.590
I mean the mechanical action.

00:37:52.590 --> 00:37:54.110
These things are moving.

00:37:54.110 --> 00:37:57.995
You could damage the
very sensitive apparatus,

00:37:57.995 --> 00:37:58.870
like the stereocilia.

00:38:01.320 --> 00:38:04.250
Drugs, aminoglycosides
bind to some

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:06.280
of the membrane
channels in hair cells.

00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:13.780
And maybe a therapy for this
ototoxicity, this hearing loss

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:15.890
created by these
aminoglycosides,

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:21.160
could be to install some
competitive binder that

00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.210
would occupy the binding
sites while you gave the drug

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:24.710
therapy.

00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:30.750
We don't know at all what causes
the hearing loss with aging.

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:35.200
That's a very active
subject in today's research.

00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:39.850
Genetic causes, same
way, usually these

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:44.370
are some sort of developmental
factor or protein

00:38:44.370 --> 00:38:48.780
that's necessary for normal hair
cell development and it's lost,

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.260
in the case of recessive
genetic problem.

00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.390
That's pretty clear
how that arises.

00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:01.820
Meningitis, it's not clear how
those diseases kill hair cells,

00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:02.810
but they certainly do.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.330
But there's certainly
room to imagine

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:11.330
that will be worked on quite
actively in the next 10

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:12.240
or 20 years.

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.560
It's not known right
now how the hair

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.030
cells are lost in meningitis.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:28.460
So let's talk about, now, people
who have complete hearing loss

00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:32.800
and are eligible for
the so-called cochlear

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.480
implants and other types of
implants that restore hearing.

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.790
So this is a nice
slide from, I think,

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.920
the paper that we're
reading for today.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.690
And actually that reminds
me, besides that paper, which

00:39:46.690 --> 00:39:50.020
is a very short
one, easy to read,

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.080
the textbook reading
that I've assigned

00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:54.570
for today, which
is most of chapter

00:39:54.570 --> 00:39:57.340
8 on auditory
prostheses is excellent.

00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:59.160
It's really up to date.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.400
It tells you a lot
about cochlear implants

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.560
and coding for speech,
which I probably

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:06.870
won't have time to get into.

00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:10.660
But this is a really-- I mean
hearing aids past and present,

00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.990
that's not so important.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:13.850
But it has a lot
of good information

00:40:13.850 --> 00:40:17.300
on cochlear implants, so
I'd encourage you definitely

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:19.670
to read that textbook
passage today.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.650
And the research report
by Moore and Shannon

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:28.030
is a very simple,
easy to read paper.

00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:32.050
It shows you the sites where
these various implants go.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.590
So the cochlear
implant, obviously,

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:38.010
is installed into the
cochlea, right here.

00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:43.210
For people who have lost their
hearing because of a problem

00:40:43.210 --> 00:40:47.360
with their auditory nerve,
you put a cochlear implant in,

00:40:47.360 --> 00:40:49.700
and it's not going to do any
good because the messages

00:40:49.700 --> 00:40:52.330
aren't going to be conveyed
by the nerve into the brain.

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:57.330
And so what's an example
of someone like that?

00:40:57.330 --> 00:41:05.620
Well, a disease process
called neurofibromatosis

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:15.140
type two, or NF2, is a disease
process where the subjects get

00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:18.500
tumors that grow
on various nerves.

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:23.250
And a very common type
of tumor in NF2 patients

00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:28.700
is called a
vestibular schwannoma.

00:41:31.710 --> 00:41:35.610
And a schwannoma is a
tumor of the schwann cells

00:41:35.610 --> 00:41:39.210
that normally provide the myelin
covering of peripheral nerves.

00:41:39.210 --> 00:41:41.290
And it grows on the
vestibular branch

00:41:41.290 --> 00:41:43.120
of the eighth cranial nerve.

00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:46.270
Obviously, that's quite
near the auditory branch

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.110
of the eighth cranial nerve.

00:41:48.110 --> 00:41:49.990
And these tumors grow and grow.

00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:52.550
They probably rob the
nerve of the blood supply.

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:54.380
They probably put
pressure on it,

00:41:54.380 --> 00:41:58.030
and they certainly
infiltrate the tumor cells

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.320
in amongst the fibers.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:04.740
And when the surgeon goes in
to remove that type of tumor

00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:07.380
invariably the eighth
cranial nerve is cut.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:13.040
So in that case, the subject
has no nerve conveying messages

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.640
from the cochlea into the brain.

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:18.750
Well, the surgery is right here.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:20.370
You're removing a
tumor from here,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:24.550
so it's fairly easy to go
ahead and install an implant

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.867
into the cochlear
nucleus of the brain.

00:42:27.867 --> 00:42:29.200
The cochlear nucleus is visible.

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.180
And that's what's called an
auditory brainstem implant.

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:36.460
It should be called a
cochlear nucleus implant,

00:42:36.460 --> 00:42:37.418
but it's called an ABI.

00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:44.160
And an ABI-- I'm not going
to talk too much about it--

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:48.400
but just suffice it to say, it's
an array of surface electrodes.

00:42:49.580 --> 00:42:51.670
There are two
companies making these.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:56.360
One has 15, and one has 21
in a checkerboard pattern.

00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:03.510
And the electrodes go onto
the surface of the cochlear

00:43:03.510 --> 00:43:06.865
nucleus, and their placed
there during the surgery.

00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.440
There was an experimental
penetrating electrode array,

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:15.310
or PABI, but that's
been discontinued

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:16.385
because of side effects.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:21.800
Some of these patients
got trigeminal neuralgia,

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:27.790
or pain sensations from nearby
nerves, maybe by the fact

00:43:27.790 --> 00:43:30.075
that these electrodes
penetrated into the brain.

00:43:31.350 --> 00:43:34.560
And so that underwent
an FDA trial,

00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:35.826
but that's no longer used.

00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:42.010
But this surface ABI electrode
is used in cases of NF2

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:45.525
or in other cases where the
nerve function is compromised.

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.770
Those implants don't
work very well.

00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:52.795
So if you look at
this graph here.

00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:56.500
This is a graph of the
different types of implants,

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:58.830
especially I'll call your
attention to the cochlear

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:03.320
implant and the auditory
brain stem implant.

00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.830
In the cochlear
implant, you've got

00:44:05.830 --> 00:44:12.860
a lot of people who can-- if you
do in a word recognition test,

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:16.810
how often they get the
words correct, a lot of them

00:44:16.810 --> 00:44:19.600
are placing at
100% of the words.

00:44:21.490 --> 00:44:25.490
So the task here is you
stand behind the subject,

00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:27.620
or the audiologist stand
behind the subject,

00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:31.410
and they say repeat
after me, baby.

00:44:31.410 --> 00:44:32.745
And the person says baby.

00:44:35.130 --> 00:44:37.505
Sunshine, and the
person says sunshine.

00:44:38.806 --> 00:44:41.370
And the person says, Red Socks.

00:44:41.370 --> 00:44:43.950
And you say, Cardinals.

00:44:43.950 --> 00:44:45.730
And they got one wrong.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:51.390
But anyway, you
can do these tests

00:44:51.390 --> 00:44:54.090
without-- it's important
to stand behind the person

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:55.660
to make sure they're
not lipreading.

00:44:55.660 --> 00:44:57.990
But a lot of cochlear
implant users

00:44:57.990 --> 00:45:01.390
can get 100% on these tests.

00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.070
Now, the ABI, auditory
brain stem implants,

00:45:04.070 --> 00:45:07.950
you've got many of the
subject, if not all of them,

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:12.750
saying the wrong word or not
giving you any response here.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:14.870
So what good is the ABI?

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:20.320
The real success story
of these prostheses

00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:22.940
is that the person
can understand speech.

00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:26.100
If the person can't
understand speech,

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:29.030
this thing isn't doing
them too much good.

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:34.290
So that's not to say
that the ABI isn't

00:45:34.290 --> 00:45:36.700
successful in certain ways.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.815
The ABI is sometimes thought of
as a lipreading assist device.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.900
So it helps these
subjects read lips better.

00:45:46.900 --> 00:45:49.200
For example, if
you guys are deaf

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.530
and you look at my letters, and
I make two different sounds,

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:55.050
pa and ba.

00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.740
That looks exactly the same if
you're trying to read my lips.

00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.485
But it sounds different to you.

00:46:00.485 --> 00:46:02.360
You guys have good
hearing, and it

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:05.840
may sound a little bit
different to the ABI user,

00:46:05.840 --> 00:46:09.990
and it may give that ABI user
a little bit of a step up

00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:14.405
and help versus someone
who's just using lipreading.

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:20.370
Now, just for
completeness, I'll talk

00:46:20.370 --> 00:46:22.305
about the auditory
midbrain implant.

00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.090
The idea here is to put
the implant higher up

00:46:29.090 --> 00:46:29.970
in the pathway.

00:46:29.970 --> 00:46:31.230
Why would you want to do that?

00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:34.110
Well, some people
think that the ABI

00:46:34.110 --> 00:46:37.000
doesn't work because there's
been this tumor here.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:41.780
And surgeon has been hacking on
the tumor to try to get it out,

00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.170
yanking and pulling on it.

00:46:44.170 --> 00:46:46.950
If the tumor didn't damage
the cochlear nucleus,

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:49.810
well, the hacking and
tugging on it did.

00:46:51.060 --> 00:46:53.530
And so maybe you
should put the implant

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.420
further up where
you haven't been

00:46:56.420 --> 00:46:58.120
hacking and everything's normal.

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:02.864
And so that's the idea behind
the auditory midbrain implant,

00:47:02.864 --> 00:47:04.530
which goes into the
inferior colliculus.

00:47:06.010 --> 00:47:11.800
And there have
been five patients

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:13.920
who've gone undergone
the auditory midbrain

00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:17.460
implant-- actually six,
five very well documented.

00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:26.100
And the outcomes have been
no better than the ABI,

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.520
but that's because four out
of the five well-documented

00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:32.335
didn't hit the right spot.

00:47:32.335 --> 00:47:35.340
The inferior colliculus
is pretty small,

00:47:35.340 --> 00:47:38.720
and the part that you
really want to go into

00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:41.365
is the tonotopically
organized spot

00:47:41.365 --> 00:47:46.260
so that this needle
electrode y--

00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.760
this is a long electrode
array with about 16 contacts

00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.810
on it, in this needle.

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:55.890
And that's put into the
tonotopic part of the IC,

00:47:55.890 --> 00:47:58.790
and it didn't get into the
right place in most people.

00:47:58.790 --> 00:48:02.580
But even in the one individual,
got it in the right place,

00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.185
it wasn't any
better than the ABI.

00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.590
But there is going to be another
clinical trial in which they

00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:10.950
implant five more subjects.

00:48:10.950 --> 00:48:13.880
And hopefully, the outcomes
will be better on that.

00:48:16.630 --> 00:48:19.620
So that's the various
types of electrodes.

00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:22.500
And, obviously, the
cochlear implant

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:23.650
is the real winner here.

00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:30.750
And we have been having
readings-- Hi, Sheila-- we've

00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:32.550
been having readings
in our class,

00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:35.160
and I'll do a reading now
about the cochlear implant.

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.880
This is from-- this is
not made into a book form

00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:50.320
yet because this is from the
esteemed academic publication

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:54.055
called Yahoo
Finance, on the web.

00:48:55.370 --> 00:49:03.770
And this is dated
September 9, 2013.

00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:12.540
And the subject of this
column is the Lasker Award.

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:25.671
So the Lasker
Award, does anybody

00:49:25.671 --> 00:49:26.920
know what the Lasker Award is?

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:30.730
Sometimes, called the
American Nobel Prize,

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:32.360
so it's a very
prestigious honor.

00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.670
It's given in several
different fields,

00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:42.740
mostly in medicine
and biomedical areas,

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:45.160
and so there are sub-groups.

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.800
And this one was given in
clinical medical research

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:48.780
award.

00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:55.010
So the 2013 Lasker Clinical
Medical Research Award

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:59.640
honors Graeme Clark, Ingeborg
Hochmair and Blake Wilson

00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.380
for developing the modern
cochlear implant, a device that

00:50:04.380 --> 00:50:07.770
bestows hearing on
profoundly deaf people.

00:50:07.770 --> 00:50:09.520
The apparatus has,
for the first time,

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.570
substantially
restored a human sense

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:14.080
with a medical intervention.

00:50:15.620 --> 00:50:17.160
Blah, blah, blah.

00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:20.230
Throughout the world today,
there are about 320,000 people

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:22.330
outfitted with
cochlear implants.

00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:25.680
Most recipients can
talk on their cellphones

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:29.835
and follow conversations in
relatively quiet environments,

00:50:29.835 --> 00:50:31.740
and an increasing
number of patients

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.080
with severe age-related
hearing loss

00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:36.950
are taking advantage of
this marvelous invention.

00:50:36.950 --> 00:50:40.860
So the three people
here, two of them

00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:45.320
are actually founders of
cochlear implant companies.

00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:50.140
So you can think of Nobel Prizes
and these prize being awarded

00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.900
to people who made
big discoveries.

00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:56.020
And certainly, in the third
case, Blake Wilson did.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:00.530
But in the first two, it's
really conveying a technology

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:04.460
to the masses that was
recognized by this award.

00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:08.220
So that's the 2013 Lasker Award.

00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:13.010
So let's look a little bit about
what a cochlear implant is,

00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:15.200
and that's shown in the
next couple of slides.

00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:21.260
So the cochlear implant
has an internal part, which

00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:25.310
is a series of electrodes
that go into the cochlea,

00:51:25.310 --> 00:51:31.200
and the electrode
comes out from here

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:34.650
and goes into a
so-called internal coil--

00:51:34.650 --> 00:51:42.440
sorry about that-- and this is
sometimes called the receiver

00:51:42.440 --> 00:51:45.190
because it gets messages
from the external coil,

00:51:45.190 --> 00:51:49.050
or sometimes called the
transmitter, across the skin

00:51:49.050 --> 00:51:49.560
here.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:53.485
So there's skin between the
external and internal coils.

00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:57.130
On the outside, you
have a microphone

00:51:57.130 --> 00:52:02.410
which picks up the sound and
sends the microphone messages

00:52:02.410 --> 00:52:04.495
to a so-called speech processor.

00:52:05.640 --> 00:52:09.650
The speech processor
sends transforms

00:52:09.650 --> 00:52:14.770
that sound wave form into a
series of electrical pulses

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:16.990
that are sent down
the electrodes

00:52:16.990 --> 00:52:19.120
and stimulate the
remaining auditory nerve

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:20.820
fibers in the cochlea.

00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:26.070
So the cochlear implant has the
electrodes, the internal part,

00:52:26.070 --> 00:52:28.210
the external part, and
the speech processor

00:52:28.210 --> 00:52:29.325
and microphone.

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:36.460
And I have a demonstration
cochlear implant here.

00:52:36.460 --> 00:52:39.070
And I'm going to pass it around.

00:52:39.070 --> 00:52:43.330
These things are very valuable,
so as demonstration models,

00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:44.680
they strip off the electrodes.

00:52:46.690 --> 00:52:48.550
So the part I'm
passing around is just

00:52:48.550 --> 00:52:50.990
this tube that goes
down here but not

00:52:50.990 --> 00:52:53.450
the electrodes
themselves, and I think

00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:57.190
it has the internal and
external coil, and obviously not

00:52:57.190 --> 00:52:59.140
the microphone or
the speech processor,

00:52:59.140 --> 00:53:02.270
so just to give you
an idea of the size.

00:53:02.270 --> 00:53:05.240
And I think this one,
the tube comes down,

00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.680
and it coils around a
little like the electrodes

00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.240
do as they coil in the cochlea.

00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.100
Now, this next slide
is pretty important

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:18.230
because it shows the
electrodes coming

00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:20.410
into the cochlea in
a cutaway diagram.

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:25.790
And so the electrodes come in
the basal turn of the cochlea.

00:53:25.790 --> 00:53:28.610
Remember there's an
area in the bone that

00:53:28.610 --> 00:53:31.940
has a little membrane over
it called the round window.

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:35.280
Surgeons can go in there and
make a tear in round window

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.300
and put the implant in there.

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.290
Or, they can drill
a hole a little bit

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:41.340
apical from the round
window and start

00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:43.370
in the base of
the cochlea, which

00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:47.700
is the big part of
the cochlea and then

00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:53.180
thread just by pushing
the electrode array more

00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:55.640
and more apical
into the cochlea.

00:53:55.640 --> 00:54:00.475
Now, the cochlea gets pretty
small as it goes very apically.

00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:07.020
And the electrodes don't fit
into the apical region so far.

00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.210
So current cochlear
implants only

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:14.370
can be pushed in about to cover
the basal half of the cochlea,

00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.320
the basal 50%.

00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:20.400
So that seems like
a huge limitation.

00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:21.525
It's a bit of a limitation.

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.710
Fortunately, it's not
an extreme limitation

00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:30.350
because the spiral ganglion
doesn't go all the way

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:31.910
to the apical part
of the cochlea.

00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:35.090
The ganglion is where the cell
bodies of the auditory nerve

00:54:35.090 --> 00:54:36.090
is.

00:54:36.090 --> 00:54:40.790
And so there is ganglion that
ends about 3/4 of the way out,

00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:43.090
so the last quarter
wouldn't be helpful anyway.

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:47.030
And here are the
various electrodes

00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:49.370
along the cochlear implant.

00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:52.655
And modern cochlear
implants have 22 electrodes.

00:54:57.710 --> 00:55:01.690
And they are hooked up.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:03.977
I'll show you how they're
hooked up in just a minute.

00:55:03.977 --> 00:55:06.310
Actually, I'll show you how
they're hooked up right now.

00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:12.940
The way this works is
the microphone signal

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:16.210
comes into the speech
processor here,

00:55:16.210 --> 00:55:20.950
and the microphone signal is
split up into various bands.

00:55:20.950 --> 00:55:24.160
The microphone might pick
up only high frequency,

00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:27.170
in which case, this
band would be active,

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:29.920
or it might pick up middle
frequencies, in which case

00:55:29.920 --> 00:55:34.180
these bands would be active, or
it might pick up low frequency

00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:35.810
or it might pick
up all frequencies.

00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:38.760
It depends on what the sound is.

00:55:40.060 --> 00:55:43.660
The output of those filters
is sent to some processing

00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:49.240
schemes, which eventually result
in little electric pulses,

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:53.100
and those are shocks
that are sent down

00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:55.740
into the cochlear
implant electrodes.

00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.920
And this is supposed
to be-- actually

00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.795
something's not happening
here automatically.

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.910
This is supposed to be
electrode number one, which

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:08.540
is the most apical electrode,
and so on and so forth.

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:12.030
And this scheme only
ends in electrode 18,

00:56:12.030 --> 00:56:15.820
so this is an old diagram
here because current cochlear

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:16.670
implants have 22.

00:56:19.480 --> 00:56:23.320
So if you are hearing
very low frequencies,

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:26.005
you're going to be stimulating
very apical electrodes.

00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:29.500
And if you're hearing
the highest frequencies,

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.680
you're going to stimulate
the most basal electrode.

00:56:31.680 --> 00:56:35.250
And this is a recapitulation
of the place code

00:56:35.250 --> 00:56:42.340
for sound frequency where base
of the cochlear transduces

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.940
in normal hearing, the high
frequencies, and the apex

00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:47.310
transduces the low frequencies.

00:56:47.310 --> 00:56:49.850
So when we said the
cochlear implant doesn't

00:56:49.850 --> 00:56:52.360
go all the way apically,
it can't fit there.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:53.260
So what happens?

00:56:53.260 --> 00:56:55.540
Well, the apex isn't
very well-stimulated

00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:56.740
in these designs.

00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:00.540
And so you will
hear descriptions

00:57:00.540 --> 00:57:05.080
of people who have their implant
turned on for the first time,

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.210
and they'll say it
sounds like Donald Duck.

00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.730
It sounds really shrill
and very high-pitched.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.970
Well, a lot of the apex-- not
drawn here-- is not stimulated.

00:57:15.730 --> 00:57:17.090
So what happens?

00:57:17.090 --> 00:57:19.490
So these people,
after a month or two,

00:57:19.490 --> 00:57:22.040
say oh, yeah, it's
sounding better and better.

00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:27.980
And so there's some sort
of learning or plasticity

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:30.090
that makes things settle
down, and the voices

00:57:30.090 --> 00:57:33.260
sound a little bit more
normal, maybe not normal,

00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:34.310
but more normal.

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:39.510
And perfectly, as you saw
from the graph before,

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:42.710
normal word
recognition scores can

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:44.490
be achieved even though
you're stimulating

00:57:44.490 --> 00:57:46.010
just a portion of the cochlea.

00:57:48.830 --> 00:57:54.330
Now, I have a movie here,
and this gets on my nerves,

00:57:54.330 --> 00:57:56.400
but I want to show it
to you because this

00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.610
is what's shown to
patients who are

00:57:58.610 --> 00:57:59.990
about to get a cochlear implant.

00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.230
Gets on my nerves because you
see hair cells in here that

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.610
have stereocilia that
are just waving around,

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:08.575
but the stereocilia
are really rigid.

00:58:10.077 --> 00:58:12.160
But anyway, I thought it
would be interesting just

00:58:12.160 --> 00:58:19.380
to see what someone sees
when they are getting

00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:22.500
this stuff from a
cochlear implant.

00:58:22.500 --> 00:58:24.060
Let's see if this
movie will play.

00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:33.042
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]
In normal hearing,

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:35.292
the hair in the inner ear--

00:58:35.292 --> 00:58:36.250
PROFESSOR: I hate this.

00:58:39.290 --> 00:58:41.230
I mean the best
membranes way over here.

00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:42.176
The hair cells--

00:58:42.176 --> 00:58:44.160
-The hearing nerve still
remains functional,

00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.128
but the hair cells have
been lost or damaged.

00:58:48.128 --> 00:58:52.592
In a cochlear implant system,
sound enters a microphone

00:58:52.592 --> 00:58:55.072
and travels to an
external mini computer

00:58:55.072 --> 00:58:57.056
called a sound processor.

00:58:57.056 --> 00:58:59.040
The sound is processed
and converted

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:01.520
into digital information.

00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:04.992
This digital information is
sent over a transmitter antenna

00:59:04.992 --> 00:59:07.472
to the surgically implanted
part of the system.

00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:11.936
The implant will turn
the sound information

00:59:11.936 --> 00:59:14.912
into electrical signals
that travel down

00:59:14.912 --> 00:59:17.888
to an electrode array inserted
into the tiny inner ear.

00:59:22.848 --> 00:59:25.824
The electrodes directly
stimulate the auditory nerve,

00:59:25.824 --> 00:59:28.304
sending sound
information to the brain.

00:59:30.288 --> 00:59:33.760
Bypassing the damaged inner
ear, the cochlear implant

00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:37.232
provides an entirely new
mechanism for hearing.

00:59:40.208 --> 00:59:41.430
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:43.360
PROFESSOR: So that's
what the patient's see.

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:47.640
And how well does it work?

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.490
So we can ask a demonstrator
that we have today.

00:59:51.490 --> 00:59:54.540
Sheila come on up in
front of the class.

00:59:54.540 --> 01:00:00.855
This is Sheila [? Zu ?],
who is a MIT undergraduate.

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:03.900
You're a senior now, right?

01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:09.625
What's your major at MIT?

01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:11.970
SHEILA: I'm the only
in this major at MIT.

01:00:11.970 --> 01:00:14.330
I'm in [INAUDIBLE]
technology and [? society ?]

01:00:14.330 --> 01:00:17.470
and [INAUDIBLE] is a joint
major between Humanities

01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:18.220
and [? Chinese. ?]

01:00:18.892 --> 01:00:20.350
PROFESSOR: Are you
an overachiever?

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:23.025
SHEILA: I don't know.

01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:23.525
Maybe.

01:00:25.900 --> 01:00:28.260
PROFESSOR: So has
anybody in the class

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:31.035
ever spoken to a cochlear
implant user before?

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:34.380
SHEILA: I know some of them.

01:00:34.380 --> 01:00:36.184
PROFESSOR: You know
some of these people?

01:00:36.184 --> 01:00:39.420
SHEILA: We're in the same dorm.
[INAUDIBLE] in my sorority.

01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:39.920
OK.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:41.100
Great!

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:45.530
So we can do this
whatever way you want to.

01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:48.240
You can ask Sheila
questions if you've already

01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:49.287
asked them to her.

01:00:49.287 --> 01:00:50.245
I'll ask her questions.

01:00:51.947 --> 01:00:53.280
Does anybody have any questions?

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:57.380
Yes?

01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:59.640
AUDIENCE: How old were you
when you got your implant?

01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:04.015
SHEILA: So I was born
deaf, but I got implant

01:01:04.015 --> 01:01:05.500
when I was 3 years old.

01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:09.370
Actually, I got surgery
when I was 2 years old.

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:12.580
[INAUDIBLE] when
I was 3 years old.

01:01:14.290 --> 01:01:16.210
PROFESSOR: So one
question I often

01:01:16.210 --> 01:01:22.560
get about implants into children
is how young can a child be

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.660
and still be implanted
successfully.

01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:27.520
So the surgeons at
Mass Eye and Ear

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:32.630
say that the cochlea is
adult size by age 1 and 1/2,

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:37.430
so typically, that's the age
when a person who is born deaf

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:39.570
is implanted these
days, age 1 and 1/2.

01:01:39.570 --> 01:01:44.120
The idea to implant early
is so that the subject

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:47.000
can grow up and enjoy
normal hearing, especially

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.880
during a critical period for
language formation, which

01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:54.680
was maybe starting at
1 and 1/2, 2 years old.

01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:57.680
So if you implant a person
later, in their teens,

01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:01.122
and they haven't
heard sound, they

01:02:01.122 --> 01:02:05.520
have a lot worse chances of
acquiring normal language

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.388
skills than someone like Sheila
who has been implanted early.

01:02:09.388 --> 01:02:12.570
So the trend is to try to
implant as early as possible.

01:02:14.546 --> 01:02:18.127
SHEILA: I want to point out that
I may have been implanted when

01:02:18.127 --> 01:02:19.980
I was 3 years old,
but I didn't start

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.450
speaking until I was
about 5 years old.

01:02:22.450 --> 01:02:24.920
And I didn't start
learning math or learning

01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:27.250
how to read until I was 7
years old, so I was really

01:02:27.250 --> 01:02:28.516
delayed back then.

01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.070
PROFESSOR: Did you
have a question?

01:02:34.070 --> 01:02:35.820
AUDIENCE: So I was
just wondering, are you

01:02:35.820 --> 01:02:37.910
like reading my lips right now?

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:39.070
SHEILA: Yes, I am.

01:02:39.070 --> 01:02:42.780
So the way it works, I
have to see people's face,

01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.900
like how to read their lips, and
I listen too at the same time.

01:02:46.940 --> 01:02:50.670
I could read your lips alone,
but maybe not 100% accurate.

01:02:51.706 --> 01:02:54.270
Or, if I don't look at you
lip, and listen to you,

01:02:54.270 --> 01:02:56.690
maybe not really
understandable, so it's

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:59.790
like I have to read lips
and listen at the same time

01:02:59.790 --> 01:03:01.770
in order to understand you.

01:03:01.770 --> 01:03:06.570
PROFESSOR: But if you don't
read lips, for example,

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:09.220
in situations like
talking on the telephone,

01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.270
can you understand
someone on the telephone?

01:03:11.270 --> 01:03:13.445
SHEILA: It depends
on the person.

01:03:13.445 --> 01:03:16.760
If I'm familiar with your voice,
like I know my dad's voice.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:18.900
I can understand
him pretty well,

01:03:18.900 --> 01:03:23.290
but if I'm talking to a stranger
on the phone, then maybe not.

01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:25.955
And also, don't forget, there's
a lot of background noises,

01:03:25.955 --> 01:03:28.968
so that makes it harder for me
to hear people on the phone.

01:03:31.960 --> 01:03:36.440
PROFESSOR: When I-- let's say
about 10 years ago in my lab,

01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:40.390
I hired a research assistant
who used a cochlear implant,

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:43.630
and she wanted me to
shave off my mustache.

01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.880
It was because she had
a little trouble reading

01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:52.070
my lips with my mustache.

01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:56.010
Now, my wife also has told
me I should shave a mustache,

01:03:56.010 --> 01:03:57.243
but she has normal hearing.

01:04:00.624 --> 01:04:02.790
SHEILA: I actually
had a professor at MIT

01:04:02.790 --> 01:04:06.000
when I was a freshman,
I comment one day I

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.820
had hard time understanding
him because he

01:04:07.820 --> 01:04:08.736
had like a full beard.

01:04:09.534 --> 01:04:11.552
Then, next day, he
shaved off everything.

01:04:11.552 --> 01:04:14.444
So he came up to me, I
was like, who are you?

01:04:16.836 --> 01:04:17.336
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:20.114 --> 01:04:21.280
PROFESSOR: That's very nice.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.170
Wow, interesting!

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:27.360
I didn't shave off my mustache,
neither for my assistant,

01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.612
nor for my wife.

01:04:28.612 --> 01:04:30.070
SHEILA: [INAUDIBLE]
half is better.

01:04:31.412 --> 01:04:32.120
PROFESSOR: Maybe.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:32.620
Yeah.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:41.690
So if an audiologist were to
test your speech comprehension,

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:44.880
do you think you'd
get every word correct

01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:46.440
or do you think you'd miss some?

01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:49.540
SHEILA: I think I
probably miss some words

01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:52.600
or may not pronounce
some words correctly,

01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.985
because the way I hear
words may sound differently

01:04:55.985 --> 01:04:57.340
from what you hear.

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.020
And sometimes, in
English language,

01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.560
some words don't sound exactly
the way it's written down.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:07.600
So I think my speech is
not bad because, based

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.942
on my interaction
with people, they

01:05:09.942 --> 01:05:11.566
seem to understand
me most of the time.

01:05:14.006 --> 01:05:14.982
Yeah?

01:05:14.982 --> 01:05:16.934
AUDIENCE: Do you know
any other languages?

01:05:16.934 --> 01:05:19.362
SHEILA: I know another language.

01:05:19.362 --> 01:05:19.862
Yeah.

01:05:19.862 --> 01:05:21.920
I know a couple of languages.

01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:23.920
I know American sign language.

01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:26.880
I use it often to
help, in some cases,

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:29.040
when cochlear
implant don't work.

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:32.400
For example, if I'm
in a loud bar or party

01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.977
and I can't hear people,
but if I use sign language,

01:05:34.977 --> 01:05:35.810
I understand people.

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:39.196
I know British
sign language too,

01:05:39.196 --> 01:05:40.570
but that's another
sign language.

01:05:42.600 --> 01:05:46.180
PROFESSOR: So you mentioned
when you're in a party

01:05:46.180 --> 01:05:50.650
and you can't hear people,
does that mean that there's

01:05:50.650 --> 01:05:55.490
a lot of noise that
masks speakers and that's

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:57.964
a hard situation for you?

01:05:57.964 --> 01:05:59.257
Right.

01:05:59.257 --> 01:06:00.715
SHEILA: So like
the speaker's voice

01:06:00.715 --> 01:06:05.210
will blend into other speakers
voices or background noises,

01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:08.255
so I tend to rely on
lipreading or some other method

01:06:08.255 --> 01:06:08.880
to communicate.

01:06:11.442 --> 01:06:12.150
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:16.820
So for example, in
cochlear implants,

01:06:16.820 --> 01:06:21.920
a common problem is when
there is an environment where

01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:25.420
there's many, many
frequencies of sound,

01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:28.790
like a crowded
restaurant or a party,

01:06:28.790 --> 01:06:32.780
and there's one speaker that
you're trying to pay attention

01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:38.460
to and the subject
gets overloaded

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.560
on every single electrode.

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:46.010
And so some kinds of
cochlear implant processors

01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:50.680
try to circumvent that by trying
to pick out in the spectrum

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:53.420
the important peaks
of the spectrum.

01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.810
So if you're listening
to the vowel aa,

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:57.220
you'd have three formants.

01:06:58.660 --> 01:07:02.720
The processor tries to pick
out those formants and only

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.490
present electrodes
corresponding to those formants

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:10.610
and turn all the other
electrodes off so that there's

01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:14.055
a huge difference between
where the formant is

01:07:14.055 --> 01:07:15.660
and where the nothing is.

01:07:15.660 --> 01:07:17.739
Really in theory, it's
nothing, but actually, it

01:07:17.739 --> 01:07:18.905
could be a noisy background.

01:07:20.050 --> 01:07:24.250
So that is one kind of
speech processor design.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:27.750
It's called the speech
feature extractor, sometimes

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:28.880
the speak chip.

01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.290
It's trying to pick
out formants so

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:33.460
that it can understand vowels.

01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:37.090
And it's supposed to be less
sensitive to noise masking,

01:07:37.090 --> 01:07:39.635
which is a huge problem
in cochlear implants.

01:07:40.726 --> 01:07:44.450
A cochlear implant user doesn't
have the sharply tuned filter

01:07:44.450 --> 01:07:46.910
of the normal
auditory nerve tuning

01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:50.400
curve that normal
hearing people do.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.280
What about listening to music?

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.419
Do you listen to music?

01:07:54.419 --> 01:07:54.960
SHEILA: Yeah.

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.640
Like last month, I went
to hear Yo-Yo Ma play.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:01.980
Like when-- I can hear
music, but I'm not sure.

01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:04.680
I think I hear music
differently from you guys

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.856
because there's a whole
range of frequencies,

01:08:06.856 --> 01:08:10.000
like you said, but yeah
I can listen to music.

01:08:11.896 --> 01:08:14.266
AUDIENCE: How often do you
go to the doctor for updates?

01:08:19.829 --> 01:08:21.670
SHEILA: How often do I go to--

01:08:21.670 --> 01:08:22.700
AUDIENCE: You're doctor.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:24.075
SHEILA: Oh, you
mean audiologist.

01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:29.045
I see audiologist like
maybe once every year just

01:08:29.045 --> 01:08:31.630
for a checkup and remapping.

01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:34.970
PROFESSOR: So do
you get a remapping

01:08:34.970 --> 01:08:36.979
or do they just bill
your insurance company?

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:37.520
SHEILA: Yeah.

01:08:39.763 --> 01:08:40.388
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:08:40.388 --> 01:08:42.300
SHEILA: It's expensive.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.590
PROFESSOR: But do
they-- do you know

01:08:44.590 --> 01:08:48.600
if they change the mapping
for your electrodes?

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:51.630
SHEILA: Yeah, they change
it, but they told me

01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:54.084
it's not really
a lot of changes.

01:08:54.084 --> 01:08:57.180
So I think the older
you get, the less change

01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.901
is made than when
you were younger.

01:08:58.901 --> 01:08:59.942
PROFESSOR: Perhaps, yeah.

01:09:01.170 --> 01:09:03.510
So that's interesting.

01:09:03.510 --> 01:09:06.100
So how do they do that mapping?

01:09:07.670 --> 01:09:13.410
Do they say here's electrode
1, and then here's electrode 2.

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:14.819
Which is higher?

01:09:14.819 --> 01:09:15.700
Do they do that?

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:19.029
SHEILA: Yeah, so I had to go
into a special sound booth.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:22.949
So it's like a cell that
is completely soundproof.

01:09:24.010 --> 01:09:26.840
And they will test me
on a bunch of sounds

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.229
like saying stop
if it's too loud,

01:09:29.229 --> 01:09:32.340
or which one is
louder or softer,

01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:34.920
can you repeat words
after me, and so on.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:39.700
And they use all of that
input to create a new map.

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:40.870
PROFESSOR: Interesting.

01:09:40.870 --> 01:09:44.550
So apparently with
cochlear implant users,

01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:46.450
the frequency mapping
of the electrodes

01:09:46.450 --> 01:09:48.500
doesn't change in a big way.

01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:51.210
But in the auditory
brain stem implant,

01:09:51.210 --> 01:09:55.410
they go through yearly checkups
and, evidently, the mapping

01:09:55.410 --> 01:09:57.415
can change a great deal.

01:09:57.415 --> 01:09:59.400
So it's completely different.

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.730
In cochlear implants, usually
the most apical electrode

01:10:02.730 --> 01:10:05.900
evokes the lowest
sensation of pitch

01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:09.301
and more basal electrodes get
higher and higher sensations

01:10:09.301 --> 01:10:09.800
of pitch.

01:10:12.468 --> 01:10:14.509
AUDIENCE: How easy is it
for you to differentiate

01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:15.982
between two voices?

01:10:15.982 --> 01:10:20.892
Like if you didn't see who was
talking and if I said something

01:10:20.892 --> 01:10:22.856
and then Professor
[? Brown ?] said something,

01:10:22.856 --> 01:10:25.802
how different would our
voices sound to you?

01:10:25.802 --> 01:10:30.010
SHEILA: His voice is deeper,
and you're farther away from me.

01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:34.540
So I think I can tell the
difference between you two.

01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:37.630
I can tell difference between
male and female voices.

01:10:39.052 --> 01:10:39.760
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.920
Female voices sound
higher usually.

01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:42.920
SHEILA: Higher pictched.

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:43.420
Yeah.

01:10:45.434 --> 01:10:47.100
PROFESSOR: Do you
know Mandarin Chinese?

01:10:48.535 --> 01:10:49.660
SHEILA: Yeah, a little bit.

01:10:49.660 --> 01:10:51.740
I can speak some
Chinese, but not

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:56.130
so good because I haven't
used Chinese for a long time.

01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.564
PROFESSOR: It's a
tonal language, right?

01:10:58.564 --> 01:10:59.105
SHEILA: Yeah.

01:10:59.105 --> 01:10:59.440
Oh my God!

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.731
PROFESSOR: Does that give you--

01:11:03.465 --> 01:11:06.810
SHEILA: It's like I went
to China 4 years ago.

01:11:06.810 --> 01:11:08.310
I stayed in China
for about a month.

01:11:08.310 --> 01:11:09.890
So my grandma,
she couldn't speak

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:11.895
English, so I had to
speak to her in Chinese.

01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:16.820
But it's interesting how
it's-- when I talk to people,

01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:20.440
like when I speak myself, I have
to remember how use the tones,

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:24.141
but if I listen to them, I can't
tell the difference between

01:11:24.141 --> 01:11:24.640
tone.

01:11:24.640 --> 01:11:28.050
So what I do is I read
their lips and listen.

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:32.810
And I use context clues
like so if the sound goes

01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:35.290
with this sound,
so I think those

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:37.945
sounds form a certain word.

01:11:37.945 --> 01:11:40.740
That's how I did,
but I believe I

01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:43.750
can learn Chinese with
a matter of practice

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:45.050
and getting used to the sound.

01:11:46.762 --> 01:11:50.800
PROFESSOR: Apparently,
cochlear implant users

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:54.510
have a lot of problems
with melodic intervals,

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:58.110
octave matches, and
tonal languages.

01:11:58.110 --> 01:12:02.360
The temporal code
for frequency that

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:05.370
helps us appreciate
musical intervals

01:12:05.370 --> 01:12:08.670
is not present at all
in any cochlear implant

01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:09.750
scheme that's used now.

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:15.210
So you only have the place
code for sound frequencies,

01:12:15.210 --> 01:12:18.990
you don't have the timing code
in current generation cochlear

01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:19.820
implant users.

01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:22.970
And so the goal,
remember, is to allow

01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:25.200
the users to understand speech.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:30.830
It's not in terms of
recognizing musical intervals.

01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:35.910
Now, if cochlear implant
companies were based in China,

01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:38.980
maybe the goal of
understanding Mandarin Chinese,

01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:42.425
which is total, would be
more important, but so far,

01:12:42.425 --> 01:12:43.300
that hasn't happened.

01:12:45.022 --> 01:12:46.438
AUDIENCE: Are you
more comfortable

01:12:46.438 --> 01:12:49.896
with speaking with people
or are you more comfortable

01:12:49.896 --> 01:12:52.370
with not speaking with people?

01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:54.430
SHEILA: Well, I'm
more comfortable using

01:12:54.430 --> 01:12:57.750
sign language, but I don't mind
going up in front of people

01:12:57.750 --> 01:12:58.460
and speaking.

01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:06.610
PROFESSOR: So one time,
I had a demonstrator

01:13:06.610 --> 01:13:08.350
get asked this question.

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.110
What's the stupidest
thing you've ever

01:13:10.110 --> 01:13:11.640
done with your cochlear implant?

01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:15.510
And he had a
response right away.

01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:19.490
He said when I first got my
implant, I went to the beach.

01:13:19.490 --> 01:13:22.830
And I was 13 years old, and
I was a typical teenager.

01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:25.615
And I saw someone else
with a cochlear implant,

01:13:25.615 --> 01:13:26.990
and that was great
because it was

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:29.620
the first person
I had ever seen.

01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.890
And so I said, let's
swap processors.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.830
And that was actually
a very stupid thing

01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:39.530
to do because each cochlear
implant user is not

01:13:39.530 --> 01:13:43.290
only programmed for their
coding for frequency,

01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:47.935
but they're coding for how much
shock goes into auditory nerve.

01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:51.120
And some people
who have electrodes

01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:54.770
close to the auditory nerve
don't need much current all,

01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:58.060
but if your electrode is far
away you need a lot of current.

01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:00.900
And this fellow got
a processor that

01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:02.980
had been dialed in
a lot of current,

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:05.130
and so he got a big
severe shock when

01:14:05.130 --> 01:14:08.380
you turn the other person's
cochlear implant on.

01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:13.025
So that's something they
tell you not to do, right?

01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:17.410
SHEILA: I don't think
anybody told me that.

01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:20.320
But clearly I was like,
OK, total wipe out.

01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.252
That's a bad shock.

01:14:21.252 --> 01:14:22.460
PROFESSOR: You did that also?

01:14:22.460 --> 01:14:23.832
SHEILA: Well, we both did.

01:14:23.832 --> 01:14:25.040
We exchange at the same time.

01:14:28.850 --> 01:14:31.450
PROFESSOR: Kids don't usually
listen to adults, right?

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.230
So are there a lot
of students at MIT

01:14:37.230 --> 01:14:38.650
who use a cochlear implant?

01:14:40.336 --> 01:14:43.805
SHEILA: So far, by now,
I think I'm the only one.

01:14:43.805 --> 01:14:47.210
But last year, there were
two of us, but he graduated.

01:14:47.210 --> 01:14:48.950
So this year, I'm the only one.

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:50.620
But I'm not the
only deaf student.

01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:52.680
There are like two or
three other deaf student,

01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:54.432
but they wear hearing aids.

01:14:57.700 --> 01:14:59.040
PROFESSOR: Question.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.200
AUDIENCE: How often
do you turn it off--

01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.420
or how often is it off?

01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:05.580
SHEILA: Oh, I turn
it off every night.

01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:08.372
[INAUDIBLE] I go to
bed because there's

01:15:08.372 --> 01:15:09.830
no point when I go
to sleep, right?

01:15:11.141 --> 01:15:13.010
And when I take a
shower or go swimming

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:16.680
or if I want to have
a [INAUDIBLE] day.

01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:18.970
On campus sometimes,
I would get so tired

01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:22.079
of listening to people,
I would just take it off.

01:15:24.450 --> 01:15:26.780
PROFESSOR: Which classes
do you turn it on

01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.595
and which classes
do you turn it off?

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:32.500
That's OK.

01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:37.284
How long does your battery last?

01:15:37.284 --> 01:15:42.390
SHEILA: My battery last like 3
or 4 days, disposable battery,

01:15:42.390 --> 01:15:46.280
3 or 4 days, but rechargeable
battery it's like one day.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:51.470
PROFESSOR: And do
you have an implant

01:15:51.470 --> 01:15:54.450
on one side only, or both sides?

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:58.370
SHEILA: In my right
ear, it's just one side.

01:15:58.370 --> 01:16:01.300
PROFESSOR: Are you going
to get it in the other ear?

01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:04.150
SHEILA: I'm not so sure
because it takes time.

01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:09.480
I had to go through a surgery,
to see doctors, and so

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:12.570
on, so I'm not sure at that
time because I'm so busy at MIT.

01:16:16.305 --> 01:16:19.275
AUDIENCE: What kind of alarm
clock helps you to wake up?

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:27.740
PROFESSOR: Do you
have an alarm clock?

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:28.740
SHEILA: Oh, yes.

01:16:28.740 --> 01:16:31.300
I have a special alarm clock.

01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.270
So I know you guys
use a typical alarm.

01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:35.290
They make loud noises.

01:16:35.290 --> 01:16:40.760
But for me, I use alarm
clock and a flashing lamp,

01:16:40.760 --> 01:16:44.785
so it just flash light on
me that helps to wake me up.

01:16:44.785 --> 01:16:47.440
But some other people say
it doesn't work for them,

01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:49.770
so what they do, they take
a small vibrator thing

01:16:49.770 --> 01:16:52.200
and tuck it under their
pillow or mattress,

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.650
so it's like that then
shocks them awake.

01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:04.990
PROFESSOR: What other
kinds of problems

01:17:04.990 --> 01:17:07.895
do you have with your
implant besides noise?

01:17:13.190 --> 01:17:15.946
SHEILA: I wish it was really
waterproof because if I

01:17:15.946 --> 01:17:19.240
go swimming with my buddies
who are not deaf, then

01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:20.500
how can I hear them.

01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.260
But right now, it's
like a computer,

01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:26.730
so obviously, I can't
just jump into water.

01:17:30.538 --> 01:17:33.673
AUDIENCE: I was going to ask
who taught you sign language.

01:17:33.673 --> 01:17:35.298
SHEILA: Do you know
some sign language?

01:17:35.298 --> 01:17:37.131
AUDIENCE: A little, but
where did you learn?

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.365
SHEILA: [INAUDIBLE] I learned
when I was here at MIT.

01:17:43.406 --> 01:17:44.930
That was about
like two years ago,

01:17:44.930 --> 01:17:47.622
so I took a class at Harvard.

01:17:47.622 --> 01:17:49.580
And then from there, I
met a lot of deaf people

01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:53.190
here at MIT and
outside of MIT, so I

01:17:53.190 --> 01:17:55.760
was able to be comfortable
in sign language.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.450
I don't know.

01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:57.908
I guess it's not
really hard for me

01:17:57.908 --> 01:17:59.660
to learn sign
language compared to,

01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:03.090
let's say Spanish, because
it's more official.

01:18:03.090 --> 01:18:04.970
You don't need to
listen or speak,

01:18:04.970 --> 01:18:08.416
so it's really like all
hands and [INAUDIBLE].

01:18:08.416 --> 01:18:11.180
So it was pretty natural
for me to pick it up.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:16.690
And I use sign language on a
daily basis with my boyfriend

01:18:16.690 --> 01:18:21.490
or with my friends or whenever
I ASL interpreter for my class.

01:18:23.460 --> 01:18:26.470
PROFESSOR: So you often
have an ASL interpreter?

01:18:26.470 --> 01:18:29.580
SHEILA: Yeah, not all, but
it depends on the class.

01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:34.030
For example, if the class is
math or science lecture based,

01:18:34.030 --> 01:18:37.690
like one hour long lecture,
then I use [INAUDIBLE]

01:18:37.690 --> 01:18:39.610
like real time
closed captioning.

01:18:39.610 --> 01:18:42.690
Someone sit next to me,
and on the computer screen,

01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:45.380
I read whatever professor
saying in real time,

01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:46.880
and that person
type out everything.

01:18:48.120 --> 01:18:52.930
Another class, like more of
a lab or a hands on class

01:18:52.930 --> 01:18:55.980
or more moving around,
then I use ASL interpreter

01:18:55.980 --> 01:18:59.248
because it's just awkward to
carry around a laptop reading

01:18:59.248 --> 01:19:00.224
words on a screen.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.950
PROFESSOR: What do you want
to do after you graduate?

01:19:10.676 --> 01:19:12.800
SHEILA: Right now, I'm
applying to one Ph.d program

01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.730
at Harvard that's a
program he is a part of,

01:19:15.730 --> 01:19:19.750
so he may be my
professor next year even.

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:20.690
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:21.420
If you graduate.

01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:30.150
What's the program?

01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:31.630
This is a little sales pitch.

01:19:31.630 --> 01:19:33.031
You can tell them about it.

01:19:34.432 --> 01:19:36.460
SHEILA: The program
is part of Harvard,

01:19:36.460 --> 01:19:38.820
but it was a part of MIT before.

01:19:38.820 --> 01:19:43.010
But it's a Ph.d program
called Speech and Hearing

01:19:43.010 --> 01:19:44.660
Bioscience and Technology.

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.202
Right?

01:19:45.202 --> 01:19:45.910
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:19:45.910 --> 01:19:48.890
SHEILA: And it's a program
that focus on hearing, cochlear

01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:50.880
implant, hearing
aids, or anything

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.530
related to hearing and speech.

01:19:54.018 --> 01:19:56.120
So right now, I'm
applying to that program.

01:19:56.120 --> 01:19:58.400
We'll see how it goes.

01:19:58.400 --> 01:19:59.066
PROFESSOR: Good.

01:20:02.503 --> 01:20:05.449
AUDIENCE: This is personal,
but did your boyfriend already

01:20:05.449 --> 01:20:06.930
know sign language?

01:20:06.930 --> 01:20:09.415
SHEILA: Oh, he's deaf himself,
so he knows sign language.

01:20:09.415 --> 01:20:10.180
But he's like me.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:12.200
He could speak and sign.

01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.705
But difference is
he had cochlear--

01:20:13.705 --> 01:20:16.387
no wait-- he had hearing
aid, I have cochlear implant.

01:20:20.379 --> 01:20:25.369
AUDIENCE: Do you think that
you've become a faster reader?

01:20:25.369 --> 01:20:27.864
Like do you think you're faster
at reading than most people

01:20:27.864 --> 01:20:29.860
because you rely on it more?

01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.356
SHEILA: I would be more what?

01:20:31.356 --> 01:20:31.856
Faster?

01:20:31.856 --> 01:20:33.022
AUDIENCE: Faster at reading.

01:20:33.022 --> 01:20:34.850
SHEILA: Faster at reading lips?

01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:38.343
AUDIENCE: Like reading words
on a screen or reading text.

01:20:39.370 --> 01:20:40.790
SHEILA: That's a good question.

01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:42.590
I never thought of that.

01:20:42.590 --> 01:20:45.245
It's a possibility because
yeah, you're right.

01:20:45.245 --> 01:20:47.469
Have you seen it in person?

01:20:47.469 --> 01:20:48.635
AUDIENCE: I haven't seen it.

01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:49.801
SHEILA: You haven't seen it.

01:20:49.801 --> 01:20:51.610
So it's like on
that comp screen,

01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:53.660
where she type out
words really fast.

01:20:53.660 --> 01:20:55.520
So I have to read fast.

01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:58.170
But after one hour, I
got too tired to read,

01:20:58.170 --> 01:21:00.370
so I just look around the room.

01:21:03.250 --> 01:21:06.130
The good thing is after class,
she send me a transcript,

01:21:06.130 --> 01:21:07.755
so I will go back
and look at it again.

01:21:08.970 --> 01:21:11.805
So I mean, it's really tiring
to look at computer screen,

01:21:11.805 --> 01:21:14.593
for one hour straight,
reading words really quickly.

01:21:20.887 --> 01:21:21.470
PROFESSOR: OK.

01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:23.500
So the cochlear
implant is sometimes

01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:27.350
called the most successful
neural prosthesis,

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:28.980
and here we have an example.

01:21:31.230 --> 01:21:33.718
So let's give Sheila a hand.

01:21:33.718 --> 01:21:35.710
Thank you very much for coming.

01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:40.445
And we'll talk next time
about brain stem reflexes.

01:21:40.445 --> 01:21:44.540
So we'll hang around if you
have any other questions.

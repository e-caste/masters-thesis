00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.450
This is an F/A-18 Hornet fighter jet. Look
here. There are forward extensions of the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.020
wing called leading edge strakes or leading
edge extensions. Why were the wings designed

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:19.250
this way? In this video, you'll find out.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.810
This video is part of the Representations
video series. Information can be represented

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.859
in words, through mathematical symbols, graphically,
or in 3-D models. Representations are used

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.420
to develop a deeper and more flexible understanding
of objects, systems, and processes.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.210
Hi, I'm Dave Darmofal, and I'm a Professor
in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.690
at MIT. In this video, we're going to see
an example that helps you to visualize the

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.539
air velocity around an airplane body using
smoke flow visualization. You will see that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.829
at low angles of attack, the velocity field
is independent of time, while at high angles

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.030
of attack the velocity field depends on space
and time.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.780
After watching this video: * You will know
that flow quantities around bodies are often

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.130
analyzed using an Eulerian frame. * You will
recognize that flow velocity is a vector field

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:18.500
which depending on the application can be
not only a function of space but also time.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.670
This is Dick, he's the Senior Technical Instructor
here in the department of Aeronautics and

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.880
Astronautics. He is in charge of the Wright
Brothers wind tunnel.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.649
* Wind tunnels are used to simulate the airflow
around a variety of objects including buildings,

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.239
cars, trains, and of course aircraft.

00:01:36.239 --> 00:01:40.408
* The Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel is an example
of a closed-circuit wind tunnel, which uses

00:01:40.408 --> 00:01:45.610
a fan to circulate the air. The test section
of the Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel has an

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:52.009
oval cross-section that is 7 feet high by
10 feet wide. The top velocities we typically

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:57.780
use are around 100mph. While somewhat higher
speeds are possible, the noise is increased

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.780
rapidly with increased fan speed.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.450
* We will visualize the air velocity vector
field using smoke visualization. We seed smoke

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.950
in the tunnel through a handheld probe. The
smoke follows the local air velocity allowing

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.120
us to "see" where the flow is going. This
smoke flow visualization techniques works

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.120
best at lower wind speeds, so we will be testing
at about 25 mph. In other words, the speed

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.719
in the tunnel test section upstream of the
model will be approximately 25 mph.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:37.269
* The model we will be using is based on an
F-16 aircraft. Several years ago, Lockheed

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.230
Martin was investigating increasing the size
of the F-16 wing. A key issue with the increased

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:48.230
wing size, especially at the higher speeds
the F-16 flies at, is the potential for aeroelastic

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.540
instability due to coupling between the aerodynamic
forces and the wing structure. In other words,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.760
because the wing is not a completely rigid
structure, aerodynamic forces can cause the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.090
wing to vibrate, which can cause big problems
during flight. To study this issue, Lockheed

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.120
developed the following simplified geometry.
In the department of Aeronautics and Astronautics

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.959
at MIT, we have also used this model for various
labs and projects in our undergraduate subjects.

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.450
* The model has three main parts to it:

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.510
** The fuselage, which is a body of revolution
with a pointed tip and a bluff end

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.620
** The trapezoidal wing

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.780
** Leading edge strakes, sometimes also called
leading edge extensions

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.030
* The leading edge strakes help stabilize
the flow at high angles of attack by creating

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.849
a strong vortex over the wing. This vortex
is a region swirling velocity and low pressure

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.849
and generates a significant amount of lift.
Thus, strakes can provide significant performance

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.530
benefits for aircraft that require high angle
of attack maneuverability. We will look at

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.260
the vortices created by these strakes today.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:47.530
In many aerodynamic applications, engineers
analyze flows using an Eulerian frame in which

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:54.530
flow quantities such as velocity, pressure,
temperature, etc are viewed as fields: i.e.

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.930
functions of space and often the space of
interest is fixed to the objects frame of

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.019
reference. In our case, this frame of reference
is also the wind tunnels frame of reference.

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:10.700
When you watch a river flowing downstream,
an Eulerian view of the water flow is to watch

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.360
the flow through a fixed point of space, as
the water flows past you. For this demonstration,

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:22.490
we will be visualizing the velocity which
is not just a field, but in particular a vector

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:28.620
field. Further, depending on the flow conditions,
the velocity can be a function of time in

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.440
addition to space. So, we'll think of an air
velocity vector field, v = v(x,t).

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.850
* We will start by visualizing the flow at
a low angle of attack that would be typical

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.380
of a cruise condition, specifically we are
at X degrees angle of attack. In particular,

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.700
the flow at this low angle of attack is, to
good approximation, "steady". This means that

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.720
the flow quantities do not depend on time,
though they do depend on space. In other words,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.570
the velocity field in this case is

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:07.570
* I'll begin by putting the smoke probe relatively
high above the model. You can see the smoke

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:15.500
travels in essentially a straight line downstream.
Note that the line does not change in time

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.760
indicating the flow is steady.

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:23.960
* Now, I'll move the probe slowly down toward
the model. As I do, note that the smoke flow

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.190
starts to show curvature, roughly pointing
upwards in front of the model and then pointing

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.960
downwards behind the model. This clearly shows
that the direction of the velocity field changes

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:41.960
depending on where we look. Further, note
that the smoke lines are again steady. That

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.930
is, when I hold the probe tip at a fixed location,
the shape of the smoke line doesn't change

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:53.370
in time. Thus, we see that the air velocity
for this condition is a "steady" or time-independent

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.700
vector field, i.e. v = v(x).

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.770
* Finally, let's take a look at the flow that
travels near the leading edge strakes to see

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:10.770
if there is any evidence of a vortex. [Ad

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:21.440
UNSTEADY FLOW VISUALIZATION: TIME-DEPENDENT
VECTOR FIELDS

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:30.550
* Now, let's increase the angle of attack
to Y degrees. At this angle of attack, we

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.680
will see that the smoke lines in some regions
will no longer be fixed in time, even though

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.350
the probe location is fixed. This indicates
that the velocity vector field is time-dependent,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.090
i.e.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:51.090
* We'll start by placing the probe again relatively
high above the model. We again see straight

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.290
and steady smoke line.

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.400
* As we again move the probe slowly toward
the body, we again see the curvature of the

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:04.330
smoke lines. Relative to the low angle of
attack case, note that the curvature has increased.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.300
The smoke is still steady as we approach the
body, however, ...

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.080
* When we start to get much closer to the
body, we start to see that the smoke lines

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:20.080
change in time. In fact, they change so rapidly
that the smoke tends to "mix out". Clearly,

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.000
v = v(x,t)

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:29.000
* Let's look at the flow by the leading edge
strake. Now we can see the vortex, which is

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:38.020
characterized by the swirling or corkscrew-like
behavior of the smoke line. Also note that

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:51.120
the smoke line is changing shape with time,
again indicating that v = v(x,t)

00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:59.190
Flow visualization is used to help engineers
understand what is happening in a flow. Usually,

00:07:59.190 --> 00:08:03.710
flow visualization is combined with other
measurements such as force and moment measurements

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:09.000
on the body to arrive at a more complete picture.
In the high angle of attack condition we just

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:16.000
explored, a key question is when the strake
vortex becomes unsteady, where is the unsteadiness?

00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:23.670
For example, is it over the fuselage, over
the wing, etc? This is important because the

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:29.280
unsteady velocity is usually tied to unsteady
pressures acting on the aircraft, which can

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:35.909
then drive the aeroelastic instability and
lead to decreased life of parts of the aircraft.

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:40.520
An example of this actually happened to the
F-18 in which the tail of the aircraft was

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:46.150
subject to unsteady forces caused by fluctuations
in the strake vortex.

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:51.300
This caused the first F-18's to be limited
to only a few hundred flight hours as opposed

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:57.030
to the thousands of flight hours the Navy
desired. A flow visualization of the F-18

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:02.080
strake vortex is shown here.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:05.640
Here's a quick summary of what we saw in this
demonstration:

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:10.660
* Flow quantities around bodies are often
analyzed using an Euler frame.

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.930
* The flow velocity is a vector field which
depending on the application can be not only

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:19.200
a function of space but also time.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.410
* For the aircraft model, we saw that at low
angles of attack, the velocity vector field

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:30.990
was steady (though did depend on space). At
high angles of attack, the velocity field

00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:37.990
was unsteady, i.e. depending on space AND
time.

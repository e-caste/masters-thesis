ANDREW LO: What I
want to do today

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.910
is to continue where we left
off last time in talking

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.400
about the capital
asset pricing model,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.050
and we're going
to finish that off

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.770
in the next 15 or 20 minutes.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.120
And then, I'm going to turn
to applications of the capital

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.170
asset pricing model.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.350
In particular, I want to
focus on capital budgeting.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.380
That's going to be the
last major topic we take on

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.740
for this course.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.589
So let me finish the
capital asset pricing model

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:54.380
and then I'll talk a
little bit about where

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.670
we're going to go for the
remainder of the lectures.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.820
You remember last time
where we left off was,

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.600
I decided to estimate the
CAPM relationship for a couple

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.660
of stocks, Biogen and Motorola.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:14.720
And we found that the estimated
alphas, the deviations

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.790
from the CAPM,
were pretty sizable

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.780
for both of these companies.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.990
And the interpretation
is either,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.460
wow these companies are
really exceptional values,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.920
they offer investors
much, much larger

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.360
expected return than justified
by the appropriate market

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.260
betas.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.050
That's one interpretation,
or the other interpretation

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.380
is there something
missing with the CAPM.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.650
The CAPM doesn't
quite capture all

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:45.830
of the risks that are giving
you these kinds of expected

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.130
rates of return.

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.970
So I'm going to come
back to that debate

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.480
in just a few minutes.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.040
But I thought, that to continue
along these lines, let's

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.120
explore a little bit
about the goodness of fit

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.080
of these measures.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.230
Now, I mentioned last
time that the R-squareds,

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.990
as a measure of goodness of
fit, was 17.5 percent for Biogen

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.950
and 33% for Motorola.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.980
Both of which are
reasonably representative

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.740
of the kind of goodness
of fit measures

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.050
that you're going to
see with financial data,

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.470
for the simple reason that
financial data is very noisy.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.990
And so you're not going to
get any single theory that

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:31.640
can explain 99.9 percent
of the fluctuations

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.440
in any kind of financial series.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.120
So here's a plot of
Biogen versus the market.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.000
Now the market, as I
reminded you last time,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.580
is the valuated
return, including

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.390
dividends, of all stocks on
the NYSE, Amex, and NASDAQ.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.480
So this market
portfolio, you can

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.430
think of as being a broader
version than the S&P 500,

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.510
but it's meant to
capture the market.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.370
So this is a plot of
Biogen versus the market.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.690
And you can see that
there is some slope that

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.930
fits this scatter of points,
and of course the equation

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.750
is 1.42 times the market,
minus a particular value

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.440
for the alpha, and then
R-squared of about 33%

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.350
over this particular
sample period.

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.380
So there is a line that
goes through these points,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.280
but it's not a perfect
straight line by any means.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.620
You can see there's a scatter.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.460
And so there's a
tendency for Biogen

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.470
to move together
with the market,

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.610
but it's not a perfect linear
relationship by any means.

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.700
That's why the
R-squared is not 100%.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.480
It's because we're not able to
explain all of the fluctuations

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.220
with a simple
linear relationship.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.420
Life is more
complicated than that,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.800
and so the CAPM is really
just an approximation

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.000
to a much more complex reality.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.780
Now, a particular stock has
a lot of idiosyncratic risk.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.350
That's what we talked about
last time as the dancing

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.070
the Irish jig on that
catwalk when you're window

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.020
washing on these skyscrapers.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.590
So you can see that that
idiosyncratic risk is really

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.370
quite significant.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.680
What happens if we plot, not
Biogen against the market,

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.550
but another market portfolio
against the market.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:27.010
like let's say NASDAQ.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.180
Well, the next plot shows you.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.430
Look at NASDAQ versus
the market as a whole.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.410
Now NASDAQ, as you know, tends
to have smaller stocks, stocks

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.970
that seem to be technology
oriented, and as a result

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.380
NASDAQ might be more volatile.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.480
But nevertheless, there is a
very strong common relationship

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.630
between these two
market indexes.

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.360
And so now, look at this.

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.160
Scatter of points
is a lot tighter.

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.510
Right?

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.816
Still, it's not exactly linear,
but comparing this to that,

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:02.940
you can see the difference.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.439
Right?

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:05.550
There was a stronger
relationship here.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.520
And not surprisingly,
when you put securities

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.559
into a portfolio, what
gets averaged out?

00:05:13.559 --> 00:05:14.350
AUDIENCE: Outliers.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.590
ANDREW LO: Exactly, the
outliers, and what else?

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:18.830
What other component?

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.330
Leland.

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:20.500
AUDIENCE: The
idiosyncratic risk.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.291
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:05:21.291 --> 00:05:25.090
The Idiosyncratic
risk, The unusual stock

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.974
specific kinds of randomness
that gets averaged out.

00:05:28.974 --> 00:05:30.640
So not surprisingly,
when you put things

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.830
into portfolios the noise, or
the idiosyncratic risks average

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:43.020
out and what you're left with is
whatever common factors remain.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.090
So I'm going to show you
some evidence for how well,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.970
or how poorly the
CAPM works by looking

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.590
not at individual
stocks, because we

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.715
know there's a lot of noise
with individual stocks.

00:05:52.715 --> 00:05:55.060
I want to show you what
happens when you put stocks

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.680
into portfolios and you look
at how those portfolios do.

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.280
So let's do one simple
example, market cap portfolios.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.940
Let's take a look at small
stocks and big stocks.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:10.340
Remember at the introduction
of this series of lectures,

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.400
I showed you some
empirical evidence

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.330
that illustrated the fact
that small stocks seem

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.940
to do really well relative to
large stocks, the size anomaly.

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.610
So let's now take
the size anomaly

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.530
and look at it through
the lens of the CAPM

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:28.540
and ask the question,
with the CAPM

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.071
can we explain the difference
between small and large?

00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:33.570
OK.

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.640
Well, let's take a look.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:41.220
Over the 40 years
from 1960 to 2000,

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.990
approximately, we see that
the small stock portfolio,

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.280
the smallest decile, the
smallest tenth of stocks,

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.030
in terms of market cap, as
a group, as a portfolio,

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:59.790
had an average monthly return
of 1.33% and a beta of 1.4.

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:02.400
On the other hand, the
large stock portfolio

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:08.890
had an average monthly return
of 0.9% and a beta of 0.94.

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:11.530
So that seems like it's
sort of consistent.

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:15.520
Lower risk, lower expected
return, but let's plug it in

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:19.990
and see if the CAPM relationship
actually can tell us something.

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:25.630
So the expected return of the
stock, according to the CAPM,

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:28.510
is going to be given by the
risk free rate, plus beta,

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.607
multiplied by the market risk
premium over the sample period

00:07:31.607 --> 00:07:32.440
that I'm looking at.

00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.939
The market risk premium is about
a half a percent per month.

00:07:34.939 --> 00:07:38.500
So roughly 6% a year.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:42.640
And the risk free rate is
also about a half a percent

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.970
per month during
this time period.

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.960
So now, let's ask
the question, what

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.140
is the expected return of
a large stock portfolio?

00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.390
Well according to
this, it should

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:59.760
be 93 basis points per month.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.380
What about the small
stock portfolio?

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:06.880
According to this, it
should be 1.16% per month.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.140
Now, this is an
amazingly good fit,

00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:15.090
so I wouldn't take this
as typical in the finance

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:15.990
literature.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:19.230
But it just so happens that
over this 40 year period,

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:21.870
the CAPM actually
works pretty darn well.

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:27.540
0.99 is the average
realize return and 0.93 is

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.070
what was predicted.

00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:34.080
For the small cap portfolio,
1.33 is what was realized

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:37.320
and 1.16 was what was predicted.

00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.809
So that's pretty good.

00:08:38.809 --> 00:08:41.240
Now, I want to
emphasize the point

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.669
that this is really
good because, let's take

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:47.630
a look at other ways of
dividing up the universe

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.390
and seeing whether or not we
can get a better explanation

00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:53.280
of risk and expected return.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:57.410
Here's a picture of size sorted
portfolios along the security

00:08:57.410 --> 00:08:57.960
market line.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.660
So remember,
security market line

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.110
is a graph of beta
and expected return.

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:03.890
Right?

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:07.010
The security market line
applies to all portfolios

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.140
and securities, unlike
the capital market

00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:12.500
line that applies only
to efficient portfolios

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.640
and securities.

00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:16.500
So in this case, we expect
a linear relationship.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:20.300
And with the exception of
this little outlier up here.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.510
From 1960 to 2001
there was actually

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:28.580
a pretty reasonable relationship
between beta and expected

00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.120
return.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:33.140
In other words, the CAPM looks
like it's actually doing OK

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.030
for size sorted portfolios.

00:09:35.030 --> 00:09:38.300
The higher the beta, the
higher the expected return.

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:41.270
The lower the beta, the
lower the expected return

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.550
for size sorted portfolios.

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.770
Now, what about for
beta sorted portfolios?

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:47.390
Suppose you took a
bunch of portfolio

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.240
and grouped them into beta's
and asked the question,

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.440
do the high beta portfolios
have higher expected return?

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.740
Low betas have low
expected return?

00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:58.880
It turns out that, again you
get a reasonable relationship.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.420
Not exactly what ' would
expect according to the CAPM.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.220
So the slope of
this line, remember,

00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:08.060
is going to be given by the
risk premium, the market risk

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:09.350
premium.

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:13.040
In fact, the realized
relationship looks linear,

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.080
but it's at a slightly
different slope.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.189
It doesn't look like the risk
premium is the right slope,

00:10:18.189 --> 00:10:19.730
something a little
bit less than that

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.390
seems to be the right slope.

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:24.680
And it turns out that
in 15.433, you're

00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.020
going to learn a new
theory of the CAPM

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.980
that was developed by Fisher
Black called the Balck CAPM.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.750
And the Black CAPM says that
there is no risk-free rate.

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.790
In fact, what you
ought to be using

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.490
is the rate of return of
something called a zero beta

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:41.390
portfolio.

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:43.970
Well it turns out that if you
do that, you would actually

00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:47.630
get a line that fits
this line almost exactly.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:50.300
So the Black
Zero-Beta CAPM seems

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:53.900
to be a better approximation,
but for now the CAPM

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.660
is actually a pretty
reasonable first approximation,

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.980
so let's finish off that first
and I'll come back to the Black

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.010
Zero-Beta CAPM in a minute.

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.600
OK.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.390
So this is a plot of
the expected return

00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:07.460
of beta sorted portfolios.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.190
Higher beta, higher
average return.

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.050
Lower beta, lower
average return.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.960
So it seems like a CAPM is
actually pretty reasonable.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.050
I'm not perfect, but
it gets at the heart

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:23.851
of what risk really means.

00:11:23.851 --> 00:11:25.350
Now in order to
emphasize the point,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.570
let me show you a
couple of other graphs.

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:30.930
This is volatility
sorted portfolios.

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:35.160
So now, I'm sorting stocks based
upon their total volatility,

00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.630
not just their beta.

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:41.220
Remember, the beta measures a
part of their total volatility.

00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:42.150
Right?

00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:45.510
The beta is the systematic
component of the risk.

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:50.590
Volatility is the entire
amount of risk of a security.

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:54.640
If you use volatility as
a way of sorting stocks,

00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.160
then look at the
expected rate of return.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.820
There is no systematic
relationship

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:04.120
between volatility and return.

00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.900
The higher the volatility,
you don't get necessarily the

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:10.890
higher the return.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:15.800
So in other words, volatility
is not the right measure

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.900
of the risk reward trade-off.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.660
One of the first things I talked
to you about in this course

00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.180
is that, if we've learned
anything in modern finance

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.010
we've learned that you don't
get something for nothing,

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.000
and in particular, if you
are gonna bear more risk,

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.180
you have to be paid
to bear more risk,

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:34.430
but you have to define
risk appropriately.

00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:38.510
In this case this diagram
shows that volatility is not

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.710
the right measure of risk.

00:12:39.710 --> 00:12:43.640
You might have to bear more
volatility for whatever reason,

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.990
but you won't
always get rewarded.

00:12:45.990 --> 00:12:46.490
Right?

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.760
Because volatility is
not the relevant measure

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.920
of risk from the capital
markets point of view.

00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.640
What you get rewarded for is
the risk that you cannot get rid

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.500
of by diversification and that
kind of risk is not sigma,

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:01.755
it's beta.

00:13:01.755 --> 00:13:05.620
So beta, you do get rewarded.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:09.130
Sigma, you do not get
rewarded necessarily.

00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.150
Right?

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.360
Higher risk does not
mean necessarily higher

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.150
expected rates of return
when you measure risk

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:17.620
with volatility.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.710
Higher risk in the
form of beta does

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.770
seem to be associated
with higher

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:25.680
expected rates of return.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:26.610
OK.

00:13:26.610 --> 00:13:29.260
Now, in the most
recent literature

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.153
there have been-- oh, question?

00:13:31.153 --> 00:13:33.880
AUDIENCE: So if I remember the
definition of volatiility--

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.375
or based [INAUDIBLE],,
it's a ratio of two

00:13:36.375 --> 00:13:37.600
standard deviations, right?

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.050
ANDREW LO: Beta is the ratio of
a covariance to the variance.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:43.900
It's not the ratio of
standard deviations.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:46.780
In the case of an
efficient portfolio,

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.715
it's the ratio of two
standard deviations.

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.150
Other questions?

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:55.890
OK.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.050
So what I'm going
to tell you now

00:13:58.050 --> 00:14:00.600
is about the most
current research.

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.730
The most current
research suggests

00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:08.160
that, while beta does seem to
have some impact on explaining

00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:12.120
expected returns, there
are other factors out there

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.820
that seem to contribute
to that explanation.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.920
In other words, the
CAPM, while it's

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:22.300
a very interesting and
compelling first approximation,

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.880
it is only an approximation.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:28.480
There are other factors,
like book to market,

00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.660
like liquidity,
like trading volume,

00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:35.980
that seems to also add
to the explanatory power

00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:37.990
of these kinds of relationships.

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.020
So what we're at
today is that we

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.050
think there are multiple
betas out there, not just

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.770
one market beta.

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:49.480
So the basic vanilla
flavored theory of finance,

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.760
and what you're going to
be learning how to use over

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.490
the next few lectures
remaining in this course,

00:14:54.490 --> 00:14:58.420
is the single beta CAPM.

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.660
But where we are at the
cutting edge of research,

00:15:00.660 --> 00:15:03.460
or some would argue the
bleeding edge of research,

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:07.240
is that there are multiple betas
out there, multiple sources

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:09.830
of common risk.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:11.290
So it's not just
the market risk,

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:15.550
that is by far the biggest,
but there is liquidity risk,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:19.400
there is currency risk,
there is term structure risk,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:23.560
there is a variety of risks that
cannot be diversified away with

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.090
a large portfolio of very,
very different kinds of assets.

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.720
And So a better version
of the CAPM, one

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:35.800
that you might use if you are
becoming an expert in finance

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.760
theory, is to try to identify
other sources of betas,

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.360
other sources of expected
return that have risks attached

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.390
to them and to use
these multiple factors

00:15:46.390 --> 00:15:49.050
in your analysis.

00:15:49.050 --> 00:15:52.660
So these are some references
that you can take a look at,

00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:57.510
but the fact is that the CAPM
is used, almost universally,

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:03.900
among portfolio managers, among
venture capitalist, and project

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.670
managers, and chief
financial officers.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.230
So the CAPM is a very,
very powerful framework

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.260
for thinking about
risk and return.

00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:16.230
And so it's important to
understand it, but just

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.800
keep in mind that like
any other finance theory

00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:23.010
it's just a theory, its just
meant to be an approximation

00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:25.399
to a much more complex reality.

00:16:25.399 --> 00:16:26.690
So what we're going to do now--

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:29.385
Yeah, question.

00:16:29.385 --> 00:16:31.176
AUDIENCE: Would the
other betas always have

00:16:31.176 --> 00:16:33.636
to be associated with
like some kind of market

00:16:33.636 --> 00:16:35.604
portfolio or some
representative portfolio,

00:16:35.604 --> 00:16:38.556
or do they just track
a defaulted [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:38.556 --> 00:16:40.040
or something like that.

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:42.456
ANDREW LO: So that's a great
question, let me repeat that.

00:16:42.456 --> 00:16:46.820
The question is, does factors
that are useful for the CAPM

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.160
always have to be
associated with some kind

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.490
of a tradable market
portfolio, or index,

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:55.580
or can it be some other
factor, like macroeconomic like

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:56.900
unemployment?

00:16:56.900 --> 00:17:00.950
Well, there's a big
difference between factors

00:17:00.950 --> 00:17:03.770
that are economically
relevant and factors

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:05.540
that are financially
relevant, and let

00:17:05.540 --> 00:17:07.069
me explain the difference.

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.869
Factors that are
economically relevant

00:17:08.869 --> 00:17:12.950
may well explain the returns
of certain securities.

00:17:12.950 --> 00:17:15.319
A good case in point
is unemployment.

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:17.270
Unemployment is a
factor that does

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:21.470
seem to have some explanatory
power for stock market returns.

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:24.260
The reason that we don't focus
on those kinds of factors

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:26.690
from a financial decision
making point of view

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:30.890
is that while they may
identify interesting economic

00:17:30.890 --> 00:17:34.250
relationships between
certain parts of one

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:37.070
part of the economy and
other, it doesn't really

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:39.870
allow you to make any
kind of market decisions.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.510
In other words, if
you can't trade it,

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:44.190
then you can't manage it.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.880
So from the perspective
of financial applications,

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.580
most of the factor
models that you will see

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:52.130
are factor models
where the risk factors

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:57.140
are portfolios of securities,
or in some other sense tradable

00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.640
So for example, if I had a
particular beta exposure--

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.550
For example, if I'm holding
a portfolio over here

00:18:04.550 --> 00:18:06.830
and this is more
beta than I want,

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.070
I can get rid of that beta
by trading in S&P futures

00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:13.940
contracts to decrease the beta.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.220
You can't trade unemployment.

00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.240
All right?

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.930
At least not as easily as
you could market beta's.

00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:23.840
So while there are many
research papers out there that

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.210
try to document the
relationship between all sorts

00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:29.090
of economic indicators
and financial markets

00:18:29.090 --> 00:18:31.700
from the applications
perspective the kind of models

00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.080
that we will be
dealing with will

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:35.810
be factors that are
associated with portfolios

00:18:35.810 --> 00:18:38.210
of marketable securities
that you can trade,

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:42.015
purely from a
practical perspective.

00:18:42.015 --> 00:18:43.380
OK.

00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.470
So the key points for
these series of lectures,

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:50.670
lectures 15 through 17, what
I want you to take with you

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:53.460
is that there are two
critical relationships

00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:55.050
that you must understand.

00:18:55.050 --> 00:18:59.070
The first, is the risk reward
trade for efficient portfolios,

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:01.320
that's the capital market line.

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.560
And the second, is the
risk reward relationship

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.460
for all other kinds of
portfolios, that's the security

00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:10.920
market line of the CAPM.

00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:12.360
The CAPM.

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.660
requires equilibrium.

00:19:15.660 --> 00:19:18.030
That's a departure
from everything

00:19:18.030 --> 00:19:20.720
we've done in this
course up until now.

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.790
All of the pricing
relationships that I've argued

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:29.370
have to hold things like
present values of bonds,

00:19:29.370 --> 00:19:35.070
of stocks, of futures,
of forwards, of options,

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.040
all of those pricing
models, all of them,

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.910
rely just on this
notion of no free lunch,

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.270
that people prefer more
money to less money.

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.700
But with the CAPM,
I actually had

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.670
to invoke a much
stronger condition.

00:19:50.670 --> 00:19:54.510
I actually had to require
that supply equals demand.

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.220
It was through supply
equaling demand

00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:59.760
that I was able to identify
that the tangency portfolio is

00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.830
equal to the market portfolio.

00:20:01.830 --> 00:20:02.910
OK?

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:08.040
So what we've done is to look
into the heart of the market

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.760
and try to infer from that
what the market is actually

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:16.050
doing by coming up with a
particular discount rate that

00:20:16.050 --> 00:20:19.620
is consistent with
those market views.

00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.790
And that now provides us with
a complete theory of finance

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:25.800
from your perspectives.

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:31.140
You now know how to value 99.9%
of anything that's out there,

00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.100
you've got the tools to do that.

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.014
So what I want to do with
the remainder of the course

00:20:36.014 --> 00:20:37.430
is I'm going to
force you to apply

00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:40.490
those tools In several
different contexts

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:44.540
until you understand
how the tools work.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.230
OK?

00:20:45.230 --> 00:20:50.050
So that's a we're going to do
for the rest of the course.

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:53.170
Let me just pull
up the syllabus.

00:20:53.170 --> 00:20:58.750
Amazingly, we're actually on
schedule despite the crisis

00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.570
and all our discussions thereof.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:06.730
We are to be focusing on capital
budgeting today, next lecture,

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:09.340
and the third
lecture, where we take

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.160
the tools of net present
value calculations and risk

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.876
adjustments and
then just apply them

00:21:13.876 --> 00:21:15.250
to a bunch of
different contexts.

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:18.080
We're going apply
them left and right.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.240
And what I'd like to do after
that is to put it all together.

00:21:22.240 --> 00:21:24.640
In the very last
lecture I'm going

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:28.000
to try to give you a
sense of where we stand

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.780
today in terms of how to apply
these tools more broadly given

00:21:31.780 --> 00:21:34.600
the market conditions
that prevail.

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.150
So I'm going to talk
about market efficiency

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:39.370
versus behavioral
finance, psychology

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:41.470
and I'm going to
bring in some evidence

00:21:41.470 --> 00:21:43.720
from the cognitive
neurosciences that

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.510
will integrate all of the
different parts of the course.

00:21:47.510 --> 00:21:49.780
So make sure if you're going
to come for one lecture,

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.770
you're going to
come to that one,

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.353
because that's where I'm going
to put it all together for you.

00:21:53.353 --> 00:21:54.490
OK.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.970
So we're going to turn now
to this notion of capital

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.380
budgeting.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.830
I'm going to take the
perspective that we now

00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.230
understand how markets work.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:07.600
We understand how
pricing works, we

00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.340
know how to make
risk adjustments,

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:11.170
and we're going to
take those ideas

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:14.200
and apply them to very
practical settings.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.179
And so in that respect
I'm going to ask

00:22:17.179 --> 00:22:18.220
you to change your focus.

00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.770
Up until now we've
been looking at markets

00:22:20.770 --> 00:22:23.710
from the perspective of
an investor, either Warren

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:29.530
Buffett, or the investor that's
steeped in portfolio theory.

00:22:29.530 --> 00:22:31.780
Now, I want you to
change your perspective

00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:36.070
and say that you are a
corporate financial officer,

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.500
or you're a project
manager and you're

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:40.360
trying to make
financial decisions

00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.310
about various
different alternatives.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:45.160
You're not principally
trying to beat the market,

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.740
or you're not principally
trying to invest you're wealth,

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.656
you're trying to make a
decision about whether

00:22:49.656 --> 00:22:51.850
or not to take on
certain projects.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.760
And the question is, how do
we use the tools that we've

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.540
developed to do that?

00:22:56.540 --> 00:22:59.410
So we're going to start
with the NPV rule, which

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:01.960
is the rule that we've
developed at the very beginning

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.110
of this course.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:06.430
It's very appropriate
that we end the course

00:23:06.430 --> 00:23:08.350
with a discussion on
this rule, but now

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.480
with a much more sophisticated
understanding of how

00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:11.590
to apply it.

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:13.600
I'm going to talk about
cash flow computations

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.600
because it will turn out that
cash flows are what you need

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.830
to discount with NPV, not
accounting earnings which

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:23.710
have all sorts of conventions
that are not necessarily

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:27.190
realistic, or relevant for
economic decision making,

00:23:27.190 --> 00:23:30.730
but rather I want you to focus
on actual dollars and cents

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.700
that you're going to be
getting period by period.

00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.990
I'm going to talk
about discount rates

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:40.000
and applying them over
time, project interactions,

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.840
alternatives to the NPV role,
and how capital budgeting is

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:45.910
currently done.

00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:50.060
There are going to be
three different main points

00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:52.070
to this sequence of lectures.

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:57.360
The first main point is to
use proper risk adjustments

00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.940
in doing NPV calculations.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.980
That's something
that I think by now

00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.980
should be already ingrained
in your way of thinking,

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.570
but I want to make
sure that that's true.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:08.450
The second main point
I want to get across

00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:13.490
is that, there are lots of
different ways of doing capital

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:18.200
budgeting, but in
this case there's

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.840
only one right way to do
it from the perspective

00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.180
of economic analysis.

00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.940
Now, economic analysis may
not be the only consideration.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:29.490
When you make a decision about
whether to take on a project,

00:24:29.490 --> 00:24:31.160
there are economic
considerations,

00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.510
but there are also political,
social, practical, cultural,

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.550
all sorts of other
considerations.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:39.883
I'm not going to say anything
about those because that's

00:24:39.883 --> 00:24:42.470
outside the purview of
this finance course,

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.050
but from the business
and financial decision

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.560
making perspective, NPV is
always the right thing to do

00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.940
and I want to emphasize that
by showing you three wrong ways

00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.440
of doing capital budgeting.

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.770
These are ways that people
still will make use of today.

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:02.060
So things like using
IRR, or using payback,

00:25:02.060 --> 00:25:04.479
or using profitability indexes.

00:25:04.479 --> 00:25:06.020
I'm going to go
through each of those

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.740
and argue why those are not
the correct way of making

00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:11.600
financial decisions,
but because they're

00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:14.870
so prevalent I want you to
at least be aware of them

00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:19.170
and understand how
they relate to NPV.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.140
And the last thing
I want to do is

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.090
to tell you about
the complexities

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.790
of financial decision
making by talking

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:28.620
about time as an element.

00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:31.580
In other words, the
fact that decisions

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.150
are being made over
time makes these kinds

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.919
of interactions among projects
very, very complicated.

00:25:38.919 --> 00:25:40.460
And I'm not going
to be able to solve

00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.170
all of those for
you, that's what

00:25:42.170 --> 00:25:44.780
15.434 of this course
on capital budgeting

00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:47.150
and corporate financing will
do, but I want to give you

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.670
a taste of it so you
are aware that there

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:51.470
is a whole other
world out there where

00:25:51.470 --> 00:25:53.690
you've got to take these
tools and understand

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:55.270
how to apply them.

00:25:55.270 --> 00:25:56.030
OK.

00:25:56.030 --> 00:25:59.020
So let's talk
about the NPV role.

00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.140
We started this course
with a statement

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:08.360
that all assets are nothing more
than a sequence of cash flows.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.940
That's what I call an asset.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.450
Every single asset can
be reduced, essentially,

00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.560
to a sequence of task flows.

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:19.240
So this is a sequence of cash
flows for a particular project,

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.620
or asset.

00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:22.870
And the current
market value is simply

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:26.050
the NPV where now
you've got a discount

00:26:26.050 --> 00:26:29.020
by the appropriate
cost of capital that

00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:32.620
is an appropriate risk
adjusted cost of capital

00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.250
where you are adjusting the
risk relevant to that particular

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.110
cash flow.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:41.800
So you'll notice that I
use r1 for cash flow one,

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:46.210
and I use rT for cash T. What
that means is that you can have

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:49.060
two different discount
rates for two different cash

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.120
flows of the same
project because those two

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:54.190
different cash
flows may actually

00:26:54.190 --> 00:26:57.770
have two different risks.

00:26:57.770 --> 00:27:01.610
So now when you see this
expression, which is exactly

00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:04.070
the same expression I showed
you at the very beginning

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:07.100
of this course, it should
have much more meaning to you

00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.010
because now you understand
what amount of effort

00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:15.140
goes in to coming up with that
appropriate discount rate.

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.930
It turns out that because
of something called value

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:21.980
additivity we can make
decisions about how

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:27.290
to allocate our resources
simply by picking those projects

00:27:27.290 --> 00:27:30.930
with big positive NPVs.

00:27:30.930 --> 00:27:34.290
In other words, you don't
have to worry about project

00:27:34.290 --> 00:27:37.830
interactions unless
there are interactions

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:44.060
that are explicitly
involving your decisions.

00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:47.390
Having a firm and
combining high NPV projects

00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:50.600
is the best way to increase
the value of that firm.

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.330
So you look at each project
on a standalone basis

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:55.160
and if there are
project interactions

00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.560
you then evaluate those
interactions separately,

00:27:57.560 --> 00:27:59.460
and I'll give you
examples of that.

00:27:59.460 --> 00:27:59.960
OK.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.450
So we're all familiar with this.

00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.110
This is just the
standard approach

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.990
to calculating market value.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:09.666
Now, the investment
criteria that I'm

00:28:09.666 --> 00:28:11.290
going to propose for
capital budgeting,

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:14.870
for project selection is this.

00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:16.460
For a single project,
if you've got

00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:18.560
one project you're
trying to decide upon,

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:23.510
take it if and only if
the NPV is positive.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.810
If it's positive take
it, if it's negative

00:28:25.810 --> 00:28:27.340
do not take it, or sell it.

00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.521
Short it, if you can.

00:28:28.521 --> 00:28:29.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:29.020 --> 00:28:29.710
OK?

00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:31.660
It's hard to short
projects it's not

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.400
that hard to short securities.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.300
For many independent
projects, take all of them

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.440
with positive NPV.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.740
If they're independent,
meaning that taking one

00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:45.480
doesn't preclude you
from doing another,

00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.580
or there's no
project interactions,

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.930
take them all as long as
they have positive NPV.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:55.410
If there are project
interactions,

00:28:55.410 --> 00:28:58.510
then you have to take
that into account.

00:28:58.510 --> 00:29:00.780
So one simple example
of a project interaction

00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.530
is you can only
take one of many.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.480
And if that's the case,
then you pick the one

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.530
that's got the highest NPV.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.950
Where you have to use the
proper risk adjustment

00:29:13.950 --> 00:29:16.980
for that particular project.

00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:20.130
So in order to compute
NPV you need three things,

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:23.550
you need cash flows, obviously,
you need the discount rates,

00:29:23.550 --> 00:29:26.310
and you need to consider
strategic options.

00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:29.690
The first and the third I'm
not going to help you with,

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:30.660
that's your business.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:32.160
That's the business of business.

00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.340
You've got to identify
what those cash flows are

00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:38.100
and you've got to identify
what your options are.

00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:42.270
What I could help you with,
in the context of this course,

00:29:42.270 --> 00:29:47.220
is evaluating the market
value of those possibilities.

00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.230
Those strategic options,
you now understand

00:29:49.230 --> 00:29:51.420
how to use option
pricing analysis

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.010
and for discount
rates, you now know

00:29:53.010 --> 00:29:54.750
how to use risk
adjustments to calculate

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:57.210
the appropriate discount rates.

00:29:57.210 --> 00:30:00.150
But the other stuff is
domain specific expertise

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.962
that you bring to the table.

00:30:01.962 --> 00:30:04.170
And so I told you at the
very beginning of the course

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:07.590
that finance is the language of
business, this is what I mean.

00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.350
You can't even talk
about making a decision

00:30:10.350 --> 00:30:12.240
unless you speak the
language of finance,

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:16.080
unless you evaluate projects
in this kind of a framework.

00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:16.860
OK.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.740
So in terms of cash
flow calculations,

00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.110
I'm going to give you some
examples in a few minutes,

00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:24.550
but let me summarize what
I'm going to tell you

00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:27.720
and then we can talk about the
specifics through that example.

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.780
The first point, is you
should use cash flows, not

00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.870
accounting earnings because
again, accounting earnings

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:38.250
are meant for purposes
other than decision making.

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:41.700
Accounting is really meant
as a kind of a checkup

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:43.920
to see how you've done.

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.480
How you've done is
not the same thing

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.490
as how you're going to do.

00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:51.870
One of the things that I
think is apparently not

00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:54.090
emphasized enough
is that when you

00:30:54.090 --> 00:30:57.400
look at accounting
data you're looking

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:00.820
at numbers that are
not random variables,

00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.990
they have been realized.

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:06.400
There's no uncertainty in what
a balance sheet, or an income

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.840
statement says.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.550
It's about the past.

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.737
And accountants
hate uncertainties.

00:31:11.737 --> 00:31:13.820
I don't know how many
people are accountants here,

00:31:13.820 --> 00:31:15.850
or how many accountants you
know, but if you know them

00:31:15.850 --> 00:31:18.058
you know there's a certain
personality type that gets

00:31:18.058 --> 00:31:20.320
drawn into that profession.

00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.690
And these are not
big risk takers,

00:31:23.690 --> 00:31:27.111
they want to see order and
certainty in what they're

00:31:27.111 --> 00:31:27.610
doing.

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:29.193
That's what a good
accountant will do,

00:31:29.193 --> 00:31:32.500
is to try to understand
where to put all the expenses

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:37.170
and revenues into the proper
boxes so that it all adds up.

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:39.330
Accounting is incapable.

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:44.900
It is not designed to manage
and reflect uncertainty.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:47.330
You've heard the term
off-balance sheet item, right?

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:49.640
For example, I've spoken
before about a credit default

00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:51.620
swap, or a futures contract.

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.450
If you engage in a futures
transaction, the moment

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.150
you engage in that
transaction what's

00:31:58.150 --> 00:32:00.640
the NPV of a futures contract?

00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.544
AUDIENCE: Zero.

00:32:01.544 --> 00:32:02.210
ANDREW LO: Zero.

00:32:02.210 --> 00:32:03.560
Exactly.

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.580
And as a result, that does
not go on the balance sheet

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.700
because it is neither an
asset nor is it a liability.

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:13.920
It's both, or neither,
depending on how you look at it.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.490
It's an off-balance sheet
item because it doesn't--

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.140
Where do you put it?

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.590
It has zero value.

00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:23.200
But the point is that entering
into one of those agreements

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.030
has a big impact on
your future risk.

00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:28.930
So accounting, the
language of accounting

00:32:28.930 --> 00:32:32.530
is not ideally suited for
thinking about the future.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.056
It's a wonderful method
for understanding

00:32:35.056 --> 00:32:36.430
what happened in
the past and you

00:32:36.430 --> 00:32:38.980
need to understand that in
order to plan for the future,

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.320
you need to know what
your current assets are

00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:43.150
and what your current
liabilities are,

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:46.070
but that doesn't tell you where
your risks are going to be

00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:47.560
and it doesn't
allow you to speak

00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:50.680
about the dynamics of cash
flows because that's not

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:52.930
what an accountants job is.

00:32:52.930 --> 00:32:54.806
That's not what accounting
is designed to do.

00:32:54.806 --> 00:32:55.305
Right?

00:32:55.305 --> 00:32:57.400
This is not meant to be
a critique of accounting,

00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.670
but simply that you can't use
it for purposes that it wasn't

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.640
ideally designed to serve.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.190
So the first point is,
you've got to use cash flows,

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:07.510
not accounting earnings.

00:33:07.510 --> 00:33:10.290
Second point, you've got to
use after-tax cash flows.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:10.790
Why?

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:12.640
Because you have to pay taxes.

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.440
That's one of the,
along with death

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:18.610
and some other unavoidable
aspects of life,

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:19.900
you have to pay taxes.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.720
So if you have to pay
taxes, then you may as well

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:25.750
look at after-tax cash flows.

00:33:25.750 --> 00:33:27.670
The reason this is
important is because there

00:33:27.670 --> 00:33:32.300
are certain things that show up
as cash flows that you wouldn't

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.550
ordinarily think of as cash
flows because of the tax code.

00:33:35.550 --> 00:33:38.770
For example, depreciation.

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:41.670
Depreciation is an
accounting technique

00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:46.680
for attributing the
decline of capital assets.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:50.640
When you buy a machine it's new
on day one, but after 50 years

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.100
it's not new anymore and
it's not worth the same

00:33:53.100 --> 00:33:55.960
after 15 years as
it is on day one.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.990
Now, how you account for the
loss in value of that machine,

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.150
how you account for how
the machine gets used up

00:34:03.150 --> 00:34:07.950
over 15 years, that's a
matter of accounting practice

00:34:07.950 --> 00:34:11.489
that may have no bearing
on the actual economics

00:34:11.489 --> 00:34:14.730
of the machine, but it
has absolute bearing

00:34:14.730 --> 00:34:17.070
on the cash flows
that you are going

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:20.159
to receive because you
get to deduct depreciation

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.590
expenses off of your taxes.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.480
So after tax cash
flow is as important.

00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:29.670
And finally, this third
point sounds simple,

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:33.420
but it's anything but simple
unless you practice with it

00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.070
and do a lot of examples.

00:34:36.070 --> 00:34:40.199
Use cash flows attributable
to the project.

00:34:40.199 --> 00:34:42.250
In other words,
you've got to compare

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:44.750
the firm with and
without the project

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.570
and look at the cash flows.

00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:47.770
OK?

00:34:47.770 --> 00:34:52.480
It's very, very easy to forget
certain cash flows that either

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.820
come along with the
project, or have

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.630
to be spent if you
take on the project

00:34:58.630 --> 00:35:01.720
and you'll end up missing
one element or another.

00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:05.830
And in many cases those
kinds of omissions

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:08.440
can have a huge impact
on whether or not

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.200
you decide to take
on the project.

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.150
So there are lots of
examples about how

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:17.050
you might do that here, but
in the end practice, practice,

00:35:17.050 --> 00:35:19.780
practice is going to
get you to understand

00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:23.130
how to take into account
each of the features.

00:35:23.130 --> 00:35:25.620
So I want to just go
through a few of these now

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.864
and then I'm going to
talk about the point

00:35:27.864 --> 00:35:29.280
that I started
with earlier, which

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:32.070
is I want to show you some
techniques for capital

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.650
budgeting that are
incorrect and how

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:37.290
they relate to the NPV rule.

00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.990
So let me just tell
you a little bit more

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:44.170
about accounting earnings
versus cash flows.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:48.120
Cash flows are what you need
to use for calculating NPV

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.940
because in the end what matters
is the cash that you get,

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:56.040
not the accounting profits that
may or may not be realizable.

00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:01.710
So cash flows are simply equal
to cash cash inflows minus cash

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:02.760
outflows.

00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:04.590
That sounds simple, right?

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:06.600
It's not simple
because you've got

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:09.630
to figure out what those
cash inflows or outflows are

00:36:09.630 --> 00:36:12.541
from, in many cases,
accounting data.

00:36:12.541 --> 00:36:14.040
And so you need to
know a little bit

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.110
about how the
accounting interacts

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:18.250
with these kinds
of calculations.

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:20.560
So I'll just give you a
little bit more detail,

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:25.020
and I'll leave it up to you to
focus on specific applications

00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:26.640
because the accounting
rules, first

00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:29.730
of all they change fairly
often and actually right now

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.420
at the heart of the debate
in the financial crisis

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:37.680
is this notion of fair value
accounting, FAS 157, which

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.590
says that you've got to use
market values for updating

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.480
your assets and liabilities.

00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.270
And that's a new ruling that
has created some problems

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:48.450
because market values,
during times of stress,

00:36:48.450 --> 00:36:50.310
can drop precipitously.

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:53.160
And this is why I told you
early on that accounting

00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:56.040
is not ideally suited to
deal with a lot of issues

00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:59.640
having to do with risky
assets because risk is not

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.060
an element that the
accounting framework is

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.480
well-suited to deal with.

00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:09.720
So how do we get cash
inflows minus cash outflows.

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.060
Well, operating
revenues is typically

00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:16.890
what cash inflows involve for
a given project, operating

00:37:16.890 --> 00:37:18.030
revenues.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:21.690
And then, you subtract from
that operating expenses

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.150
without depreciation.

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.430
The reason you don't take
into account depreciation

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.140
is, as I told you,
depreciation is

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:32.100
one of these magic
accounting concepts that

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.710
has no bearing on reality.

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.800
It's a mechanism for
simply accounting

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.910
for a decline in the market
value of a particular kind

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:43.980
of equipment, or asset.

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:46.350
And there are a lot of
different accounting conventions

00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:49.110
that are a function
of tax code changes.

00:37:49.110 --> 00:37:52.440
For example, in some
cases you can accelerate

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.760
the depreciation of an asset.

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.584
Even though a machine
is working fine,

00:37:55.584 --> 00:37:57.000
there are certain
situations where

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.190
you can assume that
half of the machine

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:01.770
evaporated after one year.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.160
Now how does that happen?

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:07.080
Well it's an accounting tool
that Congress passed years

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.920
ago to allow companies,
businesses, to accelerate

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:14.351
the depreciation and
therefore get a tax advantage.

00:38:14.351 --> 00:38:14.850
Question?

00:38:14.850 --> 00:38:19.690
AUDIENCE: Aren't income taxes
linked to the accounting

00:38:19.690 --> 00:38:20.658
nuances?

00:38:20.658 --> 00:38:22.836
So if we're using
taxes, I'm saying,

00:38:22.836 --> 00:38:25.014
sort of, we can't use
accounting [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:25.014 --> 00:38:26.466
because it's a depreciation--

00:38:26.466 --> 00:38:27.966
Depending what
depreciation that you

00:38:27.966 --> 00:38:29.505
used, do income taxes change?

00:38:29.505 --> 00:38:30.130
ANDREW LO: Yes.

00:38:30.130 --> 00:38:30.590
That's right.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.464
And so we're going to
take that into account,

00:38:32.464 --> 00:38:35.270
but the point is that for
the purposes of cash flow,

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.510
the depreciation schedule
will impact the cash

00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:42.220
flow only in terms of the actual
tax shields that it generates.

00:38:42.220 --> 00:38:45.580
Not that it will decrease
the value of the machine

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.370
when the accountants
tell you that it will.

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:49.790
OK?

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.430
So the idea is that
your operating expenses

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.490
are expenses you have to
pay irrespective of what

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:58.220
the depreciation schedule is.

00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:02.000
So accounting expenses
without depreciation

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.040
is what you're
paying out in cash.

00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.520
It's the actual cash
outflow every single year.

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.660
Capital expenditures is what
you spend on new equipment,

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.670
and then income taxes.

00:39:14.670 --> 00:39:16.050
So this is your point, Louis.

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:19.770
All of the effect of
depreciation on your income tax

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:21.510
gets included in here.

00:39:21.510 --> 00:39:23.590
Income taxes you have
to pay every year,

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.080
so that's a cash outflow.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:25.830
Right?

00:39:25.830 --> 00:39:28.350
So if there's something that
can reduce your cash outflow,

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:30.486
you better take
that into account.

00:39:30.486 --> 00:39:32.110
And that's where
depreciation comes in.

00:39:32.110 --> 00:39:36.030
It's a tax shield that allows
you not to pay as much taxes,

00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:39.810
so it reduces your tax burden,
it reduces your income taxes.

00:39:39.810 --> 00:39:42.870
But again, the focus
is on cash flows.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:45.450
Money in versus money out.

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:47.730
That's what you're
trying to measure.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:52.540
And once you get the measure
of money in minus money out,

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.720
then you can start
discounting using

00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:56.770
your appropriate
cost of capital,

00:39:56.770 --> 00:39:59.090
but you got to get
the cash flows right.

00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:02.910
And so there are a number
of other subtleties.

00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:06.540
For example, the
project income taxes

00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.960
that you pay for your project
is going to be the corporate tax

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:14.760
rate, times the operating
profit, minus the tax rate,

00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.400
times your depreciation.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:20.880
So your depreciation
doesn't actually

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.140
affect the profitability of the
particular piece of equipment,

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:29.130
or the project, except
in so far as it affects

00:40:29.130 --> 00:40:31.760
the taxes you have to pay.

00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.660
So project income taxes,
that income taxes associated

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:37.910
with your particular
project, are

00:40:37.910 --> 00:40:40.850
going to simply be the tax rate
multiplied by the operating

00:40:40.850 --> 00:40:44.960
profit, minus the tax rate,
times whatever depreciation

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:48.500
you can claim, and so this is
how you can get depreciation

00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.000
into your cash flows.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.250
It affects the amount of
income taxes you're paying

00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:54.670
and that's it.

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:57.650
So the bottom line,
what's your task flow?

00:40:57.650 --> 00:41:01.090
It's going to be one,
minus your tax rate,

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:04.070
times the operating profits.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:07.940
Operating profits is operating
revenues, minus operating

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:11.720
expenses without depreciation.

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:13.850
Without depreciation.

00:41:13.850 --> 00:41:18.260
Depreciation comes in later when
you're talking about the taxes.

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:20.840
So here is where the
depreciation comes in.

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:23.930
So your cash flow is
operating profits,

00:41:23.930 --> 00:41:27.470
multiplied by one,
minus the tax rate,

00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:30.979
minus your capital
expenditures, and by the way,

00:41:30.979 --> 00:41:33.020
your capital expenditures,
notice that you're not

00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.180
getting taxed on that.

00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:37.250
Nor do you get a
deduction for that.

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:40.520
You don't get to deduct
capital expenditures the way

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:44.420
you get to deduct ordinary
expenses from running a company

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:47.060
because capital expenditures
are treated differently

00:41:47.060 --> 00:41:48.890
by the tax code.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.250
Does that make sense?

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:50.930
Who knows.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:53.760
That's for the tax
experts to decide upon.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.986
The fact is that capital
expenditures have

00:41:55.986 --> 00:41:57.360
a different tax
treatment and you

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.776
have to know that, that's why
you need accountants to tell

00:41:59.776 --> 00:42:01.530
you how they get treated.

00:42:01.530 --> 00:42:06.660
The way they get treated is you
get to depreciate the capital

00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:12.000
expenditures as the accountants
tell you you're using them up.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:15.030
So if you buy a piece of
equipment for $25 million,

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:18.570
you don't get to deduct it
right away because you're not

00:42:18.570 --> 00:42:21.050
using all of it right away.

00:42:21.050 --> 00:42:23.780
You're using part
of it every year.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:25.130
How much are you using?

00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:29.340
That's where the depreciation
schedule becomes relevant.

00:42:29.340 --> 00:42:33.350
So here what you're getting,
in terms of cash flows,

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.380
what you're getting
is the depreciation

00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:40.880
that you report every year,
multiplied by the tax rate.

00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:45.000
You're getting that as
a positive cash flow.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:45.954
Why is that?

00:42:45.954 --> 00:42:47.120
Who can tell me why that is?

00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:53.251
Yeah.

00:42:53.251 --> 00:42:56.860
AUDIENCE: Because you're
not paying any expenses.

00:42:56.860 --> 00:43:00.900
ANDREW LO: That's
not quite right.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.830
It's along those lines, but
not exactly, that's not exactly

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:05.640
the mechanism.

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:06.172
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:06.172 --> 00:43:07.630
AUDIENCE: This
position is expense,

00:43:07.630 --> 00:43:09.942
but it's not out of cash flow.

00:43:09.942 --> 00:43:10.650
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:43:10.650 --> 00:43:13.530
Depreciation is an
expense you get to deduct,

00:43:13.530 --> 00:43:15.330
so you're right about
that, but you're

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:18.340
getting to deduct it purely
because of the tax code.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.070
And because you get
to deduct it you

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:22.260
don't have to pay this much tax.

00:43:22.260 --> 00:43:24.780
In other words, without
the depreciation

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.780
you would be out
this much money.

00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.800
But because you
have that deduction,

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.469
it's like a get out
of jail free card,

00:43:30.469 --> 00:43:32.010
you basically take
this card and say,

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.740
here I don't have to pay this
much tax, how much is that card

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:35.610
worth?

00:43:35.610 --> 00:43:37.500
Well, it's worth this.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.330
So this is actually
the amount of cash

00:43:39.330 --> 00:43:41.130
you're going to get
to keep in your pocket

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:44.377
if you have this
depreciation tax shield.

00:43:44.377 --> 00:43:45.960
That's what it's
called, a tax shield.

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.990
It prevents you from paying
a certain amount of taxes.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.790
You actually get to keep
that money in your company.

00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:53.280
So it's actual
cash flows to you.

00:43:55.790 --> 00:44:00.050
So the accounting impact
of depreciation is here.

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:03.440
And it's important, I know it
seems like it's a waste of time

00:44:03.440 --> 00:44:05.870
for us to spend time
for my telling you

00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:09.470
how to do accounting, but this
is an important enough point

00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:12.860
that people forget when you're
doing NPV calculations that I

00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:14.540
want to hammer this home.

00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.390
What matters, from an
economic perspective,

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:19.580
is the cash that you're
getting for your project

00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:21.260
year in and year out.

00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:22.970
Keep your eyes on the cash.

00:44:22.970 --> 00:44:26.600
Don't keep it on the accounting
numbers, keep it on the cash.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:29.800
And if you do that,
you'll never go wrong.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.880
OK.

00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:35.050
Here's an example just
to make the point.

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:39.100
A machine is purchased for a $1
million with a life of 10 years

00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:41.440
and it generates annual
revenues of 300,000

00:44:41.440 --> 00:44:44.092
and operating
expenses of 100,000.

00:44:44.092 --> 00:44:45.550
If you assume that
the machine gets

00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:50.200
depreciated over 10 years using
straight line depreciation.

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.086
What does that
mean, straight line?

00:44:52.086 --> 00:44:52.585
Yeah.

00:44:52.585 --> 00:44:53.920
AUDIENCE: Equal
amounts every year.

00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:54.670
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:44:54.670 --> 00:44:57.220
So if the machine is
worth a million bucks

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:00.290
and you're depreciating it
over 10 years straight line,

00:45:00.290 --> 00:45:01.803
what do you deduct every year?

00:45:01.803 --> 00:45:02.928
AUDIENCE: 1,000 [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:02.928 --> 00:45:03.750
ANDREW LO: 100,000.

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.249
Yeah.

00:45:04.249 --> 00:45:05.140
Yeah, that's right.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:06.990
It'd be 100 years
if you did 10,000.

00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:09.570
That would be a long
life of the machine.

00:45:09.570 --> 00:45:12.500
That's right $10,000--
$100,000 a year

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.010
for 10 years, that's how much
the accountants are telling you

00:45:16.010 --> 00:45:17.990
you're using up the machine.

00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:21.350
And so every year you
get to deduct $100,000

00:45:21.350 --> 00:45:23.820
from that kind of depreciation.

00:45:23.820 --> 00:45:25.630
So what is your
after-tax cash flow?

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:28.250
Now, you're accounting
earnings, the way

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:32.930
that an accountant would accrue
the earnings would be this.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:39.450
It's 3 million, minus
100k, minus a 300k,

00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:44.680
minus 100k, minus 100k,
that's 100k of earnings.

00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:48.570
So an accountant would
tell you that your earnings

00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.600
for this situation
is $100,000 a year.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.140
Right?

00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:56.200
However, that's
not the cash flows.

00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.760
Let's look at the task flows.

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.580
The cash flows on
an after tax basis,

00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:07.780
assuming a 40% corporate
tax rate is 1 minus 0.4,

00:46:07.780 --> 00:46:12.430
times revenue of 300, minus
operating expenses of 100.

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:17.350
So you're making $200 cash
every year before tax,

00:46:17.350 --> 00:46:21.670
but then you've got to
pay tax, but then you're

00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:25.760
getting a depreciation
deduction of $100,000 a year.

00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:31.170
So you're actually getting
$160,000 of cash every year.

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:35.340
Not a 100, but 160.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.230
So when you do an
NPV calculation

00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.500
it makes a world of difference
whether your NPVing this guy,

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.320
or your NPVing this guy.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.800
They're not the same.

00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.460
Right?

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:46.620
And from an economic
decision perspective,

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:49.600
this is what you ought
to focus on, not on this.

00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.924
Yeah, Edward?

00:46:50.924 --> 00:46:51.507
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:46:51.507 --> 00:46:53.423
Probably through the
accounting calculation,

00:46:53.423 --> 00:46:55.339
you will have the
million up front.

00:46:55.339 --> 00:46:58.692
While here you will have a
cash flow and a cash in flow

00:46:58.692 --> 00:47:00.130
from here [INAUDIBLE], right?

00:47:00.130 --> 00:47:00.270
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:01.200
AUDIENCE: In the accounting.

00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:02.200
ANDREW LO: That's right.

00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:03.660
So there are other
considerations

00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.800
that you might want to
bring into the analysis,

00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.929
but my point is simply
using accounting earnings

00:47:07.929 --> 00:47:10.470
versus after tax cash flows will
give you a different number.

00:47:10.470 --> 00:47:13.520
In both cases, I'm not I'm
not taking into account

00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:16.050
the upfront outlay of a million.

00:47:16.050 --> 00:47:16.550
Right?

00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:17.800
AUDIENCE: But in the
accounting you would never.

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:18.040
ANDREW LO: Right.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:18.664
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:47:18.664 --> 00:47:19.290
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:19.290 --> 00:47:20.040
ANDREW LO: Agreed.

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.000
That's right.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.687
And that's part of the problem.

00:47:22.687 --> 00:47:24.270
That's one of the
reasons, by the way,

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:27.210
why certain companies
are incentivized

00:47:27.210 --> 00:47:29.220
to acquire other companies.

00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.930
It's because the
acquisition costs

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:34.086
aren't accounted for in the same
way that the operating costs.

00:47:34.086 --> 00:47:35.460
So if you've got
a company that's

00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:38.430
generating a lot of profits,
it's very profitable,

00:47:38.430 --> 00:47:41.010
but it cost you a lot of money
to acquire, from the counting

00:47:41.010 --> 00:47:42.390
perspective it can
make you look really

00:47:42.390 --> 00:47:44.723
good because your earnings
are going to get a big boost,

00:47:44.723 --> 00:47:47.130
but in fact the NPV
of the situation

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:49.250
may not be as attractive.

00:47:49.250 --> 00:47:51.780
The bottom line from
shareholder wealth,

00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.715
if you are doing this for
your own personal account

00:47:54.715 --> 00:47:56.090
you'd want to be
making decisions

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:59.660
not on accounting earnings
alone, but rather on cash

00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:00.270
flows.

00:48:00.270 --> 00:48:00.530
All right?

00:48:00.530 --> 00:48:01.140
NPVs.

00:48:01.140 --> 00:48:02.950
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:05.560
AUDIENCE: What about if you
can give a working capital?

00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:09.440
Aren't you supposed to take
it also in to consideration?

00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:10.660
ANDREW LO: In what sense?

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:13.110
You're looking at the
net incremental impact

00:48:13.110 --> 00:48:16.440
on your working capital and
this take that into account.

00:48:16.440 --> 00:48:19.410
Wokring capital is the change--

00:48:19.410 --> 00:48:21.885
is demanding opportunity
to invest in the business

00:48:21.885 --> 00:48:23.800
in order to make the
business to grow.

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.050
ANDREW LO: Yeah, that's right.

00:48:25.050 --> 00:48:26.760
So I haven't talked
about what the NPV.

00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:29.710
Is if you want to do the NPV
you've got to ask the question,

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:33.180
does the after tax cash flow
justify a million dollars?

00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:36.420
I haven't talked about that yet.

00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:38.970
So I'm not I'm not
suggesting that we've

00:48:38.970 --> 00:48:40.350
got an answer for
what you should

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.344
do with this
particular situation,

00:48:42.344 --> 00:48:44.010
I'm simply using this
as an illustration

00:48:44.010 --> 00:48:45.930
to point out that
accounting earnings is not

00:48:45.930 --> 00:48:50.277
the same thing as after
tax net cash task flows.

00:48:50.277 --> 00:48:50.776
Yeah.

00:48:50.776 --> 00:48:53.242
AUDIENCE: So from a
finance [INAUDIBLE] point,

00:48:53.242 --> 00:48:57.098
we don't care about this
[INAUDIBLE] company, as well as

00:48:57.098 --> 00:49:00.480
this ability to generate
future cash flows?

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:03.846
ANDREW LO: Well, no I
didn't I did not say that.

00:49:03.846 --> 00:49:05.220
The question about
whether or not

00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.250
you care about the
solvency of the company

00:49:08.250 --> 00:49:11.460
is a question about what the
ultimate costs of bankruptcy

00:49:11.460 --> 00:49:14.970
are, but from a
shareholder's perspective,

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:17.730
if you ask the question what
does the shareholder want

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:21.070
you, the corporate manager,
to do, the answer is simple.

00:49:21.070 --> 00:49:24.060
The shareholder wants you to
maximize the net present value

00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:26.580
of the business.

00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:27.410
OK?

00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:29.780
If there are dramatic
costs of bankruptcy,

00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.730
or financial stress,
then you're going

00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:34.340
to have to incorporate that
into your calculation for what

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:35.060
you should do.

00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:36.320
Absolutely.

00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:37.700
But the point is
that when you're

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.120
looking at net present value,
net present value gives you

00:49:41.120 --> 00:49:43.280
the appropriate data
to make that trade off.

00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:49.150
Always use net present
value to at least calculate

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:51.820
the implications of the
various different investments.

00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.800
In the case of bankruptcy
costs, if there

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:56.156
are dramatic costs of
financial distress,

00:49:56.156 --> 00:49:58.280
then you don't want to go
there because then you're

00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.580
not going to be serving the best
interest of the shareholders.

00:50:01.580 --> 00:50:04.700
But if on the other hand,
there are very little risks

00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:06.650
of financial
distress and there's

00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:08.420
an incredibly good
opportunity for you

00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:12.290
to take on certain risk that
looks more than worthwhile

00:50:12.290 --> 00:50:14.480
relative to the
compensation you're getting,

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:17.660
then I would argue that
it makes sense to do so.

00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:21.130
So the question is
one about magnitude.

00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:24.190
What are the bankruptcy
costs versus the value

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:27.700
of the upside for the
particular project at hand?

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.200
And you've got to
make that decision

00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.059
with all the various different
data properly computed.

00:50:33.059 --> 00:50:35.350
What I'm telling you how to
do is to compute that data.

00:50:39.290 --> 00:50:40.130
All right.

00:50:40.130 --> 00:50:44.540
Here are some other
calculations that describe

00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:46.340
what went on in the previous.

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:49.640
This is a case of accounting
earnings after tax, cash flow

00:50:49.640 --> 00:50:50.990
after tax.

00:50:50.990 --> 00:50:53.510
The bottom line is
that they're different.

00:50:53.510 --> 00:50:57.200
So for the perspective
of NPV calculations

00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.500
you ought to focus on the
particular calculation that

00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:02.420
gives you net cash flows.

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:10.130
So now I'm going to turn to
focusing on the denominator,

00:51:10.130 --> 00:51:12.530
discount rates.

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:15.680
We already went through
an analysis about how

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.640
to pick the discount rate.

00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.030
The discount rate that
you use is the one

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:22.910
that adjusts for the
risk of the project,

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:25.580
but keep in mind that
a project's discount

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.620
rate, the required
rate of return

00:51:27.620 --> 00:51:32.300
is the expected return demanded
by investors for the project.

00:51:32.300 --> 00:51:35.240
The way you ought to think
about it is the project,

00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:40.160
think of it like a stock and
ask the question, for people who

00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:41.840
are going to buy
that project, they're

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:44.960
going to buy the stock,
what kind of a discount rate

00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:49.310
are they going to place on
the riskiness of that stock.

00:51:49.310 --> 00:51:52.250
It's just like Gillette
versus General Motors,

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:54.600
we talked about that last time.

00:51:54.600 --> 00:51:59.600
Depending on how risk
averse the population is,

00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:02.450
that will determine a
particular market risk premium.

00:52:02.450 --> 00:52:04.370
The market risk
premium and the beta

00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:07.310
is going to determine what the
appropriate discount rate is

00:52:07.310 --> 00:52:10.820
for that particular stock,
and the idiosyncratic risk

00:52:10.820 --> 00:52:13.280
is going to be assumed
away because nobody

00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:15.110
has to bear that risk.

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:18.545
Everybody can be diversified
if they want to be.

00:52:18.545 --> 00:52:21.780
The second thing is that the
discount rate, in general,

00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.655
depends on the timing and
the risks of the cash flows.

00:52:24.655 --> 00:52:27.030
I'm going to give you an
example in a few minutes that'll

00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:28.530
throw you off a
bit because there's

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:30.197
going to be two
different kinds of risks

00:52:30.197 --> 00:52:32.613
and you're going to have to
differentiate between the two.

00:52:32.613 --> 00:52:34.050
So let me come
back to that point

00:52:34.050 --> 00:52:37.080
with an example that
will be much clearer.

00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:41.160
And the last couple of points
is that, the discount rate

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.300
is usually different
for different projects.

00:52:43.300 --> 00:52:45.630
Now, this is something
that, again, a lot

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:47.340
of corporate managers miss.

00:52:47.340 --> 00:52:51.330
They feel that if they're in
a particular division then

00:52:51.330 --> 00:52:54.044
that division has a
particular cost of capital

00:52:54.044 --> 00:52:55.710
and from that point
on you should always

00:52:55.710 --> 00:52:57.270
use the cost of
capital for anything

00:52:57.270 --> 00:52:59.460
that the division does.

00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:01.500
What if it's the case
that the division is

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:04.440
doing something so different
from what it originally

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.390
started with?

00:53:06.390 --> 00:53:08.990
And I'm going to give
you an example of that.

00:53:08.990 --> 00:53:12.060
An example is something that
happened just a couple of years

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:12.880
ago.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:14.421
I don't know how
many of you realize,

00:53:14.421 --> 00:53:16.920
but Bloomberg, you know the
maker of those nice terminals

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:20.040
that everybody uses, Bloomberg
has actually a publishing

00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:21.730
company.

00:53:21.730 --> 00:53:22.480
Yeah that's right.

00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:24.730
There's a Bloomberg
Business press.

00:53:24.730 --> 00:53:29.350
They publish books and this
particular business just

00:53:29.350 --> 00:53:32.382
got launched a
couple of years ago.

00:53:32.382 --> 00:53:34.090
They already have a
whole bunch of books.

00:53:34.090 --> 00:53:35.710
In fact, they're
publishing a book

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:38.950
that I've been working on
with a former student of mine

00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:42.660
a series of interviews
of technical analysts.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:48.100
And so as part of this idea of
setting up a business press,

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.700
they had to figure out what
the appropriate cost of capital

00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:55.390
is for that activity, and then
ask for money from the parent

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:58.360
company to launch this.

00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:00.970
So the question is,
how do they do that?

00:54:00.970 --> 00:54:04.660
Do they use the appropriate
cost of capital for Bloomberg?

00:54:04.660 --> 00:54:07.540
Bloomberg's business
is not publishing.

00:54:07.540 --> 00:54:08.320
All right?

00:54:08.320 --> 00:54:11.765
They're an information
vendor, and they're

00:54:11.765 --> 00:54:13.280
a technology company.

00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:16.460
And as such, they have a
certain multiple, right?

00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.130
Those of you who are in venture
capital, project financing,

00:54:19.130 --> 00:54:20.750
you know about multiples, right?

00:54:20.750 --> 00:54:23.690
If you have a company with a
particular kind of earnings,

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:26.750
then the value of the
company is typically

00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:31.380
stated as a multiple
of those earnings.

00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:35.520
The multiple for an IT
company, a technology company,

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.240
a financial services
company, a multiple

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:40.010
there is not the
same as the multiple

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:42.240
for a publishing company.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.000
By the way, which
multiple is higher?

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.790
Does anybody know?

00:54:47.790 --> 00:54:49.665
AUDIENCE: IT?

00:54:49.665 --> 00:54:50.290
ANDREW LO: Yes?

00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:52.275
AUDIENCE: Actually,
publishing is higher.

00:54:52.275 --> 00:54:54.150
ANDREW LO: Multiple for
publishing is higher?

00:54:54.150 --> 00:54:57.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I think
it would be higher unless

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.355
it's [INAUDIBLE] particular--

00:54:59.355 --> 00:55:00.480
ANDREW LO: And why is that?

00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:02.640
What's the logic
for IT being higher?

00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:04.372
AUDIENCE: Higher
growth potential.

00:55:04.372 --> 00:55:06.330
ANDREW LO: Higher growth
potential, that's one.

00:55:06.330 --> 00:55:08.760
Also, profit margins
tend to be higher.

00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.620
Publishing is not
a growing business.

00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:12.369
I don't know how many
of you realize that.

00:55:12.369 --> 00:55:14.670
Because of the internet,
because of text messaging,

00:55:14.670 --> 00:55:17.250
all sorts of
innovations have really

00:55:17.250 --> 00:55:18.610
hurt the publishing business.

00:55:18.610 --> 00:55:20.717
And that's why a
lot of publishers

00:55:20.717 --> 00:55:22.800
have either gone out of
business or have combined,

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:25.450
so that now we have a
few mega publishers.

00:55:25.450 --> 00:55:26.460
Yeah.

00:55:26.460 --> 00:55:31.350
So if you're an
entrepreneur that's

00:55:31.350 --> 00:55:34.140
looking to set up
Bloomberg Press

00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:38.410
and now Bloomberg is using a
particular cost of capital,

00:55:38.410 --> 00:55:40.350
you may say, "Well, hey,
wait a minute, that's

00:55:40.350 --> 00:55:42.600
not the right cost of
capital because publishing

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:43.984
is a different multiple."

00:55:43.984 --> 00:55:45.150
How would you do that, then?

00:55:45.150 --> 00:55:49.750
How would you figure
out what to use in order

00:55:49.750 --> 00:55:52.980
to calculate the value of a
venture for Bloomberg Press?

00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:53.480
Courtney?

00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.438
AUDIENCE: Just look at
the comparable companies

00:55:55.438 --> 00:55:57.728
and take, like, look at all
the betas of all of them,

00:55:57.728 --> 00:55:59.049
and do analysis from them.

00:55:59.049 --> 00:55:59.840
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:03.590
So let's look at other companies
that are in the business

00:56:03.590 --> 00:56:07.767
that we want to get into and
see what kind of beta they have,

00:56:07.767 --> 00:56:09.600
and what the appropriate
cost of capital is.

00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.784
Anant?

00:56:10.784 --> 00:56:12.752
AUDIENCE: So I understand
why they doing that.

00:56:12.752 --> 00:56:16.196
But at the end of the day, if
Bloomberg, the company, has,

00:56:16.196 --> 00:56:19.640
you know, $1 million or
whatever to invest, why would it

00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:23.248
look at going into an area
like this with a lower

00:56:23.248 --> 00:56:26.282
rate of return than, you
know, a product where it could

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:28.004
get a high rate of return?

00:56:28.004 --> 00:56:31.563
Unless you have some facilities,
in which case facilities plus

00:56:31.563 --> 00:56:34.132
rate of return should be
at least equal to the rate

00:56:34.132 --> 00:56:36.000
of return for the economy.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.940
ANDREW LO: So let's hold off on
that discussion for a moment.

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:41.425
I'm not going to try to
justify why they get into it,

00:56:41.425 --> 00:56:43.050
I just want to
understand the mechanics

00:56:43.050 --> 00:56:45.970
of how they decide on whether
or not to get into it.

00:56:45.970 --> 00:56:47.532
I'll come back to why later.

00:56:47.532 --> 00:56:49.740
Let's come back to that in
just a few minutes though.

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:51.810
Before we get to
that, let's figure out

00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:53.370
how they even evaluate.

00:56:53.370 --> 00:56:53.970
All right?

00:56:53.970 --> 00:56:56.940
So I've suggested here
that they might use

00:56:56.940 --> 00:56:59.940
the beta of John Wiley & Sons.

00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:01.800
That's a publicly-traded
publishing company.

00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:06.290
But they could also use
the beta of McGraw-Hill.

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:07.250
Which should we pick?

00:57:07.250 --> 00:57:09.760
McGraw-Hill or John Wiley?

00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.260
Louis?

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.220
AUDIENCE: John Wiley.

00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:11.700
ANDREW LO: Why?

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:14.116
AUDIENCE: Because McGraw-Hill's
not a pure play publisher.

00:57:14.116 --> 00:57:15.110
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:18.760
McGraw-Hill has lots of other
businesses besides publishing.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.100
So while they do do
a lot of publishing,

00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.559
they also do a lot
of other things.

00:57:22.559 --> 00:57:25.058
Give me another business that
McGraw-Hill is involved in it.

00:57:25.058 --> 00:57:25.610
Anybody?

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:26.110
Yeah?

00:57:26.110 --> 00:57:26.850
AUDIENCE: Standard & Poor's?

00:57:26.850 --> 00:57:27.641
ANDREW LO: Exactly.

00:57:27.641 --> 00:57:29.960
McGraw-Hill owns
Standard & Poor's.

00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:33.530
And Standard & Poor's does a lot
of things, including publishing

00:57:33.530 --> 00:57:36.200
ratings as well as indexes.

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:40.290
So those businesses are not
the same as publishing books.

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:44.780
McGraw-Hill has lots
of other subsidiaries,

00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:48.790
whereas John Wiley & Sons,
all they do is publishing.

00:57:48.790 --> 00:57:51.890
They are what is known
as a pure play company.

00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:53.660
So let's take a look.

00:57:53.660 --> 00:58:01.220
This is the revenues of
John Wiley & Sons in 2007.

00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:04.430
If you look at the
core business--

00:58:04.430 --> 00:58:09.420
39% professional trade, 70%
higher ed, 44% scientific,

00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:12.000
technical, and medical--

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.380
that's not a perfect
match for Bloomberg,

00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:18.150
but that's not bad, right?

00:58:18.150 --> 00:58:21.540
That's within the
same general area.

00:58:21.540 --> 00:58:25.080
What we would really prefer
is if it were just this slice

00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:26.970
that we could carve
out and figure out

00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:28.590
what that business looked like.

00:58:28.590 --> 00:58:31.786
But that's not so easy
to do because of the fact

00:58:31.786 --> 00:58:33.660
that it's one company
that's doing all of it.

00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:33.840
Ken?

00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:35.274
AUDIENCE: How much
does size matter?

00:58:35.274 --> 00:58:37.186
How much should Bloomberg
take into consideration

00:58:37.186 --> 00:58:39.186
the fact that John Wyley
is [INAUDIBLE] doing it

00:58:39.186 --> 00:58:40.420
at a different scale?

00:58:40.420 --> 00:58:43.990
ANDREW LO: Well, so I guess I
would be lying if I told you

00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:46.030
that size didn't matter.

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:47.620
That's usually the case.

00:58:47.620 --> 00:58:50.320
Size matters in
the sense that you

00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:52.210
want to have a company
that's representative

00:58:52.210 --> 00:58:53.710
of what you're trying to do.

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:56.470
And smaller companies bear
certain risks that larger

00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:57.640
companies don't.

00:58:57.640 --> 00:59:00.700
And vice versa, larger companies
have access to certain benefits

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.010
and technologies that
smaller companies don't.

00:59:03.010 --> 00:59:05.380
So the point is
that we don't always

00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:07.277
get to choose what's available.

00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:09.610
You've got to look at the
various different alternatives

00:59:09.610 --> 00:59:12.980
out there and the best way to
approach it is to get a range.

00:59:12.980 --> 00:59:14.590
So if you're going
to be doing this

00:59:14.590 --> 00:59:16.450
in a more serious
fashion, what you do

00:59:16.450 --> 00:59:18.850
is to make a study of
the publishing business.

00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:21.370
Find companies at both
ends of the spectrum.

00:59:21.370 --> 00:59:24.160
The small ones and the
big ones, the pure plays

00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:26.830
and the conglomerates,
and estimate

00:59:26.830 --> 00:59:28.720
the cost of capital
for all of them.

00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:32.140
And then say, given this
spectrum of results,

00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:36.430
we think that the appropriate
cost of capital should be here.

00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:39.130
And basically make a
choice after having

00:59:39.130 --> 00:59:40.390
looked at the evidence.

00:59:40.390 --> 00:59:43.390
So what I'm giving you
is not a simple recipe

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:45.100
that will work in
every circumstance

00:59:45.100 --> 00:59:48.550
but rather an approach
that, with sufficient study

00:59:48.550 --> 00:59:51.571
and analysis, will yield
an intelligent answer.

00:59:51.571 --> 00:59:54.070
So let's actually take a look
at the answer here, all right?

00:59:54.070 --> 00:59:56.170
So we've got John
Wiley & Sons, we've

00:59:56.170 --> 01:00:00.040
got their performance over a
period of time, the share price

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.210
and so on.

01:00:01.210 --> 01:00:06.910
If you take the beta of John
Wiley & Sons series A shares,

01:00:06.910 --> 01:00:10.210
and you can get that from
Yahoo, it's a beta of 1.29 as

01:00:10.210 --> 01:00:11.560
of last year.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.940
Then, with a risk-free rate of
5% and a market-risk premium

01:00:15.940 --> 01:00:16.654
of 6%--

01:00:16.654 --> 01:00:18.070
which is when
Bloomberg was trying

01:00:18.070 --> 01:00:21.640
to decide when to go into the
business, about two years ago--

01:00:21.640 --> 01:00:26.770
it turns out that the
cost of capital is 12.7%.

01:00:26.770 --> 01:00:28.990
So that's actually a
pretty reasonable cost

01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:31.510
of capital, which
says that that's

01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:36.430
the number you use in
figuring out whether or not

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:40.180
the cash flows from a
publishing business make sense.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:41.140
OK?

01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.270
Now to Anant's
question, why on earth

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.040
would you do that
when you could invest

01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:47.950
in a business that may have
a higher cost of capital

01:00:47.950 --> 01:00:49.540
or a higher rate of return?

01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:50.770
We don't know that they do.

01:00:50.770 --> 01:00:52.630
In other words, at
this point, Bloomberg

01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:55.030
may not have any
ability to invest

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:57.970
in its current
business or others that

01:00:57.970 --> 01:00:59.750
have a higher rate of return.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:04.120
So one could argue that a
cost of capital of about 12.7%

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.120
is actually a pretty reasonable
hurdle rate for a new business.

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.940
So in other words, I would
only invest in this business

01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.710
if it yielded a positive NPV.

01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:16.330
Now a positive NPV means
it's earning more than 12.7%

01:01:16.330 --> 01:01:18.210
on average, right?

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:21.340
That's a pretty good rate of
return for a new business.

01:01:21.340 --> 01:01:24.320
Now, there is another
business that Bloomberg

01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:27.774
could get into which is the
hedge fund business, right?

01:01:27.774 --> 01:01:28.440
I mean, why not?

01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:30.856
They've got all this data,
they may as well make use of it

01:01:30.856 --> 01:01:32.420
and turn into a hedge fund.

01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.420
Now, that business, I suspect
that the cost of capital

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.800
is a lot higher.

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.580
Higher because the riskiness
is more substantial.

01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.280
And there, you have to start
talking about the riskiness

01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:44.570
of bankruptcy.

01:01:44.570 --> 01:01:46.670
Would it really be a
good idea to jeopardize

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:49.580
Bloomberg's entire franchise
on one mega hedge fund?

01:01:49.580 --> 01:01:50.830
I don't know, maybe?

01:01:50.830 --> 01:01:53.630
But probably not,
if you really are

01:01:53.630 --> 01:01:56.870
serious about preserving the
franchise value the company.

01:01:56.870 --> 01:01:57.370
Mike?

01:01:57.370 --> 01:01:58.486
AUDIENCE: So then,
to that point,

01:01:58.486 --> 01:02:00.870
how do you consider the impact
on the rest of Bloomberg,

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:03.712
given this
additonal-- if they go

01:02:03.712 --> 01:02:04.962
into this additional division?

01:02:04.962 --> 01:02:07.087
ANDREW LO: Well, so that's
the project interactions

01:02:07.087 --> 01:02:08.510
that I haven't talked about.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:12.740
Up until now, I'm assuming this
is a standalone subsidiary.

01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:16.540
And I'm evaluating it
as positive NPV or not.

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:17.300
OK?

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.180
The next step in the
capital budgeting process

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:23.870
is to then ask the question,
OK, as a standalone entity,

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:25.190
I think I understand it.

01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:28.117
I got the cash flows down, I
got the discount rate down.

01:02:28.117 --> 01:02:29.450
I know what the comparisons are.

01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:34.260
I've evaluated the NPV
and it looks positive.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:38.900
Now let me ask, what does this
do strategically for the firm?

01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:41.180
That's the third question,
the strategic options.

01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.410
Is it good?

01:02:42.410 --> 01:02:43.940
Or is it not so good?

01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.720
And if so can I put
a number on that?

01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.480
Now, from Bloomberg, I wasn't
involved in any discussions

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:53.180
internally so I can't tell you
what Bloomberg came up with.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:55.400
But from what I
gather, they decided

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:58.250
that there are some positive
synergies between a business

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:03.949
press and their other
media type of access.

01:03:03.949 --> 01:03:05.990
That they felt that there
were some cross-selling

01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:08.152
opportunities so that,
when there was a good book,

01:03:08.152 --> 01:03:09.860
they could put it on
the Bloomberg screen

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:12.390
and advertise free, basically.

01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:14.150
And then the print
media would actually

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:16.790
help to support
attention to Bloomberg

01:03:16.790 --> 01:03:19.460
as an outlet for news.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:23.990
So in that case, they determined
that this interaction was all

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:26.642
good, that there wasn't
a downside to it.

01:03:26.642 --> 01:03:28.100
And part of the
reason, I think, is

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.516
because they were
able to assemble

01:03:29.516 --> 01:03:32.660
a team of very experienced
publishers and editors.

01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:35.000
They pulled them out of
other publishing firms

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.010
to start this new
venture, and they ended up

01:03:37.010 --> 01:03:38.840
getting some really
good people involved.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:41.006
And I've had the pleasure
to work with some of them.

01:03:41.006 --> 01:03:42.680
They are very,
very professional.

01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.694
So Bloomberg actually made a
pretty good decision, at least

01:03:46.694 --> 01:03:48.860
from the perspective of
getting this thing launched.

01:03:48.860 --> 01:03:50.630
Whether or not it will
be profitable, who knows?

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:52.520
It's only been around
for a couple of years,

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:54.800
but so far they've developed
a pretty impressive list

01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:56.310
of authors.

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:56.895
Yeah?

01:03:56.895 --> 01:03:57.765
AUDIENCE: I guess
what I'm saying--

01:03:57.765 --> 01:03:59.264
Let's just say the
rest of Bloomberg

01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:00.970
had a cost of capital of 10.

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:04.110
They go to this, let's say
it pulls everything up to 11.

01:04:04.110 --> 01:04:06.487
The rest of their business
is now more expensive.

01:04:06.487 --> 01:04:07.570
That was more my question.

01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:10.029
Will we include the
value of destruction

01:04:10.029 --> 01:04:12.570
on the rest of their business
for raising their overall cost?

01:04:12.570 --> 01:04:13.650
ANDREW LO: Well, so--

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:16.620
If there's any kind of value
creation or destruction,

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.720
you're implicitly assuming some
kind of market irrationality.

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:22.290
Right?

01:04:22.290 --> 01:04:25.620
Because what you're assuming is
that, if they pull this thing

01:04:25.620 --> 01:04:28.350
up, they pull up the cost of
capital for the entire firm,

01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:30.660
they lower the valuation
of the entire firm.

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:32.850
You're assuming that
people in the industry

01:04:32.850 --> 01:04:36.060
can't see through the fact
that they've got a subsidiary.

01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:38.880
And in some cases,
you may be right.

01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:41.520
But I would argue that
a better perspective is

01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:44.490
to say that analysts
are going to be

01:04:44.490 --> 01:04:47.190
able to do
division-by-division valuation

01:04:47.190 --> 01:04:49.227
and say, OK, they got
a publishing division.

01:04:49.227 --> 01:04:51.060
These are the revenues,
these are the costs,

01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:53.197
they're segregated, and
it makes sense for them,

01:04:53.197 --> 01:04:54.030
given the synergies.

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:55.030
Blah, blah, blah.

01:04:55.030 --> 01:04:57.690
So I would expect that
those considerations may not

01:04:57.690 --> 01:04:58.610
be as significant.

01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:03.180
Now if, on the other hand,
this publishing operation

01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:05.254
were really big--

01:05:05.254 --> 01:05:07.670
In other words, if it ended
up that it grew so big that it

01:05:07.670 --> 01:05:11.810
accounted for half of the
revenues of Bloomberg,

01:05:11.810 --> 01:05:15.636
the entity, then I think your
point would be well taken,

01:05:15.636 --> 01:05:16.760
would be much more serious.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.454
Right now, it's a
tiny, little blip

01:05:19.454 --> 01:05:20.870
in the grand scheme
of things that

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:22.460
may turn into something big.

01:05:22.460 --> 01:05:24.980
But for example, if you're
an investment bank--

01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.410
Nowadays, we don't have any
more of those but at one point

01:05:27.410 --> 01:05:28.340
we did.

01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:32.450
If you're an investment bank
and you've got a franchise based

01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:36.230
upon customer-driven
business, very reliable,

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:42.470
very high multiples, very, very
valuable kind of franchise--

01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:43.970
And then the question
is, should you

01:05:43.970 --> 01:05:46.330
get involved in prop trading?

01:05:46.330 --> 01:05:48.160
Prop trading,
proprietary trading,

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.550
basically being a
hedge fund, carries

01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:54.190
in the marketplace no multiple.

01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:57.460
Actually in some cases,
the multiple is negative,

01:05:57.460 --> 01:05:59.240
I mean, that is, less than 1.

01:05:59.240 --> 01:05:59.770
Right?

01:05:59.770 --> 01:06:03.270
Because if you're thinking
about acquiring a hedge fund,

01:06:03.270 --> 01:06:04.895
the typical hedge
fund will provide you

01:06:04.895 --> 01:06:06.686
with whatever earnings
they have this year,

01:06:06.686 --> 01:06:08.250
but next year they
could blow up.

01:06:08.250 --> 01:06:12.000
So there is no multiple assigned
to hedge funds, typically.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:12.872
Not always.

01:06:12.872 --> 01:06:15.330
I can give you examples over
the last couple of years where

01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:17.430
hedge funds have
sold for multiples,

01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:19.810
but there are not many of them.

01:06:19.810 --> 01:06:22.410
And typically, a
hedge fund, when

01:06:22.410 --> 01:06:25.920
you look at the value of the
future earnings, the multiple

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.840
that is applied
can be less than 1

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:31.860
if there is a concern that
the hedge fund can drag down

01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:34.680
the value of the parent company.

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.370
So there are situations
where, for a distress sale,

01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:41.960
people have paid $0.50 on the
dollar of assets of a hedge

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:42.890
fund.

01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:45.464
Of the actual cash that the
hedge fund has generated

01:06:45.464 --> 01:06:46.880
for its shareholders,
they've paid

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:50.750
less than a dollar for dollar
because of that kind of effect

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:52.190
on the parent company.

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:54.050
Goldman Sachs, after
they went public,

01:06:54.050 --> 01:06:57.860
they really had a lot of
difficulty internally,

01:06:57.860 --> 01:07:00.770
thinking about prop trading,
because prop trading accounted

01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:04.100
during certain years for such
a large fraction of the Goldman

01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.014
franchise that it ended
up having the effect

01:07:07.014 --> 01:07:08.180
that Mike was talking about.

01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:10.460
That is, people said,
gee, Goldman is nothing

01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.630
but a prop trading firm.

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:13.505
I'm not going to give
it a multiple of seven.

01:07:13.505 --> 01:07:15.350
Let's try a multiple
of 2 and 1/2.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:17.240
That is value destruction.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.900
That's a concern.

01:07:18.900 --> 01:07:21.110
But for small
projects that aren't

01:07:21.110 --> 01:07:23.150
about the entire
corporation, that

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:25.100
aren't likely to
affect the perception

01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:28.010
of the entire corporation, you
don't have to worry about that.

01:07:28.010 --> 01:07:30.540
So size does matter
in another way.

01:07:30.540 --> 01:07:31.290
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE]?

01:07:31.290 --> 01:07:32.664
AUDIENCE: How did
you with, like,

01:07:32.664 --> 01:07:33.990
[INAUDIBLE] and risk-free rate?

01:07:33.990 --> 01:07:35.686
So today what rate
would be used?

01:07:35.686 --> 01:07:38.480
ANDREW LO: Today I'd use 1%.

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:42.470
So this is the time element
that I mentioned to you before.

01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:44.690
When you take on
a project, you've

01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:46.700
got to have the right time.

01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.240
It's got to be the right time.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.670
And so things change.

01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:51.920
The cost of capital changes.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:55.556
So right now, I would use 1%
for this particular project.

01:07:55.556 --> 01:07:56.930
So you might think
it'd be easier

01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:59.780
to get it launched,
but try getting cash

01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:02.000
in a setting like today.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:02.500
Yeah?

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:03.125
AUDIENCE: If you
start a project,

01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:05.330
say it's a two-year project
and you start it at 1%,

01:08:05.330 --> 01:08:07.496
and then all of a sudden
the risk-free rate goes up.

01:08:07.496 --> 01:08:09.330
Does that mean that you
might, economically,

01:08:09.330 --> 01:08:11.162
need to cancel your
project halfway through?

01:08:11.162 --> 01:08:12.370
ANDREW LO: Yeah, absolutely.

01:08:12.370 --> 01:08:13.220
Yeah.

01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:16.130
At one point, John
Maynard Keynes

01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:19.380
was criticized for flip
flopping on the gold standard

01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:22.591
and Keynes had a very, very
sensible reply, which I think

01:08:22.591 --> 01:08:23.840
I may have mentioned in class.

01:08:23.840 --> 01:08:27.510
Which is that, when the facts
change, sir, I change my mind.

01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:30.050
What do you do?

01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:31.189
So absolutely.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.501
If cost of capital
changes a year from now,

01:08:33.501 --> 01:08:35.000
you may have to
cancel your project.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.399
Or you may wish you had
taken two of the projects,

01:08:37.399 --> 01:08:38.960
but you didn't get to.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.956
These kinds of project
interactions over time

01:08:40.956 --> 01:08:42.080
make it really complicated.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:44.359
That's one of the reasons why
we have a whole separate course

01:08:44.359 --> 01:08:45.817
on capital budgeting,
is to come up

01:08:45.817 --> 01:08:48.200
with tools to deal with
these kind of interactions.

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:49.140
So absolutely.

01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:51.015
In fact, I'm going to
give an example of that

01:08:51.015 --> 01:08:54.080
in just a minute where
that time element actually

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:56.240
is very important.

01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.359
Let's actually go
over that right now.

01:08:59.359 --> 01:09:02.590
So here's an example that
you don't know how to do yet.

01:09:02.590 --> 01:09:04.590
We're going to figure out
how to do it together.

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:05.240
All right?

01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:08.330
And it has to do with
time and with risks.

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:14.450
So a firm is investing in
an oil exploration project.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:18.215
We're going to drill a bunch
of holes in a particular area

01:09:18.215 --> 01:09:20.250
where I'm trying to find oil.

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:23.100
And it's going to take
time to drill these holes.

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:26.500
So it's going to
take at least a year.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.529
And at the end of
the first year,

01:09:28.529 --> 01:09:31.260
there's going to be
a probability of 1/3

01:09:31.260 --> 01:09:34.200
that we find three
million barrels of oil.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.569
But there's a probability
of 2/3 that we find nothing,

01:09:36.569 --> 01:09:39.950
we come up dry.

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:43.000
1/3, 2/3 probability.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:48.100
Now, if we are successful with
that 1/3 probability, then

01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:50.439
the 3 million
barrels of oil will

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:54.262
be pumped out of the ground
by the end of the second year.

01:09:54.262 --> 01:09:56.470
So at the end of the first
year, if we're successful,

01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:58.300
we'll find oil.

01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:01.330
And then it'll take a year
to extract it and barrel it.

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.920
Put it in barrels and sell it.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.140
And we'll have 3
million barrels to be

01:10:05.140 --> 01:10:07.540
able to do that,
and then after that,

01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.000
the field will be depleted.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.080
Now the expected after-tax
profit per barrel is $20.

01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:19.010
We're going to make
$20 a barrel after-tax.

01:10:19.010 --> 01:10:22.390
Not now, but a year from now.

01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:24.940
The risk-free rate is 5%.

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:27.730
The industry discount rate
of oil production is 20%.

01:10:27.730 --> 01:10:30.130
That's a very high
cost of capital.

01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:33.640
But oil production is
a high beta activity,

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:35.470
as you can sort of tell, right?

01:10:35.470 --> 01:10:37.450
Market prices are down.

01:10:37.450 --> 01:10:39.490
Oil prices down.

01:10:39.490 --> 01:10:43.210
When the market was up, oil
prices were pretty high.

01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:45.130
Oil has a high beta, OK?

01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:49.480
So the discount rate is 20%,
but the exploration risk--

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.630
this 1/3, 2/3 probability--

01:10:52.630 --> 01:10:53.790
that has a beta of 0.

01:10:57.474 --> 01:10:58.765
What's the NPV of this project?

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:03.050
How do you figure that out?

01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:05.810
Believe it or not, you
actually have all the tools

01:11:05.810 --> 01:11:07.590
to solve this problem.

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:09.140
But it's hard.

01:11:09.140 --> 01:11:11.900
And not only is it
hard for all of you,

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.325
it's actually hard
for professionals.

01:11:14.325 --> 01:11:16.700
A couple of years ago, I taught
the Sloan Fellows program

01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.230
during the summer.

01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:20.813
I don't know how much you know
about the Sloan Fellows program

01:11:20.813 --> 01:11:23.810
but this is a program where
we bring executives who've

01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:27.200
worked for 15, 20, 30
years, made their fortunes,

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:30.680
and have decided to take a
year off to get a degree.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:36.020
And so these are very
seasoned, senior professionals,

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:39.680
so teaching them is a
whole other challenge.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.460
They're very-- they know a lot.

01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.300
And they know a lot
about virtually anything

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.620
and everything you ever
care to talk about.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:49.220
To case in point,
I gave this example

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.817
to the Sloan Fellows class.

01:11:51.817 --> 01:11:53.900
Somebody in the back of
the room said, "Excuse me.

01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.130
First, Lo, but I don't
recall that we actually used

01:11:57.130 --> 01:12:02.092
this analysis when we were
doing oil exploration."

01:12:02.092 --> 01:12:04.550
And I said, well, why don't
you tell us about what you did,

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:06.470
and who you are, and so on.

01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:10.610
And the fellow said, "Well,
I'm the senior vice-president

01:12:10.610 --> 01:12:13.665
for oil exploration
at Saudi Aramco."

01:12:13.665 --> 01:12:16.880
This is the biggest oil
company in the world,

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.990
and he was the man in charge
of drilling those holes.

01:12:20.990 --> 01:12:24.110
And he actually said that
they didn't do this analysis,

01:12:24.110 --> 01:12:26.390
but that he actually
was going to try it out

01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:29.930
because he thought it
made a lot of sense.

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:32.685
So that was a little
scary, I have to tell you.

01:12:32.685 --> 01:12:35.480
A very intimidating audience.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:39.176
But the point is that this
is a very subtle idea.

01:12:39.176 --> 01:12:40.300
Let me tell you what it is.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.390
Let me tell you
how it works, OK?

01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:45.210
There are two risks
going on here.

01:12:45.210 --> 01:12:48.630
There is the market risk
of pumping the oil out

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.460
of the ground and selling it.

01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:52.890
And that we
understand quite well.

01:12:52.890 --> 01:12:57.870
That has a beta given by this
particular cost of capital,

01:12:57.870 --> 01:12:58.890
20%.

01:12:58.890 --> 01:13:01.380
So we already know
what the discount rate

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:05.057
is in that second year.

01:13:05.057 --> 01:13:07.640
But we need to figure out how
to discount from the second year

01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.470
to the first year.

01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:13.820
What should the appropriate
risk-adjusted discount rate

01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:17.960
is from the first year
back to year zero.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:18.901
That's the key.

01:13:18.901 --> 01:13:19.400
Right?

01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:20.600
That's the hard part.

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.280
At the end of the
second year, we're

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.500
going to have 3
million barrels of oil,

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:31.460
each priced at $20 a barrel for
a profit of $60 million, right?

01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.120
Or $6 million here.

01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.040
Yeah.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:37.982
So $60 million at
the end of two years.

01:13:37.982 --> 01:13:39.440
Now we're going to
discount it back

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:44.125
to the beginning of
that two year period.

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:46.000
So in other words, we're
going to discount it

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.910
from the end of the second
year to the beginning

01:13:48.910 --> 01:13:51.460
of that second year, or
the end of the first year,

01:13:51.460 --> 01:13:54.030
and that's what we get
as $50 million, right?

01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:58.180
$60 million discounted
back by 20% discount rate,

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:04.850
that's $50 million at year
one, if we strike oil.

01:14:04.850 --> 01:14:08.690
But there's a 1/3 probability
that we strike oil.

01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:11.240
There's a 2/3 probability
that we don't.

01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:15.230
The question is, what do we
discount this possibility back

01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:16.550
to year zero?

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:22.070
And I'm going to argue you
discount it back, not at 20%

01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:24.460
but at 5%.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:25.790
5%?

01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:28.370
That's the risk-free rate.

01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:30.420
Now, why on earth
would you do that?

01:14:30.420 --> 01:14:33.430
This is the oil industry
we're talking about.

01:14:33.430 --> 01:14:37.570
The reason you discount the
first year back to year zero

01:14:37.570 --> 01:14:42.540
at risk-free rate is because
the risk of coming up dry,

01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:47.310
that risk is completely
diversifiable.

01:14:47.310 --> 01:14:49.870
That is complete,
idiosyncratic risk.

01:14:49.870 --> 01:14:52.260
There is no beta, right?

01:14:52.260 --> 01:14:55.980
The oil deposits
underground don't

01:14:55.980 --> 01:14:58.200
know whether it's a bull
market or a bear market.

01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.460
They couldn't care less.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.690
They're either there
or they're not there,

01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:03.360
and you're drilling for it.

01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:09.310
So your risk of not striking oil
has no bearing on the market.

01:15:09.310 --> 01:15:12.300
If you are well
diversified, then that risk

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.010
is actually not
something that you're

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.780
going to get rewarded for.

01:15:15.780 --> 01:15:17.730
And therefore, you
need to discount it

01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:19.240
at the risk-free rate.

01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:26.500
So in fact, the NPV of this
project is $15.9 million,

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.820
which is a lot bigger number
than if you were to discount it

01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.095
by 20% both years.

01:15:32.095 --> 01:15:34.620
But it's because the
risks are different.

01:15:34.620 --> 01:15:38.960
So to Brian's point, when
risk changes over time,

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.710
you've got to use the
appropriate discount

01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:43.180
rate for that
particular kind of risk.

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:46.470
Now, it just so happens that
here ahead of time, we actually

01:15:46.470 --> 01:15:49.200
understood where the
risks were coming from.

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:52.200
So we know the risks between
year zero and year one

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:55.430
are different from the risks
between year one and year two.

01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:57.180
You've got to use the
appropriate discount

01:15:57.180 --> 01:15:58.380
rate for that kind of risk.

01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:01.710
This is a very subtle
problem that you

01:16:01.710 --> 01:16:06.270
have to think about carefully
in order to understand it fully.

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:10.080
But it's an important one so
that's why I spent time on it.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.880
Any questions about this?

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:12.690
Any debate?

01:16:12.690 --> 01:16:13.360
Any argument?

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.800
Do you agree with this?

01:16:14.800 --> 01:16:16.020
Does this make sense to you?

01:16:16.020 --> 01:16:19.530
If it doesn't make
sense, speak up now

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:21.341
or forever hold your peace.

01:16:21.341 --> 01:16:21.840
Right?

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.080
Because it's important
that you absorb the lesson

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:27.160
from this particular example.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:28.120
Yeah, Andy?

01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:32.070
AUDIENCE: So suppose that
you know for a fact there's

01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:38.164
a third of 20 million
barrels in the ground.

01:16:38.164 --> 01:16:39.602
You consider the same project?

01:16:39.602 --> 01:16:40.880
That has the exact same--

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:41.880
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.330
AUDIENCE: --value?

01:16:42.330 --> 01:16:43.330
ANDREW LO: That's right.

01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:43.860
Absolutely.

01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:47.280
Because there, you
have no uncertainty.

01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:49.320
And you're just simply
taking the expected value

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.900
and assuming that you're
getting the expected value.

01:16:51.900 --> 01:16:55.020
And it's because the
uncertainty of this project

01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:57.330
in the first year is
completely diversifiable.

01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:58.980
It's a coin flip.

01:16:58.980 --> 01:16:59.790
It's a coin flip.

01:16:59.790 --> 01:17:01.289
And you're not going
to get rewarded

01:17:01.289 --> 01:17:03.840
for bearing that coin flip
because, if you diversify--

01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:04.800
Put it another way.

01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:07.650
Suppose you were Saudi Aramco
and, instead of doing one

01:17:07.650 --> 01:17:11.490
of these fields, you did 100?

01:17:11.490 --> 01:17:13.980
Well, then you've
diversified across all sorts

01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:18.120
of possible coin flips, and
then the law of large numbers

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:23.100
would actually reduce your
payoff to something very, very

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.240
riskless, or close to riskless.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:25.740
Right?

01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:29.746
Ted?

01:17:29.746 --> 01:17:32.740
AUDIENCE: Would you
just restate again

01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:36.570
why the first year is
at 5% as opposed to 20%?

01:17:36.570 --> 01:17:37.260
ANDREW LO: Sure.

01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:40.710
The first year is the 5%
because I told you here

01:17:40.710 --> 01:17:45.220
that the exploration risk is
completely non-systematic.

01:17:45.220 --> 01:17:46.920
It's zero beta.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.680
So when you're drilling
for holes, whether or not

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.600
you find oil or
you don't find oil

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:55.620
has absolutely no bearing
on whether the market is

01:17:55.620 --> 01:17:56.520
up or down.

01:17:56.520 --> 01:17:58.970
There's no correlation.

01:17:58.970 --> 01:18:00.980
If there's no
correlation, then that

01:18:00.980 --> 01:18:03.317
means that it's a kind
of risk that you're not

01:18:03.317 --> 01:18:04.400
going to get rewarded for.

01:18:04.400 --> 01:18:06.830
This is the Irish jig
dance-- you know, the dancing

01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:08.090
on that platform.

01:18:08.090 --> 01:18:10.310
You're not going to get
paid extra for dancing

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:13.410
an Irish jig on that platform
when you're window washing.

01:18:13.410 --> 01:18:14.240
OK?

01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:17.330
So the key here is this
statement right here.

01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:19.970
The exploration risk
is non-systematic.

01:18:19.970 --> 01:18:23.895
If the exploration risk were
systematic for any reason, then

01:18:23.895 --> 01:18:25.520
of course, you'd have
to use a discount

01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.520
rate that would be commensurate
with the appropriate beta.

01:18:28.520 --> 01:18:30.090
And there's no
telling that that beta

01:18:30.090 --> 01:18:33.410
is going to be the same
as pumping the oil out.

01:18:33.410 --> 01:18:36.170
Oil exploration is not the
same thing as oil production.

01:18:36.170 --> 01:18:38.960
There are two different
kinds of activities

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:43.070
that carry with it
different kinds of risks.

01:18:43.070 --> 01:18:45.800
OK?

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.760
Other questions or comments?

01:18:48.760 --> 01:18:49.260
Yeah?

01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:49.964
[INAUDIBLE]

01:18:49.964 --> 01:18:52.005
AUDIENCE: How often does
this happen in practice?

01:18:52.005 --> 01:18:54.480
I mean, most of the time
during my experience,

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.004
we would forecast that 15
or 20 years down the line.

01:18:57.004 --> 01:18:57.670
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

01:18:57.670 --> 01:19:00.010
AUDIENCE: Most of the time
we would pick a discount

01:19:00.010 --> 01:19:01.440
rate that, you know, tries to--

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.982
It's a level discount rate.

01:19:02.982 --> 01:19:05.019
We're not going to, you
know, try and change

01:19:05.019 --> 01:19:05.810
that discount rate.

01:19:05.810 --> 01:19:06.450
ANDREW LO: Right.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:07.290
AUDIENCE: It could be 10 year--

01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:08.190
ANDREW LO: Yeah.

01:19:08.190 --> 01:19:10.560
So the answer is, it
depends on the industry.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:14.520
For certain industries where
you cannot identify discrete

01:19:14.520 --> 01:19:17.700
changes in the riskiness
of the activities,

01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.260
then it makes sense.

01:19:19.260 --> 01:19:22.744
The only thing you can do is to
come up with one discount rate.

01:19:22.744 --> 01:19:24.160
But for industries
like this where

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.370
there are discrete phases
of these different projects,

01:19:27.370 --> 01:19:29.830
then you actually do use
different discount rates.

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:33.220
Because the uncertainty
resolves in a different manner,

01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:35.090
depending on the industry.

01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:37.180
So if you keep in
mind the lesson

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:39.880
that the appropriate
discount rate should

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:43.510
be commensurate with the risks
of that particular cash flow--

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:46.600
Think of each cash flow
as a piece of paper

01:19:46.600 --> 01:19:49.720
that you're auctioning off
to people in a marketplace.

01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:52.570
And ask the question, what would
those folks in the marketplace

01:19:52.570 --> 01:19:55.690
demand in terms of the
appropriate compensation

01:19:55.690 --> 01:19:57.040
for that kind of risk?

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.390
You'll be able to make
the right decisions.

01:19:59.390 --> 01:20:00.160
OK?

01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.320
And if you can't tell,
then you may as well

01:20:02.320 --> 01:20:03.650
use one discount rate.

01:20:03.650 --> 01:20:05.620
If you can't tell one
cash flow from another,

01:20:05.620 --> 01:20:08.009
then what you're telling me
is that, effectively, it's

01:20:08.009 --> 01:20:09.050
the same kind of project.

01:20:12.090 --> 01:20:12.590
OK.

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:13.520
We're out of time.

01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:15.122
I wish you all a
Happy Thanksgiving.

01:20:15.122 --> 01:20:16.580
We'll see you on
Monday where we're

01:20:16.580 --> 01:20:18.620
going to continue on
with capital budgeting

01:20:18.620 --> 01:20:22.330
and do some more applications.

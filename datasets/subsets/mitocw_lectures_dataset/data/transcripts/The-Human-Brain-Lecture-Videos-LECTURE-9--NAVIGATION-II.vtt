[CLICKING]

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:11.700
NANCY KANWISHER: So we're
talking about navigation--

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.590
how you know where
you are and how

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.680
you can get from here to
wherever else you want to go.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.920
And last time we talked about
just the general problems that

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.140
arise in navigation,
and we talked

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.690
about the parahippocampal
place area

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.970
and other parts
of the brain that

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.530
are involved in navigation.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.130
So today we're going
to continue that,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.850
but we're going to talk more
about the actual populations

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.670
of neurons in your head that
are involved in doing this.

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.590
And we'll talk about
a particular aspect

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.710
of the problem of navigation,
which is called reorientation.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.050
That is what happens when
you lose your bearings,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.120
and you need to figure
out where you are again.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.130
Reset your internal
map of where you are.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.020
And then we'll
talk about the idea

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.760
that this whole
system for navigation,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.300
cool as it is and fascinating
as navigation itself is,

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.630
is even more interesting because
there's increasing evidence

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:02.670
that we use that
same system for lots

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.190
of other aspects of
high level cognition

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.010
that have nothing to
do with space per se.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.560
OK that's-- and then we'll
have a quiz, a short quiz.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.550
That's the agenda.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.130
Here we go.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.270
So the basic problems
of navigation are, one,

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.470
where am I?

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.950
And two, how do I get from here
to wherever else I want to go?

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.910
And as I mentioned last time,
we can break down each of these

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.920
into a bunch of
different components

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.520
and facets of that question.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.820
So when we want to
know where we are,

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.220
that can involve recognizing
a familiar location.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.760
So if you see a photograph
or you were plunked down

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.775
spontaneously in an
environment someplace you know,

00:01:38.775 --> 00:01:41.038
you would visually recognize
it, and that would be

00:01:41.038 --> 00:01:42.330
one way to know where you were.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:45.010
Like, this is my living room.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:46.793
Even if that location
is unfamiliar

00:01:46.793 --> 00:01:48.210
and you're plunked
down at random,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.820
you still have some idea of
what kind of a place this is.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.460
Am I in a natural environment?

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:53.470
An urban environment?

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.240
Am I inside?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.520
Am I outside, et cetera?

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.250
And finally, you
would have some sense

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.870
of where you are with respect
to the immediate bounding

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.730
structures in your
immediate environment.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.950
Like, for example, where
you are in this room.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.570
As I'm talking to
you right now, I'm

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.570
aware that there's
a wall behind me.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.740
That kind of immediate
spatial location.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.477
In terms of questions
that arise when

00:02:18.477 --> 00:02:21.060
we have to figure out how do we
get from here to wherever else

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.940
we want to go.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.613
If you can directly see
or hear your destination,

00:02:27.613 --> 00:02:29.280
then you have the
simplest possible kind

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.140
of navigation strategy.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.150
You just go toward that thing.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.150
OK, that's called beaconing, and
it's like the minimalist case.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.750
Works great if you can see
or hear your destination.

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.020
But when you can't,
you need to know,

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.290
where am I in my
broader understanding

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.410
of the layout of my environment
and where is my goal.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.168
And for that, you need a
mental map of your environment,

00:02:52.168 --> 00:02:53.710
and we'll talk more
about that today.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.740
That's why it's in red.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.847
You also need to know
your current heading

00:02:57.847 --> 00:02:58.680
in that environment.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.930
It's not enough to know
in my map of the world,

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.475
I am here with a dot.

00:03:02.475 --> 00:03:03.960
You needs to know
which way you're

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.540
facing in that map
of the world in order

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.810
to plan your navigation, and
we'll talk about that too.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.940
We also need to know what
routes are possible from here.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.710
So I may want to go over to
Stata and get a cup of coffee.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.710
But I can't go this way.

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.410
I've got to go around because
I can't go through that glass.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.340
OK, and so finally, this
whole magnificent system

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.260
that enables us to
process all this stuff

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.970
works pretty impressively.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.340
But every once in a while,
something will go wrong,

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.550
and it will get the wrong
signal, and then we're lost.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.920
And so then we need a way
to regain our bearings,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.140
and we'll talk about that too.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.650
So last time I talked about
a bunch of brain regions

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.020
that are implicated
in perceiving scenes

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.430
and in navigation.

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.680
We talked about the
parahippocampal place area

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.730
right here and this region over
here, formerly known as TOS,

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.780
now known as OPA.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.280
You don't need to
remember all that.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.290
It's the bit that's out
on the lateral surface

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.360
that we can zap
because it's out there.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.090
And both of those regions
seem to be involved broadly

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.000
in perceiving the shape
of space around you.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.810
We also talked a bit about
retrosplenial cortex,

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.573
that region that's
hiding in the sulcus

00:04:08.573 --> 00:04:10.740
here that you can see better
when you mathematically

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.840
unfold the sulcus, there it is.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.970
Responds more to
scenes than objects.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.579
And that region seems to
be involved in something

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.890
like getting your bearings--
that is the location

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.980
and orientation of where
you are with respect

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:25.390
to your cognitive
map and environment.

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.330
OK, so to make that
a little more vivid,

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.880
I gave you one description
of a patient before,

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.950
but here's from another study.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.370
Patients with damage to
retrosplenial cortex--

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.160
so here's from a
recent article--

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.100
in every case, the
patient with this damage

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.490
was able to recognize landmarks
in their neighborhoods

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.380
and retained a sense
of familiarity.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.370
I know that place.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.820
That's the coffee shop
five blocks from my house.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.370
But despite that,
none of those patients

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.310
were able to find their way
in familiar environments,

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.040
and all but one were
unable to learn new routes.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:03.120
So they can recognize the visual
form of a particular place,

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.710
but they don't know
how to relate that

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.540
to their cognitive
map of the world

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:11.160
and therefore plan
a route from there.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.310
OK, so the part
that I only alluded

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:17.820
to at the end-- yes, question?

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.180
AUDIENCE: OK, is the
retrosplenial cortex

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.727
the home to the cognitive
maps, or is it--

00:05:23.727 --> 00:05:25.060
NANCY KANWISHER: Great question.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.250
We don't exactly know.

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.760
The typical story is that
the home of the cognitive map

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:32.610
is the hippocampus, which
we're about to talk about next

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.960
for reasons I will tell you.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.718
But all of this is a very
active area of research.

00:05:37.718 --> 00:05:39.510
It kills me every time
I do these lectures.

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.160
I look at my old
notes, and I think

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.070
here are these 10
other awesome studies,

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.570
and then I try to fit them in,
and then they just don't fit.

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.153
So actually one
question I want to ask

00:05:47.153 --> 00:05:50.040
you guys after this lecture
is, should I in future,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.490
either later in this course
or in future courses,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.990
allocate even more time, or do
you guys feel like OK, enough

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.100
already with navigation.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.808
But I just think it's
the coolest system.

00:05:57.808 --> 00:06:00.557
So there's lots of
work exactly trying

00:06:00.557 --> 00:06:01.890
to answer that kind of question.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.650
And I'll give you
a current snapshot

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:06.690
of the approximate
state, but all of this

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.060
is in flux and very much
actively investigated.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.230
OK, so cognitive map,
what do we mean by that?

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:19.890
Just to remind you of this
classic study from the 1940s

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:23.248
in rats, where the rat,
when they learned this route

00:06:23.248 --> 00:06:25.290
and then went up here and
found their gold block,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.248
the rat immediately comes
out and goes straight

00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:28.050
toward the goal.

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.750
Telling you they've learned
something much more interesting

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.630
than the series of left and
right turns to get to the goal.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.170
They must have done something
much more like actually learned

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.165
the layout of space and the
relative position of that goal

00:06:40.165 --> 00:06:41.790
so they could come
up with a new vector

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.730
to get there when the
original route was blocked.

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:48.240
OK, and you guys
can do this too.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.930
When your route is blocked,
you come up with a novel route.

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:55.830
And you do that by having some
knowledge of your environment,

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.590
something tantamount
to that in your head,

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.240
some version of that.

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.030
And further, you know
where you are in that map.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.540
Like right now, you
know where you are.

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.010
Now here's the cool thing--

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:10.440
specific neurons
in your hippocampus

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:16.560
right now are firing telling
you that you are right there.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.540
So these neurons are
called place cells,

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.850
and this is what they do.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.580
OK, so I'll be a place
cell, or rather what I'll do

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.000
is I will act out the
activity of a place cell

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.610
by a series of clicks I
will make as I walk around.

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.740
So imagine there's an
electrode in my hippocampus,

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:35.400
and you are hearing the
activity of a single neuron

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.660
in my hippocampus
as I walk around.

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.150
And here's what it would do.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.560
You'd hear background firing.

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:43.920
So it's going to go click,
click, click, click, click.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.392
Noisy background firing.

00:07:45.392 --> 00:07:47.100
Click, click, click,
click, click, click,

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:47.900
click, click, click, click.

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.300
Click, click, click,
click, click, click, click,

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:50.700
click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:52.300
Click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click,

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.700
click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.300
Click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.600
Click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.540
OK, I'm not going
to go down there.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:00.140
Click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.540
Click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.140
Click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.540
Click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.140
Click, click, click, click,
click, click, click, click,

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.140
click, click, click,
click, click, click, click.

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:10.650
So that's one neuron
that fires only when I'm

00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:12.780
right over there, that place.

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.940
It's not where I'm
facing over there.

00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:17.040
It's not what I'm
looking at particularly.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.740
It's when I'm right there.

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.180
OK, that's a place cell.

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:25.500
And so there's lots of place
cells in your hippocampus

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.690
that do that, and they do
it for different locations

00:08:27.690 --> 00:08:29.790
in your environment.

00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:31.950
And all of this was first
worked out, of course,

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.320
in rodents, who
were running around

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:36.809
who had electrodes
in their hippocampus,

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.659
but where those electrodes were
connected with a loose tether

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:42.240
so that the rodent could move
around in their environment

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.210
while recording from individual
neurons in the hippocampus.

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:46.930
OK, so that's the setup.

00:08:46.930 --> 00:08:49.680
And so I'm going to show you
a movie of an aerial view

00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:52.650
of a rodent moving around--

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.570
a rat moving around
in its environment.

00:08:54.570 --> 00:08:56.670
Can you see the
little rat there?

00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:59.310
And what's happening
is this video

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.220
is tracing out the rat's
path with the light gray.

00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.590
And every time that-- and
it's recording from one

00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:08.550
neuron-- every time that neuron
fires, it makes a red dot.

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.440
So this is obviously sped up.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.200
But as the rat moves
around in his environment,

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.930
you see an accumulation
like more firing

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.550
when the rat is right there.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:19.515
It's not which direction
the rat is going

00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:20.640
through when he goes there.

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.170
Just basically
whenever he passes

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:24.870
through that in any
direction, neurons

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:27.460
fire more than anywhere else.

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.550
And then if we take
that and blur it,

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.270
as scientists like to do to
make nice idealized pictures,

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:36.570
that is the place
cell for that neuron.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:40.770
That is the place in
space that that animal has

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.200
to be to make that neuron fire.

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.550
Yeah, question.

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:47.580
AUDIENCE: Is it one dimension?

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.540
I mean, can multiple places
be mapped to the same neuron?

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.040
NANCY KANWISHER:
That's complicated.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.190
In an immediate environment
like this, generally not.

00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:58.710
OK, I'll show you some
examples in a moment.

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.660
It's more complicated
if you follow

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:03.170
that cell when the animal
moves to a new location.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.670
So let me say a few more things,
and then if it's not clear,

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:06.503
I'll take questions.

00:10:06.503 --> 00:10:09.090
Oops, we're going
to see that again.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:12.810
OK, right so in answer
to Sasha's question, here

00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:15.480
are a bunch of place cells
from a rodent exploring

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.110
the same environment.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.860
So you might say, well,
there's a hotspot here

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.580
and a little sub one there.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.850
But in general,
most of these cells

00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:27.660
respond with a hotspot in a
particular single location

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:30.240
in this particular environment.

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:32.640
OK, did you have a different
question about that?

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.340
AUDIENCE: Yes, so
that all depends

00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:39.000
on the rat being conscious
of the fact that it's

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.610
in that place?

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.110
NANCY KANWISHER: Uh-huh.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:41.070
Uh-huh.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.390
If the rat was anesthetized
or if he was blindfolded

00:10:45.390 --> 00:10:47.520
and you passively moved
him around in that space

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:50.190
and he had no idea-- no
way to tell where he was,

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:51.370
that wouldn't work.

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.670
However, if the rat
knows the environment

00:10:53.670 --> 00:10:57.270
and then you do this in
a darkened room where

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.240
he's actively locomoting
around, these things

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.950
will still work pretty
well because rats

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.800
are very good at keeping
track of where they are, even

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.110
without visual cues if
they know the environment.

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:09.210
They'll have other
cues like tactile cues,

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:12.520
and they will know how far
they went in each direction.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.970
Remember I talked briefly
about the Tunisian ants

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.890
doing dead reckoning.

00:11:16.890 --> 00:11:19.608
Keeping track of their vector
and speed at each moment

00:11:19.608 --> 00:11:21.900
and integrating the whole
thing to know where they are.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.108
That's called dead reckoning.

00:11:23.108 --> 00:11:24.495
Rats are pretty
good at that too.

00:11:24.495 --> 00:11:25.620
Another question over here?

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:26.645
Yeah.

00:11:26.645 --> 00:11:28.020
AUDIENCE: For the
place cells, do

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:31.535
they have a map as
well [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:31.535 --> 00:11:32.910
NANCY KANWISHER:
We'll get there.

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:33.600
Great question.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.720
We'll get there.

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.970
I'll just give you the answer.

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:36.990
No, they don't.

00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:39.150
It's too bad.

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:39.990
They could have.

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:41.460
They could have
been all organized,

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:42.750
but it's actually a
little complicated.

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:44.010
How would you organize them?

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:47.830
What if you learned more stuff
off of the edge of space?

00:11:47.830 --> 00:11:50.310
What if you had a whole other
piece of your hippocampus?

00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:52.200
It would be inconvenient,
so maybe that's

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.070
why it doesn't work.

00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:56.460
Whereas with visual space,
your retinotopic information

00:11:56.460 --> 00:11:57.730
always stays the same.

00:11:57.730 --> 00:12:00.570
We don't have to suddenly
add a whole new part

00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:02.580
of retinotopic space,
thereby screwing up

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:04.220
our retinotopic
maps in the brain.

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.225
I'm just making that up
as a possible reason.

00:12:06.225 --> 00:12:07.350
I don't know if that's why.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:10.560
Yeah, sorry, behind you
David, tell me your name.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.400
AUDIENCE: Justice.

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.780
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, right, hi.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.560
AUDIENCE: So I was wondering
if you're in a smaller space

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.910
comparatively or a
bigger space, will

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:26.580
areas of these specific place
cells, what they're mapping to,

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.182
will they also
scale up right now?

00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:29.890
NANCY KANWISHER: That's
a great question.

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:30.890
I don't know the answer.

00:12:30.890 --> 00:12:33.720
My guess is they'll scale
according to the space.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:39.330
So if my fake place cell
fields that I just acted out

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:42.245
over there is maybe five feet
across, if I was then confined

00:12:42.245 --> 00:12:43.620
to a little space,
you'd probably

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:46.770
have smaller ones for that
space, but I don't know.

00:12:46.770 --> 00:12:48.630
Let me say a little
bit more about this.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.090
So just to cash this
out, the place field

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.250
is the location in
space the animal

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:56.610
has to be to make that
hippocampal cell fire.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:01.080
OK, so let's distinguish
that from a receptive

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.510
field in visual cortex,
which is a similar idea

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:04.620
but a different one.

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.690
A receptive field
and visual cortex

00:13:06.690 --> 00:13:08.670
is the location in
the visual field

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:12.607
where a stimulus has to be
to make a visual neuron fire.

00:13:12.607 --> 00:13:14.190
Not where the animal
itself has to be,

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:15.960
where the stimulus has to be.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.950
So keep those ideas separate.

00:13:17.950 --> 00:13:20.490
They're related but different.

00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:24.240
OK, so what about we and
rodents tend to go around mostly

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.250
on a 2D plane.

00:13:26.250 --> 00:13:28.920
That is we have buildings
and trees and stuff.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.640
We sometimes go
up in the z-axis,

00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.330
but mostly we live
in a 2D plane,

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:35.320
but that's not true
of all animals.

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:37.650
So recall the bat that
I mentioned last time.

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.210
These amazing flyers and
navigators who fly in 3D

00:13:42.210 --> 00:13:44.400
and complicated
trajectories and yet

00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:47.250
have amazing abilities
to keep track

00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:51.750
of where they are over 30 to
50 miles that they fly at night

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.600
and even as they change
their orientation.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.960
Well, it turns out that in
the hippocampus of bats,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.880
there's a bunch of work where
people have put remote--

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.300
what do you call these
things-- recording devices

00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.900
on bats, where you can
remotely record neural activity

00:14:09.900 --> 00:14:13.530
in the hippocampus as
the bat flies around.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:16.290
And it turns out that
bats have place cells too,

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:19.670
and their place
cells, as they also

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:22.170
can do this in a lab environment
where they're flying around

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.050
and you keep track of their
location with cameras.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:28.200
So you know exactly where
they are in 3D space.

00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.840
And it turns out that
place cells in bats

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.730
are three dimensional
because bats live

00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:34.470
in a three dimensional world.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:38.880
So whereas rodent-- these would
be a bunch of schematized place

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:43.200
cells for different
hippocampal cells in a rodent,

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.150
these are different place cells
for different hippocampal cells

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.320
in a bat.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:49.950
Make sense?

00:14:49.950 --> 00:14:50.730
Bats need this.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.470
They need to know--
not making sense?

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.990
OK, so the bat is moving
around in three dimensions.

00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:57.690
Its place field isn't just
like the one I did there.

00:14:57.690 --> 00:14:59.760
I can't act this out
because I can't fly,

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:03.150
but that place cell might
fire over in that location.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:06.360
But then if the bat flew
directly above it, it wouldn't.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.945
So it's got three dimensions.

00:15:07.945 --> 00:15:08.445
OK.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.590
OK, so I said before
that I had one of those,

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.610
and I acted it out.

00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.770
But what's the
evidence for that?

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:23.925
The evidence in humans came way
after the evidence in rodents.

00:15:23.925 --> 00:15:25.550
Because as you can
imagine, it's harder

00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:28.040
to arrange to record
from individual neurons

00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.110
in human hippocampus.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.290
Nonetheless, as I've
mentioned a few times

00:15:33.290 --> 00:15:35.330
there are occasional
opportunities

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:37.730
where a neurosurgeon
has stuck an electrode

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.030
in an interesting part of the
brain for clinical reasons,

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.830
and the patient and
the neurosurgeon

00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:46.718
are nice enough to let
scientists collect data.

00:15:46.718 --> 00:15:49.010
So I'm going to show you a
really gross bloody picture.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.990
If that's going to bother
you, just look away.

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:55.250
OK, so this is neurosurgery.

00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.880
You take the skull off,
you take the dura off.

00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:01.310
That's the direct
surface of the brain.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:03.140
The neurosurgeons
stick electrodes

00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:04.290
right on top of there.

00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:07.280
And in this case, they put
them deep inside the brain.

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.640
OK, the gross pictures are gone.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:13.350
We have just a nice
clean X-ray here.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:17.510
So in these cases,
this is a patient

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:20.090
who's got an electrode
sticking straight

00:16:20.090 --> 00:16:22.490
into the brain from
the surface straight

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.010
down n to the hippocampus.

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.660
OK, kind of horrifying,
but sometimes clinically

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:30.680
called for.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.970
Seizures very often
start in the hippocampus,

00:16:32.970 --> 00:16:37.670
so this is a commonplace for
clinicians to put electrodes.

00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:40.760
And so what would you do
if you had a patient who

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.400
was willing to do your short
experiment while hanging out

00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:46.010
in the hospital waiting to
have a seizure with electrodes

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.150
in their hippocampus?

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:51.320
Well, you'd have them
play a little game

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.650
in a virtual space in some kind
of-- you don't even need VR.

00:16:54.650 --> 00:16:57.555
You can use a pretty
cheesy little video game,

00:16:57.555 --> 00:16:59.180
and I'm sure this
one was quite cheesy.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:01.670
This study was
done back in 2003.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:05.720
So they had patients navigate
through a space-- this

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.430
is an aerial view of the space.

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:08.810
The patients didn't see that.

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:12.440
They saw this front view,
and they navigated around

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.460
with the joystick in that space.

00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:19.053
And there were three visually
recognizable locations

00:17:19.053 --> 00:17:20.720
in that space, and
they had to do things

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.089
to go from one
location to another.

00:17:23.089 --> 00:17:25.130
OK, details don't really matter.

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.850
So all the while,
Ekstrom and colleagues

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:31.100
are recording from
individual neurons

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.740
in this patient's hippocampus.

00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:37.050
OK, so here's an
example of a place cell.

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.890
So this is a diagram of the
space I just showed you,

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:43.730
with those three recognizable
locations and other locations

00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:46.130
that the patient could
virtually navigate through

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:47.090
with the joystick.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:49.280
The red lines are the
patient's trajectory

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.470
as they moved around
in that space.

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.930
And the colors
within each square

00:17:53.930 --> 00:17:59.150
are the average firing rate
when the patient navigated

00:17:59.150 --> 00:18:01.230
through that location.

00:18:01.230 --> 00:18:04.850
And so this is the place
field of that individual cell

00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.310
in this patient's brain as
they went through this space.

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.190
Because the firing rate
there was around five hertz

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.710
compared to three hertz
for some other locations

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.050
and mostly lower than that.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.200
OK, does that make sense?

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.080
So just like the
rodent experiment,

00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.950
but it's a person with a
joystick looking at this space

00:18:21.950 --> 00:18:24.410
as they go through this
virtual environment,

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:27.480
and we're mapping out their
place fields like that.

00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:30.080
OK, so that shows
that humans have

00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.790
place fields in
their hippocampus

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.560
just as rodents and bats do.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:34.370
Yeah?

00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:38.863
AUDIENCE: Well, this is
independent of landmarks?

00:18:38.863 --> 00:18:41.030
NANCY KANWISHER: That's a
very complicated question.

00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.220
This patient had
access to landmarks.

00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.330
They are seeing as
they go through.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.810
So one could ask, for
example, if you did it

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.600
with your eyes closed and you
had to go by dead reckoning

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.280
remembering the
left and right turns

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.900
you had in a
familiar environment,

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.390
how well could these things
go, they would go for at least

00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:57.380
a while.

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:59.330
They'd probably go
for longer in rodents

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:01.910
because rodents are more
accustomed to navigating

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:02.450
in the dark.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:06.590
And they rely less on visual
cues and more on other cues.

00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:11.390
But yeah, place cells aren't
just visually responsive.

00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:14.330
So if we had, for
example, if we set up

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:18.680
a distinctive sound
source in this corner

00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:21.350
of the room and a
different-- like say somebody

00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:26.210
was singing quietly over here,
and we tied a dog over there

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:27.800
who was barking.

00:19:27.800 --> 00:19:29.930
And you walked around in
this room with your eyes

00:19:29.930 --> 00:19:33.892
closed, you'd have a good way
to keep track of your bearings

00:19:33.892 --> 00:19:36.350
as you moved around because
you'd know that the singing was

00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:38.808
coming from here and the dog
barking was coming from there.

00:19:38.808 --> 00:19:40.212
You wouldn't be seeing anything.

00:19:40.212 --> 00:19:42.170
Your eyes would be closed,
but your place cells

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:43.600
would work pretty well.

00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:45.620
OK, so whenever
you have some basis

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:48.350
for knowing where you are,
no matter what modality

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:49.640
is telling you that--

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.070
and usually it's
many modalities--

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:53.300
those place cells will go.

00:19:55.910 --> 00:19:57.785
OK, so humans have
these things too.

00:19:57.785 --> 00:20:00.035
So you can think of the place
cell as the kind of "you

00:20:00.035 --> 00:20:03.810
are here" system that is the
whole set of place cells.

00:20:03.810 --> 00:20:05.480
Any one place will
only tell you are you

00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.560
in this particular
location or not.

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:09.080
But you have a
whole array of them,

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:12.320
then collectively, that
whole representation

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.300
across all of those
neurons can tell you

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:17.630
where you are in your
familiar environment.

00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:22.590
OK, but if you want to not
just know where you are

00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:25.910
but you want to go
somewhere else, like there,

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.430
you also need to know
your current heading

00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:31.760
as we discussed last time.

00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.580
So it turns out that there
is a whole other batch

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:38.030
of cells that tell you
what way you're heading.

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:40.340
OK, these are called
head direction cells,

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.980
also first studied in rodents.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:45.770
And each head
direction cell responds

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:49.550
when that rodent is heading
in a particular direction,

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.470
not in another direction.

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:56.540
OK, so for example,
if we're mapping along

00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.362
the x-axis different
heading directions.

00:20:58.362 --> 00:21:00.320
So the rodent is facing
in different directions

00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.460
in his environment.

00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:04.250
You map up the
whole 360 degrees,

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.170
this would be the
response of one cell

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:08.780
as that rodent moves around.

00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.400
This one would be tuned to
this particular direction.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.858
It would fire only when the
rodent was facing this way,

00:21:13.858 --> 00:21:15.650
not when it was facing
this way or this way

00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:18.410
or this way or this way.

00:21:18.410 --> 00:21:21.260
So does everybody get how
where you are in space

00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.520
is different-- that's not a
very good way to show this.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.460
Where you are in space
is different from where

00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.430
you're aimed and headed
in that location.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:35.750
OK, two orthogonal axes of
relevant to your location.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:36.755
Yeah?

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:38.130
AUDIENCE: So this
isn't the angle

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.980
of the head in respect
to the body, right?

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.210
It's the entire--

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:44.120
NANCY KANWISHER: I think
I meant to look that

00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.880
up again because this
question always arises.

00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.855
I think that there's
some muck about that

00:21:48.855 --> 00:21:50.480
in the literature,
which is why I never

00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.890
remember a clear answer.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.200
Usually in a rodent,
especially the same.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.390
Because rodents can turn
their heads a little bit,

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:02.390
but mostly they're going
to keep it aimed the way

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.100
they're moving.

00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:04.850
So I don't know.

00:22:04.850 --> 00:22:06.710
This is a long,
complicated excuse

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:09.350
that I forget what
the answer to that is.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:11.150
But send me an email,
and I'll look it up.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.620
I meant to before this lecture.

00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:15.800
I just ran out of time.

00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.350
OK, most of the time,
they'll be the same.

00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:21.260
Actually, I'm pretty sure it's
which way your body is facing.

00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:22.890
Because if I turn like this--

00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:24.890
well, anyway, I'm
not going that way.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:25.610
Yeah.

00:22:25.610 --> 00:22:30.943
AUDIENCE: Have you found at
least 360 cells for each angle?

00:22:30.943 --> 00:22:33.110
NANCY KANWISHER: You mean,
are there cells for each?

00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:37.880
Yes, yes, they pretty much
evenly tile the 360 degrees

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.110
around the animal.

00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:42.290
Yeah, so collectively,
that whole set of cells,

00:22:42.290 --> 00:22:44.690
just as a collective
set of place cells,

00:22:44.690 --> 00:22:46.940
is sufficient to tell
the animal where it is.

00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:49.010
A collective set of
head direction cells

00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:54.042
is sufficient to tell the
animal which way it's oriented.

00:22:54.042 --> 00:22:56.000
OK, I think we just said--
all these things are

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.997
in a structure called
the-- well, first found

00:22:57.997 --> 00:22:59.580
in the structure
called the subiculum,

00:22:59.580 --> 00:23:00.955
which is part of
the hippocampus.

00:23:00.955 --> 00:23:02.390
But since then,
they've been found

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:03.598
in lots of different regions.

00:23:03.598 --> 00:23:06.090
You don't need to remember that.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:08.420
So they get input from lots
of different information.

00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.200
There's many different ways to
know which way we're oriented.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.910
For example, too bad we
don't have a rotating chair.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:18.410
If we did, I would have done
the following ridiculous thing.

00:23:18.410 --> 00:23:19.610
I would have sat
one of you in it,

00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.080
and told you to close your eyes.

00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.030
And I would suddenly turn it.

00:23:23.030 --> 00:23:25.160
And the person in the
chair would notice that.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:27.230
That's your
vestibular system that

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.880
tells you if your
body is being turned,

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.280
even if you yourself
don't decide to turn it.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.930
It will tell you
if you get turned.

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:36.470
That's another cue that provides
input to the head direction

00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:38.390
cells, just as visual
information does

00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:40.490
and potentially auditory
information and lots

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.543
of other kinds of information.

00:23:42.543 --> 00:23:44.210
So many different
sources of information

00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:46.130
feed in to inform
these head direction

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:47.885
cells about the
orientation of the animal.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.530
All right, so you can think
of this as the brain's compass

00:23:54.530 --> 00:23:57.980
telling the organism
what way they're facing.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.760
And lots of organisms
have versions of this.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:03.890
In the fly, there's
an amazing structure

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.930
that was discovered
just a couple of years

00:24:05.930 --> 00:24:08.570
ago, where there's
a whole layout

00:24:08.570 --> 00:24:10.067
of this little
neural structure--

00:24:10.067 --> 00:24:11.150
I forget what it's called.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:13.610
But actually spatially
in that structure,

00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:17.120
there's a little array
of direction cells.

00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.710
So actually you can see it in a
little spatial map of direction

00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:24.230
in that little
structure in the fly.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:26.190
In humans and
primates and rodents,

00:24:26.190 --> 00:24:29.720
it's not organized
spatially like a literal map

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.460
of direction.

00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.470
OK, so now we have where you
are and which way you're facing.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:38.570
One pool of cells, place
cells for where you are.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:42.230
Another pool of cells for
which way you're heading.

00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:45.050
But those are just-- we're
just getting going here.

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.830
The coolest
navigation-related cells

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.120
are grid cells and
entorhinal cortex.

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.900
OK, so this is a slice
of the brain like this,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.700
showing the hippocampus is
folded up thing right here.

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:03.590
And entorhinal cortex
is just right next door.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:08.990
OK, so an entorhinal
cortex, these things

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:15.200
were discovered around a dozen
years ago, maybe 15 years ago.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.900
And I'm going to show you a
video of a rodent moving around

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:21.510
his environment mapping out
activity, like we saw before.

00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:23.480
But now we're in
entorhinal cortex,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.710
and this neuron is
going to be a grid cell,

00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:28.190
and you'll see why as it
moves around in its space.

00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:31.840
Maybe.

00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:36.470
Come on.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.790
Here we go.

00:25:37.790 --> 00:25:38.930
OK, so there's a rodent.

00:25:38.930 --> 00:25:39.740
He's moving around.

00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.840
That's the tether taking
the neural activity.

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.990
The white dots are every
time this one neuron fires,

00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:47.420
we're following one
neuron this whole time.

00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.240
And the rodent is moving
around, sped up video

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:51.650
so you can see this happening.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.300
And at first, it looks
like completely random.

00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:58.190
But as a rodent keeps migrating
around in his space there,

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:00.860
you start to see that
they're like blobs in there.

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.220
It's not totally random.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:04.790
They're particular blobs
that are clustered.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:11.030
And oh my god, those blobs are
organized in a hexagonal grid.

00:26:11.030 --> 00:26:13.940
It's a hexagon.

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:15.200
Isn't that awesome?

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.380
That's a grid cell.

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.550
And whoops, here we go.

00:26:20.550 --> 00:26:22.860
We don't need to see it again.

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.070
So this is a picture
of what you just saw,

00:26:25.070 --> 00:26:29.630
the trajectory of the animal
and the hot spots in that array.

00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:31.940
And here's a smoothed
mathy version

00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.060
of where the firing is
significant in that space, both

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:38.210
showing you
hexagonal grid cells.

00:26:38.210 --> 00:26:43.230
OK, so this is at first
glance a very weird thing.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:48.740
Why would it help to
have essentially a place

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.690
field that has multiple
different places that

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:51.775
make it fire?

00:26:51.775 --> 00:26:53.900
OK, and actually somebody
else before whether place

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.040
cells have two hot spots.

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:57.830
Place cells generally have one,
but grid cells, as you see,

00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:59.990
have many organized
in this grid.

00:27:03.170 --> 00:27:08.570
So the kind of circuitry and
math of this whole system

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.860
is mind blowing
and super exciting,

00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.880
and the talk that I mentioned
yesterday was on this topic.

00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.380
And many people are
working on this,

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.200
and they're working out like
really deep interesting math

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.940
about how you can
take these cells,

00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:23.390
how they're arranged spatially
in the brain at multiple scales

00:27:23.390 --> 00:27:26.990
and how you can use them
to do path integration

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.120
and keep track of
how far an animal has

00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.255
gone along its trajectory.

00:27:30.255 --> 00:27:31.880
It's a little bit
much for this course,

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.400
but I'll just say the
current thinking is

00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:37.310
what these cells
enable us to do is

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.100
to keep track of how far
we've gone in each direction,

00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.110
and that's really
crucial in navigation.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:45.960
We need to know where we are,
not just by the landmarks

00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:46.460
we see.

00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.980
We need to know how far we've
gone in a given direction

00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.780
and the thought is that
that's the function

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.100
that these grid cells
primarily serve in navigation.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.220
And so that's especially
important for dead reckoning,

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.620
like integrating
where you've gone

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.790
according to your trajectories.

00:28:02.790 --> 00:28:05.760
OK, so you also need head
direction cells at each point.

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.790
So you can of the
head direction cells

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:11.360
as telling you the
orientation of your vector

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.010
and the grid cells
of telling you

00:28:13.010 --> 00:28:15.362
the magnitude of the
vector of how far you went.

00:28:15.362 --> 00:28:17.070
And then you take a
whole bunch of those,

00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:19.280
and you integrate them,
and you know where you've

00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.140
gone from your starting point.

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:24.680
And lots of animals do all
that math in their head.

00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.180
It's pretty
complicated integrals,

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:28.310
but they all do that.

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.290
OK, so this is
super awesome work.

00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.350
And fittingly, the
2014 Nobel Prize

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:42.740
was awarded to the Mosers, a
then husband-wife team, who

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:45.590
discovered the
grid cells and also

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:50.210
to John O'Keefe, who discovered
place cells decades earlier.

00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:54.890
And it's a super exciting
line of work and continuing

00:28:54.890 --> 00:28:56.990
to be very exciting one.

00:28:56.990 --> 00:29:01.910
OK, so so far we've talked about
place cells in the hippocampus,

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:05.420
direction cells in the subiculum
and lots of other places,

00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:08.940
and entorhinal grid cells
and entorhinal cortex.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.790
And this is just a
schematic diagram

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:12.050
of where those locations are.

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.810
The anatomy is complicated,
and you don't need to know it.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:18.620
Know they're all in the
hippocampus and its neighboring

00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:19.580
structures.

00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:23.280
That's good enough for here.

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:26.415
Well, OK, know that the grid
cells are in entorhinal cortex

00:29:26.415 --> 00:29:28.040
and the place cells
are in hippocampus.

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.030
That's worth knowing.

00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:33.350
OK, direction cells
are kind of all over.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:38.400
OK, so that's cool, but there's
one more cool kind of cell--

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:39.650
actually there's several more.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:42.680
The new one I never heard of
was reported in this job talk

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.240
yesterday, but we
won't go there.

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:46.430
We'll try to keep it simple.

00:29:46.430 --> 00:29:51.200
Another well-established
one is called a border cell.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:55.460
So these are the place fields
of three different neurons

00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:59.300
from an animal moving
around in this space.

00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:02.300
OK, so you see how these
are very interesting kind

00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:03.320
of place fields.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.090
They're not just
a nice round blob.

00:30:05.090 --> 00:30:07.070
They stretch around
a whole order

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:09.390
of the animal's environment.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.530
OK, so does that make
you think of anything?

00:30:12.530 --> 00:30:14.510
Does that ring any
bells with other stuff

00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:15.680
we've talked about in here?

00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:21.170
I think we've talked
a bunch about how

00:30:21.170 --> 00:30:24.290
the parahippocampal place area
cares about the shape of space

00:30:24.290 --> 00:30:25.455
around you.

00:30:25.455 --> 00:30:27.080
Well, you might think
that you'd really

00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:30.110
want to have awareness of
where you are with respect

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.570
to navigational barriers.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:35.600
It turns out border cells
respond not just to walls.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.490
If you put a rodent
in an environment

00:30:37.490 --> 00:30:39.380
where there's a cliff
they can't go off,

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.950
the border cells also respond
to the edge of that cliff.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.770
OK, so any navigational
barrier basically

00:30:45.770 --> 00:30:47.870
telling you where
you are with respect

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:49.025
to navigational barriers.

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:54.410
OK, all right.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:55.340
Blah, blah, blah.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:00.620
OK, so as I mentioned
in the last lecture

00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.930
when we talked about the
parahippocampal place area,

00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:04.850
the shape of space
around you has

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:09.020
this kind of privileged role
in many aspects of navigation.

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.470
OK, so now we're going to
talk about this problem

00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:16.850
of reorienting or regaining
your sense of direction

00:31:16.850 --> 00:31:19.430
once you've been disoriented.

00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:22.870
And so, again, I
mentioned this before.

00:31:22.870 --> 00:31:25.370
But just to give you in give
you the intuition of what we're

00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:29.090
talking about here, you come
up from the subway in Manhattan

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.360
or any other environment
that's rectilinear

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.880
that you know and you know which
stop you're coming at up at.

00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.960
So you kind of know where
you are, but you come out

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.670
and you don't know
which way to head.

00:31:40.670 --> 00:31:43.460
You don't know
which way is which.

00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:47.027
So that's a modern version of
a classic problem that animals

00:31:47.027 --> 00:31:48.110
face in their environment.

00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:50.540
They may know where they are,
but that doesn't tell them

00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.220
which way they're facing.

00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:54.480
So just to be really
concrete about this,

00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.060
so here's an aerial
view of a person.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.980
You're standing here.

00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.910
You have a cognitive
map in your mind,

00:32:01.910 --> 00:32:06.060
and your place cells are telling
you your location in that map.

00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:10.190
OK, so you know where
you are in that map.

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.630
And you're looking
down a street,

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.580
so you know that you're
oriented with respect

00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:17.450
to some external axis like this.

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:20.720
But you don't know how
your mental maps should

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.530
be aligned with that street.

00:32:22.530 --> 00:32:28.250
Are you facing like this,
facing north in Manhattan,

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:31.160
or are you facing south?

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.650
All right, so that's the
problem of reorientation

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:37.560
is figuring out your particular
orientation, not just

00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:39.180
your location but
which way you're

00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.270
facing in a known environment.

00:32:42.270 --> 00:32:44.610
And we've all faced some
version of this presumably

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:46.798
at some point,
and it's annoying.

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:48.090
It takes a while to figure out.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.340
And then I don't know if
anybody's had this experience.

00:32:50.340 --> 00:32:51.870
I've had it only in
Manhattan because that's

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:53.398
where this arises
for me, but I'm

00:32:53.398 --> 00:32:54.690
sure there are other locations.

00:32:54.690 --> 00:32:57.273
Where you come up and you think
you're going one way, and then

00:32:57.273 --> 00:33:02.012
all of a sudden, it's like your
whole mental map goes kaboom.

00:33:02.012 --> 00:33:03.720
How many people have
had that experience?

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.130
It's very sudden and punctate.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.950
Yeah, it turns out
that when that happens,

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:11.040
all of your neurons
flip together in unison.

00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.390
Like they're all in cahoots.

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.100
They have one version of this.

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.690
When you have that
experience, it's

00:33:15.690 --> 00:33:17.273
because they're all
flipping together,

00:33:17.273 --> 00:33:19.450
and I'll show you some
data on that in a second.

00:33:19.450 --> 00:33:21.690
OK, all right.

00:33:21.690 --> 00:33:24.420
So there's a very
evolutionary old system

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.550
for solving just this problem.

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:28.778
And it's a wonderful little
piece of the literature

00:33:28.778 --> 00:33:30.570
that I'm going to spend
a couple of minutes

00:33:30.570 --> 00:33:34.050
on because it's so
classic and so cool.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:37.680
And this started with work by
Randy Gallistel in the 1980s.

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:40.860
And so what he did was
he studied this problem

00:33:40.860 --> 00:33:44.640
of reorientation-- that is
figuring out your orientation

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:47.700
in a known environment once
you've been disoriented.

00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:51.360
It's a very particular aspect
of the problem of navigation.

00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.270
So he put rats in a
rectangular environment,

00:33:54.270 --> 00:33:56.820
and he had them explore
the environment.

00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:00.357
And then he hid some
rat-relevant thing,

00:34:00.357 --> 00:34:02.190
like a little piece of
food, say a chocolate

00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:03.600
chip in that corner.

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.190
OK, rat sees that happen,
rat is interested.

00:34:06.190 --> 00:34:08.010
Take rat out of
box before they get

00:34:08.010 --> 00:34:12.100
to go take the chocolate chip,
and then you disorient the rat.

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.350
You don't grab them by the
tail and swing them around,

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:16.034
but you do some slower version.

00:34:16.034 --> 00:34:17.159
You want to make them sick.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:18.850
You do some slower
version of that

00:34:18.850 --> 00:34:21.600
so they've lost track of
which way they're facing.

00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.870
OK, now you put
them in a new box--

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.969
new box because you
don't want the smell

00:34:26.969 --> 00:34:32.670
to still be there, new box, and
you see which way the rat goes.

00:34:32.670 --> 00:34:38.253
And you find that the rat goes
50-50 to those two corners.

00:34:38.253 --> 00:34:39.920
What does that mean
the rat has encoded?

00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:46.139
He doesn't go randomly
to any corner.

00:34:46.139 --> 00:34:46.980
He goes to corners--

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:48.105
he knew it was in a corner.

00:34:48.105 --> 00:34:49.800
He doesn't go randomly
to any corner.

00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.360
Yeah, Ben?

00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:52.270
Jack, I'm sorry.

00:34:52.270 --> 00:34:54.270
AUDIENCE: Or you can turn
it around to the left.

00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:55.395
NANCY KANWISHER: Say again.

00:34:55.395 --> 00:34:58.130
AUDIENCE: Like it's specifically
in one of these directions.

00:34:58.130 --> 00:34:59.402
So the left [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:59.402 --> 00:35:01.860
NANCY KANWISHER: You've got to
say a little more than that.

00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:02.940
What's to the left?

00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:05.790
What's different about those
two corners than the other two?

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:06.885
Yeah, Isabel?

00:35:06.885 --> 00:35:09.510
AUDIENCE: Well, if he's looking
at the shape of the room-- i.e.

00:35:09.510 --> 00:35:11.427
these two longer walls
and two shorter walls--

00:35:11.427 --> 00:35:14.220
he recognizes that
the space [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:18.278
he has to go to what looks
like the right [INAUDIBLE]..

00:35:18.278 --> 00:35:19.320
NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.070
He has to have
encoded the axis--

00:35:23.070 --> 00:35:27.900
the fact that the room is
longer on one axis than another.

00:35:27.900 --> 00:35:31.860
And he's essentially encoded
that chocolate chip was

00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.050
on the right side
of the long wall

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:36.818
or the left side of the short
wall, and both of those corners

00:35:36.818 --> 00:35:37.860
are consistent with that.

00:35:37.860 --> 00:35:40.350
That's why he goes
50-50 to them.

00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.658
He can't go 100% of the
time to the right corner

00:35:42.658 --> 00:35:44.700
because he has no information
that would tell him

00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:46.020
that in this experiment.

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.070
OK, everybody clear?

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:50.370
So it tells you he learned
where the thing is with respect

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:54.120
to the shape of the room and
its particular aspect ratio.

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:58.140
OK, so now the plot
thickens, and now

00:35:58.140 --> 00:35:59.920
they repeat the experiment.

00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.420
But this time, they make some
very rat-salient asymmetry

00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.230
over here.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:07.530
You make a color and
a texture, and you

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.850
make other things to make this
wall very saliently different.

00:36:12.850 --> 00:36:15.520
So you would think the rat,
motivated to find the chocolate

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.550
chip, would now go
100% to that corner

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:20.800
when we put them in the new
box with the same landmark

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.570
cue over there.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:27.670
But no, the rat goes 50-50
to the same two corners.

00:36:27.670 --> 00:36:30.837
And in control experiments,
many control conditions,

00:36:30.837 --> 00:36:32.920
you can show-- and I'll
show you one in a moment--

00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.960
the rat absolutely
knows about this wall.

00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:37.900
He's encoded the presence
of that asymmetric wall,

00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.090
so he has the
information that should

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:42.070
enable him to
break the symmetry,

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:45.330
but he doesn't use it.

00:36:45.330 --> 00:36:45.920
That's weird.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.420
You should be surprised.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.957
OK, everybody get
why that's weird?

00:36:49.957 --> 00:36:52.040
He could have solved this
one perfectly this time.

00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:53.180
He has the information.

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:56.120
He's not using that information.

00:36:56.120 --> 00:37:00.260
OK, so that's weird.

00:37:00.260 --> 00:37:02.540
But then Liz Spelke
and her colleagues

00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.060
came along 10 years
later and said,

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.580
let's try this with infants.

00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:09.200
And so they did
the infant version,

00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.460
where you put the infant in
a room with a symmetrical--

00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.670
in a rectangular room, and you
hide the doors so the infant

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:20.015
doesn't have any cues other
than the shape of the room.

00:37:22.910 --> 00:37:26.990
18 to 24-month-old
infants, and then you

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:30.020
hide a toy in a corner, and
you see what the infant does.

00:37:32.235 --> 00:37:33.860
Actually what you do
with the infant is

00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.130
you make this wall really
salient in all kinds of ways.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.680
In one case, it was red
velvet, and they first

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.830
showed the-- and these
are, I guess, toddlers.

00:37:42.830 --> 00:37:45.470
They first show them that when
you knock on the red wall,

00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:46.700
music happens.

00:37:46.700 --> 00:37:49.670
Totally cool, riveting
for a little kid.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:50.580
They totally get it.

00:37:50.580 --> 00:37:52.550
They know all about
the music wall.

00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:54.320
Very salient to them.

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:56.960
Nonetheless, you put
them in this experiment,

00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.700
and they behave
just like rodents.

00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.100
They go 50-50 to
the two corners.

00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.920
Even though they notice
the red music wall,

00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:06.470
and it could have solved the
problem for them perfectly.

00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:07.880
And they were
motivated, but they

00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:09.650
didn't use the information.

00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:12.410
Everybody get why that's
kind of interesting

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:15.560
and kind of surprising?

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.120
OK, now you might say,
OK, rodents, infants,

00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:22.040
they're dummies.

00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.250
We wouldn't do that,
us smart adult humans.

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:27.080
Would we?

00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:30.830
But oh yes you would under
certain circumstances.

00:38:30.830 --> 00:38:33.230
If we tied up your
language system--

00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:35.010
and there's lots of
ways of doing that.

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:37.340
One way is called shadowing.

00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:39.610
So it's like
simultaneous translation

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:40.610
but you don't translate.

00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:41.442
Try this sometime.

00:38:41.442 --> 00:38:43.400
I do this occasionally
when I'm bored in my car

00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:46.460
just because it's amusingly
difficult. Turn on the radio,

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:48.740
listen to somebody talking,
and just repeat everything

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:52.618
they say after they say it.

00:38:52.618 --> 00:38:53.660
I'm not even translating.

00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:54.680
It's still demanding.

00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:57.270
So you have to be
listening and producing.

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:58.250
OK, running thing.

00:38:58.250 --> 00:39:00.350
OK, so that's called
verbal shadowing,

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.870
and it's an established
way to really tie up

00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:05.510
your language system and take
it offline so you can't really

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.740
use it.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.520
When you do this
experiment on human adults,

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.250
if they're verbally shadowing
and their language system

00:39:13.250 --> 00:39:16.580
is tied up, they behave just
like rodents and infants.

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.940
That is they use the
shape of the space,

00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.160
but they don't use salient
landmarks that could

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:23.660
help them solve it perfectly.

00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.990
They go 50-50 to
the two corners.

00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:29.980
They become rats and infants.

00:39:29.980 --> 00:39:32.350
We become rats and infants.

00:39:32.350 --> 00:39:36.640
OK, so Liz Spelke has spun
a whole fascinating big

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:40.577
theoretical story about
what this really means.

00:39:40.577 --> 00:39:42.910
Well, let me just say a little
bit more about this first

00:39:42.910 --> 00:39:44.470
before I do her whole big story.

00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:47.360
OK, yeah so the idea
is-- so first of all,

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:49.990
why would it make sense
for rodents at least--

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:51.280
let's just consider the rats--

00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.550
to use only the shape of
space to reorient themselves

00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:55.870
when they're disoriented?

00:39:55.870 --> 00:39:58.270
At first glance, that
seems really crazy.

00:39:58.270 --> 00:40:01.660
But if you think about rodents
in natural environments,

00:40:01.660 --> 00:40:05.290
the idea is that actually
in natural environments,

00:40:05.290 --> 00:40:06.610
features change.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:07.960
Snow comes and goes.

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.250
Plants come and goes.

00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.650
Odors change.

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:15.190
All those kinds of features
of the environment can change,

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.500
but the shape of
the environment,

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.110
like that there's a slope
like this and a barrier here

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:22.930
and a cliff there, those
are more stable features

00:40:22.930 --> 00:40:24.260
of the environment.

00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.470
So it actually makes
evolutionary sense

00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:31.360
for disoriented rodents at least
to use the shape of space more

00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:34.180
than the features-- the
colors and textures and odors

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:35.260
of a space--

00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.330
as landmarks to
reorient themselves.

00:40:37.330 --> 00:40:38.720
Does that makes sense?

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:44.500
And so the idea is that rodents
have through evolution evolved

00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.450
this system for
reorienting themselves

00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:49.090
when they lose their
bearings that relies only

00:40:49.090 --> 00:40:53.050
on the shape of space so
restrictively that even

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:55.420
if another cube becomes
relevant and important,

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:58.480
they don't use it.

00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:00.040
And the further
idea is that we have

00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.280
some version of this system
in our heads as well.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.260
And as smart adult
humans, we learn

00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:07.930
all kinds of other strategies
to get beyond this.

00:41:07.930 --> 00:41:09.550
We're not trapped
with only being

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.290
able to use this one
system to solve it.

00:41:11.290 --> 00:41:13.180
We can use other systems--

00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:16.000
possibly language to help
us say things to ourselves,

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:19.000
like it's on the left
side of the short wall.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.110
That's what Spelke thinks.

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.693
There is some version
in your head of,

00:41:21.693 --> 00:41:23.440
it's on the left side
of the short wall,

00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:26.410
and that's why adults can
do this when their language

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:27.700
system isn't tied up.

00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.200
I don't think that's
exactly right,

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.230
but it's a beautiful story, and
there's some evidence for it.

00:41:32.230 --> 00:41:36.670
OK, anyway, part of the reason
I go through this whole thing--

00:41:36.670 --> 00:41:38.650
well, one, I think these
experiments are cool,

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:42.460
but it's also been the
basis of a core idea

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:44.650
in cognitive science,
and that idea

00:41:44.650 --> 00:41:47.030
is called informational
encapsulation.

00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:49.030
So think about, it's
just lots of syllables

00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:50.740
for a pretty simple idea.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:53.110
That you have this
system for reorientation,

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:55.180
and it is designed to
use the shape of space

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.270
around you as the cue that
you use to reorient yourself

00:41:58.270 --> 00:41:59.650
when you're disoriented.

00:41:59.650 --> 00:42:03.220
That system is hardwired
to do just that.

00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:05.140
And if some other
part of your brain

00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.360
has information that
could solve the problem,

00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:11.810
like the presence of a relevant
feature that you could use,

00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:12.850
you don't have--

00:42:12.850 --> 00:42:14.830
your re-orientation
system doesn't have access

00:42:14.830 --> 00:42:15.700
to that information.

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.950
It's informationally
encapsulated.

00:42:17.950 --> 00:42:20.680
It only has access to
the particular inputs

00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:23.830
that are hardwired into it.

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:28.240
And so 20 years ago, a lot
of people went wild with this

00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:31.660
and said that all the brain
regions that I've talked about

00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.480
and cognitive systems that
we're considering in this course

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.280
are informationally
encapsulated.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:38.320
It's kind of an
extreme idea that

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.270
goes far beyond
functional specificity

00:42:40.270 --> 00:42:44.290
to say the inputs are extremely
restricted to each region,

00:42:44.290 --> 00:42:46.180
and that's probably not true.

00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:49.330
But there's some limitations
on the information

00:42:49.330 --> 00:42:51.460
that each of these
processors were considering

00:42:51.460 --> 00:42:53.110
in this course has access to.

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:57.220
And this is the classic
evidence, behavioral evidence

00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.827
that some of those systems
have very restricted inputs.

00:42:59.827 --> 00:43:02.410
Does that make sense, the idea
of informational encapsulation?

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:05.090
Not as an absolute
truth about the brain,

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:08.560
but as an idea that is
interesting to consider

00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:11.870
individually for each
of the systems we study.

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:15.020
There's been pushback about
the extremeness of this claim

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:18.265
that infants and rodents
only use the shape of space.

00:43:18.265 --> 00:43:19.640
There are
circumstances where you

00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.680
can get them to use
other information,

00:43:21.680 --> 00:43:23.900
but it's definitely true
that the shape of space

00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.330
is the dominant
cue for reorienting

00:43:26.330 --> 00:43:30.590
in rodents and in infants.

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:34.660
All right, so when you're
lost, as I've mentioned,

00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:36.410
there's two questions
you need to answer--

00:43:36.410 --> 00:43:38.738
where are you and which
way you're oriented.

00:43:38.738 --> 00:43:40.280
This last stuff we
were talking about

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:42.770
is about which way
you're oriented question.

00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.840
OK, and I just showed
you some evidence

00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:47.570
for this general finding
that the geometric cues,

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.870
the shape of space
are the dominant cues

00:43:50.870 --> 00:43:54.290
you use to reorient yourself,
to get your heading back

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:57.320
when you're disoriented.

00:43:57.320 --> 00:44:00.590
But do we really
know that those cues

00:44:00.590 --> 00:44:03.530
are different for
place recognition

00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:05.330
and for heading direction?

00:44:05.330 --> 00:44:07.790
So I've said, here are two
different parts of the problem.

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:10.070
But do they function
differently?

00:44:10.070 --> 00:44:11.930
Do we really use different cues?

00:44:11.930 --> 00:44:14.120
Do we use the
shape of space more

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:17.530
for heading direction and
maybe other cues for place

00:44:17.530 --> 00:44:19.790
recognition, for
knowing where we are?

00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:21.920
OK, so I'm going to
show you a very elegant

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:24.650
behavioral experiment
in mice that does this

00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:27.090
all at once in one experiment.

00:44:27.090 --> 00:44:31.100
So this is Josh Julian, a
former lab tech in my lab.

00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.758
I get no credit for
this whatsoever.

00:44:32.758 --> 00:44:34.550
I'm proud even though
I shouldn't be proud.

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:36.410
He was just an
endogenously smart guy

00:44:36.410 --> 00:44:39.710
who went on and did an awesome
experiment after he left my lab

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:43.250
and went off to grad school, and
here's his awesome experiment.

00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:47.120
OK, so he said, let's get mice
to do both of these tasks.

00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:50.593
They have to know where they are
and which way they're oriented.

00:44:50.593 --> 00:44:52.760
OK, we're going to do the
same disorientation thing.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:55.520
Take them out, turn them around
till they're disoriented.

00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:58.680
But these mice have to learn
two different environments.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:02.000
OK, one environment has
the vertical stripes

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.500
on the short wall, on
one of the short walls.

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.070
The other environment
has horizontal stripes

00:45:07.070 --> 00:45:09.800
on the short wall.

00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:11.360
So you do the same experiment.

00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:14.450
You bait one corner, and you
see where the rodent goes does.

00:45:14.450 --> 00:45:18.710
Does he go to the
two opposite corners?

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:21.920
Exactly the same experiment, but
he has to remember which room

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.720
is-- to solve the
problem, he has to know--

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.750
he has to discover, rediscover
the vertical stripes

00:45:26.750 --> 00:45:29.330
or the horizontal stripes
and act accordingly.

00:45:29.330 --> 00:45:31.610
Because when he's in
the vertical context,

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:34.020
the thing gets hid.

00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:35.510
He does this over
repeated trials.

00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:40.698
The food gets hid on the--

00:45:40.698 --> 00:45:41.990
hang on, let me get this right.

00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:43.660
Long wall on the left.

00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.160
Do, do, do.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:46.610
Yeah, right.

00:45:46.610 --> 00:45:51.860
Yeah, so when the long wall
is on the left of the rodent.

00:45:51.860 --> 00:45:53.850
OK, that corner, the
long wall is on the left.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:54.860
Everybody oriented?

00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:59.750
Whereas when he's in the blue
context, the reward here,

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:01.928
the long wall is on the right.

00:46:01.928 --> 00:46:04.220
OK, so he has to learn those
two different environments

00:46:04.220 --> 00:46:08.120
and that the relevant shape
cues are opposite in each.

00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:09.740
OK, everybody got that?

00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:13.610
OK, now what you find
is that the rodent

00:46:13.610 --> 00:46:15.020
can learn that just fine.

00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:17.840
OK, so this shows that
when you put the rodent

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:21.290
in the vertical context
in a room like this,

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:26.330
they go more to these two
corners than those two corners.

00:46:26.330 --> 00:46:29.840
Whereas when you put him
in a horizontal context

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.420
with horizontal stripes, he
goes more to those two corners

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:34.400
than those two corners.

00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.860
That tells you the
rodent has used

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:39.530
the orientation of the
stripes to figure out

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:41.750
which room he's in
and hence, which

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:44.690
two corners are the right ones.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:46.700
Everybody got that?

00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.110
But here's the amazing thing--

00:46:48.110 --> 00:46:51.020
even though in this experiment,
the very same animals

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:55.160
in the very same trials, are
using those stripes to figure

00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:59.030
out which room they're in, they
don't use those stripes at all

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:02.370
to break the symmetry and to
go only to the correct corner,

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:06.380
which they could do but don't.

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:10.970
So once you've trained the
rodents on these two things

00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:15.660
that the reward is here
in the vertical context

00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:18.680
and they're in the horizontal
context, you disorient them,

00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.745
you put them back in.

00:47:19.745 --> 00:47:21.620
You find that when you
have vertical stripes,

00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:22.950
they go to these two corners--

00:47:22.950 --> 00:47:24.283
I'm just repeating the data.

00:47:24.283 --> 00:47:25.700
When there are
horizontal stripes,

00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:26.908
they go to those two corners.

00:47:26.908 --> 00:47:28.490
OK, they've learned that.

00:47:28.490 --> 00:47:30.710
But why do they go
to those two corners?

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:32.330
They learned the damn stripes.

00:47:32.330 --> 00:47:35.130
They used them to know
which room they're in,

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:37.530
but they don't use them
to break the asymmetry

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:39.155
and decide which is
the correct corner.

00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:44.240
OK, so this is like a
microcosm of everything

00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:46.970
I've been saying so far
all in one experiment.

00:47:46.970 --> 00:47:49.640
The rodents are noticing
those feature cues,

00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:52.100
using them to figure out
which room they're in,

00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.920
where are they,
but failing to use

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.890
those features, the
orientation of the stripes,

00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:01.340
to figure out which of the two
corners is the correct one.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:04.430
They're not even encoding
food is near stripes.

00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:08.220
Like, duh, that
should have been easy.

00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:10.318
All right, so this
is a beautiful--

00:48:10.318 --> 00:48:12.860
I mean, this is more evidence
for informational encapsulation

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:13.610
of this system.

00:48:13.610 --> 00:48:15.703
Because it shows us on
the very same trial,

00:48:15.703 --> 00:48:17.870
they used the stripe
information to know which room.

00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:20.330
They failed to use
it to figure out

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.800
their orientation in that room.

00:48:25.172 --> 00:48:26.380
Is this sort of making sense?

00:48:26.380 --> 00:48:27.630
I realize it's kind of subtle.

00:48:27.630 --> 00:48:31.660
It's sort of simple and
subtle at the same time.

00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:32.465
Yeah?

00:48:32.465 --> 00:48:34.390
AUDIENCE: So with cells
that you showed us

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:37.030
in the very first maps--

00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:38.780
NANCY KANWISHER: What
are they doing here?

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:39.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:40.883
NANCY KANWISHER: Great question.

00:48:40.883 --> 00:48:41.675
Let's look at that.

00:48:41.675 --> 00:48:42.883
That's what we're doing next.

00:48:42.883 --> 00:48:43.810
It's a great question.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:46.180
What are the damn
place cells doing here?

00:48:46.180 --> 00:48:47.972
Great question.

00:48:47.972 --> 00:48:49.930
OK, let's say a little
bit more, and then we'll

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:51.790
think about what the
place cells are doing.

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:56.080
OK, so let me just restate,
cash out the findings here.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:58.930
The mice are using the
features to figure out

00:48:58.930 --> 00:48:59.930
which place they're in.

00:48:59.930 --> 00:49:02.170
Are they in this
one or that one?

00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:06.280
But they are failing to use
those features to figure out

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.510
which is a correct corner.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:09.670
They're still 50-50
for the two corners,

00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:12.280
even though logically they
have that information,

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.780
and they could use it, and
they should use it, they don't.

00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:19.210
So that means the mice
are using features--

00:49:19.210 --> 00:49:22.300
in this case, orientation--
for place recognition,

00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:27.947
but not for regaining their
orientation within that place.

00:49:27.947 --> 00:49:29.530
I'm just repeating
what I said before.

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.000
Is that making sense?

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.410
OK, so now David's question,
what are the place cells

00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:36.190
doing here?

00:49:36.190 --> 00:49:37.210
Great question.

00:49:37.210 --> 00:49:37.960
Let's look.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.990
It's mice, so we can do
that or Keinath et al.

00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:44.050
can do that and Josh Julian,
my amazing former lab tech.

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:47.750
So again, I get no
credit whatsoever.

00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:50.110
So what do they do?

00:49:50.110 --> 00:49:54.790
They allow the mice to forage
for crumbs in a box like this.

00:49:54.790 --> 00:49:59.280
OK, they disorient the
mouse before each trial.

00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.460
Take them out, turn them
around so he doesn't

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.690
know which way he's facing.

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:03.530
Put them in the box.

00:50:06.350 --> 00:50:10.040
And they find that place cells
have a particular location

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.000
in that box.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:11.660
Not surprising.

00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.220
That's what place cells do.

00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:16.460
So here are two
different trials--

00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:18.260
two different cells
that were mapped out

00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:19.505
in a rodent doing this.

00:50:19.505 --> 00:50:23.360
This cell responds
always in that corner.

00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.367
Another cell responds
only in that corner.

00:50:26.367 --> 00:50:27.950
OK, these are just
place cells like we

00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:30.035
described before doing
what place cells do.

00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:40.830
But now, sometimes those place
cells are off by 180 degrees,

00:50:40.830 --> 00:50:44.530
even though the stripes
should resolve the ambiguity.

00:50:44.530 --> 00:50:49.620
OK, so those same
cells on other trials

00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:51.030
respond to the opposite corner.

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:58.960
So the place cells are doing
just what the rodent is doing.

00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.760
The place cells are confused.

00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:03.770
Am I facing--

00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:06.460
I am oriented like this,
or am I oriented like that?

00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:10.660
The place cells don't know,
and the rodent doesn't know.

00:51:10.660 --> 00:51:12.880
And the coolest thing
about this experiment

00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:14.650
is that these things are linked.

00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:17.530
On the trials where the rodent
goes to the wrong corner,

00:51:17.530 --> 00:51:20.920
the place cells are also
in the wrong corner.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.230
OK, they systematically
determine

00:51:23.230 --> 00:51:24.670
which way the animal will go.

00:51:27.610 --> 00:51:30.100
Oh, and also as I mentioned
before, all those cells are

00:51:30.100 --> 00:51:30.640
in cahoots.

00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:33.140
They're all in sync
going the same way.

00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:36.550
So when one of the cells
rotates to the opposite corner,

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:39.910
all the other ones rotate
to the opposite corner.

00:51:39.910 --> 00:51:43.150
So it's as though somehow
on trial to trial,

00:51:43.150 --> 00:51:45.970
the rodent thinks he's
oriented in one way,

00:51:45.970 --> 00:51:48.320
he's actually 50-50
which way he's oriented.

00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:51.970
He's not using the feature
cues, and his behavior

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:55.240
according to where he looks
for the food exactly follows

00:51:55.240 --> 00:51:59.170
that way he's oriented and
so do all of his place cells.

00:51:59.170 --> 00:52:01.690
OK, that's that whole
system goes together.

00:52:01.690 --> 00:52:04.870
That tells you that those
place cells are relevant

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:05.590
behaviorally.

00:52:05.590 --> 00:52:07.930
They are the system
that either directly

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:10.150
determines or is tightly
linked to the system that

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:14.770
determines which way the
animal thinks he's facing.

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:18.670
OK, I realize this is a
little bit complicated.

00:52:18.670 --> 00:52:21.820
Does it make sense to you that
as we've been talking about

00:52:21.820 --> 00:52:24.820
with reorientation, even
though the animals should know

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.430
from this stripe the
difference between that corner

00:52:27.430 --> 00:52:29.770
in this corner, he
doesn't know behaviorally.

00:52:29.770 --> 00:52:32.500
He's looking for food right
there, and yet he goes 50-50.

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.510
Weird and stupid, right?

00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:37.550
Place cells do the same thing.

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:41.860
And further, the place cells
and the behavior go together.

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:42.427
Yeah, Sasha?

00:52:42.427 --> 00:52:45.010
AUDIENCE: So if you're reading
information off of place cells,

00:52:45.010 --> 00:52:46.360
can you zap it?

00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:48.400
Can you [INAUDIBLE]?

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.660
NANCY KANWISHER:
Wouldn't that be nice?

00:52:50.660 --> 00:52:53.590
Turns out you can't for the
reason someone over here

00:52:53.590 --> 00:52:54.940
asked a long time ago.

00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:57.890
You, I think.

00:52:57.890 --> 00:53:00.168
And that's because they're
all interleaved together.

00:53:00.168 --> 00:53:02.710
And if you zap just one, you're
not going to have-- one cell,

00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:03.860
you're not going
to have an effect.

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.943
And if you zap a whole
region, you get all of them

00:53:05.943 --> 00:53:07.130
and you get muck.

00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:09.670
So you can't do that
manipulation unfortunately.

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:14.950
You need some kind of topography
to do the manipulation.

00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:16.825
OK, so I just said
how all this--

00:53:16.825 --> 00:53:19.930
I got ahead of myself--
how it relates to behavior,

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:21.530
but just to go
through that quickly.

00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:23.110
So what we've done
here is they've

00:53:23.110 --> 00:53:25.750
trained the mouse on this
classic reorientation task.

00:53:25.750 --> 00:53:28.360
They disorient the mouse before
each trial while recording

00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:30.340
from hippocampal place cells.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:34.780
As before, given cell flips 180
degrees from trial to trial,

00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:36.550
despite the fact
that the stripes

00:53:36.550 --> 00:53:39.820
should disambiguate it and tell
them which way he's oriented.

00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:42.280
And by the way, head direction
cells and the grid cells

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:47.410
also flip in the same way in
cahoots with the place cells.

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:49.870
But you can tell which
corner the animal

00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:54.850
will go to by looking at
what the place cells respond.

00:53:54.850 --> 00:54:00.730
And so when this place cell
represents that location,

00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:02.560
the animal searches first there.

00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:06.430
And when it flips around, they
search in the opposite corner.

00:54:06.430 --> 00:54:09.013
OK, so all of that just
shows this really strong link

00:54:09.013 --> 00:54:10.555
between the place
cells and behavior.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.750
So to recap, we've talked
about four different kinds

00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:20.170
of cells involved in
representing space

00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:22.030
and navigating around in it.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.220
Place cells that are
like the "you are here,"

00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:26.680
they respond when you're
in a particular location.

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:28.330
Direction cells
that respond when

00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:32.080
you're heading in one direction,
not in another direction.

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.290
Border cells that
fire when you're

00:54:35.290 --> 00:54:37.450
near a particular border
in the environment.

00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:39.010
I have border cells
going right now

00:54:39.010 --> 00:54:40.260
throughout this whole lecture.

00:54:40.260 --> 00:54:43.240
I've got a batch of border
cells that are going.

00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:47.080
Grid cells that do this
amazing thing of firing when

00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:49.270
the animal is in multiple
different locations,

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:51.160
and those locations
that make it fire

00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.810
are arranged in
a hexagonal grid.

00:54:53.810 --> 00:54:56.020
Think of it as a kind of
ruler telling the rodent

00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.240
how far he's gone in this
space, and those grid cells

00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.073
are like the rulers.

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.810
Yeah, right.

00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:07.810
Those are the four kind
we've talked about.

00:55:07.810 --> 00:55:10.390
So now, here's the cool thing.

00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:13.090
All this stuff--
navigation is awesome.

00:55:13.090 --> 00:55:16.180
We need it, it's important.

00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.480
All mobile animals
need it for the reasons

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.560
we've been talking about.

00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:24.280
But we can use this whole
system for so much more

00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.400
than just navigation.

00:55:25.400 --> 00:55:27.580
Once you have this fancy
system in your head

00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.650
to keep track of your
location, to keep track

00:55:29.650 --> 00:55:32.308
of your direction, to keep
track of where things are,

00:55:32.308 --> 00:55:33.850
how you're moving
through that space,

00:55:33.850 --> 00:55:35.980
you can use that whole
magnificent system

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:37.150
in other ways.

00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:38.950
And in the last
three or four years,

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:41.200
there's just a huge number
of studies that are really

00:55:41.200 --> 00:55:43.180
starting to take
this very seriously,

00:55:43.180 --> 00:55:45.430
particularly the grid
cells and thinking

00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:47.223
about how the grid cells--

00:55:47.223 --> 00:55:48.640
I mean, probably
the whole system,

00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:50.348
but people have been
focusing on the grid

00:55:50.348 --> 00:55:55.220
cells and how they're used in
multiple different situations.

00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:56.830
So here's one.

00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:59.590
OK, this is a cool study
where what these guys did was

00:55:59.590 --> 00:56:01.690
they stuck a little device
hanging around people's

00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:02.860
necks, the subjects' necks.

00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:04.720
Have a little camera
aiming forward.

00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:07.180
It takes pictures
at random intervals

00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.940
and records the
person's GPS location.

00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:12.265
OK, so you send them
off for a few months

00:56:12.265 --> 00:56:14.140
with this little device,
and you do something

00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:15.340
to protect people's privacy.

00:56:15.340 --> 00:56:17.173
I don't know exactly
how they maneuver that,

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:18.817
but I'm sure they found a way.

00:56:18.817 --> 00:56:20.650
And so then they get
this set of photographs

00:56:20.650 --> 00:56:24.340
taken from this person's front
view of wherever they were

00:56:24.340 --> 00:56:26.380
over several months
as they went wherever

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:29.380
they went in their
lives with a little GPS

00:56:29.380 --> 00:56:31.090
tag for each photograph.

00:56:31.090 --> 00:56:34.210
OK, so then what they do is
they bring the subjects in

00:56:34.210 --> 00:56:35.710
and pop them in the
scanner and show

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:36.877
them some of those pictures.

00:56:40.380 --> 00:56:43.110
And they asked people
to relive the experience

00:56:43.110 --> 00:56:46.830
that they had when they
were looking at that thing.

00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:49.560
Put this on me, it'd be my
monitor like all the time,

00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:52.290
and I wouldn't know which
experience to relive,

00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:56.730
but I guess these people
had richer lives let's hope.

00:56:56.730 --> 00:57:00.720
OK, so now what they do is
they use multiple Voxel pattern

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:05.490
analysis in the hippocampus
while people are reliving

00:57:05.490 --> 00:57:07.860
those experiences in
the scanner by looking

00:57:07.860 --> 00:57:10.545
at those images taken from
their front facing cameras.

00:57:13.170 --> 00:57:15.970
And then they asked, is
the pattern of response

00:57:15.970 --> 00:57:18.095
in the hippocampus, like
some bunch of voxels, here

00:57:18.095 --> 00:57:20.730
is some pattern,
is it more similar

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:26.100
for events the subject remembers
that were nearby in space?

00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:29.130
OK, so you do this for me,
it's like yes, I occasionally

00:57:29.130 --> 00:57:32.280
go to the Stata cafeteria,
and I occasionally

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:37.055
go to the Koch Center cafeteria,
and I spent a lot of time

00:57:37.055 --> 00:57:38.430
at home, and those
two things are

00:57:38.430 --> 00:57:40.140
closer to each other
than my home thing.

00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:43.050
Are the patterns more
similar for nearby locations

00:57:43.050 --> 00:57:47.160
than for more distant locations?

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.480
And they were.

00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:54.390
So this is the distance on a log
scale between two patterns that

00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:56.850
result from the subject looking
at two different images,

00:57:56.850 --> 00:58:02.380
and this is the similarity of
the pattern in the hippocampus.

00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:04.320
Now some of you
might be wondering,

00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:05.747
and in fact, I wonder this too.

00:58:05.747 --> 00:58:07.830
I think this is a cool
study so I'm presenting it,

00:58:07.830 --> 00:58:10.080
but it doesn't make sense
to me because everything

00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:12.870
we know about the hippocampus
is those place cells

00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:14.580
are pretty interleaved.

00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:18.780
So how you manage to get a
pattern response reading out

00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:22.440
a systematic location out of the
hippocampus is a mystery to me.

00:58:22.440 --> 00:58:26.100
So they can't be fully-- there
must be some kind of structure

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:29.490
in there to the
layout of those cells

00:58:29.490 --> 00:58:31.380
to enable them to
get this information.

00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:33.750
OK, does everybody get
how it's telling you

00:58:33.750 --> 00:58:39.690
that the hippocampus is
remembering and reliving

00:58:39.690 --> 00:58:42.030
some representation
of the locations

00:58:42.030 --> 00:58:45.210
of where you had
those experiences?

00:58:45.210 --> 00:58:47.220
Everybody get how this shows us?

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.320
But then they asked another
interesting question,

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.727
and they said, oh, does
it also represent time?

00:58:52.727 --> 00:58:54.810
So we've been talking about
space for the last two

00:58:54.810 --> 00:58:57.143
lectures, but now we're going
straight off the deep end.

00:58:57.143 --> 00:58:59.520
And our first step, not
even near the deep end

00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:03.217
yet is, does it do not
just space but time?

00:59:03.217 --> 00:59:04.800
So they can take all
those photographs

00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:06.870
and say, OK, how
far apart in time

00:59:06.870 --> 00:59:09.060
were these two
photographs taken?

00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.640
And they can do the same
graph, and yes, they

00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.500
get a relationship
with time as well.

00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:17.350
The farther apart in time
people saw those two patterns,

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:20.910
the more different the
patterns in the hippocampus.

00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:22.770
Isn't that cool?

00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:26.520
OK, so that's one
example showing

00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:30.510
that the hippocampus holds
some kind of large scale

00:59:30.510 --> 00:59:34.600
representation of not
just space but also time.

00:59:34.600 --> 00:59:37.830
And so there's a lot of work
on how this gives structures

00:59:37.830 --> 00:59:42.240
to our memories for distances
over the range of 100 meters

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:45.267
and times between 15
hours and a month.

00:59:45.267 --> 00:59:47.100
I'm going to run out
of time, so unless it's

00:59:47.100 --> 00:59:49.500
a clarification question,
I'm going to keep going.

00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:50.030
Yeah, OK.

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:51.750
AUDIENCE: Are different
states confounded for time?

00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:52.860
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, yes.

00:59:52.860 --> 00:59:55.277
If you just did it like that--
so you have to do something

00:59:55.277 --> 00:59:58.290
to pick out time things that
aren't confounded with space.

00:59:58.290 --> 00:59:59.902
You have this big
sample of pictures,

00:59:59.902 --> 01:00:01.860
and you take a subset
where you balance for it.

01:00:01.860 --> 01:00:02.580
Absolutely.

01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:04.170
They would have to do that.

01:00:04.170 --> 01:00:08.400
I can't actually remember,
but they must have done that.

01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.158
Imperfect as peer
review is, you'd never

01:00:10.158 --> 01:00:11.700
get through peer
review if you didn't

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.130
take care of that problem.

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:16.240
OK, so that's the first thing.

01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.890
Here's another even
more radical example.

01:00:19.890 --> 01:00:23.280
So people have shown that
grid-like representations--

01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:24.990
and I'm skipping over
most of the details

01:00:24.990 --> 01:00:27.240
here to give you the gist
because actually the details

01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:29.460
are a bit complicated.

01:00:29.460 --> 01:00:32.550
But they've shown that people
seem to use their grid cell

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:38.070
system when they are thinking
about conceptual spaces, not

01:00:38.070 --> 01:00:39.840
just physical spaces.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:42.930
OK, so there's one
classic experiment

01:00:42.930 --> 01:00:46.470
in which these guys taught
subjects a conceptual space.

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:49.830
They taught them about
different kinds of birds,

01:00:49.830 --> 01:00:52.320
and these birds differed
on two dimensions.

01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:55.920
They could vary in neck
length or in leg length.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:57.840
And these things were
orthogonal varied,

01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.550
so they made some
artificial birds

01:00:59.550 --> 01:01:02.130
that filled up that space.

01:01:02.130 --> 01:01:03.660
And so here are
some of the birds.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:06.390
This one has short
legs, and OK, here's

01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:08.280
one with short legs
and a long neck.

01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.210
And here's one with a
longer neck and shorter--

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:12.930
wait, let's see.

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:15.240
Longer legs and shorter
neck right there.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:18.000
OK, so you've got every
possible combination.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.220
They didn't show people
a space like that.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:24.540
They just taught them things
about these different birds.

01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.880
They had to remember their names
and various facts about them.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:30.840
And so the idea is that when
people learn about those birds,

01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:34.170
they mentally
construct a 2D space.

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:36.330
Because, in fact,
those birds were

01:01:36.330 --> 01:01:39.210
generated from a 2D
space, varying neck length

01:01:39.210 --> 01:01:40.155
and leg length.

01:01:42.770 --> 01:01:45.710
And so then when
they scan subjects,

01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:50.030
they found essentially
a neural signature

01:01:50.030 --> 01:01:54.870
of a grid system
representing that 2D space.

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:57.620
So even though the
grid system presumably

01:01:57.620 --> 01:02:00.950
evolved to enable us to
navigate around in a 2D space

01:02:00.950 --> 01:02:04.100
and keep track of where
we are in that 2D space,

01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.830
it seems like it's now
getting co-opted and being

01:02:06.830 --> 01:02:10.290
used for all kinds of
representations of 2D spaces,

01:02:10.290 --> 01:02:14.990
including extremely abstract,
artificial learned 2D spaces

01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:17.635
that you weren't even taught
explicitly as a 2D space.

01:02:17.635 --> 01:02:19.010
You were just
taught these birds.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:24.720
So that's pretty amazing.

01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:30.090
In another recent study, they
had subjects do a role-playing

01:02:30.090 --> 01:02:32.298
game while in the scanner.

01:02:32.298 --> 01:02:33.840
And in the role-playing
game, they're

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:36.210
interacting with
virtual characters.

01:02:36.210 --> 01:02:40.440
And those virtual characters
had different kinds

01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:42.930
of social power and
different affiliations

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:44.950
with other individuals.

01:02:44.950 --> 01:02:49.530
So here's another--
the social space

01:02:49.530 --> 01:02:53.070
that was invented by
the experimenters,

01:02:53.070 --> 01:02:55.530
and the subjects are
playing this game,

01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:57.600
interacting with other
virtual individuals

01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:04.680
who vary in social dominance
and their affiliation to others.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.100
And they find
place cell activity

01:03:08.100 --> 01:03:13.080
that seems to echo the
position of another person

01:03:13.080 --> 01:03:14.820
in that social space.

01:03:14.820 --> 01:03:16.860
I mean, that's
extremely abstract.

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:20.370
And yet again, parts of the
navigation spatial system

01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:22.278
are being co-opted to do this.

01:03:22.278 --> 01:03:24.570
I'm not giving you the details
on how all this is done.

01:03:24.570 --> 01:03:26.465
I'm just telling
you that studies

01:03:26.465 --> 01:03:27.840
have shown that
these systems are

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:30.930
being co-opted for other uses.

01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:34.980
Here's another very charming
non-spatial use-- well,

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:37.050
sort of spatial use--

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:38.260
of place cells.

01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:42.300
So those bats, turns out, are
extremely social organisms.

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.307
They have very sophisticated
social structures,

01:03:44.307 --> 01:03:46.890
and they care a lot about each
other and who's related to whom

01:03:46.890 --> 01:03:49.110
and who's doing what to whom.

01:03:49.110 --> 01:03:53.490
And it turns out that there
are social place cells in bats.

01:03:53.490 --> 01:03:56.220
That is, cells in
this bat's brain,

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:59.580
if I were a bat, that would
be representing your location,

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.170
Jack.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:03.930
OK, so not the usual thing
where my place cells are just

01:04:03.930 --> 01:04:06.090
saying where am I.
I'm watching you,

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:09.750
and my place cells are
telling me, where are you.

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:13.260
Something social organisms care
a lot about, including bats.

01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:17.790
So they have an observer bat
here hanging upside down,

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:20.820
and he's watching this bat
fly over to there and back.

01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:23.370
And then in this
experiment, he subsequently

01:04:23.370 --> 01:04:24.540
flies that same path.

01:04:24.540 --> 01:04:27.180
That's how we know that he's
watching that path because he

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:30.510
has to mimic the bat's
path that he just observed.

01:04:30.510 --> 01:04:36.780
But while he's watching that bat
fly on that path, what you see

01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:38.410
is here's a cell right here.

01:04:38.410 --> 01:04:44.250
Here is the path flown by
the bat, like out and back.

01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:48.190
And this is when the bat is
flying out and back himself,

01:04:48.190 --> 01:04:51.180
and this is when the other
bat is flying out and back.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.540
That blurred a little bit.

01:04:52.540 --> 01:04:56.170
Here's the place field for self
and the place field for other.

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:57.150
They're not the same.

01:04:57.150 --> 01:04:59.850
A given cell doesn't
represent the same location

01:04:59.850 --> 01:05:01.230
when it's me who's
there and when

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:05.400
it's the person or bat
I'm watching who's there.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:07.290
But they're place
fields in both cases.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:12.615
Social place cells.

01:05:12.615 --> 01:05:14.490
I'm going to keep going
because otherwise I'm

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:17.910
going to run out of time,
but I'll hang around after.

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:23.880
OK, so this whole
system is used not just

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:27.690
for representing social status.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:31.950
What kind of bird this is
in this abstract bird space,

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:35.200
but actually for making
decisions, for thinking.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:40.613
OK, so as rats run in
mazes, you can record--

01:05:40.613 --> 01:05:42.030
we've shown this
already-- you can

01:05:42.030 --> 01:05:45.090
show multiple
hippocampal place cells.

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:47.340
And can you guys imagine
that if we were recording

01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.230
from several different
hippocampal cells

01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:51.960
at the same time, we
could read out those cells

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.570
and make a guess about where
the rat is in its location.

01:05:54.570 --> 01:05:57.660
It's just like MVPA but
done across neurons.

01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:01.620
So we have a pretty good
sense of where the rat is.

01:06:01.620 --> 01:06:05.640
So now we have a rat
navigating around in this maze,

01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:07.650
and what I'm going to
show you, the white circle

01:06:07.650 --> 01:06:09.990
is where the rat actually is.

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:12.300
And the little color
thing is telling you

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.090
where the simultaneous
readout from several place

01:06:15.090 --> 01:06:19.715
cells in that rat's hippocampus
would predict where the rat is.

01:06:19.715 --> 01:06:21.090
Like can we tell
where the rat is

01:06:21.090 --> 01:06:22.677
by looking at its place cells?

01:06:22.677 --> 01:06:24.510
OK, so right here they're
in the same place.

01:06:24.510 --> 01:06:25.135
It makes sense.

01:06:25.135 --> 01:06:27.300
The rat is right there,
and we're reading it out.

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.530
OK, so far so good.

01:06:29.530 --> 01:06:33.120
But now what we're going to do
is watch what that place cell

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:36.840
location does as the rat moves
around in his environment

01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.655
and makes decisions
about where to go next.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:44.330
OK, so what we're
going to see is the rat

01:06:44.330 --> 01:06:47.690
is going to come up to an
intersection of the maze--

01:06:47.690 --> 01:06:49.033
I think it's right here.

01:06:49.033 --> 01:06:51.200
And he's going to decide,
am I going to go this way?

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.760
Am I going to go that way?

01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.880
And as the rat stays there
deciding which way to go

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:59.030
and the white stays there as
he sits there thinking, huh,

01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:00.420
should I do this?

01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.580
Should I do that?

01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.980
You could call it
neural deliberation.

01:07:03.980 --> 01:07:09.470
We will see what his place
cell activity shows you.

01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:11.720
So here we go.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:16.730
Rat starts there-- whoops,
how do I play this here?

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:19.370
OK, so rat is heading up there,
and so are his place cells.

01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:21.290
He comes up to the intersection.

01:07:21.290 --> 01:07:24.380
He stays in one place, but look
what his place cells are doing.

01:07:24.380 --> 01:07:26.570
Should I go over there?

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:28.400
I'm just interpreting
what this means,

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:32.150
but it sure looks like
neural deliberation to me.

01:07:32.150 --> 01:07:33.380
And that's what he decided.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.350
Everybody get what we just saw?

01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:38.300
While he's standing
there, he's in one place,

01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:40.670
but he's clearly deciding
where to go next.

01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:43.220
And while he's deciding,
those place cells

01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:46.430
are essentially apparently
running simulations

01:07:46.430 --> 01:07:49.920
of where he might go next.

01:07:49.920 --> 01:07:52.680
OK, so we started with this
big long list of things

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.260
you need to know to navigate
around in the world.

01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.440
And the neural basis of all this
is really not understood yet,

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:01.800
but I've shown you what I think
are a bunch of tantalizing

01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:03.360
snippets.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:06.180
Which lead to the idea
that our best current guess

01:08:06.180 --> 01:08:08.770
about the neural
locus of these things,

01:08:08.770 --> 01:08:11.250
which is very far from the
actual understanding of how

01:08:11.250 --> 01:08:14.220
they work, is that
the perception

01:08:14.220 --> 01:08:15.960
of the layout of
space around us,

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:20.250
the PPA and the occipital place
area are very involved in that.

01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:24.160
Also in saying for an unfamiliar
place what kind of place

01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:24.660
is this.

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.785
I didn't show you those
data, but you can, in fact,

01:08:26.785 --> 01:08:29.340
decode whether you're
looking at a scene or a beach

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:33.180
by looking at the pattern
of response and the PPA.

01:08:33.180 --> 01:08:36.210
We talked about the idea
that the retrosplenial cortex

01:08:36.210 --> 01:08:38.819
may be involved in recognizing
familiar locations-- that's

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:41.609
a bit of a question mark.

01:08:41.609 --> 01:08:44.010
That the idea that
your map of the world

01:08:44.010 --> 01:08:45.720
is represented in
your hippocampus

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.670
by way of place
cells, which also say

01:08:47.670 --> 01:08:49.710
where you are in that world.

01:08:49.710 --> 01:08:51.417
That your heading
direction in humans--

01:08:51.417 --> 01:08:53.250
I didn't give you all
the evidence for this,

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:55.167
but in humans, there's
quite a bit of evidence

01:08:55.167 --> 01:08:56.935
that retrosplenial
cortex is very involved

01:08:56.935 --> 01:08:57.810
in heading direction.

01:08:57.810 --> 01:08:59.727
I guess I did give you
evidence-- patients who

01:08:59.727 --> 01:09:03.420
have had damage there and can
recognize places but not know

01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:05.310
how they're oriented there.

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:08.580
That planning routes around
boundaries in your environment

01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:10.470
involves the
occipital place area

01:09:10.470 --> 01:09:12.720
and the parahippocampal
place area

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.060
and that this business
of reorientation

01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:18.479
seems to particularly
involve heading

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:23.220
direction cells in humans, most
likely in retrosplenial cortex.

01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:24.899
So you don't need
to memorize all.

01:09:24.899 --> 01:09:27.149
I mean, I don't care that
much about the locations.

01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:28.566
What I want you
guys to understand

01:09:28.566 --> 01:09:31.067
is what are these problems
that are involved in navigation

01:09:31.067 --> 01:09:32.609
and what kinds of
things can we learn

01:09:32.609 --> 01:09:35.178
with different kinds of
behavioral and neural measures.

01:09:35.178 --> 01:09:37.470
And you may have noticed in
the last couple of lectures

01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:39.540
that I presented lots
of behavioral data,

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:41.939
because actually
so far, the richest

01:09:41.939 --> 01:09:44.790
insights about how the system
actually works still come--

01:09:44.790 --> 01:09:48.240
or many of the rich ones
come from behavioral data.

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.620
OK, quiz is in two minutes.

01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:53.114
Does anybody want to ask me
a question before the quiz?

01:09:57.530 --> 01:09:58.107
Yeah?

01:09:58.107 --> 01:09:59.940
AUDIENCE: Do you know
that the [INAUDIBLE]??

01:10:03.170 --> 01:10:05.870
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, so you
have to do lots of controls

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:07.190
to work that out.

01:10:07.190 --> 01:10:10.773
And I didn't show you any
of the details of the data.

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:12.440
But yeah, these guys
are pretty careful,

01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:15.170
and there are all these things--
there are many different ways

01:10:15.170 --> 01:10:21.080
in which people are
watching hippocampal neurons

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:24.770
and decoding trajectories
from hippocampal neurons.

01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:27.020
You may have heard
about replay, which is

01:10:27.020 --> 01:10:28.780
a big thing in this department.

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:30.770
Tonegawa and Wilson
labs study this,

01:10:30.770 --> 01:10:35.450
where you have a rodent moving
around in one trajectory

01:10:35.450 --> 01:10:36.950
during the day,
and then you record

01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:38.450
from those neurons
at night, and you

01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:41.270
see replay of the trajectories
that the rodent went through

01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:42.540
in the previous day.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:44.962
And so there you have to be
really careful to say, OK,

01:10:44.962 --> 01:10:46.670
there's a lot of data
and a lot of noise,

01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:48.295
and is this really
more than the noise?

01:10:48.295 --> 01:10:52.050
And it is, but it takes a lot of
statistical work to show that.

01:10:52.050 --> 01:10:52.880
Yeah?

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] scenario
be like a place that I know.

01:10:57.930 --> 01:11:01.080
With the neurons,
the same neurons

01:11:01.080 --> 01:11:03.930
would fire if I go back to
that environment, I assume,

01:11:03.930 --> 01:11:05.100
or like the place?

01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.343
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, yep.

01:11:08.343 --> 01:11:10.260
AUDIENCE: But then you
can't really have that,

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:12.750
or you can't reserve neurons
for those [INAUDIBLE]..

01:11:12.750 --> 01:11:13.470
NANCY KANWISHER:
It's a good question.

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:14.910
How do we have enough neurons?

01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:17.430
Yeah, especially for some
place we go every six months.

01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:19.763
Are they sitting around waiting
for us to go back there?

01:11:19.763 --> 01:11:22.500
No, there's some recycling of
neurons across very different

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.440
locations.

01:11:23.440 --> 01:11:25.890
So within that location,
they'll be consistent.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:27.390
But yes, you do recycle.

01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:30.300
So the same neuron will have one
place cell in this environment,

01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:31.980
and it may or may
not have a place

01:11:31.980 --> 01:11:33.330
cell in another environment.

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:35.270
That's a good question.

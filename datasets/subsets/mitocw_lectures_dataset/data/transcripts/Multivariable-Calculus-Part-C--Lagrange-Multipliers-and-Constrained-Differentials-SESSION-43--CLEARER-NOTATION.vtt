DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.098
So today, the problem
I'd like to work with you

00:00:11.098 --> 00:00:13.620
is about taking
partial derivatives

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.120
in the presence of constraints.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.160
So this is a pretty
subtle business.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.440
So take your time when
you work these problems.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.860
So what we have is we
have this function w,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:30.990
and it's a function of four
variables: x, y, z, and t.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.490
OK?

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.230
But it's not really a function
of these four variables

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.890
because we have a constraint.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.630
So we want to
study how w changes

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:46.190
as we vary the parameters,
except that we have imposed

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.260
this constraint here.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.820
So that really we kind of
only have three variables,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.960
because we have four
variables and one constraint.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.630
So that's what partial
derivatives with constraints

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.240
help us do.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.260
So let's explain
first the notation.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.810
OK?

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:07.260
So it says partial w
partial z, and then we

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.790
have the subscripts x and y.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.520
So what's important
about this notation

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.480
is not what you see as
much as what you don't see.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.950
What you don't see
is the variable t.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.660
OK?

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.260
So what this notation
means is, as always,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.990
the denominator in our
derivative expression--

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.045
partial z here-- that means
that we want to vary z.

00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:30.620
And we want to see how
w changes as we vary z.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.810
And the x and y here mean that
we want to keep x and y fixed.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.690
So if we didn't
have a constraint,

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.754
this x and y here
would be superfluous.

00:01:40.754 --> 00:01:42.420
Because by partial
derivative, we always

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.510
mean to keep the other
unlisted variables unchanged.

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.065
However, the fact that
t is missing here,

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:54.660
it means that-- so if you
think about it-- if we vary z,

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.570
and we keep x and y fixed,
then t also is varying.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.070
Right?

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.690
Because we have this
constraint here.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.190
And so it wouldn't
make sense for me

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.920
to ask you to compute the
partial derivative of w

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.789
in z varying x, y, and t
because-- excuse me-- keeping

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.330
x, y, and t fixed,
because then there

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.880
would be no room for z to vary.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.380
OK?

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.200
So this notation means that z
is going to be allowed to vary,

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.170
but it's going to vary
in a way that we're just

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.840
going to ignore.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780
So you will see how this
works out in the problem.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.196
So what we're
really interested in

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:30.810
is making sure that x and y
stay fixed and that z varies.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.540
And then we're going to need
to-- when we do some algebra,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.414
we're going to need to
get rid of any mention

00:02:35.414 --> 00:02:37.250
of the variable t.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.930
OK.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.300
So the first way that we're
going to work this out

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.930
is using total differentials.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.680
And I like to use
total differentials

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.220
when I'm on new ground
because-- they're not

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.320
the most computationally
effective,

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.900
because they involve computing
all the derivatives that we

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.900
might possibly need in sight.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.750
So they're not the most
efficient computationally.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:04.200
But if you go ahead and compute
the total differentials,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.800
then all the other
computations that you have

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.260
to do are just substitution.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.020
So it really just
becomes linear algebra,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.100
and that's what I like about it.

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.760
In part b, we'll see a shortcut
using implicit differentiation

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.340
and the chain rule.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.810
And this is going to
be a little bit tricky.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.540
So we have these
two equations, we

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.480
need to turn them both into
differential equations.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.430
And so we'll do that
using a combination

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.300
of implicit differentiation
and the chain rule.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.830
So I'll let you pause
the video and get

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:37.130
started on these problems.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.630
And you can check back and
we'll work it out together.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.990
OK, welcome back.

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.260
So let's start by doing a,
let's start with problem a.

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.666
So we have total differentials
is the suggested way

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:01.290
to attack this.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.880
So why don't we
just start computing

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:04.630
the total differentials
that we know.

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.590
So we have two equations.

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.150
w in relation to the other
variables and the constraint

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:10.830
equation.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.110
And what we first
want to do is just

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.360
take the total differential
of both of those equations

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.080
to get started.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:22.270
So we can take the first one
and it tells us that dw is equal

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:37.410
to-- OK, so we have 3 x
squared y dx, plus x cubed dy,

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:51.820
minus 2z*t dz,
minus z squared dt.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:52.790
OK.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.280
Now right away, we can
simplify this equation.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:57.830
So this is the
total differential,

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.500
but we have to remember
that in the setting we're

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.280
interested in, x and
y are held fixed.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.970
And so holding x and y fixed
means that the differentials dx

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.070
and dy are both set to 0.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.760
So that lets us rewrite this
first differential equation is

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:29.342
just dw equals minus 2z*t
dz minus z squared dt.

00:05:29.342 --> 00:05:31.050
So that's our first
equation that we get.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.925
Let me just check with
my notes to make sure.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:41.510
That's right.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.330
OK.

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.599
And so now, we have
the constraint equation

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:47.390
from the original
statement of the problem.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.931
And we need to take
its differential.

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:58.530
So on the one hand,
we get x dy plus y dx.

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:01.940
That's the total differential
of the left-hand side.

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:11.110
And then on the right-hand
side, we have t dz plus z dt.

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.750
OK?

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:15.510
And now we notice that now the
left-hand side of this equation

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.910
is just 0 for the same reason.

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.100
dy and dx are being held fixed.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.570
So the relation that
we end up getting

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:37.370
is we get that dt is equal
to minus t over z dz by just

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.830
doing straightforward algebra.

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.710
OK.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:47.639
So, with that in
hand now, we can-- so

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:49.180
remember I mentioned
in the beginning

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.450
that our goal was-- so
from the very beginning,

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:55.330
we knew that if we varied z,
because of our constraint,

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:57.950
we're going to be
forced to be varying t.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:07:00.557
And that's exactly what this
equation says, doesn't it?

00:07:00.557 --> 00:07:03.140
We got this by just taking the
differential of the constraint.

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:05.720
And it says if you
vary z, you have

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.970
to vary t in an
appropriate way, and that's

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.340
what this coefficient tells us.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.760
So what we're
really interested in

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.460
is how does w vary
in terms of z here.

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.010
And so we want to get
rid of this dt here.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.060
And in fact, we can by
using the constraint.

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:32.350
So combining this equation
with this equation,

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:42.370
we get that dw here
is equal to-- OK,

00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:48.085
so we have minus 2z*t dz.

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:55.850
And then we have minus-- OK--
z squared times another minus

00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:04.000
times t over z, so this
all becomes a plus z*t dz.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.250
So all I did is I plugged in
for dt using our formula here.

00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:18.840
And so this altogether is
equal to just minus z*t dz.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.920
And that tells us that the
partial derivative that we're

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:31.520
after is just this
coefficient, right?

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.030
The partial derivative
is just defined

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:35.920
to be the coefficient
of the differential

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.220
once you work everything out.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.300
And so this is minus z*t.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.350
OK, so that's a.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:52.825
So now let's see if we can
use some tricks to make

00:08:52.825 --> 00:08:54.075
the computation a bit shorter.

00:08:54.075 --> 00:08:55.616
So the tricks that
we're going to use

00:08:55.616 --> 00:08:58.880
are implicit differentiation
and the chain rule.

00:09:09.067 --> 00:09:10.650
So at the end of the
day-- excuse me--

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.330
we're interested in
partial w partial z.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.529
And what we're going to
do is use the chain rule

00:09:18.529 --> 00:09:20.570
to just take a straightforward
partial derivative

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:22.590
of our original expression.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:27.450
So remember, w was x
cubed y minus z t squared.

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.800
And so let's just take
a partial derivative

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.015
of that in the z-direction.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:37.870
So the partial derivative in
the z-direction of x cubed y

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:38.450
is just 0.

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:39.830
So that will go away.

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:48.210
And so we only have minus--
we have a 2z*t component.

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:52.820
That's just because the partial
derivative of z squared is 2z.

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:57.880
And then we have another term
which is minus z squared,

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:00.829
and now we need to take
the partial derivative of t

00:10:00.829 --> 00:10:01.620
in the z-direction.

00:10:07.782 --> 00:10:14.420
So, you know, often times when
we take partial derivatives

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:26.350
of one variable in
terms of the other,

00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:28.922
it's common to think that
the partial derivative of one

00:10:28.922 --> 00:10:30.630
variable in terms of
the other is just 0.

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.604
Because usually our
variables are independent.

00:10:32.604 --> 00:10:34.270
They don't vary in
terms of one another.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.950
But this is exactly
a situation where

00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:39.800
t does vary depending on z,
and so we had to include that

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.450
into our notation.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.460
OK.

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:45.460
So now this is
almost what we want,

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:47.252
except we have this
mystery component here.

00:10:47.252 --> 00:10:48.709
And of course,
there's only one way

00:10:48.709 --> 00:10:51.370
we can solve this mystery, which
is the same way we solved it

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:52.100
in part a.

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:53.349
We have to use the constraint.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:04.220
So let's take partial z of
our constraint equation.

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:08.672
And remember, our constraint
equation was x*y equals z*t.

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.880
OK.

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.780
So if we take the partial
derivative of this equation--

00:11:18.780 --> 00:11:21.740
so if I take the partial
derivative of x and y

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:27.750
in terms of z, then I do
get 0, because x and y are

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:31.790
genuinely independent from z.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.230
It's only t that depends on z.

00:11:34.230 --> 00:11:37.080
So on this side we get 0.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:40.370
Now, on the other side I just
need to use the product rule.

00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:55.590
So I get t, plus z
partial t partial z.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.730
OK?

00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:09.590
So we can rewrite this as saying
that partial t partial z is

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.790
minus t over z.

00:12:15.090 --> 00:12:15.670
OK?

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:18.640
Now, you might notice that,
you know, this is formally

00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:21.600
very similar to what we did
in part a, and of course,

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.290
that's no surprise.

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:27.740
When we are manipulating
using implicit differentiation

00:12:27.740 --> 00:12:30.365
and the chain rule,
it's just a compact way

00:12:30.365 --> 00:12:32.740
of doing what we were doing
with the total differentials.

00:12:32.740 --> 00:12:37.620
I mean, to me, the chain
rule is a computation

00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:41.130
which you could prove by
doing the corresponding thing

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.720
with total differentials.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.920
And so we get this same
coefficient negative t over z,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.880
which you recall that
we got in part a.

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:51.390
OK.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:59.790
So now we have, once again
we have this, two equations,

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:01.880
and we just can do substitution.

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:15.592
So we get that partial w partial
z is equal to minus 2z*t.

00:13:15.592 --> 00:13:20.670
And now again, we get
minus another minus,

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:26.490
and z here cancels the z
squared, so we get plus z*t.

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.400
And so we get minus z*t.

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.380
OK, and finally, if we
remember our assumptions,

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.390
our assumptions were that x
and y were independent of z.

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:41.810
That was our notation.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:45.070
And we use that assumption
at this step right here.

00:13:45.070 --> 00:13:47.870
So in fact, we don't just have
the partial derivative of w

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:49.780
with respect to z.

00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:54.140
We need to specify that
we held x and y fixed.

00:13:54.140 --> 00:13:56.150
OK.

00:13:56.150 --> 00:13:59.480
So just to review
again, if we look now

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:06.180
at what we did in part b, you
know, the meat of the argument

00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.880
was the exact same as
what we did in part a.

00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:11.300
The meat of the
argument was right here.

00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.420
We took some derivative and
then this was an unknown.

00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.550
The definition of
w doesn't know how

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.800
t and z depend on one another.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.230
That you can only find by
looking at the constraint.

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:24.980
And so we just went
through the problem

00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:29.010
and we took derivatives
of the constraint,

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.520
and that gave us an equation
that we were looking for.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:39.140
Now if we go back now
to part a over here.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:49.462
So as you can see, there's a lot
more work involved in part a.

00:14:49.462 --> 00:14:51.670
On the other hand, to me it
was more straightforward.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.980
We just had to compute
the total differentials

00:14:54.980 --> 00:14:58.630
and then do some linear
algebra with cancellations.

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.557
And somehow, when you
do total differentials,

00:15:00.557 --> 00:15:02.890
you just compute everything
that could possibly come up,

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.860
and then you just
substitute it in.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.560
And indeed, we got
the same answer:

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.690
partial w partial z
as being minus z*t.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:14.615
OK, and I think I'll stop there.

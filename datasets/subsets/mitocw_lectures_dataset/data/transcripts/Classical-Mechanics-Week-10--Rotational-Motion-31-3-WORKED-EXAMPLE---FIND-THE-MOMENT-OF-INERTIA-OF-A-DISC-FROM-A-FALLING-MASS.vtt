00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.660
Let's determine the moment
of inertia of a big wheel.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.040
Here we have a big wheel and
on the side it's attached here

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.270
at the center .

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.160
And there's a string going
around here, and on that string

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.030
is a little mass hanging.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:29.370
And our disk here
has a radius R.

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:35.550
And we now want to in
a little experiment

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.580
what the moment of
inertia is of this disk.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.090
And what we have
to do is we have

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.240
to drop this mass to
the ground, and we

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.400
need to measure
what height is here,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.220
and we need to measure
how long it takes to drop.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.840
So we need to measure t.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.520
So how are we going
to go about that?

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.230
Well the moment of
inertia, that probably

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.870
has something to do with
the torque of this wheel.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.830
So we have to start
doing a torque analysis.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.660
So torque about the center of
mass equals moment of inertia

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:18.820
about the center of mass times
the angular acceleration.

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.350
And we need to recall
that the torque is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.610
the product of the radius
times the perpendicular force,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.760
so we're going to
have R here, and then

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.789
the force that's
acting on this wheel

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.320
here is actually this
tension force here.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.670
So we are going to
have our RT here.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.289
And now we need to look at
how things actually moving

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.509
with respect to
coordinate system.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.270
So if I let this mass
drop, to the disk

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.890
it's going to spin clockwise.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.620
So we're going to have
theta hat going this way.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.230
And if theta hat
is going clockwise,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.690
my k hat vector is going
to go into the board.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.570
And if k hat is
going to go there,

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.820
and it's rotating clockwise,
the angular acceleration

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.600
is going to go in
the k hat direction.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.650
And if that is the
case, then the torque

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.530
is going to follow suit.

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:31.410
So torque also goes
into the board.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.150
And so that means
here we're going

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.410
to deal with k hat direction.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.690
And we're going to
have Icm and then

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.420
alpha Z in the k hat direction.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:51.390
OK, so we can solve this
I RT over alpha Z. OK,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.760
well that's pretty good, but
we have two unknowns-- the T

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.140
and the alpha Z. And we can use
some other concepts to actually

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.920
get information on those.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.700
The T, as you can guess
already, plays a role here

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.440
in this massless string, so
we can do a quick free body

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:22.530
diagram, an F equals ma analysis
to get to that tension force.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:28.380
So we have a little mass, m,
here gravity is acting on it.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.360
And we have this
tension force here.

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.140
And we're going
to put j hat down.

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.560
So we're going to get
mg minus t, equals ma.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.079
It's only going to
go in y direction,

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.600
so we can just leave it here.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.960
And we can solve this for t.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:57.020
And then we have mg minus a.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.190
OK, good, so we have that.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.190
Now about the
angular acceleration.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:06.900
And whenever there was a string
going around a disk then,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.210
we of course, have a
constrained condition,

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:18.660
because the linear acceleration
of this little mass going down

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.050
is related to the radius of
the disk, times the angular

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.010
acceleration.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.740
So we can solve this for alpha.

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:36.700
And then we have a over R.
So let's put that in here.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.250
R, and then we have
mg minus a over a,

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.540
and then we get another R here.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.070
And we can write that a little
bit more compact, mR squared g

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.380
over a minus 1.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:04.140
Good, so now we have one last
hurdle, namely that a here.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.290
That a we can't measure.

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:11.250
I said in the beginning, we
want to make an experiment.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.540
Actually we need experiment,
because we can't otherwise

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.610
get to this a, so
what we need is

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:23.640
a relation that connects what we
can measure, which is the time.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.490
It falls down the height here to
the acceleration of this block.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:35.370
And of course, that comes from
one dimensional kinematics.

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:48.030
And we know that h equals 1/2 at
squared, so we can solve for a.

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:53.320
2h over t squared.

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.560
And now we can
stick that in here.

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:08.660
And we have mR squared, gt
squared over 2h minus 1.

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.530
And let's just write
this here again.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:15.220
And that is our final solution.

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.380
So now we have only
measurable quantities here.

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:21.390
The t we can measure.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:24.410
We just need a stopwatch.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.500
And the h we can
measure, as well.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:32.640
And this actually
already resembles,

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:37.590
if you know the
theoretical, this already

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.830
resembles the
theoretical solution,

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.540
which of course is for a disk.

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:52.110
1/2 mR squared, so that's
what one expects for a disk.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.230
And you see that we're very
close, so this term here

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:58.500
is probably something
like 1.5, or should better

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:01.570
come out to be 1.5,
because if we subtract 1,

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:03.540
we get to that 1/2 here.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.720
And you can use it to
in return-- in return,

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.390
you can also use it
to predict the time

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.265
it takes to fall down if
you know what the height is

00:07:13.265 --> 00:07:15.363
or vice versa.

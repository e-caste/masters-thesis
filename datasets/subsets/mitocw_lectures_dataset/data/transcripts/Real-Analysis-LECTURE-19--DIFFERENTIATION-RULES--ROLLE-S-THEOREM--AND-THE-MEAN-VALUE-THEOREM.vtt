00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.560 align:middle line:84%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: So let's
continue with our discussion

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.520 align:middle line:90%
of the derivative.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:24.040 align:middle line:90%


00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.970 align:middle line:84%
Let me recall that the
derivative of a function, if it

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.790 align:middle line:84%
exists, which we denote
by f prime of c, this

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.530 align:middle line:84%
is the limit as x
goes to c of f of x

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.260 align:middle line:90%
minus f of c over x minus c.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.500 align:middle line:84%
Last time, we looked at the
relationship between continuity

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.290 align:middle line:84%
and differentiability and showed
that differentiability implies

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.340 align:middle line:84%
continuity, but that
having a derivative

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:03.880 align:middle line:90%
is quite a miraculous thing.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.920 align:middle line:84%
Because there are
continuous functions,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.050 align:middle line:90%
which we actually constructed.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.910 align:middle line:84%
We constructed a
continuous function.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.500 align:middle line:90%
You can generalize that example.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.010 align:middle line:90%


00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.070 align:middle line:84%
So we constructed a
continuous function

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.230 align:middle line:90%
that is differentiable nowhere.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.440 align:middle line:84%
So in fact, differentiability
is a much stronger condition

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.370 align:middle line:90%
than continuity.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.885 align:middle line:90%
And it's something of a miracle.

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:34.200 align:middle line:90%


00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.200 align:middle line:84%
Just as a side note, if you go
on to study complex analysis,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.170 align:middle line:84%
which are functions
of a complex variable

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.940 align:middle line:84%
rather than of a real
variable, you also

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.990 align:middle line:84%
have the notion of
a derivative there.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.500 align:middle line:84%
And then, the derivative
is much more miraculous

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.460 align:middle line:84%
than it is here in
the setting of r.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.200 align:middle line:84%
But the whole point
is, the derivative

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.050 align:middle line:90%
is something of a miracle.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.130 align:middle line:84%
So today, the goal is
to prove some properties

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.150 align:middle line:90%
about the derivatives.

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.792 align:middle line:90%
Most of these you know.

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:08.500 align:middle line:84%
Maybe you didn't cover
the proofs of them

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.500 align:middle line:84%
in calculus with the ultimate
goal of proving the mean value

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.080 align:middle line:84%
theorem, which
is, to me probably

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.440 align:middle line:84%
the most underappreciated
but most important

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.610 align:middle line:90%
result in calculus.

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.200 align:middle line:84%
Now, you could
argue that probably

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.925 align:middle line:84%
the hero of the
story of calculus

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:35.800 align:middle line:84%
is the fundamental
theorem of calculus, which

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.140 align:middle line:84%
connects integration,
which we'll cover next

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.980 align:middle line:90%
after differentiation.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.310 align:middle line:84%
Which so the fundamental
theorem of calculus

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.320 align:middle line:84%
connects integration
and differentiation.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.720 align:middle line:90%
So that really is, but--

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.850 align:middle line:84%
and that is really
the hero of calculus.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.220 align:middle line:84%
It gets used more
than anything else.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.890 align:middle line:84%
But to prove that, you use
the mean value theorem.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:06.093 align:middle line:84%
So if the fundamental theorem
of calculus was Batman,

00:03:06.093 --> 00:03:07.510 align:middle line:84%
I would say the
mean value theorem

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.460 align:middle line:90%
is something like Alfred.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.730 align:middle line:84%
He's really the reason why
Batman gets to be who he is.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.060 align:middle line:90%


00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.170 align:middle line:90%
Enough analogies for now.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.100 align:middle line:84%
Let's go back to proving some
properties of the derivative.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:30.902 align:middle line:90%
So first, let's do some basic--

00:03:30.902 --> 00:03:35.310 align:middle line:84%
the basic linearity and
rules for the derivative.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:43.505 align:middle line:84%
So let f go from I to R.
i is always some interval.

00:03:43.505 --> 00:03:53.310 align:middle line:90%


00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.990 align:middle line:84%
And if f-- so I have
two functions, f and g,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:00.382 align:middle line:90%
from I to R. c is a point in i.

00:04:00.382 --> 00:04:03.350 align:middle line:90%


00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:17.200 align:middle line:84%
And the conclusion is, if f
and g are differentiable at c,

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.570 align:middle line:84%
then we have several
rules that we can apply.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:31.730 align:middle line:84%
The first is basically the
linearity of the derivative

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:38.870 align:middle line:84%
that for all alpha and
R, function alpha f plus

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:49.910 align:middle line:84%
g, which now goes from I to
R, is differentiable at c.

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.520 align:middle line:90%


00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.040 align:middle line:84%
And the derivative of the
function alpha f plus g

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.520 align:middle line:84%
prime c is alpha times f
prime of c plus g prime of c.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.575 align:middle line:90%


00:05:09.575 --> 00:05:14.340 align:middle line:84%
I think I'm starting to write
a little slandered here.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:24.300 align:middle line:84%
Second is the multiplication
rule, which is the function

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:34.460 align:middle line:84%
f times g is
differentiable at c.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:41.030 align:middle line:84%
And the derivative
of the product

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.920 align:middle line:84%
is not the product
of the derivatives,

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:50.270 align:middle line:84%
but the prime of c, g of c
plus f of c, g prime of c.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.160 align:middle line:90%


00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.740 align:middle line:90%
So that's a multiplication rule.

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.020 align:middle line:84%
And then, we also have
the quotient rule.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:10.130 align:middle line:90%


00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.040 align:middle line:84%
And just like when you need
to divide by something,

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:17.270 align:middle line:84%
you need to assume that
you're never dividing by 0.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:24.560 align:middle line:84%
If g of x does not
equal 0 for all x in I,

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:40.710 align:middle line:84%
then the function f over
g is differentiable at c.

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:48.910 align:middle line:84%
And the derivative
is the derivative

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.950 align:middle line:84%
of the top times the
bottom minus the top

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.210 align:middle line:84%
times the derivative of
the bottom over the bottom

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:04.450 align:middle line:84%
squared, [? now ?]
prime g of c squared.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.380 align:middle line:90%


00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.480 align:middle line:90%
So I'll prove one and two.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.030 align:middle line:84%
Three we'll leave
as an exercise.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:27.550 align:middle line:90%


00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:33.700 align:middle line:84%
So for one, we just
compute that the limit

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:45.070 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to c of alpha f plus g
of x, minus alpha f plus g of c

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:53.040 align:middle line:84%
over x minus c, this is just
by definition alpha times

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.990 align:middle line:84%
f of x plus g of x minus alpha
times f of c plus g of c.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.790 align:middle line:84%
And so, this equals the
limit as x goes to c.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:07.020 align:middle line:84%
And just collecting
terms alpha times alpha

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:15.480 align:middle line:84%
f of x minus f of c times
x minus c, plus g of x

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.280 align:middle line:90%
minus g of c over x minus c.

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:27.790 align:middle line:90%
And all of these limits exist.

00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:29.230 align:middle line:90%
So this is just a fixed number.

00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:33.100 align:middle line:84%
The limit as x goes to c of
this exists and this exists.

00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:36.419 align:middle line:84%
So by what we know
about limits, namely

00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:40.929 align:middle line:84%
that the limit of the sum
is the sum of the limits.

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.090 align:middle line:84%
And then, scalars just
pull out of the limit.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:49.900 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to alpha times f
prime of c plus g prime of c.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:52.750 align:middle line:84%
So that's the proof
of the first one.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.590 align:middle line:84%
For the proof of the
second one, we'll

00:08:56.590 --> 00:09:00.490 align:middle line:84%
use the fact that
a function which

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:06.110 align:middle line:84%
is differentiable at a point
is also continuous at a point.

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:21.880 align:middle line:84%
So since g is differentiable
at c, it is continuous at c.

00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.350 align:middle line:90%
I.e.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:29.350 align:middle line:84%
limit as x goes to c of
g of x equals g of c.

00:09:29.350 --> 00:09:32.650 align:middle line:90%


00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:34.930 align:middle line:84%
Now we compute the
limit as x goes

00:09:34.930 --> 00:09:42.310 align:middle line:84%
to c of f times g
of x minus f of c

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:45.700 align:middle line:90%
times g of c over x minus c.

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:49.330 align:middle line:90%


00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.120 align:middle line:84%
Now what I'm going to
do is add and subtract

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.790 align:middle line:90%
f of c times g of x.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:57.340 align:middle line:84%
So this I can write
as the limit as x

00:09:57.340 --> 00:10:06.070 align:middle line:84%
goes to c of f of x, minus f of
c over x minus c, times g of x.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:10.380 align:middle line:90%


00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:22.640 align:middle line:84%
Plus now, f of c times g of x
minus g of c over x minus c.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.230 align:middle line:90%


00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:30.250 align:middle line:84%
And again, so this limit
as x goes to c exists.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.090 align:middle line:84%
This is just the
derivative of f at c.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:36.655 align:middle line:84%
And we noted that since
g is differentiable at c,

00:10:36.655 --> 00:10:39.130 align:middle line:84%
g is also continuous
at c, meaning the limit

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:42.280 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to c of g
of x equals g of c.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.900 align:middle line:90%
This is just a constant f of c.

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.610 align:middle line:90%
This goes to g prime of c.

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:48.610 align:middle line:90%
So all these limits exist.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:50.410 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
get that this is

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:59.500 align:middle line:84%
equal to f prime of c times g
of c plus f of c, g prime of c.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.540 align:middle line:84%
And three, I'll
leave as an exercise.

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.450 align:middle line:90%


00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:07.220 align:middle line:90%
Again, you'll write out--

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.220 align:middle line:90%


00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:12.110 align:middle line:84%
you'll add and
subtract something

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.550 align:middle line:84%
to f of x over g of x
minus f of c over g of c

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:20.090 align:middle line:84%
and use the fact that
differentiability at a point

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:22.970 align:middle line:84%
implies continuity, and
just evaluate the limits.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:26.030 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to stop
with these two rules.

00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:32.412 align:middle line:90%


00:11:32.412 --> 00:11:34.620 align:middle line:84%
I don't know why I called
it the multiplication rule.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.230 align:middle line:90%
It's called the product rule--

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:39.020 align:middle line:84%
well, multiplication and
product are the same thing.

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:45.560 align:middle line:90%


00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.800 align:middle line:84%
But we also have the
chain rule, which

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:54.340 align:middle line:84%
requires a little more care
to prove than what we've

00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.310 align:middle line:90%
done so far for these rules.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:03.550 align:middle line:90%
So suppose I have two intervals.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:09.730 align:middle line:90%


00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:15.130 align:middle line:84%
And then I have a function
g going from I1 to I2,

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:25.740 align:middle line:84%
f going from I2 to
R. And suppose g

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:39.160 align:middle line:84%
is differentiable at c, and f
is differentiable at g of c.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.850 align:middle line:90%


00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:58.800 align:middle line:84%
Then the function f of g,
function goes from I1 to R.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.850 align:middle line:90%
This is differentiable at c.

00:13:02.850 --> 00:13:16.330 align:middle line:84%
And the derivative
equals f prime of g of c

00:13:16.330 --> 00:13:19.030 align:middle line:90%
times g prime of c.

00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:38.270 align:middle line:90%


00:13:38.270 --> 00:13:51.170 align:middle line:90%
So what's the basic idea?

00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:58.310 align:middle line:84%
Again, so this is basic idea
is that we write the difference

00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:11.530 align:middle line:84%
quotient, g of x minus f of g of
c over x minus c as f of g of x

00:14:11.530 --> 00:14:19.460 align:middle line:84%
minus g, f at g
of c times over g

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:31.080 align:middle line:84%
of x minus g of c times g of
x over g of c times x minus c.

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:35.190 align:middle line:84%
And let x go to c,
and then we'll pick up

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:37.200 align:middle line:90%
the derivative of g here at c.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:41.970 align:middle line:84%
And right here, this is f of
something converging to g of c.

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:45.150 align:middle line:84%
And so, this should be
like f prime of g of c.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.120 align:middle line:84%
But the only problem with
really writing this down

00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:51.720 align:middle line:84%
is that there could be points
where g of x equals g of c.

00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.040 align:middle line:90%
And then, I'm dividing by 0.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.210 align:middle line:90%
That's not allowed.

00:14:54.210 --> 00:14:59.310 align:middle line:84%
So writing this
expression is meaningless.

00:14:59.310 --> 00:15:02.250 align:middle line:84%
But we're going to do
something like this in spirit,

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:06.360 align:middle line:84%
where at least when g of
x does not equal g of c,

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.430 align:middle line:84%
this thing kind of
equals this thing.

00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.690 align:middle line:90%


00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:14.945 align:middle line:90%
That's the basic idea.

00:15:14.945 --> 00:15:19.640 align:middle line:90%


00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:27.420 align:middle line:84%
So to implement
this strategy, let's

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.810 align:middle line:84%
introduce some notation and
a few auxiliary functions.

00:15:31.810 --> 00:15:38.760 align:middle line:84%
So first off, the function
we're interested in taking

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.040 align:middle line:84%
the derivative f of g,
let me call that h of x.

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:47.610 align:middle line:84%
Because I don't want to have
to keep writing f of g of x.

00:15:47.610 --> 00:15:48.720 align:middle line:90%
Let's call it d.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.340 align:middle line:90%
This will be the point g of c.

00:15:52.340 --> 00:16:02.610 align:middle line:84%
So we want to show
then that h prime of c

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:08.460 align:middle line:84%
exists, and it's equal to f
prime of d times g prime of c.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:12.180 align:middle line:90%


00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.970 align:middle line:84%
Just in this
notation I've set up.

00:16:14.970 --> 00:16:23.600 align:middle line:84%
So now, let me define some
auxiliary functions u of y.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:29.030 align:middle line:84%
This is going to be essentially
the difference quotient of f,

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:30.920 align:middle line:90%
except at a certain point.

00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:35.990 align:middle line:84%
So this is f of y
minus f of d over y

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:42.390 align:middle line:84%
minus d when y does not equal
d so that this is meaningful.

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:47.690 align:middle line:84%
And then, f prime of
d when y equals d.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:50.840 align:middle line:90%
And then, v of x--

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:55.580 align:middle line:84%
so this is going to play the
role of that first expression

00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.070 align:middle line:84%
I wrote up there, f of g
of x minus f of g of c.

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:01.790 align:middle line:90%


00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:04.760 align:middle line:84%
And then, v of x,
this will be g of x

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:12.170 align:middle line:84%
minus g of c, x minus c
when x does not equal c,

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:16.460 align:middle line:84%
and g prime of c
when x equals c.

00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.670 align:middle line:90%


00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:33.000 align:middle line:84%
Now, essentially
what do we have here?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.740 align:middle line:90%


00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:42.030 align:middle line:84%
Then if I look at f
of y minus f of d,

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:49.020 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to u of y
times y minus d, always.

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:53.640 align:middle line:84%
Because if y does not equal
d, then I divide over,

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.240 align:middle line:84%
and I get u of y,
then I get f of y

00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:59.790 align:middle line:84%
minus f of d on the left-hand
side over y minus d.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:02.440 align:middle line:84%
And that's equal to
u of y by definition.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And then, when y equals d, I get
0 here, and I get 0 over here.

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:09.060 align:middle line:90%
So that's clear.

00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.910 align:middle line:84%
And also, the same here,
g of x minus g of c

00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:19.590 align:middle line:84%
equals v of x minus
[INAUDIBLE] times x minus c.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:27.840 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.075 align:middle line:84%
So we have these
two expressions.

00:18:32.075 --> 00:18:33.450 align:middle line:84%
And one more thing
I want to note

00:18:33.450 --> 00:18:36.570 align:middle line:84%
is that u and v are
continuous at y equals

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:39.690 align:middle line:90%
d and x equals c respectively.

00:18:39.690 --> 00:18:42.280 align:middle line:90%


00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:53.230 align:middle line:84%
So note that v of y
is continuous at d,

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:59.050 align:middle line:90%
and v of x is continuous at c.

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at
the proof of that.

00:19:01.810 --> 00:19:06.330 align:middle line:84%
We just need to show that the
limit as y goes to d of v of y

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:07.710 align:middle line:90%
equals v of d.

00:19:07.710 --> 00:19:12.480 align:middle line:84%
So compute the limit as
y goes to d of v of y.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.740 align:middle line:84%
Now, when we look
at limits, remember,

00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.590 align:middle line:84%
we're not allowed
to put y equals

00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:23.280 align:middle line:84%
d in the expression
for this limit.

00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.000 align:middle line:84%
We're always looking at points
y close to d but not equal to d,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.810 align:middle line:90%
is what I'm saying.

00:19:28.810 --> 00:19:32.670 align:middle line:84%
And so, therefore, when y is
near d, and not equal to d,

00:19:32.670 --> 00:19:35.910 align:middle line:90%
v of y is given by--

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.081 align:middle line:90%
I should-- this should--

00:19:37.081 --> 00:19:40.240 align:middle line:90%


00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:42.110 align:middle line:84%
I should have written
u here, sorry, u.

00:19:42.110 --> 00:19:44.970 align:middle line:90%


00:19:44.970 --> 00:19:50.250 align:middle line:84%
So we're looking at y near
d, but not equal to d.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:53.220 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it's
given by this expression.

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.590 align:middle line:84%
So this is the
limit as y goes to d

00:19:55.590 --> 00:20:00.420 align:middle line:84%
of f of y minus f
of d over y minus d.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:05.820 align:middle line:84%
And this is just the definition
of the derivative of f at d.

00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:07.290 align:middle line:90%
So remember, d is g of c.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:08.970 align:middle line:90%
So f is differentiable there.

00:20:08.970 --> 00:20:14.340 align:middle line:84%
And this is by
definition u of d.

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:20.790 align:middle line:84%
So this function u is
continuous at y equals d.

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:30.540 align:middle line:84%
And similarly, the limit as
x goes to c of u of x, v of x

00:20:30.540 --> 00:20:37.940 align:middle line:84%
equals v of c, which
is g prime of c.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:41.000 align:middle line:90%


00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:46.250 align:middle line:84%
So now we're going to combine
what I've written here

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:48.110 align:middle line:90%
to finish the proof.

00:20:48.110 --> 00:21:00.560 align:middle line:84%
So in h of x minus
h of c, this is

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:08.620 align:middle line:84%
equal to f of g of
x minus f of g of c.

00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:20.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is equal to u of g of
x times g of x minus g of c.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:24.650 align:middle line:90%
This is from this relation here.

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:31.940 align:middle line:84%
So we'll call this one
star, this one double star.

00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.705 align:middle line:90%
This is by star.

00:21:32.705 --> 00:21:37.180 align:middle line:90%


00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:45.640 align:middle line:84%
And now, I use the second
relation, double star,

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:55.330 align:middle line:84%
to write g of x minus g of c
equals v of x times x minus c.

00:21:55.330 --> 00:22:00.030 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the
limit as x goes

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:11.960 align:middle line:84%
to c of h of x minus h
of c, or x minus c, this

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.130 align:middle line:84%
is equal to the
limit as x goes to c

00:22:16.130 --> 00:22:21.350 align:middle line:90%
of u of g of x times v of x.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:28.700 align:middle line:84%
Now, u is continuous at g
of c, g is continuous at c.

00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:30.620 align:middle line:84%
And we proved that
the composition

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.680 align:middle line:84%
of two continuous
functions is continuous.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:41.720 align:middle line:90%
So this equals u of g of c.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.850 align:middle line:84%
And v of x, we've
proven already.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.060 align:middle line:90%
That limit is v of c.

00:22:47.060 --> 00:22:51.020 align:middle line:84%
And u of g of c, so
this is d, remember,

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.940 align:middle line:90%
in the notation we had earlier.

00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:59.400 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that
equals f prime of g of c.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:06.910 align:middle line:84%
Remember, g of c was
d, times g prime of c.

00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:12.300 align:middle line:90%


00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:14.680 align:middle line:84%
So to go from this
point to this point,

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.920 align:middle line:84%
we use the fact that
u is continuous at c,

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.020 align:middle line:90%
which we proved.

00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.320 align:middle line:84%
u is continuous at g of c,
which we proved over there.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.633 align:middle line:90%
And that g is continuous at c.

00:23:27.633 --> 00:23:30.050 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the composition
of two continuous functions

00:23:30.050 --> 00:23:35.572 align:middle line:84%
is continuous at that point
to arrive at this guy.

00:23:35.572 --> 00:23:37.030 align:middle line:84%
But again, the
whole basic idea was

00:23:37.030 --> 00:23:38.560 align:middle line:84%
to be able to write
the difference

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:44.290 align:middle line:84%
quotient as a product of what
looks like the difference

00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:48.050 align:middle line:84%
quotient of f times the
difference quotient of g.

00:23:48.050 --> 00:23:51.050 align:middle line:84%
But you have to be
careful, because g of x

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:53.210 align:middle line:84%
could equal g of
c, in which case

00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:57.240 align:middle line:84%
you're dividing by 0 in this
basic idea we had up there,

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.940 align:middle line:90%
which is not allowed.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:04.670 align:middle line:84%
But you get around it by
using these functions which

00:24:04.670 --> 00:24:08.270 align:middle line:84%
equal what you want as long
as you're not dividing by 0,

00:24:08.270 --> 00:24:09.020 align:middle line:90%
basically.

00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:14.990 align:middle line:90%


00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:21.411 align:middle line:84%
So that wraps it up for basic
properties of the derivative.

00:24:21.411 --> 00:24:24.120 align:middle line:90%


00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:32.960 align:middle line:84%
And now, we're going to
move on to trying to prove

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.040 align:middle line:90%
the mean value theorem--

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:45.990 align:middle line:90%


00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:48.855 align:middle line:90%
the Alfred of this Batman tale.

00:24:48.855 --> 00:24:54.780 align:middle line:90%


00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:56.880 align:middle line:84%
But first, in order
to prove this,

00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:01.420 align:middle line:84%
we'll need a result about
the derivative in relation

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.680 align:middle line:84%
to certain relative minimum
and relative maximum.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.125 align:middle line:84%
So let me first define
what this means.

00:25:08.125 --> 00:25:13.360 align:middle line:90%


00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:20.750 align:middle line:84%
Let S be a subset of R, f
be a function from S to R.

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:35.700 align:middle line:84%
We say f has a
relative max at c in S.

00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:40.490 align:middle line:84%
If there exists
a delta positive,

00:25:40.490 --> 00:25:47.550 align:middle line:84%
such that for all x in S, x
minus c is less than delta,

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:50.570 align:middle line:84%
then f of x is less
than or equal to f of c.

00:25:50.570 --> 00:25:54.260 align:middle line:90%


00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:56.870 align:middle line:84%
So the picture
here, and then let

00:25:56.870 --> 00:26:12.420 align:middle line:84%
me state that there's
analogous definition

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:17.880 align:middle line:90%
of relative min at c.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:19.500 align:middle line:84%
You just take this
entire definition

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.560 align:middle line:90%
and flip the inequality.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:24.210 align:middle line:84%
That's the definition
for relative min.

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:27.660 align:middle line:84%
So what this means
pictorially, so remember,

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.600 align:middle line:84%
we had this notion of
absolute min and absolute max.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:36.480 align:middle line:84%
An absolute max at a point
c means at every other point

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:39.750 align:middle line:90%
in S, f of x lies below f of c.

00:26:39.750 --> 00:26:45.390 align:middle line:84%
Here we're just saying, as long
as you're close to the point c,

00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:47.450 align:middle line:90%
then you lay below f of c.

00:26:47.450 --> 00:27:05.430 align:middle line:84%
So let's say our function
looks something like that.

00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:08.900 align:middle line:90%


00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:21.040 align:middle line:84%
So then, let's say we're
at this point here.

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:28.360 align:middle line:84%
So this would be absolute
max, because the graph

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:34.600 align:middle line:84%
of the function sits below
the value of the function

00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:39.160 align:middle line:84%
at this point for all x
in this interval a, b.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:46.720 align:middle line:84%
And then, here at this point,
we would have an absolute min,

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.630 align:middle line:90%
because the rest of--

00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.820 align:middle line:84%
because the graph
of the function

00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:58.050 align:middle line:84%
sits above that point for
all x in this interval.

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:06.090 align:middle line:84%
But now, if I go
to this point, say,

00:28:06.090 --> 00:28:12.320 align:middle line:84%
this would be a relative
max, because why?

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:18.290 align:middle line:84%
If I look at an interval--
small interval around it,

00:28:18.290 --> 00:28:20.120 align:middle line:84%
and I look inside
this interval--

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.200 align:middle line:84%
there's too many
dashed lines going on.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.080 align:middle line:90%
So I'm going to erase this.

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:32.310 align:middle line:90%


00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:34.530 align:middle line:84%
Yeah, I'm just going to
do away with the dash.

00:28:34.530 --> 00:28:37.500 align:middle line:84%
If I zoom in on just this
one piece of the graph,

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:44.260 align:middle line:84%
then at this point,
the graph sits

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:55.000 align:middle line:84%
below this point inside
this little vertical strip.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.520 align:middle line:84%
So this guy would
be a relative max.

00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:00.550 align:middle line:84%
And then similarly,
at this point here,

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:01.690 align:middle line:90%
maybe it's-- let me--

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:04.580 align:middle line:90%


00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:14.990 align:middle line:84%
so you can really see
what the graph is.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.300 align:middle line:84%
I should have brought
different colors.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:22.500 align:middle line:84%
At this point, we
have a relative min.

00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Because nearby points sit
above the value of the function

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.760 align:middle line:90%
evaluated at this point.

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:36.780 align:middle line:84%
So relative max means
nearby points f sits below

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.360 align:middle line:90%
that f evaluated at that point.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.190 align:middle line:84%
And relative min is
the other way around.

00:29:41.190 --> 00:29:49.550 align:middle line:90%


00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:53.600 align:middle line:84%
So I don't think
we need to belabor

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.333 align:middle line:84%
the point of what relative
min relative maxes are.

00:29:56.333 --> 00:29:57.500 align:middle line:90%
I think that's pretty clear.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:06.990 align:middle line:90%


00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:12.550 align:middle line:90%
So the theorem is the following.

00:30:12.550 --> 00:30:17.840 align:middle line:90%


00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:29.970 align:middle line:84%
If f from a, b has a relative
min or max at a point

00:30:29.970 --> 00:30:34.300 align:middle line:84%
c strictly inside this closed
interval, in the open interval

00:30:34.300 --> 00:30:52.340 align:middle line:84%
a, b, then and f is
differentiable at c, then

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:54.470 align:middle line:90%
f prime of c equals 0.

00:30:54.470 --> 00:30:56.330 align:middle line:84%
And this is kind of
clear from this picture,

00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:58.880 align:middle line:84%
although this might look
more like a sawtooth,

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.610 align:middle line:84%
but it shouldn't, that
the tangent at this point

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:03.260 align:middle line:90%
is horizontal.

00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:05.400 align:middle line:84%
And the tangent at this
point is horizontal,

00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:09.770 align:middle line:84%
which just is the expression
that we're just expressing

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:11.840 align:middle line:90%
that f prime of c equals 0.

00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.840 align:middle line:84%
Because f prime of c is supposed
to be the slope of the tangent.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:27.850 align:middle line:90%


00:31:27.850 --> 00:31:31.240 align:middle line:90%
So the idea of the proof is--

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.070 align:middle line:84%
and we'll do it
for relative max.

00:31:33.070 --> 00:31:36.820 align:middle line:84%
Relative min you get
by taking minus f.

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:52.520 align:middle line:84%
So we'll do it for suppose f
has a relative max at c in a, b.

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:59.040 align:middle line:90%


00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:04.440 align:middle line:84%
Then so I'm just going
to draw a picture

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.410 align:middle line:84%
to illustrate why
this is the case, so

00:32:07.410 --> 00:32:09.610 align:middle line:84%
or why what I'm about
to say is the case.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:13.650 align:middle line:90%
So we have a, b, we have c.

00:32:13.650 --> 00:32:24.220 align:middle line:84%
Then there exist delta
positive, say delta one,

00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.830 align:middle line:90%
such that two things are true.

00:32:26.830 --> 00:32:32.730 align:middle line:90%


00:32:32.730 --> 00:32:42.510 align:middle line:84%
x or c minus delta 1 c plus
delta 1 is contained in a, b.

00:32:42.510 --> 00:32:54.460 align:middle line:84%
Two, for all x in c minus
delta 1, c plus delta 1,

00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:57.790 align:middle line:84%
f of x is less than
or equal to f of c.

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:04.120 align:middle line:84%
So delta 1 is chosen
as the minimum of--

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.757 align:middle line:84%
so maybe let me not
call it delta one,

00:33:06.757 --> 00:33:07.840 align:middle line:90%
let me just call it delta.

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.060 align:middle line:90%


00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:16.130 align:middle line:84%
So first off, you know
that a, b, open interval,

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:20.490 align:middle line:84%
this is an open set which we've
encountered in the assignments.

00:33:20.490 --> 00:33:34.570 align:middle line:84%
So you can find a
delta so that delta 0,

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.480 align:middle line:84%
say, so that this
interval centered

00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.310 align:middle line:90%
at c is contained in a, b.

00:33:39.310 --> 00:33:41.980 align:middle line:90%


00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:46.540 align:middle line:84%
Now, since f has a relative
maximum at this point,

00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.090 align:middle line:84%
there exist another
delta 1, say,

00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:57.710 align:middle line:84%
so that if I'm
inside that interval,

00:33:57.710 --> 00:34:00.470 align:middle line:84%
then f of x is less
than or equal to f of c

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:03.140 align:middle line:90%
for all x in that interval.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:07.190 align:middle line:84%
And I choose delta to be the
minimum of these two deltas.

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:12.370 align:middle line:84%
And then I will
have a chosen delta

00:34:12.370 --> 00:34:16.435 align:middle line:84%
so that c minus delta
c plus delta is--

00:34:16.435 --> 00:34:21.360 align:middle line:90%


00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:26.264 align:middle line:90%
so here, this one is--

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:34.840 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:37.400 align:middle line:84%
and then delta 0 shows them
so that that is contained.

00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.130 align:middle line:84%
So I choose the minimum
of these deltas.

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.650 align:middle line:84%
And this is the delta I
take for this statement.

00:34:41.650 --> 00:34:45.600 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:50.880 align:middle line:84%
So now, the way we get
that the derivative is 0

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:57.090 align:middle line:84%
is, we're going to approach
c from above and from

00:34:57.090 --> 00:35:01.920 align:middle line:84%
below and use the fact
that we have a relative max

00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:05.850 align:middle line:84%
to show that the derivative is
both bigger than or equal to 0

00:35:05.850 --> 00:35:07.920 align:middle line:90%
and less than or equal to 0.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:17.840 align:middle line:90%
So let xn be c minus--

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.340 align:middle line:90%
how did I write this--

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:27.890 align:middle line:84%
delta over 2n, which is in
the interval c minus delta c

00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.730 align:middle line:90%
for all n.

00:35:28.730 --> 00:35:33.940 align:middle line:90%


00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:38.290 align:middle line:84%
Then what do we know?
xn, the limit as n

00:35:38.290 --> 00:35:44.155 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of c minus
delta over 2, n converges to c.

00:35:44.155 --> 00:35:47.030 align:middle line:90%


00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:53.750 align:middle line:84%
So the derivative at c
is equal to the limit

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:59.090 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity
of f of x sub n minus f

00:35:59.090 --> 00:36:02.720 align:middle line:90%
of c over x sub n minus c.

00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:07.640 align:middle line:90%
Now, what do we note?

00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.170 align:middle line:84%
So x sub is in
this interval here,

00:36:10.170 --> 00:36:12.470 align:middle line:84%
which is contained in
this interval here.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:14.600 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, f of
x sub n is always

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.370 align:middle line:90%
less than or equal to f of c.

00:36:16.370 --> 00:36:20.915 align:middle line:84%
So what's on top is always
less than or equal to 0.

00:36:20.915 --> 00:36:23.890 align:middle line:90%


00:36:23.890 --> 00:36:26.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, x sub n is
always less than c.

00:36:26.770 --> 00:36:31.120 align:middle line:84%
So this thing on bottom
is also less than 0.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.010 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, something
that's less than

00:36:33.010 --> 00:36:35.770 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 0 on top over
something that's less than 0

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:39.010 align:middle line:84%
on bottom must be bigger
than or equal to 0.

00:36:39.010 --> 00:36:45.660 align:middle line:90%


00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:48.510 align:middle line:84%
So that's approaching
c from the left.

00:36:48.510 --> 00:36:55.200 align:middle line:84%
If we approach c from
the right, delta over 2n

00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:05.190 align:middle line:84%
which is contained in c, c
plus delta for all n, then

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:09.030 align:middle line:90%
xn converges to c.

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:14.070 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at f
prime of c, again, this

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.550 align:middle line:84%
is equal to limit as
n goes to infinity

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:23.040 align:middle line:84%
of f of y sub n minus f
of c over y sub n minus c.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:26.820 align:middle line:84%
Again, f of c is a
relative maximum.

00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:30.870 align:middle line:84%
So this thing on top is still
less than or equal to 0.

00:37:30.870 --> 00:37:32.760 align:middle line:84%
And the thing on
bottom though, is now

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:37.140 align:middle line:84%
since y sub n is bigger
than c, this is positive.

00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:40.710 align:middle line:84%
So something on top is negative,
something on top is positive.

00:37:40.710 --> 00:37:43.290 align:middle line:90%
So the limit must be negative.

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:47.050 align:middle line:90%


00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:49.540 align:middle line:84%
So we've just shown
f prime of c is

00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:51.340 align:middle line:90%
both bigger than or equal to 0.

00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.320 align:middle line:84%
And that it's also less
than or equal to 0.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:38:03.500 align:middle line:90%


00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.170 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the derivative
is 0 at this point.

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:13.295 align:middle line:90%


00:38:13.295 --> 00:38:15.170 align:middle line:84%
And again, the proof
for a relative minimum

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:28.893 align:middle line:84%
is very similar, except
that inequality flips signs.

00:38:28.893 --> 00:38:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, you would
get this is less than

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:34.530 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 0, this one would
be bigger than or equal to 0.

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:38.400 align:middle line:84%
But you still get f prime of
c is bounded between 0 and 0.

00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:41.250 align:middle line:90%


00:38:41.250 --> 00:38:49.680 align:middle line:84%
So at a point where we have
a relative minimum strictly

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:55.450 align:middle line:84%
inside the interval, the
derivative must be 0.

00:38:55.450 --> 00:39:00.915 align:middle line:90%


00:39:00.915 --> 00:39:03.290 align:middle line:84%
And the fact that it happens
strictly inside the interval

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:04.100 align:middle line:90%
is important.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:09.050 align:middle line:84%
This is not necessarily
true if the relative max

00:39:09.050 --> 00:39:11.480 align:middle line:84%
or relative min
happens at an endpoint.

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:16.790 align:middle line:84%
Think of f of x
equals x on 0, 1.

00:39:16.790 --> 00:39:20.090 align:middle line:84%
Then it has a absolute minimum
at 0, absolute maximum at 1,

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:23.060 align:middle line:84%
and the derivative is 1
at both points, not 0.

00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.880 align:middle line:84%
So this is only
for relative min,

00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.670 align:middle line:84%
relative maxes
that occur inside--

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:32.750 align:middle line:84%
strictly inside the interval
that the function is defined on

00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:35.400 align:middle line:90%
and where it's differentiable.

00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:38.580 align:middle line:90%


00:39:38.580 --> 00:39:49.310 align:middle line:84%
So now, we have Rolle's
theorem, which is essentially

00:39:49.310 --> 00:39:53.720 align:middle line:90%
the mean value theorem rotated.

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.970 align:middle line:84%
We'll get the mean value
theorem from Rolle's theorem.

00:39:55.970 --> 00:40:07.500 align:middle line:84%
And which states the following,
let f be from a, b to R,

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:08.700 align:middle line:90%
be continuous.

00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:14.400 align:middle line:90%


00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:23.430 align:middle line:84%
So it's continuous at every
point in a, b, differentiable

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:27.787 align:middle line:90%
at every point inside of a, b.

00:40:27.787 --> 00:40:29.620 align:middle line:84%
It could be differentiable
at the endpoints.

00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.120 align:middle line:90%
That's fine.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:33.360 align:middle line:84%
But it has to be differentiable
on the open interval a, b.

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:38.585 align:middle line:90%


00:40:38.585 --> 00:40:43.710 align:middle line:84%
If f of b, a equals
f of b equals 0,

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:51.225 align:middle line:84%
then there exists a point c
in the open interval a, b--

00:40:51.225 --> 00:40:53.950 align:middle line:90%
and this is important--

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:58.570 align:middle line:90%
such that f prime of c equals 0.

00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:02.200 align:middle line:84%
And what's the what's the
picture that goes with this?

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.670 align:middle line:90%
I'm sure you've seen it before.

00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:08.030 align:middle line:90%


00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:16.750 align:middle line:84%
We draw a function that looks
kind of like sine or cosine.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:20.530 align:middle line:84%
But anyways, function
which is 0 here, 0 here.

00:41:20.530 --> 00:41:27.550 align:middle line:84%
Then there has to exist a point
where the tangent is vertical.

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:31.925 align:middle line:84%
In fact, here it can occur
at two different points.

00:41:31.925 --> 00:41:34.355 align:middle line:90%


00:41:34.355 --> 00:41:35.730 align:middle line:84%
But something
that's already kind

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:38.160 align:middle line:84%
of giving the game away as
far as how we'll prove this

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:44.190 align:middle line:84%
is, let's look at where
the function takes

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:46.170 align:middle line:90%
a maximum and a minimum.

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:50.000 align:middle line:90%


00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.855 align:middle line:90%
That is the heart of the proof.

00:41:51.855 --> 00:41:56.100 align:middle line:90%


00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.050 align:middle line:84%
And why can we--
why does it even

00:41:58.050 --> 00:42:00.180 align:middle line:84%
have an absolute maximum
or absolute minimum?

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:03.060 align:middle line:90%


00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:05.030 align:middle line:84%
So I guess I didn't
say this over there

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:07.070 align:middle line:84%
when I discussed relative
min and relative max.

00:42:07.070 --> 00:42:11.790 align:middle line:84%
But an absolute maximum is
also a relative maximum.

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:15.305 align:middle line:84%
And absolute minimum is
also a relative minimum.

00:42:15.305 --> 00:42:18.290 align:middle line:90%


00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:23.230 align:middle line:84%
So let me make this-- this
is kind of a late remark.

00:42:23.230 --> 00:42:30.340 align:middle line:90%


00:42:30.340 --> 00:42:48.260 align:middle line:84%
Absolute max is a relative
max, absolute mins

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.310 align:middle line:90%
is a relative min.

00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:54.120 align:middle line:90%


00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:58.420 align:middle line:84%
So this picture is kind of
given the game away already.

00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:02.020 align:middle line:84%
Let's look at where the
function takes a max and a min.

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:06.030 align:middle line:84%
And why does f take
a max or a min?

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.430 align:middle line:84%
It's because f is continuous
on this closed and bounded

00:43:08.430 --> 00:43:08.930 align:middle line:90%
interval.

00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:13.050 align:middle line:84%
This is something we proved when
we were discussing continuity,

00:43:13.050 --> 00:43:14.860 align:middle line:90%
the min max theorem.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:18.510 align:middle line:90%
So let's give the proof.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:27.150 align:middle line:90%


00:43:27.150 --> 00:43:42.260 align:middle line:84%
Since f is continuous on a,
b, f achieves a relative max

00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:56.940 align:middle line:84%
at some point c1 in a, b, and
relative min at c2 in a, b.

00:43:56.940 --> 00:44:05.080 align:middle line:90%


00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:09.705 align:middle line:90%
If there exists an x--

00:44:09.705 --> 00:44:10.205 align:middle line:90%
also.

00:44:10.205 --> 00:44:15.700 align:middle line:90%


00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:21.210 align:middle line:84%
If of f of c1 is positive,
then what can you say?

00:44:21.210 --> 00:44:24.290 align:middle line:84%
Well, c1 cannot be
one of the endpoints,

00:44:24.290 --> 00:44:29.240 align:middle line:84%
because at the endpoints, f
of a equals f of b equals 0.

00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:32.000 align:middle line:90%


00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.630 align:middle line:84%
This implies c1 is
in the open interval

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:39.950 align:middle line:84%
a, b, which implies by the
previous theorem, f prime

00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:42.890 align:middle line:90%
of c1 equals 0.

00:44:42.890 --> 00:44:47.250 align:middle line:90%
So here you-- c equals c1.

00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:51.990 align:middle line:90%


00:44:51.990 --> 00:44:58.500 align:middle line:84%
If I'm at the minimum now,
and this is less than 0,

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:07.370 align:middle line:84%
then again, this implies that
c2 is in the open interval a,

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:15.300 align:middle line:84%
b, which implies since f has
a minimum at c2, f prime of c2

00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.310 align:middle line:84%
equals 0 by the
previous theorem.

00:45:17.310 --> 00:45:19.380 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we
could take c equals c2.

00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:24.320 align:middle line:90%


00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:29.930 align:middle line:84%
If-- now, this is two cases--
f of c1, if either f of c1

00:45:29.930 --> 00:45:32.600 align:middle line:84%
is positive or f of
c2 is less than 0,

00:45:32.600 --> 00:45:42.920 align:middle line:84%
then we have the result. If f of
c1 is less than or equal to 0,

00:45:42.920 --> 00:45:46.040 align:middle line:84%
is less than or
equal to f of c2,

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:50.270 align:middle line:84%
now remember, f
achieves a max that c1.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.253 align:middle line:90%
F achieves a min at c2.

00:45:52.253 --> 00:45:54.170 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
should always be less than

00:45:54.170 --> 00:45:54.980 align:middle line:90%
or equal to this.

00:45:54.980 --> 00:46:08.110 align:middle line:90%


00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.615 align:middle line:90%
If the max and the min--

00:46:10.615 --> 00:46:16.620 align:middle line:90%


00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:23.920 align:middle line:84%
so first off, I want
to make sure I'm

00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.300 align:middle line:90%
getting my logic correct here.

00:46:25.300 --> 00:46:44.980 align:middle line:90%


00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:52.285 align:middle line:84%
So rather than state it this
way, let's do it like this.

00:46:52.285 --> 00:47:02.850 align:middle line:90%


00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:05.300 align:middle line:84%
So in terms of the
picture here, this

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:12.440 align:middle line:84%
would be c1, c2, where we
achieve a max and a min.

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:36.060 align:middle line:84%
Then in the final case
that f of c1 and then, so

00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:37.530 align:middle line:90%
this is the max.

00:47:37.530 --> 00:47:41.385 align:middle line:84%
0 is equal to f
evaluated at a point.

00:47:41.385 --> 00:47:52.130 align:middle line:90%


00:47:52.130 --> 00:48:08.960 align:middle line:90%
Then-- all right.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:12.990 align:middle line:84%
So let me go back to what I
was going to say a minute ago.

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:18.050 align:middle line:84%
So in the last case, that f of
c1 is less than or equal to 0

00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:19.880 align:middle line:90%
is less than f of c2.

00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:27.530 align:middle line:84%
Now, remember, this is the
min, this is the max of f.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:32.900 align:middle line:84%
So this should always
sit above f of c2.

00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:40.490 align:middle line:84%
So that implies that f
of c1 equals f of c2.

00:48:40.490 --> 00:48:42.620 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the max
and min equal each other.

00:48:42.620 --> 00:48:46.400 align:middle line:90%


00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:55.110 align:middle line:84%
Which implies for all x
and a, b, since f of c1

00:48:55.110 --> 00:49:01.048 align:middle line:84%
is the minimum, or
f of c2 is the--

00:49:01.048 --> 00:49:09.350 align:middle line:90%


00:49:09.350 --> 00:49:12.810 align:middle line:84%
so I started off with something
here, there, and in between,

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:22.460 align:middle line:84%
which implies for all x in
a, b, f of x equals f of c2.

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:24.500 align:middle line:90%
So that means f is constant.

00:49:24.500 --> 00:49:31.200 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:33.750 align:middle line:84%
And we know what the derivative
of a constant function is.

00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:35.820 align:middle line:90%
It's just 0.

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:36.570 align:middle line:90%
So we could take--

00:49:36.570 --> 00:49:41.415 align:middle line:90%


00:49:41.415 --> 00:49:42.165 align:middle line:90%
say, the midpoint.

00:49:42.165 --> 00:49:48.440 align:middle line:90%


00:49:48.440 --> 00:49:50.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's the end.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:54.690 align:middle line:84%
Sorry that I kind of fumbled
through that for a minute,

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:57.370 align:middle line:90%
but--

00:49:57.370 --> 00:49:58.870 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:49:58.870 --> 00:50:03.370 align:middle line:84%
So for any function which
is 0 at the endpoints,

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:09.130 align:middle line:84%
there has to be a point in
between where the function is--

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:12.040 align:middle line:84%
the derivative of the
function equals 0.

00:50:12.040 --> 00:50:19.460 align:middle line:84%
Now, again, we should come
back to when we see a theorem,

00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.640 align:middle line:84%
we should pick it
apart a little bit

00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.275 align:middle line:84%
to see what's
necessary, what's not.

00:50:23.275 --> 00:50:26.898 align:middle line:90%


00:50:26.898 --> 00:50:29.482 align:middle line:84%
We had these two
hypotheses coming in,

00:50:29.482 --> 00:50:31.690 align:middle line:84%
that if the function is
continuous and differentiable

00:50:31.690 --> 00:50:37.030 align:middle line:84%
on this open interval a,
b, are these necessary?

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:59.740 align:middle line:84%
So for example, let's
say I have the function--

00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:05.560 align:middle line:84%
if I look at the function 1
minus the absolute value of x.

00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:17.360 align:middle line:84%
So at minus 1, 1, 1, this
is a continuous function

00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:25.305 align:middle line:90%
on minus 1, 1.

00:51:25.305 --> 00:51:28.920 align:middle line:90%


00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:32.310 align:middle line:84%
And f of minus 1
equals f of 1 equals 0.

00:51:32.310 --> 00:51:36.000 align:middle line:84%
But there is no point where
f prime of c equals 0.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.160 align:middle line:84%
What hypothesis did I leave
out for this function?

00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.320 align:middle line:90%
The fact that it's--

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:42.930 align:middle line:84%
the hypothesis that it's
differentiable at every point

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:44.370 align:middle line:90%
in between.

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:46.200 align:middle line:84%
This function is
not differentiable.

00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:58.280 align:middle line:90%


00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:01.340 align:middle line:84%
But there's no point where
the derivative equals 0.

00:52:01.340 --> 00:52:05.420 align:middle line:84%
So this example tells
you that the hypothesis

00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:10.550 align:middle line:84%
that the function
is differentiable

00:52:10.550 --> 00:52:14.750 align:middle line:84%
on the interval
minus 1, 1, or a, b,

00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:17.585 align:middle line:84%
is necessary for the
theorem to be true.

00:52:17.585 --> 00:52:18.710 align:middle line:90%
That's what I'm getting at.

00:52:18.710 --> 00:52:26.590 align:middle line:90%


00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:30.610 align:middle line:84%
Now, the other hypothesis
that the function

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:37.420 align:middle line:84%
is continuous on the closed
interval is also necessary.

00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.455 align:middle line:90%
Let's say I look at--

00:52:38.455 --> 00:52:43.470 align:middle line:90%


00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:46.510 align:middle line:84%
and this is pretty easy to
come up with a counter-example,

00:52:46.510 --> 00:52:47.640 align:middle line:90%
if I don't assume that.

00:52:47.640 --> 00:52:54.180 align:middle line:90%


00:52:54.180 --> 00:53:06.820 align:middle line:84%
Let's take the
function which is--

00:53:06.820 --> 00:53:22.480 align:middle line:90%


00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:25.810 align:middle line:84%
the function that's x minus
1 for x not equal to minus 1,

00:53:25.810 --> 00:53:29.470 align:middle line:90%
and 0 for x equal to minus 1.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:31.240 align:middle line:84%
So does is this
function look like?

00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:41.810 align:middle line:90%


00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:51.860 align:middle line:84%
So this function here is
differentiable on minus 1, 1,

00:53:51.860 --> 00:53:56.600 align:middle line:84%
f of minus 1 equals
f of 1 equals 0.

00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:04.250 align:middle line:84%
But again, there's no
point c in minus 1, 1 so

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:08.660 align:middle line:90%
that f prime of c equals 0.

00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:13.940 align:middle line:84%
Because the derivative in
between minus 1, 1 is just 1.

00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:17.780 align:middle line:84%
So both of these
hypotheses, that f

00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.690 align:middle line:84%
is continuous on the closed
interval and differentiable

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:23.720 align:middle line:84%
on the open interval, are
necessary for this theorem

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:24.590 align:middle line:90%
to be true.

00:54:24.590 --> 00:54:27.827 align:middle line:84%
If you drop either
of those hypotheses,

00:54:27.827 --> 00:54:28.910 align:middle line:90%
then the theorem is false.

00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:45.800 align:middle line:90%


00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:49.340 align:middle line:84%
So let's rotate this
picture here and arrive

00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.480 align:middle line:90%
at the mean value theorem.

00:54:50.480 --> 00:55:03.120 align:middle line:90%


00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:09.040 align:middle line:84%
Let f from a, b to
R be continuous.

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:16.600 align:middle line:84%
So it's continuous on the closed
interval a, b, differentiable

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.100 align:middle line:90%
on a, b.

00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:25.750 align:middle line:90%


00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:29.800 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists a c
in the open interval

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:40.166 align:middle line:90%
a, b such that f prime of c--

00:55:40.166 --> 00:55:41.410 align:middle line:90%
let me write it this way--

00:55:41.410 --> 00:55:47.002 align:middle line:90%


00:55:47.002 --> 00:55:54.800 align:middle line:84%
f of b minus f of
a times b minus a.

00:55:54.800 --> 00:55:58.500 align:middle line:90%


00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:04.560 align:middle line:84%
So why do I refer to it as a
rotated picture and shifted

00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.820 align:middle line:90%
version of Rolle's theorem?

00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:08.560 align:middle line:90%


00:56:08.560 --> 00:56:11.060 align:middle line:90%
So there's a, b.

00:56:11.060 --> 00:56:14.450 align:middle line:90%
Here's f of a, f of b.

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:20.860 align:middle line:84%
And let's say that's
how the function looks.

00:56:20.860 --> 00:56:27.300 align:middle line:84%
Now, the slope of the line
connecting f of b to f of a

00:56:27.300 --> 00:56:29.602 align:middle line:90%
is exactly f of b minus f of a.

00:56:29.602 --> 00:56:34.090 align:middle line:90%


00:56:34.090 --> 00:56:40.080 align:middle line:84%
So the slope of that line
is f of b minus f of a.

00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:45.980 align:middle line:84%
And what we're stating is
that there's a point c,

00:56:45.980 --> 00:56:53.050 align:middle line:84%
so that the tangent at that
point is parallel to that line,

00:56:53.050 --> 00:57:00.220 align:middle line:84%
has the same slope as the line
connecting f of b to f of a.

00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:09.480 align:middle line:90%


00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.800 align:middle line:84%
So this theorem really does
reduce to Rolle's theorem.

00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:23.020 align:middle line:84%
So let me define a
function g from a, b

00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:30.770 align:middle line:84%
to R, which satisfies the
hypotheses of Rolle's theorem

00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:35.050 align:middle line:84%
and will give us what
we want, basically.

00:57:35.050 --> 00:57:43.270 align:middle line:84%
So g of x equals f
of x minus f of b,

00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:54.290 align:middle line:84%
plus f of b minus f of a over
b minus a times b minus x.

00:57:54.290 --> 00:57:57.960 align:middle line:90%


00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.210 align:middle line:84%
Basically, what this
function g does is,

00:58:00.210 --> 00:58:04.470 align:middle line:84%
it takes the function
now and rotates it,

00:58:04.470 --> 00:58:07.500 align:middle line:90%
and shifts it down, so that f--

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:10.215 align:middle line:84%
these two points then
coincide and give you 0.

00:58:10.215 --> 00:58:15.920 align:middle line:90%


00:58:15.920 --> 00:58:24.190 align:middle line:84%
Then g is continuous on
the closed interval a, b.

00:58:24.190 --> 00:58:24.690 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:58:24.690 --> 00:58:27.960 align:middle line:84%
Because it's a sum of two
continuous functions on a, b.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.570 align:middle line:90%
f of x is continuous on a, b.

00:58:30.570 --> 00:58:32.220 align:middle line:90%
And this is just a constant.

00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.580 align:middle line:90%
That's just a constant.

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:35.580 align:middle line:90%
This is a polynomial.

00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:47.500 align:middle line:84%
So g is continuous on a, b,
and differentiable on a, b,

00:58:47.500 --> 00:58:49.240 align:middle line:90%
again, because f is.

00:58:49.240 --> 00:58:52.630 align:middle line:84%
F is differentiable on
the open interval a, b.

00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:55.240 align:middle line:84%
This part is
differentiable everywhere

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.350 align:middle line:84%
so the sum of two differentiable
functions is differential.

00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:01.030 align:middle line:84%
So g of x is
differentiable on a, b.

00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:04.580 align:middle line:90%


00:59:04.580 --> 00:59:09.010 align:middle line:84%
So continuous on a, b and
differentiable on a, b.

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:12.902 align:middle line:90%


00:59:12.902 --> 00:59:15.110 align:middle line:84%
And since I said, we're
going to use Rolle's theorem,

00:59:15.110 --> 00:59:16.767 align:middle line:90%
let's compute g of a.

00:59:16.767 --> 00:59:22.280 align:middle line:84%
This is equal to f
of a minus f of b,

00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:30.800 align:middle line:84%
plus f of b minus f of a, over
b minus a, times b minus a.

00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.150 align:middle line:90%
That cancels with that.

00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:34.770 align:middle line:84%
Minus f of b
cancels with f of b.

00:59:34.770 --> 00:59:37.790 align:middle line:84%
f of a cancels with minus
f of a, and we get 0.

00:59:37.790 --> 00:59:41.391 align:middle line:90%


00:59:41.391 --> 00:59:45.080 align:middle line:84%
And then, g of b, this
is even easier to see.

00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:46.580 align:middle line:84%
If I just stick
this in, this is f

00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:56.690 align:middle line:84%
of b minus f of b plus f of b
minus f of a, over b minus a,

00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:58.460 align:middle line:90%
b minus b.

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:00.290 align:middle line:90%
And this also equals 0.

01:00:00.290 --> 01:00:02.930 align:middle line:90%
So g of a and g of b are 0.

01:00:02.930 --> 01:00:05.180 align:middle line:84%
The function is continuous
on the closed interval.

01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.160 align:middle line:84%
It's differentiable
on the open interval.

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:15.073 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by
Rolle's theorem--

01:00:15.073 --> 01:00:17.490 align:middle line:84%
I think there's supposed to
be some sort of accent over O,

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:22.360 align:middle line:84%
but I can't remember, and
I've forgotten it already.

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:28.600 align:middle line:84%
By Rolle's theorem, there
exist a point c in a, b, such

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:40.850 align:middle line:84%
that 0 is equal to g prime
of c, which is equal to--

01:00:40.850 --> 01:00:43.430 align:middle line:84%
we take g and actually
compute what the derivative is

01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:49.010 align:middle line:90%
at c, is equal to f prime of c.

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:51.650 align:middle line:84%
That's a constant
derivative of that is 0.

01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:55.310 align:middle line:84%
This times this, the derivative
of x evaluated at c just

01:00:55.310 --> 01:01:05.590 align:middle line:84%
gives me minus f of b minus
f of a, times b minus a.

01:01:05.590 --> 01:01:08.700 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:12.330 align:middle line:84%
0 is equal to f prime
of c minus what we want.

01:01:12.330 --> 01:01:15.485 align:middle line:84%
We move that to the other side,
multiply through by b minus a,

01:01:15.485 --> 01:01:16.110 align:middle line:90%
and we're done.

01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:34.790 align:middle line:90%


01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:41.480 align:middle line:84%
So some first very
nice applications

01:01:41.480 --> 01:01:43.160 align:middle line:84%
of the mean value
theorem, which I

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.280 align:middle line:84%
think you learned from
calculus are the following.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:02:13.080 align:middle line:90%


01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:18.080 align:middle line:84%
Let f from I to R
be differentiable,

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:24.010 align:middle line:84%
meaning it's differentiable at
every point in the interval I.

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:27.130 align:middle line:90%
Then we have two conclusions.

01:02:27.130 --> 01:02:36.860 align:middle line:84%
f is increasing, meaning
we recall what that means,

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:42.860 align:middle line:84%
for f to be increasing, that
means that if x is less than y,

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:47.150 align:middle line:84%
this implies f of x is less
than or equal to f of y.

01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:50.960 align:middle line:90%


01:02:50.960 --> 01:03:01.160 align:middle line:84%
This is equivalent
to for all x in I,

01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:03.710 align:middle line:84%
f prime of x is bigger
than or equal to 0.

01:03:03.710 --> 01:03:06.890 align:middle line:84%
So remember, f prime
is the rate of change.

01:03:06.890 --> 01:03:08.850 align:middle line:84%
If the rate of change
is always non-negative,

01:03:08.850 --> 01:03:10.590 align:middle line:90%
then f has to be growing.

01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:19.970 align:middle line:84%
But this says, f is decreasing,
meaning x less than y

01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:25.760 align:middle line:84%
implies f of x is bigger
than or equal to f of y.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:30.080 align:middle line:84%
This is equivalent to since
a function is increasing

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.780 align:middle line:84%
if and only if minus
f is decreasing,

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:34.250 align:middle line:90%
this inequality should flip.

01:03:34.250 --> 01:03:52.570 align:middle line:90%


01:03:52.570 --> 01:03:56.950 align:middle line:84%
So I'm going to do increasing--
decreasing follows from number

01:03:56.950 --> 01:03:58.870 align:middle line:90%
one by taking minus f.

01:03:58.870 --> 01:04:09.130 align:middle line:90%


01:04:09.130 --> 01:04:13.040 align:middle line:90%
So how much time do I have?

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:13.810 align:middle line:90%
I still have time.

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:21.030 align:middle line:90%


01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:28.012 align:middle line:84%
So suppose first that f prime
of x is always non-negative.

01:04:28.012 --> 01:04:32.120 align:middle line:90%


01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:43.550 align:middle line:84%
Let a, b be in I.
[SNEEZES] Excuse me.

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:47.872 align:middle line:90%


01:04:47.872 --> 01:04:50.330 align:middle line:84%
We now want to show f of a is
less than or equal to f of b.

01:04:50.330 --> 01:04:55.390 align:middle line:90%


01:04:55.390 --> 01:05:01.560 align:middle line:84%
Then f is continuous on
this smaller interval a, b.

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:02.400 align:middle line:90%
Why?

01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.950 align:middle line:84%
Because f is differentiable
at every point in I.

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:11.070 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, it is
continuous at every point in I.

01:05:11.070 --> 01:05:24.250 align:middle line:84%
So in particular on this smaller
interval, and differentiable

01:05:24.250 --> 01:05:33.190 align:middle line:84%
on a, b, which implies
there exists a c in a, b--

01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:42.370 align:middle line:84%
So by the mean value
theorem, such that f

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:49.630 align:middle line:84%
of b minus f of a equals f
prime of c times b minus a.

01:05:49.630 --> 01:05:53.410 align:middle line:84%
And now, since the derivative
is always non-negative

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:57.400 align:middle line:84%
and b minus a is positive, this
is bigger than or equal to 0.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:59.020 align:middle line:90%
I.e.

01:05:59.020 --> 01:06:01.825 align:middle line:84%
if a b minus f of a is
bigger than or equal to 0.

01:06:01.825 --> 01:06:07.280 align:middle line:90%


01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:08.840 align:middle line:90%
So we prove in one direction.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:19.790 align:middle line:84%
We've proven that if you
like that the function's

01:06:19.790 --> 01:06:22.400 align:middle line:84%
derivative being non-negative
implies that the function is

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.910 align:middle line:90%
increasing.

01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:26.760 align:middle line:84%
So now let's prove the
opposite direction.

01:06:26.760 --> 01:06:35.010 align:middle line:90%


01:06:35.010 --> 01:06:54.100 align:middle line:84%
So suppose f is
increasing and c is in I.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:07:07.100 align:middle line:84%
Let xn be a sequence in I,
such that xn converges to c.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.695 align:middle line:90%
And one of two things holds.

01:07:09.695 --> 01:07:12.770 align:middle line:90%


01:07:12.770 --> 01:07:28.580 align:middle line:84%
And either let's say, a,
all n xn is less than c,

01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:32.900 align:middle line:90%
or b, all n xn is bigger than c.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:35.480 align:middle line:84%
And we can always find such
a sequence given a point

01:07:35.480 --> 01:07:39.920 align:middle line:90%
C in the interval I.

01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:48.520 align:middle line:84%
So if I, so let's say,
it's a closed interval.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:51.280 align:middle line:90%
And c is in here.

01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:55.780 align:middle line:84%
Then we can find a sequence
xn converging to c,

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:57.505 align:middle line:90%
approaching c from the left.

01:07:57.505 --> 01:08:00.430 align:middle line:90%


01:08:00.430 --> 01:08:03.010 align:middle line:84%
If c is one of the
endpoints, then we

01:08:03.010 --> 01:08:06.520 align:middle line:84%
can find a sequence from I
approaching c from the right.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:07.900 align:middle line:90%
That's b.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.790 align:middle line:84%
And the same thing
if c is over here we

01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:13.330 align:middle line:84%
can find a sequence approaching
c, strictly from the left.

01:08:13.330 --> 01:08:15.940 align:middle line:90%


01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:18.400 align:middle line:84%
So there always exists
such a sequence.

01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:28.960 align:middle line:90%


01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:29.700 align:middle line:90%
Always exists.

01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:32.979 align:middle line:90%


01:08:32.979 --> 01:08:38.795 align:middle line:84%
And this is because,
I is an interval.

01:08:38.795 --> 01:08:53.500 align:middle line:90%


01:08:53.500 --> 01:09:00.750 align:middle line:84%
And if the sequence satisfies
case a, and we look at f prime,

01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:08.569 align:middle line:84%
then we get that f
of xn is less than

01:09:08.569 --> 01:09:14.120 align:middle line:90%
or equal to f of c for all n.

01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:17.090 align:middle line:84%
And let me in fact write this
a little bit differently.

01:09:17.090 --> 01:09:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Since-- so here we're
using that f as increasing.

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:28.880 align:middle line:90%


01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.689 align:middle line:84%
Since f is increasing,
which implies

01:09:34.689 --> 01:09:42.700 align:middle line:84%
for all n, f of xn minus f
of c over x of n minus c--

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:48.729 align:middle line:84%
now, this thing on top is
negative. xn is less than c.

01:09:48.729 --> 01:09:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So this thing on the
bottom is also negative.

01:09:53.830 --> 01:09:57.940 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
thing is, positive--

01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:00.860 align:middle line:90%
non-negative, I mean.

01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:03.020 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, the limit
must also be negative.

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:05.610 align:middle line:90%


01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:08.280 align:middle line:84%
But that limit is just a
derivative evaluated at c.

01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:21.070 align:middle line:90%


01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:23.230 align:middle line:90%
And case b is kind of similar.

01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:27.040 align:middle line:90%
I mean, not kind of, it is.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:32.500 align:middle line:84%
In case b, we get that
for all n, f of xn,

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.600 align:middle line:84%
now, since x tends
to the right of c--

01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:37.890 align:middle line:90%


01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:39.140 align:middle line:90%
let me write it this way.

01:10:39.140 --> 01:10:42.110 align:middle line:90%


01:10:42.110 --> 01:10:46.040 align:middle line:84%
This minus f of c is
bigger than or equal to 0,

01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:51.950 align:middle line:84%
which implies that
f prime of c, which

01:10:51.950 --> 01:10:56.360 align:middle line:84%
is the limit as n goes
to infinity of f of xn

01:10:56.360 --> 01:11:01.040 align:middle line:90%
minus f of c over xn minus c.

01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:02.798 align:middle line:90%
What's on top is non-negative.

01:11:02.798 --> 01:11:04.340 align:middle line:84%
And what's on bottom
is non-negative,

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:08.120 align:middle line:90%
because xn is bigger than c.

01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:12.382 align:middle line:84%
So bigger than 0, bigger
than 0, bigger than 0.

01:11:12.382 --> 01:11:19.660 align:middle line:90%


01:11:19.660 --> 01:11:22.210 align:middle line:84%
Thus in either
case, we get that f

01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:24.533 align:middle line:84%
prime of c is bigger
than or equal to 0.

01:11:24.533 --> 01:11:28.915 align:middle line:90%


01:11:28.915 --> 01:11:31.290 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we've proven
that the derivative is always

01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:33.540 align:middle line:90%
non-negative.

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:36.570 align:middle line:90%
So that's one.

01:11:36.570 --> 01:11:48.870 align:middle line:84%
And two, f is
decreasing if and only

01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:56.910 align:middle line:84%
if the function minus f is
increasing, which by what

01:11:56.910 --> 01:12:02.610 align:middle line:84%
we've done from part one is if
and only if minus f prime of x

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:07.530 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or equal to
0 for all x in I. And then,

01:12:07.530 --> 01:12:15.750 align:middle line:84%
multiplying through by this
minus 1 gives me number two.

01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:22.570 align:middle line:90%


01:12:22.570 --> 01:12:26.620 align:middle line:90%
And so, let me make one last--

01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:28.960 align:middle line:84%
I know it's taboo to
write on the back part.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.610 align:middle line:90%
But I'm going to do it anyways.

01:12:30.610 --> 01:12:33.325 align:middle line:84%
We have the very simple
theorem which now follows.

01:12:33.325 --> 01:12:38.830 align:middle line:90%


01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:47.890 align:middle line:84%
Let f from I to R
be differentiable,

01:12:47.890 --> 01:12:53.630 align:middle line:90%
then f is constant.

01:12:53.630 --> 01:12:58.690 align:middle line:84%
So f of x equals f of
y for all x and y in I,

01:12:58.690 --> 01:13:03.770 align:middle line:84%
if and only if the
derivative is identically 0.

01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:09.870 align:middle line:90%


01:13:09.870 --> 01:13:25.630 align:middle line:84%
So f is constant if
and only if f is both

01:13:25.630 --> 01:13:29.690 align:middle line:90%
increasing and decreasing.

01:13:29.690 --> 01:13:37.030 align:middle line:90%


01:13:37.030 --> 01:13:40.600 align:middle line:84%
Because it satisfies the
equality sign in both of those.

01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:46.960 align:middle line:84%
And by what we've done now,
this means for all x in I,

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:52.480 align:middle line:84%
if prime of x is bigger
than or equal to 0, and--

01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.520 align:middle line:84%
that's for the
increasing part-- f prime

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:55.990 align:middle line:90%
of x is less than or equal to 0.

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:58.610 align:middle line:90%


01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:09.530 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, this
is equivalent to f

01:14:09.530 --> 01:14:10.760 align:middle line:90%
prime of x equals 0.

01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:17.820 align:middle line:90%


01:14:17.820 --> 01:14:20.030 align:middle line:90%
So we'll stop there.

01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:27.000 align:middle line:90%

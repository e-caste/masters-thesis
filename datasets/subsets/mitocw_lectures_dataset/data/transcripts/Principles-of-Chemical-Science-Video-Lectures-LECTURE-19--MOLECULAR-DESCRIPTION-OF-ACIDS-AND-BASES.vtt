00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Today is a very big day for all
of you.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Your first semester at MIT is
half over.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And, in addition to that,
you have a lot of challenges

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
remaining ahead of you for the
rest of this semester.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I am going to help make the
chemical challenges fun for you.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
That is what I am here to do.
I love chemistry.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I love teaching 5.112.
This is the best part of my

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
week.
So, here we are.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Do you guys know that chemistry
can be incredibly fun?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let me just show you how fun
chemistry can be.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And that is just the gravy.
The fun part is actually making

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
the molecules.
Any of you see this picture in

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
U.S.A.
Today recently?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Not reading that important
journal, I see.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Well, this picture did appear
very recently in U.S.A.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Today in a story that talked
about the recent Nobel Prize in

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
chemistry that was awarded to
Professor Richard R.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Schrock, of our department.
And, in fact,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I don't know if you realize
this, but Professor Schrock was

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
the first person ever awarded
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry at

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
MIT for work conducted while at
MIT.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
That is a pretty amazing
accomplishment because we have

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
so many tremendous chemists on
the faculty here,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and he is the first one to
break through in that manner.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And maybe you are here at a
very special time,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
and we will see a number more
of these in the next few years.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
May with you contributing,
so much the better because you

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
are here.
And let me just explain

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
something, too.
Chemistry is fun.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And only on very rare occasions
like this would Professor

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Schrock be drinking champagne at
8:30 in the morning,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000
when this picture was taken.
The Reuters reporter,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Brian, who took this photo,
is actually a pretty good

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
friend of Professor Nocera here.
And so he rode over from the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Schrock household.
And Dick and Dan came in

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
together in the same car,
as they often do,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
from Winchester on that
morning, which was a very

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
exciting day.
If you come to see me for

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
office hours maybe I will tell
you more about it in detail,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
but it was an exciting day.
And I am in here,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
too.
My name is Kit Cummins.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Kit is my nickname.
My name is Christopher.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
You can call me Christopher or
Kit, or you can call me

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Professor Cummins,
or you can just say hey,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
chemistry guy.
That will be fine.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
I am in this picture primarily
because it is part of being in

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
the right place at the right
time, just like I am here now in

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
front of you.
But also I am in it because we

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
three are three in one of the
areas in our department that

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
really focus our research on
inorganic chemistry.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
And what is inorganic
chemistry?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
I will say more about this
during the semester.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
But inorganic chemistry is
really the chemistry of the

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
elements of the Periodic Table
inclusively.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
So, a pretty broad topic.
And I like doing chemistry with

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
lots of elements.
And so that is why these guys

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
and I share an association with
each other.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
And, in fact,
I was a graduate student with

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Professor Schrock.
And I am very,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
very proud to be able to say
that.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Hopefully, my computer will be
staying on, here.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
And I want to point out,
too, that people who love

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
science want to know something
about its history.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
And part of all of that is
knowing the academic family from

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
which you derive,
depending on the person you've

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
studied with in learning about
chemistry.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
And I studied with Schrock.
And Schrock studied with

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Osborn, a fantastic chemist in
his own right,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
no longer alive,
sadly, to see his progeny,

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Professor Schrock,
win the Nobel Prize.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000
And Osborn studied with
Wilkinson, and Wilkinson was

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000
also a Nobel Prize winner.
So, you do not have to go very

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
far back in that lineage to
encounter that recognition,

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
the Nobel Prize,
Schrock, and then it skipped

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Osborne, and if you go back to
Wilkinson, there is another one.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
And you can keep going back.
And I am not going to go

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
through that whole history today
because I have another history

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000
that I am going to need to go
through with you today.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And I am going to bring this
back over so it does not

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:48.000
distract you.
And this other history that I

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:57.000
need to impart to you today has
to do with some of the

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.000
contributions of Gilbert Newton
Lewis.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
This is one of the most famous
of all chemists ever.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.000
And if you like chemistry,
I encourage you to think of the

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000
word Newton, as it is found
engraved in one of the pillars

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
in Killian Court at MIT as the
middle name of Gilbert Newton

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Lewis.
It is conceivable that having

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
that middle name weighed heavily
upon Gilbert during his

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000
lifetime.
But it remains a good moniker.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
And in the future,
when you have kids,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000
I encourage you to consider
using it as a middle name.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It worked well in this
particular case.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
When you get the notes for
today, which incidentally will

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
be available on the website
after class today,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000
so you don't need to write down
everything I am writing down.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
You are actually going to get a
little bit more in the online

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000
version than what I am writing
down here.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000
And if you find that you forgot
something that I said during

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
class, just email me.
I will tell you what I said.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000
It is not a problem.
But if you want to write down

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
notes while I am speaking just
to make notes that you can refer

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
to later to refresh your memory,
that is fine.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
I think your taking in
information in lots of different

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000
ways.
We are going to use the

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
computer and we are going to use
the blackboard today.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And you are going to have
available stuff from the

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
Internet a little bit later,
too.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And all of that is good.
I think you should try to

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
reinforce and not worry if some
of the information is a little

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
redundant.
And never be afraid to ask

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000
questions, especially,
I like to take questions by

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000
email or if you come knock on my
office door.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
In 1916, Gilbert Lewis
published a landmark paper in

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000
chemistry in the journal of the
American Chemical Society which

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:14.000
remains the flagship journal of
the American Chemical Society.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000
And this paper was entitled
"The Atom and the Molecule."

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Besides being an incredibly
important and influential paper

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
in the history of chemistry,
"The Atom and the Molecule" was

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
also the basis for --

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Like I said,
besides being a hugely

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
influential manuscript,
"The Atom and the Molecule"

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
also laid the foundations for
Lewis's thinking about

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
electronic structure theory that
shaped the way we still today

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000
talk about valence and chemical
bonding.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
So, an incredibly important
paper from 1916.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000
In the lecture notes today,
you will find the specific

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000
volume and page number for that
reference in the journal of the

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
American Chemical Society.
And I encourage you in your

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000
copious free time to download
that paper.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000
It is really great.
All the American Chemical

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Society journal articles are
available, from the very

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000
beginning.
And you can download it and

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
read it.
And, having had this

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
introduction today,
I think it will probably prove

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
to be a very fascinating
exercise for you,

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000
if you choose to do so.
It also was the basis of a book

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.000
that Gilbert Newton Lewis later
wrote on valance and on atoms

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and molecules.
That is also a classic in

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000
chemistry.
And, should you be shopping for

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
chemistry books on e-bay or
something, you might find a rare

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
copy of it.
And if you do and choose not to

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
buy it, please alert me and I
will buy it.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
But Gilbert Newton Lewis,
"The Atom and the Molecule."

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000
In this paper you are going to
see, if you do choose to

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:49.000
download it, that he was
thinking about polarity.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000
And he was also thinking about
the relationship between the

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:05.000
polarity of a molecule relates
to the polarity of a substance.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And I mean, when I say a
polarity of a substance,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000
that that would be a sample,
you could say a water molecule

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
down here and liquid water up
here.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000
And you will see this kind of
sigmoidal graph that Lewis made

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:33.000
in thinking about how polar
condensed phase substances were

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
as compared with the structure
of the molecules that comprise

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
the substance.
Down here, in this region,

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
you will find that there are
substances that are not terribly

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000
polar.
And what I have written here is

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.000
the organic shorthand for the
hexane molecule.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Liquid hexane is an alkane,
akin to methane,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
which is natural gas.
And so, if you are not familiar

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
with this way of writing organic
molecules, I will just tell you

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
briefly that this terminus is CH
three or a methyl group,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
and then it is CH two,
CH two, CH two,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
CH two, and then CH three,
another methyl group.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
So, that is some
organic shorthand.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000
And I will go through that kind
of shorthand occasionally so

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000
that you become familiar with
it.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
And that is the hexane
molecule, a very non-polar

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000
molecule composed of elements,
carbon and hydrogen,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000
that have very similar
electronegativity.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
And then he goes on up the
curve here, and you find this

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
familiar molecule,
benzene, considered next,

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000
as being somehow more polar
than hexane, and liquid benzene

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.000
accordingly in its solvating
properties in the condensed

00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000
phase, being a more polar
medium, as it were.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000
And then, as we continue
progress up this scale,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
he writes next molecules like
the diethyl ether molecule.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000
No doubt you are familiar with
ether and its applications as an

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
anesthetic.
The first use of ether as an

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000
anesthesia in an operation in
medicine was carried out just

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:28.000
across the river in Boston.
There is this historical Ether

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Dome there that you can go and
look at.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
But, nonetheless,
we are just getting up a little

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000
bit more polar than benzene.
And then next you find

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000
molecules like this one.
That contains an organic

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
functional group called an
ester.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000
That is ethyl acetate,
which is a substance that you

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000
might have smelled if you ever
built models,

00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000
because some of the glues that
you may have used would contain

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000
it, or the paints.
And so, it is a system that,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
in terms of its molecular
structure, is more polar.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
And, when you use it in the
condensed phase,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000
it behaves in a manner that you
would describe as more polar.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000
And then, finally,
you get up to some very polar

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
systems, like the water
molecule.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Like the ammonia molecule.
And, finally,

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Lewis talks about a species
like this, which is sodium twice

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000
sulfur.
That is actually called sodium

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000
sulfide.
And it is a salt analogous to

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
table salt, sodium chloride.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
And being a salt,
it is obviously very polar

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.000
because there is quite a large
degree of charge separation

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000
between the atoms in the
molecule.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
And, accordingly,
if you take that salt and heat

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
it up until you have got it as
hot as its melting point and

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
make it liquid,
that molten salt has

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
individually charged ions moving
around in solution.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000
And that provides a very polar
medium, which would be excellent

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000
at dissolving polar things.
You will notice here that on

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000
the non-polar side we have
elements, carbon and hydrogen,

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000
that are very close to each
other in electronegativity.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And then, as we examine this
relationship,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000
we start putting in elements
like oxygen or nitrogen,

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
which are very electronegative
close to the upper right-hand

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
side of the Periodic Table.
That introduces polarity both

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
in the molecule and in
substances comprised of the

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
molecule.
And then all the way over to

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.000
the involved atoms,
sodium and sulfur are very

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000
different in electronegativity
and, therefore,

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
have very strongly separated
charges.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000
And, in thinking about this,
Lewis proposed the notion of a

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000
continuum.
And his musing on this are

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000
really quite lucid in that
paper, but the idea was that a

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000
molecule, or a part of a
molecule even,

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000
you can analyze molecules in
terms of smaller pieces of them

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000
that can be identified within
the larger molecule,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000
can lie on either side of a
continuum in reference to a

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:46.000
number of different properties.
And the section of class that

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:53.000
we are launching into today
deals with acid-base properties.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Let's mention that first,
acid and base.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
These are two ends of a
continuum.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:09.000
But he also recognized that you
could have a molecule that would

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000
be an oxidant.
And the counterpart to that is

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000
a reductant.
And then, here is a term that

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:27.000
maybe those of you who have
studied organic chemistry in

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000
more detail than most would
recognize.

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
This is electrophile.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Electrophile has a counterpart
called a nucleophile.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000
And then, the fourth one that I
would like to mention is

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
acceptor.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
And, of course,
the counterpart to that is

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
donor.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000
Please remember those four
pairs because when you can

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000
understand and make predictions
about those four properties as a

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:38.000
function of molecular structure,
then you will be a chemist.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I mean that is a large part of
what it is all about,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000
understanding all the different
chemical properties that will

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
make it interested in terms of
acid-base, oxidant-reductant,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
electrophile-nucleophile,
and acceptor and donor.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
And the currency of chemistry
can be seen, with reference to

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
this, to be the electron.
That is what chemistry is all

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000
about.
And so, we will be talking a

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
lot about atoms and molecules
with reference to their

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000
properties and how the
properties stem from knowing

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000
something about the electrons in
the molecule.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:28.000
And I think you are going to
find this to be quite fun.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000
With respect to the properties
of the medium,

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
let's talk about a substance
like hydrogen chloride.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000
This is just to illustrate what
I was saying over there.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
If you take a molecule like
hydrogen chloride,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000
and it is a gas,
of course.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And if you make a solution of
it in hexane,

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000
hexane is going to be our
solvent, and then what you find

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
is that in this low polarity
medium hexane solution,

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
liquid hexane,
the HCl molecule remains intact

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:27.000
and floats around in solution,
interacting weakly with hexane

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:34.000
molecules that surround it.
But if you take this HCl

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000
molecule and put it into a
solvent like water,

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000
then something on the other end
of the continuum transpires

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
because we get ionization to
produce hydrogen ions.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:59.000
And they go off and are
separated in solution from

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
chloride ions.
And we will talk more about

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
just what is going on when you
separate H plus from Cl

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
minus and let them
diffuse apart in aqueous

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
solution.
But you can see,

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I think, the dichotomy.
Either the proton shares in the

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
electrons of the chloride,
or it just pops off and ionizes

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.000
and goes out into solution.
And Lewis wanted to understand

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:32.000
this.
And, to understand it,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.000
he developed a theory.
And his theory was the "cube

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000
theory." In this part we get to
draw some cubes.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
And he decided that if you
thought of the nucleus,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000
which he calls the kernel,
of an atom as being located at

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000
the center of the system,
then if you had an atom like

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:05.000
neon, which is a noble gas with
eight valance electrons,

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:11.000
that these valance electrons
would want to get away from each

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:19.000
other as far as possible because
they repel each other.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
They are all negatively
charged.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000
This could be,
here, the neon atom.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Here, on that cube,
is how he would represent the

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
electronic structure of the neon
atom, with the eight electrons

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
here represented by
peach-colored circles,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
each the vertex of a cube.
So, they got far away from each

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
other.
And you can see that in the

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
historical archives,
some of his original sketch

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
books containing these ideas are
there, and now you will know

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
what they mean.
You will see that he progressed

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000
beyond understanding the atom to
understanding the molecule.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:07.000
And here is one of the
molecules that he talks about.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Here we have a molecule
containing 14 valance electrons,

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
all arranged in that manner.
And this could be,

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:39.000
for example,
the I two molecule.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:45.000
And let me draw it in terms of
a dot structure,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
--

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000
-- like that.
And there was known at the

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:01.000
time, partly because of the
contributions of Lewis himself,

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000
something called the Rule of
Eight.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
And that was a reference to
this notion that most atoms want

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:14.000
to have eight electrons in their
valance shell,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.000
and it is also something that
we call today the Octet Rule.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
So, when you see the Rule of
Eight mentioned in his paper,

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:31.000
it is the familiar Octet Rule.
And you can see here that one

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.000
of the key features is two
electrons shared equally.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
And when electrons are shared
equally like that,

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000
you have a molecule with
symmetrical charge distribution,

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
charge referring to the
electrons where they are in

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
space.
And then, he showed that you

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
could think about this another
way.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
You could consider some kind of
a geometric distortion of the I

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
two molecule, like this.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Distorted, not only because of
my drawing, but because of the

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000
way the atoms themselves are
thought to be rearranging in

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
this process.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
Notice that what has happened
here is that the I two

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
molecule is doing something
electronically such that one

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
iodine is starting to pull away
from the other.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000
This one over here is carrying
with it the electron that came

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
from over here.
And, in that case,

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000
what we have is a molecule in
which we are developing partial

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
negative charge on the
right-hand side and partial

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:14.000
positive charge on the left-hand
side.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
As I was talking up here,
I was thinking about what I was

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
going to say here,
because the ideal is that

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
molecules, even if they are
inherently non-polar like the I

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
two molecule,
in their equilibrium structure

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
they can have electron
fluctuations that lead to

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
partial charges in the manner
shown here.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
And Lewis was working
beautifully toward the

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
development of a theory like
this that would allow the

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
description of electronic
structure to be made graphically

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.000
apparent.
And this is something that

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
chemists really like to do,
is we like to be able to see

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
stuff.
I hope I am going to be able to

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
show you some really cool stuff
this semester.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
And, in fact,
even some really cool stuff

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
before we finish here today.
So, that is the development of

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
charge as represented using the
Lewis cube theory in an I two

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000
molecule.
Next, one thing you could do is

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.000
say, let's just continue this
process, and the right-hand

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000
iodine with its eight electrons
pops off.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:25.000
That would give you an ionized
situation in which you had an I

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:32.000
minus floating away from
an I plus molecule.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
And that situation is drawn in
the notes, and because I am

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000
running out of space on this
board I am not going to draw

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
that one up.
Instead I am going to go onto

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
another triumph of the Lewis
cube theory, which was its

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
ability to explain different
chemical bond orders.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000
By the way, Lewis never got the
Nobel Prize.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
He certainly should have.
A dramatic oversight.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
He was born in Massachusetts.
He was a Harvard professor for

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000
a while and did not like it,
and came to MIT to be a

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:20.000
professor for a while.
And, although he liked that,

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
that was not far enough away
from Harvard,

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
so he went to Berkeley,
where he became the department

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000
head and was very successful
over a long period of time in

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:37.000
learning about chemistry and in
teaching chemistry.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I will invite you,
and you will see this in the

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:45.000
notes, too, to go ahead and see
if you can find a good biography

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:49.000
of Lewis because it is very
instructive.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Anyway, here is another
molecule considered by Lewis's

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
cube theory.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000
How many electrons are being
shared by the two nuclei or

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000
atoms involved?
Four electrons shared.

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:15.000
We can circle them here.
That is four electrons shared.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Therefore, that is not a single
bond.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:23.000
We call that a double bond.
And so, that might be a

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
representation of,
for example,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
the O two molecule.
Here we have I two,

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000
here we have distorted I two
with charges developing,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:41.000
and here we have O two.
O two is a very

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
interesting diatomic molecule.
We are going to talk about that

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000
later in the semester,
but for now let's just leave it

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:53.000
at that.
But then, even though this was

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:57.000
quite a successful theory,
the cube theory,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
it has certain problems,
certain shortcomings,

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
such as, we can do single bonds
with it quite well,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
and now we can do double bonds
with the cube theory,

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000
but what do you do if you have
to make a triple bond?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
That was a problem for Lewis.
That should be a problem for

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000
you, too.
Cubes just don't fit together

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:24.000
that way.
They have edges and faces,

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:29.000
and that is it.
And they have vertices.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000
You can do one vertex.
So, triple bond is a problem.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000
And we know that there are
molecules that have triple

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000
bonds.
And we cannot handle them with

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
the cube theory,
so we are going to have to

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000
something a little different,
for that reason.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
But there is also another
reason that had to do with just

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000
considering the chemistry of
light elements like hydrogen and

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000
helium.
Those elements tend to

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
associate themselves with only
two electrons.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And so, Lewis decided,
well, maybe the rule of two is

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
more fundamental than the rule
of eight, and that we should be

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
thinking about pairs of
electrons somehow.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Because he looked at what was
known about chemistry and

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
realized that in most molecules,
the number of electrons is

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
always even, is always divisible
by two.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:39.000
That is something interesting
about two electrons at a time

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000
being important.
You take that together with the

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000
triple bond problem,
and Lewis started thinking in

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
terms of electron pairs,
and this is where this

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000
"electron pair theory" comes
from.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Although he spent a lot of time
on the cube theory,

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000
he was perfectly willing to
cast that theory aside in favor

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000
of something that maybe was
going to work a little better,

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000
the electron pair theory.
And how does that look?

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Well, of course,
his initial pictures still had

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000
the cube, which just shows that
once the human mind fixes on

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
something, it fixes on it with
great tenacity and it can be

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
hard to shake your way of
thinking about things.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
But hopefully you will be able
to do that.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
He still decided,
let's arrange these electron

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:50.000
pairs on a cube with the nucleus
of the atom supposed to be at

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000
the center, and let's keep these
electrons, now,

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:58.000
nicely collected in pairs.
And let's get these pairs as

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
far away from each other as
possible, for the same reasons

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000
we used to be putting eight
electrons as far away from each

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000
other as possible,
namely, electron repulsion.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Now, the problem of electron
repulsion between the pairs was

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000
not really solved.
And Lewis decided that the pair

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:25.000
theory worked so well that he
was not going to worry about

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
that, and so we won't worry
about it yet,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000
either.
You have your four pairs of

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:37.000
electrons arranged at the center
of four of the edges of the

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:43.000
cube, and that geometry is what
we call a tetrahedron,

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:47.000
which I am drawing the edges of
here in pink.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:52.000
You have a tetrahedral
disposition of four pairs of

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000
electrons, now,
for an atom.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000
This might again be the neon
atom.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:11.000
But the nice thing about this
choice is that if you want to

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:24.000
you can make single bonds with
this theory, and you can make

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:28.000
double bonds --

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:39.000
-- with this theory,
like that.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:49.000
And then, due to the properties
of the tetrahedron,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:35:00.000
you can also make triple bonds.
This is marvelous.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000
You can see that the famous
chemist Gilbert Newton Lewis was

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
talking about electronic
structure in terms of

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000
symmetrical things,
like tetrahedra and cubes,

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000
as a way of arranging electrons
reasonably in space.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000
This could, again,
be our iodine molecule.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:24.000
This could be,
now, our O two molecule.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:29.000
And, if we continue that
progression in the Periodic

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Table, what is this molecule?
Dinitrogen, N two,

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.000
the major component of our
atmosphere, another interesting

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000
molecule that we will be talking
about as the semester progresses

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000
forward.
But chemical language and

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
electronic structure theory are
very much still permeated with

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:03.000
this affection for symmetry and
the problems that you can solve

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:10.000
using symmetry to analyze
electronic structure theory.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Let's talk next about another
molecule because we want to talk

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:20.000
about Lewis's development of the
electron pair theory,

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:26.000
but also we want to understand
how that relates to acid-base

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
properties.
And so, let me draw here

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
another molecule.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
And when you look at this
molecule, which is the aluminum

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
trichloride molecule,
in which I am drawing out

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
explicitly all of the electrons,
not forgetting these two.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:54.000
And having drawn the aluminum
trichloride molecule

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000
and looked at it like that,
you can ask yourself is the

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000
number of electrons divisible by
eight?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Yes it is.
We have a 24 valance electron

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
system here.
It is divisible by eight.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Of course, it is also divisible
by two.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
You can also ask yourself is
this molecule,

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.000
as written, one that satisfies
the rule of eight for all four

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
of the atoms?
No.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
We have a problem there because
this thing is electron

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
deficient.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
And if you were Lewis,
you would want to know,

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000
well, if it is electron
deficient, this molecule must be

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
doing something about that to
get more electrons.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Which atom is missing
electrons, here?

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
The aluminum.
How can we give aluminum more

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000
electrons, in a structure like
this?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Can we get it up to the rule of
eight?

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Double bonds,
awesome.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Beautiful.
We can make a double bond.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
And, if we do that,
we can allow aluminum to

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000
satisfy the rule of eight,
or allow the rule of eight to

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000
satisfy aluminum.
Whichever way you want to look

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:36.000
at it.
And see what we have done,

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
here?
We have taken one of the

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
electron pairs,
say, this one,

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000
and we have moved it in between
the aluminum and the chlorine,

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
so it joins the other one in
there.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000
And we get a double bond.
And now, everybody has an

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000
octet.
But what is the problem with

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000
that?
The problem with that is that

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
chlorine is very
electronegative,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000
and it does not want its
electrons stolen away by the

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
very electropositive aluminum
center.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:21.000
There are other ways that
aluminum can ultimately satisfy

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:27.000
its octet, and this is how we
get into the realm of "Lewis

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:32.000
acid-base theory."
And I want to show you one of

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:36.000
the other ways that aluminum can
satisfy its octet,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
and then, we are going to move
to the computer so we can

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
visualize some of these
properties.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000
If I put my aluminum here --
and do you remember this

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000
molecule up here,
the ammonia molecule?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000
I am going to say that if I
draw that ammonia molecule in

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
place, here --

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
The ammonia molecule comes in,
and it has its eight electrons.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000
It is sharing six of them with
three hydrogens.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.000
The idea is that it has an
extra pair of electrons on that

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000
nitrogen in the ammonia
molecule, that it can share with

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
the aluminum.
And now we go ahead and

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
complete the picture.
And we can have eight electrons

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
around everybody.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:42.000
And so the rule of eight is now
satisfied for the three

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:46.000
chlorines, for the aluminum,
and for the nitrogen of the

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:50.000
ammonia molecule.
The ammonia molecule is what we

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000
call a "Lewis base."

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.000
And the aluminum trichloride
molecule is what we

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:08.000
call a "Lewis acid,"
for reasons that should now be

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.000
quite clear.
And I want to show you how we

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
can look at these things.
And if you will give me just a

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:22.000
second here, I am going to load
the aluminum trichloride

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
molecule up onto the screen.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
What we are going to do is
remember that there are lots of

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
different ways in which you can
visualize molecules.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
And I want to show you some of
the more interesting ways.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:33.000
All that is is a picture of the
aluminum trichloride

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:40.000
molecule with spheres drawn at
kind of arbitrary radii.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
The size of these spheres is
not representative of any

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:51.000
particular physical quantity,
but we can change that.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.000
And so now, what we are going
to do is draw the thing a

00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:02.000
slightly different way.
And what you can see is that

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:07.000
the positions of those nuclei
are in this flat box.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:13.000
I made the box kind of flat.
It is kind of a slab because

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000
this AlCl three
molecule is conveniently kind of

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
flat in its structure.
And what are we going to do

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:28.000
now?
We are going to draw a contour

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
surface.
And I like this.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
We are going to use the solid
surface method,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
first.
And can you see that now?

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
These curves that enclose the
four nuclei of the aluminum

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
trichloride molecule
do have some physical

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
significance,
because what I have done here

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
is taken results,
in this case from the quantum

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
chemistry calculation,
but you could also take it from

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
an X-ray crystallographic
structure determination study.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
And I have drawn a
three-dimensional contour map.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:11.000
The value of the electron
density at every point on the

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
surface of one of those ovaloid
shapes is the same.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Just like when you have a
contour map to describe in two

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000
dimensions an interesting
complicated surface,

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:27.000
we can do this in three
dimensions as well.

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:30.000
And one of the things you
notice, when you look at a

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000
surface like this,
is that the value of the

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
electron density actually goes
down to some low value in

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000
between the nuclei,
for this.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
When you see molecules
represented as balls and sticks,

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:47.000
or if you represent molecules
this way, just showing a pair of

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:51.000
dots between the aluminum and
chloride, you may not be getting

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:56.000
a physically complete picture of
the situation.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
You can get a much more
complete picture if you have

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
access to the actual electron
density.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
And then, you can even go a
little further,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
and I want to show you
something very cool.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000
First I am going to need to
load in a second molecule.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
And that will be the product of
the first "Lewis acid-base

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
reaction" that we have
discussed.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Because, I didn't say it over
there, but that was your first

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000
exposure to a Lewis acid-base
reaction, in which the ammonia

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000
molecule comes in and binds to
the aluminum trichloride

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:40.000
molecule,
in order to satisfy the valence

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000
requirements of the respective
atom types.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
And so, here we are going to
look at that molecule,

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000
and we are going to look at its
electron density.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
And I think you are going to
like this very much.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Here it comes.
And then I am going to

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
represent this as a solid
surface.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
The value of the electron
density everywhere on this

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
surface is 0.1 electron density
units.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000
I want you to start thinking
about how that shape appears

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:53.000
there because I am going to
underscore that a little bit

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:59.000
more in just a second.
But one thing you should notice

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
is that at the NH three
molecule, which is pictured at

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000
the top of that representation,
what you are seeing is that the

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
value of the electron density
does not get very small as you

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000
go between the nitrogen and
hydrogen nuclei because both

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000
nitrogen and hydrogen are quite
similar in electronegativity as

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000
compared with the aluminum atom
in this system.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:46.000
The fascinating thing about
illustrating a molecule in this

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:55.000
way is that we can actually
associate another property with

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:02.000
the color on the surface.
Now what we are doing is

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
looking at the aluminum
trichloride ammonia system.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.000
And let me see if I can make
this thing gradually spin,

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:15.000
so that I can talk about it
without being pinned to my

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
computer.
What we have on the surface on

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000
each of these electron density
isosurface enclosed regions is a

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000
color that corresponds with a
value of a function that tells

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.000
us about the propensity of
electrons to be paired at that

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
point in space.
The Lewis theory is now colored

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000
onto the electron density
isosurface of this Lewis acid,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Lewis base complex molecule.
And the values that correspond

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:52.000
to those regions in space where
electrons are most likely to be

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000
found paired up are colored
blue.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Where they are least likely to
be found paired up are colored

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000
kind of red-orange,
here.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
And then an intermediate color
is this green.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
And so, you can see that you
have electron pairs associated

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000
with each of the three NH bonds,
up at the top.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
You have another electron pair
here in blue,

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
which is very proximate to this
aluminum center,

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000
that is very electron deficient
as we had found right over here

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
because it lacks an octet.
And then, each of these

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000
chlorines is able to attract
electron pairs.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Because chlorine is very
electronegative,

00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:39.000
it attracts the electron pairs
to itself and sort of withholds

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000
them from the aluminum center,
but yet, that development of

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:47.000
charge separation keeps
everything together in what we

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000
can call an ionic interaction,
an electrostatic interaction.

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.000
You can see here covalent
bonding, donor-acceptor complex

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
formation, and electrostatic
contributions to bonding.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000
And all of this is just an
illustration of the brilliant

00:50:03.942 --> 00:50:06.000
ideas of Gilbert Newton Lewis.

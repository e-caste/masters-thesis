00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.910
MICHELE: Welcome
to lecture three

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.000
on quantum mechanical methods.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.300
As you may have
guessed, I'm not Jeff,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.060
as much as I look
like him, I know.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.920
I'm actually a graduate
student of his.

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.940
I'm Michele.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.580
So feel free to interrupt
me with any questions you

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.780
have during this.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.270
And this is a really exciting
class today because today,

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.270
we're actually going to
start talking about some

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.025
of the quantum methods
that we've been doing

00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:52.750
in the background up till now.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.960
So first of all, I
guess you guys know

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.860
that you don't have
class on Thursday,

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.870
but I guess for those
of you doing projects,

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.209
you can go meet with
Professor Buehler then.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:08.330
So on our outline, we are here.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.675
We're going to be talking a
little bit about modeling,

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:12.050
the beginnings of
modeling today,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.760
and a little bit
about molecules.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.350
So last time, we talked about
a single electron system.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.200
We talked about hydrogen, and
actually, that gave us a lot.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.870
We were able to explain how
spectral lines came about, just

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:31.350
from understanding the
basic structure of hydrogen.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.150
But today, we're going to
work on more-than-one electron

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.960
systems.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.850
And you'll see that this is
where the computation really

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.940
becomes necessary.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.805
So here's the outline.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.180
So you can see
today, we're going

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.305
to talk a little bit about
Hartree and Hartree-Fock

00:01:48.305 --> 00:01:52.108
methods, and density
functional theory.

00:01:52.108 --> 00:01:53.650
So I believe you
guys are going to be

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:58.690
using density functional theory
to your next problem set.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.443
So just some review
from last time--

00:02:03.443 --> 00:02:05.110
here's the Schrodinger
equation that I'm

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.949
sure you're all sick
of seeing by now.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.280
In general, if our system
is time independent,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.950
then our Hamiltonian is
going to be time independent.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.020
And we can separate
the variables

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.720
into the spatial component
and the time component.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.180
And then by dividing
out the time component,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.610
we are left with this
stationary, time-independent

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:26.232
Schrodinger equation.

00:02:26.232 --> 00:02:28.190
And that's the equation
that we've been solving

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.950
and we will continue to solve.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.320
So as I said, last time we
talked about the hydrogen atom.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.050
We just solved its Hamiltonian.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.380
The Hamiltonian itself is,
of course, the kinetic energy

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.490
and the potential energy.

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.790
The kinetic energy is this.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.940
The potential energy is actually
just that Coulomb attraction

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.690
between the electron and the
proton in that hydrogen atom.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.490
And this, we saw, was
pretty simple to solve.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:04.340
I guess we didn't actually do
it, but the way this is solved

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.380
is you switch into
spherical coordinates.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.730
You solve for a radial
component of the wave function,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.430
and an angular component
of the wave function.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.760
So to any of you who have
had a lot of chemistry,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.990
these probably
look very familiar.

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:28.390
So this is the s, these three
are p, these five are d.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.780
And these are basically
just the spherical harmonics

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.170
that you get from
solving the theta and phi

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.000
parts of the Hamiltonian.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.540
And when we combine these,
we get the total spatial wave

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.250
function for the hydrogen atom.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.440
So the spatial wave
function is described

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.540
by these quantum numbers.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.710
And the principle quantum
number, l, the angular momentum

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.370
component, and m l, which is
the angular momentum component,

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.240
projected along the z axis.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.910
So you guys have probably
seen these a million times--

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.900
that leads to these
spatial wave functions.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.780
So this is increasing
principal quantum number

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:15.880
and this is increasing
angular momentum.

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.579
All right, so we've all
seen this graph now a couple

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:22.240
of times.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.502
Can somebody tell me what
this graph represents?

00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:35.185
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:35.810
MICHELE: Right.

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:41.752
And why is it important that
there are these specific lines

00:04:41.752 --> 00:04:42.710
that it can go between?

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:49.172
I mean, what phenomenon are
we capturing with this idea?

00:04:49.172 --> 00:04:52.620
AUDIENCE: We can [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.140
MICHELE: Right.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.440
So this is why people
observed spectral lines

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.600
instead of seeing a
continuous spectrum.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.380
and so atoms, instead of
emitting a continuous spectrum,

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.390
emit specific lines.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.170
And that puzzle was solved by--

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:15.380
we actually already solved it
last time with the solution

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.620
to the hydrogen atom, because we
saw that the hydrogen atom had

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.690
these discrete energy levels.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.780
And electrons could only
exist in those specific energy

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:24.570
levels.

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.990
And so when an electron went
between those two energy

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:31.400
levels, it would emit the
energy of that difference

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.250
in energy levels as a photon.

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.090
And that photon would
be a specific wavelength

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:39.650
corresponding to
a specific color,

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.900
and that's exactly
where this emission line

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:42.760
spectrum comes from.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.240
So let's try to add
one more electron.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.450
So this is our Hamiltonian
now for helium.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:58.550
We still have the kinetic part,
the T for electrons 1 and 2.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.540
We have the potential part
for electrons 1 and 2.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:07.460
That's the interaction of
the electrons with the helium

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.880
nucleus.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.660
But now we have this term
that's the Coulomb repulsion.

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.410
It's the two electrons
interacting with each other.

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.900
And this makes the
problem suddenly

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.420
unable to be solved
analytically,

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.030
just this addition
of one more electron.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.230
I guess you could think of it as
sort of the three-body problem

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.530
in classical mechanics.

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:33.870
So last time, we also
talked about spin.

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:39.310
So we know that electrons are
either spin up or spin down.

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.265
Does anybody remember
the experiment

00:06:42.265 --> 00:06:43.390
that was done to show this?

00:06:46.126 --> 00:06:48.410
AUDIENCE: Stern-Gerlach.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.390
MICHELE: Yeah, good job.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:56.832
So the Stern-Gerlach
experiment, basically it

00:06:56.832 --> 00:06:58.290
was a stream of
electrons that were

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.930
shot through this magnetic
field and then were

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.310
observed on a plate behind it.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.430
So electrons being shot
through this magnetic field

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.720
is kind of like the spin
component of the wave function

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.140
being observed.

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.010
So now that we're observing
this wave function,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:18.660
it can only be in
its eigenstates.

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.030
So those eigenstates
are here and here.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:25.940
So you think if you
have an electron that

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:28.580
can interact with
a magnetic field,

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.370
its magnetic moment could be
pointing sort of any direction.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:35.660
So if it's pointing
perpendicular

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.438
to the magnetic
field, why would you

00:07:37.438 --> 00:07:39.230
expect there to be any
kind of interaction?

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:42.200
You just expect it to end
up in the middle here.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.740
And similarly, it could be
anywhere between up or down.

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:50.060
But this is quantum mechanics.

00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:53.030
This magnetic field is
making a measurement.

00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:56.017
And so we all know that
once a measurement is

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:57.850
made in quantum mechanics,
the wave function

00:07:57.850 --> 00:08:01.820
collapses to one of its
observable eigenstates.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:07.970
So it may seem strange to you
that if you know something

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:11.645
about where magnetic moments
usually come from, usually

00:08:11.645 --> 00:08:15.140
we talk about magnetic fields
being produced by electrons

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.060
physically spinning in space.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.430
But this is just some
property of an electron

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.660
that creates a magnetic moment,
without any kind of movement.

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.970
So that's still something
that we don't really

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:29.180
understand today, what
exactly that spin means.

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.900
But we observe it and
it seems necessary,

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:37.669
so right now, all we can say is
that we know electrons either

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:39.020
spin up or they're spin down.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.960
And Jeff showed you
last time this letter

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.010
to Pauli about
how even Pauli was

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:53.340
a little skeptical of
this spin quantum number,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.440
but it's actually crucial
for his exclusion principle.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.956
So does anybody remember the
Pauli exclusion principle?

00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:06.170
Yeah.

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.730
MICHELE: Exactly.

00:09:11.730 --> 00:09:17.270
So all the electrons
have to have--

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.740
all four quantum
numbers have to be

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.972
different between any
pair of electrons.

00:09:20.972 --> 00:09:22.430
So the four quantum
numbers, again,

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.690
are the three
spatial components,

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:25.523
and now we've added one
more, which is spin.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:32.620
Pauli himself said, "Already
in my original paper

00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.270
I stressed the
circumstance that I

00:09:34.270 --> 00:09:36.910
was unable to give a logical
reason for the exclusion

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.870
principle or to deduce it
from more general assumptions.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.120
I had always the feeling,
and I still have it today,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.810
that this is a deficiency."

00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:47.110
So Pauli came up with this.

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.200
He used it.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.140
It explained the periodic
table, but he had no idea

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:55.340
why this had to be true.

00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.670
And doesn't it bother you
guys that there's just

00:09:58.670 --> 00:10:00.860
this arbitrary rule
that we're saying

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:04.010
no two electrons can have the
same four quantum numbers?

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:06.620
Well, today, we're actually
going to explain this.

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.540
We're going to explain
what Pauli could not.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.560
So let's move on to
new stuff, unless there

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.870
are any questions so far.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.030
OK, so today, we're
going to be talking

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.100
about what happens
when we have more

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.790
than one electron in a system.

00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:27.750
So we could be
talking about helium

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:31.680
with two electrons,
iron, 26 electrons.

00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.370
We'll move up to molecules,
solids, things with 100s,

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:39.310
1,000s of electrons.

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:43.790
Dirac said in 1929, "The
underlying physical laws

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:45.620
necessary for the
mathematical theory

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:47.960
of a large part of physics
and the whole of chemistry

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.480
are thus completely
known, and the difficulty

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:56.990
is only that the exact
application of these laws

00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:59.580
leads to equations much too
complicated to be soluble."

00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.120
So basically, he was
feeling pretty cocky here.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.615
It's like we understand
the theory of everything.

00:11:04.615 --> 00:11:05.990
We understand the
periodic table.

00:11:05.990 --> 00:11:07.760
There's nothing left
to do in chemistry.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.830
We understand now.

00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.080
We can write the equations
for how all molecules work,

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.000
how all solids work.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.460
And it's the complication of
these mathematical formulas

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.390
that turned out
to be the problem.

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:26.270
So many years later, he still
was struggling with these.

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:28.700
And he says, "If there's
no complete agreement

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.310
between the results of one's
work and the experiment,

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:34.170
one should not allow himself
to be too discouraged."

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.180
So even after all
this time struggling

00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:38.930
to solve this equation,
he still could not

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:40.110
agree with experiment.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.610
And even today, we still cannot
always agree with experiment,

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.870
but that's no reason not to try.

00:11:45.870 --> 00:11:50.030
So this was our
basic Hamiltonian

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:54.620
that we had for just
the hydrogen system.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:59.440
It was just the kinetic
and potential energy.

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.880
It's as simple as that.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:06.640
Well, now our equation looks
a little bit more like this.

00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.990
So I don't want you to be too
intimidated by this equation.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.800
It seems to have a
lot of terms in it,

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.700
so let's go through
them for a simple case.

00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:21.190
So let's say we'd
have the simplest

00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.330
molecule you can think of, H2.

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:29.170
So let's say you have a
nucleus here, nucleus here,

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:32.530
and an electron that
originally was associated

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.920
with this one, and
another electron

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.740
originally associated with this.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:40.570
So what are these terms
in the Hamiltonian?

00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:42.110
So what do we need to consider?

00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:47.480
So this first term here
is the kinetic energy

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:49.280
of the nuclei themselves.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.290
So it's how this nucleus and
this nucleus are moving around.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.980
So in this very
simple case, we'd

00:12:54.980 --> 00:12:58.040
have two terms in this sum.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.410
This next is the interaction
[? C-C ?] of Z i and a Z j.

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:06.650
So it's the interaction of
the nuclei with each other.

00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:11.010
It's the Coulomb repulsion
of nucleus 1 and nucleus 2.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:15.150
So in this case, that's
actually just one term.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:20.800
This next term is the kinetic
energy of the electrons.

00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.130
So it's, in this
case, two terms.

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:26.490
We have electron 1 and electron
2 that are zooming around,

00:13:26.490 --> 00:13:29.710
and that's their kinetic energy.

00:13:29.710 --> 00:13:32.310
The next term is
there's only one Z,

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:36.640
so it's the interaction of
the nucleus and the electrons.

00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:39.660
So here, we have four
of those interactions.

00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:42.810
We have electron 1 interacting
with nucleus 1 and 2,

00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:46.870
electron 2 interacting
with nucleus 1 and 2.

00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:50.780
And finally, we have electrons
interacting with themselves,

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:54.980
so the Coulomb
repulsion of electrons.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.920
So in this case, again,
there's just one term

00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:58.660
because there are
only two electrons.

00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:08.100
So I think all of these
terms are labeled properly.

00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:11.910
So our equation now has
become rather complicated.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:13.980
Instead of just
having one coordinate,

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:17.520
which was the relative
coordinate between the nucleus

00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.640
and the electron that we
had in the hydrogen case,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.280
now we have this
Hamiltonian that

00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:25.470
depends on the position
of all the nuclei

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:27.120
and the position of
all the electrons,

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.470
and our wave
function that depends

00:14:28.470 --> 00:14:30.803
on the position of all the
nuclei and all the electrons.

00:14:30.803 --> 00:14:34.450
So this has become a massively
complicated equation.

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:40.420
So at this point, what
are we going to do?

00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.790
You might think to
yourself that you're stuck,

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.430
that this equation
is too complicated.

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:46.840
You'll never get anywhere.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:51.580
And just as you're
despairing, this man walks in,

00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.003
pulls down the
back of his shirt.

00:14:53.003 --> 00:14:55.420
Might take you a little while
to stare at these equations,

00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.650
because you'll recognize this as
being the equation we just had.

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:04.420
And he's giving you the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:07.470
So let's look at
this approximation,

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:10.140
maybe not on somebody's back.

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:17.610
So Born was a pretty
foundational guy

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.530
in quantum mechanics.

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:20.370
He did a lot of work
in quantum mechanics.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:26.010
And I'm sure you all recognize
the name Oppenheimer.

00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.350
So these two guys, what
they decided to do,

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:34.280
they looked at this picture,
and they thought about the fact

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:41.240
that a proton is 2,000 times
the mass of an electron.

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.280
And so because this
electron is so heavy,

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.370
it's just moving so
slowly with respect

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.470
to these electrons that
are zipping around.

00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:51.660
And so basically, what
they decided to do

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.790
is just ignore that
motion of the nucleons.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:59.528
So the nuclei are moving so
much slower than the electrons

00:15:59.528 --> 00:16:02.070
that basically, you can assume
that the electrons will figure

00:16:02.070 --> 00:16:04.445
out their ground state, figure
out where they need to be,

00:16:04.445 --> 00:16:07.590
by the time any kind
of nucleus has moved

00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:11.010
even a fraction of an Angstrom.

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:14.790
So because we're now
neglecting the kinetic energy

00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.990
of the nucleons, we
can also just calculate

00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.590
the ion-ion interaction
classically.

00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:26.912
So that really simplifies
our Hamiltonian.

00:16:26.912 --> 00:16:28.870
So now, we're just left
with these three terms.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.950
So it's the kinetic
energy of the electrons

00:16:31.950 --> 00:16:39.450
only, the interactions of the
electrons with the background

00:16:39.450 --> 00:16:40.920
positive charge--

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.630
so where the ions are--

00:16:42.630 --> 00:16:45.140
and the interaction of the
electrons with themselves.

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:51.360
So we're from now
on, we're mostly

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:55.350
going to call this term just
the "external potential," so

00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:58.500
"external" because we
don't care about the motion

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:02.230
of these nuclei anymore.

00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.150
So this leads us to
actually starting

00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:09.030
to talk about how we do
these approximations.

00:17:09.030 --> 00:17:12.510
So traditionally, there
have been two pathways

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.750
that have been followed.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:16.980
There's what a lot of
quantum chemists have taken,

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.670
and we'll talk about that
first, but there's also

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:24.180
density functional theory, which
is what a lot of physicists

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.017
have traditionally used.

00:17:26.017 --> 00:17:28.600
And I'm not going to talk about
either of these two in detail.

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:32.670
But I'll just mention, the
Moller-Plesset perturbation

00:17:32.670 --> 00:17:35.220
theory is a perturbation
theory. so it's

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:39.650
based on changing
the Hamiltonian,

00:17:39.650 --> 00:17:42.240
so assuming that the Hamiltonian
is pretty much something

00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.830
we can solve, and
then just adding

00:17:43.830 --> 00:17:46.110
a small correction to it.

00:17:46.110 --> 00:17:48.300
And the coupled
cluster approach is

00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:51.570
more of a traditional quantum
chemistry approach, where

00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:53.670
instead of modifying
the Hamiltonian,

00:17:53.670 --> 00:17:55.410
we just modify the
wave functions.

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:58.330
And we play around
with the wave functions

00:17:58.330 --> 00:18:02.680
until they become something
that's more close to something

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:05.230
that would exist in reality.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:10.250
So let's talk about the basis of
the quantum chemistry approach.

00:18:10.250 --> 00:18:12.370
So this is Hartree.

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:15.280
He was working right
after World War

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:18.730
I. I think this was
actually his dissertation,

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:24.230
and he got his PhD for doing
this very important work.

00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:28.113
So what he decided is
we have this system

00:18:28.113 --> 00:18:29.030
that we want to solve.

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.700
We have a wave
function that's made up

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:35.000
of all of these electrons that
are zooming around in space.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.990
Well, what if that kind
of acted like a bunch

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.800
of one-electron wave functions?

00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.770
What if we could
just assume that we

00:18:41.770 --> 00:18:44.710
could know where one electron
was, and another electron was,

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.500
and we just could just multiply
all those together to give us

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.430
the total wave function?

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:53.480
So all of a sudden, this really
complicated wave function

00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.150
becomes something that's
pretty easy to separate.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:02.100
So because we can
separate them like this,

00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.880
we can separate them into a set
of-- so if we have electrons 1

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.260
through n, we'll have
a set of Schrodinger

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:16.060
equations 1 through n, for
each electron by itself.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.290
So this is great.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:19.770
We've separated our Hamiltonian.

00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:22.490
We now can solve
the system, right?

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:25.060
So there is a problem here.

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:34.720
This is the density
of electron j.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.830
We're doing a sum over j
from electron 1 through n,

00:19:38.830 --> 00:19:40.780
and just skipping the
electron that we're

00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.420
considering in this case.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.830
So all of us is saying
this electron that we'd

00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:47.050
like to solve depends
on the positions

00:19:47.050 --> 00:19:49.670
of every single other
electron in that system.

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:53.800
So even in this most simplified
version of the Schrodinger

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.010
equation, we still
have the one electron

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:59.240
depending on all of
the other electrons.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.862
So how do we solve
something like this?

00:20:02.862 --> 00:20:03.570
Do you guys know?

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.830
I think this is even a little
more complicated than something

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:11.658
Mathematica can solve.

00:20:11.658 --> 00:20:13.060
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.070
MICHELE: Pretty much.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:28.010
Well-- what we do is we try
a self-consistent approach.

00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.940
We basically just guess what
these wave functions look like.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:35.180
We say, well in
this case, we know

00:20:35.180 --> 00:20:38.750
that it's a sigma bond that's
forming between these two,

00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:43.380
so probably the electron
is somewhere in here.

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.100
And so if I guess some
structure that looks something

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:50.590
like this is my wave
function, that's

00:20:50.590 --> 00:20:52.110
maybe a good starting point.

00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:56.870
And so we put input
that into this equation.

00:20:56.870 --> 00:20:59.048
We take out the first
electron, and we're

00:20:59.048 --> 00:21:00.840
going to now solve the
Schrodinger equation

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.200
for the first electron.

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:07.950
So we plug in what
we've guessed as being

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:11.370
the wave functions for all the
other electrons into this term.

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:14.670
And now we solve for
this one electron term,

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:16.140
for electron number 1.

00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:18.450
And then we do that
again for electron 2,

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:21.065
and so on until we've gone
through all of the electrons.

00:21:21.065 --> 00:21:22.440
And then when
we're done, we have

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.720
a new set of wave functions.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:27.570
So maybe my guess was wrong
and it looks something more

00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:30.020
like this.

00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:32.220
And so we look at
that, and say, wow,

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.980
those two really don't look
anything like each other.

00:21:34.980 --> 00:21:36.610
I need to try this again.

00:21:36.610 --> 00:21:38.460
And so we go
through this process

00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:41.290
over and over again
until finally,

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:47.820
the solutions to these wave
functions prior to doing this

00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.950
and after going
through and solving

00:21:49.950 --> 00:21:54.960
all of these eigenfunctions
look pretty much the same.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:57.690
And once we've
done that, we know

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:00.750
that we've probably gotten
something at least relatively

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:03.330
close to the ground-state
solution, or the solution

00:22:03.330 --> 00:22:05.530
that we're looking for.

00:22:05.530 --> 00:22:07.440
So does that make
sense to you guys?

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.773
Are there any questions?

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.010
OK, because this is actually
pretty close to how DFT works,

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:17.510
too.

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:19.370
This is the
self-consistent method

00:22:19.370 --> 00:22:24.960
that is pretty common in
solving these problems.

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.120
So this is great.

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.740
We have a way of doing this.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:30.500
Given that we can come up
with some reasonable guess

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.630
for our input wave
functions, we now

00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:35.380
can solve the Schrodinger
equation, right?

00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:39.660
Yes and no.

00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.410
This picture is nice
and simple and soluble,

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:47.520
but it takes out all
of the interactions

00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:49.020
that you get, or
all of the effects

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:50.770
that you get from
interactions beyond just

00:22:50.770 --> 00:22:52.980
that coulomb repulsion, of
electron-electron Coulomb

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:53.710
repulsion.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.088
Because remember, this
is a quantum system.

00:22:56.088 --> 00:22:57.630
These electrons
don't behave like you

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:02.880
expect they would in some kind
of classical Newtonian system.

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.730
These electrons are weird.

00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:12.870
We'll see later on some of the
symmetries that we can look at.

00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:15.570
Actually, I think that's next.

00:23:15.570 --> 00:23:17.280
But these electrons--
you wouldn't

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.475
expect to just be able
to just average over all

00:23:22.475 --> 00:23:23.100
of the effects.

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:27.600
Because this truly was a
multi-electron function.

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.610
We're missing some
critical physics here

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.630
by just separating it out
into single electron functions

00:23:33.630 --> 00:23:36.220
and just multiplying
those back together.

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:41.672
So we're missing
two important terms.

00:23:41.672 --> 00:23:43.380
They're going to be
called the "exchange"

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.670
and the "correlation" term.

00:23:44.670 --> 00:23:47.790
And the fix to at least
part of this problem

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:50.860
brings us back to spin.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:55.030
So as I said, in
quantum mechanics,

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.490
symmetry is really,
really important.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:02.890
Symmetry tells us a lot
about the way nature works.

00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:04.570
So even in classical
mechanics, you guys

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:10.630
have probably encountered
the symmetry of real space,

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.880
the symmetry of time,
things like that.

00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:18.490
And that's what gives you the
conservation laws in mechanics.

00:24:18.490 --> 00:24:21.480
So just like that's
true in mechanics,

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.650
it's also true in
quantum mechanics.

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:26.850
So we're going to be looking
at one particular symmetry,

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.520
and talking about how
that might give us

00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.050
some insight into this problem.

00:24:32.050 --> 00:24:35.120
So that symmetry is called
"exchange symmetry."

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:38.520
So that's based on the
fact that electrons

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.650
are indistinguishable.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:46.250
So what does it mean to be
really indistinguishable?

00:24:46.250 --> 00:24:52.390
So if I have, maybe, two
pieces of chalk that look--

00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:53.950
I guess they're not
exactly the same,

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:56.710
but they look pretty similar.

00:24:56.710 --> 00:24:59.560
And let's say I want to follow--

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.080
I'm going to call this one
Fred and this one George.

00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.810
And I'm going to follow their
movement throughout space.

00:25:04.810 --> 00:25:07.240
So if I give them
an initial position

00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.950
and some initial velocity,
I know throughout all time

00:25:10.950 --> 00:25:12.700
which one is Fred and
which one is George.

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.980
Because I knew their
exact initial position.

00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:16.960
I knew their exact
initial velocity.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.430
I can calculate
their trajectories.

00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:20.600
I know which one is which.

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:23.710
But that's not
true for electrons.

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:27.160
So does anybody know the
uncertainty principle?

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:31.030
Can somebody tell me what
the uncertainty principle is?

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:31.530
Yeah.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:37.634
Did you volunteer?

00:25:37.634 --> 00:25:39.580
AUDIENCE: No, I didn't.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:43.840
I [INAUDIBLE]
algebraic [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:46.080
MICHELE: Right.

00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:47.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:50.060 --> 00:25:53.250
MICHELE: Right, so the exact
mathematical formulation

00:25:53.250 --> 00:25:57.090
is something like the
uncertainty in the momentum

00:25:57.090 --> 00:25:58.920
times the uncertainty
in the position

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.252
has to be always greater
than or equal to basically

00:26:02.252 --> 00:26:02.835
some constant.

00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:11.570
So if I have my two
starting electrons,

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:13.940
and I have some idea
of where it starts,

00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:17.390
and with some idea of what
velocity it starts with,

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:22.190
and some other electron-- with
similarly not an exact position

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.440
but some kind of position
and some kind of knowledge

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:26.960
of the velocity--

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.150
it's clear that over
time, I'm going to have

00:26:29.150 --> 00:26:31.040
no idea which one was which.

00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:33.380
They'll switch and I won't
be able to tell that they've

00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:36.050
switched because I can't follow
their trajectories the same way

00:26:36.050 --> 00:26:39.460
I can with classical objects.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.128
And furthermore, electrons don't
have any identifying marks.

00:26:43.128 --> 00:26:45.670
They don't have like a beauty
mark somewhere that can tell us

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:47.470
which one was the
electron that we really

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.510
fell in love with first.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:56.078
And so electrons act
completely indistinguishable.

00:26:56.078 --> 00:26:58.120
And so this is a symmetry
we're going to exploit.

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:07.050
So let's say we have a
system full of electrons,

00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:08.580
and I pull a curtain
in front of you

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:10.230
so you can't see
the system anymore.

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.420
I take one electron, and
I take another electron,

00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:13.770
and I swap them exactly.

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:16.140
I swap their positions,
I swap their momentum,

00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.660
I swap everything about them.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.420
And I open that
curtain again, you

00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:24.060
won't be able to tell at all
that anything's happened,

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.290
because these electrons act
exactly like each other.

00:27:26.290 --> 00:27:29.130
So it doesn't matter if I
swapped one with another.

00:27:29.130 --> 00:27:32.820
So this might sound
a little bit dumb.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.750
I mean, you might be
sitting there thinking,

00:27:34.750 --> 00:27:35.670
OK, this is obvious.

00:27:35.670 --> 00:27:41.100
Why is she going on so long
about something so obvious?

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:44.070
And the reason is
when we formalize

00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:47.310
this in terms of
mathematics, suddenly

00:27:47.310 --> 00:27:50.760
things become
really interesting.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.900
So we're going to define
an exchange operator, which

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.660
is this chi 1 2.

00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:59.720
So chi 1 2 acting
on a system that

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:04.820
has an electron 1 and electron
2, all it's going to do

00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.150
is swap electron
1 with electron 2.

00:28:08.150 --> 00:28:11.750
Just so this
formalism makes sense,

00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.980
this 1 refers to what
particular wave function it is.

00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.750
So this psi 1 refers to that
set of four quantum numbers,

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:23.990
or set of whatever quantum
numbers describes that system.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:27.050
And similarly, psi 2
describes a different set

00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:31.340
of quantum numbers, and r1 is
the position of electron 1, r2

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:32.870
is the position of electron 2.

00:28:37.070 --> 00:28:41.700
So when we use this exchange
operator on our system,

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.440
we get something that
should be indistinguishable.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.210
And you can see that
if we act twice--

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.450
so if we have electron 1
and 2, and we swap them,

00:28:51.450 --> 00:28:53.450
and then we act again
with the exchange operator

00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:56.240
and we swap 1 and 2,
we'll switch back.

00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:04.070
So we know mathematically that
this exchange operator, acted

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:06.717
twice on a system,
leaves you exactly

00:29:06.717 --> 00:29:08.300
with the original
system that you had.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:16.940
So we have to assume
here that this wave

00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:20.060
function is going to be an
eigenstate of the exchange

00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:20.900
operator.

00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:25.430
And there is a quantum
mechanical reason for that.

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:29.930
But what this tells us,
assuming that we've now

00:29:29.930 --> 00:29:32.090
acted with this
exchange operator twice,

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:36.590
we know that the value of the
eigenvalue of the exchange

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:40.180
operator squared is
equal to 1, which

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.520
gives us that the
eigenvalue itself

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.840
has to be plus or minus 1.

00:29:47.782 --> 00:29:49.240
So just to be clear,
what I've said

00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:56.050
is that when I act
on this wave function

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:58.310
with this exchange operator--

00:29:58.310 --> 00:30:03.370
so I have my total
wave function, whatever

00:30:03.370 --> 00:30:07.790
it is, which is a function
of multiple electrons,

00:30:07.790 --> 00:30:12.310
when I act with this
exchange operator on it,

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:18.760
I get something where
I've switched r1 and r2,

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.410
and all the other electrons
are left the same.

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.200
And what I said in
the previous slide

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.680
is that these two states--

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:29.540
this state and this state--
have to act exactly the same.

00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:35.500
But now I've also
told you that this

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:47.290
is equal to some eigenfunction
times the original wave

00:30:47.290 --> 00:30:48.190
function.

00:30:48.190 --> 00:30:51.460
And this eigenfunction, I've
said, can be negative 1.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:58.590
So can anybody
reconcile this for me?

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:02.850
How can this eigenfunction
be negative and yet

00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.610
have this original
eigenstate not be changed,

00:31:05.610 --> 00:31:12.660
or have no measurable
difference between the electrons

00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:15.810
being in the original positions
or 1 and 2 being switched?

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:43.840
So the key to the question
is actually the term

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.780
"measurable difference."

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:51.370
So remember, Jeff has said
that in quantum mechanics,

00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:52.890
we have this wave function.

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:55.140
We have no idea what the
wave function actually means.

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.598
It's the square, the absolute
value square of the function,

00:31:57.598 --> 00:31:59.170
that actually is meaningful.

00:31:59.170 --> 00:32:02.598
So you can see, even if
this is a negative 1,

00:32:02.598 --> 00:32:04.890
and we have a negative 1 in
front of the wave function,

00:32:04.890 --> 00:32:08.050
when we square that, the
negative is going to disappear.

00:32:08.050 --> 00:32:12.690
So we still have this symmetry
because the thing that's

00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:16.230
measurable is the absolute value
squared of the wave function,

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:19.140
and not the wave
function itself.

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:24.070
But this is actually a pretty
key piece of quantum mechanics.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:29.130
So we have two possible
values for this wave function.

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:32.610
So this wave function
can be positive 1

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:33.720
or it can be negative 1.

00:32:42.740 --> 00:32:46.180
So any quantum
mechanical system is

00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:48.820
going to have a wave
function that either

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:52.947
has the eigenvalue for
this equation positive 1

00:32:52.947 --> 00:32:53.530
or negative 1.

00:32:53.530 --> 00:32:57.790
When it's positive 1,
we call them "bosons."

00:32:57.790 --> 00:33:01.150
So this leads to a lot
of interesting physics,

00:33:01.150 --> 00:33:03.020
like the Bose-Einstein
condensate,

00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:05.020
which I don't know if you
guys have heard about.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.480
There's a lot of
cool experiments

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.760
that have been done
on helium 4, where

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:13.180
at a low enough temperature,
all of the helium atoms

00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:16.210
suddenly find themselves in
exactly the same ground state.

00:33:16.210 --> 00:33:22.220
And there's some really
bizarre consequences of that.

00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:24.370
However, what
we're interested in

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.760
are the particles with
an eigenvalue of minus 1.

00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:30.130
Those are called "fermions."

00:33:30.130 --> 00:33:31.750
Electrons are fermions.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:33.790
So electrons,
therefore, need to have

00:33:33.790 --> 00:33:36.040
an eigenvalue of negative 1.

00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.950
And this is actually the key to
the Pauli exclusion principle.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:44.120
So this is why the Pauli
exclusion principle is true.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:46.630
So can somebody
explain to me that?

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:49.570
It's kind of a subtle point.

00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:50.620
Does anybody see that?

00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:12.340
So let's look at a
wave function that

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:14.260
doesn't follow the Pauli
exclusion principle

00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:15.469
and see what happens.

00:34:15.469 --> 00:34:19.570
So let's say I
have two electrons.

00:34:19.570 --> 00:34:24.929
I'm going to put them both
in the 1s with spin up.

00:34:24.929 --> 00:34:32.989
So what happens when I
operate with this exchange

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.340
operator on this?

00:34:48.670 --> 00:34:52.630
So these two are
exactly the same.

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:57.480
So I needed a negative 1
here, but I have a positive 1.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:04.860
So because this exchange
gives me the wrong sign,

00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:08.070
I know anything that has
some system like this, where

00:35:08.070 --> 00:35:11.520
I have the same quantum numbers
on two different particles,

00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:16.110
has to be a boson
and not a fermion.

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:19.770
So let me just give you an
example of a wave function

00:35:19.770 --> 00:35:26.530
that does satisfy the
proper eigenstate for this.

00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:29.670
So if we have something
like 1 over root

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:39.860
2 1s up for particle 1,
1s down for particle 2,

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:47.810
minus 1s down for particle 1
times 1s up for particle 2.

00:35:54.230 --> 00:35:55.340
So can everybody see?

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:58.760
If I switch 1 and 2, I'm going
to get the negative of this.

00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:02.450
Because these two are going to
switch and become this term,

00:36:02.450 --> 00:36:06.830
these two are going to
switch and become this term.

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:07.550
Is that clear?

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:13.720
I'm seeing a lot of blank faces.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:17.200
I hope that means that
people are way past this

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:21.010
and have mastered this long ago.

00:36:21.010 --> 00:36:22.440
Are there any questions on this?

00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:35.430
To me, this is really exciting.

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:38.180
This is great to be able to
finally explain something

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:40.270
that Paul himself
couldn't explain.

00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:44.770
We actually can understand
quantum mechanically

00:36:44.770 --> 00:36:47.840
why electrons behave
the way they do,

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:49.590
why we have the Pauli
exclusion principle,

00:36:49.590 --> 00:36:51.540
and therefore, why we
have the periodic table.

00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:56.500
I mean, this is a
pretty big consequence.

00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.350
[DOOR CLOSING]

00:36:59.350 --> 00:37:03.310
I guess it was so big,
he couldn't take it.

00:37:03.310 --> 00:37:12.360
All right, let's move on to
what the implication of this

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.160
is in the Hartree method.

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.730
So a guy named Fock
came along, and he

00:37:17.730 --> 00:37:20.520
has either a very fortunate
or very unfortunate name,

00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:23.280
depending on how
you feel about him.

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:27.570
And he basically just took an
anti-symmetrized wave function.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:30.600
So anti-symmetrized just
means this characteristic,

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:34.050
that when you act upon
it with this operator,

00:37:34.050 --> 00:37:37.080
you get a negative 1.

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.980
So he just put in an
anti-symmetrizied wave function

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.745
into Hartree's original
equation, which was just,

00:37:44.745 --> 00:37:45.870
if you remember, just this.

00:37:45.870 --> 00:37:51.900
It's the kinetic part
and then from the ions,

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:54.370
the potential part from
the other electrons.

00:37:54.370 --> 00:37:56.700
So this was the
original equation.

00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:59.730
And when he plugged in an
anti-symmetrized wave function,

00:37:59.730 --> 00:38:03.600
suddenly, this term appeared.

00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:07.590
So this is the term we
call the "exchange term."

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:09.870
If you look very
closely at it, you'll

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:15.310
see that what it does
is quantum mechanically,

00:38:15.310 --> 00:38:17.160
two electrons with the
same spin will never

00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:18.160
be in the same position.

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:22.060
And it basically subtracts
out that possibility,

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.950
of two electrons with the same
spin being in the same place.

00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:29.590
So this actually reduces
the energy of the system

00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:33.160
because suddenly, all electrons
with the same spin have

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.630
to be just a little bit
farther apart from each other.

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:38.320
So that minimizes the Coulomb
interaction just a little bit.

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.410
So actually, with
this correction,

00:38:44.410 --> 00:38:47.830
the results seem to come and
match up with experiments

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:49.150
a lot closer.

00:38:49.150 --> 00:38:51.280
And this is actually
the foundation

00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:53.170
for molecular orbital theory.

00:38:53.170 --> 00:38:58.375
So just by adding this spin
consideration into the Hartree

00:38:58.375 --> 00:39:00.250
equation, we suddenly
have an equation that's

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:03.610
actually pretty functional.

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.680
So Jeff thinks this is
quite an emotional moment.

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:15.600
However, as I said, there
were two energy terms

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:19.360
that we were missing in that
original Hartree equation.

00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.660
So we found the exchange
term, but we're still

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:25.080
missing the correlation term.

00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:27.145
So there are some ways
to deal with this,

00:39:27.145 --> 00:39:29.520
but I think the way we're
going to deal with this is just

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.920
by moving on to DFT.

00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:34.950
So now, we're going to start
talking about DFT, which

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:37.500
I think is what you
guys are mostly using,

00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.885
so you might find
this more interesting.

00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.990
So the Schrodinger equation
is just really hard

00:39:48.990 --> 00:39:51.420
to solve with all
of these electrons.

00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.570
As we've said, it
takes a lot of time.

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.890
It takes a lot of
computational expense.

00:39:58.890 --> 00:40:03.633
So let's divide space into the
worst grid you could imagine.

00:40:03.633 --> 00:40:05.175
I guess the worst
would be one point,

00:40:05.175 --> 00:40:08.760
but the worst grid you can
imagine is 2 by 2 by 2.

00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:14.710
And let's think about
the number of points

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:17.920
that we need to keep track of
if we're calculating something

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:21.070
with little n electrons.

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.210
So if you only have one
electron, it's only eight,

00:40:26.210 --> 00:40:29.030
and it's not too bad
to keep track of.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.910
If we go up all the
way to 1,000 electrons,

00:40:30.910 --> 00:40:32.890
suddenly we have this
huge number of points

00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.180
that we have to keep track of.

00:40:34.180 --> 00:40:38.180
And that's just inconceivable,
even with today's computers.

00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:39.970
Why try to do
something this big?

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:42.670
That would take forever.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:44.700
So it'd be really
nice if we could

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:48.810
think about some other
aspect of the system

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:51.660
that we could calculate,
instead of keeping

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.527
track of every single one of
those electrons separately.

00:40:58.510 --> 00:41:02.230
And a term like that is density.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:04.800
So if we consider
density instead,

00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.417
suddenly, it's pretty
much the same scaling

00:41:07.417 --> 00:41:09.000
no matter how many
electrons you have.

00:41:12.460 --> 00:41:16.850
So the electron
density definitely

00:41:16.850 --> 00:41:18.770
seems to be a lot more
manageable than dealing

00:41:18.770 --> 00:41:21.150
with each electron separately.

00:41:21.150 --> 00:41:25.400
And so at some point,
someone's, like, well,

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:26.900
wouldn't it be nice
if we could just

00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:29.510
calculate with density instead
of with wave functions?

00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:31.460
Because think about it--
these wave functions

00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.418
don't mean anything anyway
until you've squared

00:41:33.418 --> 00:41:34.758
them to get the density.

00:41:34.758 --> 00:41:36.800
That's the only thing that
we can measure anyway.

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.680
Why don't we just
look at the density?

00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.270
So what if I could come up
with a function of energy that

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.440
was dependent on the
density of electrons?

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:52.680
And Walter Kohn actually won
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry

00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.490
in 1998 with somebody else
for coming up with this idea.

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:04.070
So as I said, one reason
that we want to go to DFT--

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:08.270
it scales so much better than
the quantum chemistry methods.

00:42:08.270 --> 00:42:11.480
And we're going to have to spend
so much less time, especially

00:42:11.480 --> 00:42:13.030
as the systems get larger.

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:15.840
So let's look at an example.

00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:19.520
So if we have two
atoms of silicon,

00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:23.870
DFT and the two sample
quantum chemistry

00:42:23.870 --> 00:42:26.300
codes all take about
the same amount of time.

00:42:26.300 --> 00:42:28.940
If we try to calculate
100 atoms of silicon,

00:42:28.940 --> 00:42:31.980
suddenly DFT is 5 hours,
which might sound long.

00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.020
But the Moller-Plesset
is a year,

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:39.180
and the coupled cluster
approach is 2,000 years.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.800
I don't think
anybody's tested that,

00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:43.700
but I wouldn't recommend it.

00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:48.010
But suddenly, you can see why
if you want to do anything

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.150
more than just two atoms,
maybe DFT would be a good way

00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:54.750
to go about it.

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:59.540
So this is a graph just showing,
again, that DFT scales better

00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.190
than all the other approaches.

00:43:04.450 --> 00:43:07.930
So again, the basic
tenet of DFT is

00:43:07.930 --> 00:43:09.850
we've taken this
really complicated,

00:43:09.850 --> 00:43:13.000
multi-electron wave
function, which we already

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.440
had trouble enough calculating
in the quantum chemistry

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:15.940
method.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.190
I mean, we already
found problems

00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:20.470
that if we tried
to simplify this

00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:25.240
by making this a function
of each individual electron,

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.080
we suddenly lost all
the electron correlation

00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.840
and exchange, which is
pretty crucial to getting

00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.150
these calculations right.

00:43:35.150 --> 00:43:37.550
And we know that the square
of this wave function

00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:39.830
is the electron density anyway.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.665
So let's just think
about the density.

00:43:45.850 --> 00:43:50.440
So does anybody know what a
functional is, any math people?

00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.370
MICHELE: Great.

00:43:52.370 --> 00:43:53.090
Great.

00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:58.700
So generally a function, you
input a number and output

00:43:58.700 --> 00:43:59.630
a number.

00:43:59.630 --> 00:44:03.330
A functional, you input a
function and output a number.

00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:05.810
So this is called "density
functional theory,"

00:44:05.810 --> 00:44:10.460
because we are writing a
functional of the function

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:12.030
density.

00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:14.580
Density is a function.

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:17.190
At every point in space,
there is a particular value

00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.690
of the density.

00:44:19.690 --> 00:44:23.330
And so we would like
to be able to solve

00:44:23.330 --> 00:44:28.310
this energy as a
function of the density

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:31.920
or I guess a functional
of the density.

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:34.950
So of course, we're going to
see all the familiar terms

00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:37.460
showing up-- the
kinetic energy, the ion

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.470
potential, the
ion-electron interaction,

00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:41.720
electron-electron interaction.

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:43.762
We're going to see all
the same terms showing up.

00:44:43.762 --> 00:44:46.602
And we'll just have to deal
with them slightly differently.

00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:52.490
So the way we actually
go about solving this

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:57.560
is we write some equation of
all of the different terms,

00:44:57.560 --> 00:45:01.160
as far as we know
what they look like.

00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:07.540
We write out the density in
terms of its wave functions,

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.250
and then do a
functional derivative

00:45:09.250 --> 00:45:11.630
of one of these wave functions.

00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:13.620
And so the functional
derivative works--

00:45:13.620 --> 00:45:16.940
it's basically just a
variational principle.

00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:19.340
Are you guys familiar with
the variational principle

00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:20.848
in quantum mechanics?

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:30.150
The lowest energy possible for
a system is the ground state.

00:45:30.150 --> 00:45:34.190
And so any time that you can
find any system that gives you

00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:37.880
a lower energy, you're getting
closer to the ground state.

00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:42.560
So I have my basic
Schrodinger equation.

00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:49.040
If I can change something
about this wave function

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.950
such that when I solve this
equation I get a lower energy,

00:45:51.950 --> 00:45:55.197
I probably have something that's
closer to the true ground state

00:45:55.197 --> 00:45:56.030
than I used to have.

00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:58.808
Because the smallest
possible value

00:45:58.808 --> 00:46:00.350
for this energy that
I can get out of

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.020
this equation is going
to be the ground state.

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.800
So that's actually used a
lot in quantum mechanics.

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:12.860
So maybe I don't know exactly
what this function looks like,

00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:15.320
but I can kind of guess what
this function looks like.

00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:21.890
And I can minimize this energy
with respect to what exactly

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:23.900
this wave function looks like.

00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.320
And that's exactly
what we're doing here.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:30.182
We're minimizing this
energy the best that we can,

00:46:30.182 --> 00:46:32.640
to try to get something that's
as close to the ground state

00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:34.620
as we can.

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.530
So that leads to the
Kohn-Sham equations.

00:46:38.530 --> 00:46:40.610
Again, this is pretty
much the same Hamiltonian

00:46:40.610 --> 00:46:44.330
you've been looking at all
class, all last week, too.

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:45.460
We have the kinetic term.

00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:49.120
We have the potential term, and
that acts on a wave function,

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.780
and gives us some eigenvalue
times the wave function.

00:46:52.780 --> 00:46:55.595
So in this case, our
potential is broken up

00:46:55.595 --> 00:46:56.970
into a couple of
different terms.

00:46:56.970 --> 00:47:00.770
So we've already made the
Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

00:47:00.770 --> 00:47:03.610
So we're ignoring the
ion-ion potential.

00:47:03.610 --> 00:47:04.870
We can add that in whenever.

00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:08.020
That doesn't change.

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.430
We have the ion interaction
with the electrons.

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:15.070
We have the electrons
interacting with themselves.

00:47:15.070 --> 00:47:17.620
And now we have this new term
that's called the "exchange

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.055
correlation potential."

00:47:21.730 --> 00:47:25.920
So this is the energy right
here that we were missing before

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:27.780
in the quantum
chemistry approach.

00:47:32.932 --> 00:47:34.390
But there's a
problem-- we actually

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:36.520
don't know what this
exchange correlation

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:39.050
function looks like.

00:47:39.050 --> 00:47:43.510
So people use a bunch of
different approximations.

00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:47.410
The two most commonly used are
the local density approximation

00:47:47.410 --> 00:47:50.830
and the general
gradient approximation.

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:54.460
And they're pretty
self-explanatory.

00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.710
The local density
approximation, you just

00:47:56.710 --> 00:48:02.980
approximate the local density
as being a flat in a local area.

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:04.630
And the general
gradient approximation,

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:06.800
you assume a first derivative.

00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:17.590
So if you have some potential
that looks like this,

00:48:17.590 --> 00:48:22.270
the local density approximation
might approximate it

00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:26.920
as looking something like that,
whereas the general gradient

00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:30.340
approximation would get
the slopes for each.

00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:35.710
So generally, the general
gradient approximation

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.557
ends up being a little
bit more accurate,

00:48:37.557 --> 00:48:39.640
but they both have their
strengths and weaknesses.

00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.640
And depending on what
problem you want to solve,

00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:44.230
you really need to pay
attention to what you

00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:46.910
should expect from either one.

00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:52.030
So how does this
process actually work?

00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:55.110
So this is a lot like the
solution to the Hartree

00:48:55.110 --> 00:48:55.890
equation.

00:48:55.890 --> 00:49:02.430
We start with our guess at the
position of the ions, which

00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:04.290
may or may not change.

00:49:04.290 --> 00:49:06.810
From there, we
also need to start

00:49:06.810 --> 00:49:10.080
with a couple initial parameters
that we didn't talk about

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.570
for the Hartree case.

00:49:11.570 --> 00:49:14.070
So in this case, we're going
to pick a cut-off for the plane

00:49:14.070 --> 00:49:14.620
wave basis.

00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.953
So that's something I'm going
to talk about in a minute.

00:49:16.953 --> 00:49:18.480
I haven't talked about that yet.

00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.100
Then we guess what our electrons
look like in the system.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:24.440
From that guess
of the electrons,

00:49:24.440 --> 00:49:28.730
we calculate the terms in the
Hamiltonian that we're missing.

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:29.900
We solve the Hamiltonian.

00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:32.080
We just diagonalize it.

00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:37.150
And that diagonalization
gives us a new density.

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:40.270
And then again, we ask,
is this density close

00:49:40.270 --> 00:49:42.860
enough to our input density
or is it pretty far away?

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.750
And if it's pretty far
away, we go back up,

00:49:46.750 --> 00:49:50.140
use that new calculated density,
again to calculate the terms

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:53.250
in the Hamiltonian
that we were missing,

00:49:53.250 --> 00:49:56.820
diagonalize the Hamiltonian
again, get a new density.

00:49:56.820 --> 00:50:01.020
And we just keep doing this
again and again until we've

00:50:01.020 --> 00:50:02.957
found something
that we say is close

00:50:02.957 --> 00:50:05.040
enough to the original
density that we've probably

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.360
found something that's
a good approximation.

00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:09.810
So you'll notice
that this is actually

00:50:09.810 --> 00:50:11.160
different from the Hartree.

00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:14.370
So this looks very similar to
the solution of the Hartree

00:50:14.370 --> 00:50:20.520
equation, but you'll notice that
instead of solving one electron

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:23.550
wave function at
a time, every time

00:50:23.550 --> 00:50:25.680
we have to do the
self-consistent cycle.

00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:28.800
All we have to do here is just
diagonalize this Hamiltonian.

00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:31.230
So this is why the
process speeds up so much.

00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.090
There are a bunch of
software that people

00:50:39.090 --> 00:50:42.030
use for DFT calculations.

00:50:42.030 --> 00:50:43.090
Some of them are free.

00:50:43.090 --> 00:50:45.030
Some of them are not.

00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:47.100
I think you guys
are using Siesta,

00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.230
which is not on this table.

00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:53.580
But all of these
different software

00:50:53.580 --> 00:50:56.610
have their strengths
and weaknesses.

00:50:56.610 --> 00:50:58.500
And depending on what
you want to calculate,

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.480
you should probably
think about which

00:51:00.480 --> 00:51:03.160
model is the best for you.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:09.870
But we're going to be looking
at a PWscf input file,

00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:12.300
just to give you a general
idea of what these input files

00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:15.673
look like. and I guess pretty
soon you'll find out anyway,

00:51:15.673 --> 00:51:17.340
since you'll have to
write some of them.

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:22.830
So I promised you I was going
to talk about basis functions.

00:51:22.830 --> 00:51:25.500
That was that one parameter
in the self-consistent cycle

00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:28.860
that you have to pick.

00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:35.340
So a basis function is
basically just whatever function

00:51:35.340 --> 00:51:39.240
you like, what function you want
to deal with mathematically,

00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:43.260
that you can write your
wave functions in terms of.

00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:47.370
So all we do is we take our wave
functions and we expand them.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:50.550
So we get some linear
combination of whatever basis

00:51:50.550 --> 00:51:51.600
we like.

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:55.710
So usually, people pick
Gaussians, or plane waves,

00:51:55.710 --> 00:51:57.690
or things that are
really easy to calculate,

00:51:57.690 --> 00:52:03.300
because you can write
any wave function

00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:05.760
in terms of a linear
combination of these,

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.910
as long as you have
a complete basis.

00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:17.310
So we pick these spaces such
that it's orthonormalized.

00:52:17.310 --> 00:52:22.950
What we can do from
that is when you

00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:25.663
multiply one of
these by another one,

00:52:25.663 --> 00:52:26.830
you'll get a delta function.

00:52:26.830 --> 00:52:30.750
So basically, if I
multiply through by--

00:52:30.750 --> 00:52:33.510
so I have to integrate
over all space

00:52:33.510 --> 00:52:36.490
because these functions
exist over all space.

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:37.950
So I integrate over all space.

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:42.690
I pick one of these
particular basic functions

00:52:42.690 --> 00:52:44.280
that I multiply by.

00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:49.810
And that picks out exactly
the j basis function here.

00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:51.720
So this whole term,
when I integrate out,

00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:54.870
because it's orthogonal, I
only get the j term here.

00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:57.270
Because it's
normalized, I get 1.

00:52:57.270 --> 00:53:01.470
So I'm just left with this
E and c j on this side.

00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:05.970
On this side, when I do that
same integration over all space

00:53:05.970 --> 00:53:11.212
and multiplication by
this j basis function,

00:53:11.212 --> 00:53:13.170
I get something more
complicated because I have

00:53:13.170 --> 00:53:17.130
this Hamiltonian in between.

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:20.130
So this Hamilton,
this H i j function,

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:26.920
is actually not quite
as simple as it looks.

00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:34.820
It's an integration over all
space of the Hamiltonian acting

00:53:34.820 --> 00:53:42.280
on the basis set i, and then
the inner product of that

00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:47.612
with basis set j, the
complex conjugate.

00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.310
But this is something
we can calculate.

00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:56.290
This actually ends up
being the Hamiltonian

00:53:56.290 --> 00:53:58.940
that we diagonalize in the end.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:02.260
So you can see that the choice
of these basis functions,

00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:05.110
to make it something that's
easy to calculate this term,

00:54:05.110 --> 00:54:08.650
is going to be really crucial
for getting the shortest

00:54:08.650 --> 00:54:10.450
possible computation time.

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:22.310
One that's commonly
used is plane waves.

00:54:22.310 --> 00:54:25.220
This is a plane wave.

00:54:25.220 --> 00:54:31.670
The exact form of the ones
we use, e to the i G j dot r.

00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:41.660
You guys know the e to
the i x is equal to cosine

00:54:41.660 --> 00:54:43.820
x plus i sine x.

00:54:51.867 --> 00:54:53.950
So you can see why these
are called "plane waves,"

00:54:53.950 --> 00:54:59.470
because in real space, they're
basically just some wave.

00:55:06.550 --> 00:55:09.010
So this r is the
real space vector.

00:55:09.010 --> 00:55:11.770
What we have to do
is pick what j's

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:13.700
we're going to use
in our simulation.

00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.830
So really, if we're going to
expand any function in terms

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:21.170
of this basis, we need
the spaces to be complete,

00:55:21.170 --> 00:55:25.010
which means basically
what it says.

00:55:25.010 --> 00:55:30.340
It's "complete," meaning you can
expand anything in terms of it.

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:33.610
But we don't really want
a complete basis set,

00:55:33.610 --> 00:55:35.250
because for this to
be complete, this G

00:55:35.250 --> 00:55:36.580
would have to go to infinity.

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:41.230
We'd have to go for every number
for G between 0 and infinity,

00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:45.280
and we don't have the
computational time to do that,

00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:48.580
because the size of our
Hamiltonian that we diagonalize

00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:51.910
depends on the number of these
functions that we put in.

00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:56.020
So what we hope to do
is pick a maximum G

00:55:56.020 --> 00:56:00.900
that's sufficient to capture
all of the physics that happens,

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:03.360
but not so big that our
computational time takes

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:04.210
forever.

00:56:04.210 --> 00:56:09.150
So as I increase G, I
get shorter and shorter

00:56:09.150 --> 00:56:10.590
wavelengths.

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:13.380
And at some point,
this wavelength

00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.970
is going to be so
short that it's

00:56:14.970 --> 00:56:19.350
going to represent a really
high kinetic energy system.

00:56:19.350 --> 00:56:21.270
And it's going to
be just un-physical.

00:56:21.270 --> 00:56:27.030
I mean, if I have an atom here,
an atom here, an atom here,

00:56:27.030 --> 00:56:29.040
probably the variation
in the electron density

00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.040
is not this great right
around that nucleus.

00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:36.630
And so at some point,
we can just cut off G,

00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:38.665
and say we have enough.

00:56:38.665 --> 00:56:40.290
We can probably
capture all the physics

00:56:40.290 --> 00:56:47.330
we need just going up
to the G that we have.

00:56:47.330 --> 00:56:50.740
So you can see actually how this
plane wave basis works really

00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:53.020
well for periodic crystals.

00:56:53.020 --> 00:56:57.680
I just drew nuclei here.

00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:02.780
So when you have an
infinite crystal,

00:57:02.780 --> 00:57:09.920
you have a nucleus here, a
nucleus here, a nucleus here.

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:11.930
And because they're
all the same,

00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:14.180
you don't expect that the
wave function or the density

00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:16.370
should be different
at this nucleus

00:57:16.370 --> 00:57:18.380
than it is at this nucleus.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:22.870
So this plane wave is actually
a great representation of that

00:57:22.870 --> 00:57:26.050
because the density is the
same here as it is here,

00:57:26.050 --> 00:57:27.130
as it'll be here.

00:57:27.130 --> 00:57:30.520
And so these plane
waves are actually

00:57:30.520 --> 00:57:34.440
ideal for calculating
periodic crystals.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.690
So how are we going
to attack molecules?

00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:45.700
What we're going to do is
put these molecules in a box.

00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:48.900
We're going to put them in a
box with some amount of vacuum

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:54.630
on either side, and then repeat
that box in all directions.

00:57:54.630 --> 00:58:01.010
In x, in y, in z, we're going
to infinitely repeat this box.

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:04.810
And so now instead of having
an atom here, an atom here,

00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:06.210
an atom here,
we're going to have

00:58:06.210 --> 00:58:11.240
a molecule here, and a molecule
here, and a molecule here.

00:58:11.240 --> 00:58:13.300
So you can see how
maybe with this,

00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:15.460
these plane waves might
represent that system

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.470
a little bit better.

00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:18.220
But there are some
things you have to take

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:19.510
into consideration with this.

00:58:22.630 --> 00:58:25.240
Since there's a molecule here
and some distance away there's

00:58:25.240 --> 00:58:27.620
another molecule, they might
interact with each other.

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:29.890
And if you want just the
properties of that molecule

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:32.650
by itself in vacuum, you
don't want them interacting

00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:34.590
with other molecules.

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.130
So you need to make
sure that you've

00:58:36.130 --> 00:58:38.770
included enough vacuum
between these molecules,

00:58:38.770 --> 00:58:42.370
between the molecule and
the edge of its unit cell,

00:58:42.370 --> 00:58:46.280
that the interaction
will be negligible

00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.920
or will be on the
order of the error

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:51.290
that you have from everything
else in your calculation.

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.080
So once we've done
this, we can then

00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:55.400
start our self-consistent loop.

00:58:55.400 --> 00:58:57.280
So what happens?

00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:02.380
We put in where the ions are.

00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:04.040
We calculate our potential.

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:08.637
We've guessed at some
original electron density.

00:59:08.637 --> 00:59:10.720
We've calculated all the
terms in the Hamiltonian.

00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:12.610
We've diagonalized
that Hamiltonian.

00:59:12.610 --> 00:59:16.090
That diagonalization
gives us our energy.

00:59:16.090 --> 00:59:20.590
And then the program said, well,
that new density wasn't really

00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.650
close to the old density.

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:22.608
So let's do that again.

00:59:22.608 --> 00:59:25.010
And it does that again,
and calculates energy.

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:29.090
And you can see how the
energy always goes down.

00:59:29.090 --> 00:59:30.470
So this is a negative number.

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:31.798
The energy always goes down.

00:59:31.798 --> 00:59:33.340
So that's the
variational principle--

00:59:33.340 --> 00:59:35.500
as you approach the
correct ground state,

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.282
you get lower in energy.

00:59:37.282 --> 00:59:38.740
And you can see
that the difference

00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:41.550
between these successively
gets smaller and smaller.

00:59:41.550 --> 00:59:44.050
And that's what you really want
to have happen, because that

00:59:44.050 --> 00:59:46.180
means that your
energy is converging,

00:59:46.180 --> 00:59:49.420
and you'll end up with a
pretty good approximation

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.980
of the ground state energy.

00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:54.800
You've also ended up
with the charge density,

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.320
because that's what you've been
calculating this whole time

00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:59.730
to calculate the energy.

00:59:59.730 --> 01:00:01.890
So just with those
two properties,

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:04.050
and being kind of
clever, you can actually

01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:08.070
calculate a huge range of
important molecular and solid

01:00:08.070 --> 01:00:08.590
properties.

01:00:08.590 --> 01:00:11.400
So you calculate at least
you can guess at a structure.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:14.130
You can calculate bulk
modulus, shear modulus,

01:00:14.130 --> 01:00:15.750
elastic constants.

01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:19.710
You can calculate vibrational
properties and sound velocity.

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:23.550
Binding energy is
actually just probably

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:27.480
going to be this energy
that you've calculated.

01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.430
You can kind of guess
at reaction pathways.

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:32.430
Those are a little bit harder
to do with this approach.

01:00:32.430 --> 01:00:34.770
You can calculate
forces, pressure, stress.

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:36.990
You can calculate all
of these properties just

01:00:36.990 --> 01:00:41.280
with this simple calculation
that we can now do.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.350
But how do we know that these
calculations are meaningful?

01:00:44.350 --> 01:00:47.130
How do we know that we've
actually said anything useful?

01:00:47.130 --> 01:00:50.430
Dirac was complaining
that he found

01:00:50.430 --> 01:00:52.680
that his calculations never
really matched experiment,

01:00:52.680 --> 01:00:54.690
but don't lose heart.

01:00:54.690 --> 01:00:58.350
But when should you lose heart?

01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:01.830
Or when should you
maybe check to make sure

01:01:01.830 --> 01:01:05.070
that what you're doing is
as accurate as you can get?

01:01:05.070 --> 01:01:07.970
We need to talk
about convergence.

01:01:07.970 --> 01:01:10.490
So there are a couple
of different properties

01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:15.530
that you need to worry about.

01:01:15.530 --> 01:01:17.660
We talked about is
the basis big enough.

01:01:17.660 --> 01:01:20.660
So that's, did I
pick a high enough G

01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:26.600
that I got enough wiggliness
of my wave functions, my input

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:29.480
basis wave functions,
that I've captured

01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.930
all the relevant physics?

01:01:30.930 --> 01:01:33.710
And so this is the trade-off.

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:37.460
It takes more time if you
have a larger basis set,

01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:40.520
but you also lose some
accuracy by decreasing

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.020
the size of your basis set.

01:01:42.020 --> 01:01:46.910
And at some point,
when you've taken out

01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:48.942
too many basic
functions, you suddenly

01:01:48.942 --> 01:01:50.900
get something that's not
going to be meaningful

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.540
at all because you just don't
have the right structure

01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:54.560
of the potential.

01:01:57.410 --> 01:01:59.750
We talked about is
the box big enough.

01:01:59.750 --> 01:02:02.000
Did you include enough
vacuum so that you

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.110
don't get interactions between
molecules in neighboring unit

01:02:06.110 --> 01:02:06.710
cells?

01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:09.620
Because if you want the
properties of the molecule

01:02:09.620 --> 01:02:11.540
by itself in vacuum,
you don't want

01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:14.270
the interaction of those two
molecules to play a part.

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:18.480
But here we get, actually, a
trade-off with the basis set.

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:20.690
So the bigger you make
your box, the bigger

01:02:20.690 --> 01:02:22.790
you need your basis set to be.

01:02:22.790 --> 01:02:32.210
So you can see if this is
the size of my box here,

01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:33.290
and this is my cut-off--

01:02:33.290 --> 01:02:34.820
G has a wavelength of this--

01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:37.910
if I suddenly make
my box much bigger,

01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:39.740
this wavelength
is going to expand

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:45.300
and it's going to be a
much bigger wavelength.

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.570
And so maybe now
this is actually

01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:49.640
an important wavelength
to my system.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.040
And maybe even a
smaller wavelength

01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.440
is an important
wavelength to my system.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.360
Does that make sense?

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.880
OK, so making your
box bigger means

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.710
that you need a bigger
basis set, which

01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:07.900
means more computational
time, but on the other hand,

01:03:07.900 --> 01:03:10.200
you don't want to include
the effects of intermolecular

01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:11.520
interaction.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:16.350
Finally, you can ask if you
exited the self-consistent loop

01:03:16.350 --> 01:03:18.360
at the right time.

01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:21.932
So I keep saying, well,
we compare the old density

01:03:21.932 --> 01:03:23.890
to the new density and
if they're close enough,

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:25.110
then we assume it's right.

01:03:25.110 --> 01:03:28.170
But what's that definition
of "close enough?"

01:03:28.170 --> 01:03:31.200
And how do you know that that
definition of "close enough"

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.907
is close enough?

01:03:32.907 --> 01:03:34.740
So that's another
property that you're going

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.823
to have to converge along.

01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:42.980
So let's just take a look
at an example input file,

01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:45.410
and see how some of these
properties that you need

01:03:45.410 --> 01:03:47.900
to converge along, and the
other properties you might care

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.750
about, show up in this system.

01:03:51.750 --> 01:03:57.930
So we might care about
putting in the right atoms,

01:03:57.930 --> 01:03:59.670
talk about how the
atoms are related

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:03.000
to each other spatially,
and then these three

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:08.030
parameters that we talked about
that we need to converge along.

01:04:08.030 --> 01:04:13.430
So this is just a
sample of water.

01:04:13.430 --> 01:04:16.880
And so here, this is
the size of the cell.

01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.710
This is the number of atoms,
number of types of atoms.

01:04:20.710 --> 01:04:25.790
This is ecut, this
is the energy cutoff,

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:29.636
which refers to
the size of your G,

01:04:29.636 --> 01:04:33.630
and then your atoms and
the atomic positions.

01:04:33.630 --> 01:04:36.790
And these are just
the pseudo potentials.

01:04:36.790 --> 01:04:39.690
So we haven't talked at all
about pseudo potentials,

01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:44.190
but just so you know,
we talked about the fact

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:50.240
that when we think
about atoms we only care

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:52.820
about the valence electrons.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.070
So all those core
electrons still exist,

01:04:55.070 --> 01:04:56.640
but we don't want
to calculate them.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.600
So we use pseudo potentials
to sort of capture

01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:01.370
those inner electrons
a little bit,

01:05:01.370 --> 01:05:04.713
and tell us how those
inner electrons are

01:05:04.713 --> 01:05:07.130
going to affect the valence
electrons and everything else.

01:05:07.130 --> 01:05:13.100
Because when we
have an atom that

01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:16.110
has some core of electrons--

01:05:16.110 --> 01:05:20.510
so let's say this
has 27 protons in it.

01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:22.220
An electron out
here is not going

01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:25.970
to feel that 27 proton charge.

01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:28.940
It's going to feel that
27 protons shielded

01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:31.950
by some number of
core electrons.

01:05:31.950 --> 01:05:38.300
And so to get the Coulomb
interaction right there,

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:41.150
we need to have some
kind of modified version

01:05:41.150 --> 01:05:45.170
of what exactly our atoms'
potential looks like.

01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:49.050
So that's what the pseudo
potentials are about.

01:05:49.050 --> 01:05:53.010
So that's it.

01:05:53.010 --> 01:05:57.420
We've covered the basis of
quantum chemistry and density

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:59.500
functional theory today.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.040
Are there any questions?

01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.890
All right, thank you.

EARLL MURMAN: Well,
good morning, Claudio.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.470
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Good morning, Earll.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.790
Thank you, again, for coming.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.140
It's always a pleasure to
show you the factory to you.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.740
So before the main
purpose of today,

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.780
I'll show you the value stream,
the factory, the product flow.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.810
But before that, I'm
going to give you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.733
a little preview of who we are.

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:08.900
EARLL MURMAN: Oh, wonderful.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.025
Yeah.

00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:10.230
Well, everybody
knows New Balance,

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.855
but tell us about
your journey to lean.

00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.300
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Specifically
about the Lawrence factory.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.500
The factory, it specifically
is divided into--

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.008
standing here, you've got to
your left side the portion

00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:22.550
that we call the
[? cutting ?] stage.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.540
This is the made in America
shoes that we cut from scratch

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.590
and we cut here.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.730
And to your right--

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:29.750
it's my right side--

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.930
is what we call the
source upper world.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.710
We get the sole and
the upper from Asia,

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.260
and we just put it together.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.260
EARLL MURMAN: Now, are
you the only shoe company

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:42.080
that actually manufactures
shoes in the US?

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.280
CLAUDIO GELMAN: I
understand yes, it is.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.080
EARLL MURMAN: That's
what's behind me here.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.110
CLAUDIO GELMAN: And that's our
competitive advantage is great.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.307
You know, turn around
shoes in two or three days.

00:01:51.307 --> 00:01:52.640
EARLL MURMAN: Two or three days?

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.080
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yeah,
we're going to get it

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.940
in the customer's hand.

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.310
EARLL MURMAN: We'll see
how you do that when

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.290
we go through the value stream.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.300
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Absolutely, I'll show that.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.610
So some statistics, we
pack 5,200 pair a day

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.500
and ship 5,200 pair a day.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.840
We are 220 associates.

00:02:12.013 --> 00:02:14.680
I'm going to show you when we go
through operation and the value

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.700
stream, which is a group
operation put strategically

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.503
in a cell or U-shape
to make a product.

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:24.920
There's some history behind
it, and it's very interesting.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.820
What you see here is a
product of three and a half,

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.400
four years of lean
transformation.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.990
Three and a half
years ago, we decided

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:33.790
to work with a
[INAUDIBLE] production

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.190
company to learn about that,
their production system,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.100
which lean is
another name for it.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:43.900
Four years ago,
it used to take us

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.360
eight days to make
a pair of shoes.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.960
Eight days.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.870
EARLL MURMAN: From
start to finish?

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.730
CLAUDIO GELMAN: From
start to finish.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.920
EARLL MURMAN: You mean you
weren't working on that shoe

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.390
the whole time but
start to finish--

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:53.110
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Well,
that's a good question

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.420
because it's what we call
the value added work,

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.450
which was only 23 minutes.

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.820
So the shoe was floating in
this factory for eight days,

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:03.760
with only associates
touching the shoe,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.540
adding value to the
shoe for 23 minutes.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.180
With lean transformation,
after three and a half years,

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.280
we went from eight
days to right now,

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.880
it would take us between two
and three hours in value stream

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.570
to produce a pair of shoes.

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.597
So that's in 98% reduction.

00:03:19.597 --> 00:03:22.180
EARLL MURMAN: It's still about
23 minutes of value added time?

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.590
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.520
EARLL MURMAN: So
there's actually still

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.380
some room potentially
for improvement.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.880
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Once you start lean,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.200
it becomes part of your DNA.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.430
You never stop.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:33.670
Well, you see supervisors
and flow coordinators,

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.370
which are our team leaders,
always with a watch,

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.000
looking at the cycle
time to see if there's

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.815
opportunity to improve.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:49.190
So there are other
statistics we reduced.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.800
We used to be in two floors.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.850
Right now, we're in one.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.620
We emptied a quarter.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.510
I think it's close to
2,500 square feet of floor.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.343
The beginning of
a value stream--

00:04:01.343 --> 00:04:03.260
in those days, it was
not called value stream.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.150
It was like straight lines--

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.575
used to be in the first
floor, the beginning.

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:09.950
And being on the second floor
was too much communication.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.680
EARLL MURMAN: So now you can
see the whole value stream.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.758
CLAUDIO GELMAN: And
I'll show you later,

00:04:14.758 --> 00:04:16.300
from a management
point of view, they

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.540
built it to have a value stream
where the beginning and the end

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.089
meet.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.090
It's extremely powerful.

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:26.520
So square footage, I think,
is close to 30% reduction.

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.770
It's a work in process.

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.290
Like I said, 98%,
so it's incredible.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.720
So how did we do that?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.130
Part of lean, there are two
basic concepts, takt time,

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.100
which is flow based on our
capacity of the value stream

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.600
and availability.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.290
It's a takt time of 25,
22 and 1/2 seconds, which

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.210
means that it's a frequency.

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.052
Takt time is a
frequency of delivery,

00:04:54.052 --> 00:04:55.510
so at the end of
the line, you will

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:57.420
see a shoe leaving every 22.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.170
EARLL MURMAN: Or a
pair of shoes every 45.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.295
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely.

00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:03.210
So that's the concept of
the takt time and flow,

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:06.400
and the other
concept is of waste.

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.180
Actually, we have a course we
call waste detectives, where

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.490
we put our associates
through and identify,

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:14.720
what is a way in
the lean world--

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.380
EARLL MURMAN: Is every
associate a waste detective?

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.172
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yes,
that's where they are.

00:05:19.172 --> 00:05:22.190
Everyone here becomes
a waste detective.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.620
I have a poster,
very interesting,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.490
that I like to use for tours and
also for educational purposes,

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.090
where in the lean world, they
are like the deadly wastes.

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.380
And they are-- I'll go through
with you-- overproduction,

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.860
when we produce ahead, waiting,
and this is very interesting.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.840
There are some
interesting pictures,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.560
with associates participating
in them, of the examples.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.630
Transportation, overprocessing.

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:48.850
EARLL MURMAN: So just on
the waiting, for example,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.400
eight days with 23
minutes of value

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.363
added, there was
a lot of waiting.

00:05:53.363 --> 00:05:55.280
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yes, and
it used to be normal.

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.170
Now, it's--

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.628
EARLL MURMAN: On transportation,
you had two floors before.

00:05:58.628 --> 00:05:59.753
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely.

00:05:59.753 --> 00:06:00.640
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.140
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Overprocessing, this

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:05.140
is a interesting way that people
sometimes have to understand.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:08.740
In this particular
case, this shoe,

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:10.870
it needs a row of
stitching at the bottom.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.302
Now, they put two.

00:06:12.302 --> 00:06:14.260
People may think, well,
two is better than one.

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.550
No, it's not.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.490
The shoe needs one, but
sometimes, we tend to add two.

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.860
Like maybe three coats of
paint when two was enough.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:21.550
EARLL MURMAN: Oh,
very interesting.

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:22.220
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So
we look into that.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.445
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:06:23.445 --> 00:06:24.820
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Excess inventory.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:25.360
EARLL MURMAN: Yep.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.277
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Waste.

00:06:26.277 --> 00:06:27.703
I mean, interesting,
assets seems

00:06:27.703 --> 00:06:28.870
to be in the balance sheets.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:29.320
EARLL MURMAN: And
we'll see this--

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.940
CLAUDIO GELMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.910
EARLL MURMAN: We'll
see this as soon as we

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.215
start the value stream walk.

00:06:32.215 --> 00:06:33.340
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.920
Actually, this is the first
part of the cutting department.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.400
Unnecessary motion, safety
has a lot to do with here.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.150
Here, you have an
associate placing a shoe

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.360
and overstretching, very
different from getting closer

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.280
to an associate.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.660
And defects.

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:50.790
And we added an eight, which
is unused associate creativity.

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.790
EARLL MURMAN: Wonderful.

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:53.680
CLAUDIO GELMAN: It's wonderful.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.060
What we've all been trained here
is that, as we walk the floor,

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.320
we do analysis.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.828
We are trying to
identify this waste.

00:07:02.828 --> 00:07:04.120
We see somebody overstretching.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.200
It's motion.

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.730
We see somebody waiting.

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:10.660
So whenever we
see this waste, we

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.630
put together a continuous
improvement activity.

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:15.260
They call this an activity.

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.820
So the whole goal is
reduce waste, improve flow.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:20.323
Reduce waste, improve flow.

00:07:20.323 --> 00:07:22.240
EARLL MURMAN: I want to
see your value stream.

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:22.700
Can we get started?

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.230
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Let's start it, then.

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.644
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:07:23.644 --> 00:07:24.058
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely.

00:07:24.058 --> 00:07:25.300
EARLL MURMAN: Wonderful.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.992
CLAUDIO GELMAN: This is the
beginning of the value stream.

00:07:28.992 --> 00:07:31.450
EARLL MURMAN: So this is the
front end of your value stream

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:31.910
here?

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.490
CLAUDIO GELMAN: This is the
front end of our value stream.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:35.020
EARLL MURMAN: And you don't
call this a department.

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.100
You call it a value stream.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:36.820
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
The value stream.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.190
The definition is the
value stream is a series

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:44.200
of operations put in
sequence-- we call it a cell--

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.703
to make a particular product.

00:07:46.703 --> 00:07:48.120
It doesn't have
to be one product.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.990
It can two products,
three products,

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.300
but there is some
similar operations.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:53.550
And then you can connect them.

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:54.258
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:07:54.258 --> 00:07:56.710
Now in a little
bit bigger sense,

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.656
your value stream goes all
the way back to your suppliers

00:07:59.656 --> 00:08:03.167
and eventually out to
your stores and so on,

00:08:03.167 --> 00:08:05.000
but we're looking just
at the value stream--

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:05.800
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.580
EARLL MURMAN:
--starting with what's

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.405
coming from the suppliers.

00:08:07.405 --> 00:08:08.988
And maybe at the
end, we'll see what's

00:08:08.988 --> 00:08:10.150
going out to your stores.

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:10.630
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Correct.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.580
And as a concept of
value stream issues

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:14.770
within a cell in manufacturing,
the [? concept ?]

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.200
is also true for the
whole corporation,

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.170
whether we are, let's say,
a purchasing department.

00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:24.120
It would be a department part
of the whole corporation's value

00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.420
stream, so you are correct.

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.153
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:08:27.153 --> 00:08:29.320
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So what you
see here is the cutting.

00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.220
That's the first operation,
and basically, materials

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.350
are coming from our suppliers.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.090
They come in in rolls.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.400
They go to the
consolidation center

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.590
and then pull based on the
demand and the production

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:44.090
schedule.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.507
EARLL MURMAN: So
this value stream

00:08:45.507 --> 00:08:46.610
pulls based on its demand.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:48.160
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Exactly, exactly.

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:52.120
And the materials
are layered, and we

00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.548
build what we call a web.

00:08:53.548 --> 00:08:54.424
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:08:54.424 --> 00:08:55.658
I can see it's stapled.

00:08:55.658 --> 00:08:56.700
It's stapled right there.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.090
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Exactly.

00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:00.643
How much is a given to
the cutter its based--

00:09:00.643 --> 00:09:02.060
so we have a
computer system that,

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:05.080
based on the schedule,
the number of pairs,

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.620
the size, and the width, puts
out how many pairs we need

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:15.100
and then how much square
footage to give to the cutter.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.165
EARLL MURMAN: How frequently
you make that calculation?

00:09:18.165 --> 00:09:19.790
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Well,
it's per quarter.

00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.630
Like, daily.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:21.050
EARLL MURMAN: Daily?

00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:21.967
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Daily.

00:09:21.967 --> 00:09:24.755
Daily, and right now with the
different materials, almost

00:09:24.755 --> 00:09:27.393
any calculation, we deliver
45 hours worth of material.

00:09:27.393 --> 00:09:29.560
EARLL MURMAN: So that's
kind of like adjusting time.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.930
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.660
So the cutter will
pick up what's

00:09:35.660 --> 00:09:40.610
called a die, which has
the shape of the part,

00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:45.710
with the hydraulic machine and
place the die on the material.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.529
The placement of the
die is called nesting.

00:09:47.529 --> 00:09:48.446
EARLL MURMAN: Nesting.

00:09:48.446 --> 00:09:49.672
OK.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.380
You're trying to
minimize waste, I guess.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.260
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Exactly,
it's like a puzzle.

00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:56.450
Cutters may take from
three months to six months

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.790
to get good at it, not only to
understand where the die goes,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:06.940
but also make it with speed
because talk about speed.

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.800
Let me talk a bit of
a key concept, which

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.270
is the concept of takt time.

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:18.080
In the lean world, the goal is
to flow and to reduce waste,

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.210
flow and to reduce waste.

00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:22.970
Based on the demand
in this value stream,

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:26.150
which is 50 cases a day,
a case being 12 pairs,

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.500
and available time per day--

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:28.520
EARLL MURMAN: That's
600 pairs a day

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.730
that this value stream puts out?

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.550
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
[INAUDIBLE] specifically.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.240
And seven and a half
hours in a shift.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.220
The frequency of output is
22 and 1/2 seconds per shoe.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:42.332
That frequency is
called takt time.

00:10:42.332 --> 00:10:43.040
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.373
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Takt time.

00:10:45.373 --> 00:10:47.540
Now, although I just mentioned
that the frequency is

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:52.460
22 and 1/2 seconds per
shoe, at this stage,

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:55.910
because of the characteristics
of the operation,

00:10:55.910 --> 00:10:59.370
we are not flowing
one shoe at a time.

00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:01.800
We are still in a batch world.

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.210
EARLL MURMAN: OK,
but a small batch?

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:05.830
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Small batches.

00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:10.160
In the past, as I said before,
when our lead time was eight

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.540
days, in an equivalent
value stream,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.840
we will have close to
400 cases of [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.560
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.160
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Now, with
the lead time of three hours,

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.210
our work in process
is 20, 25 cases.

00:11:25.210 --> 00:11:26.875
That's a reduction of 98%.

00:11:26.875 --> 00:11:29.250
EARLL MURMAN: So I see a little
green thing on the floor,

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:32.660
and the visual control says
cutting whip, seven cases

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:33.160
maximum.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:34.308
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely.

00:11:34.308 --> 00:11:36.350
EARLL MURMAN: So that's
all the space you've got.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:42.090
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So the cutters
will cut the individual parts

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.100
based on the material,
and they will be

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:46.870
placing the parts on the bins.

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:47.650
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:49.442
CLAUDIO GELMAN: When
they finish the hour--

00:11:49.442 --> 00:11:53.920
so here, the unit of flow--

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:55.570
you can call it an hour--

00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:59.602
could be between six and seven
cases, depending on the style.

00:11:59.602 --> 00:12:00.310
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:03.520
So while we're here, I see
a broom hanging up there,

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.620
so I want to just
ask you about 5S.

00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.650
CLAUDIO GELMAN: 5S,
actually, it's very typical.

00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:14.680
5S is a system or
an organization.

00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.200
5S is for Sort, Sitting
Order, Shine, Standardize,

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.090
and Sustain.

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:22.570
And it's much more
than just cleaning.

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.530
Once you understand the 5S,
there are economics in place,

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:31.480
and there is a very
key location of parts.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.880
This is the first system
implemented five years ago.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.422
EARLL MURMAN: I was
going to ask you.

00:12:35.422 --> 00:12:37.180
It's hard for me almost
to imagine a place

00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.690
where it wouldn't
naturally be 5S,

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.830
but you had to start with 5S.

00:12:40.830 --> 00:12:44.790
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Exactly, because
one of, I think, the mistakes

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:46.830
is thinking that 5S
is just cleaning.

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:48.292
So everybody
understands cleaning,

00:12:48.292 --> 00:12:49.500
and there's so much to clean.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.408
And when you're
starting a new process,

00:12:51.408 --> 00:12:53.200
you can get so many
gains by just cleaning.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.630
It looks good, but
there's much more to it.

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:58.650
But the broom in that place
with the label that says broom,

00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:59.310
that's been--

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:01.260
EARLL MURMAN: It becomes part
of your organizing your self.

00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:03.218
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely,
and it goes deeper.

00:13:03.218 --> 00:13:08.220
I think that 5S is actually
a reflection of leadership.

00:13:08.220 --> 00:13:13.250
If you cannot get an
organized workplace and clean,

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:17.370
your chances of flowing product
and meeting that takt time are

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:20.020
very slim, so it has to
do with the discipline.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.822
It's much deeper than
that, than just cleaning.

00:13:22.822 --> 00:13:23.530
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.180
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So this
is a cutting department.

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:36.610
About seven cases
now, and we're going

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.588
to walk to the next department
is called the prefit department

00:13:39.588 --> 00:13:40.630
part of the value stream.

00:13:40.630 --> 00:13:42.010
EARLL MURMAN: It looks like
the second part of the value

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:42.130
stream.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.200
CLAUDIO GELMAN: It's the second
thing in the value stream.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:44.800
EARLL MURMAN: You
got the cutting.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.092
Now we're going to do stitches.

00:13:46.092 --> 00:13:47.130
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Exactly.

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.320
The prefit is a
shoe-making technique.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.780
Many years ago when we
didn't have computers,

00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:55.290
the way a shoe was stitched
is it used to be fitted,

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:58.320
two parts coming together,
and a very skillful stitcher

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.730
would put it together.

00:13:59.730 --> 00:14:04.620
Before you're able to prefit
and stitch it, we fit it.

00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:07.525
It needs to be prefitted,
which is you do marking.

00:14:07.525 --> 00:14:08.560
You do embroidery.

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.050
You do other things before
you put the shoe together.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.240
That's where the name
comes from, prefit.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.960
So we do embroidery
with the logo.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.012
EARLL MURMAN: That's
where the NB comes on.

00:14:19.012 --> 00:14:22.140
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Our
main USA logo is there.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:26.700
And then you will see a series
of miscellaneous operations

00:14:26.700 --> 00:14:29.130
that are required to
make a shoe, for example,

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:31.530
the reinforcement of the tip.

00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:32.740
I talked about embroidery.

00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:34.140
Some styles take embroidery.

00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.370
Others do not.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:40.050
Here, we have a machine called
[INAUDIBLE],, a radio frequency

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:40.560
machine.

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:43.150
It's not being operated
right now, but as an example,

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:45.795
this is the part that will
make these [? decals. ?]

00:14:45.795 --> 00:14:50.680
It's a nice feature because
it's nice what it's going to do.

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.090
Again, some cells have it.

00:14:52.090 --> 00:14:53.560
Some cells do not.

00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:56.650
And if he go through
the team, you'll

00:14:56.650 --> 00:14:59.350
see associates making other
miscellaneous operations

00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.760
to the parts of the shoe.

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.650
EARLL MURMAN: You have the flow
of material start over there,

00:15:04.650 --> 00:15:05.230
goes to the--

00:15:05.230 --> 00:15:07.890
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So we
go cutting, prefit.

00:15:07.890 --> 00:15:09.750
Well, let's go to the
computer stitching,

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:15.320
and we'll see some stitching and
then eventually the assembly,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.675
where they put the sole on.

00:15:16.675 --> 00:15:18.800
EARLL MURMAN: So if things
are getting a little out

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.670
of sequence, timing-wise,
could someone from here

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.155
go over and help
the prefit people?

00:15:25.155 --> 00:15:26.780
CLAUDIO GELMAN: It's
a very good point.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.600
When we changed from the
batch and queue world

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.690
to the lean world, we changed
the management system.

00:15:32.690 --> 00:15:36.510
In the past, you have
associates and supervisors,

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:37.910
nobody in the middle.

00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:42.820
In order to support that takt
time of 22 and 1/2 seconds

00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.945
and maintain that flow,
now we changed the system

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.320
where we have the
supervisors, we

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:49.780
have the team leaders,
and then the associates.

00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:53.650
So team leaders fill in if there
is a disruption of any kind,

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:58.150
a bathroom break to a phone
call to a quality issue.

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.420
They will jump in to
maintain the flow.

00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:01.130
EARLL MURMAN: The
team leader will?

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:01.420
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.545
EARLL MURMAN: So the team
leader can do everything?

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:05.350
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely, yes.

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:10.510
So still, in this team and
the prefit, we have batches.

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.930
The parts are prefitted.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:16.160
We put a reinforcement
to the toe

00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.410
and make a little [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:19.017
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:16:19.017 --> 00:16:20.600
CLAUDIO GELMAN: These
associates, they

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.970
are making little
holes on the part.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:26.050
They put them back on those
bins that we talked before

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:30.340
and brought [INAUDIBLE] batch
to this department that's

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:31.830
called computer stitching.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:32.600
EARLL MURMAN:
Computer stitching.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.892
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So what I'm
going to show you right now

00:16:34.892 --> 00:16:42.920
are stitching machines, but they
have a computer and cameras.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:46.280
And the way it works, you'll
see an associate picking

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:48.105
these kinds of parts,
put them on what's

00:16:48.105 --> 00:16:52.720
called a pallet, these little
holes that you put on pins.

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.050
And they probably will
be fed into this machine,

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.960
and you have lights taking
pictures and a computer.

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.030
And it's taking a picture
three frames per second,

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.599
so the cameras tell the
computer, this is the edge.

00:17:07.599 --> 00:17:10.300
And the computer tells
the sewing machine

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.986
where to put the stitch.

00:17:11.986 --> 00:17:12.720
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:13.452
OK.

00:17:13.452 --> 00:17:15.660
CLAUDIO GELMAN: At this
computer stitching department

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:19.069
is where we transition
from the batch to the flow,

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:20.819
and that's what I'm
going to show you now.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.728
EARLL MURMAN: OK, great.

00:17:22.728 --> 00:17:24.270
CLAUDIO GELMAN: This
associate here--

00:17:24.270 --> 00:17:25.687
I forgot to mention
when we talked

00:17:25.687 --> 00:17:28.604
about the different management
system, remember takt time

00:17:28.604 --> 00:17:30.030
and flow.

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:31.860
Supervisor and team
leader to help,

00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:36.220
but also, we want associates
to be on the line producing

00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.010
the shoes at that takt time.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:40.764
So another level is
called the point of use.

00:17:40.764 --> 00:17:42.253
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:17:42.253 --> 00:17:43.920
CLAUDIO GELMAN: The
goal of point of use

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.100
is to bring the parts to--

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:47.940
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.190
CLAUDIO GELMAN: --the
operators, actually adding value

00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:50.870
to the shoe.

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:52.620
EARLL MURMAN: So this lady's
a point of use associate?

00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.520
CLAUDIO GELMAN: That's correct,
a point of use associate.

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:54.690
EARLL MURMAN: She
looks pretty busy, too.

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:55.920
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Very busy.

00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:59.370
They have to distribute a
case every nine minutes,

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.340
and they have the flow from
this computer stitching

00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.990
to the next department
and come back and flow.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:08.310
Everything is about flow.

00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:09.300
EARLL MURMAN: So
you want to keep

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.400
this person-- you want to
have everything she needs

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.525
to do what she needs to do.

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:15.570
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Exactly, exactly.

00:18:15.570 --> 00:18:18.270
In the past world, this person
would leave the machine,

00:18:18.270 --> 00:18:21.410
would go and pick up
the parts, come back.

00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:24.900
A lot of variability in the
system, and reduction of waste

00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.122
is to reduce variability
at the same time.

00:18:27.122 --> 00:18:29.580
EARLL MURMAN: They must have
to work very closely together.

00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.230
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yes, absolutely.

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:34.360
So here, you have the
computer stitching machine.

00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:39.880
These are the parts that
came from the cutting,

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:44.807
and the associate puts
the parts on this pallet.

00:18:44.807 --> 00:18:45.890
It's fed into the machine.

00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:46.070
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:47.570
Goes back in the machine.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.138
CLAUDIO GELMAN: You got the
cameras taking pictures.

00:18:50.138 --> 00:18:51.680
EARLL MURMAN: And
now it's stitching.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.555
CLAUDIO GELMAN: And then
the sewing machine's

00:18:53.555 --> 00:18:55.704
stitching where the computers
tell them to stitch.

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:01.990
The pallet comes up.

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:08.230
Here, we got the part.

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:08.938
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.450
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Now,
why only three parts?

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:19.880
It's because under the takt time
of 22 and 1/2 seconds, that's

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.490
all that fits in this machine.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:27.620
So we take all the time that
is required to stitch a shoe.

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:29.228
We divide it by 22
and 1/2 seconds,

00:19:29.228 --> 00:19:30.770
and that tells us
how many associates

00:19:30.770 --> 00:19:32.780
we need to put to flow.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:35.750
EARLL MURMAN: Now, when you
switched to the takt time

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:38.300
approach, did you have to
redesign some of these machines

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:38.930
to--

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:40.368
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Completely.

00:19:40.368 --> 00:19:40.910
In the past--

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.950
EARLL MURMAN: The old machines
couldn't fit the takt time?

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:43.460
CLAUDIO GELMAN: I'm sorry.

00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.360
The machines are OK.

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:46.318
We have to change the
thinking of the designing

00:19:46.318 --> 00:19:47.090
of the pallets.

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:49.670
In the past in the
batch and queue world,

00:19:49.670 --> 00:19:52.850
we were very proud when we could
put as many layers as possible

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:53.830
to save machinery.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:54.703
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:19:54.703 --> 00:19:56.870
CLAUDIO GELMAN: The goal
was the machine efficiency.

00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:57.350
EARLL MURMAN: Great.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.475
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Because
you get rewarded in a batch

00:19:59.475 --> 00:20:01.250
world for machine efficiency.

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.750
Right now, the goal
is into efficiency

00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:05.282
and associate [? tool ?] safety.

00:20:05.282 --> 00:20:05.990
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.580
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So
what we did is now

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.810
we don't takt as many
layers as we can.

00:20:09.810 --> 00:20:12.442
We only put enough
layers to maintain flow.

00:20:12.442 --> 00:20:14.150
The machines are the
same, but the design

00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:17.030
of the pallet and the number
of parts has changed radically.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.470
EARLL MURMAN: Very good.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:22.100
And did the associates
participate in that redesign?

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:23.392
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Oh, absolutely.

00:20:23.392 --> 00:20:24.860
I mean, that's a great question.

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.420
When we talk about
the team leaders,

00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:29.510
that's one of the
major, major changes.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.060
You know, we're reading the
books about our associates

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.180
are [INAUDIBLE] assets.

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:39.063
And I think we're
talking about--

00:20:39.063 --> 00:20:40.730
you know, we're doing
great things here,

00:20:40.730 --> 00:20:44.600
where associates
have a great part

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.930
in the problem-solving activity
and the design, supervisors

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.030
and team leaders
consulting all the time.

00:20:53.030 --> 00:20:54.870
That's what makes a
big, big difference.

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.480
But before when we
talk about batch,

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:58.250
now you see single
[INAUDIBLE] flow.

00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.705
You have flow.

00:20:59.705 --> 00:21:01.330
EARLL MURMAN: So
we've got a cell here.

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:02.090
We have a cell.

00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:03.798
CLAUDIO GELMAN: You
have a cell, exactly.

00:21:03.798 --> 00:21:06.985
EARLL MURMAN: I mean, this is a
very good graphical realization

00:21:06.985 --> 00:21:07.820
of a cell.

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.070
You can see it all
connected together.

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:11.570
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
That's a good point.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.060
This is a good
example of flowing,

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:18.037
and we ask them not to
have more than two pairs.

00:21:18.037 --> 00:21:20.120
EARLL MURMAN: It says right
there, two pairs only.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.620
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Two
pairs only, yes.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:26.923
EARLL MURMAN: And you got some
visual work instructions here.

00:21:26.923 --> 00:21:28.340
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Absolutely, that's

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:30.590
part of the standardized
work, where we

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:32.400
define the standardized width.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.220
And visual management
is a big part of it,

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:38.595
and if you have more, if I
see three pairs, you know,

00:21:38.595 --> 00:21:40.595
there's a problem because
the associate probably

00:21:40.595 --> 00:21:41.810
was having a problem.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.475
The flow coordinator,
or the-- we

00:21:43.475 --> 00:21:44.870
call the flow coordinator
the team leaders.

00:21:44.870 --> 00:21:46.120
We calling them
flow coordinators.

00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:46.630
EARLL MURMAN: Oh, they're
flow coordinators.

00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:48.230
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yeah, it's
the name we came up with.

00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:50.313
EARLL MURMAN: That's much
better than team leader,

00:21:50.313 --> 00:21:52.200
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yeah,
because their goal is

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.540
to maintain the flow, in a way.

00:21:53.540 --> 00:21:55.457
EARLL MURMAN: Well, the
title flow coordinator

00:21:55.457 --> 00:21:57.145
means-- a team leader
focuses on them.

00:21:57.145 --> 00:21:59.270
The flow coordinator focuses
on what they're doing.

00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:01.160
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Exactly, exactly.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.185
So visually, if you
see three pairs,

00:22:03.185 --> 00:22:04.810
the flow coordinator
will come and say,

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:06.590
something is not right.

00:22:06.590 --> 00:22:09.530
So visually, very powerful.

00:22:09.530 --> 00:22:11.930
EARLL MURMAN: So Claudio, I
see some little red dots here

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.310
where it says, red color label.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:14.270
What are those for?

00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:17.000
CLAUDIO GELMAN: It could be
that these machines sometimes

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.330
are very sensitive to
the shape of the part.

00:22:20.330 --> 00:22:23.630
Because you're taking a picture,
the part is sort of warped.

00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:26.840
It fools the machine, so
in shoe-making technology,

00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.190
it can have a stitch runoff.

00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:31.005
So they're searching
for a little red dot,

00:22:31.005 --> 00:22:33.230
and as it goes by,
the flow coordinator

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:36.097
will notice, fix it quickly,
and put it back into the line.

00:22:36.097 --> 00:22:38.180
EARLL MURMAN: Now, is that
something that came out

00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:39.618
of an employee suggestion?

00:22:39.618 --> 00:22:40.910
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Probably, yeah.

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:43.820
And they like to have that, and
they identify it themselves.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.977
At least, the defect is there,
but they take ownership.

00:22:46.977 --> 00:22:48.310
That's a big thing that changed.

00:22:48.310 --> 00:22:50.240
In the past, they
were just trying to,

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.040
you know-- we have inspectors
on the line put in the dots.

00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:55.580
Now, defects happen, but
now they have ownership.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:58.300
And we're very proud.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:04.040
It's really an environment that
it's OK to show their mistakes,

00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.330
and there's no problem.

00:23:05.330 --> 00:23:06.500
EARLL MURMAN: And
they're happy with that?

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:07.917
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Oh, not a problem.

00:23:07.917 --> 00:23:10.850
And interestingly, when
we changed from the batch

00:23:10.850 --> 00:23:14.250
to the lean, standards
are very important.

00:23:14.250 --> 00:23:17.722
Standardized work, which is
the definition of the best

00:23:17.722 --> 00:23:21.050
flow of a product, considering
cost, [INAUDIBLE],, economics.

00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:22.960
And some people
thought, well, if I

00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:26.270
have to do always
the same, management

00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.160
was concerned that
our associates

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.450
would feel like robots.

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:33.590
And the feedback that we
got after a few months

00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:36.170
of lean implementation
is that they

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:39.590
love to know what
they have to do,

00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:44.060
so management and even
human resource's concept

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.250
that they would feel like
robots was not correct.

00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:50.153
And what we're trying to
teach them is that instead

00:23:50.153 --> 00:23:52.070
of a paradox-- because
standardized work tells

00:23:52.070 --> 00:23:53.653
you, always have to
do the same thing,

00:23:53.653 --> 00:23:57.110
but as you do always
the same thing,

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.900
you have a foundation
for problem-solving

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:00.650
and for continuous improvement.

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:05.524
So standardized work is a
continuous improvement tool.

00:24:05.524 --> 00:24:07.420
It depends how you
look at things.

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.987
Through that repetition,
they will recommend changes.

00:24:09.987 --> 00:24:12.070
EARLL MURMAN: That's a
really interesting approach

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:15.200
because that makes standardized
work be something where you're

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.290
always trying to
improve it compared to,

00:24:17.290 --> 00:24:18.685
now we can forget about it.

00:24:18.685 --> 00:24:20.102
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Right, absolutely.

00:24:20.102 --> 00:24:21.910
But that's another thing.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.250
Sometimes, we go crazy,
and it never stops.

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:25.850
Once you've got
the stream rewired

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.780
for continuous improvement,
it never stops.

00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:34.540
Because of management, it
really changed radically.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:39.610
Managers become more
teachers and coaches.

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:41.963
Challenges, I
think, it's always--

00:24:41.963 --> 00:24:43.380
production managers,
we call them,

00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.370
they always have to
have gentle tension.

00:24:48.370 --> 00:24:52.150
In my experience of what I read,
you will not introduce lean

00:24:52.150 --> 00:24:53.650
with that tension.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:58.040
You know, I read somewhere else.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:24:59.900
This is like a pressure cooker.

00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:02.030
It's always pressure to
just release the pressure.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:03.020
EARLL MURMAN: Very
good analysis.

00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:03.330
CLAUDIO GELMAN: OK.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:04.356
EARLL MURMAN: Great.

00:25:04.356 --> 00:25:05.505
Maybe we should move on.

00:25:05.505 --> 00:25:06.880
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
Yes, so here, you

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.710
got the case ready for
the next department.

00:25:09.710 --> 00:25:11.405
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:25:11.405 --> 00:25:12.780
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
And the case will

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.510
be sent to the
stitching department,

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:16.920
so I think we should go around.

00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:18.270
And I'll show you
from the beginning.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.437
EARLL MURMAN: OK, very good.

00:25:23.693 --> 00:25:25.610
CLAUDIO GELMAN: We're
just going to go around.

00:25:25.610 --> 00:25:26.600
EARLL MURMAN: OK, good.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:45.700
Boy, a lot of
visual control here.

00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:48.910
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yes, so I
wanted to talk to you about that

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:53.750
before we talk about
the stitching cell.

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.300
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:57.090
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Takt time, flow.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:03.937
Flow coordinators are
required to keep details of--

00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:06.020
you have the exact idea
of the plan versus actual,

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.742
if there are any deviations.

00:26:07.742 --> 00:26:08.450
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.283
CLAUDIO GELMAN: This
is the production board

00:26:10.283 --> 00:26:12.710
for the last team that
we haven't talked yet,

00:26:12.710 --> 00:26:17.540
but if there is negative,
they have to put a reason.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.120
In this case, it was
waiting for the closing.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:21.200
Closing happened to be--

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.450
EARLL MURMAN: This is today's?

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:23.700
CLAUDIO GELMAN: This is today.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:25.624
EARLL MURMAN: So I
have five after 8:00,

00:26:25.624 --> 00:26:26.970
and this says 7:00 to 8 o'clock.

00:26:26.970 --> 00:26:28.910
So immediately,
this was filled in.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:29.200
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yes.

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:30.650
EARLL MURMAN: Because we're
now on this shift here.

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.480
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Right, and
we'll see what happened.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.188
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:26:33.188 --> 00:26:34.838
CLAUDIO GELMAN: OK?

00:26:34.838 --> 00:26:36.330
Yeah, that's a good observation.

00:26:36.330 --> 00:26:41.475
So for supervisors,
managers, you come here,

00:26:41.475 --> 00:26:43.100
and you know we're
waiting for closing.

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:46.070
So the first
question I will have,

00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:49.190
what happened in closing
and the stitching?

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:52.640
You have a board there that
then the flow coordinator says,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.720
machine number seven
was down for 10 minutes.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:55.428
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:26:55.428 --> 00:26:57.740
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Just
big picture detail.

00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.900
On their desk, they
have a more detailed log

00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:01.275
that will tell
them what happened

00:27:01.275 --> 00:27:02.870
with that particular
machine, but you

00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:04.070
see how they're connected.

00:27:04.070 --> 00:27:05.320
EARLL MURMAN: Very, very good.

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.903
CLAUDIO GELMAN: And it's part
of the supervisor and management

00:27:07.903 --> 00:27:09.573
to make sure that
they make sense.

00:27:09.573 --> 00:27:10.490
EARLL MURMAN: Morning.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:12.220
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: [INAUDIBLE]
broken the thread.

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:12.780
Good morning.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:13.280
How are you?

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.140
EARLL MURMAN: Good.

00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:15.140
CLAUDIO GELMAN: You see?

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.190
They've broken the thread.

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.880
ROSE MARY MUNOZ:
Broken the thread.

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.390
CLAUDIO GELMAN: That's why--

00:27:17.390 --> 00:27:18.210
EARLL MURMAN: Oh,
the thread broke?

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:18.720
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
The thread broke.

00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:19.780
That's what we're talking about.

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:20.590
She knows about it.

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:21.290
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: I
told [INAUDIBLE]..

00:27:21.290 --> 00:27:21.985
CLAUDIO GELMAN: OK.

00:27:21.985 --> 00:27:22.860
EARLL MURMAN: Is she
the flow coordinator?

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:24.318
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
She's a supervisor,

00:27:24.318 --> 00:27:25.460
25 years in the company.

00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:25.820
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.480
CLAUDIO GELMAN: What an asset.

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.990
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: That's my team.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.030
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah,
so this her team.

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:29.480
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: Uh-huh.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.147
EARLL MURMAN: I saw
you're way up there.

00:27:31.147 --> 00:27:31.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:35.480
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So like
we were talking before,

00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:38.090
we talked about the [INAUDIBLE]
generation, problem-solving,

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.780
involvement, and we
have a very simple way

00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:46.817
to appreciate the associates.

00:27:46.817 --> 00:27:48.650
To talk about interaction
between supervisor

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:51.260
and associates, I will introduce
to you Rose Mary Munoz.

00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.890
She's our supervisor--

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:53.190
EARLL MURMAN: Buenos dias.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:54.398
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: Buenos dias.

00:27:54.398 --> 00:27:54.980
Como estas?

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:56.060
CLAUDIO GELMAN: --in
the wide value stream.

00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:57.690
She's been with a
company 25 years.

00:27:57.690 --> 00:27:58.440
EARLL MURMAN: Wow.

00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.050
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So
she's seen a lot

00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:04.743
from the batch and
queue world to the--

00:28:04.743 --> 00:28:05.660
EARLL MURMAN: It's OK.

00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:08.240
CLAUDIO GELMAN: --from the batch
and queue world to the lean

00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.360
world, so any questions
you want to ask her, it's--

00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.690
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah,
Rose Mary, it's

00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.970
really critical-- in
transformation to lean,

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:19.005
the people are really,
to me, the key part,

00:28:19.005 --> 00:28:19.850
the critical part.

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:20.060
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: Uh-huh.

00:28:20.060 --> 00:28:22.140
EARLL MURMAN: And you're
a front-line supervisor,

00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.690
and you have a value stream.

00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.690
I guess this is a picture
of your value stream here.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.040
Yours is the gold value stream.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.040
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: Uh-huh.

00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.498
EARLL MURMAN: So as supervisor,
what are some of the things

00:28:31.498 --> 00:28:34.112
that you do when you work
with your value stream team?

00:28:34.112 --> 00:28:35.570
ROSE MARY MUNOZ:
The most important

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:39.830
is to work with the
associates because lean

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:46.550
is 90% associates and
10% the rest, material

00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:47.870
or maybe supervisor.

00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:52.670
They're the most important
ones to introduce lean system,

00:28:52.670 --> 00:28:54.500
and they understand
what they're doing.

00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:56.150
That's the most
important thing that we

00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:58.810
can do to get that [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:00.560
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah,
Claudio was telling me

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.510
that one of the ways
you do this is you

00:29:02.510 --> 00:29:04.120
get suggestions from them.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.100
You engage them
with suggestions.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:10.678
So Rhea here, she's contributed
some kinds of suggestions,

00:29:10.678 --> 00:29:12.220
and what happens to
those suggestions

00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:13.480
when she contributes them?

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.022
ROSE MARY MUNOZ:
The suggestions they

00:29:15.022 --> 00:29:19.200
give, we check if--
we try to implement

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.100
all the ideas that they have.

00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:24.200
When they give me some
idea, we try to implement.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.000
We work with them, and
that way they feel more--

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:32.020
how I can say it?

00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.187
EARLL MURMAN: More involved?

00:29:33.187 --> 00:29:35.980
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: More
involved in helping the team.

00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:36.940
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.760
CLAUDIO GELMAN: How do you
help them with the idea?

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:43.267
Do you help them think to it,
or do they come up with idea

00:29:43.267 --> 00:29:43.850
by themselves?

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:46.350
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: No, they came
up with the idea by themself.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:49.810
And when they don't have
no idea, I go with them,

00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:53.000
and I would say, for
example, what do you think?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.140
You don't have no idea
how you can get any ideas?

00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.260
Sometimes, they say, oh, maybe
I don't have too many time

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:00.680
to think and
something like that.

00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.500
I told her, what
do you think if we

00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.900
had put, for example, the
[INAUDIBLE] here close to you?

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.510
You can save one second.

00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:08.410
I said [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:09.190
That's fine [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.773
We can try it.

00:30:09.773 --> 00:30:13.275
They all try anything
that I can help them do.

00:30:13.275 --> 00:30:14.650
EARLL MURMAN: So
as a supervisor,

00:30:14.650 --> 00:30:18.270
what's the biggest challenge
you have in this job?

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:20.102
I mean, you've got 25 people.

00:30:20.102 --> 00:30:21.398
That's a lot right there.

00:30:21.398 --> 00:30:22.690
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: Work together.

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:23.000
EARLL MURMAN: Work together.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.453
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: And teamwork,
that's the most important.

00:30:25.453 --> 00:30:26.911
When we're all
working like a team,

00:30:26.911 --> 00:30:28.780
you can get anything
you want [INAUDIBLE]..

00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.863
EARLL MURMAN: Well, super.

00:30:29.863 --> 00:30:31.368
Well, let's go back
in the factory.

00:30:31.368 --> 00:30:32.660
You've got a lot of work to do.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.440
ROSE MARY MUNOZ: Yeah.

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:33.830
Thank you.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:34.600
EARLL MURMAN: OK, thank you.

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:35.683
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Thank you.

00:30:35.683 --> 00:30:39.065
So this one's called stitching.

00:30:39.065 --> 00:30:40.440
Before in the
computer stitching,

00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.170
the upper was in the flat form.

00:30:43.170 --> 00:30:46.692
Here is the first time
the upper takes a 3D form.

00:30:46.692 --> 00:30:47.400
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:53.520
CLAUDIO GELMAN: So it's a cell,
and basically, it will follow--

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.840
something stopped here.

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.950
You have to understand.

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:57.180
You will follow
these [INAUDIBLE]----

00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:57.972
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:04.860
CLAUDIO GELMAN: --to feed
to what we call the assembly

00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:05.550
department.

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:05.940
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.380
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
What is the sole.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:08.160
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.285
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Still, in
the stitching department,

00:31:10.285 --> 00:31:12.840
you still have continuous flow.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:16.500
If you looked
between the station

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.810
to upper, to upper, to
upper, that associate

00:31:19.810 --> 00:31:23.190
just noticed he did not put
another shoe on that tray

00:31:23.190 --> 00:31:24.420
until one was removed.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.710
EARLL MURMAN: The combine, OK.

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:26.130
Flow.

00:31:26.130 --> 00:31:27.450
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Exactly,
so they're pulling--

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:28.380
EARLL MURMAN: Pulling, yeah.

00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.797
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
--very frequently.

00:31:29.797 --> 00:31:32.380
That discipline is
very, very important.

00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:34.050
You don't want that
overproduction.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:34.770
EARLL MURMAN: You're right.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:36.240
There are two there, two there.

00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:37.040
CLAUDIO GELMAN: And
you still have--

00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.160
they were stopped.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:38.290
EARLL MURMAN: I
just saw the switch.

00:31:38.290 --> 00:31:39.570
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yeah,
and they were stopped.

00:31:39.570 --> 00:31:41.403
EARLL MURMAN: As soon
as she pulled one off,

00:31:41.403 --> 00:31:42.630
he put one there.

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:44.880
CLAUDIO GELMAN: It takes
months and years to get that,

00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.350
but they understand.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:50.020
They understand that the
shoes are not going anywhere

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:50.880
if they overproduce.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:52.980
EARLL MURMAN: You know,
it looks like a symphony.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.095
Everybody's playing together.

00:31:55.095 --> 00:31:55.970
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yeah.

00:31:55.970 --> 00:31:57.740
Yes, exactly.

00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:58.370
It's a takt.

00:31:58.370 --> 00:32:01.124
It's like a rhythm.

00:32:01.124 --> 00:32:06.128
The shoe circulates
to the department.

00:32:06.128 --> 00:32:06.670
They stopped.

00:32:06.670 --> 00:32:08.680
That's why they don't
have a shoe here.

00:32:08.680 --> 00:32:11.380
The associate will put a--

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:14.500
and basically, the
department is--

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:16.030
there are two basic operations.

00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:19.940
It's called the last
thing, where you--

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:20.940
this is called the last.

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:21.670
EARLL MURMAN: The last, OK.

00:32:21.670 --> 00:32:23.003
CLAUDIO GELMAN: You have a last.

00:32:23.003 --> 00:32:25.802
This is a style, and you
have a last per the foot.

00:32:25.802 --> 00:32:27.010
The foots are very different.

00:32:27.010 --> 00:32:27.814
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:32:27.814 --> 00:32:28.740
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:30.190
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Then they have--

00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:31.540
the width is David.

00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.430
That's D. It's called David.

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:36.590
New Balance
specializes in width,

00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:41.590
so this particular shoe goes
from B, very narrow, to a 6E,

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:42.580
very wide.

00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:47.120
And each foot requires
a different last.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.600
EARLL MURMAN: So how do
we know when the shoes are

00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.870
going through this cell that--

00:32:51.870 --> 00:32:54.640
are they making it for
a particular size last?

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.910
CLAUDIO GELMAN: There
is a document that

00:32:57.910 --> 00:33:00.520
is printed every
day and distributed

00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.240
to all the supervisors
per value stream

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.865
that they know
exactly the sequence,

00:33:06.865 --> 00:33:08.510
so he knows very well.

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:10.240
The flow coordinators
in this teams

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.545
knows very well what's coming.

00:33:11.545 --> 00:33:13.462
EARLL MURMAN: So that's
done on a daily basis,

00:33:13.462 --> 00:33:15.880
so you're really responding
on almost a daily basis

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.233
to the pull in customer?

00:33:17.233 --> 00:33:18.150
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Right.

00:33:18.150 --> 00:33:19.130
Yeah, it's a daily.

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:21.605
Yeah, daily.

00:33:21.605 --> 00:33:22.480
Sometimes are weekly.

00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:25.740
Sometimes are daily,
but we know exactly.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.460
At the end of the
day or the afternoon

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:31.000
before, it gets put
in these documents.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.100
EARLL MURMAN: Is that
based on the orders that

00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:34.450
are coming in for shoes?

00:33:34.450 --> 00:33:35.680
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yeah, it
depends on the work orders.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.930
Some shoes are go
directly to customers.

00:33:37.930 --> 00:33:41.140
Some orders go to the warehouse.

00:33:41.140 --> 00:33:43.870
It depends who they are for.

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:47.020
It can be a weekly work
order or a daily work order.

00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.290
Regardless of that,
this document is daily,

00:33:50.290 --> 00:33:52.690
and it gets distributed,
again, to the supervisor, flow

00:33:52.690 --> 00:33:54.190
coordinator, and set-up people.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.310
Set-up people are the
ones that bring the work.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:59.150
So there's no question.

00:33:59.150 --> 00:34:01.840
So in the case of the
last, the set-up person

00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:05.530
will have a document, so
there's no need to talk.

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:09.110
Every single transaction is
very clear who's responsible,

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:10.485
what needs to be done.

00:34:10.485 --> 00:34:12.610
EARLL MURMAN: This must
give you a competitive edge

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:16.060
over your competitors
whose shoes are

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:17.800
being made in another country.

00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:19.870
And the market is
here, and there's

00:34:19.870 --> 00:34:23.800
a time lag between those two.

00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:26.199
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yes, it is.

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:30.400
We're working right now with
our lead time of three days.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:33.550
It's to try to help the
retailers to minimize

00:34:33.550 --> 00:34:36.949
the inventory, so
it started Friday.

00:34:36.949 --> 00:34:38.739
Saturdays and
Sundays are big days.

00:34:38.739 --> 00:34:40.540
On Monday, they place an order.

00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:43.136
Three days later, we can
deliver it back to them.

00:34:43.136 --> 00:34:45.219
EARLL MURMAN: And this
lady is doing it right now.

00:34:45.219 --> 00:34:46.219
She's--

00:34:46.219 --> 00:34:46.719
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Absolutely.

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:47.719
EARLL MURMAN:
Real-time response.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:48.219
OK, cool.

00:34:48.219 --> 00:34:50.719
CLAUDIO GELMAN: This is to be
in a customer in three or four

00:34:50.719 --> 00:34:54.750
days, and that makes
a big difference.

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:59.667
Basically, in this
department, these associates--

00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:01.875
the shoe is put into what's
called a conditioner just

00:35:01.875 --> 00:35:04.300
to get some steam to
soften up a little bit.

00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:10.140
So when he removes a
last, puts on the paint,

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:15.320
and put the shoe on, it
flexes [INAUDIBLE] to fit.

00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.630
The shoe gets cemented
on the bottom.

00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:19.760
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:24.040
CLAUDIO GELMAN: The sole
is the layer from behind.

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:28.680
The associates with that
yellow machine over there,

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:30.660
basically, what it does
is activates-- maybe

00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.880
I'll show you a little
more closely here.

00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.635
So the shoe is cemented.

00:35:34.635 --> 00:35:37.202
It's put in this big dryer--

00:35:37.202 --> 00:35:37.910
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:38.952
CLAUDIO GELMAN: --to dry.

00:35:38.952 --> 00:35:41.102
The sole underneath,
this comes from behind.

00:35:41.102 --> 00:35:41.810
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.870
CLAUDIO GELMAN: The right
sole for the right upper.

00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:47.225
The cement gets a little
bit of heat in that--

00:35:47.225 --> 00:35:48.350
EARLL MURMAN: In that oven?

00:35:48.350 --> 00:35:50.720
CLAUDIO GELMAN: It's
called a activator oven.

00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:55.850
Then the associate will get the
upper and the sole activated.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:35:59.450
They will stick it together,
put it in this big press

00:35:59.450 --> 00:36:02.690
where the shoe stays for two
minutes to ensure bonding.

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:04.010
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.470
CLAUDIO GELMAN: And
then goes to our table

00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:10.280
where the packing associates
will do some basic inspections,

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.010
will remove any
cement, will apply

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:17.180
the laces, any tags,
advertisements.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:21.928
Some tissue inside the shoe to
keep its shape inside the box.

00:36:21.928 --> 00:36:22.840
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:23.590
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Get packed.

00:36:23.590 --> 00:36:24.490
EARLL MURMAN: And that's it.

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:25.740
CLAUDIO GELMAN: And that's it.

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.400
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so Claudio,
this now goes to your customer,

00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:28.960
and if I--

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:29.400
CLAUDIO GELMAN: Yeah.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:32.005
EARLL MURMAN: If I go to a New
Balance outlet or a shoe store,

00:36:32.005 --> 00:36:32.630
I can buy this.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:33.880
CLAUDIO GELMAN: You'll see
those shoes, absolutely.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.630
EARLL MURMAN: Claudio,
thanks so much for showing--

00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:36.280
CLAUDIO GELMAN: It's
been a pleasure.

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.280
Really, a pleasure.

00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:38.230
EARLL MURMAN: And you
know, as we're leaving,

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.063
I kind of want to know,
what's the next step

00:36:40.063 --> 00:36:41.290
in your lean journey?

00:36:41.290 --> 00:36:42.665
CLAUDIO GELMAN:
It's interesting.

00:36:42.665 --> 00:36:47.900
The answer is more of the
same, but what I mean by that--

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.600
everything is
about the thinking.

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.430
So what we'll do, we will work
in more sophisticated problems.

00:36:54.430 --> 00:36:57.890
We continue sharpening our
problem-solving skills,

00:36:57.890 --> 00:37:01.390
so we will be able to resolve
more complicated waste

00:37:01.390 --> 00:37:02.940
problems.

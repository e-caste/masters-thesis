JONATHAN GRUBER:
Today, we're going

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.730
to finish our
discussion of savings,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.070
continue my nagging
on you guys about how

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.570
you should be saving money.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.237
And then we're going
to move on and talk

00:00:21.237 --> 00:00:22.480
about international trade.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.230
So let's finish our
discussion of savings.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.970
Now, savings turns out to be
a critically important element

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.720
of growth in the economy.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.310
And we've now traced
through why that happens.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.780
Our basic story is
as savings goes up,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.870
that means that the
capital supply shifts out.

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.800
So the capital
supply curve shifts

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.273
outward as people save more.

00:00:57.273 --> 00:00:58.940
That's an increase
in the capital supply

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.900
curve in the capital markets.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.590
That means that
interest rates fall.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.870
Because there's more
supply for given demand,

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.550
the price is going to fall.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.280
The price of capital
is the interest rate.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.645
So as people save more,
that's more supply

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:15.790
into capital markets.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.510
It's increasing the pool from
which firms have to borrow.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.580
For a given pool, firms
have to pay less money

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.560
to borrow from that.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.050
If the interest rate
goes down, that means

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.510
the NPV of investment
goes up, because remember,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.240
the net present
value of investments

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.350
is a negative function
of the interest rate.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.750
The lower the interest
rate, the more firms

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.333
will say I might as well buy a
new machine, because the bank's

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.160
not paying anything.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.450
That means that NPV
investment goes up,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.770
which means investment goes up.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.760
So the bottom line
is, the way we

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.670
get firms to invest
more and grow

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.940
the economy is by saving more.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.140
We save more.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.150
We increase capital supply.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.190
That lowers the interest rate.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.930
That raises the
NPV of investment,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.759
which leads to more investment.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.440
So that's the link by which
savings lead economic growth,

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:16.430
is that savings leads
firms to invest more.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.740
Is that clear from
the sort of structure

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.815
we built in the last
couple lectures?

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:22.190
If it's not, just
go back through

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.510
and work through the math.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.718
But you'll see we talked
about the capital market.

00:02:25.718 --> 00:02:28.010
The interest rates, the price,
and the capital market--

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.845
last time we talked about
the lower the interest rate,

00:02:31.845 --> 00:02:34.220
the higher the net present
value of any given investment.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.440
That means firms
will invest more.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.680
So that means a critical
public policy concern is

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.030
getting people to save enough.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.590
Now, obviously, that varies
with economic conditions.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.260
In a deep recession, we don't
naturally want as much savings

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.670
as when we're not in recession.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.630
But in general, in the long run,
we will grow more as an economy

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.150
if we save more as a society.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.107
And the US has an
incredible low savings rate.

00:02:58.107 --> 00:03:00.440
Our savings rate in the US,
depending how you define it,

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.300
is maybe 3% to 5%.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.520
In Europe, in Japan, it's
like 15-plus percent.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.160
So we have a very
low savings rate.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.120
And as a result, that has
led public policymakers

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.260
to try to think about tools they
can use to encourage savings.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.420
And the major tool we
use in public policy

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:26.840
to encourage savings is the tax
subsidy to retirement savings.

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.930
The tax subsidy to
retirement savings

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.830
is the major tool that we use
to increase savings in the US.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.500
Now, how does this work?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.000
The basic logic
is the following--

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.620
When I put my money in the
bank and I earn interest,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.360
that interest gets taxed.

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.250
Just like my labor
supply gets taxed,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.280
my capital income gets taxed.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.190
So when I put money in
the bank, I don't just

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.390
earn the interest rate.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.360
We'll use our-- we don't care
about real interest rate.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.810
[INAUDIBLE] earn interest rate.

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.010
I earn r times 1 minus tau,
where tau is the tax rate.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.350
That's all I take home.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:14.100
So the bank pays me 10%.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.100
Say inflation is zero,
so nominal interest rates

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:17.029
are the same.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.420
If the bank pays me 10%
and my tax rate's 50%,

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.810
I only take home 5% on that.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.270
If we assume substitution
effects dominate--

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.140
which is a big assumption,
but typically one we make--

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.310
this means the taxation, by
lowering the return to savings,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.710
will lead to less savings.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.910
So by taxing people's savings,
we lead to less of it,

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:46.310
because we sort of assume
substitution effects dominate.

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.450
To offset this, we say,
well, I'll tell you what--

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.280
if you save for retirement,
we won't tax it.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.490
So if you save it, and
you pull it out next year,

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.230
we're going to tax
it, but if you put it

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:03.250
in special accounts which we've
labeled as retirement savings,

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.590
we won't tax it.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.660
So these have a number of forms.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.660
One form is employer
sponsored pensions.

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:12.160
These are things
where your employer

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.280
takes some of your pay,
puts it aside in an account.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.870
And when he does that,
you're not taxed on that pay.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.670
So if MIT is going
to pay me $100,000,

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.130
and they pull $10,000 aside
and put it in a pension,

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.780
I'm only taxed on $90,000.

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.710
That $10,000 isn't taxed.

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:30.710
And likewise, the interest
that's earned on that

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.870
isn't taxed.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.720
There's also 401(k)s.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.850
A 401(k) is like a pension, but
where you control the money.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:43.280
So when you get a job, you
might get offered a 401(k).

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.140
That's something where
some of your money

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:46.670
gets pulled out of your salary.

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.010
It doesn't get taxed, and
it gets saved instead,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.670
and you control where it goes.

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.530
And then we also have
individual retirement accounts,

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:58.562
with the unfortunate name IRA.

00:05:58.562 --> 00:06:00.020
It's not the Irish
Republican Army,

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.650
but individual retirement
accounts, which are similar

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.630
features, where you
could take your money

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.190
and save it on a tax-free basis.

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.730
Now here's the trick about
how all these things work, is

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:15.770
they're not actually tax free.

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:16.945
They are tax deferred.

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.940
And what do I mean by that?

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:26.920
What I mean by that is that
when you take the money out

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.410
eventually, it does get taxed.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:31.620
So the way, say, your
401(k) would work--

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.890
you get a job at
whatever, Google.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:38.110
Google offers you a 401(k).

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.240
You put money in it.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.097
That money then accumulates.

00:06:42.097 --> 00:06:43.930
And when you take it
out-- you put money in.

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.932
That money is not taxed
when you put it in,

00:06:45.932 --> 00:06:47.515
but when you take
it out, it is taxed.

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.960
So it is eventually taxed.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.003
So what good does that do you?

00:06:55.003 --> 00:06:56.670
What good does that
do you if it's going

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:58.190
to get taxed eventually anyway?

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:58.690
Yeah.

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.482
AUDIENCE: If you don't
get taxed right now,

00:07:00.482 --> 00:07:03.170
you get more money now, which
will then accumulate more money

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.692
through compound interest.

00:07:04.692 --> 00:07:05.650
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:07.242
It takes advantage
of present value.

00:07:07.242 --> 00:07:08.950
Remember, we talked
about this last time.

00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.920
With present value, money in the
future is worth less than money

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.850
today.

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:15.760
By that same logic,
paying taxes in the future

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.715
costs you less than
paying taxes today,

00:07:18.715 --> 00:07:19.840
because you have the money.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:21.640
You can earn all
this interest on it,

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.280
and you have to pay taxes
on it off in the future.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.350
So let's see an example of that.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:29.400
Let's look at figure 18.1.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.560
Let's say you have two types
of accounts, a regular account,

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.100
or an IRA account, which
is a tax-deferred account.

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.240
And let's say the
tax rate is 25%

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:42.922
and the interest rate is 10%.

00:07:42.922 --> 00:07:45.130
And let's say you're just
going to put the money in--

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:47.140
to make life easy, imagine
put the money in for one year.

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.720
Imagine you're
retiring next year.

00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.390
This is a super easy example.

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.570
You're retiring next year.

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:53.820
The question is, for
this last year of work,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.700
should you put your money
in a tax-deferred account

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:59.800
or in a regular account?

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.240
If you put it in
a regular account,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.180
you will take your $100 of
earnings to pay $25 of taxes

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.530
right away.

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:10.420
You only get to put $75 in.

00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:14.200
On that $75, you'll earn $7.50.

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.785
And when you take the $7.50
out, you'll pay $1.88 in taxes.

00:08:17.785 --> 00:08:19.690
So you pay $25 on your earnings.

00:08:19.690 --> 00:08:22.490
You pay another $1.88 on
the interest you earned.

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:26.150
And you end up with $80.62.

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:28.220
Now let's say instead,
you set up an IRA.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.720
There, you get to put
the whole $100 in.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:34.630
That $100 earns $10.

00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:37.885
And when you take out $110,
then you pay tax on it,

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:41.039
so you pay $27.50,
then, in the end.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.570
But if you put it all together,
you end up with more money--

00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:47.470
$82.50 rather than $80.62.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.620
Why is that?

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:52.350
It's because you delayed
paying taxes by a year.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:55.828
By paying taxes
one year later, you

00:08:55.828 --> 00:08:58.120
got to earn the interest on
that money during the year.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.970
Think of it this way--
if you pay taxes now,

00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.553
the government gets
the money and they

00:09:01.553 --> 00:09:02.850
get to earn interest on it.

00:09:02.850 --> 00:09:05.160
If you pay taxes next
year, you keep the money

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.010
and you earn interest on it.

00:09:07.010 --> 00:09:09.008
So it's much better
to pay taxes later,

00:09:09.008 --> 00:09:10.550
and that's why these
accounts matter.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.240
It's a simple example.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.760
It's a simple example.

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:19.890
If you have a 30-year account,
if we kept the interest

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.740
rate at 10% and the
tax rate at 25%,

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.380
and did a 30-year
calculation, you

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:27.593
would have twice as much
money after 30 years,

00:09:27.593 --> 00:09:29.510
if you put it in an IRA
rather than putting it

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:31.470
in a regular bank account.

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.420
So even though it
eventually gets taxed,

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.040
it's a big advantage.

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.760
It's a big advantage.

00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:43.390
And that's why public policy
introduced these tools--

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:47.080
401(k)s, pensions, IRAs--
because they're trying

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.130
to encourage saving by
raising the return to saving.

00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:53.960
And they hope that by
encouraging saving,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.580
they'll get all this good
stuff coming out of it.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.860
So that's why these
things come up.

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:05.490
So the first lesson is, just
like my continued nag on you,

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:07.880
is save early and save often.

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.190
Things like 401(k)s, by
putting your money away,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.273
not only do you get the
compounding I talked about

00:10:12.273 --> 00:10:15.730
before, but you also get the tax
benefit of paying taxes later

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.140
rather than sooner.

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.700
You get the compounding
on the money

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.760
and the compounding
on the taxes.

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.280
So these kinds of retirement
accounts, when you get your job

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.260
and you're thinking about why
would I worry about retirement,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:27.610
worry about retirement.

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.220
There's a big advantage.

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:32.960
Then you ask, that's
fine, John, but when

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.050
I get my 401(k) paperwork,
I've got like a million things

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.190
I could invest in.

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.408
What I do with the money?

00:10:38.408 --> 00:10:39.950
So let's talk for
a couple of minutes

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:44.482
about investment strategy, about
what you do with the money.

00:10:44.482 --> 00:10:46.190
So let's think about
three different ways

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:50.120
you can invest your retirement
money, three class of options

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:52.330
a 401(k) will typically have.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:11:02.840
They'll typically be a money
market fund, a bond fund,

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:05.230
and a stock fund.

00:11:05.230 --> 00:11:07.230
And there will be various
combinations of these,

00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:08.580
but these are the categories.

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.990
What do these mean?

00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:16.787
Money market means the money is
invested in government bonds.

00:11:16.787 --> 00:11:18.870
The money is invested in
what are called "Treasury

00:11:18.870 --> 00:11:21.850
securities," government bonds.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:26.320
These are things which are ultra
safe, as long as the US doesn't

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.960
default on its debt, which
we've never done in our history

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.860
and, the good Lord willing,
won't do in the near term.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.520
Because the US doesn't default
on its debt, you get paid back.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.240
These are super safe, the safest
place you can put your money.

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.972
But they pay a very
low interest rate.

00:11:42.972 --> 00:11:44.680
Right now, they're
paying interest rates,

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.480
a typical government
bond fund right now

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:52.270
would be paying interest rate
of around maybe 2%, maybe

00:11:52.270 --> 00:11:53.840
1% to 2%--

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.975
very low interest
rate, maybe up to 3%

00:11:55.975 --> 00:12:00.820
now, but very, very low single
digits, but totally safe.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:06.280
A bond fund invests your
money in corporate bonds.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:09.488
Basically, this is making
loans to corporations.

00:12:09.488 --> 00:12:11.280
Instead of loaning
money to the government,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.053
you loan the money
to a corporation.

00:12:14.053 --> 00:12:15.720
You're not actually
buying a bond in GM.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.810
That's too hard.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.080
So what these 401(k)
accounts do is they say,

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.580
we're going to buy
a bunch of bonds.

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.288
We're going to put
them together, and let

00:12:22.288 --> 00:12:24.490
you own a small piece of
that entire set of bonds.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.730
That's what a bond fund is.

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:29.770
So you own a small piece of
bunch of corporate bonds.

00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:31.550
The difference is,
unlike the government,

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.920
corporations do go out
of business all the time.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.560
So these are riskier.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:41.720
These are riskier, but they
pay a higher interest rate.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.150
Bond funds typically
paying 4% to 5% right now.

00:12:46.405 --> 00:12:48.655
Then finally, the last thing
you can do with the money

00:12:48.655 --> 00:12:50.260
is you can put in stocks.

00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:53.470
You could literally
own corporate equity.

00:12:53.470 --> 00:12:56.740
You could own a
piece of companies.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:59.490
You could own a piece
of the companies,

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:03.070
and then what you get
is you get something,

00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:04.145
it doesn't really matter.

00:13:04.145 --> 00:13:05.520
With these two,
it only matters--

00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:07.750
you get paid as long as the
government or the company

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:09.120
doesn't go out of business.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:12.670
Here you get paid in proportion
to how well the company does.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:15.150
If it does really well,
you make a lot of money.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:16.505
Stock prices go up.

00:13:16.505 --> 00:13:17.880
If it goes badly,
you lose money.

00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.325
It goes bankrupt,
you lose everything.

00:13:20.325 --> 00:13:21.950
So similar to these,
in the bankruptcy,

00:13:21.950 --> 00:13:22.970
it costs you everything.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:24.980
The difference is these,
either you get paid

00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:25.910
or you go bankrupt.

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.890
Here, it's much more variable.

00:13:27.890 --> 00:13:29.570
Things do well, you get more.

00:13:29.570 --> 00:13:31.140
Things go badly, you get less.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.380
So this is the
riskiest option of all,

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:36.930
but it also pays the
highest rate of return.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:40.050
Traditionally, stock investments
pay a long rate of return

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:43.498
about 7% a year.

00:13:43.498 --> 00:13:45.540
So what we see here when
we compare these is what

00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:51.950
economists call the
"risk-return trade-off."

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:02.190
The riskier things
are, the higher

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.610
you earn by investing
in them, but the riskier

00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:06.360
that earnings is.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.860
The more [INAUDIBLE]
invest in them,

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.530
but the riskier
that earnings is.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.190
That in other words, people
are willing to accept a lower

00:14:14.190 --> 00:14:16.200
interest rate for
a safe investment

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.570
than they want for
a risky investment.

00:14:19.570 --> 00:14:22.780
And we'll talk about, in
two lectures from now,

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.035
why that is, why people's
preferences are that way.

00:14:25.035 --> 00:14:27.160
It's because people are
what we call "risk averse."

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.535
People don't like
risk, and we'll

00:14:28.535 --> 00:14:32.720
talk about why that's
a natural way to be.

00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:36.740
So basically, that is
your set of choices.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:40.700
And what economists
recommend is that the key

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:44.180
in all of these investments
is to diversify.

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:45.860
The key recommendation
of economists

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:54.180
is diversification, that
you spread your money

00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:56.910
across these options to get
the right balance of risk

00:14:56.910 --> 00:14:59.860
and return.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.693
So that basically, if
you're someone who--

00:15:04.693 --> 00:15:06.860
now, how you balance depends
on your taste for risk.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.277
For someone who
really hates risk,

00:15:08.277 --> 00:15:09.910
you put most of your money here.

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.160
But it's silly to put all
your money in money markets,

00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.930
because you're losing
a lot of return.

00:15:13.930 --> 00:15:15.430
If you're someone
who's risk loving,

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:17.380
you might want to put most
of your money in stocks.

00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.797
But still don't
put all your money

00:15:18.797 --> 00:15:21.040
in stocks, because you
have a much higher risk.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.180
You want some safety
behind you as well.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.690
So an economist would
say you should diversify.

00:15:26.690 --> 00:15:27.860
Now, that's a general.

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.213
I can't tell you what percentage
is the right percentages.

00:15:31.213 --> 00:15:32.380
I can tell you to diversify.

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:36.180
But I can give you one
specific piece of advice--

00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:38.890
that when you go
work for Company X,

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:41.530
the one thing you
do not want to do

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:44.850
is put your money in
the stock of Company X.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.590
Why is that?

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.090
Why is the last
thing you want to do

00:15:49.090 --> 00:15:52.420
when you go to work for Company
X to put a bunch of your money

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:54.580
in the stock of Company X?

00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:55.192
Yeah.

00:15:55.192 --> 00:15:56.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.570
JONATHAN GRUBER:
No, this would be

00:15:58.570 --> 00:16:00.070
through a 401(k) [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.140
It wouldn't be like that.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:01.692
Yeah.

00:16:01.692 --> 00:16:04.498
AUDIENCE: If you lose your job,
or if the company shuts down,

00:16:04.498 --> 00:16:06.250
you can lose both your
job and the money.

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:09.850
JONATHAN GRUBER: That is the
maximally risky strategy,

00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.610
because you are tying your
risk of your investments

00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:15.600
to your risk of your salary.

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.270
That's the most risky
thing you can do.

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:22.210
So absolutely what you
would not want to do

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.710
is go work for
Google and say, good,

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.010
I'm going to put all my
retirement in Google stock.

00:16:26.010 --> 00:16:28.480
You might think Googles
safe, but safer companies

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.068
than Google--

00:16:29.068 --> 00:16:31.360
companies thought to be safer
than Google at some point

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:32.770
have gone bankrupt.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:35.770
Google is bankrupt,
you're totally screwed.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.997
You've lost all your
savings and your job,

00:16:37.997 --> 00:16:39.580
so the last thing
you want do is that.

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:41.606
Yeah.

00:16:41.606 --> 00:16:43.876
AUDIENCE: If you're in a
more corporate position,

00:16:43.876 --> 00:16:46.022
and they gave you
bonds as promises.

00:16:46.022 --> 00:16:48.480
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well, I mean,
certainly a lot of companies

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.563
give you stock options,
where you're sort of stuck

00:16:50.563 --> 00:16:51.870
in the stock of that company.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:53.250
And my lesson there
would be, that's

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:55.375
part of the conversation,
but as soon as it's best,

00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:57.440
sell it and get out.

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.040
That doesn't mean
you shouldn't--

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.040
you should value-- it's
not saying stock options

00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.440
in the company are worthless.

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.440
They're worth something.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.390
It's just they're worth less
than if they just gave you

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:06.930
the cash, because
if you got the cash,

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:08.430
you'd go invest it
in somewhere that

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:10.770
wouldn't be tied to your job.

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.829
And this came to a head with
the example of Enron, which

00:17:13.829 --> 00:17:15.589
is sort of before your time.

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:17.069
That's sort of when
you were young.

00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:20.460
But basically, Enron
was an energy company

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.490
that got into some
really shady dealings

00:17:23.490 --> 00:17:26.194
to try to essentially
prop up its stock price.

00:17:26.194 --> 00:17:28.319
To make itself look valuable
it essentially created

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:31.410
shell companies that were the
same company it sold to them.

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.535
So it looked like it was
generating a lot of sales,

00:17:33.535 --> 00:17:35.280
but it was just
selling to itself.

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.500
It was illegal activity.

00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:40.140
But it caused their stock
price to go through the roof.

00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:43.195
And Enron, in order to have
enough money in the company,

00:17:43.195 --> 00:17:45.570
encouraged their employees to
invest all their retirement

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:46.530
savings at Enron.

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:49.380
Indeed, the Enron
401(k) said, we'll

00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:50.950
give you extra money
in your account

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:53.083
if you invest your
money in Enron.

00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:55.250
So most people at Enron had
their retirement savings

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.600
invested in Enron.

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.750
When the whole thing-- and Enron
was a very successful company,

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:01.592
in the Fortune 500,
doing quite well.

00:18:01.592 --> 00:18:03.800
When the whole thing collapsed,
these people not only

00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:07.470
lost their jobs, they
lost their entire savings.

00:18:07.470 --> 00:18:09.900
That's the problem with
non-diversification.

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.733
And the ultimate form
of non-diversification

00:18:11.733 --> 00:18:14.640
is to invest in the
company you're working for.

00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:16.708
Have I scared you enough?

00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:17.750
Any questions about that?

00:18:20.348 --> 00:18:21.140
Now, let's move on.

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:22.970
That finishes our
discussion of savings.

00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:25.250
Let's move on to a
totally new topic, which

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:27.990
we'll talk about this lecture
and the rest of next lecture,

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:29.810
which is international trade.

00:18:29.810 --> 00:18:32.720
And let's start with what
is international trade

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.928
and why the ruckus?

00:18:34.928 --> 00:18:36.470
This is the great
time to be teaching

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:38.220
on international trade,
probably the best,

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.943
most exciting time of any year
I've ever taught this topic.

00:18:40.943 --> 00:18:42.860
It's front and center
in a way it hasn't been,

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:45.990
probably, in decades.

00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:49.220
So what's the big deal?

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.270
Let's talk about
a simple example.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:53.817
How many people have
ever given someone roses

00:18:53.817 --> 00:18:54.650
for Valentine's Day?

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.310
Raise your hands.

00:18:59.310 --> 00:19:05.800
MIT, man-- that's OK, when I
was your age, I hadn't either.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:08.260
Now, here's the interesting
problem with Valentine's Day--

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:11.090
Valentine's Day
falls in the winter.

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:14.540
Roses don't grow outside
in the cold in the winter.

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.500
So what do you do?

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.660
For many years,
what we did was we

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.390
had hot houses where we grew--

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:23.810
basically were dedicated,
their reason for existing,

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:26.600
was essentially to grow
Valentine's Day roses.

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:29.210
So it's an industry around
growing these indoor roses

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:33.270
in the winter so that you
could have them available.

00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:35.250
But what happened over
time is we realized

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:38.730
it was a lot cheaper to actually
by the roses in Colombia

00:19:38.730 --> 00:19:41.060
or countries like
that, and fly them up,

00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:43.690
than to actually
have them grown here.

00:19:43.690 --> 00:19:45.960
So what happened
was all the roses

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.220
we get now in the winter
come from South America.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.640
And we don't grow roses in
America anymore in the winter.

00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.700
So is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:59.220
Well, on the one hand, roses
are a ton cheaper now than

00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.087
when I was a kid.

00:20:02.087 --> 00:20:04.170
So that's a good thing for
the romantics among us.

00:20:04.170 --> 00:20:06.475
You can get a dozen
roses for 25 bucks.

00:20:06.475 --> 00:20:08.600
It was like 80 bucks when
I was a kid or something.

00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.140
It was crazy.

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.640
On the other hand,
a bunch of guys

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.040
who used to grow these
roses are out of jobs.

00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:18.370
There was an industry devoted
to growing these roses

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:20.500
and these people
now have no job,

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.190
because they're
grown somewhere else.

00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:24.770
So how do we think about--

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:28.100
this trade-off is sort of a
microcosm of the larger debate

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.290
around international trade.

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:32.930
The larger debate about
whether trade is good or bad

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.610
comes down to this rose example.

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:38.810
It sort of summarizes
that issue.

00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:40.810
So now, when we think
about international trade,

00:20:40.810 --> 00:20:42.640
we think about three concepts.

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.730
We think about
exports, which are

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:53.430
the amount of goods that
we sell to other countries,

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:58.260
and imports, which are the
amount of goods that we

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.480
buy from other countries.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.360
So a country exports
to other countries.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.330
It imports from other countries.

00:21:05.330 --> 00:21:12.280
Currently, the US exports about
$1.6 trillion of goods a year.

00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:18.320
That's trillion with a T. It
imports about $2.4 trillion

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:27.800
of goods a year, leaving us with
an $800 billion trade deficit.

00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.930
You may have heard the President
mention this once or twice--

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:36.080
an $800 billion trade deficit.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:41.070
So the question you want to ask
is, how big a problem is this

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:42.450
that we have a trade deficit?

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:46.290
And the answer economists
give is none problem.

00:21:46.290 --> 00:21:46.790
No?

00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:47.960
No Spinal Tap fans here?

00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.020
OK, whatever.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:56.040
So basically, let's explain
this in a simple example.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:00.020
Imagine that you
have two Pikachus

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:04.020
and your friend has
two Jigglypuffs.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.130
And you want to have a more
diverse set of Pokemon,

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.620
so you go to your
friend and you say,

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.970
I will trade you one
Pikachu for one Jigglypuff.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:17.040
So you send your
friend a Pikachu.

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.120
He sends you a Jigglypuff.

00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.190
You've just created a
massive Pikachu deficit.

00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:25.650
Think about it-- you used
to have two Pikachus.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:27.210
You sent one away.

00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:28.530
You sent one away.

00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:31.170
You didn't get any
Pikachus back, did you?

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:35.230
So you've created a huge
deficit of one Pikachu.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:36.760
Is that bad?

00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.788
No, you got a Jigglypuff.

00:22:38.788 --> 00:22:39.330
You're happy.

00:22:39.330 --> 00:22:40.538
You wanted to make the trade.

00:22:40.538 --> 00:22:42.310
You made the trade.

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.268
Calling the trade deficit,
define trade deficit

00:22:44.268 --> 00:22:46.018
in terms of-- if you
define trade deficit,

00:22:46.018 --> 00:22:47.470
instead, in terms
of Jigglypuffs,

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.705
you've got a huge trade surplus.

00:22:49.705 --> 00:22:53.220
You used to get no
Jigglypuffs, now you get one.

00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:55.710
So basically, a trade
deficit, trade surplus,

00:22:55.710 --> 00:22:57.480
is all about an
arbitrary definition.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:01.170
The bottom line is America
then spends $800 billion more.

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:03.360
You're sending money
to other countries,

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.990
but we get $800 billion
year more stuff for it.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.730
There's no bad or good.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:11.790
It's just the way trade works.

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.825
So any time you've had a trade
in your life of anything,

00:23:14.825 --> 00:23:16.200
with a friend or
whatever, you've

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.360
created a deficit and a surplus.

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:21.880
But that doesn't mean anyone
is worse off or better off.

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.463
Whether you're worse
off or better off

00:23:23.463 --> 00:23:27.400
depends on the indicators of
the trade, depends on how much

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:31.360
each party values
what's going on.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:34.095
So basically, if I
said, oh, good Lord,

00:23:34.095 --> 00:23:37.090
if I had a headline like, "Good
Lord, Gruber Trades Pikachu

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:42.420
Deficit, Must End Trade
with Jigglypuff Land,"

00:23:42.420 --> 00:23:45.110
we must shut down trade,
because good Lord,

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:50.040
we're creating this huge Pikachu
deficit, that would be bad.

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.670
Because I wanted to trade
my Pikachu for a Jigglypuff

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:54.420
I was happier.

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:59.370
That would be a bad
thing to shut that off.

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:02.060
And that, in a stupid
example, is why economists

00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.810
like international trade.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.178
It's the same reason we
like trade in general.

00:24:07.178 --> 00:24:08.470
Think about this whole course--

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.660
the whole course is
a bit about trade.

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:13.690
It's about trading our
money for cookies and pizza,

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:17.800
about trading a firm's money
for workers and machines,

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.940
about trading my
time for a wage.

00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.403
Life is all about trades.

00:24:22.403 --> 00:24:24.570
International trade is just
another example of that.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.695
Just because it's got this
bizarre label of a trade

00:24:26.695 --> 00:24:29.930
deficit, we think
about it differently.

00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:34.190
So that's sort of basically,
if you think about-- now

00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:35.900
let's replace Pikachus
and Jigglypuffs

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.920
with the US and a poor country.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:41.170
Instead of US
having two Pikachus,

00:24:41.170 --> 00:24:43.420
the US has tons of money.

00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.940
Instead of the poor country
having two Jigglypuffs,

00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:49.720
the poor country has really
underpaid workers who

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.803
can make stuff really cheaply.

00:24:52.803 --> 00:24:53.970
So I, in the US, say, wait--

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.260
I have a lot of money.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.970
You've got a lot of sweaters.

00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:59.840
I'm going to send you my
money and get your sweaters.

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.640
I'm better off because
I was happy to buy

00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:02.878
those sweaters cheaply.

00:25:02.878 --> 00:25:04.920
You're better off because
you can't eat sweaters.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:07.400
You need money, so you
get some of my money.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:10.010
We're both better off, but
I've created a trade deficit.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.650
That is not
inherently a problem.

00:25:15.650 --> 00:25:19.500
Now of course, the reality
is more complicated.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.940
The reality is that when I send
the money to those countries

00:25:22.940 --> 00:25:25.190
to buy the sweaters, and
I bring the sweaters in,

00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.010
my consumers of sweaters
are much happier.

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:31.010
And I keep focusing on sweaters
because it's just amazing.

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:35.150
This sweater I just
got at Old Navy, $15.

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:38.110
Pretty nice, decent, it's
not cotton, whatever.

00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:38.900
$15.

00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:42.290
This would have been a
fortune when I was your age.

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.830
In those day's dollars,
it would've been $30,

00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:47.940
and that would be
like $70 today.

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:48.600
Why?

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.130
China.

00:25:51.130 --> 00:25:54.340
Because we used these to
make these in North Carolina,

00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:57.630
now we make them in China.

00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.930
So the good news is,
I went to Old Navy,

00:25:59.930 --> 00:26:04.700
I got two pairs of pants, and
like four sweaters, like $100.

00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:06.440
That's the good news.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.560
The bad news is the guys in
North Carolina lost their jobs.

00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.420
That's the bad news.

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.260
So there's a trade-off.

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.530
Now, I'm going to argue over
the next lecture and a half

00:26:16.530 --> 00:26:18.928
that that trade-off is
worth it in aggregate,

00:26:18.928 --> 00:26:20.970
but we can't ignore the
fact there's a trade-off.

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:24.570
Because that's what leads
to the very intense debates

00:26:24.570 --> 00:26:28.410
around international trade,
is the fundamental tension

00:26:28.410 --> 00:26:30.960
between the consumers
of goods that

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:33.090
are made cheaper by
international trade

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:34.980
and the producers
of goods that get

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.010
wiped out by
international trade.

00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:39.150
So that's our setup.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.230
That's our big picture.

00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:41.220
Now I'm going to
dive in, and I'm

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.970
going to teach you the
nitty gritty of how

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:45.510
we think about this with models,
but that's the big picture

00:26:45.510 --> 00:26:46.780
I wanted you to have in mind.

00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:48.030
So let's dive into the models.

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.640
And to do the models, I
need to introduce a new tool

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.910
to you, which is the
Production Possibility

00:26:53.910 --> 00:26:57.400
Frontier, the PPF, the
Production Possibility

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:57.900
Frontier.

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:08.020
What the PPF shows you is the
maximum combination of outputs

00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.540
you can produce for any
given set of inputs.

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:16.658
So basically, let's
think about that.

00:27:16.658 --> 00:27:18.200
Let's go to figure
18.2, because it's

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.820
easy to see this graphically.

00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.460
Let's go to figure 18.2.

00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:27.400
Let's think of you as a firm.

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:31.330
And you as a firm
produce two things--

00:27:31.330 --> 00:27:34.210
problem set points
and exam points.

00:27:34.210 --> 00:27:36.250
Sorry, it's all you're
good for at MIT here.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.920
You produce problem set
points and exam points,

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:40.540
but you can produce either.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.670
Those are the two
things you produce.

00:27:42.670 --> 00:27:46.300
And to make life easy, let's say
given your innate intelligence,

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.587
the points are produced
as a function of time.

00:27:48.587 --> 00:27:50.920
Literally the more time you
put in studying for an exam,

00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:53.503
the better you do, the more time
you spend on the problem set,

00:27:53.503 --> 00:27:54.660
the better you do.

00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:57.920
And you have one scarce
input, which is time.

00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.450
This production
possibility frontier

00:27:59.450 --> 00:28:01.340
tells you if you devote
your scarce input

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.980
across different activities,
what will the result be

00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.570
in terms of what's produced.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:07.730
So what's this line saying
on the left-hand side?

00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:13.040
It's saying, if I put all my
time into studying for exams,

00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.960
I'll get 200 points on
exams and 0 on problem sets.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:20.140
If I spend all my time
doing problem sets,

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.780
I'll got 200 points of
problem sets and 0 on exams,

00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.030
and some combinations
in between.

00:28:25.030 --> 00:28:28.600
That is a production
possibility frontier.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.650
It shows the
combination of output

00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:35.430
you get for any given
fixed level of inputs.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:38.870
Now, what is wrong with
the graph on the left?

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.410
And why is the graph on the
right a probably more realistic

00:28:42.410 --> 00:28:45.147
description of what your
actual production possibility

00:28:45.147 --> 00:28:45.980
frontier looks like?

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:51.169
Yeah.

00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:53.711
AUDIENCE: You know, if you can
get more points on the problem

00:28:53.711 --> 00:28:55.421
set, and you know more, you're
probably more well prepared

00:28:55.421 --> 00:28:56.220
for the exam.

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.137
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah.

00:28:57.137 --> 00:28:59.460
It's wrong because in
fact, what this system

00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:03.110
features is something we
call "economies of scope."

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:06.020
We talked about economies of
scale a number of lectures ago,

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.740
the notion that if you double
inputs, you double output.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.540
This is economies
of scope, which

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.090
is that by producing more
than one thing at once,

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:18.070
you may get better at both.

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:21.770
By studying for an exam, you
get better at problem sets.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.050
And by doing problem sets,
you do better on the exam.

00:29:25.050 --> 00:29:28.070
So what that means is,
doing some of both leads

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:33.360
to a better outcome than doing
all of one or all the other.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:38.510
You get a concave to
the origin production

00:29:38.510 --> 00:29:40.290
possibility frontier.

00:29:40.290 --> 00:29:41.780
A concave to the
origin production

00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.470
possibility frontier
demonstrates

00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:45.260
economies of scope.

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.913
Doing some of both
is better than

00:29:47.913 --> 00:29:49.580
doing all of just one
and all the other.

00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:50.955
And that makes
sense for you when

00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:52.280
doing problem sets and exams.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.670
It makes sense you'd be
better off doing some of both

00:29:54.670 --> 00:29:57.337
than devoting all your attention
to just one and just the other.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.890
So that is a production
possibility frontier.

00:30:01.890 --> 00:30:05.350
Now, there can also be
dis-economies of scope.

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.100
Another great example
for MIT is that when

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:09.630
I was here as an undergrad,
I came in as a tennis player.

00:30:09.630 --> 00:30:11.120
And I was on the tennis team.

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.912
Now tennis was only in
the fall and spring.

00:30:12.912 --> 00:30:14.240
In the winter, they had squash.

00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:16.260
So I thought I'd play squash.

00:30:16.260 --> 00:30:18.280
Well, it turns out that
the key with tennis

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.480
is keeping your wrist firm,
and the key with squash

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.370
is keeping your wrist flexible.

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:24.500
And by playing squash, I
screwed up my tennis game,

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.630
and by playing tennis, I
screwed up my squash game.

00:30:27.630 --> 00:30:30.090
So I had a dis-economy of scope.

00:30:30.090 --> 00:30:33.480
I was worse off at both things
by playing both, rather than

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.204
just playing one or the other.

00:30:36.204 --> 00:30:38.247
So there can be
economies of scope,

00:30:38.247 --> 00:30:40.580
which is when doing both
things make you better at both,

00:30:40.580 --> 00:30:43.010
and dis-economies of scope
when doing both things

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.200
make you worse at both.

00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:47.960
And that's the nature of
the shape of production

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.460
possibilities frontier.

00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:51.830
An economy of scope
is when doing both

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:52.880
makes you better off.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:59.270
A dis-economy of scope is when
doing both makes you worse off.

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:02.060
Questions about that?

00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.160
Now, I just introduced
that tool because that tool

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:08.700
is going to be the fundamental
modeling feature that

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.910
allows us to demonstrate
why international trade is

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.300
beneficial.

00:31:14.300 --> 00:31:16.580
So now, we're going
to take that tool

00:31:16.580 --> 00:31:19.760
and we're going to go and
talk about the concept

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:28.000
of comparative
advantage, which is

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.240
the core concept in
international trade economics.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.950
This is the core of
how it all works.

00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.400
Let's think of a particular
example to understand this.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:42.700
Let's take the US and
Colombia and the rose market.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:46.690
And as I said before, let's
say it's expensive for the US--

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:48.880
and the Valentine's
Day rose market.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.250
It's expensive for the US to
grow Valentine's Day roses.

00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:52.240
It's cheap in Colombia.

00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:59.930
On the other hand, let's
compare roses to computers.

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:01.858
Roses are cheap to
produce in Colombia

00:32:01.858 --> 00:32:02.900
and expensive in America.

00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:04.860
Computers are the opposite.

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.130
We have giant factories,
and skilled labor,

00:32:07.130 --> 00:32:10.040
and giant machines that can
quickly crank out computers.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:14.480
In Colombia, they'd have to like
assemble the computer by hand.

00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:17.630
So it's a lot cheaper to
produce a computer in the US

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.370
than it is in Colombia.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.740
It's a lot cheaper to
produce a rose in Colombia

00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:25.020
than it is in the US.

00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.750
The way to think about
this is through the lens

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:30.710
of opportunity cost.

00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:34.040
What we're saying is
the opportunity cost

00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:40.612
of making a rose in terms of
computers is higher in the US,

00:32:40.612 --> 00:32:43.070
In other words, the amount of
computers you have to give up

00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:45.800
to make a rose is high in the
US, because computers are cheap

00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:47.910
and roses are expensive.

00:32:47.910 --> 00:32:51.440
The amount of roses
you have to give up

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.080
to make a computer in
Colombia is higher,

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.790
because roses are cheap and
computers are expensive.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:33:10.590
So we say that Colombia has a
comparative advantage in roses.

00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:14.730
It is relatively cheap-- in a
world of computers and roses,

00:33:14.730 --> 00:33:17.280
it is relatively cheap
for them to produce roses

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:18.870
compared to computers.

00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:22.770
The opportunity costs in terms
of forgone computers is lower.

00:33:22.770 --> 00:33:27.960
Whereas the US has a comparative
advantage in computers.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:38.340
It is comparatively cheaper
for us to produce computers.

00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:41.460
So international trade
is all about what

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.913
you're relatively better at.

00:33:43.913 --> 00:33:45.830
Now, let me emphasize
"relative" for a second.

00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:47.510
This is an important concept.

00:33:47.510 --> 00:33:49.200
The reason we don't
just say "advantage"

00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.290
and we say "comparative
advantage" is it

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:53.590
doesn't actually matter
if you're better.

00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:55.315
It matters if you're
relatively better.

00:33:55.315 --> 00:33:55.940
Let me explain.

00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.260
This is hard.

00:33:57.260 --> 00:33:59.863
I would say of the main
economics concepts in the world

00:33:59.863 --> 00:34:01.280
that we need people
to understand,

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.560
this is one of the top three
least understood concepts

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.642
in all the world in economics.

00:34:05.642 --> 00:34:07.100
[INAUDIBLE] it's
like in our blood,

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.719
and we can't understand why
regular people can't understand

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:09.219
it.

00:34:09.219 --> 00:34:10.820
It's because it's hard.

00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:12.530
Let me give you an example.

00:34:12.530 --> 00:34:14.712
Take me and LeBron
James, and imagine

00:34:14.712 --> 00:34:16.670
there's two activities
in life, mowing the lawn

00:34:16.670 --> 00:34:17.900
and playing basketball.

00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:20.360
That's all life consists of.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.980
Now, LeBron James is better than
me at both playing basketball

00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:27.219
and mowing the lawn.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:29.030
But he's much, much,
much, much, much,

00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:31.420
much better than me at
basketball and only much

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.010
better than me at
mowing the lawn.

00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:38.900
So LeBron James has an advantage
in everything, both activities,

00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:43.656
but he only has a comparative
advantage in basketball.

00:34:43.656 --> 00:34:45.739
He only has a comparative
advantage in basketball.

00:34:45.739 --> 00:34:48.560
The comparative advantage
is about opportunity costs.

00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:52.699
In other words, if LeBron
James mows his lawn,

00:34:52.699 --> 00:34:55.760
the amount of basketball
he's giving up is ungodly.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.425
It's crazy to have
to mow his lawn,

00:34:57.425 --> 00:34:59.300
given how much basketball
he could've played.

00:34:59.300 --> 00:35:01.467
If I mow my lawn, I'm not
giving up much basketball,

00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:03.400
because I suck at basketball.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.872
So I have a comparative
advantage in lawn mowing.

00:35:05.872 --> 00:35:08.080
You say, you're not at lawn
mowing than LeBron James.

00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.100
I'm not.

00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:11.650
But I have a comparative
advantage in lawn mowing,

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:15.268
because the opportunity
cost to me is much lower.

00:35:15.268 --> 00:35:17.560
The opportunity cost to LeBron
James of mowing his lawn

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.750
is high, because he could
be playing basketball.

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.190
The opportunity
cost to me is low,

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:23.320
because I can't play basketball.

00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:24.313
Yeah.

00:35:24.313 --> 00:35:25.730
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
the only one

00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:28.000
in the world that can mow lawns.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.750
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a weird edge case.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:30.417
I won't do that.

00:35:30.417 --> 00:35:32.380
Then there'd be no reason for--

00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:34.630
that makes trade things hard.

00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:36.100
We can come back to that.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:39.910
Now of course, the example
doesn't stop there.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:43.360
Should I mow my lawn?

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:47.290
No, I should not mow
my lawn, because there

00:35:47.290 --> 00:35:52.720
is someone who doesn't have
as much education as I, who

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.502
can't earn as much
money than I at work.

00:35:55.502 --> 00:35:57.710
And they have a comparative
advantage in lawn mowing.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:00.482
I have a comparative
advantage in office work.

00:36:00.482 --> 00:36:01.940
So in fact, not
only should I mow--

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.710
do I have comparative advantage
over LeBron in lawn mowing,

00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:07.290
but some less-educated guy
has a competitive edge over me

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.608
in lawn mowing.

00:36:09.608 --> 00:36:11.150
So just as LeBron
would be better off

00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:13.233
letting me mow his lawn
and I'm better off letting

00:36:13.233 --> 00:36:15.040
him play basketball,
I'm better off

00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:18.170
letting some less-educated guy
mow my lawn, and letting me go

00:36:18.170 --> 00:36:21.625
sit in front of my
computer all day.

00:36:21.625 --> 00:36:23.250
Comparative advantage
is all about what

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.210
you're relatively better at.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:30.740
And the key insight
of international trade

00:36:30.740 --> 00:36:34.940
is that in a world of
comparative advantage,

00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:38.770
people should always specialize.

00:36:38.770 --> 00:36:40.960
In a world of
comparative advantage,

00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.083
people should always specialize.

00:36:43.083 --> 00:36:44.500
You should do what
you're best at.

00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:50.290
You should do what you're best
at because otherwise, it's

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:54.002
simply silly for LeBron to
spend any time mowing his lawn.

00:36:54.002 --> 00:36:56.460
As much as my wife thinks I'm
just trying to get out of it,

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:59.230
it's simply silly for me to
spend any time mowing my lawn.

00:37:01.910 --> 00:37:04.630
I have a comparative advantage
sitting on my computer

00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:06.520
and doing that stuff,
so I should hire

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.470
someone else to mow my lawn.

00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:15.367
So to actually see that,
let's go to figure 18.3.

00:37:15.367 --> 00:37:16.784
This is a confusing
figure, so I'm

00:37:16.784 --> 00:37:20.450
going to go through it slowly.

00:37:20.450 --> 00:37:24.260
On the top, we have the US
production possibilities

00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:24.980
frontier.

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:27.020
And to make life
easy, let's assume

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.300
that there's no
economies of scope

00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:30.850
between roses and computers.

00:37:30.850 --> 00:37:32.187
Makes sense there wouldn't be.

00:37:32.187 --> 00:37:34.270
Let's assume there's no
economies or dis-economies

00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:35.437
between roses and computers.

00:37:35.437 --> 00:37:37.523
It's a linear production
possibility frontier.

00:37:37.523 --> 00:37:40.190
So we're showing each graph as a
production possibility frontier

00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:41.630
between roses and computers.

00:37:41.630 --> 00:37:44.990
And we're assuming it's just
linear, which makes sense.

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:48.440
You don't make better computers
by making roses and vice versa.

00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.420
On the top, we have the US.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.710
Let's say that the US's
production possibility

00:37:53.710 --> 00:37:54.890
frontier is the following--

00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:57.680
given the resources
we have in the US,

00:37:57.680 --> 00:38:03.608
we can produce 2,000 computers
or 1,000 boxes of roses, given

00:38:03.608 --> 00:38:05.400
our resources, our
skill level, our capital

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.090
intensity, et cetera.

00:38:08.090 --> 00:38:10.230
Now go to Colombia.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:14.040
Say that Colombia, given
their skill level, resources,

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:16.570
the sunshine, the
beautiful weather--

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.630
any Colombians here?

00:38:18.630 --> 00:38:19.290
Sounds perfect.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.470
It's like 75 all the time.

00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.240
They can make 2,000 roses
and 1,000 computers,

00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:30.590
or 1,000 computers, or some
combination in between.

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.875
So the first thing I want
to make you guys understand

00:38:32.875 --> 00:38:35.000
is why these are sensible
production possibility

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.278
frontiers for each country.

00:38:36.278 --> 00:38:38.320
They're sensible production
possibility frontiers

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:43.810
because they basically show the
US has a comparative advantage

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:45.760
in computers.

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.950
That is, the trade-off
in terms of roses

00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:53.650
foregone to make a computer is
lower in the US than Colombia.

00:38:53.650 --> 00:38:59.830
And Colombia has a comparative
advantage in roses.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.200
The trade-off in terms
of foregone computers

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:06.520
to make a rose is much lower
in Colombia than in the US.

00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.680
So comparative advantage
is about opportunity cost.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.830
Let me say it again--

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:11.350
the US has a
comparative advantage

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:14.080
in computers because
to make a computer,

00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.510
we have to give up less
roses than Colombia does.

00:39:16.510 --> 00:39:20.410
To make one computer, we
give up half a box of roses.

00:39:20.410 --> 00:39:22.417
That's the slope of this line.

00:39:22.417 --> 00:39:23.875
Colombia, to make
one computer, has

00:39:23.875 --> 00:39:26.790
to give up two boxes of roses.

00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:29.802
So we have a comparative
advantage in computers.

00:39:29.802 --> 00:39:30.649
Yeah.

00:39:30.649 --> 00:39:32.232
AUDIENCE: Would it
be possible to have

00:39:32.232 --> 00:39:34.128
comparative advantage in both?

00:39:34.128 --> 00:39:35.295
JONATHAN GRUBER: You cannot.

00:39:35.295 --> 00:39:36.510
That's the term "comparative."

00:39:36.510 --> 00:39:39.000
You can have an absolute-- in
this simple two by two model.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:39.610
You can have
comparative advantage

00:39:39.610 --> 00:39:40.800
in multiple things in life.

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.690
From the simple model, you can
have the absolute advantage

00:39:42.690 --> 00:39:44.310
of both, but you can't have a
comparative advantage in both.

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:45.390
That's absolutely right.

00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:47.563
In this model, with two
goods and two countries,

00:39:47.563 --> 00:39:49.230
each country has a
comparative advantage

00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:50.862
in one thing or the other.

00:39:50.862 --> 00:39:52.320
Or there could be
weird edge cases,

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.870
but generally that's right.

00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:56.110
So now, I did computers.

00:39:56.110 --> 00:39:58.020
Now let's flip and do roses.

00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.260
In roses, for the US to
produce a box of roses,

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:04.360
they have to give
up two computers.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.310
For Colombia to
produce a box of roses,

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:08.140
they only give up
half a computer,

00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.360
so they have a comparative
advantage in roses.

00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:15.720
People understand the setup
here, these graphs on the left?

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:16.812
Yeah.

00:40:16.812 --> 00:40:18.420
AUDIENCE: Does the
price of what you

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:22.530
can sell each unit for factor
into what you actually produce?

00:40:22.530 --> 00:40:25.470
Because I can imagine
that yes, maybe you

00:40:25.470 --> 00:40:26.853
can produce more roses--

00:40:26.853 --> 00:40:28.520
JONATHAN GRUBER: But
they're worth less.

00:40:28.520 --> 00:40:29.820
AUDIENCE: --more
easily, but they-- you

00:40:29.820 --> 00:40:32.010
can't sell a rose as much
as you can [INAUDIBLE]

00:40:32.010 --> 00:40:32.220
JONATHAN GRUBER: Right.

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.320
So for right now,
we're ignoring prices.

00:40:34.320 --> 00:40:36.000
We'll come back to prices
later, but for right now,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.083
we're ignoring the prices.

00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:38.700
Right now, we're just sort of--

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:42.300
we're going to basically
have prices come in later,

00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:44.670
but for right now,
we're doing prices.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:48.300
So now, let's
imagine that tastes

00:40:48.300 --> 00:40:52.450
are such that
consumers in the US

00:40:52.450 --> 00:40:55.510
want 1,000 computers
and 500 boxes of roses.

00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:57.670
That's point C US.

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.820
And consumers in Colombia
want 500 computers

00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.020
and 1,000 box of roses.

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.250
I just made this up.

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:06.265
C US and C CO, I
just made up tastes.

00:41:06.265 --> 00:41:08.890
I just said, let's just make it
a case where people in Colombia

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:11.650
like roses better, people in
America like computers better.

00:41:11.650 --> 00:41:14.740
And imagine we do not
allow international trade.

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.675
This is the best case.

00:41:15.675 --> 00:41:18.050
Actually, international trade
would be even more valuable

00:41:18.050 --> 00:41:19.217
with a different assumption.

00:41:19.217 --> 00:41:21.970
I've made assumptions which
make trade less valuable than it

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.200
would otherwise be.

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.660
I said look, Colombia produces
roses and people there

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.990
like roses.

00:41:26.990 --> 00:41:29.650
American produce computers and
people there like computers,

00:41:29.650 --> 00:41:30.790
but not totally.

00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:32.260
Some US guy still
wants some roses.

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.650
Some Colombian guy still
wants some computers.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:37.470
Now imagine we
don't allow trade.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:38.880
What's the outcome?

00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:42.900
Well, in the US,
we will produce--

00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:46.800
like I said, we want 1,000
computers and 500 roses,

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:49.940
so we'll produce 1,000
computers and we'll

00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.130
consume 1,000 computers.

00:41:52.130 --> 00:41:53.630
So on the chart on
the right, you've

00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:55.550
got production and consumption.

00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:57.460
For the US, we'll
produce 1,000 computers,

00:41:57.460 --> 00:41:58.460
consume 1,000 computers.

00:41:58.460 --> 00:41:59.918
We have to consume
what we produce.

00:41:59.918 --> 00:42:01.500
There is no trade.

00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.720
And same with roses-- we'll
produce 500, consume 500.

00:42:03.720 --> 00:42:04.985
Colombia's the flip.

00:42:04.985 --> 00:42:08.580
So you end up in the world with
1,500 computers being produced

00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.343
and consumed, and 1,500 roses
being produced and consumed.

00:42:11.343 --> 00:42:14.010
Now, you might say that's silly,
computers cost more than roses.

00:42:14.010 --> 00:42:15.093
We'll come back to prices.

00:42:15.093 --> 00:42:19.100
For now, we're leaving
prices out of it.

00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.710
The point is, given
the tastes I've

00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:24.620
suggested with C US and C CO--

00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:26.320
I just made those up--

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.120
given those tastes, we'll
end up in a situation where

00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.100
every country just
consumes what they produce,

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.183
because there's no trade,
and the world as a whole

00:42:33.183 --> 00:42:39.080
will produce 1,500 boxes
of roses, 1,500 computers.

00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:44.620
Now let's say that
we allow trade.

00:42:44.620 --> 00:42:49.970
What trade does is introduce
economies of scope.

00:42:49.970 --> 00:42:50.920
Why?

00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:55.110
Because trade allows
specialization.

00:42:55.110 --> 00:42:57.890
Flip to the next figure.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:01.130
The next figure is the
figure for the world.

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:05.590
Imagine the world
only wanted computers.

00:43:05.590 --> 00:43:08.005
That's the point on the y-axis.

00:43:08.005 --> 00:43:09.880
Then the US would produce
2,000, and Colombia

00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.713
would produce 1,000.

00:43:10.713 --> 00:43:12.650
We'd have 3,000.

00:43:12.650 --> 00:43:15.140
Imagine the world only
wanted roses, the flip side.

00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:17.300
We have 3,000.

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:21.230
But if the world wants
both, you get more.

00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.130
Why?

00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:25.790
Why is it outward bending
when you allow trade?

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.430
This is not a technological
change, change in technology.

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:31.220
All we've done is
take these two PPS

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:32.780
and combine them
and allow trade.

00:43:32.780 --> 00:43:34.947
Why does that suddenly
introduce economies of scope?

00:43:37.502 --> 00:43:38.960
Because what do
countries get to do

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.310
compared to what they
were doing before when

00:43:40.310 --> 00:43:41.143
they couldn't trade?

00:43:41.143 --> 00:43:42.920
What do they get to do now?

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:43.820
AUDIENCE: Specialize.

00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:47.120
JONATHAN GRUBER: Specialize
the US specializes in--

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:49.790
and Colombia
specializes in roses.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:52.820
By specializing,
we can make more,

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:55.140
because that's
what we're good at.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:59.700
So by trading, we
allow specialization.

00:43:59.700 --> 00:44:01.320
Without trading, we
can't specialize,

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:02.570
because some guys in
the US want roses.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:03.510
We've got to make some roses.

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:04.440
But that's stupid.

00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.750
We shouldn't make roses.

00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:08.130
We should let
Colombia make roses.

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.500
If LeBron can't hire
anyone to mow his lawn,

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:11.790
he's going to mow his lawn.

00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.050
That's stupid.

00:44:13.050 --> 00:44:15.175
LeBron should hire someone
to mow his lawn and play

00:44:15.175 --> 00:44:16.730
basketball all the time.

00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:21.500
By allowing trade, we allow
people to specialize and take

00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.680
advantage of their
comparative advantages.

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.878
Without trade, you
can't take advantage

00:44:26.878 --> 00:44:27.920
of comparative advantage.

00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.510
Without trade, it
doesn't matter if the US

00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:31.260
is better at producing
computers or roses.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.960
What's produced is just
determined by people's tastes.

00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:38.110
But with trade,
you can specialize.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:43.550
And that yields the outcome
we discussed in figure 18.5.

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:48.800
Figure 18.5 takes the previous
figure, 18.3, and adds trade.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:50.030
So let me go through this.

00:44:50.030 --> 00:44:51.800
The basic, the
blue, the PPFs are

00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:55.080
the same on the left,
same PPFs as before.

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:59.720
And if you look at point CO
and C US [INAUDIBLE] before,

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.650
we could have 1,000 computers
and 500 roses in the US

00:45:03.650 --> 00:45:06.800
or 1,000 roses and 500
computers in Colombia.

00:45:06.800 --> 00:45:09.680
But now suppose we allow trade.

00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.530
What happens now?

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:12.920
Well, what happens
now is the US goes

00:45:12.920 --> 00:45:17.150
to producing only
computers and Colombia

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:21.700
goes to producing only roses.

00:45:21.700 --> 00:45:24.080
Now let's assume, just
to make life easy,

00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.467
let's just assume that people's
tastes are proportional.

00:45:26.467 --> 00:45:28.300
So if there's more
computers and more roses,

00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:30.133
they just want
proportionately more of each.

00:45:30.133 --> 00:45:32.810
So the US, as
there's more of both,

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:35.980
wants two computers
for every rose.

00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.990
And Colombia wants two
roses for every computer.

00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:40.010
That's just their tastes.

00:45:40.010 --> 00:45:43.700
What happens now is we shift
out to these new levels, C prime

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:47.320
US and C prime Colombia.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.460
At the new levels, the US
produces 2,000 computers.

00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:53.850
All they do is computers.

00:45:53.850 --> 00:45:57.240
Colombia produces 2,000 roses.

00:45:57.240 --> 00:46:01.270
The world as a whole
ends up with more.

00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:04.150
Flip back two pages and look
at the table on the right.

00:46:04.150 --> 00:46:06.430
The world as a whole
ended up with 1,500 roses

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:08.610
and 1,500 computers.

00:46:08.610 --> 00:46:12.550
Now the world as a whole
ends up with 2,000 roses

00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:15.720
and 2,000 computers.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:16.800
What happened?

00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:20.730
Nothing changed technologically,
same PPS here as before.

00:46:20.730 --> 00:46:23.550
All the change is by trading.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.580
We allowed people to exploit
their comparative advantage

00:46:26.580 --> 00:46:28.440
through specialization.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:32.130
Without trading, the US was
inefficiently producing roses

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.500
and Colombia was inefficiently
producing computers.

00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:38.558
With trading, we've now
opened up the possibility

00:46:38.558 --> 00:46:40.600
that they can specialize
in what they're good at.

00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.433
And the world as a whole
ends up better off.

00:46:45.230 --> 00:46:47.090
And look at both countries.

00:46:47.090 --> 00:46:50.570
Both countries end up
with more consumption.

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:55.360
The US gets more computers,
so flip back and forth

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:57.030
between 18.3 and 18.5.

00:46:57.030 --> 00:47:00.330
The US goes from 500
roses and 1,000 computers

00:47:00.330 --> 00:47:03.450
to 750 roses and
1,250 computers.

00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:08.940
Colombia goes from 1,000
roses and 500 computers

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.610
to 1,250 roses
and 750 computers.

00:47:11.610 --> 00:47:13.380
Now, the split between
roses and computers

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:15.127
here is not determinate.

00:47:15.127 --> 00:47:15.960
That's just made up.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:17.710
I made up what tastes look like.

00:47:17.710 --> 00:47:22.020
The point C and C prime,
that's just made up.

00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.520
What you care about
is the bottom panel.

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.670
What you care about is fact
that the world as a whole

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:31.620
now has more roses and
more computers in it.

00:47:31.620 --> 00:47:35.190
And that is the mechanics of
why international trade expands

00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:38.140
our production
possibility frontier.

00:47:38.140 --> 00:47:41.140
We have more goods
in the world once we

00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:43.233
can trade, not because--

00:47:43.233 --> 00:47:45.400
I mean, you still have the
same, where Pikachu and--

00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:47.442
when I allow trade between
you and your friend,

00:47:47.442 --> 00:47:48.900
that doesn't create
any more goods.

00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.580
You each have two cards.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.620
But in the real world,
it creates trade,

00:47:52.620 --> 00:47:55.670
because the production
allows people to specialize.

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:57.280
And that's the beauty of trade.

00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:00.750
We'll come back next time
and do a welfare analysis,

00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:04.100
talking about why international
trade makes people better off.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.870
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:26.570
lecture on nonlinear finite
element analysis of solids and

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.010
structures.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.840
In this lecture, I would like
to continue to consider the

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.650
plate with a hole that we
already considered in the

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.830
previous lecture.

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.550
But I now would like to
turn our attention

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.910
to a nonlinear solution.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.920
As we mentioned in previous
lectures, a nonlinear analysis

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.500
should only be performed only
once a linear solution has

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.790
been obtained.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.680
The linear solution checks the
finite element model and

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.260
yields valuable insight
into what

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.390
nonlinearities are important.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.630
And once again, we considered
the linear solution of this

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.585
plate in the previous lecture.

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:03.110
We now want to go on with
the nonlinear solution.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.280
Here we have the plate with
the hole once again.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.630
It's a square plate subjected
to the loading shown.

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.940
Here is the whole.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.730
These were the material
data that we used

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.240
in the linear analysis.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.960
The thickness of the plate
is given here.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.170
We consider only one quarter
of the plate because of

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.240
symmetry conditions, we can
considering that one quarter,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.220
analyze the whole plate,
as we have discussed in

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.090
the previous lecture.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.610
In the previous lecture, we
also showed how we use

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.540
ADINA-IN to generate the
data for this mesh.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.640
And this input data then is
used in ADINA to actually

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.040
perform the analysis.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.560
We did the analysis for
linear conditions in

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.300
the previous lecture.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.660
Some important considerations
for the nonlinear analysis are

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.000
now what material model to
select, what displacement

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.780
strain assumptions to make,
what sequence of load

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.890
application to choose, and
what nonlinear equation

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.070
solution strategy and

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.220
convergence criteria to select.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.090
We will address these issues
in this lecture.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.770
We use, once again,
the ADINA system.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:24.740
Now, of course, for the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:27.990
elasto-plastic static response.

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.880
We will also investigate the
effect on the response when a

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.410
shaft is placed into
the plate hole.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.440
Some important observations
regarding the nonlinear

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.190
analysis are given on
this viewgraph.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.630
First of all, we notice that
the recommendations that we

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.820
discussed regarding the linear
analysis that we discussed in

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.030
the previous lecture are also
very valid here of course.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.140
But for the nonlinear analysis,
we need also to

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.600
consider and be careful with the
sequence and incremental

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.510
magnitudes of load application
and the choice of convergence

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.030
tolerances.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.780
We ill address, of course,
these issues just now.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.720
The first analysis that I'd like
to discuss with you is a

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.740
limit load calculation
of the plate.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.130
Here we show the plate and the
load, p, will increase

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:32.830
continuously up to a maximum
value and then decrease to 0.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.270
The plate is modelled as an
elasto-plastic material.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.830
And the material assumption
is summarized on

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.540
this viewgraph here.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.150
Here are the material
properties.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.590
We assume basically
it is a steel.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.310
Notice the stress strain
law is shown here.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:55.330
We assume isotropic hardening
in the analysis.

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.690
We discussed what this means
in an earlier lecture.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.400
The initial Young's modulus is
the one that we use for the

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.940
linear analysis.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.070
Nu is equal to 0.3.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.350
And the strain hardening
modulus is given here.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.839
This idealization is probably
only applicable to small

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:20.870
strain conditions,
strains that are

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.940
smaller than 2% roughly.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.680
The maximum that you would want
to allow is probably 4%.

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.000
And we will actually perform
the analysis first using a

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.550
materially nonlinear
only formulation.

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.990
This means, as we discussed in
the early lectures, that we

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.080
neglect all kinematic
nonlinearities, that we only

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.240
include the material
nonlinearities in the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.180
analysis, these material
nonlinearities.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.050
Later on, we however want to
also perform in this lecture

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.200
an analysis that includes the
displacement large quotations

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.620
and in fact even large
strain conditions.

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.530
And we will study those analysis
results in comparison

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.650
to the material nonlinear
only analysis results.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.090
The load history used
for the analysis is

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.050
shown on this viewgraph.

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:16.660
You can see that we are
increasingly linearly the load

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.880
up to a maximum value of 650
MPa, megapascals, and then

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.380
suddenly decrease
the load to 0.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:31.100
Notice we are using altogether
14 steps, 13 to increase the

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.000
load and just one step
to decrease the load.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.060
Of course, we are having
here a time axis.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.930
But the load step or time
step that we used was

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.100
delta t equal to 1.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.070
Well we performed this analysis
a few weeks ago in my

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:50.150
laboratory at MIT.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:55.220
And we brought in a video crew
to video record our actions.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.690
I'd like to now share with you
what we have recorded and also

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.820
narrate to you what actually is
happening in the computer

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.510
run as we prepare the computer
run, as we run it, and also

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.790
interprets the resides.

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:16.680
Our first step is to modify
the input data that we

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.210
prepared in the previous
lecture for the linear

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:20.540
analysis of the plate.

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.910
We now have to, of course,
modify this input data.

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.130
First of all, to introduce the
load curve, this load history

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:32.880
curve that we just discussed.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.490
And then we also have to modify
the material data to

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.260
correspond to the elasto-plastic
material data

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:43.740
that we now want to associate
with a plate.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.240
So let us look now at the video
record of what we did

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.430
some weeks ago in my laboratory
at MIT regarding

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:57.750
the change of these
input data.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:06:59.820
Here we see once more the
mesh that we're using

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.760
to analyze the plate.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.950
And now we prepare input
data for ADINA-IN.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.250
Here we input the time function
that we employ.

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:16.200
You recognize the function
points for time 0, 13, and 14

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:32.100
with the values 0, 6.5, 0.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.430
We also input that 14 steps are
used in the analysis, that

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.340
time step delta t is 1.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:40.630
Next we input the material
definition.

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:43.700
And note that there is a
typographical error.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:48.100
We typed plestic instead
of plastic.

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.880
We try to do the typing fast and
did not notice the error.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:54.790
Notice the Young's module E,
Poisson's ratio nu, the strain

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.950
hardening modulus ET, and the
yield stress [? sigma ?]

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:59.200
yield are defined.

00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:04.220
Because of the typographical
error, the program prints out

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:07.300
an error message, namely the
plestic material is not found

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.430
in the library.

00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.410
Here we see the library
of material models

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:12.680
available in ADINA.

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:16.830
The library consists of the
material models elastic,

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:22.830
orthotropic, thermo-elastic,
and so on and so on.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:24.780
We know retype the material
data definition.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.660
We also do not want to use
equilibrium iterations.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.060
The default in ADINA is to use
equilibrium iterations.

00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:57.680
Actually, the BFGS method we
discussed earlier because

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.860
large errors of solution
can accumulate when

00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:01.860
iterations are not used.

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.930
We discussed all of
this earlier.

00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.710
Let's see what happens when we
do not iterate in the solution

00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.450
of this problem, just
as a point of study.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.150
We now finally by the command
ADINA generate

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:14.190
the ADINA data input.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.880
Note that in this input
preparation we only change the

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.500
data from the linear analysis
data used in the previous

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:22.200
lecture to the data for the
nonlinear analysis we want to

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:23.450
perform now.

00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:30.420
Having set up the proper input
data for ADINA-IN and having

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:34.490
used ADINA-IN to generate the
input data for ADINA, we can

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:38.440
now execute that input data with
ADINA obtain our first

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.580
analysis results.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:45.490
We evaluate these analysis
results by plotting the force

00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:49.850
applied here as a function
of the displacements

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.360
corresponding to this
motion as well.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.470
And we will see that the force
displacement curve looks

00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:59.850
rather unphysical.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:02.020
In other words, the
results don't make

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:04.420
much physical sense.

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.780
So we search for
an explanation.

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.750
Why is that so?

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.720
And we will find that the reason
is that we did not use

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:15.300
equilibrium iterations
in the analysis.

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:20.120
In fact, if you go back, you
will see that we deliberately

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.750
did not want to use equilibrium
iterations in this

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:27.280
first analysis, although in
ADINA the default is to use

00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:29.660
equipment directions.

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:34.720
But I wanted to once show you
what kind of results you must

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.780
expect if you don't use
equilibrium iterations.

00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:40.020
So we realized that we should
really use equilibrium

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:42.800
iterations and that we will, of
course, have to change our

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.840
input a little bit through
ADINA-IN in order to perform

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.520
equilibrium iterations.

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:54.230
The load history that we will
still be using is the same.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:55.790
Here it is shown once again.

00:10:55.790 --> 00:11:00.020
But now we will use the default
method of equilibrium

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:03.570
iterations, the BFGS method.

00:11:03.570 --> 00:11:06.540
And this one will be applied,
this method of equilibrium

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.690
iteration will be used
for each load step.

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:13.730
Once again, 13 load steps up
and one load step down.

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:17.490
The convergence criteria that
we using in the analysis are

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.150
show here, the convergence
criteria on energy.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.920
And we talked about this one
quite extensively in a

00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:25.010
previous lecture.

00:11:25.010 --> 00:11:28.830
And the convergence criteria on
the force, again, I'd like

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:32.120
to refer you to our
previous lecture.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:35.860
When we apply equilibrium
iterations in each step, we

00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:38.820
will see that our results
look good.

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.520
They make physical sense.

00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.420
In fact, they look
quite appealing.

00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.460
So let us look now at these
solution results.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:49.780
Let us go, in other words, to
what has happened in the

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.120
laboratory the way we
have been video

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:55.270
recording it earlier.

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:58.310
Here we see the solution
results, the load applied as a

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:00.620
function of the displacement,
the extension

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.220
of the quarter plate.

00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:05.270
On the horizontal axis, we
measure the displacement.

00:12:11.050 --> 00:12:13.790
On the vertical axis, we
measures of value of the load,

00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:15.080
actually the pressure applied.

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:23.440
So far the curve looks OK.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.340
But we show here only the
responsible for the first 13

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:30.280
steps for which the load has
increased monotonically.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.860
here we see now the
load displacement

00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:35.160
response for all 14 steps.

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:38.290
Notice that the scale on the
horizontal axis measuring

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.560
displacement is different from
what we used before.

00:12:45.530 --> 00:12:49.090
Note that the 13 first steps
bring us to the maximum load

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.090
and maximum positive
displacement and that the

00:12:52.090 --> 00:12:55.330
predicted unloading response
in step 14 is quite

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:56.580
unrealistic.

00:12:59.890 --> 00:13:02.770
We obtain a large negative
displacement.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:05.840
As we will see, this is due to
not having used equilibrium

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.200
iterations.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.120
Next, we look at the mesh and
study the plastic zones as

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.690
they develop with
increasing load.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.620
A time code is given
about the mesh.

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:20.482
This time code gives
the step number.

00:13:20.482 --> 00:13:24.870
It increases until time
is equal to 14.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.960
The plastic zones are
shown by shading the

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.940
area that is plastic.

00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:30.810
For the first steps, there's
no plasticity.

00:13:44.810 --> 00:13:47.370
Then the plastic zone is small,
it develops around the

00:13:47.370 --> 00:14:00.050
hole and it grows rapidly
as the larger

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:01.300
load levels are reached.

00:14:04.850 --> 00:14:08.305
Note also how the plastic zone
spreads through the elements.

00:14:08.305 --> 00:14:12.080
We used 3 by 3 Gauss numerical
integration and test whether

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.130
an integration point
has gone plastic.

00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:17.460
If so, we shade the contributory
area of the

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:18.960
integration point.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.120
As an average for each
integration point, the

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.470
contributory area is 1/9 ninth
of the element area.

00:14:25.470 --> 00:14:29.200
Here at step 12, you can very
nicely see how the plastic

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.052
zones have progressed through
the elements.

00:14:32.052 --> 00:14:34.270
The elastic plastic
interface boundary

00:14:34.270 --> 00:14:37.790
goes through the elements.

00:14:37.790 --> 00:14:40.960
Note that at step 14, after
unloading much off the plate

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.980
is still plastic.

00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:43.230
This is quite unphysical.

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.280
We now rerun the analysis with
equilibrium iterations and

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.130
here is the load displacement
response we now obtain.

00:14:53.130 --> 00:14:55.470
First we look at the
scales on the axes.

00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:17.900
We note that the loading
response is similar to what we

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.550
had before.

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.270
Although a much larger
displacement is

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.770
reached in steps 13.

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.280
The unloading response in step
14 is now quite realistic,

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.210
with a permanent positive
displacement at zero load.

00:15:31.210 --> 00:15:36.900
Finally, we show the plastic
zones for this analysis.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.880
Note that we show the initial
mesh time 0 and then

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.750
immediately the time
equals 6 results.

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:46.500
Initially, the plasticity
progresses as much as in the

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.400
analysis without equilibrium
iterations, but the final

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.720
spread of plasticity reached
in step 13 is larger.

00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:55.200
And after unloading of the
load at the end of the

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.150
analysis, the complete
plate is elastic.

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:02.110
However, clearly permanent
deformations have occurred as

00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:05.190
can be seen by looking at the
default mesh at time 14.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:12.000
As we discussed already, our
analysis results now look

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:12.690
quite good.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.780
They look quite reasonable.

00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:18.390
But one additional way to
evaluate the analysis results

00:16:18.390 --> 00:16:20.500
is to plot stress vectors.

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.230
We did so in the linear analysis
of the previous

00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:28.020
lecture when we also looked at
the analysis results obtained

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.530
from this mesh, but of course,
in linear analysis.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:35.010
We want to do now the same for
the nonlinear analysis results

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.430
that we obtained.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:40.750
And let us just quickly look
at what we're doing in the

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:42.990
stress vector output.

00:16:42.990 --> 00:16:50.450
We plot at each integration
point two lines as shown here.

00:16:50.450 --> 00:16:56.120
If they are carrying an arrow,
then it is tensile stress.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:59.760
No arrow means compressive
stress.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.410
And notice these two
lines correspond to

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:06.550
the principal stresses.

00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:11.460
Notice that the lengths of these
lines are proportional

00:17:11.460 --> 00:17:13.890
to the magnitudes
of the stresses.

00:17:13.890 --> 00:17:19.920
So let's now do a stress vector
plot for the mesh at

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:24.020
time 13 and at time 14, in other
words, at maximum load

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:28.170
application and after removal
of the total load, four the

00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:29.995
results that we just
have obtained.

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:35.590
Here we see the stress vectors
plotted onto the total mesh

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:40.150
for the stress state at time
13, that is at total load.

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.500
We note of course, that there
is very much information,

00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.750
there are many stress vectors.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:47.570
To see any detail we have to
focus our attention onto

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:48.820
certain elements.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.890
Here we now look closer at the
elements adjacent to the

00:17:53.890 --> 00:17:56.770
horizontal symmetry line.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.980
We note that the stress vectors
correspond to vertical

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.715
tensile stresses as expected.

00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:08.040
At a top edge of the plate we
see tensile vertical stresses

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.820
and tensile horizontal
stresses.

00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:13.660
The maximum stress at any
integration point is 1100

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:17.610
megapascals and occurs
near the hole.

00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:20.940
Here we now see the stress
vector plot at time 14, that

00:18:20.940 --> 00:18:24.300
is after load removal.

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.030
It is most interesting
to study the

00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.050
stress flow in the mesh.

00:18:28.050 --> 00:18:32.240
Note that the stresses flow
along and parallel to the free

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.690
surface of the plate.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:38.170
This must be so because there
are no externally applied

00:18:38.170 --> 00:18:40.100
tractions anymore.

00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:42.060
Here we see the detail of
the stress flow in the

00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:43.390
corner of the plate.

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:47.940
The stress vectors are parallel
to the free surface.

00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:51.080
And here is the stress flow in
the elements around the hole.

00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.660
The same observations apply.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:19:01.150
The maximum stress is
880.3 megapascals.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:03.705
This completes what I wanted to
show you in this phase of

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:06.620
the analysis.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.620
This completes our materially
nonlinear only

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:10.330
analysis of the plate.

00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.770
However, if we look at the
solution results once more

00:19:12.770 --> 00:19:17.770
closely, we find that in this
element here the magnitude of

00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:23.620
the strains is about 2% at the
end of load step 11, 4% at the

00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:28.060
end of load step 12, and
14% to 15% at the end

00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:29.340
of load step 13.

00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:32.240
In other words, at maximum
load application, we have

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.430
certainly here large strains.

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:38.270
And one might very well ask,
what is the effect of this

00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:40.760
large strain on the
analysis results?

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.330
Of course, in the materially
nonlinear only solution, we

00:19:43.330 --> 00:19:47.500
did not include any kinematic
nonlinearities.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:51.670
So our next objective is then to
perform analysis that said

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:54.350
include kinematic
nonlinearities.

00:19:54.350 --> 00:19:57.830
And we want to now proceed
with a total Lagrangian

00:19:57.830 --> 00:20:02.110
formulation analysis, which
includes large displacements,

00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:05.750
large rotations, but
only small strains.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:09.030
And I also want to share with
you some solution results that

00:20:09.030 --> 00:20:13.310
we obtained using an updated
Lagrangian formulation.

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:15.740
We did not talk about
this formulation

00:20:15.740 --> 00:20:16.930
in the earlier lectures.

00:20:16.930 --> 00:20:20.090
We did talk about this
formulation, but not about

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:21.610
that formulation.

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:24.210
This formulation really
is best covered

00:20:24.210 --> 00:20:26.290
in a separate lecture.

00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:30.000
However, it's still very
interesting to look at the

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.270
solution results that we obtain
we this formulation.

00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:36.190
If you want to read up on this
formulation, please refer to

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.440
the study guide in which
a reference given.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.160
A paper is referred
to in which this

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.630
formulation is described.

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:48.610
So let us now look at the
solution results obtained from

00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:52.010
these three formulations.

00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.110
And the solution results that
we want to look at are once

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:58.650
again the force displacement
curve for each of these

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.720
formulations.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:04.830
In other words, force applies
here, displacement seen here,

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.540
for these three formulations.

00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:11.345
Let's turn back to the
laboratory and see what are

00:21:11.345 --> 00:21:14.110
the results.

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:17.390
Here we see the analysis results
for the MNO, that is

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:21.100
the materially nonlinear only,
the TL, that is the total

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:24.140
Lagrangian, and to UL, that
is the updated Lagrangian

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:26.930
formulations.

00:21:26.930 --> 00:21:29.670
We look first at the horizontal
axis scale giving

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:30.920
the displacement.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.540
And then at the vertical axis
scale giving the load that is

00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.830
the pressure applied.

00:21:40.830 --> 00:21:43.490
Notice that there are three, in
fact we will we later four

00:21:43.490 --> 00:21:44.910
distinct curves.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.840
However, under this much
plasticity, the curves are

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.210
almost the same.

00:21:50.210 --> 00:21:52.840
The TL analysis results
corresponds to the smallest

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.100
displacements.

00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:57.160
The MNO solution gives
larger displacements.

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.535
And the UL solution gives the
largest displacements.

00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:05.890
For the UL solution, we actually
see two curves when

00:22:05.890 --> 00:22:07.310
looking closely.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:11.460
These correspond to using once
14 steps as for the TL and MNO

00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:14.030
analyses and then using
once twice the

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:15.620
number of load steps.

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.400
Note that the unloading response
in all solutions is

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.690
quite the same.

00:22:20.690 --> 00:22:23.270
However, of course, the
permanent displacements at 0

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:25.990
applied load are quite different
because the maximum

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:30.070
displacements corresponding to
peak load were different.

00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.640
These analysis results underline
the importance of

00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.100
choosing the appropriate
kinematic

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.310
formation for the analysis.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:38.980
Here, large strain effects are
quite significant at the very

00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.230
high load levels.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:47.230
In the next analysis we now
consider the effect of a shaft

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:48.890
in the hole.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:52.830
Notice, we look at the same
plate as before except that we

00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:56.880
know first consider elastic
condition only.

00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:59.190
And the shaft is shown here.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.310
The shaft has this Young's
modulus and Poisson ratio,

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.310
same as the plate.

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:08.230
But it is 5 times thicker than
the plate and for the shaft we

00:23:08.230 --> 00:23:11.760
also consider plane strength
conditions.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.530
What we want to do is place a
shaft in there, the shaft

00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:20.200
being initially flush with the
hole, assuming no friction

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.160
between the shaft
and the hole.

00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:27.240
And then we pull on the plate
and want to investigate what

00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:30.320
is the effect of having
that shaft there.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:35.720
The analysis input data have to
now be modified because we

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:40.760
have to put the shaft in there
using finite elements as shown

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:41.930
here in red.

00:23:41.930 --> 00:23:43.620
We used collapsed 8-node
elements to

00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:45.190
represent the shaft.

00:23:45.190 --> 00:23:47.730
In other words, these collapsed
8-node isoparametric

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:49.580
elements become, of
course, triangular

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.760
elements as shown here.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.330
Notice we now have a contact
surface here.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.530
And that contact surface is
modeled using a contact

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:01.150
algorithm, which we did
not talk about in

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.570
this series of lectures.

00:24:03.570 --> 00:24:08.560
This again, would be best
covered in another lecture.

00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:12.990
I'd like to refer you here to
another paper, the reference

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:15.800
of which is also given in the
study guide, if you're

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.590
interested in reading about
the contact algorithm.

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:21.050
The contact algorithm can take
into account friction

00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:24.570
conditions as well, but in this
particular analysis, we

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:29.820
assume 0 friction along
the contact surface.

00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:33.570
The solution procedure that we
are using is it the full

00:24:33.570 --> 00:24:36.480
Newton method without
line searches.

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:38.830
And the convergence criteria
that we are

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.480
using are listed here.

00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.480
These we have been talking
about earlier already.

00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.260
Here we now because of the
contact conditions have to

00:24:46.260 --> 00:24:50.370
introduce also this convergence
criterion, which

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.860
is really a convergence
criterion on the incremental

00:24:52.860 --> 00:24:55.440
contact force.

00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:58.200
So let us now proceed
with this analysis.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:02.730
And once again, we perform the
analysis and of course, we're

00:25:02.730 --> 00:25:05.470
looking at solution results.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.170
Here we see the mesh of the
plate once more, the mesh we

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:10.120
used in the previous analyses.

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.310
We now need to change the input
data for the analysis to

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:15.890
also define the shaft.

00:25:15.890 --> 00:25:18.500
This is done using ADINA-IN.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:21.390
We need to define the addition
nodal points and elements for

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:24.380
the shaft in the same way as
we input earlier the nodal

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.110
points and elements
of the plate.

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:29.570
Let's look at the information
that defines the content

00:25:29.570 --> 00:25:31.760
condition between the
plate and the shaft.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.990
And here we see the input
for ADINA-IN.

00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:37.550
There are two contact
surfaces.

00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:40.250
The one is the plate hole
surface and the other is the

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:41.960
shaft surface.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:45.280
We denote these two to be
a contact surface pair.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.200
Here you now see the mesh of
the shaft and the plate.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.225
The shaft is defined by
triangular elements.

00:25:53.730 --> 00:25:56.430
Here we see the default
mesh at maximum load.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:59.170
Note that the plate has been
extended vertically and has

00:25:59.170 --> 00:26:01.850
shrunk horizontally.

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:04.250
The shaft has prevented the
hole to shrink much

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:05.400
horizontally.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.970
And on top off the shaft,
a gap has opened.

00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:12.130
All of these deformations
are quite realistic.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:14.760
Here, we see just the shaft and
the ring of elements of

00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:16.300
the plate around it.

00:26:16.300 --> 00:26:19.840
Once again, the calculated
deformations make sense.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:22.610
If you look closely at the shaft
by itself, you observe

00:26:22.610 --> 00:26:26.990
that it has been compressed
horizontally by the plate.

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:29.790
Let's look next at some
stress vector plots.

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:32.270
These also show that a
physically realistic solution

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:34.680
has been obtained.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:37.180
Here we see the stress vectors
in the element layer of the

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:39.030
plate around the shaft.

00:26:39.030 --> 00:26:41.070
Note that the stress vectors
are plotted onto

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.050
the original mesh.

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.030
For the element adjacent to the
horizontal symmetry axis

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:49.750
off the plate, we see a vertical
tensile stress and a

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:52.170
horizontal compressive stress.

00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:54.700
Such stresses are
to be expected.

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:57.240
The horizontal compressive
stress is, of course, due to

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.600
the contact with the shaft.

00:27:02.250 --> 00:27:04.830
Note that going around the
shaft, the stresses in the

00:27:04.830 --> 00:27:08.310
plate align to be parallel to
the free surface of the hole,

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:11.070
since there is only contact near
the horizontal symmetry

00:27:11.070 --> 00:27:13.060
axis of the plate.

00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.510
This completes what I wanted to
discuss with you for this

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:18.540
phase of the analysis.

00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:21.390
Finally, I would like to look
with you at the analysis

00:27:21.390 --> 00:27:26.070
results we obtained when we
apply to this plate with the

00:27:26.070 --> 00:27:30.000
shaft 100 MPa up there
and down here.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.910
We assume that they plate
is made of an

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:34.380
elasto-plastic material.

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.540
In fact, we model that
material as shown

00:27:37.540 --> 00:27:39.850
in our early analysis.

00:27:39.850 --> 00:27:44.130
And in addition to this loading
here shown, also the

00:27:44.130 --> 00:27:45.930
shaft expands.

00:27:45.930 --> 00:27:48.680
It expands uniformly.

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:53.490
And in fact, it expands 0.05%
based on the initial

00:27:53.490 --> 00:27:58.570
dimensions of the shaft during
each load step and we apply 10

00:27:58.570 --> 00:27:59.950
load steps.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:03.870
So the loading then all together
is in the first load

00:28:03.870 --> 00:28:06.770
step, 100 MPa applied here.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:12.610
And from the second to 11th load
step, we expand the shaft

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:18.570
by 0.05% in diameter, so to
say, based on the initial

00:28:18.570 --> 00:28:20.550
dimensions.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:23.850
We use the updated Lagrangian
formulation to model the

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:25.520
response of the plate.

00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.850
Let's look now at these
analysis results.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:31.780
Here we see just as a
reminder once more

00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.350
the mesh we are using.

00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:35.542
Also, here is once more
the detail of the

00:28:35.542 --> 00:28:37.880
mesh around the shaft.

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:41.410
This is the default
mesh at step 1.

00:28:41.410 --> 00:28:44.070
The deformations are due to the
tensile load of the 100

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:47.140
megapascals on the plate.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:51.140
Next we plot the plastic zones
in the plate as they develop

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.330
when the shaft expands.

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:56.500
Notice again the time code above
the mesh giving the step

00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.010
number since delta t equals 1.

00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:01.750
There are all together
11 steps.

00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:06.320
The shaft expands from step
2 step to step 11.

00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:09.500
We see the time code running and
at time 7 we see the first

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:10.750
plasticity.

00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:16.270
This plasticity spreads as the
shaft further expands.

00:29:16.270 --> 00:29:19.210
The maximum plastic zone is,
of course, reached at the

00:29:19.210 --> 00:29:24.560
maximum expansion of the shaft,
that is at time 11.

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.000
This completes what I wanted
to say about this analysis.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:30.480
Note that after each analysis
step we looked at the

00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.880
calculated deformations and
stresses is to identify

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.420
whether these make sense.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.540
This brings us to the end of
this lecture and to the end of

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:40.500
this course.

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:43.500
I'd like to now just take a few
minutes for some closing

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.840
remarks regarding the course.

00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.400
I mentioned already in the first
lecture that nonlinear

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.880
finite element analysis
is a very large field.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.110
There are continuum mechanics
principles, numerical

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:57.460
algorithms, and software
considerations.

00:29:57.460 --> 00:30:02.140
We could not cover in detail
many aspects of all of these

00:30:02.140 --> 00:30:04.850
fields in these 22 lectures.

00:30:04.850 --> 00:30:08.630
However, I do believe that the
22 lectures provide a good

00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:12.200
introduction and a good
foundation for further study.

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.890
I would hope that you would
listen to these lectures with

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.670
your colleagues, that these
lectures would initiate

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:22.280
discussions, stimulations for
your work in nonlinear

00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.860
analysis and, of course,
also questions.

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.500
We at MIT continue to
work in nonlinear

00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:30.160
finite element analysis.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.520
And we also offer from time
to time weekly courses.

00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:36.330
I would be glad to see some
off you at these weekly

00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:40.130
courses to share some of the
experiences that you have had

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:44.930
listening to these video
lectures and also regarding

00:30:44.930 --> 00:30:47.460
your work in practice.

00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:51.040
Finally, I'd like to mention
that a video course of this

00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:54.750
nature can only be produced
through the concerted effort

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.420
of a number of very
devoted people.

00:30:57.420 --> 00:31:00.660
I'd like to thank for their
collaboration and support Dick

00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.820
Norris, Elizabeth DeRienzo,
Pat [? Regan ?]

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.420
of the Center of Advanced
Engineering Study at MIT, and

00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.650
Ted Sussman, my student.

00:31:09.650 --> 00:31:14.630
And very finally, thanks also
for the crew around here.

00:31:14.630 --> 00:31:15.880
Thank you for your attention.

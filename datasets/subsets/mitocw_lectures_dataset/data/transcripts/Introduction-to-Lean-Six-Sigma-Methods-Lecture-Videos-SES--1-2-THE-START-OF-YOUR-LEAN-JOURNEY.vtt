00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.687
EARLL MURMAN: OK, well, this
is literally, for most of you,

00:00:29.687 --> 00:00:31.520
the start of your lean
journey because we've

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.960
seen the value of data, and
we know that, for many of you,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.790
this whole subject
matter is something

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.477
you've hardly heard about.

00:00:39.477 --> 00:00:41.060
And that's perfect
because that's what

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.800
this course is designed for.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.390
So welcome.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.400
So, at the end of
this module, we

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.370
hope you'll be able to explain
the origins of Lean and Six

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.210
Sigma, explain the lean 6S tool.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.982
You're going to learn
your first lean tool here.

00:00:56.982 --> 00:00:58.940
You're going to be able
to define what is lean,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.030
what's a lean enterprise,
and who are stakeholders

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.140
of the lean enterprise.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.810
You'll recognize why
Lean Six Sigma principles

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.628
are being implemented
in aerospace,

00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:10.920
health care, and other sectors.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.980
We're going to talk about
why these sectors are

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.840
moving in this direction.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.110
And you'll be able to explain
that lean is a journey.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.290
It's not a state.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.330
You never are lean.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.665
You're always trying
to become lean.

00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:25.290
And we'll talk a
little bit about that.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.020
So this subject matter comes
out of the Japanese automotive

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.860
industry.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.410
And, unlike aerospace
engineering and structures

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:43.640
and controls and
aerodynamics where

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.445
you can go to the laboratory
and see what's happening

00:01:46.445 --> 00:01:48.320
and do experiments and
things, in this field,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.600
you have to go to
where it's actually

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.050
being practiced because
the body of knowledge

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.030
comes from that field.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.010
So this all kind of came
to the surface in 1990

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.440
when MIT published a book
called The Machine That

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.160
Changed the World.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.820
It was a study of the
Japanese, North American,

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.740
and European automotive
manufacturing.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.210
And this is a plot given
then of production of cars.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.010
These are all the US
car manufacturers,

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.390
and here's Japan.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.950
And what do you
see in that chart?

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.150
What jumps out at you?

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.300
What's the first thing you see?

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.100
AUDIENCE: Japan is increasing
a lot faster than US

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.650
and passes us in--

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:34.900
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah, close to--

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.320
AUDIENCE: --1980.

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.420
EARLL MURMAN: It's
now kept going.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.177
EARLL MURMAN: So
that's one thing.

00:02:38.177 --> 00:02:39.880
Japan has just steady growth.

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.225
What's the next thing you see?

00:02:42.225 --> 00:02:43.600
AUDIENCE: It's
pretty consistent.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.130
EARLL MURMAN:
Inconsistent, right.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.905
This is the typical US thing.

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:50.030
You kind of overproduce,
underproduce, overproduce.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.240
And the Japanese are
nice, smooth, and steady.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.740
There's a lot of data in The
Machine That Changed the World.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.030
And we're not going to
go through all this,

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.900
but I want to make
a couple of points.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.410
First of all, the
data in this chart

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.650
is product development
and manufacturing.

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.030
Now, a big mistake a
lot of US companies

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.160
made when they read
this book was that lean

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.990
is a manufacturing paradigm.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.370
It's a manufacturing system.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.120
In fact, most of my friends,
when they talk to me say,

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.370
oh, you're in lean
manufacturing.

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.170
The Japanese never
saw it that way.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.110
They implement lean right back
in engineering and product

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.820
development.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:24.740
So, in product
development, for instance,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.150
the average engineering hours
in a new car, 1.7 million

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.210
for Japanese, 3.1 million
for US, almost twice

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.220
the number of engineering
hours for the same car.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.790
Supplier share of engineering,
how many of the suppliers

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.440
are actually doing
engineering compared

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:44.820
to just supplying parts?

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.950
51% in Japan, 14% in US.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.950
So we're going to be
talking about that tomorrow

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.390
in the engineering section.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.880
That's design.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.050
Here's production.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.090
Let's just get a
couple of numbers.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.780
Quality defects per 100
vehicles, 60 for Japanese,

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.480
82 for US.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:13.850
Training hours of new workers,
380 for Japan, 46 for US.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.450
That's probably not because the
Japanese need more training.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.750
It's probably because Japan
invests more in training.

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:26.750
So this is what started
the whole lean activity

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.280
around the world and in the US.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.780
Now, how does lean compare--

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.370
what are the
fundamental comparisons

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.787
of lean with what
we already know?

00:04:32.787 --> 00:04:37.790
Well, we have here lean
thinking, mass production,

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:40.070
and craft production as
sort of three paradigms.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.660
Let's just-- we're going
to spend a bit of time

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.118
on this chart
because this is going

00:04:43.118 --> 00:04:45.750
to set your thoughts
for the whole course.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.480
So let's look at these
are different focus areas.

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.150
So, in operations,
in a craft thing,

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.090
a person is working
on a single item.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.363
In mass production, the idea
is you make a lot of them,

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:57.530
and you put them in a queue.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.900
You make more, and you
put them in a queue.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.940
In lean thinking, it's all flow.

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:04.640
Everything is flowing very
smoothly and synchronized.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.920
And we're going to
talk a lot about flow.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.670
What's the overall aim?

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.400
In craft, it was the
mastery of the craft.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.830
In mass production,
it's reduced unit cost

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.360
and increased efficiency.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.820
In lean, it's
eliminating all waste

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.777
and only doing
value-added activities.

00:05:22.777 --> 00:05:24.610
You're going to be
hearing a lot about this.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.160
By the way, most of the things
that we talk about today,

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.740
we're going to come back
and talk about tomorrow.

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:29.970
And then we're going to
come back and talk about

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:30.910
on Wednesday.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.240
So, if something
goes by you today

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.830
and you go home and say I
don't think I really got it,

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:37.288
that's good because
tomorrow you're

00:05:37.288 --> 00:05:38.790
going to get it again probably.

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.957
So we're going to be talking
about all these things.

00:05:40.957 --> 00:05:43.830
Quality, in craft
production, it was just

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:45.000
part of how they did things.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.750
It was integrated into
their whole system.

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:50.110
In mass production, quality
was treated as a second step.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.120
We inspect, and we correct.

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.040
In lean thinking, it's built--

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.290
the quality is built in at
every step of the whole activity

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:01.580
from engineering right
through production.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.960
And one of the things that was
so hard for Westerners to grasp

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:09.730
was most Westerners thought
I'll give you a quality output,

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:11.650
but it's going to
cost you more money.

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:14.910
And what the Japanese found was
I'll give you a quality output,

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:16.750
and it costs less money.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.493
Quality-- and this is really
important in health care.

00:06:19.493 --> 00:06:21.160
This is really important
in health care.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.840
Focusing on quality
will drive down cost.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.400
It always has.

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.290
Business strategy here
was customization.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.600
Here it's economies of
scale and automation.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.480
Here it's being flexible and
adaptable to the changing

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.740
customer demands.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.220
And I think this is really the
heart of lean, this last one.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.260
In the craft, who
does the improvement?

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.460
In the craft world, it was
the master-driven continuous

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.600
improvement.

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.100
In the mass production
world, it was

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.808
the expert-driven
periodic improvement.

00:06:50.808 --> 00:06:52.350
We'd bring in the
consulting company.

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:54.150
They'd tell us how to improve.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.370
Here it's the worker
does the improvement

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.440
in a continuous way.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:01.080
The worker is a
continuous problem solver.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.970
So I spent a lot of
time on that chart

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.310
because this really sets
up the whole course.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:09.550
And, when we wrote
a book on this,

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.470
we struggled with
how we define lean.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.970
And here's the term
we came up with.

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:17.260
Lean thinking is the
dynamic, knowledge-driven,

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.810
customer-focused
process through which

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:23.590
all people in an enterprise
continuously eliminate waste

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.520
and create value.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.020
So you guys are actually little
enterprises for this course.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.978
You guys are going to be
airplane manufacturing

00:07:29.978 --> 00:07:30.750
enterprises.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:33.450
And you guys are
going to be clinics.

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:35.970
And tomorrow, when we
do our LEGO simulations,

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.830
you're going to be
applying these principles

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.426
in your enterprises.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.320
OK, so what about
Lean and Six Sigma?

00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:47.693
They're very interrelated.

00:07:47.693 --> 00:07:49.610
They came from somewhat
different backgrounds.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:51.350
Six Sigma was
developed by Motorola

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:55.880
in the 1980s when they decided
that the big problem they had

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.220
was that all their processes
had too much variation.

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.195
So, when they built
something, they

00:08:01.195 --> 00:08:03.070
weren't sure what the
output was going to be.

00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:05.690
And so they didn't have very
good what you might call yield.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:08.540
They had a lot of scrap
and not just in production,

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.540
but in office processes
and everything.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:15.130
So Motorola focused on reducing
the variation of every process

00:08:15.130 --> 00:08:18.970
so that every process would
have a predictable output

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:20.930
to deliver value
to their customers.

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:24.300
It was very problem
focused, and the assumption

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.420
is you've got a--

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.700
that a process isn't working.

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.850
So you go, and you do a very
kind of quantitative analysis

00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:33.360
and fix that process and
get the variation down.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.150
Lean has the same end
objective of delivering value

00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:38.789
to the customer,
but its focus is

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:41.370
to reduce waste, to get all
the waste out of the system.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:43.289
And we'll find out that
most of the thing--

00:08:43.289 --> 00:08:46.290
most of the inefficiency
is not the people.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.760
It's the system in which the
people are working is wasteful.

00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:53.500
And it's focused on
keeping everything flowing.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:56.280
And so the assumption is that
waste removal will improve

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.010
businesses and that many
small improvements are

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:00.510
better than a big, giant step.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:04.350
So lean is very much a process
of starting where you are,

00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:06.720
taking whatever system
you have, making

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.300
it a little bit better or a
lot better, and then making it

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:11.190
a lot better and then
making it a lot better

00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.940
and just continually
trying to improve it.

00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:14.190
And that's why it's a journey.

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:23.950
Now, what's happened over the
past 10, 15 years is that--

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:25.917
well, let me back up
and say, 15 years ago,

00:09:25.917 --> 00:09:28.000
there were people saying,
oh, I'm doing Six Sigma,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.410
or I'm doing lean.

00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.240
It was like there
were two camps.

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.440
And, luckily, eventually
we got past that,

00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.890
and most organizations
now pick some portions

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:43.790
of lean, some portions of Six
Sigma, and bring them together.

00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:47.120
We think of lean as sort
of optimizing flow and Six

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.520
Sigma as reducing variation.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.370
And the body of knowledges
have come together

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:54.620
into something that's generally
called Lean Six Sigma.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.440
There are books you can
buy called Lean Six Sigma.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:10:00.140
And what happens
is an enterprise

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:03.810
will look at these principles.

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.720
They will tailor their
own version of it.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.790
They will name it and brand it.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.570
And it becomes their operating
strategy or their improvement

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.710
strategy.

00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:16.270
So Textron calls theirs
Textron Six Sigma.

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:19.500
Virginia Mason Medical Center
calls it the Virginia Mason

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.860
Production System.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.678
Some of you are
either going to work

00:10:22.678 --> 00:10:23.970
or have been working at Boeing.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.640
They call theirs Lean+ now.

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.032
And I was talking with
Susan a little earlier.

00:10:29.032 --> 00:10:30.990
Dartmouth, which is a
real leader in this area,

00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.180
doesn't even call
it lean at all.

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:34.360
And that doesn't matter.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.400
It's that the organization
understands their process

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.340
improvement and identifies with
it and takes ownership of it

00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:44.880
and doesn't get hung
up on what the name is.

00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:48.210
So our course is going to
cover all the principles that

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:49.350
underlie all these things.

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.370
If you are going--

00:10:50.370 --> 00:10:53.640
if you were in a company or
a hospital in which they're

00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.770
training, they would give
you specific training

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.980
on their system because
you're working for them.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:00.480
But you're all going
to go somewhere

00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.785
else, different places.

00:11:01.785 --> 00:11:03.660
So what we give you are
the fundamentals that

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:06.130
apply to any of those systems.

00:11:06.130 --> 00:11:07.960
Let's wind up the first
part of this module

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.630
with a slide that shows
how important people are

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:13.240
in implementing
continuous improvement.

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.270
I often hear that there
are two jobs we all have.

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:18.490
One job is the work we
do, and the other job

00:11:18.490 --> 00:11:20.680
is improving how we do our work.

00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.930
And we're going to emphasize
the importance of people

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:26.590
in implementing lean thinking
throughout the whole course.

00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:28.590
And we'll even get ahead
of it in this exercise

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.023
we're now going to do.

00:11:30.023 --> 00:11:30.940
That's the background.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.860
Now, let's get some
of these specifics.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.900
On the right-hand
side of your folder

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.230
is an exercise that
looks like this.

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.980
And take it out, and
don't open it up yet.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:40.147
Just put it in front of you.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.050
OK, this is called 6S.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.005
Now, there are two
versions of this out there.

00:11:48.005 --> 00:11:49.260
There are multiple versions.

00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:50.440
There's 5S and 6S.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.328
So 5S came from the Japanese.

00:11:53.328 --> 00:11:55.370
They were Japanese words,
which I don't remember,

00:11:55.370 --> 00:11:59.580
but they've been translated
into basically sort,

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.430
straighten, scrub,
standardize, and sustain.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:05.490
And this is a way of improving
your work environment,

00:12:05.490 --> 00:12:05.990
very simple.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.532
And we'll talk a
little bit about it.

00:12:07.532 --> 00:12:09.960
Now, what happened when this
came to the Western world?

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:13.110
The Western world said, ah,
safety, that starts with an S

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.740
too.

00:12:13.740 --> 00:12:15.050
And safety is very important.

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:19.620
So we'll make it 6S, and we'll
add safety onto the list.

00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:21.750
And, when we put--
this is the only place

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.360
in the course where we've
actually taken something

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.280
that we didn't
observe in the field.

00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:30.580
When we did this, we thought
that's kind of an afterthought

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.260
just to put safety
at the end of a list.

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:33.885
And safety is more
important than that.

00:12:33.885 --> 00:12:36.640
So either leave it off, or, if
you're going to integrate it,

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:37.270
integrate it.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.260
And so we put it
as the second S.

00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:41.680
And we call it safe,
which is an action verb.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.740
This is probably the only place
you'll see this version of 6S,

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:45.500
but that's OK.

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.320
Don't worry about that.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.320
So what we're going
to do is we're

00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.030
going to do a little exercise.

00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:53.130
And this is your
workplace for right now.

00:12:53.130 --> 00:12:54.678
This is your work environment.

00:12:54.678 --> 00:12:56.220
And we're going to
try to improve it,

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.395
applying the basic
principles of 6S.

00:12:58.395 --> 00:13:00.270
And we're going to do
it in 20-second rounds.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.812
You can think of
each 20-second round

00:13:01.812 --> 00:13:04.440
as maybe a work shift
or something like that.

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:06.120
And you have a
bunch of supplies.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.642
And this is in the
medical context,

00:13:07.642 --> 00:13:08.850
but we could do it otherwise.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:12.840
You have some instruments, some
bandages, and some medications.

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.180
And you're going to--
each of your work shifts,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:20.570
you're going to be asked to
fetch some of these supplies

00:13:20.570 --> 00:13:22.610
from your storeroom.

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:25.400
And don't turn it over yet,
but the first page represents

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:28.010
your current work environment.

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:31.160
And then each next
slide will show you

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.247
what you have to fetch
in your first work shift.

00:13:33.247 --> 00:13:35.330
And, when you fetch it,
so what you're going to do

00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:37.333
is just put an X through
whatever you fetch.

00:13:37.333 --> 00:13:39.500
Or, if you want to circle
it, you could do that too.

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.227
I don't care.

00:13:40.227 --> 00:13:41.810
OK, so here's what
we're going to need

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.360
to get on the first round.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.540
You're going to have
to find five syringes,

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:49.000
five of these Band-Aids,
five scissors,

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.730
and five of the medication II's.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:55.370
So don't do it yet,
but, when I say go,

00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:59.860
you're going to flip the page,
cross off five of each of these

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.850
until I say stop.

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:02.800
And that's the end of the shift.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.470
OK, any questions on
the mechanics of it?

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.380
OK, so we'll do ready, set, go.

00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.990
Stop.

00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:22.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:23.670
Shift is over.

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:26.210
Time to go home.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.620
OK, so now count up the number
of items, total number of items

00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:30.120
you got.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.460
I don't need to know
items by category,

00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:33.820
just the total number of items.

00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.190
OK, super.

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:40.820
OK, how many are kind
of around 8, 9, 10?

00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:43.130
OK, probably 10 is
roughly about the middle.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:45.590
We don't have to be too careful.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:49.750
So this is kind
of our workplace.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.410
Well, what do we see?

00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.430
OK, we didn't get the job done.

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:59.370
And there's high
variability, OK?

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:01.400
We have about-- let's see.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.680
We have about 25, 28
workers here in our plant.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.270
And we get quite a
variable outcome.

00:15:06.270 --> 00:15:08.728
This is the kind of thing Six
Sigma was worried about, high

00:15:08.728 --> 00:15:09.930
variability.

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:14.630
OK, so that's where
we're starting.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.883
Now, our first S is to sort.

00:15:17.883 --> 00:15:19.550
And you probably saw,
in your workplace,

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:20.810
there's a lot of
stuff there that you

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:21.852
don't have to go collect.

00:15:21.852 --> 00:15:24.560
There's some old equipment
that's in your storeroom.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.890
There may be some medications
that have been there.

00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:29.960
When this first started,
a lot of these companies

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:32.270
go into the storeroom,
and they find out

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:35.540
that somebody in purchasing
got a good deal some time

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:39.050
on some piece of some
equipment or supply.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.460
They got a volume discount.

00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:41.990
They bought 10
years worth of it.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:44.450
And, a year later, they
stopped using that stuff.

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.300
And then another nine years
are still in the storeroom.

00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:48.405
That's waste, OK?

00:15:48.405 --> 00:15:50.030
So what we're going
to do is we're just

00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:53.180
going to go through and
clean up, get everything out

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.850
of the workplace that
we're not looking for.

00:15:55.850 --> 00:15:57.420
And then we're
going to redo this.

00:15:57.420 --> 00:15:59.888
So it's the same thing, but
now we've gotten rid of all

00:15:59.888 --> 00:16:01.430
the clutter, but
we're going to get--

00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:02.910
just so we take
the learning out,

00:16:02.910 --> 00:16:05.600
we're going to get now five
tape rolls, five Band-Aids,

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.370
five tweezers, and
five medication III's.

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:11.560
OK, ready, set, go.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:20.080
Stop.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:21.520
OK, now, we count them up again.

00:16:21.520 --> 00:16:24.660
And then we'll see
where we're at.

00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:27.990
OK, anybody get all 20?

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:29.670
19?

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:30.520
19, OK.

00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:39.020
OK, how many are around 15, 15?

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:41.330
OK, that's good enough.

00:16:41.330 --> 00:16:43.638
OK.

00:16:43.638 --> 00:16:45.470
AUDIENCE: 25.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.667
EARLL MURMAN: 25?

00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:49.052
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:49.052 --> 00:16:52.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:55.900
EARLL MURMAN: So you've
made a-- you've made a--

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:57.964
we're going to talk a lot.

00:16:57.964 --> 00:17:03.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:08.740
EARLL MURMAN: So,
just a heads up,

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:10.960
one of the things about
lean is you're trying

00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.550
to meet your customer's demand.

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.329
And you exceeded
customer demand.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:16.510
OK, sometimes, the customer
won't pay you for it,

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.099
but, this time,
it's probably OK.

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:20.670
How many got-- look
at your medications.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:23.879
Did anybody get a medication
I or a medication II?

00:17:23.879 --> 00:17:24.421
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:17:24.421 --> 00:17:25.339
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
that one is right.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:25.799
That one is right.

00:17:25.799 --> 00:17:26.466
AUDIENCE: I did.

00:17:26.466 --> 00:17:27.639
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah.

00:17:27.639 --> 00:17:28.559
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:30.850
EARLL MURMAN: Ah, OK.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:36.070
OK, so now we're going to safe.

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:39.230
Getting the wrong
medications is a big problem.

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:41.173
So that's an example
of why we set it up--

00:17:41.173 --> 00:17:42.340
that's why we put safe here.

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.090
So safe is just making
the workplace safe.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.990
If your workers get injured
or if the customers get

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:52.260
injured or suppliers get
injured, that's pure waste.

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:57.500
That's lost time that they can't
contribute to your enterprise.

00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.330
So safety is not good-- safety
is important for many reasons,

00:18:02.330 --> 00:18:04.680
but it's very much
a lean principle.

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.500
You don't want anything that--

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.290
well, I've always said
accidents are waste.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:11.840
So we've gone in, and we've
made our workplace a little safe

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:12.590
now.

00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:16.370
We've put sheaths
on our syringes.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:18.440
We've made the medications
different shapes.

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.610
We've closed the scissors.

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:23.540
And so we're going to do the
same thing, get 20 items.

00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.060
And ready, set, go.

00:18:30.670 --> 00:18:31.170
Stop.

00:18:35.045 --> 00:18:36.920
I think everybody has
got the mechanics down.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:43.580
OK, anybody get 10
or less than 10?

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.480
12?

00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.052
11?

00:18:47.052 --> 00:18:47.552
11?

00:18:47.552 --> 00:18:47.964
AUDIENCE: 12.

00:18:47.964 --> 00:18:49.090
EARLL MURMAN: 11, 11, 12.

00:18:49.090 --> 00:18:52.570
OK, we had a little bit
of improvement here.

00:18:52.570 --> 00:18:55.300
Anybody get all 20?

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.090
18?

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.690
19?

00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.600
19, OK.

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:12.260
OK, how about 16,
17, 18, 15, 14?

00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:13.610
OK, it's kind of hard to see.

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:16.680
I think we're maybe a little
bit better than before,

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.750
but about the same.

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:22.220
So we've closed down the
variation a little bit.

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.463
We didn't expect to get too
much improvement in productivity

00:19:25.463 --> 00:19:27.630
because all we did was we
made the environment safe.

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:31.510
We didn't really do
any reorganization.

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:33.130
OK, now we're going
to straighten.

00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.880
Now, that we've gotten
all the clutter out

00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:36.040
and we've made things
safe, now, let's

00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.998
get our workplace a little
bit better organized

00:19:37.998 --> 00:19:39.260
so it's not so helter-skelter.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.760
So we're going to
straighten things.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.580
So we've installed some
racks in our storeroom.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:48.330
Because management has seen this
great increase in productivity,

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.760
they're going to ask for
more now on the shift.

00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.940
They want 25.

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.000
They want 25 things found.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.220
OK, so you can see
the list up there.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:00.410
OK, ready, set, go.

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:08.170
Stop.

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:11.290
OK, anybody 15 or less?

00:20:11.290 --> 00:20:11.790
How many?

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:12.390
AUDIENCE: 14.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:13.338
EARLL MURMAN: 14.

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:13.880
AUDIENCE: 14.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.300
EARLL MURMAN: 14.

00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:14.990
OK, 14.

00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.760
OK.

00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:16.640
AUDIENCE: 15.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.598
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah, you
got 15, but she got 14.

00:20:18.598 --> 00:20:19.170
What did you?

00:20:19.170 --> 00:20:20.110
AUDIENCE: I got 15.

00:20:20.110 --> 00:20:21.030
EARLL MURMAN: 15, OK.

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:24.040
Anybody get 25?

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.540
24?

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.540
23?

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.470
23, OK.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:34.390
And how many are 19, 20, 21?

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:37.420
OK, that looks like we're
about in the middle here.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.450
OK, well, we see the increase
in productivity there.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:44.170
OK, now the next S is to
basically clean things up,

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:45.040
to scrub.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.410
By the way, in
these charts, there

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:50.510
are multiple translations
of the Japanese word.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.760
And we've given them all here.

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.130
So, for scrub, it's
scrub, shine, or sweep

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.840
you might find in a particular
5 or 6S incarnation.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.250
And that's pretty important.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:01.917
Of course, in a health
care environment,

00:21:01.917 --> 00:21:04.370
it's critical for
all sorts of reasons.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:07.210
But, in an aerospace environment
or a production environment,

00:21:07.210 --> 00:21:10.450
you can walk-- a lean
factory, you can walk into,

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:12.550
and you can eat off the floor.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.480
I mean, we'll see.

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:16.780
We're going to have a
video of New Balance shoe.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.090
And you'll see, when we
get into that factory,

00:21:19.090 --> 00:21:21.490
how clean it is and well lit.

00:21:21.490 --> 00:21:23.710
Everything is clean.

00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:26.780
It's just a way of thinking.

00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:30.820
So keeping your workplace tidy
and neat is just part of it.

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.350
We can't find a good way
to do that exercise here.

00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:36.947
So we're going to skip this
S and move on to standardize.

00:21:36.947 --> 00:21:38.530
So now we want to
make it-- now, we've

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.822
got everything straightened up.

00:21:39.822 --> 00:21:41.740
Now, we make it really
easy to find things.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:45.870
So we've got three clinics here.

00:21:45.870 --> 00:21:49.162
It'd be nice if each clinic had
its own way of storing things.

00:21:49.162 --> 00:21:51.120
OK, and we're going to
talk about that tomorrow

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.260
in our simulation.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:54.835
Or we've got two
production facilities here.

00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:57.210
It'd be nice that, in the two
production facilities maybe

00:21:57.210 --> 00:22:00.090
of the same company, you'd have
the same way of storing things

00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:02.250
so you can go from
one to the other

00:22:02.250 --> 00:22:04.170
and not have to be trained.

00:22:04.170 --> 00:22:05.460
So we're now going to--

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.638
we've done a good job of that.

00:22:07.638 --> 00:22:08.430
We've standardized.

00:22:08.430 --> 00:22:09.330
This as an example.

00:22:09.330 --> 00:22:11.670
It's hard to see, but these
are a bunch of binders.

00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:12.940
And they just put
little tags on them

00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.023
so you can immediately see
which binder is missing

00:22:15.023 --> 00:22:17.350
because it's out of sequence.

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.800
OK, well, now we're up to 30.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.192
OK, we want to get 30
items on this round.

00:22:22.192 --> 00:22:23.650
This is the last
shift of the week.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.050
You're going to have the
weekend off after this.

00:22:27.050 --> 00:22:28.740
Ready, set, go.

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.570
Stop.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:37.592
OK, anybody get 30?

00:22:37.592 --> 00:22:38.725
AUDIENCE: I got 30.

00:22:38.725 --> 00:22:39.850
EARLL MURMAN: Look at that.

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:40.350
Wow.

00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:45.420
Anybody get 25 or less?

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:45.920
How many?

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.580
AUDIENCE: 25.

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:49.030
EARLL MURMAN: 25.

00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:50.570
OK, and how many got 30?

00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:52.680
Let's see your hands again.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:54.260
29?

00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:58.490
I mean, it's like this.

00:22:58.490 --> 00:23:00.090
OK, well, let's
look at this chart.

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:03.080
So we've gone from a system that
has high variability and low

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.470
productivity to a system
that has high productivity

00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:07.580
and low variability.

00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.600
How many of you would--

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.640
how many of you found
this environment

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:18.140
where you produced so much more
to be more stressful to work in

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.280
than this environment?

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.050
Nobody, right?

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.520
That's what lean is about.

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.310
OK, lean is about
doing simple things

00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:27.570
to improve your workplace.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.300
When I toured the Sikorsky plant
where they make the Black Hawk

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:33.780
helicopter, the plant
manager said, Earll, lean

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.420
is the focused application
of common sense.

00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.290
This is not complicated stuff.

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:44.440
And lean is not about making
the worker work harder.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:48.280
Lean is about putting the
worker in an environment where

00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:50.910
they can be more
productive and happier.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:53.320
OK, so this is
what lean is about.

00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:58.420
Most organizations start
with 5S as their first thing.

00:23:58.420 --> 00:23:59.860
And let me just share--

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:01.860
just to underline it,
I'll share you an example.

00:24:01.860 --> 00:24:04.560
So I live in the small
town of 9,000 people.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.360
The whole county only
has 30,000 people.

00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:07.860
It's a rural community.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.535
Our hospital started
adopting lean.

00:24:10.535 --> 00:24:11.910
The very first
thing they did was

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:15.210
they went into the hospital
laundry and applied 5S.

00:24:15.210 --> 00:24:17.380
The laundry was
so dysfunctional.

00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.590
They had high
turnover of employees.

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:22.530
The linens and gowns
were not on the floors

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:23.490
when they needed to be.

00:24:23.490 --> 00:24:27.030
The laundry bin, they didn't get
to the bottom of it each day,

00:24:27.030 --> 00:24:27.780
the dirty laundry.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.240
So, the next day, more
laundry was on top and so on.

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:35.240
In one week, the women in the
laundry who operate the laundry

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:37.850
took 5S with a
facilitator and a coach.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:39.950
They reorganized their laundry.

00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.970
And it went from
that to now they get

00:24:43.970 --> 00:24:45.410
all the laundry done every day.

00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:46.493
I've been in this laundry.

00:24:46.493 --> 00:24:47.857
The women are so happy.

00:24:47.857 --> 00:24:49.940
They just can't-- they
just want to tell you about

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:51.140
their workplace.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.780
They've had no turnover
since they did this.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.300
And everybody in the hospital
is affected by the laundry.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.620
And they all knew
it was a success.

00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:00.350
So, if you want to
start in a hospital,

00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:04.230
start in the laundry with 5S.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:07.700
The last S is to sustain,
often the hardest part.

00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:12.030
I like the Virginia Mason
version of it, self-discipline.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:15.830
Sustainment should be-- the trap
as you do this one-week event

00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:18.070
like I mentioned in
the laundry, and then

00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:19.440
you drift back into old habits.

00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:23.090
So the hard part is
keeping this as a mindset.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.590
Sometimes, you have
to have a chart,

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:27.510
but usually you should
just be able to do it.

00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:31.150
OK, so that's your
first lean experience.

00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:35.617
Let's now talk about why lean
is being applied in these areas.

00:25:35.617 --> 00:25:37.700
OK, we're going to look
at aerospace, health here.

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.610
And we're to look also
at New Balance shoes

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:40.793
just for three comparisons.

00:25:40.793 --> 00:25:42.710
So aerospace is a really
interesting industry.

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.693
It's a flagship industry
of the United States.

00:25:45.693 --> 00:25:47.110
It's one of these
things that goes

00:25:47.110 --> 00:25:48.820
with the image of the country.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.770
It enables the movement
of people and goods.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:56.400
It enables communication.

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.150
It's critical to
national security.

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:02.110
And it's a source of
inspiration for many people

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:03.880
for exploration.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:07.930
Now, why did aerospace
turn to adopting lean?

00:26:07.930 --> 00:26:12.750
Here's an industry where we
think we're the world's leader.

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:15.063
And I pause because we may
not be, but we think we are.

00:26:15.063 --> 00:26:16.230
But why did we turn to lean?

00:26:16.230 --> 00:26:18.860
Well, here's why.

00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:21.200
This is a study that came
out of the Sloan School

00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:23.960
by Jim Utterback that shows
the natural progression

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:27.070
of many different
industries plotted

00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:30.032
by the number of companies
in a particular industry.

00:26:30.032 --> 00:26:31.490
So this is the
typewriter industry.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:35.320
So it started in the late
1870s, and companies came in.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.330
They reached a peak
of about 80 companies.

00:26:37.330 --> 00:26:40.150
And then somewhere they
reached a peak around 1910.

00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:42.310
And then the number of
companies started declining.

00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.880
And, of course, there's probably
no typewriter companies now.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.450
What happens?

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:49.900
Well, this phase, this is
where the product architecture

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:52.180
and product characteristics
are not set.

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:55.240
So many inventors come up
with new ways of doing things.

00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:58.570
Eventually, somehow,
the best design emerges.

00:26:58.570 --> 00:27:01.450
And that's where the
market consolidates around.

00:27:01.450 --> 00:27:04.000
And then, instead, there's
not really real opportunities

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:04.750
for new companies.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:07.720
What happens is companies buy
up other companies that emerge.

00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:09.160
And, at this point,
it's very hard

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.810
to change the
product architecture.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:15.432
This keyboard we all use
came out of this era.

00:27:15.432 --> 00:27:17.890
It's pretty well known that
there's more efficient keyboard

00:27:17.890 --> 00:27:22.300
layouts, but it's impossible
to change that now.

00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:24.910
It's impossible to change it
because it's the standard.

00:27:24.910 --> 00:27:28.810
OK, here's the automobile
industry, same kind of thing

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:29.540
here.

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:33.790
The main product architecture
was the enclosed steel body.

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:34.990
Here's aerospace.

00:27:34.990 --> 00:27:37.195
Now, this is
representative aerospace.

00:27:37.195 --> 00:27:40.240
So it's probably-- it's just
some of the major companies,

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:43.600
but, throughout the
1900s up to about 1960,

00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.790
we had a growth of the
number of companies.

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:51.610
Then along came something
that looks like a 747, 707,

00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:52.390
and other things.

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:54.650
And we sort of reached
the product architecture.

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:58.420
And then we would have gone on
this decline just as companies.

00:27:58.420 --> 00:28:01.420
But we get to this point
here, and there's a plateau.

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.610
We're in the Cold War.

00:28:03.610 --> 00:28:05.930
And the government,
for strategic reasons,

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:07.540
wanted to keep a
big industrial base.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.150
So they invested in
that industrial base.

00:28:10.150 --> 00:28:13.450
When the Cold War was over,
the Secretary of Defense

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.280
invited all the CEOs of the
major aerospace companies

00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:16.780
to dinner.

00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.310
It's called "The Last Supper."

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:21.623
And he said, we don't
need this many companies.

00:28:21.623 --> 00:28:24.040
And so we're not going to have
as many, but it's up to you

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:24.830
to sort it out.

00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:26.413
We'll let the
marketplace sort it out.

00:28:26.413 --> 00:28:31.310
So Boeing buys McDonnell
Douglas, so on, and so forth.

00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:34.340
And we have now consolidation
and fewer aerospace companies.

00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:38.110
Had we not had the Cold War, we
probably would have done this.

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:43.870
But here's where aerospace--
here's where LAI started.

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:48.520
We had an industry,
which was inefficient

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.610
and couldn't survive
in the new world.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.300
And so they turned to lean.

00:28:54.300 --> 00:28:55.902
So we had a company with--

00:28:55.902 --> 00:28:57.360
companies that have
mature products

00:28:57.360 --> 00:28:59.310
can't survive on a
business strategy that's

00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:02.720
designed for early growth.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.820
Here's one of the
things that happens.

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:06.635
In an early phase,
when there's not--

00:29:06.635 --> 00:29:08.510
when the competition
really hasn't developed,

00:29:08.510 --> 00:29:10.790
you can charge what you want.

00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:14.630
You can charge what you
want for a new device.

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:16.280
And then you
subtract your costs,

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.050
and you get whatever profit.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:20.570
Competition builds
up, or the government

00:29:20.570 --> 00:29:23.733
says we're not going to pay
as much for airplanes anymore.

00:29:23.733 --> 00:29:26.810
OK, the customer sets the price.

00:29:26.810 --> 00:29:30.680
The only way for you to make a
profit is to reduce your costs.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:33.500
So you have to become
more efficient.

00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.723
It's just the way it is,
or you don't survive.

00:29:36.723 --> 00:29:39.140
Here's an example of some of
the problems in the aerospace

00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:40.760
industry.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:42.500
Here are three programs--

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.750
the second block of
the GPS satellites,

00:29:44.750 --> 00:29:47.960
the Joint Strike
Fighter, Boeing 787.

00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:51.760
These are new airplanes, years
behind schedule, one, two,

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:57.590
three, four, billion
dollars overrun, $12 billion

00:29:57.590 --> 00:30:00.470
beyond the development costs.

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:03.650
The price per unit, they're
going to buy a lot of F-35's.

00:30:03.650 --> 00:30:07.220
The price has doubled,
and it's still in trouble.

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:09.680
Other programs where their
costs and schedule is overrun is

00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.450
the F-22 and so on, the A340--

00:30:11.450 --> 00:30:13.940
A380, so on.

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:17.510
This is what's called
the burning platform.

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:19.340
The paradigm here
is people adopt lean

00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:21.420
when the platform they're
staying on is burning.

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.830
And, if they don't do something,
they're going to disappear.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.990
Now, there are so many
aerospace programs

00:30:26.990 --> 00:30:29.600
which are executed very well.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.760
And we've learned a lot
from studying those.

00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.100
So I don't want to say the
aerospace can't do anything,

00:30:34.100 --> 00:30:36.750
but there are a lot of problems
with the aerospace programs.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.840
Health care, there was a
book published in 2003 called

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:42.553
Crossing the Quality Chasm.

00:30:42.553 --> 00:30:44.470
It was published by the
Institute of Medicine.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:47.470
And the paradigm here
was this is the health

00:30:47.470 --> 00:30:48.910
care we're delivering.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.580
This is the health care
we know how to deliver.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.688
And there's such a wide gap
in quality of health care

00:30:55.688 --> 00:30:57.730
that we have a big chasm
between what we're doing

00:30:57.730 --> 00:30:59.530
and what we should be doing.

00:30:59.530 --> 00:31:02.250
And they outlined what the
objectives of health care are

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:03.720
and that these are not new aims.

00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:06.312
These are aims that have
been there for many years.

00:31:06.312 --> 00:31:07.770
And most people go
into health care

00:31:07.770 --> 00:31:10.582
because they want to do this.

00:31:10.582 --> 00:31:12.540
Probably, all of you guys
are going into health

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:13.748
care because you don't want--

00:31:13.748 --> 00:31:15.582
you probably didn't say
I picked health care

00:31:15.582 --> 00:31:17.850
because it's an inefficient
system that I can work in.

00:31:17.850 --> 00:31:19.475
You picked health
care because you want

00:31:19.475 --> 00:31:20.950
to help people and do things.

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:23.490
So we need to do that.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:24.690
OK, but what are some signs?

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:28.710
Well, I think we've all heard
about the cost of health care.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:30.713
There are different
metrics here.

00:31:30.713 --> 00:31:32.880
I don't think we have to
go through those in detail.

00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:34.330
There are quality issues.

00:31:34.330 --> 00:31:36.100
This is the one that
was staggering to me,

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:40.410
the study done in 1999
that between about 50,000

00:31:40.410 --> 00:31:42.750
and 100,000 people a
year in our country

00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:46.680
die from perfectly
preventable medical mistakes.

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:50.940
OK, that's more people
than die on the highway.

00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:53.560
And, by the way, that number
still has not changed too much.

00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:55.920
It's gotten a little bit
better maybe, but not changed.

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:59.497
Many people don't have
access to health care.

00:31:59.497 --> 00:32:01.080
This slide is a
little bit out of date

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.540
because of the Affordable
Health Care Act.

00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:08.565
And 60% of the
doctors in the survey

00:32:08.565 --> 00:32:10.690
said they wouldn't recommend
going into health care

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.490
to their children.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:14.970
Here we've got Bo is an
emergency doctor, emergency

00:32:14.970 --> 00:32:15.790
medicine doctor.

00:32:15.790 --> 00:32:19.140
Is 50% of your time
spent on paperwork?

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.648
AUDIENCE: On waste
on a good day.

00:32:20.648 --> 00:32:22.440
EARLL MURMAN: On a good
day, 50% is wasted.

00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.080
And Susan is a nurse.

00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.600
Many studies have shown we
have a big shortage of nurses

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.740
coming up here.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.310
OK, so we've got some problems,
as you all know about.

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:34.140
So, basically, what
we say in health care

00:32:34.140 --> 00:32:35.430
is there's a value crisis.

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:37.710
Value is defined
as what you deliver

00:32:37.710 --> 00:32:39.930
and divided by what you pay for.

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:42.720
And roughly about
half the health care

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.870
we know how to deliver to
the patient gets delivered.

00:32:45.870 --> 00:32:50.610
And the cost, this is of GDP.

00:32:50.610 --> 00:32:54.155
In 2007, we were spending 16%
of our gross domestic product

00:32:54.155 --> 00:32:54.780
on health care.

00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:57.330
In 2050, it's
supposed to be 37%.

00:32:57.330 --> 00:33:01.260
That's just unsustainable
and the same with Medicare.

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:03.780
So we hope that
lean thinking can

00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:06.490
be one piece of a puzzle
of improving health care.

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.360
It's a complicated--
it's a complicated field.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:13.110
And there's no simple
solution, but lean can help.

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:15.000
OK, so those are
two industries as

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.250
to why they're applying lean.

00:33:16.250 --> 00:33:17.670
Now, let's talk a
little bit about what

00:33:17.670 --> 00:33:19.378
is an enterprise
because, in this course,

00:33:19.378 --> 00:33:22.840
we very much focus on applying
lean across an enterprise,

00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:27.010
not just a manufacturing
or a clinic thing.

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.980
So an enterprise
is broadly defined

00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:31.630
as one or more
organizations having

00:33:31.630 --> 00:33:34.060
related activities,
a unified operation,

00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:36.740
and a common business purpose.

00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.030
And so you might have, in
an engineering enterprise,

00:33:40.030 --> 00:33:44.360
customers, engineering
products, product development

00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:48.140
or engineering, manufacturing,
suppliers, finance, and so on

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.640
and support.

00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:53.740
And enterprises can
be pretty complex.

00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:57.040
So it's hard to define the
boundaries in an enterprise.

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:58.530
It's somewhat contextual.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:04.240
You might draw it around your
table here as an enterprise,

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.180
but most enterprises
have partners

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:11.580
that they have close
operating agreements with.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:16.429
And so we call the core
enterprise the organization

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:24.170
plus its most closely related
partners that work with them.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.540
And then, beyond that, there's
an extended enterprise,

00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:31.570
which is all their suppliers and
actually their customers too.

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:35.600
And also their community and
regulatory agencies and things

00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.929
like that all can
affect their enterprise.

00:34:38.929 --> 00:34:46.370
So a company like Boeing
has maybe 2,000 suppliers.

00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:47.989
And, by the way,
those 2,000 suppliers

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:51.290
are suppliers to
Airbus and Embraer.

00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:54.210
And so this gets
very complicated.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:57.660
OK, so who are the
stakeholders of an enterprise?

00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:59.400
They're any group
or individual who

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.230
can affect or is affected by
the organizational objective.

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:09.470
So you have your employees,
partners, suppliers, unions,

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.090
customers, shareholders.

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:13.460
These are all stakeholders
who can affect or are

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:16.440
affected by your enterprise.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.903
Jennifer, at Boston Medical
Center, do you have any--

00:35:19.903 --> 00:35:22.320
I don't know how long you've
been at Boston Medical Center

00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.030
and whether you--

00:35:25.565 --> 00:35:28.430
do any of these kind of
things resonate with you

00:35:28.430 --> 00:35:30.763
in terms of who your
stakeholders are there?

00:35:30.763 --> 00:35:31.430
What department?

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:31.970
You're in radiology?

00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:32.750
AUDIENCE: Radiology.

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:33.920
I've been there for five years.

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.630
So hopefully I know
a little bit about--

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.838
EARLL MURMAN: So you have
some suppliers of CAT scans

00:35:37.838 --> 00:35:38.963
and all this kind of stuff?

00:35:38.963 --> 00:35:39.770
AUDIENCE: Oh, sure.

00:35:39.770 --> 00:35:42.350
Sure, I mean, I was actually
thinking about the broader

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.520
sense in terms of how the
community health centers

00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:45.020
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:45.020 --> 00:35:47.420
So we, for instance,
serve the emergency room.

00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:48.430
We serve the inpatients.

00:35:48.430 --> 00:35:50.810
We serve our own
BMC outpatients.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:54.760
Then we also serve a very large
network of community health

00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:56.440
centers who send all
of their patients

00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:00.450
to us for imaging that
they can't provide.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:04.080
Then there's the technical
arena of all of the--

00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.010
GE provides most
of our equipment,

00:36:09.010 --> 00:36:11.070
but we have different
suppliers for our MRIs

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:12.630
and our CTs and our ultrasounds.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.820
Those are all
different corporations.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.857
And then they all have their
own technical support services.

00:36:17.857 --> 00:36:19.690
EARLL MURMAN: I think
you've made the point.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:20.315
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:20.315 --> 00:36:21.318
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:21.318 --> 00:36:23.360
EARLL MURMAN: So there
are a lot of stakeholders.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.990
And each of these stakeholders--

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:30.080
this is a very high-level
definition of value.

00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:31.730
We're going to come
in the next module

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:33.770
to a much more specific
definition of value.

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:36.810
This is a very high level, but
every one of these stakeholders

00:36:36.810 --> 00:36:38.670
expects some value
from the enterprise

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:43.070
just like Jennifer
just outlined.

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.920
And, in return, they're supposed
to contribute some value

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.810
to that enterprise.

00:36:47.810 --> 00:36:51.020
So there's kind of a
value proposition here.

00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:53.900
A value is how
various stakeholders

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:55.630
find worth, utility,
or a benefit

00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.980
or reward in exchange for
their respective contribution

00:36:57.980 --> 00:36:59.250
to the enterprise.

00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:02.360
So there's this kind
of value relationship

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.720
going on here in an enterprise.

00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:07.220
And now what's a
lean enterprise?

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.320
When we started
this work, we said

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:12.110
this is a lean enterprise
course or a lean enterprise

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:13.130
initiative.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:15.300
People said, well, what
is a lean enterprise?

00:37:15.300 --> 00:37:16.817
It turns out that's
a good question.

00:37:16.817 --> 00:37:17.900
And here's our definition.

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.410
It's an enterprise of--

00:37:19.410 --> 00:37:22.370
it's an integrated entity
that officially creates

00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:24.920
value for its
multiple stakeholders

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:27.020
by employing the principles
and practices we're

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:28.270
going to cover in this course.

00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.390
Now, these principles apply
across the entire enterprise.

00:37:34.390 --> 00:37:37.360
So, in an engineering
enterprise,

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:39.610
you have generally what's
called the product lifecycle

00:37:39.610 --> 00:37:44.820
from the initial concept
of a product like this

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.187
through the design,
definition, design, getting

00:37:48.187 --> 00:37:49.770
the supply chain
lined up, production,

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.100
and distribution of support.

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.060
That's what generates
money for the enterprise,

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.740
selling this product.

00:37:55.740 --> 00:38:01.870
But it also has finance,
information technology,

00:38:01.870 --> 00:38:04.850
human resources, various support
functions which are needed,

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:06.820
and the leadership processes.

00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.680
And the point is lean
applies to all these.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.685
It doesn't apply just
to manufacturing.

00:38:10.685 --> 00:38:12.310
It applies across
the whole enterprise.

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:15.313
And we'll show you an
example of that in a minute.

00:38:15.313 --> 00:38:16.980
In health care, it's
very much the same.

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:18.688
Instead of having the
product life cycle,

00:38:18.688 --> 00:38:21.310
you have the patient life cycle.

00:38:21.310 --> 00:38:23.950
So lean doesn't apply
just to treatment.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:28.090
It applies from
preventive monitoring

00:38:28.090 --> 00:38:30.070
through long-term
care management.

00:38:30.070 --> 00:38:31.695
We should really be
thinking-- in fact,

00:38:31.695 --> 00:38:34.195
there are people who feel that
the health care system should

00:38:34.195 --> 00:38:35.310
be reorganized along--

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:40.460
let's call them disease
pathways or something

00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:45.168
like that, instead of segmented
into imaging and so on.

00:38:45.168 --> 00:38:47.210
And again you have the
same supporting functions.

00:38:47.210 --> 00:38:49.970
And I'm really glad that a
couple of our students here

00:38:49.970 --> 00:38:53.150
in health care are
administrative fellows,

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.040
looking into health
care administration.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.860
That's really important.

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:00.410
OK, so does it work?

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:04.320
Well, I told you how
LAI got started in 1992.

00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:06.980
And it took us 10 years
to respond to the general

00:39:06.980 --> 00:39:08.540
with a book we wrote.

00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:11.180
And we said-- after 10 years,
we said to the general--

00:39:11.180 --> 00:39:14.390
by then, we'd been through
three or four generals.

00:39:14.390 --> 00:39:19.120
And we said, yes, lean does
apply to aerospace if we take

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.740
it at the enterprise level.

00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:22.930
If it's applied to all the
functions of aerospace,

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.820
not just to manufacturing.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:31.330
OK, here's a really good
example of the F-18 aircraft.

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:36.180
This is a fighter
aircraft for the Navy.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.190
They were going through
an upgrade to the model

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:40.990
E/F. It was an upgrade,
but it was actually

00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.090
a completely new aircraft.

00:39:42.090 --> 00:39:44.310
It was 25% bigger, but
it was sold to Congress

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:48.850
as an upgrade, $5 billion
budget, 8 and 1/2 years

00:39:48.850 --> 00:39:52.390
to do the engineering
and design.

00:39:52.390 --> 00:39:57.080
The program performed
on schedule within cost,

00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:59.990
met all its technical
requirements,

00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:02.510
very unusual compared to those
burning platform programs

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:03.320
I showed you.

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.230
And, when we went in and
studied it and looked

00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:08.930
at what they'd done with
what the lean principles are,

00:40:08.930 --> 00:40:10.643
they were a lean enterprise.

00:40:10.643 --> 00:40:12.560
They didn't call themselves
a lean enterprise,

00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.700
but they had done this.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:16.070
And, in fact, we went and
gave them this briefing.

00:40:16.070 --> 00:40:19.460
And we said to them, we've
concluded your lean enterprise.

00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:22.240
And they said,
whoa, no, we're not.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.220
We have so much more to do.

00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:26.380
Don't tell us we're
a lean enterprise.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:30.560
That's the attitude you
want, wonderful program.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.380
Here's a completely
different area, electronics,

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:34.190
Rockwell Collins.

00:40:34.190 --> 00:40:37.880
We're going to come back to
them on Thursday with a case

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:42.190
study of Rockwell Collins,
but they applied lean thinking

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:45.100
across their whole company
in the office environment,

00:40:45.100 --> 00:40:48.670
as well as in the factory,
and the great results.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.970
And we'll see data from them
on their operating performance

00:40:51.970 --> 00:40:52.930
tomorrow.

00:40:52.930 --> 00:40:55.700
Health care, many
examples in health care,

00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:59.680
Susan will give you a lot more
when she talks on Thursday,

00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:00.610
but just hear a few.

00:41:00.610 --> 00:41:03.490
There's a number
of books out now.

00:41:03.490 --> 00:41:05.920
ThedaCare in
Wisconsin, waiting time

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.420
from when you first
call to when you

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.540
get scheduled for orthopedic
surgery went from 14 weeks

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:13.570
to 31 hours.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:15.183
Here's a hospital
in Pennsylvania

00:41:15.183 --> 00:41:16.600
where they reduced
the readmission

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.140
rate for COPD patients.

00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:23.050
Children's Hospital in
Seattle reduced its capital

00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:26.410
expenditures by $180 million
by using lean improvements.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:28.990
And Susan mentioned
about architecture.

00:41:28.990 --> 00:41:32.740
That's becoming a big area for
saving in capital improvements.

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.230
And here's a
hospital in Nebraska

00:41:35.230 --> 00:41:38.320
where it reduced the time it
took to turn around the lab

00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:43.270
results over a
six-year period by 72%

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:48.540
by using the same people
and the same facilities.

00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:50.010
OK, here's the
New Balance story.

00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.980
We're going to see a
video on this shortly,

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:54.570
but they're a shoe company.

00:41:54.570 --> 00:41:57.060
They're the only company that
manufactures athletic shoes

00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.610
in the United States.

00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:03.777
OK, it used to take them eight
days to make a pair of shoes.

00:42:03.777 --> 00:42:04.860
Now, it takes three hours.

00:42:08.322 --> 00:42:10.280
They're actually doing
the same amount of work.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.203
So here they were only-- of
the eight days, only 2/10

00:42:13.203 --> 00:42:14.870
of a percent of the
time were they doing

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:18.250
anything useful on the shoe.

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:23.570
The number of items they have
to have in inventory went from--

00:42:23.570 --> 00:42:26.600
well, inventory
turn is the number

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.280
of times you turn
over the inventory.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:31.160
Here it took from 3.5 to 13.

00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.712
They can make a pair of shoes.

00:42:32.712 --> 00:42:34.670
They get a call saying
we need some more shoes.

00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:37.520
They can ship it in three days.

00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.840
Floor space reduced.

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:41.090
Production went up and so on.

00:42:41.090 --> 00:42:43.130
Let's just talk about this.

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:48.960
Kanban, Japanese word, who's
ever heard the word kanban?

00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.300
One, Catherine has heard kanban.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.460
Kind of a strange
word, isn't it?

00:42:53.460 --> 00:42:57.840
How many of you at home
keep a shopping list?

00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:00.150
OK, so tell me.

00:43:00.150 --> 00:43:03.360
How do you make your
shopping list, Whitney?

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:05.825
AUDIENCE: Like in
terms of which ones?

00:43:05.825 --> 00:43:07.450
Well, now, I use an
app for everything.

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:09.082
So I don't [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:09.082 --> 00:43:11.410
On the weekends,
we'll kind of pick

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.790
what things I'm going to do.

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.230
And it forms a list for me.

00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:16.350
So I carry it around
with me everywhere.

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.290
EARLL MURMAN: So how do you
make that list of things you--

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:20.958
well, let's say
grocery shopping, just

00:43:20.958 --> 00:43:21.750
to take an example.

00:43:21.750 --> 00:43:24.210
So grocery shopping, what
do you put on your list?

00:43:24.210 --> 00:43:27.210
AUDIENCE: I pick the recipes,
and it creates a list for me.

00:43:27.210 --> 00:43:28.260
EARLL MURMAN: OK, so
you pick what you need.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:28.885
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:28.885 --> 00:43:30.180
EARLL MURMAN: OK, anybody else?

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.433
How do you do your
shopping list, Tony?

00:43:32.433 --> 00:43:33.600
AUDIENCE: I go to my fridge.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:38.520
And I look at what is
missing I go to my cupboard

00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:40.058
and see if there
are things that are

00:43:40.058 --> 00:43:41.350
missing that I need to replace.

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.020
And I write down the list.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.700
EARLL MURMAN: So
he's got 5S working.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.158
He can look at his cupboard
and see he's missing something,

00:43:47.158 --> 00:43:47.700
right?

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:49.740
OK, you have some kind of
standardized way of storing

00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.550
things in your cupboard.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:51.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.320
EARLL MURMAN: OK, and you
spot what you're missing,

00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.200
and you put it on
your list again.

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.140
Those are kanbans.

00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:58.830
OK, kanban is nothing more
than a queuing system,

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:01.020
a visual system,
to indicate what

00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:03.750
material parts or
other information you

00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:07.272
need to keep going.

00:44:07.272 --> 00:44:08.980
In a factory environment,
typically, it's

00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:12.400
a card, a barcoded
card of some kind.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:19.390
And, at some station where
they're manufacturing something

00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:20.830
or, in a health
care environment,

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:25.860
where they need some supplies,
they need more of that.

00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.900
And so they make
a little system.

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:29.600
And then someone delivers it.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.590
OK, now, the
opposite is, instead

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:35.527
of deciding what
recipes you have

00:44:35.527 --> 00:44:37.610
and what you're going to
buy, you go to the store,

00:44:37.610 --> 00:44:39.110
and you say, oh,
this is on special.

00:44:39.110 --> 00:44:42.440
I'm going to load up on
whatever, hamburger or toilet

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.000
paper or ketchup.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.583
OK, what you're doing
is you're buying

00:44:45.583 --> 00:44:47.208
because you're getting
volume discount,

00:44:47.208 --> 00:44:48.350
but you may not need it.

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:50.420
So a kanban system
is one where you only

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:53.810
deliver what's needed to
whoever is doing the work.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:57.800
And there's some cue,
usually a visual cue.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.410
It can be a barcoded card.

00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:05.210
It could be a bin that's empty,
some space on the floor that I

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:07.100
need a new delivery there.

00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:10.100
In an engineering environment
or a work office environment,

00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:12.230
it might be an empty inbox.

00:45:12.230 --> 00:45:15.560
Also, an interesting
kanban I saw,

00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:20.210
this was a factory at McDonnell
Douglas in East St. Louis.

00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:22.850
And they have supplies,
something coming

00:45:22.850 --> 00:45:24.620
from a company in California.

00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:28.730
They make a packaging container
that this product went into.

00:45:28.730 --> 00:45:30.230
And so the company
is in California.

00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:31.730
The factory is in
East St. Louis.

00:45:31.730 --> 00:45:35.640
And on the ceiling is
a camera looking down

00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:38.922
at the number of these
boxes that are there.

00:45:38.922 --> 00:45:40.380
And, when the
company in California

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.560
sees they need more
boxes, they ship them.

00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.090
That's a kanban.

00:45:46.090 --> 00:45:51.350
So Toyota implemented kanban
in their production system.

00:45:51.350 --> 00:45:52.700
It took them 20 years.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:45:57.145
You wouldn't think it
would take that long.

00:45:57.145 --> 00:45:58.520
When they first
started doing it,

00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:00.145
they actually came
to the United States

00:46:00.145 --> 00:46:01.400
and saw the supermarkets.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:04.700
And, in the supermarket,
the potato chips,

00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.740
you buy potato chips, and
the shelf looks empty.

00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:08.315
So the potato chip
guy comes and sees

00:46:08.315 --> 00:46:09.440
you need more potato chips.

00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.793
That's where it came
from, supermarkets.

00:46:11.793 --> 00:46:12.710
So they introduced it.

00:46:12.710 --> 00:46:14.480
It took them 10 years after
they did the experiments

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.813
to make it across the whole
company and another 10 years

00:46:16.813 --> 00:46:18.830
to make it across
their suppliers.

00:46:18.830 --> 00:46:21.020
OK, and they continued
to work on it.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.160
So now think a little bit
about whatever enterprise

00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.530
you might think about.

00:46:24.530 --> 00:46:26.800
Get out your colored cards here.

00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:30.890
Think about where you've
had some experiences.

00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:33.650
How long do you think it
would take to implement lean

00:46:33.650 --> 00:46:34.980
in some environment?

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:41.060
You can think about your company
or your department at MIT.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.440
Think about lean thinking
in your department.

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:48.107
Think about your parents'
work environment.

00:46:48.107 --> 00:46:50.690
Just pick some work environment,
knowing that all the we could

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:51.800
teach you in three
days, how long

00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:54.403
do you think it might take to
implement lean in whatever work

00:46:54.403 --> 00:46:55.820
environment you're
thinking about?

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.140
And then hold up
the colored card

00:46:57.140 --> 00:46:58.265
when you make up your mind.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:03.260
OK, I don't see any blues.

00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:05.990
I see a lot of yellows,
a lot of greens.

00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:07.850
That's good, some reds.

00:47:07.850 --> 00:47:10.730
OK, so it's going to
take a little while.

00:47:10.730 --> 00:47:12.495
Maybe it looks like,
I'd say, the bulk

00:47:12.495 --> 00:47:14.370
of the numbers I have
up here are five years.

00:47:14.370 --> 00:47:17.690
Susan, you work with a lot
of health care organizations.

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:20.210
You said you've been
doing this for five years.

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:24.150
What kind of-- how long are you
seeing that a typical health

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:25.330
care organization--

00:47:25.330 --> 00:47:26.788
SUSAN SHEEHY: Most
of the hospitals

00:47:26.788 --> 00:47:29.310
we've worked with take at
least five years if not more

00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:30.810
because you really
have to spread it

00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.012
throughout the organization.

00:47:32.012 --> 00:47:32.970
And it takes that long.

00:47:32.970 --> 00:47:36.305
You can't just teach five
people and say, OK, we're lean.

00:47:36.305 --> 00:47:38.370
So it's at least five
years if not more.

00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:39.930
And that's with
an all-out effort.

00:47:39.930 --> 00:47:41.305
EARLL MURMAN: At
least five years

00:47:41.305 --> 00:47:45.660
with an all-out effort,
not a half-hearted effort.

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.390
OK, so this is a big
commitment for an organization

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:49.240
to implement lean.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:52.890
OK, they're not going to see
quarterly bottom-line profit

00:47:52.890 --> 00:47:55.050
changes, which their
shareholders may

00:47:55.050 --> 00:47:56.660
be looking for.

00:47:56.660 --> 00:47:59.870
What are some questions that
this introductory module

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:01.590
kind of brings up in your mind?

00:48:01.590 --> 00:48:04.910
Or do you have comments you'd
like to make or suggestions?

00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:06.500
Yeah, Jennifer.

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.780
AUDIENCE: For the
6S activity, if you

00:48:08.780 --> 00:48:11.930
had asked me to sort that
stuff from the very beginning,

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:14.780
I probably would have
ended up on the end page

00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:17.115
first with everything in--

00:48:17.115 --> 00:48:18.760
if you just said
sort these things,

00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.638
it would have been
super subselected,

00:48:20.638 --> 00:48:22.430
which might just be my
own personality when

00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:23.570
somebody says sort.

00:48:23.570 --> 00:48:27.230
So I'm a little unclear what
the difference between sort,

00:48:27.230 --> 00:48:30.280
standard, straighten,
and standardize

00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:31.113
are in that respect.

00:48:31.113 --> 00:48:32.655
EARLL MURMAN: That's
a good question.

00:48:32.655 --> 00:48:35.040
You know, I think the sort
one is, first of all, just

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:38.010
get rid of stuff that
shouldn't be there.

00:48:38.010 --> 00:48:41.910
And I have slides from a
lot of different examples

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:46.290
of storerooms that had totally
obsolete equipment in them.

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:48.990
And people were
spending lots of time

00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:50.953
looking for something
that was not

00:48:50.953 --> 00:48:52.120
all that obsolete equipment.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:53.910
So I think the sort
part is pretty quick.

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:56.820
Now, the straighten
and standardize I think

00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:00.240
might be done as a single step.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.330
But I'm not going to--

00:49:03.330 --> 00:49:04.350
I think you're fine.

00:49:04.350 --> 00:49:05.340
It's a good comment.

00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:07.860
But what's amazing
to me is how often

00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:10.493
an organization starts with 5S.

00:49:10.493 --> 00:49:11.910
I mean, you would
think, why isn't

00:49:11.910 --> 00:49:13.473
anybody doing it this way?

00:49:13.473 --> 00:49:14.640
SUSAN SHEEHY: It's because--

00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:16.098
and we hear this
term all the time.

00:49:16.098 --> 00:49:17.805
It's the way we've
always done it.

00:49:17.805 --> 00:49:18.930
That's what we always hear.

00:49:18.930 --> 00:49:20.388
Because it's the
way we've always--

00:49:20.388 --> 00:49:22.860
and workarounds
and do-overs have

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:24.160
been built into the system.

00:49:24.160 --> 00:49:27.360
So nobody even recognizes
that they're doing it.

00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.550
It just becomes part
of the daily work.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:30.600
EARLL MURMAN: Do you
have a question, Monica?

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.142
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was just wondering.

00:49:32.142 --> 00:49:34.540
You said that the average
time was five years.

00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:38.010
So I was just wondering, in our
culture of immediate response

00:49:38.010 --> 00:49:41.600
time and response to
crisis, how do you sustain

00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.020
an organization's interest--

00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.020
EARLL MURMAN: That's a--

00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.145
AUDIENCE: --for five years?

00:49:45.145 --> 00:49:48.620
EARLL MURMAN:
--really good question

00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:49.820
I'll answer what I can.

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:53.120
And Bo and Sue and
others can pipe in.

00:49:53.120 --> 00:49:55.550
First of all, you have to
have this so-called burning

00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:56.540
platform.

00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:58.430
That is there's sort
of no other option.

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:01.200
Either we do it, or
we go out of business.

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.870
So it's very hard
for an organization

00:50:02.870 --> 00:50:07.100
that's doing extremely well
to adopt something like this.

00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:12.995
Secondly, it takes leadership.

00:50:12.995 --> 00:50:18.013
It has to be that the
organizational leadership says,

00:50:18.013 --> 00:50:19.430
this is important,
and we're going

00:50:19.430 --> 00:50:22.390
to have constancy of
purpose and sustain this.

00:50:22.390 --> 00:50:25.077
We're going to start this
and do it and stay with it.

00:50:25.077 --> 00:50:27.160
And then, third, it has
to align with the strategy

00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.145
of the organization.

00:50:28.145 --> 00:50:30.770
That is it has to be built into
what the organization is trying

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:31.270
to do.

00:50:31.270 --> 00:50:32.690
It can't be something separate.

00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:33.950
We're trying to do
this, and, meanwhile,

00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:35.180
we're going to do lean.

00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:37.080
The two have to be together.

00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:42.157
And, frankly, many
organizations can't do it.

00:50:42.157 --> 00:50:43.740
SUSAN SHEEHY: I could
answer that too.

00:50:43.740 --> 00:50:46.540
It's also a series of
incremental changes.

00:50:46.540 --> 00:50:48.390
So, if something happens,
like a medication

00:50:48.390 --> 00:50:51.450
error that's disastrous, you
can certainly start with that.

00:50:51.450 --> 00:50:54.060
And, as you have
improvements, you

00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:57.660
celebrate those improvements
and distribute that information

00:50:57.660 --> 00:51:00.630
so that it's a
continuous improvement.

00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:03.750
And it can happen over time with
really good things happening

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:04.980
along the way.

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:08.470
But to roll it out to an entire
organization takes a long time.

00:51:08.470 --> 00:51:10.470
But we tell people we
have to start somewhere.

00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:13.290
And it's not like it's going to
alter your whole organization

00:51:13.290 --> 00:51:14.130
overnight.

00:51:14.130 --> 00:51:17.430
It's celebrating those
incremental things that you do,

00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:19.860
looking at your data,
looking at your outcomes,

00:51:19.860 --> 00:51:23.070
looking at your staff
turnover, and using

00:51:23.070 --> 00:51:25.420
that to build your lean program.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:29.145
So it takes time, but you can
celebrate things along the way.

00:51:29.145 --> 00:51:30.270
EARLL MURMAN: The biggest--

00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:35.440
I think the biggest
barrier to this

00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:38.230
is if there's a change in
the leadership at the top,

00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:41.000
and the new person doesn't
really understand it.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.820
And then the whole
thing can crash.

00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:45.480
Bo?

00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.272
BO MADSEN: I think, as
well, it's important

00:51:47.272 --> 00:51:50.040
that you have a vision, that
your organization has a vision,

00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.520
and that everybody knows
what that vision is.

00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:55.770
And then the beginning
is the hardest,

00:51:55.770 --> 00:52:00.660
but, in reality, we all
want to do value-added work.

00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.510
We want to do the work that
we're actually employed to do.

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:05.190
People, they enjoy that.

00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:09.600
When they can see with the
first steps that the waste

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:12.750
that we're sucked into every
day, that that goes away

00:52:12.750 --> 00:52:14.970
and you're more
productive, that's nice.

00:52:14.970 --> 00:52:17.230
People, they enjoy that.

00:52:17.230 --> 00:52:19.230
EARLL MURMAN: Good, what
are some questions that

00:52:19.230 --> 00:52:23.190
come from the
engineering folks here?

00:52:23.190 --> 00:52:24.727
Yeah?

00:52:24.727 --> 00:52:27.060
AUDIENCE: So, at some point,
you pointed out a disparity

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:31.380
between how many hours of
training both United States

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:34.460
and Japanese companies,
exactly, give to their workers.

00:52:34.460 --> 00:52:37.950
And this might be
silly, but it seems

00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:41.648
that the people are what pretty
much makes the company run.

00:52:41.648 --> 00:52:46.820
So, if they're spending so much
time training their workers

00:52:46.820 --> 00:52:49.800
and getting so much
profit off of it,

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:53.750
how are we not doing
the same thing?

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:55.270
EARLL MURMAN: So
is the question--

00:52:55.270 --> 00:52:57.157
is the question, does
the training detract

00:52:57.157 --> 00:52:58.490
from the productive [INAUDIBLE].

00:52:58.490 --> 00:53:00.940
AUDIENCE: No, my question is,
why aren't we investing more

00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.185
into training our workers?

00:53:02.185 --> 00:53:06.720
EARLL MURMAN: Oh yeah, so that's
been a real change in the US

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:09.300
companies as they've
adopted these

00:53:09.300 --> 00:53:11.760
is they've come to realize
the importance of training.

00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:14.670
And they do invest
a lot in training.

00:53:14.670 --> 00:53:17.130
A typical company that
I know of in the US

00:53:17.130 --> 00:53:19.800
will invest at least 40 hours
a week for every employee

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.810
to be trained during the year.

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:24.090
And training can be broad.

00:53:24.090 --> 00:53:26.280
It can be specific to
that particular job,

00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.830
but it could be much broader,
just communication skills

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:33.900
or sometimes even just
awareness about their culture

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:35.530
of the customers
in other countries.

00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:37.530
AUDIENCE: So do you think
that the difference is

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:42.773
not in training hours anymore,
but in the workers themselves?

00:53:42.773 --> 00:53:44.190
EARLL MURMAN: I
really don't know.

00:53:44.190 --> 00:53:45.030
I'm not sure I can answer that.

00:53:45.030 --> 00:53:46.410
I can say that they
are investing more

00:53:46.410 --> 00:53:47.350
in training hours.

00:53:47.350 --> 00:53:50.250
Whether it's because the workers
are different, I don't know.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:50.910
Yeah.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:53.337
There may be a chicken
and egg situation there.

00:53:53.337 --> 00:53:55.170
One question here, and
then we'll come back.

00:53:55.170 --> 00:53:59.250
AUDIENCE: OK, so you mentioned
that a lean enterprise creates

00:53:59.250 --> 00:54:01.210
value to multiple stakeholders.

00:54:01.210 --> 00:54:02.750
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:04.890
AUDIENCE: But what happens
if those values are not

00:54:04.890 --> 00:54:05.840
necessarily aligned?

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:07.007
EARLL MURMAN: Aligned.

00:54:07.007 --> 00:54:07.590
Good question.

00:54:07.590 --> 00:54:09.260
AUDIENCE: I'm
thinking, sometimes,

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:10.465
you have the shareholders.

00:54:10.465 --> 00:54:13.610
And they might be willing to
move the enterprise-- transform

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:15.610
the enterprise in one direction.

00:54:15.610 --> 00:54:17.630
And you can have the employees.

00:54:17.630 --> 00:54:19.550
They don't want
change because they're

00:54:19.550 --> 00:54:21.108
comfortable in that situation.

00:54:21.108 --> 00:54:21.650
I don't know.

00:54:21.650 --> 00:54:23.720
EARLL MURMAN: No,
it's a great question.

00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:24.519
Is it Matthias?

00:54:24.519 --> 00:54:25.144
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:25.144 --> 00:54:29.610
EARLL MURMAN: Matthias
asked is the shareholders

00:54:29.610 --> 00:54:31.635
values are not always--

00:54:31.635 --> 00:54:34.270
will normally not be
aligned completely.

00:54:34.270 --> 00:54:36.690
OK, so you have to
do the best you can.

00:54:36.690 --> 00:54:39.820
OK, I mean, you have
to find something.

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:41.820
I mean, the ideal is if
you could find something

00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:43.988
where every stakeholder
gains something.

00:54:43.988 --> 00:54:45.780
Maybe they don't gain
everything they want,

00:54:45.780 --> 00:54:46.780
but they gain something.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.570
Something is better than before.

00:54:48.570 --> 00:54:50.310
OK, so let me take
the employee thing.

00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:56.280
I think one of the--

00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:58.670
I think the question Monica
asked relates to that too.

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:02.820
One of the things
that-- one of the things

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:05.967
that successful organizations
do that implement lean is they

00:55:05.967 --> 00:55:07.800
make it known to their
employees that nobody

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:10.380
is going to lose their
job because of increase

00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:12.590
in productivity.

00:55:12.590 --> 00:55:14.850
So it's very hard if you
go into an organization

00:55:14.850 --> 00:55:17.698
and say, Emily, I want
you to help improve us.

00:55:17.698 --> 00:55:19.490
And, by the way, we
probably won't need you

00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:20.930
when we're finished.

00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:23.390
Your heart is not
going to be in that.

00:55:23.390 --> 00:55:27.390
So instead, you
say, Emily, we want

00:55:27.390 --> 00:55:29.373
to have a better organization.

00:55:29.373 --> 00:55:30.790
And you're going
to be part of it.

00:55:30.790 --> 00:55:32.970
You may not be doing the same
thing you were doing before.

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:34.887
We may have to train you
to do something else,

00:55:34.887 --> 00:55:37.140
or we may have to do something.

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:39.440
But you're valuable to
us, and we want you here.

00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:40.920
And we want you to
help us improve.

00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:43.710
So Emily is going to come out.

00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:45.290
She'll probably be
happier when she's

00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:47.040
done because she's
probably not completely

00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.538
satisfied with her job.

00:55:48.538 --> 00:55:49.830
And they'll be more productive.

00:55:49.830 --> 00:55:52.830
And maybe they'll end
up outsourcing stuff,

00:55:52.830 --> 00:55:55.960
but they'll find a place for
Emily in the organization.

00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:59.830
So you want to make sure it's
as much of a win-win as you can.

00:55:59.830 --> 00:56:00.900
And that's the challenge.

00:56:00.900 --> 00:56:07.130
I mean, sometimes, it's hard.

00:56:07.130 --> 00:56:10.790
And, unfortunately,
the short-term focus

00:56:10.790 --> 00:56:15.243
of our financial
system is a barrier

00:56:15.243 --> 00:56:16.910
for some of these
long-term commitments.

00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:19.890
So it takes a lot of strong
leadership to overcome that.

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:20.700
And I think Susan--

00:56:20.700 --> 00:56:21.200
good.

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.983
You want to show
incremental improvement.

00:56:23.983 --> 00:56:26.150
You want to try to get
better and better and better,

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:27.360
not [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.780
SUSAN SHEEHY: But I also think
that the equation in health

00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:33.290
care traditionally has been that
employees were on the expense

00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:35.310
side of the equation.

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:39.020
And so, when they needed to
cut costs, they cut positions.

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:41.780
And what Toyota does
is their employees

00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.310
are on the value
side of the equation.

00:56:44.310 --> 00:56:46.670
And so they value
those employees.

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:49.862
And that makes the difference
in the expense side as well.

00:56:49.862 --> 00:56:51.320
And I think that
makes a difference

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.980
because Toyota expects their
employees to make suggestions.

00:56:54.980 --> 00:56:56.545
And they implement
their suggestions

00:56:56.545 --> 00:56:57.920
where, in health
care, we haven't

00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.870
done a good job at doing that.

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:02.000
Employees were just employees.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.580
And now we're starting
to see that employees are

00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.960
the experts at what they do.

00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.710
And so we need to start
listening to them.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:09.740
And I have an example.

00:57:09.740 --> 00:57:12.530
I was doing work at a small
rural hospital in northern New

00:57:12.530 --> 00:57:14.570
England, a 50-bed hospital.

00:57:14.570 --> 00:57:18.140
And this class, I did
two classes of 16 people.

00:57:18.140 --> 00:57:21.650
And they were working on some
productivity kinds of issues.

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:24.510
And they came up with
$3 million in savings

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:28.870
from the delayed OR start times
and canceled imaging tests

00:57:28.870 --> 00:57:30.120
and all those kinds of things.

00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:32.930
And they really did a beautiful
job with their projects.

00:57:32.930 --> 00:57:36.080
And the last day at report
out, the CEO was there.

00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.080
He didn't hire us.

00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.450
It was a grant
through the state.

00:57:39.450 --> 00:57:42.030
So they did this report out and
talked about what they found.

00:57:42.030 --> 00:57:46.340
And, at the end, he said,
this really makes me look bad.

00:57:46.340 --> 00:57:47.580
And I said, excuse me.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:50.840
And he said, I should
have fixed these things.

00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:52.550
[INAUDIBLE]

00:57:52.550 --> 00:57:55.430
It was just-- it was the
old, traditional model

00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:56.480
of the hierarchy.

00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.550
I tell you what to
do, and you do it.

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:00.560
If I tell you to cut
10% off your budget,

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:04.130
you do it, not show me
how you can increase

00:58:04.130 --> 00:58:05.850
throughput and revenue.

00:58:05.850 --> 00:58:08.430
So we need to just change
our thinking in health care.

00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:10.970
And it's happening,
but very slowly.

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:14.030
And valuing the employee
is the most important thing

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:15.350
we need to do.

00:58:15.350 --> 00:58:17.690
And, unfortunately,
the term lean

00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:20.090
gives people the
absolute fear that we're

00:58:20.090 --> 00:58:21.590
going to cut positions.

00:58:21.590 --> 00:58:23.240
That's what they
immediately think

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.800
when you say we're coming
in to do lean, that word.

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.800
EARLL MURMAN: Do that,
and lean became the word.

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.220
It's like the--

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:29.137
SUSAN SHEEHY: Exactly.

00:58:29.137 --> 00:58:31.040
EARLL MURMAN: It's
like the evolution

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.150
of industry I showed you.

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:33.530
We can't change the word now.

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:34.790
It's just become part of it.

00:58:34.790 --> 00:58:36.248
SUSAN SHEEHY: It's
just what it is.

00:58:36.248 --> 00:58:38.840
EARLL MURMAN: It came actually
from a MIT graduate student

00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.820
in a research
seminar one day when

00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.710
they were talking
about the things they

00:58:42.710 --> 00:58:46.340
were learning about the
Japanese automotive industry.

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.360
And they said, what are
we going to call this?

00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:50.120
And he said, well, let's call
it lean because we're doing

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:51.650
more with less, and it stuck.

00:58:51.650 --> 00:58:53.960
But it unfortunately has
a negative sound to it,

00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:55.767
lean and mean and all
that kind of stuff.

00:58:55.767 --> 00:58:57.350
So we have time for
one more question.

00:58:57.350 --> 00:58:58.845
Did you have a question?

00:58:58.845 --> 00:59:01.220
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I'm going
to play the skeptical a bit.

00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:06.380
How do you establish causation
between these methods

00:59:06.380 --> 00:59:07.580
and the outcome?

00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:09.500
How is it not just
an improvement

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:10.870
in employee mentality?

00:59:10.870 --> 00:59:14.067
I want to have this company
that won't just sit back and--

00:59:14.067 --> 00:59:15.900
EARLL MURMAN: That's a
really good question.

00:59:15.900 --> 00:59:18.110
How can we show that the
kind of results we showed

00:59:18.110 --> 00:59:19.617
here come from lean?

00:59:19.617 --> 00:59:21.950
Because there are a lot of
confounding factors going on.

00:59:21.950 --> 00:59:23.617
There's a changing
business environment.

00:59:23.617 --> 00:59:25.310
There may be other
things going on.

00:59:25.310 --> 00:59:30.200
And I guess, in a
scientific sense,

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.290
it might be very
hard to do that.

00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:36.570
But, when you go and look at
organization after organization

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:39.810
after organization that adopts
this and sees improvement,

00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:43.410
there's a correlation there
that adopting lean thinking

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:46.170
and the way we teach it here--

00:59:46.170 --> 00:59:49.210
one of the pitfalls in
adopting lean thinking is--

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:51.400
and let's take the 5S or 6S.

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:54.210
A lot of people
think lean is a tool.

00:59:54.210 --> 00:59:55.840
Oh OK, now, I know how to do 5S.

00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:56.510
I can fix it.

00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:57.510
That's not what lean is.

00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:00.380
Lean is this change in culture
and the way of thinking

01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.450
that Susan mentioned.

01:00:01.450 --> 01:00:04.350
And that takes some time.

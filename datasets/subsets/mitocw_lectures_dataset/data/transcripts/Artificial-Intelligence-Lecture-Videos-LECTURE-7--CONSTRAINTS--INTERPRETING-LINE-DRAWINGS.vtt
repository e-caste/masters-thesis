00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.660
PATRICK WINSTON: Many of you,
maybe most of you, will never

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.850
have to work another search
problem by hand in your

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.510
natural life.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.870
Others will want to
take another run

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.100
at it on the final.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.030
I've been much criticized
for this way of doing

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.000
grading in the class.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.490
But the way I look at it is that
the relationship between

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:34.330
students and instructors ought
to be less adversarial than it

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.910
used to be in the good old days
when I was a student.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.100
I especially remember an
examination we took--

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.450
all of us took-- on Rayleigh
scattering.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.670
That was 803, I think.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.720
And back in the old days, we
had to take four physics

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.640
courses, not just two.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.100
And we had to take four math
courses, not just two.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.830
Back in the days when--

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.450
well, I was going to
say men were men.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.130
But most of us were
men in those days.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.110
I think we only had 20
women in our class.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.950
Anyway, we had a quiz on
Rayleigh scattering.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.910
And I thought, well, this
is pretty hard.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.789
And then I got my quiz back.

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:19.370
26.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:22.730
I thought, well, I've
been found out.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.030
I'm going to flunk out.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.350
My father will make me
go to law school.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.810
I'll never attract
anyone to marry.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.479
Horrible things will happen.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.884
Then the instructor announced
the class average was 18.

00:01:36.884 --> 00:01:39.220
I was two standard deviations
above that.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.420
They gave us the same exam
two weeks later,

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.030
and accounts vary.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.340
Some people say that the class
average went down.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.720
Anyway, today we're going
to study some stuff.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.780
We're going to study some
stuff that will make it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.230
possible for you to understand
how you can do that

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.990
computation in just a couple
of seconds, even with the

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.610
delays introduced by
the redrawing.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.660
Now this particular program--

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.970
I'm not real sure and I don't
have a proof, but I think it

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.530
will take more than the lifetime
of the universe to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.910
find a legitimate coloring of
the continental United States.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.860
But by the end of the next
class, you'll see how to do

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.820
that lickety-split in just
couple of seconds, even with

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.579
the re-display delays.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.590
Now we could, of course,
do this in two ways.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.950
One way is I could start off
by saying, let C be a

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.490
constraint satisfaction
problem and just

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.170
give you the result.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.950
And anybody can do that.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.406
That's great.

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:53.030
And you needed to learn
some stuff that way.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.740
But there are some things that
you needed to learn, I think,

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.630
a different way.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.100
And that different way involves
my telling you the

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.750
story of how it all
came to be.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.440
This is a new field, pretty
much, and therefore I know

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.730
most of the people in it.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.730
And I know all of the people
who did the work that I'm

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.720
going to tell you about today.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.220
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about the struggle for

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:23.160
coming up with the ideas that
led to one of the most

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.130
powerful methods you'll learn
about in the subject.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.670
It all has to do, originally,
with an attempt to make a

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.832
computer capable of seeing.

00:03:31.832 --> 00:03:33.890
And everybody said to
themselves, well, let's start

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.280
with seeing simple things,
like children's blocks.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.040
And so Adolfo Guzman, a graduate
student of Marvin

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.480
Minsky's, was charged with the
summer project, which led to

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.590
his Ph.D. thesis, of writing a
program that could look at a

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.440
line drawing and determine
how many objects

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.730
are in the line drawing.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:04:00.870
So for example, there behind my
outline is a line drawing.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.400
And you believe instantly that
there are two objects there,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.690
even though in some deep
sense, it's ambiguous.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.540
There are all sorts of ways
that you could, through

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.579
trickery, arrange something with
even seven objects that

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.709
look that way.

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.269
But most people would say
there are two objects.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.350
So Guzman set about the
problem of figuring

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.650
out how to do that.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.860
And then his work was followed
by Dave Huffman.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.440
And his work was followed
up by Dave Waltz.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.850
And his work was followed up by
Jane [? Froyter ?], who's

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:33.880
not listed there quite yet.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.580
And I want to tell you a little
bit of story how that

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.510
all happened.

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.440
So Guzman took a lot
of pictures.

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.870
He went to Boston Baby, the
precursor to Toys R Us,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:51.990
purchased a large block set on
a government contract, and

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.640
went about the business of
taking a lot of pictures of

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.390
them so he'd get a feel
for the domain.

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:00.370
And eventually he decided that
he could build a program that

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.910
could determine that there are
two objects here by using the

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:10.800
lines as a quanta of evidence
about which faces belong

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.090
together in an object.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.870
So he said, after studying these
for a long time, that

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.060
these drawings tend to have a
lot of arrow-type junctions

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.460
and a lot of fork-type
junctions.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.980
And when you see an arrow, it's
a little bit of evidence

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.490
that the objects on either
side of the shaft are the

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:30.010
same-- the face on either side
of the shaft belong to the

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:31.880
same object.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.590
And over here, the fork-type
junction suggests that

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:40.590
pairwise, three pairs
of faces seem to

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.909
belong to the same object.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.659
So with that idea, he could come
back to a drawing like

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:49.570
this and start decorating it
with these so-called links,

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:53.090
these quanta of evidence
that faces

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:54.340
belong to the same object.

00:06:00.408 --> 00:06:02.200
And if I've done it right,
you get something

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.230
that looks like so.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.650
It's a little hard to
see what's going on

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:07.920
on the drawing itself.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.170
So let me number these.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.180
Now I have an
easier-to-deal-with picture.

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.080
There are two links between
1 and 2 and 1 and 3.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.890
One link between 2 and 3.

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:39.820
One between 2 and 4.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.470
Two here.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.120
Two here.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.700
And one each from
all of these.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.760
So Guzman produces this evidence
for how the problem

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.960
ought to be solved and then he
begins to think about various

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:55.050
ways of using the evidence.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:07:01.830
So he could, and did, decide
that one link is enough to

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:04.720
presume that the faces belong
to the same object.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.730
And you can see that that's
a little bit too liberal.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.840
Because that says
that the whole

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.710
thing is just one object.

00:07:11.710 --> 00:07:17.695
So Guzman rejected the one-link
theory and went to

00:07:17.695 --> 00:07:18.945
the two-link theory.

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:27.110
And the two-link theory says,
oh, well, let's see.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:30.390
If we insist that two links
should be there before we are

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:35.909
willing to decide that it's the
same object, then these

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:39.090
three faces are pulled together
into one object.

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:41.790
These three are pulled together
into one object.

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.409
But alas, 7 doesn't share two
links with anything, so it's

00:07:44.409 --> 00:07:46.830
left dangling out there.

00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:50.990
So plainly, the two-link theory
is too conservative.

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.110
So that as you would soon
discover in any [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:57.030
project, would lead you to a
third theory, which is two

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:01.960
lengths repeated.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:07.430
So now that we've formed these
super regions, we can come

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:11.270
back and say we'll merge super
regions if they're connected

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:14.130
together by two or more links.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:16.240
So nothing new happens
up here.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:19.440
But this super region
is joined at 7

00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:21.440
by two or more links.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.270
So it pulls everything
together like so.

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:26.480
So that worked fine.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:27.480
Well, it didn't work fine.

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.620
There were lots of examples
of situations

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:32.850
where it didn't work--

00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:36.230
in situations that were
considered nonsensical by us

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:41.620
humans because it seemed silly,
the kind of conclusions

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.770
that it reached.

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.870
So when Guzman presented this
work in his Ph.D. thesis

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:52.830
defense, it's said--

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:54.770
and who knows if it's true--
but it's said that Marvin

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.630
Minsky thought it was
great work and we

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.250
should make him a professor.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.070
It happens that Dave Huffman was
also on the committee and

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:07.440
said that it was ad hoc and the
thesis should be rejected.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.580
So we had two polar opposites
of impressions there.

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:11.920
Dave Huffman, by the way--

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.160
you've heard that name
before, I imagine.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.830
It's the guy who invented
Huffman coating as a term

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.720
paper in a information theory
course taught by Bob Fano.

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.970
He got an A, they say.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.840
So Huffman didn't like it.

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.860
He thought it was a little
bit too ad hoc.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.430
It was too heuristic.

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:33.365
It didn't take advantage
of anything we

00:09:33.365 --> 00:09:35.120
might know about physics.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:37.500
And so people began to say,
well, why does it work?

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.570
And when does it not work?

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:42.130
And that's just about the best
question you can answer in a

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.832
situation like this.

00:09:43.832 --> 00:09:48.300
And by playing with some more
of Guzman's pictures and

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.870
reflecting on them, it turned
out that it worked because the

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:53.670
world is full of three-face
junctions.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.180
Or let me say three-face
vertexes because they're out

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.940
there in the world.

00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:06.950
We'll reserve the word junction
for something else.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:12.540
And three-face vertexes
generally project into either

00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:16.430
an arrow or a fork.

00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:21.410
So Guzman's whole program worked
on the weak backward

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.700
conclusion that if you see one
of those, it probably came

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.890
from one of these.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.320
So this is in the drawing.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.160
That's in the world.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:32.130
So by a process that's neither
deduction or induction, but

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.410
rather abduction, you see
one of those guys.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:38.840
And you say, well, they often
come from three-face vertexes

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.610
in the world, so if you see one,
it probably came from a

00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:42.670
three-face vertex
in the world.

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.520
That's abduction.

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:51.670
So once Huffman saw all that,
being a mathematician, he

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:55.135
began to think about how one
might develop a different and

00:10:55.135 --> 00:10:56.430
better theory.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:02.510
But we have to recognize that
all this work started off with

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.496
the efforts of Guzman, who
was an experimentalist.

00:11:13.610 --> 00:11:16.775
And Huffman was a
mathematician.

00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:25.520
So naturally, they approached
the problem differently.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.140
So Huffman says, I'm not going
to concern myself too much

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:32.600
with the actual problem that
Guzman was trying to solve.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.750
Rather, I'm going to work in a
very simple world, which I can

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:38.390
deal with mathematically.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.560
So he decided that he was going
to work in a world which

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.490
had several characteristics.

00:11:44.490 --> 00:11:47.760
Characteristic number one was
that the world would be

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.550
presented in general position.

00:11:58.969 --> 00:12:02.190
That is to say, no
screw cases.

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.920
So if you see a cube, it's
going to look like this.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:14.540
And it's not going to
look like this.

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.970
So that's out.

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:17.360
And this is in.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:19.550
And the idea here is that that's
not general position,

00:12:19.550 --> 00:12:21.930
because if you perturb your
point of view a little bit,

00:12:21.930 --> 00:12:23.340
you'll change those T junctions

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.810
into forks and arrows.

00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:27.430
So we know it had to deal
with those kinds of

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:31.210
weird kinds of cases.

00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:34.820
So that's presumption
number one.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:38.760
Presumption number two is that
we're going to be dealing with

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.010
a world that's trihedral.

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:49.080
That means all vertexes out
there are going to be formed

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.330
from three planes.

00:12:52.770 --> 00:12:55.720
So you're going to have the
intersection of three planes.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.840
So how many kinds of junctions
can you see if the world is

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:04.040
composed that way is the
question that Huffman sent

00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.225
himself upon.

00:13:06.225 --> 00:13:10.990
The next assumption was that
there are going to be four

00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.840
kinds of lines.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.820
See, Guzman only recognized
two kinds of lines-- lines

00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.350
that have a length and lines
that don't have a link.

00:13:17.350 --> 00:13:20.160
And they don't have very much to
do with the physical world.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.060
So Huffman says, I want to get
the constraint out of the

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.610
physical world.

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:26.590
So I'm going to deal with
four kinds of lines--

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:34.660
concave, convex, and boundary.

00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:46.030
So each of those kinds
of lines is going to

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.240
have its own notation.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:52.080
We'll call the convex lines
plus, the concave lines minus,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.600
and a boundary lines are going
to get an arrow on them,

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.330
depending on which side
of the object--

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.510
which side you would see the
object if you walk along the

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.364
direction of this
little arrow.

00:14:05.364 --> 00:14:06.614
STUDENT: Question.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.684
Which is concave and
which is convex?

00:14:12.684 --> 00:14:14.636
You said something and you
wrote the opposite.

00:14:14.636 --> 00:14:15.612
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, sorry.

00:14:15.612 --> 00:14:18.060
Thank you.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:19.480
So concave, convex,
and boundary.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:20.270
Thank you.

00:14:20.270 --> 00:14:23.345
So this down here, that's
a concave line.

00:14:23.345 --> 00:14:26.550
And that would get
a minus label.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.190
Oh, I don't know.

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:31.290
These lines you're seeing here,
if there were stuff

00:14:31.290 --> 00:14:33.440
behind them instead of
me, then all those

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.960
would be convex lines.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.220
Many times you see
a boundary line.

00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:41.720
For example, now you don't see
both sides of that line down

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:42.370
here at the bottom.

00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:43.750
So that's a boundary line.

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.250
And the arrow would point in
that direction, so as to keep

00:14:46.250 --> 00:14:49.330
the stuff of the object on the
right as you walk along a kind

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:52.160
of mathematical convention.

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.710
So three kinds of lines,
four kinds of labels.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:56.620
And there's some things
left out.

00:14:56.620 --> 00:14:59.860
That's because Huffman wanted
to keep his problem simple,

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.690
something he could
manage by hand.

00:15:01.690 --> 00:15:02.780
What's left out?

00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:04.060
Cracks are left out.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.160
Shadows are left out.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:10.750
There's a presumption that
there's nothing of interest

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:12.000
here with respect to that.

00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:20.260
So let's have a little
vocabulary before I go on.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:21.560
And I'll try to stick to it.

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.100
But there's the stuff out there,
and that consists of

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:29.540
vertexes and edges.

00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:35.700
And over here, on the
blackboard, we'll have

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:42.950
junctions and lines.

00:15:42.950 --> 00:15:44.490
And I'll try to stick
to that vocabulary.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:44.870
All right?

00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:45.660
Yes, Christopher?

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.590
STUDENT: Didn't you say there
were four types of lines?

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.630
PATRICK WINSTON: Yeah, there
are four kinds of--

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.940
the question is, didn't
I say there were

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:51.840
four kinds of lines?

00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.860
There are three kinds of lines,
but since we can label

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.100
a boundary line in
either direction,

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:55.980
we have four labels.

00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:58.010
OK?

00:15:58.010 --> 00:16:01.210
It depends on which side of the
object the stuff is on.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.765
And that will be clear,
I think, as

00:16:02.765 --> 00:16:05.670
soon as I do an example.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:08.650
So one, two, three
assumptions.

00:16:08.650 --> 00:16:11.170
A little bit of vocabulary.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:16.280
So we have the possibility of
making a complete catalog.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.220
This is so simple.

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:20.200
We have the possibility of
making a complete catalog of

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.510
all the ways that lines can
come together to form a

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:26.576
junction with respect to
these four labels.

00:16:26.576 --> 00:16:31.730
Now at first you might say, oh
my god, that will take a

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.230
couple of years.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:36.380
But maybe it won't take
a couple of years.

00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:43.320
And in the end, to perhaps your
surprise, you discover

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:47.660
that there are only 18 ways to
arrange the labels around a

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:49.760
junction in this world.

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.220
Everything else is excluded.

00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:54.040
If you have something that's not
in the set we're going to

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:58.930
produce now, it can't be built
with trihedral vertexes.

00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:10.400
So I've listed up there six L's,
five forks, four T's, and

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.650
three arrows.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:16.319
Let's see if I can figure out
why there are those 18 and

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:17.569
nothing else.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:25.300
Well, if we have three vertexes
coming together, that

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:28.010
means there are eight
octants, right?

00:17:28.010 --> 00:17:32.840
And the stuff of the object may
fill 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:35.030
or all eight octants.

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:36.450
Now of course, if you
fill all eight

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:37.330
octants, there's no junction.

00:17:37.330 --> 00:17:40.250
So we don't consider
that case.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:43.080
If we don't fill any the
octants, there's no junction.

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:43.890
There's no vertex.

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:46.540
So we don't consider
that case.

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.080
But if just one of the eight
octants is filled with stuff,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.130
then we can look at
it from any of the

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:55.760
seven remaining octants.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.360
So right now, you're looking
at it from one of the seven

00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.880
remaining octants.

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.750
And if I'm not mistaken,
you're going to see a

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:05.800
fork-style junction
there, right?

00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:07.600
And you're going to see a
fork-style junction in which

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:09.905
all of the edges are convex.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.850
An unfortunate selection of
names, because the linguists

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.600
tell me that we index
all of our words

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.500
by the first forename.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:21.210
And those have the same
first forename, so

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.840
they're easily confused.

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.830
So here's a fork-style
junction.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.160
And we know that one way that's
legitimate for the

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.050
lines to come in is
with four pluses.

00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:35.120
Now that's not the only
way you can see that.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:37.170
And here's another way.

00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:39.200
There's an L-style
junction, right?

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.650
And both of those are
boundary lines.

00:18:41.650 --> 00:18:45.810
And we want to draw the boundary
line indicators on

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:49.550
there so that if we walk along
the arrows, the stuff of the

00:18:49.550 --> 00:18:52.180
object would be on the right.

00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.730
So I suppose, to make it easier
to me do my drawing, I

00:18:54.730 --> 00:18:56.520
should look at it this way.

00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.650
And then I would say, well, that
has to be a legitimate

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:03.350
way of labeling a junction.

00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:05.160
Are there any more?

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.230
Well, there's seven altogether,
but many of them

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.760
are the same.

00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:12.010
There is one more that's a
little different, though.

00:19:12.010 --> 00:19:14.470
I can hold this guy
up like so.

00:19:14.470 --> 00:19:17.070
And if I'm holding at the right
angle for you, you see

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:19.020
an arrow-style junction,
right?

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:21.275
Two boundaries, and the
barb is convex.

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:27.143
So in this particular
case, I've got that.

00:19:27.143 --> 00:19:28.365
I've got that.

00:19:28.365 --> 00:19:31.840
And I've got a plus there.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:34.350
And that's there happen to be
for the one octant filled with

00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.100
stuff case.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:37.890
I happen to be able to
reverse this, though.

00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.200
And here's the seven octants
filled case.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.940
So that tells us that it's
possible to have a vertex out

00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:48.340
there in a space that when
reduced to a junction on the

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.760
board deserves three minus
labels, because all of these

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.680
that you're seeing
now are concave.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:20:00.920
So another fork-style junction
looks like so.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:06.210
And since there's only one
octant to look at from, that

00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:11.280
completes our analysis of the
seven octants filled case.

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.360
Now we have a couple of other
possibilities here.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:16.440
We might have five octants
filled with stuff.

00:20:22.770 --> 00:20:27.420
So that means there are three
octants that we can look from.

00:20:27.420 --> 00:20:29.030
So let's suppose that
these little chalk

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:32.860
pieces are little people.

00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:38.580
And they're looking at this
junction down there, where

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.930
this white object is fused
with the table.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.760
I'm fusing it with the table
because I want to consider it

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:45.100
to be one object.

00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.280
We can view it from the three
objects indicated by those

00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:49.190
three little chalk pieces.

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:52.580
And ask ourselves, well, in the
event that we look at it

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.110
from those three places,
what do we see?

00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:59.000
And if we look at it from the
perspective of the piece of

00:20:59.000 --> 00:20:59.780
purple chalk--

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.610
I'll have to walk around
and be sure--

00:21:01.610 --> 00:21:03.960
looks like an arrow
junction with two

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.575
concaves and a convex.

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:10.270
Did I get that right?

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:14.080
So I'm looking at it from
this perspective.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:15.210
It's an arrow.

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.460
This is convex and these two
are concave because I fused

00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:22.350
the paper box with the table.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.840
Looking at it from the
perspective of this blue guy--

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.580
let me rotate it so you can have
a better understanding of

00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:28.610
the blue guy--

00:21:28.610 --> 00:21:32.250
it looks like a concave
line and a boundary.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:36.750
So it's an L. And this
one is a boundary.

00:21:36.750 --> 00:21:38.400
And that's concave.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:41.710
And by a kind of symmetry, we're
also going to get that

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:46.250
one from the other side, the
third of the three octants.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:47.300
Well, we're off and running.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:50.660
But we still have an
awful lot to go.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:56.760
And we could manage to deal with
it by thinking about this

00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:59.640
object once again.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:06.290
But instead of this situation
out here, to turn it around

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.310
and look at this vertex.

00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:11.580
Think about the junctions
that it can produce.

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:12.860
I think I'll do that for you.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:14.610
Because you really have to play
with this and move it

00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:19.000
around a little bit to see how
things are going to look.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.480
So let me think about how that's
going to work out.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.150
I know that one of the
possibilities is going

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:29.480
to look like so.

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.830
I might as well not hide
that from you.

00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:34.080
It's going to be what happens
when there's a little man

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.770
looking up at the junction.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:39.720
And this one's going
to be minus.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.954
And now we've got two more
that are just like that.

00:22:43.954 --> 00:22:45.204
Look like so.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:52.270
And you say, oops.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:04.230
You say, aren't those
just a rotational

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.780
variance of each other?

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.530
And the answer is sure.

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:11.280
I write them all down, because
if you get a fork-style

00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.870
junction in space, there are
three different ways it could

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:14.300
be labeled.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.640
Depending on which of
the lines you put

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.160
the minus label on.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.920
So that takes care of that.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.310
And then there's one more of
these fork-style junctions.

00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:36.200
And that's plus, plus, minus
that derives from this case.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.150
And there appear to
be three more of

00:23:39.150 --> 00:23:41.120
these L-style junctions.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:50.280
And they look like, let's
see, plus, then plus.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.860
I'm having to think this
through as I go.

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.110
And then--

00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:00.490
and that's it.

00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:01.980
Well, what about the T's?

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:05.420
Well, in this world, the only
way you can get a T is if some

00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.605
object is obscuring
another object.

00:24:07.605 --> 00:24:10.050
And if an object is obscuring
a line, it can

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:12.130
be any line at all.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:15.980
So that's why the four remaining
ones are easy beyond

00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:19.470
description to label.

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:22.820
And of course, the cross
pieces of the T are all

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.930
boundary lines, with the
obscuring object on the right.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.520
Now let's see.

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:37.110
We've taken care now of the one,
three, five, and seven

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.480
octants filled cases.

00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.060
What about two, four, and six?

00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:46.480
Well, it turns out you can have
vertexes that are made

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:47.930
that way too.

00:24:47.930 --> 00:24:50.180
But they will have more
than three faces.

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.730
They'll have six faces.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:57.255
They'll be like what happens
when an object comes together

00:24:57.255 --> 00:24:58.505
at a point, like so.

00:25:01.308 --> 00:25:02.760
Like that.

00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:04.500
You can play with it a little
bit and see that if you have

00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.090
two, four, or six objects filled
with stuff, there are

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:08.010
more than three faces.

00:25:08.010 --> 00:25:09.690
So we're going to
ignore those.

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:16.040
So our constraint is going to
be a little more severe than

00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.640
would be suggested by the
terminology Huffman uses.

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:20.850
They're going to be trihedral
all right, but they're also

00:25:20.850 --> 00:25:22.100
going to be three faces.

00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:26.830
So we went to a lot
of work there.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:27.670
But what have we discovered?

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:31.120
We've discovered that in this
world, this is a complete,

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:33.970
100% percent, nothing excluded,
nothing else can be

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:38.680
there, catalog of all possible
ways the junctions can have

00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.770
line labels arranged
around them.

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:44.010
There's nothing else
in this world.

00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:46.970
So that's a very powerful
constraint.

00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:48.620
So now let's see what
we can do with it.

00:25:53.770 --> 00:25:56.340
This example is usually more fun
when the Red Sox are doing

00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.340
better, but they're not.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.870
Yet we'll use it any way.

00:25:59.870 --> 00:26:01.870
We're going to start
with an object that

00:26:01.870 --> 00:26:03.120
looks like home plate.

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.900
And I'll ask you the question.

00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.210
Can you build one of those?

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.940
I don't know.

00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:20.640
Let's give it a shot.

00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.790
We're going to assume that
this object is hanging,

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.250
floating in space.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.130
So therefore, all of these lines
around the boundary are

00:26:28.130 --> 00:26:31.490
boundary lines, like so.

00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:34.140
Now that gets us off to a good--
it's just hanging in

00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.040
space, Christopher, all right?

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:35.570
You look confused.

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:38.230
It's just hanging in space so
that all the lines around the

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:45.770
edges are places where you see
only one side has stuff on it.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:49.650
So that enables us to just
quickly run around the

00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:54.210
periphery and put arrow labels
on all those outside lines.

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.690
Now we have a lot
of arrow-style

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.020
junctions on the boundary.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.340
That's commonly the case.

00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.900
So we can run over to our
catalog of all possible

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:07.410
labels, and we see that if we
have an arrow with boundaries

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:10.490
on its barbs, there's
only one of those.

00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:14.790
So I know instantly that there
must be a plus on the shaft.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:18.070
So we can come back here and
take all these arrows here.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:22.310
And label them with plus
lines on their shafts.

00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:25.810
Now a line can't change its
nature along its length.

00:27:25.810 --> 00:27:28.390
So if it's a plus line on one
end, it's going to be a plus

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:29.705
line on the other end.

00:27:29.705 --> 00:27:32.970
All right?

00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:34.220
So what else can we do?

00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.840
Here deep inside is a
fork-style junction.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:43.840
It's got convex markers on
both of those two lines.

00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:47.130
So we go over to our catalog and
say, what can we say about

00:27:47.130 --> 00:27:50.660
it, given that there are pluses
on two of its lines?

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:52.230
Whoop, that means that
the third one has to

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:53.480
be a plus as well.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:58.390
And now we're done.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.370
We've labeled everything.

00:27:59.370 --> 00:28:00.830
Except--

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:02.540
look at this.

00:28:02.540 --> 00:28:05.930
What about that guy?

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.140
There's an L-style junction
with pluses on

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:10.240
both of its two lines.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.020
Is there one of those
in my catalog?

00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:14.280
No.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.180
Therefore, I haven't passed
a necessary condition for

00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:21.020
constructability in the
world that I've made.

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.080
You can't make it.

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.330
You can't construct it.

00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:30.470
So Huffman's ideas give us a
way of testing something to

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:35.600
see if it's not possible for
it to be in this world.

00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:45.200
If it passes the test, does
that mean it's possible?

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:45.740
No.

00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:48.740
It's a necessary but not
sufficient condition.

00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.730
On this one--

00:28:51.730 --> 00:28:53.580
blue-collar occupation--

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.910
on this one, maybe it
will help if we

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:58.060
put in another line.

00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.100
For example, we could
put a line like so.

00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.760
You feel better about it now?

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.530
I don't know.

00:29:04.530 --> 00:29:06.290
Let's see.

00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:09.390
This has to be a plus for the
same argument we used on

00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.200
several other arrows before.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:15.120
That gives us an arrow-style
junction here with a plus on

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.140
everything.

00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:20.298
Is there such a junction
label?

00:29:20.298 --> 00:29:21.510
No.

00:29:21.510 --> 00:29:22.445
We lose.

00:29:22.445 --> 00:29:23.670
It doesn't help.

00:29:23.670 --> 00:29:27.632
You think you can make
it, but you can't.

00:29:27.632 --> 00:29:29.272
STUDENT: You could actually
construct it as

00:29:29.272 --> 00:29:30.584
a 3-D object, though.

00:29:34.260 --> 00:29:34.900
PATRICK WINSTON: He
thinks you can

00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:37.570
construct it as a 3-D object.

00:29:37.570 --> 00:29:40.790
Let me show you the next
example, Christopher.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:42.040
Consider this example.

00:29:52.956 --> 00:29:56.570
Can you make that?

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.300
Your intuition is yes.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:29:59.550
So let's label it.

00:30:11.126 --> 00:30:12.480
Oh, I've already lost.

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.890
We just boost that up a
little bit to make the

00:30:18.890 --> 00:30:20.140
situation more clear.

00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.670
So already, I've got myself in
a situation where I can't

00:30:28.670 --> 00:30:31.230
label that.

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:33.090
But you feel like
you can make it.

00:30:33.090 --> 00:30:36.290
So what's wrong?

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.560
What's wrong is--

00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:38.220
what, Elliott?

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:39.350
STUDENT: You have
an obscured--

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:44.126
or, we're presuming that we have
an obscured [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:44.126 --> 00:30:51.400
alley from the upper-left corner
to the [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.490
PATRICK WINSTON: Putting a
little interpretation on what

00:30:53.490 --> 00:30:55.660
Elliott has said.

00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:59.410
If you look at this situation
back here, you get a

00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:02.600
four-faced junction there.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.700
So you can make it.

00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:06.000
But not with three faces.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.030
So some of these look like
you could make it.

00:31:10.030 --> 00:31:12.900
But they can't be labeled
because you need more than

00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:16.300
four faces at a junction.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:18.650
And we can carry that
idea back here.

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:19.780
You can make this OK.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.810
But this junction, you've got
two in the back and two here.

00:31:22.810 --> 00:31:24.970
So it has four faces.

00:31:24.970 --> 00:31:27.720
Same idea.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:37.970
So that's Guzman's
contribution.

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.080
That's Huffman's contribution.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:41.900
Huffman was a mathematician.

00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:43.900
But we wanted to build robots
back in those days.

00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:46.790
And neither one of these guys
solved the problem of dealing

00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:51.530
with natural objects with
shadows, with cracks, with

00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:55.710
more than trihedral vertexes
in space, and

00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:57.585
what to do about that?

00:31:57.585 --> 00:32:02.110
Well, that was a problem that
another graduate student,

00:32:02.110 --> 00:32:03.840
David Waltz, set
about to solve.

00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:15.310
So Waltz decided that he would
not be content unless he added

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:25.170
cracks, shadows, non-trihedral
vertexes.

00:32:29.123 --> 00:32:30.560
Uh--

00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:31.810
yeah, non-trihedral vertexes.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:39.580
And light.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:48.630
These considerations led
Waltz to go from

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:53.450
four labels to 50-plus.

00:32:53.450 --> 00:32:55.810
Because he had to pack a lot
of information into each of

00:32:55.810 --> 00:32:57.760
the labels he put on a line.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.110
What kind of light
was on the right?

00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:00.310
What kind of light
was on the left?

00:33:00.310 --> 00:33:01.140
Maybe it's a crack.

00:33:01.140 --> 00:33:02.630
Maybe it's a crack that--

00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.850
all sorts of considerations.

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:08.360
Here we had 18 ways that
lines can come

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.610
together around junctions.

00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:18.130
That went to thousands of
junctions in Waltz's world.

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:19.380
So here's Guzman.

00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.410
He writes a program that
sort of works.

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.500
Down below, we have Huffman.

00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:48.090
Huffman, who has a theory but
solves the wrong problem.

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:50.500
So here comes Waltz, and he's
trying to solve the right

00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:55.810
problem with a satisfying
theory that has a

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.720
generalizable principle.

00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.710
So when we get all through
this, we'll talk about

00:34:00.710 --> 00:34:01.960
criteria for success.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.060
And we'll conclude that to
have a really successful

00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.670
thing, you need a problem,
to start with.

00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:08.790
You need a method that works.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:09.850
And you have to show
that it works

00:34:09.850 --> 00:34:12.040
because of some principal.

00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:17.040
So Guzman had the problem and
something that worked.

00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:20.219
Huffman had a method which
worked on the wrong problem.

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.790
And it's left to Waltz to
bring it all together.

00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:24.770
So Waltz does all this work.

00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.530
And now he has, instead at 18
labels, he has thousands.

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:32.469
Instead of four-line labels,
he has more than 50.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.280
So naturally, it becomes
difficult to

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.659
work these by hand.

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:42.639
We were able to work those
Huffman examples by hand.

00:34:42.639 --> 00:34:45.018
We started with labeling
everything on the boundary and

00:34:45.018 --> 00:34:45.580
worked our way in.

00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:46.960
There's no particular
method there.

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.650
It was just easy to work
out the puzzle.

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:55.500
But poor Waltz, he didn't
have that luxury.

00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.910
So he might have, in a typical
scene, he might have tens or

00:34:58.910 --> 00:35:04.130
even hundreds of junctions to
label and no easy way of

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:04.930
dealing with it.

00:35:04.930 --> 00:35:11.060
So naturally writes himself a
depth-first search program.

00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:19.420
So here is vertex, or rather
junction number 1.

00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:25.080
There are many choices for which
label can be used on it.

00:35:25.080 --> 00:35:29.070
And for each of those choices,
whatever he's decided junction

00:35:29.070 --> 00:35:34.090
number 2 is has its own suite
of possibilities.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:35.670
And so it becomes a
simple depth-first

00:35:35.670 --> 00:35:39.040
search problem, right?

00:35:39.040 --> 00:35:42.580
So in actuality, as
soon as Waltz--

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:43.940
he was my office mate
at the time.

00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:45.960
I can tell you this
for a fact.

00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:48.080
As soon as he wrote this
program, he kept looking over

00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:48.900
at the computer--

00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:50.290
they were big in those days.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:51.540
They all had lights.

00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.270
So you looked over at the
computer to see if the lights

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.860
were still blinking.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:58.290
Because he'd start this
depth-first search program up

00:35:58.290 --> 00:36:00.080
and nothing would happen.

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:02.820
He thought the computer
had crashed.

00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.520
Nothing happened.

00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:07.550
Why did nothing happen?

00:36:07.550 --> 00:36:11.350
Because the search base is
exponential and much too big

00:36:11.350 --> 00:36:13.570
for an ordinary computer,
or maybe

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:15.970
even an ordinary universe.

00:36:15.970 --> 00:36:20.490
So Waltz has to do
something else.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.130
He has to come up with a new
method for using all these

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.080
labels that he's--

00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:29.410
after about a year and a half's
worth of hard work,

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:31.990
with lots of paper on his
desk in little blocks.

00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:35.230
After year and a half of hard
work getting all these

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.560
junction labels figured out, he
then has to come up with a

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:40.850
method for figuring out
how to use them.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.210
And so we don't know whether
to think his biggest

00:36:43.210 --> 00:36:46.390
contribution was that label
set or his method.

00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:50.328
And probably both deserve
about equal billing.

00:36:50.328 --> 00:36:54.710
Oh, I don't know how to explain
what Waltz did.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:57.470
Well, one way is to
do an example.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:58.875
And I think I will hazard
an example.

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:12.000
Let's see.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.165
Let me find some space.

00:37:13.165 --> 00:37:15.000
I think I'm reduced to
going over here.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:16.835
But that will be convenient,
since the

00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:18.085
line labels are here.

00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:25.630
Here's my example.

00:37:36.372 --> 00:37:39.650
And you say, how can I give you
just part of a picture?

00:37:39.650 --> 00:37:42.140
Well, you can assume
I'm looking at

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.690
this through a window.

00:37:43.690 --> 00:37:46.290
So the edge of the window form
boundary lines, and they exert

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:49.350
no constraint whatsoever
on what's behind them.

00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.760
So this is a legitimate
drawing to

00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:53.470
have to think about.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:54.950
By the way, is this ambiguous?

00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:57.630
Or do you get a firm sense
that there's a unique

00:37:57.630 --> 00:38:00.650
interpretation of
all those lines?

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:02.760
I think there's a unique
interpretation

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:04.640
of all those lines.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:07.130
What I'm going to do is I'm
actually going to solve this

00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:11.510
problem using Huffman's labels
but Waltz's method.

00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:14.900
Because I can't simulate on the
blackboard something with

00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.650
50 line types and thousands
of line junctions.

00:38:17.650 --> 00:38:20.950
So I'm going to use
Huffman's set to

00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:23.390
demonstrate Waltz's algorithm.

00:38:23.390 --> 00:38:32.040
So Waltz's algorithm involves
starting out by plopping on

00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:39.080
some junction all of the
possible labels that the

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.120
answer has to be drawn from.

00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.670
So let me number these in the
order that we're going to

00:38:43.670 --> 00:38:45.876
visit them.

00:38:45.876 --> 00:38:47.070
Like so.

00:38:47.070 --> 00:38:53.080
And so far, I've just put down
the three fork options that

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:57.010
are resident on that
first junction.

00:38:57.010 --> 00:39:00.650
And I have to take note of
exactly what they do with the

00:39:00.650 --> 00:39:03.660
lines that come out
of the junction.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:04.160
So let's see.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.920
I'll just copy them down.

00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:08.760
One possibility is this one.

00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.350
Another possibility
is this one.

00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:17.590
And another possibility
is plus, plus, minus.

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.840
Oops, I've got plus, plus.

00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:20.020
No, that's right.

00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.410
So that right so far?

00:39:21.410 --> 00:39:23.840
All I've done is copy
the junction

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.045
labelings from my library.

00:39:27.045 --> 00:39:31.760
And at this point, Waltz's
algorithm says there's nothing

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.810
else to do but go on to
junction number two.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:40.630
And unfortunately, sadly, there
are lots of labelings

00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:43.260
that have to be considered
on junction number 2.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:46.170
Six of them.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:49.960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.090
So one of them looks
like that.

00:39:52.090 --> 00:39:54.250
Another one looks like that.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:57.180
One of them is plus
here, arrow in.

00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:06.890
Another one is plus
here, arrow out.

00:40:06.890 --> 00:40:14.130
Another one is minus
here, arrow down.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.020
And minus here, arrow up.

00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:19.615
I think I've copied
those all right.

00:40:19.615 --> 00:40:23.950
But now, having copied those
down, Waltz's algorithm looks

00:40:23.950 --> 00:40:27.760
around at the neighboring
junctions and says, are any of

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:32.130
the things that I just placed on
junction two disallowed by

00:40:32.130 --> 00:40:36.250
what I've already placed on
a neighboring junction?

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:42.100
So it looks over here
in step number two.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:49.050
And it sees that these three
arrows require the line that

00:40:49.050 --> 00:40:54.540
joins junctions 1 and 2 to
be either minus or plus.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.690
So of the six possibilities, I
can only keep the ones that

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:04.730
are likewise content to put
a plus on that line

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:07.160
that joins the two.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.760
So that means that the influence
flowing from

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:19.870
junction 1 eliminates that
one, eliminates that one,

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:23.590
eliminates that one, and
eliminates that one.

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:26.670
So half of them are gone.

00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:31.540
All the ones that try to put a
boundary line on that line

00:41:31.540 --> 00:41:34.335
between 1 and 2 are
disallowed.

00:41:34.335 --> 00:41:36.740
All right?

00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:39.730
Now likewise, we could say,
well, of the remaining ones,

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:43.550
do they restrict what I
can do at junction 1?

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.050
So let's see.

00:41:44.050 --> 00:41:45.520
Here's a minus.

00:41:45.520 --> 00:41:46.680
And here's a plus.

00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:54.300
So all these possibilities over
here are still alive.

00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.690
So now, continuing on, we have
to see what we can do at

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:00.550
junction 3.

00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:03.360
These are arrow labels again.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:06.030
So we have to copy exactly
the same labels

00:42:06.030 --> 00:42:07.280
set as we had before.

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:18.810
And now we look down at junction
2 and say, well, what

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:22.920
does that tell me about the
three that I've just placed?

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.820
If we look up from junction
2 to see what kind of

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:31.000
constraints it puts on here,
we have this one alive and

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.710
this one alive.

00:42:31.710 --> 00:42:34.040
I guess we've eliminated
four of the six.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:36.010
So we have these two alive.

00:42:36.010 --> 00:42:38.990
And they both but
boundary lines--

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:41.920
I think I must have had this
boundary line wrong, right?

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.170
No, that's right.

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:46.760
Oh yes, I see.

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.130
Plus.

00:42:51.130 --> 00:42:52.920
This one goes--

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:54.655
hang on a second.

00:42:54.655 --> 00:42:56.020
You let me do something wrong.

00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:02.396
So plus is out.

00:43:02.396 --> 00:43:03.770
And that must be
one that goes--

00:43:03.770 --> 00:43:06.360
this minus goes up.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.040
Oh, yes.

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:11.980
I'm too hasty and uncertain
about what I was doing.

00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.570
So let's see.

00:43:13.570 --> 00:43:15.660
This guy has a boundary
going down.

00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:18.140
And this guy has a boundary
going up.

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:20.390
All of the others have
been eliminated.

00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.780
So that means that something
that tries to put a concave

00:43:22.780 --> 00:43:24.580
line there is gone.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:28.340
And something that tries to put
a plus line there is gone.

00:43:28.340 --> 00:43:32.490
So the influence flowing up in
this direction in the third

00:43:32.490 --> 00:43:36.300
step eliminates that guy and
eliminates that guy, leaving

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:39.460
only this guy.

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:41.200
But now, the thing I was worried
about is you have to

00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.810
also at this point go down to
2 and see if there's any

00:43:44.810 --> 00:43:50.030
further constraint on what can
survive down there, based on

00:43:50.030 --> 00:43:53.440
what has happened over
here at junction 3.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.170
Now let's see.

00:43:55.170 --> 00:43:58.190
This one goes up, which is
compatible with a survivor.

00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.860
But this one goes down,
which is not

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.020
compatible with a survivor.

00:44:02.020 --> 00:44:05.930
So when I bring this down in
step three, this guy is

00:44:05.930 --> 00:44:07.470
eliminated.

00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:12.590
So now I'm down to just one
interpretation for what can be

00:44:12.590 --> 00:44:15.140
going on at vertex number 2.

00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:20.290
And one interpretation
for vertex number 3.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.190
Now let's see.

00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:22.360
This can propagate.

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.840
So now that I've made a change
on vertex number 2, I have to

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.640
also see if that causes a change
at vertex number 1.

00:44:30.640 --> 00:44:32.540
So it's propagating through.

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:36.030
And now I can see that the only
possibility here is a

00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:39.730
minus, the label that's coming
down from our survivor.

00:44:39.730 --> 00:44:42.730
So that eliminates these two.

00:44:42.730 --> 00:44:43.620
Whew!

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:46.560
It's hard to do this by hand,
but I've got three of the four

00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.530
things labeled.

00:44:48.530 --> 00:44:51.940
And even with just three of the
four labeled, I'm down to

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.870
a single interpretation for all
of the junctions and the

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.120
lines between them.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.370
So there's one left.

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:03.080
We have to deal with
that fork vertex.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:05.240
We better deal with it, because
for all we know, this

00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:09.140
is not a legal drawing
in this world.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:15.180
We have five fork vertexes
to place.

00:45:15.180 --> 00:45:16.370
But you know what?

00:45:16.370 --> 00:45:18.860
I don't have to draw much here,
because I know this is

00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.640
forced to be a plus now.

00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.840
And this is forced
to be a plus now.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:24.730
And there's only one fork
vertex with any

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:26.940
pluses on it at all.

00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:29.800
So now I can come through and
say, well, the only possible

00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.580
survivor is this one.

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:34.440
These are gone.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:36.540
And now I have an
interpretation

00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:39.850
for all of the junctions.

00:45:39.850 --> 00:45:42.830
And I see that the winners
are this one.

00:45:42.830 --> 00:45:45.310
And this one.

00:45:45.310 --> 00:45:47.900
And this one.

00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:50.240
And this one.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.120
So I've got a unique
interpretation.

00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.260
This line is convex.

00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:55.620
This one is concave.

00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:56.830
This is a boundary.

00:45:56.830 --> 00:45:57.560
That's a boundary.

00:45:57.560 --> 00:45:59.604
And this line is convex,
and that's convex.

00:46:02.770 --> 00:46:04.655
Now that's a lot of work.

00:46:04.655 --> 00:46:07.020
So I better check and make
sure I got it right.

00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.840
You'd like to see this
demonstrated to make sure I

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.840
haven't made a mistake.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.090
I'm sure of that.

00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.545
Let's see.

00:46:18.545 --> 00:46:19.795
That it?

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:28.940
So each of the places where a
line is obscured has four

00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:32.190
possibilities, labeled E. The
arrow junctions are labeled A.

00:46:32.190 --> 00:46:35.710
The forks-- there are five of
them-- at the fork junction 5.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:39.890
So let's just step through here
and see what happens.

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:40.340
Boom.

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.320
I've got it.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:43.570
I did do it right.

00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:50.330
So let's try some more.

00:46:54.010 --> 00:46:55.820
What do you think will
happen with this one?

00:46:55.820 --> 00:46:57.070
Unique solution?

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.746
It stopped.

00:47:04.746 --> 00:47:07.390
Bug in my program?

00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:09.500
Unthinkable.

00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.280
What's happened?

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.220
It is genuinely ambiguous.

00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:17.790
It can be something hanging
down from the ceiling.

00:47:17.790 --> 00:47:22.920
Or it could be something that
we can think of as a step

00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:26.170
going up from left to right.

00:47:26.170 --> 00:47:27.420
Let's look at something
more complicated.

00:47:33.910 --> 00:47:36.490
You think it'll work?

00:47:36.490 --> 00:47:38.960
Not enough constraint for us
to figure that one out.

00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:43.530
It's equally ambiguous, but a
little bit larger example.

00:47:43.530 --> 00:47:44.780
What about this one?

00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:50.130
Yeah, but the stuff is creeping
up from the lower

00:47:50.130 --> 00:47:53.710
left up to the upper right.

00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:54.500
Yeah, bingo.

00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:55.210
It worked.

00:47:55.210 --> 00:47:56.800
It's unambiguous.

00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.410
It's variation on the same
theme we had before.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:01.980
But let me, just for fun, take
these two lines out.

00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.510
What do you think
will happen now?

00:48:09.190 --> 00:48:13.810
Seems to be doing just fine
until it hits the upper

00:48:13.810 --> 00:48:15.560
right-hand corner and discovers

00:48:15.560 --> 00:48:17.240
it can't label stuff.

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:19.530
So it propagates back down.

00:48:19.530 --> 00:48:22.200
And what looked OK in
the lower left is

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.190
no good after all.

00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:28.510
So these results are kind of
consistent with what we humans

00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:30.510
do when we look at these
kinds of things.

00:48:30.510 --> 00:48:34.120
So it's very likely that we,
in our heads, do have some

00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:35.740
constraint propagation
apparatus

00:48:35.740 --> 00:48:37.590
that we use in vision.

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:40.200
But putting that aside, we can
think about other kinds of

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:42.940
intelligence different from
human, that might use this

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:46.070
kind of mechanism to solve
problems that involve a lot of

00:48:46.070 --> 00:48:48.480
constraint in finding
a solution.

00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:52.780
So here, we saw the constraint
propagation activity at work

00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.380
on line drawing analysis.

00:48:54.380 --> 00:48:55.780
But next time, what we're going
do is we're going to see

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.910
at work in map coloring.

00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:58.970
And who cares about
map coloring?

00:48:58.970 --> 00:49:01.100
People who do scheduling,
because that turns out to be

00:49:01.100 --> 00:49:02.350
the same problem.

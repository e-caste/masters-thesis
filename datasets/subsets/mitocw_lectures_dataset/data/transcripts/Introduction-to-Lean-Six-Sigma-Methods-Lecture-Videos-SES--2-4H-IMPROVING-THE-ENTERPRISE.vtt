00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:28.075
EARLL MURMAN: OK, the
title of this module

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:29.530
is Improving the Enterprise.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.600
And just to put
it in context, we

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.070
inherited a poorly
performing clinic.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.390
We have applied lean,
what we call local lean.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.970
But now we're going
to look at, how

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.950
do you handle issues that are
outside the span of control

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.310
of the clinic?

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.840
And this is where
you usually end up.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.360
That's the objective for
the rest of the afternoon,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.777
with the exception of the very--

00:00:51.777 --> 00:00:53.360
at very end, we're
going to tee you up

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.920
on a homework assignment.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.470
OK, so if you want to
improve the whole enterprise,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.850
you can't just do it locally.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.280
You'll end up suboptimizing
the enterprise.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:02.720
You may optimize
yourself locally,

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.910
but you'll suboptimize
the enterprise.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.610
So we want to work through
on how organizations

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.180
can adapt to external
constraints and implement lean.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.970
And the mode we're
going to do this

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.460
is something called a rapid
process improvement workshop,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.280
which is one way to
implement lean across a wider

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.020
group than what you have here.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.270
We're going to look at
including a daily management

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.550
system, which is a
little bit of an add-on.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.490
And then we're going to see we
have some trouble doing that,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.110
and we'll discuss it.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.400
OK, so just to frame this,
health care operations

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.110
are often impacted
by decisions which

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.080
are outside the
control of the clinic.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.390
I mean, this is
regulations, insurance,

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.190
resource constraints.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.070
We had something
earlier this afternoon,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.560
where we had some
change of employees.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.050
It was beyond the
purview of the clinic.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.820
We had to adjust for that.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.460
That was a disruptive
thing we had to handle,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.560
which is not unusual.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.115
And we need to optimize
at the enterprise level,

00:02:00.115 --> 00:02:00.990
as I've already said.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.187
Otherwise, we may not optimize
across our whole enterprise.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:11.540
OK, I think this has
already been contained.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.450
What I'd really like to
do is get some examples

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.950
from your own experience.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.300
Or what are some external
things that you've

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.174
experienced that have disrupted
your enterprises you work with?

00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:25.674
Yeah?

00:02:25.674 --> 00:02:29.390
AUDIENCE: Well, just patients
showing up all in one bunch.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.990
Like when I was on triage
as a medicine resident,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.400
all of our admissions would show
up at 4:30 in the afternoon.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.400
Because everyone was coming
to the ER in the afternoon.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.820
And then, by the time
they got worked up,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.870
that load would hit the
medicine admitting team at 4:30.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.160
So it's kind of the--

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.410
EARLL MURMAN: So yeah,
this is a classic thing,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.658
isn't it, that the one
department in the enterprise

00:02:53.658 --> 00:02:54.950
impacting the other department.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.470
And it's out of your control.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.100
And of course, yeah, exactly.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:04.295
And it can happen the other
way, too, that the admissions,

00:03:04.295 --> 00:03:06.170
they're not being admitted
into the hospital.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.990
So they're piling up in the
ER and affecting the ER.

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.900
OK.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:11.530
Other things?

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:12.355
Yeah?

00:03:12.355 --> 00:03:13.585
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:14.460
EARLL MURMAN: Pardon?

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.070
AUDIENCE: Funding.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.700
EARLL MURMAN: Funding.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.570
OK, so resources--
here's the thing, where

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.780
you know you can do something.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.390
You want to do something, but
you can't get the funding.

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.400
Or maybe you get the funding,
and then there's a reduction.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.275
I mean, that's happening
in my local hospital

00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:28.390
now in Washington state.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:33.220
The state's grappling with a $2
billion budget shortfall gap.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.470
And they provide
basic health coverage

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.650
for underemployed
people in the state.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.300
I live in a rural community.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.130
My hospital has a
lot of these people.

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.050
They're about ready to
lose all that money,

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.600
and they still have
to treat the patients.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:47.907
OK.

00:03:47.907 --> 00:03:48.990
It's beyond their control.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.970
I mean, they can go down to
Olympia and lobby a little bit.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.010
But basically, it's
beyond their control.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.647
Yeah?

00:03:53.647 --> 00:03:55.980
AUDIENCE: So I've been working
on a telephone operations

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.190
improvement project recently
with an ancillary department,

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.170
where we only have
three front desk staff.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.540
And our intervention
was to separate

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.550
one of the front
phones in the back area

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.133
and then have just the
front desk staff locked

00:04:08.133 --> 00:04:10.050
at the front, directly
interact with patients,

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.480
and not have to worry
about phone calls.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.310
And in doing our pilot, to the
two-week PBSA pilot, some days,

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.660
we only had one staff
actually show up to work.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.625
So obviously, our plan
didn't go as it would have,

00:04:23.625 --> 00:04:25.380
if we had the three staff.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.430
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.170
So there you got
an employee issue.

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:29.880
Yeah.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.560
It might have
unreliable employees,

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.740
or maybe there are complications
in their family life,

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.240
that they couldn't
come or whatever.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.430
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] sick.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.030
EARLL MURMAN: Sick, yeah.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:40.750
Any other examples?

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:41.555
Yeah?

00:04:41.555 --> 00:04:43.180
AUDIENCE: The
recession-- our economics

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.820
and how it affects our
patients [INAUDIBLE]..

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.403
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah, I mean, we
can't control the world, right?

00:04:48.403 --> 00:04:51.040
We're in an environment
imposed on us,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.940
and we have to deal with it.

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.150
Yeah.

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.400
Any examples you can think of?

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.510
AUDIENCE: Space constraints.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.843
EARLL MURMAN: Space constraints.

00:04:57.843 --> 00:05:01.490
AUDIENCE: When your capacity
exceeds your [INAUDIBLE]..

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.560
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah, just
not enough facilities.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.680
OK, so these are not
unusual disruptions.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.670
OK, so we say this
is a statement.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.620
I suppose it may be
more of a hypothesis.

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:17.560
But the lean organizations,
by their nature,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.870
are maybe more
adaptable to change

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.540
than other organizations.

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.670
First of all, you're
process-oriented.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.490
You think about processes.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:32.888
You think less about side
or turfs or rice bowls,

00:05:32.888 --> 00:05:33.930
or those kinds of things.

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.780
You get process-oriented
and think about,

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.580
how do you change your process?

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.590
If you have standardization,
which you should

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.330
if you're a good
lean organization,

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.580
it means you're going to
have fewer things to change.

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.500
You have a stable base
on which to change,

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.650
as opposed to many things
that have to be changed.

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.080
You're used to thinking of
things in rapid cycle times.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.870
And that's going to be really
this whole rapid process

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.345
improvement workshop,
adapting to change quickly.

00:05:58.345 --> 00:05:59.720
And you just have
a culture where

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.420
you're accepting of change.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.202
Lean is a Journey.

00:06:03.202 --> 00:06:04.160
You're always changing.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.618
You're always trying
to get better.

00:06:05.618 --> 00:06:07.500
So you're not fearful of change.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.960
So these are all things that,
in terms of a lean organization,

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.450
help you in dealing with
these external constraints.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.510
Just to anchor this back in this
process improvement framework

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:23.080
we've been using-- and by
the way, a copy of this

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.130
is in your folders, just
for your reference purposes.

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:28.510
And why we put it
there is to try

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:35.710
to impart a thought process of
structured approach to change

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.690
and not ad hoc
approach to change.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:39.708
So this is one
structured approach.

00:06:39.708 --> 00:06:41.500
There are many other
structured approaches.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.140
This is one that we adopted,
just to give you one.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.390
And right now, we're in here.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.617
We're going to be doing another.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:50.200
We're going to have
some changes we're

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.700
going to introduce to you.

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:53.548
They're going to be
beyond your control.

00:06:53.548 --> 00:06:55.090
And we're going to
have to figure out

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:57.430
how to respond to them,
develop an implementation plan,

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.630
and try it out.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:02.095
And in doing this, as you
go beyond your clinic,

00:07:02.095 --> 00:07:03.970
you're going to have to
interact with a wider

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:05.630
group of stakeholders.

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:07.570
And that's part of
the complexity of it.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.600
We've heard from Beau, for
example, already about that.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.960
So let's talk a little
bit about stakeholders.

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.170
We had this slide up yesterday
in a slightly different format.

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.360
But a health care
enterprise like yours

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:20.890
has a lot of stakeholders.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.250
And let's just try to identify,
in the interest of time

00:07:24.250 --> 00:07:27.880
and keeping this focus,
for our clinics here,

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.028
who are our major stakeholders?

00:07:30.028 --> 00:07:30.820
AUDIENCE: Patients.

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.700
EARLL MURMAN: Patients, OK.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:34.330
OK.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:35.163
AUDIENCE: Suppliers.

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.972
EARLL MURMAN: Suppliers, OK.

00:07:37.972 --> 00:07:38.805
AUDIENCE: Providers.

00:07:38.805 --> 00:07:41.080
AUDIENCE: Providers and
doctors and the medical staff.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.505
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah, so you
have the staff, medical staff.

00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:45.380
Why don't we just put
all the staff together.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.670
There's the medical
and the administrative.

00:07:48.670 --> 00:07:50.260
For now, let's
just call it staff.

00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.650
Any other stakeholders in our
simulated clinic environment?

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:55.590
AUDIENCE: Investors?

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.005
EARLL MURMAN: Investors, OK.

00:08:00.562 --> 00:08:03.010
AUDIENCE: The government.

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.120
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.640
The government is an
important stakeholder,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:10.347
but probably not so much for
our classroom environment here.

00:08:10.347 --> 00:08:11.930
But there is another
important-- yeah?

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:13.900
AUDIENCE: Oh,
whoever's regulating.

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.358
EARLL MURMAN: We've
got management.

00:08:15.358 --> 00:08:17.290
It's called managers--

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:21.640
CFO or CMO, or whatever it is.

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.560
You've got somebody
you're reporting to.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.690
They keep imposing new
things on you and saying,

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:27.040
you can't do this,
you can't do that.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.707
AUDIENCE: You've got
the payers as well.

00:08:28.707 --> 00:08:30.760
EARLL MURMAN: Payers, OK.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.710
We haven't actually collected
any money from them yet. .

00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:36.312
OK, this is a pretty good group.

00:08:36.312 --> 00:08:37.770
So let's just stay
with that group.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:39.789
But you can imagine, in a
more complex enterprise,

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:41.039
you're going have more people.

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:43.806
You'll have regulators.

00:08:43.806 --> 00:08:47.770
You might have partners.

00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:51.160
My hospital, for example,
can't do a number of procedures

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.000
as a small hospital.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.040
So partners with
Swedish Hospital,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.500
in Seattle, and Harrison
Hospital, in Bremerton,

00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.290
these are important
stakeholders; EMS systems.

00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:01.960
They're all sorts
of other partners.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.480
Now, we had this slide
up yesterday, too.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:07.990
But each of these stakeholders
expects some value

00:09:07.990 --> 00:09:10.010
from your enterprise.

00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:12.610
So let's just think,
what value do patients

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:15.960
expect from your clinic?

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.710
AUDIENCE: Quality.

00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.627
EARLL MURMAN: Quality.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:24.890
OK, so remember, we've
been doing that managements

00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.560
ask you, every so often,
did some patient get

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.240
treated incorrectly?

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.140
That's a concern
they track that.

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.190
AUDIENCE: Affordability.

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.250
EARLL MURMAN: Affordability.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:33.750
OK.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.880
Maybe we should introduce
a pay for service,

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.620
pay for performance
option in this simulation.

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:45.880
We haven't done that yet.

00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.380
OK.

00:09:46.380 --> 00:09:47.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.490
AUDIENCE: Quick access?

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:49.590
EARLL MURMAN: Access, yep.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:55.080
Access-- they want
to get treated.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:56.078
AUDIENCE: The time.

00:09:56.078 --> 00:09:56.870
EARLL MURMAN: Time?

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.495
AUDIENCE: Time.

00:09:57.495 --> 00:09:58.580
EARLL MURMAN: Time.

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.810
OK.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.000
That's a metric
we've been tracking.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.530
AUDIENCE: Safety [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:05.250
Safety.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:06.818
EARLL MURMAN: Safety.

00:10:06.818 --> 00:10:08.610
Yeah, it's a little
bit related to quality,

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:11.350
but we'll put it here.

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.000
OK, how about the suppliers?

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.670
What are they?

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:17.800
And by the way, also,
this is a two-way street.

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.170
I mean, they expect value,
and you expect value.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:25.080
Suppliers-- what are some
of the value considerations

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.430
that come in with suppliers?

00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:28.336
AUDIENCE: Accuracy?

00:10:28.336 --> 00:10:29.940
You got the order accuracy.

00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:33.025
EARLL MURMAN: Accuracy, OK.

00:10:33.025 --> 00:10:33.900
AUDIENCE: Timeliness.

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.024
EARLL MURMAN: Timeliness.

00:10:36.024 --> 00:10:38.160
AUDIENCE: Cost.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:38.952
EARLL MURMAN: Cost.

00:10:38.952 --> 00:10:41.580
And what do you expect
from your suppliers?

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.955
What value do you expect to get?

00:10:43.955 --> 00:10:44.830
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:44.830 --> 00:10:45.310
AUDIENCE: Quality.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.227
EARLL MURMAN: Quality.

00:10:49.390 --> 00:10:54.970
AUDIENCE: Reliability,
in both ways, I guess,

00:10:54.970 --> 00:11:00.010
that they rely on a
steady stream of orders.

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:00.903
EARLL MURMAN: Oh, OK.

00:11:00.903 --> 00:11:03.070
And you rely on them
delivering it when you need it.

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:03.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.880
I mean, they don't want you
to go to their competitors.

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:09.582
EARLL MURMAN: Are you guys
happy with your suppliers?

00:11:09.582 --> 00:11:10.540
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:11.680
AUDIENCE: Generally.

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.680
EARLL MURMAN: If you had
to rate 0 to 10, how would

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:17.240
you rate your
suppliers, 0 to 10.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:17.740
AUDIENCE: 8.

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.395
EARLL MURMAN: 8.

00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:22.020
AUDIENCE: Probably
just a [INAUDIBLE]..

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:22.520
5.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.870
EARLL MURMAN: Our
supplier just joined us.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:26.370
OK.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:31.094
OK, what value do
the staff expect?

00:11:31.094 --> 00:11:33.514
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:38.320
EARLL MURMAN: What do you want
to get out of your clinic?

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.730
AUDIENCE: Not
feeling overloaded.

00:11:39.730 --> 00:11:40.630
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:42.105
You want an acceptable workload.

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:46.982
AUDIENCE: Just then
value-added work.

00:11:46.982 --> 00:11:48.440
EARLL MURMAN:
Value-added work, OK.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.657
Do you feel like they're
doing value-added work now?

00:11:50.657 --> 00:11:51.240
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:51.680
EARLL MURMAN: Yes?

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.180
Good.

00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.780
All right.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:58.070
Thinking back to the exercise
in the people module yesterday

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:00.390
about some of the things
you value as employees--

00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.790
you're the staff--

00:12:01.790 --> 00:12:03.886
what are things
that come to mind?

00:12:03.886 --> 00:12:06.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] respect.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:09.160
EARLL MURMAN: Respect.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.573
AUDIENCE: Cooperation.

00:12:11.573 --> 00:12:13.490
EARLL MURMAN: I know
it's most the clinics are

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:14.420
working overtime.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.180
Is that something you like?

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
or something.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:22.310
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah, salary
was important, too, wasn't it?

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:23.510
AUDIENCE: Communication.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:24.677
EARLL MURMAN: Communication.

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:26.510
OK.

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.760
I'll show you a little
later on a slide.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.910
But my local hospital, what the
staff picked is their measure.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.160
Their surrogate metric they
track for their satisfaction

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:42.040
is finishing work on time
and not taking anything home.

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:43.600
That was the one
metric they track.

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.970
And they tracked that metric.

00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:46.303
AUDIENCE: Safety to [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:46.303 --> 00:12:47.680
EARLL MURMAN: Safety, yes.

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.832
AUDIENCE: And [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:49.832 --> 00:12:51.790
EARLL MURMAN: Oh, teamwork,
teamwork-- got you.

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:56.390
OK, so there's a long list here.

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.726
OK, let's not spend too
much more time on this.

00:12:59.726 --> 00:13:02.120
Let me just skip these two,
because they aren't really

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.570
too much players in our system.

00:13:03.570 --> 00:13:04.820
But what about our management?

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.962
What are they looking for?

00:13:06.962 --> 00:13:09.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:11.200
EARLL MURMAN:
Perform [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:11.800
Performance.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.070
We've got some metrics
up here they're tracking.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:18.650
We know they're
tracking performance.

00:13:18.650 --> 00:13:20.660
We're measuring it in
terms of patients served.

00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:24.590
We're looking at error
safety, basically, or errors,

00:13:24.590 --> 00:13:26.440
like quality.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.020
OK.

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:29.250
Legal reliability.

00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.360
EARLL MURMAN: Reliability.

00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:31.510
AUDIENCE: Legal liability.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:34.020
EARLL MURMAN: Oh,
legal liability.

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.342
AUDIENCE: Patient
satisfaction [INAUDIBLE]..

00:13:36.342 --> 00:13:37.800
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah,
they don't want

00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:40.090
to hear from angry patients.

00:13:40.090 --> 00:13:42.130
Luckily, our patients
aren't talking.

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.126
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:43.126 --> 00:13:44.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.220
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.785
Patient satisfaction.

00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:53.548
OK, well, I just
wanted to make--

00:13:53.548 --> 00:13:55.090
we wanted to bring
some of these out.

00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:58.270
And we're going to
start addressing them.

00:13:58.270 --> 00:13:59.155
So let's move on.

00:13:59.155 --> 00:14:01.530
I'm going to skip the next
slide, which is our discussion

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:04.530
slide, which we just did.

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:06.960
I'm going to put this up here.

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:09.865
But we're not going to spend
much time on ideal state now.

00:14:09.865 --> 00:14:11.490
Because we're a little
behind schedule.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:17.110
But we have a value stream.

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:19.600
We have an improved
value stream.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.350
And we've talked before about
thinking of the ideal state

00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:24.460
value stream.

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:27.700
And this is a nice quote that
comes from Sue's partner, Cindy

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:31.250
Jimmerson, whose book I
recommend to you, that this is

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.500
what the ideal state would be.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.375
"Giving the customers
exactly what they want,

00:14:34.375 --> 00:14:37.970
when they want it, is a core
principle of an ideal state."

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:41.513
OK, well, our customers,
our main customers,

00:14:41.513 --> 00:14:42.180
are our patient.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:46.260
So this is what we would really
like to do for our patient.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:47.760
So "as you observe
work in progress,

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:49.737
note the delays in care
created by caregivers

00:14:49.737 --> 00:14:51.820
waiting for the necessities
from their suppliers."

00:14:51.820 --> 00:14:53.640
Now, we don't have a
lot of suppliers here.

00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.140
But we have had
to wait for them.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.477
But that kind of delay
is just passed on.

00:14:57.477 --> 00:14:58.560
So this is another reason.

00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:01.080
If you want to optimize the
performance of your clinic

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.580
or improve it,
you're probably going

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.860
to have to include
your suppliers.

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.740
That's very common.

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:10.880
I'm going skip over this.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.325
OK, so that's just some
sort of framing discussion

00:15:13.325 --> 00:15:14.450
for what we're going to do.

00:15:14.450 --> 00:15:18.140
Now, management's told
me-- and the reason

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.000
they had me come today
to do some training,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.958
because management told
me that there are going

00:15:21.958 --> 00:15:25.130
to be some disruptions coming
soon from the enterprise,

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:27.830
from these CXOs.

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:31.080
And they wanted me to get
you ready for handling those.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.150
OK, so this is going to
involve working across clinics

00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:37.050
to handle these disruptions.

00:15:37.050 --> 00:15:39.170
By the way, in terms
of access, and we

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:43.520
have a problem with
access here, some patients

00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:45.520
aren't being treated.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.640
We don't have the right
diagnostic equipment.

00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.310
So we're sending
them home untreated.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.510
And the management's
not happy about that.

00:15:51.510 --> 00:15:54.800
The patients are
unhappy about that.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.540
So how do we go about
working across clinics?

00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:59.180
OK, a good way to
do it is something

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:01.790
called a rapid process
improvement workshop.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:02.540
And what is that?

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.510
Well, that's a focus on
a specific improvement

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.400
opportunity, as
we're going to have

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.630
coming up here in a minute.

00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:12.050
It's an event that's
chartered by a sponsor

00:16:12.050 --> 00:16:14.990
in the organization, one
of the managements, who

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:18.440
sets the goals, the what has to
be done, and the constraints,

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.180
and provides the resources.

00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:21.198
And the resources are--

00:16:21.198 --> 00:16:22.490
we'll get to those in a minute.

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:23.573
But they're mainly people.

00:16:23.573 --> 00:16:27.690
They provide coaches and
facilitators to help you.

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.490
A rapid process
improvement workshop

00:16:29.490 --> 00:16:30.960
never goes over a week.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.140
Most of them are a week long.

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.750
Sometimes they're less, if
it's a less complex problem.

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.820
But it takes several months of
planning to get ready for this.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.600
And what it does is
it brings together,

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:46.530
for the week, all the people
who need to interact to address

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.690
this improvement opportunity.

00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:52.940
And the opposite of that
is that these people--

00:16:52.940 --> 00:16:56.340
the contrast would be that
these people are mainly

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.500
doing their day jobs,
wherever they are,

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.270
and you're trying to
do this improvement

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.840
opportunity over a
distributed group of people

00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:05.460
in time and space.

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.180
And what might take six months
to a year just to coordinate,

00:17:09.180 --> 00:17:11.265
you get done in one week.

00:17:11.265 --> 00:17:13.140
But in that week, that's
all these people do.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:15.210
They're released from all
their other activities,

00:17:15.210 --> 00:17:16.619
and they participate in this.

00:17:16.619 --> 00:17:18.732
And this is the kind
of thing that Sue does.

00:17:18.732 --> 00:17:20.190
I presume you run
these, don't you?

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:20.670
AUDIENCE: Some of them.

00:17:20.670 --> 00:17:21.462
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:17:21.462 --> 00:17:22.619
Yeah.

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:24.700
OK, so it involves
all the stakeholders.

00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:26.417
It's a very data-driven process.

00:17:26.417 --> 00:17:28.500
We've been trying to
emphasize you work with data.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.480
You get the value-stream data.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:35.010
The week ends with actually a
beginning of an implementation

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:37.140
and a plan for final
implementation.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.110
And so this is how you get
a whole enterprise together

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.410
by getting the right people.

00:17:41.410 --> 00:17:43.980
This is an example of one
I've drawn these slides from,

00:17:43.980 --> 00:17:45.660
where I sat through with this.

00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:47.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you're
actually implementing.

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.730
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah,
we actually implement.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.053
But we implement,
but there may be

00:17:52.053 --> 00:17:54.470
additional training and other
things that need to be done.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.778
And we'll show you
that in a minute.

00:17:56.778 --> 00:17:58.320
Here's diagrammatically
what that is.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.020
So we have a rapid process
improvement workshop

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.020
that's going to be
three to five days, say.

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:05.790
And it starts by
understanding what

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:07.740
is important to improve
in the enterprise.

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.240
And there's always more
to improve than resources.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.120
So you do some kind
of Pareto chart.

00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:15.150
We've done that informally
with this kind of thing we had,

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.490
which was, what were the big
bottlenecks you had to address?

00:18:18.490 --> 00:18:20.040
So you pick some target.

00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.280
You make a strategic choice on
what you're going to improve.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.620
And then you may take three
months or so to get ready.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.120
You have to go out
and get the data.

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:28.770
You have to figure out who
are the right stakeholders.

00:18:28.770 --> 00:18:31.710
You have to plan it so the
stakeholders can be available.

00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:34.860
You're going to pour a lot
of resources in for one week.

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.750
But you'll probably pour
a lot less resources

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.195
than if you try to stretch
it over six months to a year.

00:18:39.195 --> 00:18:41.820
PROFESSOR: And the agreement has
to be that the stakeholders do

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.340
not leave the room,
turn off cell phones,

00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.058
and they're cloistered
for the whole time.

00:18:47.058 --> 00:18:47.850
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:50.023
And they don't arrive late,
and they don't go back

00:18:50.023 --> 00:18:50.940
to some other meeting.

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:52.980
That's it.

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.970
And that's why you need
this top level support.

00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:59.060
OK, then that group
is given a charter.

00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:00.980
And they're given the
resources they need

00:19:00.980 --> 00:19:02.690
and the data they need.

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.520
And that's a really
intense week.

00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.770
Has anybody participated in
one of these rapid process

00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.510
improvement workshops?

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.500
Sue, Sue and I, and Hugh.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.690
You think this course
is maybe intense.

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:18.005
These are much more
intense than that.

00:19:18.005 --> 00:19:19.130
But the outcomes are great.

00:19:19.130 --> 00:19:23.130
So out of that comes your future
state and implementation plan.

00:19:23.130 --> 00:19:26.720
And as Sue said, you actually
do the prototype implementation

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.780
in place.

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.960
Sometimes you can't do
the final implementation.

00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.535
And then you track
it and make sure

00:19:32.535 --> 00:19:34.160
that it's performing
the way you think.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.600
And oftentimes,
you've misjudged.

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.100
You made a mistake somewhere.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:38.210
Training is a typical one.

00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:39.835
You didn't get people
trained properly,

00:19:39.835 --> 00:19:40.950
or something like that.

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:43.430
And so you may have to
do some follow-up action.

00:19:43.430 --> 00:19:47.420
And then you feed that back in
and do the next rapid process

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.215
improvement event.

00:19:48.215 --> 00:19:49.340
Who are these stakeholders?

00:19:49.340 --> 00:19:51.860
Well, you want to have the
people actually doing the work.

00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:53.460
In this case, that's you.

00:19:53.460 --> 00:19:54.462
OK?

00:19:54.462 --> 00:19:56.420
You want to have some
facilitators and coaches.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:57.900
That's Beau and me.

00:19:57.900 --> 00:20:02.320
And you might think of
Hugh as our sponsor.

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.480
If we were doing
something where suppose

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.850
we're going to implement
some new protocol.

00:20:06.850 --> 00:20:10.600
Well, we need people from the
training department to come.

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.415
We may need some IT people
to write some software.

00:20:14.415 --> 00:20:16.040
If we're doing
something more physical,

00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.110
we might have
facilities on board.

00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:20.140
They just saw down the
walls and move them,

00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:21.250
right during the week.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:24.150
I mean, this is really
action-oriented.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.530
OK, so you may need
some support facilities.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:30.670
And you want somebody up
there at the CEO level

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:32.227
who's championing it.

00:20:32.227 --> 00:20:34.060
And here's what takes
place during the week.

00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:37.860
So day one-- this
is for a five-day--

00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:38.610
you come together.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:39.693
You do some team-building.

00:20:39.693 --> 00:20:42.360
Make sure you're all being
able to work with each other.

00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.610
You go to the Gemba and
actually see what's happening,

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:48.027
make sure you understand
what the real problem is.

00:20:48.027 --> 00:20:50.610
You'll probably come in with a
current state map already done,

00:20:50.610 --> 00:20:52.020
because that takes some time.

00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.150
And you do a lot
of brainstorming.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:57.210
How are we going to address this
improvement opportunity that

00:20:57.210 --> 00:20:59.010
is given to us in our charter?

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:00.630
So day one is really
getting started.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.700
Day two-- go home and sleep out.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.000
You come back on day
two, and you say, OK,

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.330
from our brainstorming, we
think this is the way we can go.

00:21:09.330 --> 00:21:13.550
Here's going to be our draft
future state map and strategy.

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.680
And you have senior
management come

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.700
in the afternoon of day two
and say, here's where we're at.

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.560
And this is the
direction we want to go.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:22.880
Do we have your approval?

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.422
Let me give you the example I
went through in this one, which

00:21:25.422 --> 00:21:26.630
the pictures are taken from.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:30.680
This was, how do we treat
STEMI cases in our hospital?

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.790
And our hospital
can't do a catheter--

00:21:32.790 --> 00:21:34.550
doesn't have a catheter lab.

00:21:34.550 --> 00:21:39.410
And the treatment time
was from a presentation

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:43.730
to when they were getting
finally sent down to Bremerton.

00:21:43.730 --> 00:21:48.140
Treated was-- I've forgotten,
something like several hours.

00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.065
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:49.940
EARLL MURMAN: Pardon?

00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:51.920
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:54.120
EARLL MURMAN: STEMI
is S T Elevated--

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:55.520
AUDIENCE: S T segment elevation.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.618
It's higher tech.

00:21:56.618 --> 00:21:58.410
EARLL MURMAN: It's a
blockage [INAUDIBLE]..

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:00.202
AUDIENCE: A research
pattern that shows up,

00:22:00.202 --> 00:22:03.312
a leakage [INAUDIBLE] right now.

00:22:03.312 --> 00:22:04.020
EARLL MURMAN: OK.

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.120
So we gathered on day one.

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.602
And we immediately
found out, on day one,

00:22:10.602 --> 00:22:12.310
there was a constraint
that was so great,

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.590
we couldn't solve the problem.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.690
And that was, we
simply physically

00:22:15.690 --> 00:22:17.700
couldn't get the
patient to my town,

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:20.730
to Bremerton, within the
90-minute window that you

00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:22.210
use for STEMI treatment.

00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:24.530
And so actually, we were stuck.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:27.590
And then what happened, we got
the cardiologist on the phone

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:29.270
and said, we're stuck.

00:22:29.270 --> 00:22:31.610
And he said, well, if
you're stuck on that,

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.160
the next best thing is to get
him the thrombolytic drugs as

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:38.060
quickly as possible and
then get him to Bremerton.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.578
So we came up with
plan B. And plan B,

00:22:42.578 --> 00:22:44.870
put together that Monday
day-- this all happened Monday

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:48.020
morning, Monday afternoon--

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:50.210
was to focus on the patient.

00:22:50.210 --> 00:22:52.700
And the patient was
the organizing--

00:22:55.655 --> 00:22:57.780
everybody organized around
focusing on the patient.

00:22:57.780 --> 00:22:59.280
By the way, he had
six organizations

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.310
involved in this workshop--
two hospitals, two EMS drivers,

00:23:02.310 --> 00:23:04.400
and two cardiologist groups.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.050
And decision was,
the best we can do

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:09.230
is give the patient the
thrombolytic drugs in the EMS

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:11.530
vehicle on the way to Bremerton.

00:23:11.530 --> 00:23:13.780
OK?

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.270
And basically, we put the
hospital where the patient was,

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.860
is what we did.

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:21.850
And the big hangup was, who
pays for the thrombolytic drug?

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:24.002
Because it's $3,000.

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:25.460
They've never gone
to the hospital,

00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:27.085
so the hospital can't
be billed for it.

00:23:27.085 --> 00:23:31.467
The EMS company has no
authority to bill for drugs.

00:23:31.467 --> 00:23:33.050
They can only bill
for transportation.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:35.860
So we had a solution,
but a complete blockage.

00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:37.720
We brought in senior management.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:41.330
And the CEO, right
there, Vic Dirksen,

00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:44.480
said, this is the right
solution for the patient.

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:44.990
Do it.

00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:47.970
We'll figure out
how to pay for it.

00:23:47.970 --> 00:23:49.100
And we really needed that.

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.788
Without that commitment that
he would pay for the drug--

00:23:51.788 --> 00:23:52.580
that happened here.

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:56.630
Then the team put together
the new protocols.

00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.700
Here's the mock-up kit
for the thrombolytic drug

00:23:58.700 --> 00:24:02.500
that's going in the ambulance,
training materials, and so on.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.210
And by Friday afternoon,
we got by everybody

00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:06.780
we needed to do this.

00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.860
And by Friday afternoon, the
protocol was established.

00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.520
But it took about two or three
months to train the medics

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.700
and to make sure that the
hospitals were ready for it,

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:17.447
and all that.

00:24:17.447 --> 00:24:19.280
And that's now the
protocol in my community.

00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.110
And there are articles
about how many lives

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:24.350
it saved in my community.

00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:29.720
OK, that would have taken two
years to do by any other way.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.050
So that's one way to do it.

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.900
I just want to ask,
how does change

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:36.470
take place in your
organizations compared to this?

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:37.700
You're mostly students.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.865
But how about--

00:24:40.865 --> 00:24:41.740
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:43.240
EARLL MURMAN:
Jennifer, I could ask.

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:45.020
OK, good, and I'll
Jennifer, because she--

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.530
AUDIENCE: In our resident,
internal medicine residency

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:52.300
program, we were pretty active
in [INAUDIBLE] going along with

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:57.070
lean thinking, maybe not the
formal process on how much

00:24:57.070 --> 00:25:01.400
the interns and residents
were walking out each day,

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:04.460
going back and forth between
floors, caring for patients,

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.770
and then trying to move towards
a more geographic lean system--

00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:13.660
so things like that that
affected our work [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:17.162
So it was kind of doing some
trials and then going back

00:25:17.162 --> 00:25:18.120
and see if [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.180
EARLL MURMAN: Not
as focused as this.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:20.470
AUDIENCE: Not nearly
as focused as this.

00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.800
It took a long time.

00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.133
EARLL MURMAN: It probably
took a long-- that long, yeah.

00:25:23.133 --> 00:25:24.370
Yeah, Martha?

00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.480
AUDIENCE: I was
just going to say,

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.480
working in a lot of
under-resourced areas,

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.650
the way it really seems to work
in real life is that it's based

00:25:32.650 --> 00:25:37.270
on a branch, or a regulation,
or a staff shortage,

00:25:37.270 --> 00:25:40.550
or a work-around, is how change
happens because it has to.

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:42.290
EARLL MURMAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:42.290 --> 00:25:44.741
AUDIENCE: Catastrophic
event [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:44.741 --> 00:25:47.840
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah, or a
catastrophic event, yeah.

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.330
Laura, what about
the [INAUDIBLE]??

00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:52.080
AUDIENCE: Well, I'm
at the medical school.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:55.580
And I teach a course with
first and second year

00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:56.330
medical students.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.840
And that course, is
constantly evolving.

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.050
So they do a lot of real-time
changing based on feedback.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:05.360
But I'm not so sure
that that's always--

00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:08.570
it was maybe a little bit
too rapid, with not enough--

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:11.072
enough real evaluation
of what's going on.

00:26:11.072 --> 00:26:13.280
EARLL MURMAN: But this is
still a fairly small group?

00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.110
I mean, how many people--

00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:16.550
AUDIENCE: The class is--

00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:21.180
well, there's about 100
students in a class.

00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:24.250
And the class manages both
first and second year class.

00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:28.370
So about 200 students total
are managed in the class.

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.440
And then, when there
are other problems that

00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:32.273
need to be changed, it
does take a long time

00:26:32.273 --> 00:26:34.460
to actually change the
facilitator's manual

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:39.150
to actually institutionalize
some changes.

00:26:39.150 --> 00:26:40.700
So in some ways,
some of the changes

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.370
take place in a rapid fashion,
based on the student input.

00:26:43.370 --> 00:26:46.190
And then some of them,
actually, because the process

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:49.020
has to go through
the dean and whatnot,

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.742
it actually doesn't get done.

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:52.700
EARLL MURMAN: And well,
it sometimes just dies.

00:26:52.700 --> 00:26:53.870
AUDIENCE: It just dies.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:56.520
There's a lot of talk, and
then it kind of fizzles--

00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.020
a lot.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.645
And I even think, in
residency, there's

00:26:58.645 --> 00:27:00.438
a lot of ideas that come out.

00:27:00.438 --> 00:27:01.730
And then they just fizzle away.

00:27:01.730 --> 00:27:05.600
Because nobody has a real
time to actually dedicate

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:07.028
to seeing the process through.

00:27:07.028 --> 00:27:07.820
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:09.080
So you can't do
this for everything.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.150
Because this takes a
real focused application

00:27:11.150 --> 00:27:11.790
of resources.

00:27:11.790 --> 00:27:13.915
So you have to do it for
the most important things.

00:27:13.915 --> 00:27:17.870
AUDIENCE: Dartmouth has a really
complex and wonderful quality

00:27:17.870 --> 00:27:18.830
department.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.630
AUDIENCE: Yes, so the
TDI can handle it.

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:23.742
AUDIENCE: A TDI that can handle
a lot of these kinds of things.

00:27:23.742 --> 00:27:25.700
If you go to them and
with a proposal, and they

00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.825
can put a team together.

00:27:27.825 --> 00:27:28.700
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:31.075
So I'm speaking specifically
about at the medical school,

00:27:31.075 --> 00:27:33.020
what I'm working
with at the hospital.

00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.540
Yeah, the TDI works closely
with Dartmouth Hitchcock.

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.027
And they do a lot of
some lean and some other.

00:27:39.027 --> 00:27:39.860
You would know more.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.290
But they incorporate a lot of
continuous quality improvement,

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:43.790
methods--

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:45.590
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE],,
things that are,

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.100
I mean, for many years,
before they call it lean.

00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:49.850
EARLL MURMAN: We had
an interesting thing.

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:52.370
And I keep drawing on
my health care system,

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.190
because it's my base
of firsthand knowledge.

00:27:55.190 --> 00:27:58.430
But we had an urgent care
clinic and a regular clinic

00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:59.305
in the system.

00:27:59.305 --> 00:28:00.680
And for financial
reasons, it was

00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.520
decided to co-locate them
and physically move them

00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.190
and that they would
share examination rooms.

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:10.850
And these are two groups which
had never worked together.

00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:18.690
And the groups were not happy
about this, this new one.

00:28:18.690 --> 00:28:21.910
So they had a three-day rapid
process improvement workshop.

00:28:21.910 --> 00:28:24.570
And I was fortunate to
go to the final report

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.040
out on the third day.

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:31.570
And the nurse from the
clinic started by saying,

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:33.045
Sunday night--

00:28:33.045 --> 00:28:35.170
the thing started Monday
and finished on Wednesday.

00:28:35.170 --> 00:28:37.090
She said, Sunday
night, I didn't sleep.

00:28:37.090 --> 00:28:39.393
So I came into this
Monday morning just

00:28:39.393 --> 00:28:40.810
knowing this wasn't
going to work,

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:42.340
that the whole thing was
just going to break down,

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.048
and we wouldn't be
able to work together,

00:28:44.048 --> 00:28:47.140
and that there was no way we
could share examination rooms.

00:28:47.140 --> 00:28:52.600
And she came in totally
convinced this wouldn't work.

00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:55.930
By Wednesday afternoon,
she and the staff

00:28:55.930 --> 00:28:58.630
in the urgent care clinic
were the best of friends.

00:28:58.630 --> 00:29:00.560
They had worked through
all their issues.

00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:02.410
She said, this is
just remarkable.

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:03.993
Now, can you imagine
how long it would

00:29:03.993 --> 00:29:06.035
have taken for that to
happen, if they didn't get

00:29:06.035 --> 00:29:08.110
this intense environment,
with the facilitators

00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:09.220
and the objective?

00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.423
It probably would have died.

00:29:11.423 --> 00:29:13.840
Or either that or it would
have been dictated by the CEO--

00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.830
we're going to do
it, in which case,

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:16.840
they would have not had
any ownership in it.

00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.090
And it would have always
been a burr under the saddle.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:23.450
So it's really amazing
how these things work.

00:29:23.450 --> 00:29:25.580
AUDIENCE: I think that
the times that I've really

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:27.236
seen change work
in our department

00:29:27.236 --> 00:29:29.870
is when, unfortunately,
it's mandated.

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:31.880
Because we have a
lot of people who

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:37.040
come with particular interests
and establish relationships,

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.880
people who have decided
not to get along,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.380
people who have decided that
they don't want to collaborate,

00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.970
who have just created their
own separate worlds that

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:46.530
spin in parallel
laws of duplication.

00:29:46.530 --> 00:29:49.435
And it really wasn't until
the chairman of the department

00:29:49.435 --> 00:29:51.560
was sitting at a table in
a meeting that was called

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:54.020
and basically said,
this division of labor

00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:56.720
is unacceptable, and
we all have to change,

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:58.400
that change actually happened.

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.710
And then, once that
mandate was there,

00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:03.070
people decided that they were
going to try to get along.

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:06.530
But unfortunately,
the top-down--

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:08.030
the bottom-up
approach didn't work,

00:30:08.030 --> 00:30:09.745
and it had to be a top-down.

00:30:09.745 --> 00:30:11.120
EARLL MURMAN:
You're lucky you're

00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:13.220
in an organization where
the people eventually

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:14.180
decide to get along.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.597
Because there are a lot of
organizations where people say,

00:30:16.597 --> 00:30:19.620
we'll just wait till
that guy moves on.

00:30:19.620 --> 00:30:21.270
There really is no bonding.

00:30:21.270 --> 00:30:22.770
So you're very
fortunate on that.

00:30:22.770 --> 00:30:23.970
Yeah.

00:30:23.970 --> 00:30:28.080
OK, so anyway, this
is a proven way

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.030
to implement change,
where you've got

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:31.470
multiple stakeholders involved.

00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:33.180
But you've got to do it right.

00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:37.860
And there's a lot of
dynamics going on this week,

00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:41.940
that you have to have
somebody skilled to see.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:46.620
OK, so what we're
going to do is we're

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.590
going to do a mock RPIW
for your next change.

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:53.742
We're going to do this five-day
in about an hour and a half.

00:30:53.742 --> 00:30:55.200
But we're going to
get to the point

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.197
where you're actually going
to implement your new system.

00:30:59.197 --> 00:31:00.780
You'll see in a
minute what management

00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.040
is going to tell you to do.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.983
But we're going to do
it like a mock RPIW.

00:31:04.983 --> 00:31:06.400
The other thing
we're going to do,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.210
which is really not as much
of an enterprise thing,

00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:12.160
is we're going to implement
a daily management system.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:15.160
Now, a daily management
system is an approach

00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:21.170
where-- in this case, one of our
clinics at 7:55 each morning,

00:31:21.170 --> 00:31:25.140
the entire clinic staff
meets for five minutes.

00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.500
And they go over the
status of the clinic

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.880
and what's coming
up for the day.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.350
They have a board prepared.

00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:32.780
This is prepared by the
clinic administrator.

00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:36.200
So it would be like
the scheduling person.

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.733
Here is the previous days--

00:31:37.733 --> 00:31:39.650
just like in the New
Balance chart, basically,

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:41.780
the New Balance thing--
the previous days

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:45.440
by provider, how many people
they were expected to see,

00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:48.390
how many they actually
saw, all the way down.

00:31:48.390 --> 00:31:51.472
And this part is
the upcoming day,

00:31:51.472 --> 00:31:53.930
how many people are scheduled
and how many open spots there

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:54.770
are.

00:31:54.770 --> 00:31:57.020
This is feedback
from the patients.

00:31:57.020 --> 00:31:59.480
This is feedback from
the workforce staff.

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:03.320
I mentioned they track, did
everybody go home on time

00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.430
with no work to do?

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:06.821
If not, why?

00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:09.020
And there's some quality
metrics they track.

00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:12.020
So the clinic administrator
gets this all prepared.

00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:14.720
There's a stopwatch
here somewhere.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:16.910
At 7:55, she
punches a stopwatch.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.050
The meeting starts.

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.597
At 8 o'clock, it goes off,
and the meeting's over.

00:32:20.597 --> 00:32:21.680
It's not really a meeting.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:21.950
It's--

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:22.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] puddles.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:23.965
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:32:23.965 --> 00:32:24.590
I've heard it--

00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:25.772
EARLL MURMAN: Yeah.

00:32:25.772 --> 00:32:27.170
And here's the staff.

00:32:27.170 --> 00:32:30.920
And this gets everybody
in line for the day.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:32.583
And many times,
we'll come out as--

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.500
find out, well, we've
got a patient coming in,

00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:37.400
and we don't have all the
paperwork ready, or something.

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.570
So they get on top of that
right away and get that done.

00:32:42.570 --> 00:32:44.750
So we're going to, I believe--

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.930
am I right?

00:32:46.930 --> 00:32:49.150
See, we're going to try to
implement daily management

00:32:49.150 --> 00:32:50.460
system here, too?

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:51.370
OK.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:58.120
So right now, the people in the
clinic don't see what's coming.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:32:58.930
Right?

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:01.070
Only the scheduler
knows what's coming.

00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:02.380
OK?

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.440
So we didn't know had three
gray bodies coming in.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.610
OK?

00:33:06.610 --> 00:33:09.340
We're going to get that up
where it's very visually

00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:10.900
available to everybody
in the clinic,

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:13.160
and you can track
it in real time.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:17.020
So the wrap-up is
that optimizing lean

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.640
at the local level is
a good place to start.

00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.270
But you can only get so far.

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.802
And the biggest problem
we have right now

00:33:24.802 --> 00:33:27.010
is that some of your patients
aren't getting treated,

00:33:27.010 --> 00:33:29.320
and there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.895
So we need to
solve that problem.

00:33:31.895 --> 00:33:34.270
And I think there are going
to be some other disruptions,

00:33:34.270 --> 00:33:37.590
that management is thinking
about, we have to implement.

RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
--do is talk a bit

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.120
about the politics of regulation
and a bit more about EPA

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.330
and how it works and
how it has worked.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.200
Just by way of why are we doing
this in a course on energy

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.300
policy, an awful
lot of energy policy

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.600
is set by environmental
regulation.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.080
All the-- much of the
discussion of doing

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.890
CO2 controls for climate
change comes down

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.290
to shaping energy policy.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.620
So you really do need to
think about the environmental

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.340
regulation when thinking
about where energy is going

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.160
and where energy
policy is going.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.250
And we'll talk about
a trading regime.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.530
We talked about cap and
trade earlier briefly

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.060
when we talked about
climate change.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.160
We'll talk about it in the
context of SO2 in the case

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.430
you've all read and
subsequent developments,

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.350
and then say a little bit
about generally what the--

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.820
how the regime looks.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.540
It's worth stepping
back a minute just

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.720
to relate to some of
the earlier discussions

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.940
we had about politics
and interest groups.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.950
I like the Wilson piece
because it splits politics

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.620
into recognizable categories.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.390
I had a little
trouble, I confess,

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.810
as a non-political
scientist getting my head

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.460
around Lowy's four categories.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.200
Wilson's are easy.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.430
Who bears the costs?

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.540
Are they concentrated?

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.630
Who bears the benefits?

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.150
Are they concentrated?

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.530
In the case of where the costs
of regulation are concentrated

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.650
and the benefits of
regulation are concentrated,

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:07.620
you get classic interest
group competition.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.390
Cargos between US ports have
to be carried in US ships

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.120
by very long-standing law.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.600
Those rights are regulated
by the-- those US

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.580
flagships wouldn't
exist but for that law.

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.670
This really affects
people who live in Hawaii

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.160
and who get cargos
from the mainland.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.810
There are a small
number of shippers.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.470
There are a small
number of customers.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.750
They're regulated by the
Federal Maritime Commission

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.090
that you've never heard
of, and they care a lot.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.510
And that is the ultimate
inside baseball.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.520
So that's maritime regulation.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.510
Client politics is where the
benefits are concentrated

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.037
and the costs are dispersed.

00:02:50.037 --> 00:02:51.120
And there's a lot of that.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.600
We talked about concentrated
versus dispersed interests,

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.860
milk price supports.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.430
A small number of milk
producers benefit, the costs

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.070
are dispersed among consumers.

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.110
In the old days of
airline regulation,

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.600
it sort of looked like that.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.680
The reverse-- then he
talks about majoritarian,

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.645
where like antitrust, where
you really can't identify

00:03:17.645 --> 00:03:18.770
the benefits and the costs.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.978
They're both quite dispersed.

00:03:19.978 --> 00:03:22.960
The interesting case, and
the case we have today,

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.510
is where the costs
are concentrated

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.250
and the benefits are dispersed.

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.010
And by our earlier
discussions of what

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:36.460
shapes interest group influence,
that shouldn't happen.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.870
And the examples of
that are cases where

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.500
there was a social movement--

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.910
EPA.

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.680
The Food and Drug
Administration came out

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.590
of scandals in the early
part of the last century.

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.470
And you can talk about
a lot of regulation

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.990
that has that
character, but that

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.270
comes from a social movement.

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.450
He calls it
entrepreneurial, and that's

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.570
because usually an entrepreneur
drove the movement.

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.810
So it's useful to think
about sort of where

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.820
the regulation came from.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.690
It's also useful to
think about, who does it?

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.630
Does anybody recall
the types that Wilson

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.579
has of people who work
in regulatory agencies?

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.430
Why would you work in
a regulatory agency?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.970
Yeah.

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.160
AUDIENCE: It's safe [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.710
Like, it's very--
it doesn't oscillate

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.920
as much with the market.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.337
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So you
might make a career out of it.

00:04:33.337 --> 00:04:36.760
You might say, I want to
work in the Food and Drug

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.520
Administration as
opposed to a drug company

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.750
because it's really
safe and it's steady.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.250
OK.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.740
So that's the usual
civil service argument.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.860
Any other reason?

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.360
David?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.777
AUDIENCE: Ideally
because you care

00:04:49.777 --> 00:04:52.030
a lot about the environment
in whatever you're doing.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.170
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
You might care a lot

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:54.355
about what you're doing.

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:56.230
You might care a lot
about what you're doing.

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.300
So you might be a--

00:05:01.597 --> 00:05:04.590
I guess an advocate,
which isn't quite what--

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.200
quite one of his categories.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.080
Anything else you might--
any other reason you might--

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.866
Ryan?

00:05:10.866 --> 00:05:12.570
AUDIENCE: Work with
political leaders.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:13.860
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You
work with political leaders.

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.330
You might have
political ambitions.

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:17.790
It doesn't arise
so much at the EPA,

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.250
but it can arise
in other settings.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.590
You might also-- this is kind
of obscure, but you might--

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.370
why would an economist go to
work for the antitrust division

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.820
in the Department of Justice,
or a lawyer, for that matter?

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.790
To build a professional
reputation and then move out.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.520
So Wilson talks about
careerists, politicians,

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.930
and professionals.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.530
Careerists are those who
really believe in the agency.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:44.250
And they're David's people who--

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:47.010
you work for the EPA because
you care about the environment.

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.200
Politicians want to go
someplace with that,

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.260
make contacts, and move on.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:56.922
And professionals, lawyers,
want to gain status.

00:05:56.922 --> 00:05:58.380
You want to be a
Washington lawyer,

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.530
you work for a Washington
agency, and you get known.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:06.610
Who worked in the EPA early
on, who would you guess?

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.230
David?

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:10.450
Who would work for the
EPA when it starts?

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:14.560
AUDIENCE: People who care a
lot about the environment.

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.290
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That
means, and it's still true,

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.480
that you know how the
EPA thinks as an agency.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.580
EPA favors tight rules.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.455
EPA favors vigorous enforcement
because of the people

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:30.080
who were there.

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.735
Think about the
Department of Energy.

00:06:31.735 --> 00:06:33.860
Why do you go to work for
the Department of Energy?

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.310
Well, you'd like reliable,
abundant supplies of energy.

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:38.390
You care about that.

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:41.270
Maybe you want to move
into the energy industry.

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.890
EPA-- you may want
to move into one

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.060
of the environmental groups.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.830
The Department of
Energy-- you know how

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.710
they think going into the room.

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.590
If you have a meeting with EPA
and energy, as I had many of,

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:54.250
you know.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:55.330
You don't have to
know who they are.

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.747
You know where
they come from, you

00:06:56.747 --> 00:07:00.420
know how they think because
you know why they got there.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.980
One needs to think about this.

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.150
Recall when we talked
about biodiesel at MIT.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:09.390
We talked about what
do those people do?

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:10.410
What is their job?

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.760
What is their responsibility?

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.370
You didn't have to
know them to know

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:16.110
how they'd act in a meeting.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:19.540
You had to know where they sat--

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.290
where they sat.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:24.090
Where you stand depends
on where you sit.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.690
OK.

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.980
Just talking now about
EPA, they do water, toxics

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:31.650
of various kinds, regulation.

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:36.690
Mostly what we care
about here is air.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:40.050
They set national air
quality, ambient air quality

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:43.200
standards for six pollutants--

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.960
ozone particulates,
carbon monoxide,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.620
oxides of nitrogen,
SOx and lead.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:52.440
All of them-- because the
lead came from leaded gasoline

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.830
primarily-- are
driven by energy use.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.670
So those standards
and other regulations

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:00.290
set energy policy, in effect.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.030
The law requires
them to set standards

00:08:07.030 --> 00:08:10.330
to protect human health with
an adequate margin of safety,

00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:12.490
which presumes a threshold.

00:08:12.490 --> 00:08:14.260
People have said for
30 years and more,

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.150
there aren't any thresholds.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.390
The law presumes thresholds.

00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:22.780
As we discussed last
time, they control--

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.630
they review state
implementation plans.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:29.860
The reference to MIT parking
is to remind me to tell you

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.780
that the Massachusetts
state implementation

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.880
plan limits the number of
parking spots MIT can have.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.330
And one of the reasons
there's a large garage

00:08:38.330 --> 00:08:43.049
under this building is that
MIT wasn't using its limit

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:46.430
and was afraid the
limit would be lowered.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:52.010
So state implementation plans
can go into great detail

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:53.315
and are reviewed by the EPA.

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:59.910
We talked about taxes
to limit pollution.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:02.040
EPA has never done that.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.920
They do-- early on they
did very little trading.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.480
We talked about
offsets and so forth.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.800
I'll come back to
that in a second.

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:16.210
Mostly, they set standards.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:21.760
Most regulation is so many
grams of this, per unit of that,

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.100
or use this technology.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.030
The economist's alternative
is put a price on it,

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:35.140
or limit its amount and let
people trade the right to emit.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.280
When might a standard be better?

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.560
Why might a standard be
better in some cases,

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.820
not to be too dogmatic?

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.453
Yep?

00:09:43.453 --> 00:09:45.745
AUDIENCE: Well, standard,
you're-- you leave the option

00:09:45.745 --> 00:09:50.620
for the specific
solution to be localized.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:55.390
So if a specific-- is it all
just setting how exactly how

00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:56.307
they should go about--

00:09:56.307 --> 00:09:57.682
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, that's

00:09:57.682 --> 00:09:59.480
a standard versus a technology.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:03.580
How about a standard
versus a tax or trade?

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:07.360
Because a standard tells
you what you must achieve--

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.203
doesn't necessarily
tell you how.

00:10:10.203 --> 00:10:11.620
That's an interesting
distinction.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.280
Tell me about why you--

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:12.988
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:10:12.988 --> 00:10:17.650
So for example, cap and
trade, you can get--

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.940
when you establish cap and trade
or some sort of taxing, like,

00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:22.750
you can still--

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.630
you're still not going to limit
the amount of pollution, right?

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:30.460
So if for whatever
reason, a specific region

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:32.110
has a lot of credit,
they can still

00:10:32.110 --> 00:10:35.650
overpollute, as long as they
get their qualifications

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.530
in other ways.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:37.030
So I think--

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.250
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
let me just cut you there.

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:41.920
What you're saying
is, it doesn't--

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:45.790
you can have intense
pollution in some areas.

00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:48.490
Now, for carbon dioxide that
isn't going to matter, is it?

00:10:48.490 --> 00:10:50.320
Because it mixes.

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.200
But it might matter
if it doesn't mix.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.080
So suppose you have a pollutant
that basically travels

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.168
50 feet from the plant.

00:10:58.168 --> 00:10:59.710
Then you wouldn't
want to use trading

00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.720
from plants and
widely separated areas

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.130
because you'd have a hotspot.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:03.760
OK.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.567
So standards can
deal with hotspots,

00:11:05.567 --> 00:11:07.150
and that's called
the hotspot problem.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:08.400
You had a comment, Jacqueline?

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.280
AUDIENCE: Is there any
hazardous substances?

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:11.260
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
that's the same issue.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:12.880
Hazardous substances,
you might just--

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.620
if they're really hazardous,
you might want to ban them.

00:11:15.620 --> 00:11:17.698
And if they don't travel--

00:11:17.698 --> 00:11:19.490
all that stuff's
hazardous, to some extent.

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.790
If they don't travel
and they don't mix,

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.650
then you don't want to
say an emission here

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.170
is equivalent to
an emission there.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.470
Lots of emissions here, and none
there is the same thing as none

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.400
there and lots there.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.510
It may not be true.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:34.980
People may live over
here, and not over there.

00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:38.300
So that's the hot spot problem,
where things don't mix.

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:41.360
Any other reason why
you might want to--

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.600
suppose you couldn't
measure emissions very well.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:49.990
Like automobiles-- we don't do
cap and trade for automobiles.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:54.570
Can we measure what comes out
of the tailpipe of your car?

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:56.370
Not real easily.

00:11:56.370 --> 00:12:02.160
We can measure per mile when
you go to get it inspected.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.000
But it's-- aside from
monitoring your driving,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.100
putting a meter
on your tailpipe,

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.990
we couldn't do cap and trade.

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:11.895
We can't measure it.

00:12:11.895 --> 00:12:13.520
So there are enforcement
issues, right?

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:15.590
If I say to the
power plant, you have

00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:17.300
to put this device
on your smokestack,

00:12:17.300 --> 00:12:19.700
and it has to be working
when our inspectors come,

00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.810
that's easy.

00:12:21.810 --> 00:12:23.840
I can go check that.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.170
That's why EPA-- one reason EPA
loves standards, particularly

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:29.190
technology standards.

00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:30.150
Do you have the box?

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:31.590
Is it working?

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:32.610
Easy.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.610
Not, how many tons
did you produce?

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:37.930
Did you run it the
daytime or night?

00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:41.130
So there are enforcement issues,
and there are hotspot issues.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.170
Let me see.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:52.760
Is there anything
else you can think of?

00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.090
Did anybody look at the
Sandel piece that's on it

00:12:55.090 --> 00:12:57.370
and recommended?

00:12:57.370 --> 00:12:58.000
Probably not.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.040
It's late in the semester.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:05.200
Sandel argues that
none of us would

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:08.530
agree that you ought to
be able to buy a license

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.060
to dump garbage in the street.

00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:15.980
So he would say--

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.100
even if we could
do that, we could

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.320
have licenses to just dump
garbage in the street.

00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:28.720
But we'd all sort of
think that's wrong.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.810
If you could buy the right to
dump garbage in the street,

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:34.600
you'd eliminate the stigma.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.520
And if you eliminate the
stigma, you eliminate a force

00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.490
for cleaning up.

00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:43.970
So Sandel would say it's
wrong to do trading because it

00:13:43.970 --> 00:13:47.700
sort of eliminates the stigma.

00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:52.900
Now, carbon dioxide versus
hazardous chemicals--

00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:56.640
you may want to argue whether
a stigma is appropriate

00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:58.170
as we breathe out CO2.

00:13:58.170 --> 00:14:01.830
Maybe that's not such a
terrible thing to be doing.

00:14:01.830 --> 00:14:07.050
But the other issue
you might think about--

00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:18.390
if I can put a device on
the smokestack and I'm done,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:22.240
I get no credit
for doing better.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.370
So I get no credit for beating
a standard if a standard is set.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.690
So there's no
reason to innovate.

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:31.490
If you've told me
that all I have

00:14:31.490 --> 00:14:35.970
to do to comply with the
law is x, then I'm done.

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:40.220
If you tell me it costs $5
a ton every time I emit,

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:45.330
I have a constant incentive to
figure out ways to avoid it.

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.570
So standards ease enforcement.

00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:52.860
They avoid the hot spot problem.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.770
Environmentalists don't
like markets traditionally

00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.610
because they like the stigma,
which I guess would apply--

00:14:59.610 --> 00:15:02.310
I think makes more sense
in the case of toxics

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.690
than in the case of CO2.

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.180
Plenty of people would
like to stigmatize SUVs.

00:15:10.950 --> 00:15:15.750
It raises costs-- may raise
costs, which we talked about.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.030
We'll come back to.

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:21.400
And there's no reward
for innovation.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:25.370
There's no reward for
beating the standard.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.740
OK.

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.740
A little bit about
early trading, which

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:32.310
is in the text assignment.

00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:34.310
Let me just mention this.

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:37.190
This is before 1990.

00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:42.080
Did we have any trading
allowed in the US

00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:43.910
apart from the lead phase-out?

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.410
Well, there were a few.

00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:50.630
Netting says you can
go to your regulator.

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:52.160
You have an oil refinery.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:55.620
Emissions here are regulated and
emissions there are regulated--

00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.680
different parts of
the same factory.

00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:59.180
And you say to the
regulator, look,

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:02.750
I'd really like to emit a little
more here in exchange for a lot

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:06.530
less there, or maybe it's even.

00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:07.670
That's called netting.

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:10.070
It's in the same
internal transactions

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:12.890
or within an entity,
within a plant.

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.850
External transactions
are outside.

00:16:14.850 --> 00:16:17.180
These are inside.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:23.270
They happened,
thousands of them.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.370
Offsets-- I think
we talked about.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:30.230
Offsets are, I'm going
to do more than is

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:31.700
required in my factory--

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:34.190
or less than is
required in my factory,

00:16:34.190 --> 00:16:36.980
in exchange for which he'll
do a lot more than is required

00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.020
in his factory.

00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.330
He'll do more than
he would have done.

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.970
And those are very
complicated negotiations

00:16:44.970 --> 00:16:46.920
that happen in Los
Angeles heavily,

00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:49.530
because you couldn't
build in Los Angeles.

00:16:49.530 --> 00:16:51.960
You couldn't add anything
new in Los Angeles

00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.140
unless you shut something down.

00:16:55.140 --> 00:16:57.680
So if you happen not to
have anything to shut down,

00:16:57.680 --> 00:17:00.090
you did a deal.

00:17:00.090 --> 00:17:02.130
And the local
regulators would either

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:05.940
approve it on the grounds
that you were actually

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.550
reducing emissions over there
more than would have happened

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.319
or they'll disapprove it.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:12.990
Because what the typical thing
is, you take an old factory,

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:16.280
and you pay them to shut down.

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.650
And the regulator would say,
but that's an old factory.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.900
It would have shut down anyway.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.060
So prove to me it
wouldn't have shut down

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.319
if you hadn't paid it.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:28.460
Well, that's either impossible
if the burden of proof

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.000
is set high, or easy
if it's set low.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:37.780
Bubbles are where
you take an area,

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:40.020
and you worry about
emissions within the area.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:41.950
You put a bubble over it.

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:43.420
Some experiments were done.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:45.940
Banking is where
I'll do more than I

00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:48.400
have to today in
exchange for less than I

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.500
have to tomorrow-- very
little of that was done.

00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:55.510
So these are kinds of trading
that the regulators fiddled

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:59.970
with early on, but
not in high volume

00:17:59.970 --> 00:18:05.760
except for netting,
and not much impact.

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:09.460
So let us go to--

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:13.050
oh, one last thing
before I go to the case.

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:17.590
I want to say a little bit about
cost-benefit analysis, just

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:18.340
a very little bit.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:20.430
We talked about it early on.

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:24.570
But it comes up sort of
in the case, sort of.

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:29.370
EPA has to produce a
cost-benefit analysis

00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:32.700
of defending any
regulation at issues.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.740
That's been a
requirement-- really,

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.900
the case talks about the
first sort of instances of it

00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.860
under Carter.

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.890
It's been-- every president
has revised this rule

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:45.440
for executive branch agencies.

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:48.950
Usually, however, the
agencies make a decision

00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:53.320
and then do a cost-benefit to
prove it was a good idea, which

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:54.877
drives other people crazy.

00:18:54.877 --> 00:18:56.710
It's supposed to be
used to make a decision.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.340
It's generally used
to defend a decision.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.050
You never ever have
EPA produce a rule

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.910
and say, well, we have
to produce this rule,

00:19:06.910 --> 00:19:08.890
but in fact, it has no benefits.

00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:12.700
There's always a benefit.

00:19:12.700 --> 00:19:14.950
Some controversies,
some of which

00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:20.470
are mentioned in the text, EPA
having found carbon dioxide

00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:26.650
emissions to be dangerous is
legally obliged to regulate it.

00:19:26.650 --> 00:19:32.120
EPA has issued draft regulations
for new power plants.

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:35.540
Those regulations are being
challenged in court for,

00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:39.110
among other reasons, being
arbitrary and capricious

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.680
because they will
have no benefits.

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:46.010
Regulation of carbon
dioxide from new US power

00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.170
plants in a slow
growth period when

00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:49.850
we're a small part
of the world will

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:52.200
have no detectable benefits.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.700
True fact.

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.520
EPA is legally obliged to
issue a regulation, however.

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.020
It will be very
interesting to see

00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.210
how the court rules
on this one, which

00:20:01.210 --> 00:20:02.760
is now before the DC Circuit.

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.330
There are a set of
controversies about,

00:20:07.330 --> 00:20:09.640
well, when you do a
cost-benefit analysis, what

00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.070
discount rate do you use?

00:20:12.070 --> 00:20:14.470
What do you-- do you
value carbon dioxide

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:16.620
emissions as a cost?

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:20.420
And how do you
value a life saved?

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:24.770
There are White House Office
of Management and Budget

00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:29.060
directives on all of those that
tell agencies how to proceed.

00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:33.370
You could imagine those are the
outcomes of significant fights

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:36.710
within each administration.

00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:41.900
Another significant fight
is the senior discount,

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.650
which the text talks about.

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:48.460
And the way to
think about this one

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:54.310
is, do you count small particles
that are-- small particulates

00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:59.330
that result from
sulfate emissions

00:20:59.330 --> 00:21:04.580
cause acute respiratory episodes
under certain conditions.

00:21:04.580 --> 00:21:09.480
Those tend to kill
elderly people.

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:15.530
So if you value the average
life saved at, say, $6 million,

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:19.253
how do you value the
life of an 85-year-old?

00:21:19.253 --> 00:21:21.170
Some people say, well,
you shouldn't do lives,

00:21:21.170 --> 00:21:23.270
you should do life years.

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:26.180
That 85-year-old is only
expected to live a few years.

00:21:26.180 --> 00:21:27.740
If, in fact, you
killed a teenager,

00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:32.290
you're costing a
lot more life years.

00:21:32.290 --> 00:21:35.860
The EPA discussed this at one
point and proposed to do it.

00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:38.660
That was the senior discount.

00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:41.120
Who votes?

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:43.510
That proposal died.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:45.430
I think most economists
think, although we're

00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:49.840
a little uneasy about this, that
it sort of makes sense to ask,

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.640
are you killing somebody two
weeks early or 50 years early?

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.970
How you want to deal
with that difference

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:03.570
you can argue about for days,
but it sort of seems to matter.

00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:08.310
But the 80-year-old votes,
so the senior discount

00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:14.160
seems to have vanished from
government decision-making.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:21.960
It appears all the time
in academic analysis.

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.350
Contingent valuation--
just one last topic.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:29.820
It's not quite as hot a topic
as it used to used to be.

00:22:29.820 --> 00:22:33.330
When we had the big Exxon
Valdez oil spill in Alaska

00:22:33.330 --> 00:22:41.020
that was notorious, the question
was, what are the damages?

00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:42.900
The damages were
mostly to wildlife

00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:45.030
in the natural environment,
and nobody lived there

00:22:45.030 --> 00:22:46.780
to a first approximation.

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:49.800
So it would be hard to
say that a lot of people

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:51.020
were directly damaged.

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.190
So if you ask-- loss
of fishing revenue,

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:57.720
$6; loss of campsites, $12.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.560
So the following
technique was adopted.

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:06.040
They sent out a survey to
people in the lower 48 states.

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.660
How much would you be willing
to pay to undo the damage caused

00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:11.920
by the Exxon Valdez?

00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:14.910
And then they would
list a bunch of things.

00:23:14.910 --> 00:23:18.330
And you get a really big number
when you ask that question

00:23:18.330 --> 00:23:19.800
and add it up.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.050
Because most people-- a lot
of people will pay zero.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:23.730
That's the most common answer.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:25.980
But among those people
who would pay something,

00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:29.560
a standard answer is $20.

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:36.320
So since it's not real money,
you multiply that across 60,

00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:41.020
70 million people, you get a--
and a few people will put out

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:43.000
$1,000, $2,000, $5,000--

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.370
you'll get hundreds
of millions of dollars

00:23:45.370 --> 00:23:48.330
easily with a
question like that.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:51.350
Does that mean anything?

00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.630
This one was also in court
in a number of cases.

00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:56.300
Does that mean anything?

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.690
One response to it was to
do surveys where they took--

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:03.110
they asked other people
the same kind of question,

00:24:03.110 --> 00:24:06.000
but they doubled the
number of birds killed.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.500
And then they asked other people
the same kind of question--

00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:11.510
they cut the number of
birds killed in half.

00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:14.690
That didn't affect the answers.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.330
We say, oh, maybe
what I'm getting

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:19.483
is general environment
sentiment that has nothing

00:24:19.483 --> 00:24:20.525
to do with this accident.

00:24:23.130 --> 00:24:25.770
But then how do I value the fact
that there was enormous damage

00:24:25.770 --> 00:24:29.970
to natural systems in wildlife
if I can't relate it to people

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:33.100
and the birds don't vote?

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.642
I'd say that remains
an unanswered question.

00:24:35.642 --> 00:24:37.600
This notion of asking
people how much would you

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.600
pay to save a
million birds gives

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.000
answers that seem quite
unreliable, because you

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.800
get the same answer
for 1,000, and you get

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.480
the same answer for 10 million.

00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:48.350
So you say, I don't
know what that means,

00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:51.870
but I don't think
it's a real answer.

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:54.920
But then how do you
value the birds?

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:57.960
So a number of
questions, lots of fun.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:02.670
Let's go to the case.

00:25:02.670 --> 00:25:06.300
We passed the 1970
Clean Air Act amendments

00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:10.530
and instructed EPA to do
a lot of things, including

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.290
the 1971 New Source
Performance Standard

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:15.570
for coal-fired generators.

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:19.470
We talked last time about who
were the interest groups review

00:25:19.470 --> 00:25:20.010
the bidding.

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:23.842
Who was involved in
setting the '71 standard.

00:25:23.842 --> 00:25:25.050
Who were the interest groups?

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:31.260
We did this last time.

00:25:31.260 --> 00:25:32.575
Consult your memory.

00:25:32.575 --> 00:25:34.020
AUDIENCE: Earth Day treehuggers.

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:34.340
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: What?

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:36.215
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Earth Day [INAUDIBLE]..

00:25:36.215 --> 00:25:38.548
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well,
treehuggers were very heavily

00:25:38.548 --> 00:25:41.352
involved getting the act passed,
but you don't hear them much

00:25:41.352 --> 00:25:42.810
mentioned in
connection with making

00:25:42.810 --> 00:25:44.640
this administrative decision.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.570
This was lobbying.

00:25:45.570 --> 00:25:48.210
Who are the lobbyists?

00:25:48.210 --> 00:25:49.420
EPA made the decision.

00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:49.920
Casey?

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.297
AUDIENCE: The utilities
and the coal producers.

00:25:52.297 --> 00:25:53.880
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Were all the coal

00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:55.370
producers in agreement?

00:25:55.370 --> 00:25:56.070
AUDIENCE: No.

00:25:56.070 --> 00:25:58.650
Because eastern coal
has a higher sulfur

00:25:58.650 --> 00:26:00.180
content than western does.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.763
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So you had
eastern coal and western coal,

00:26:02.763 --> 00:26:05.160
and I'm about to lead you
to the next question, which

00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.270
is, why did that make it hard?

00:26:08.270 --> 00:26:12.920
AUDIENCE: Because eastern
coal producers were afraid

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.860
that if EPA put a
standard in place

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:18.330
it required heavy emission
cuts without setting

00:26:18.330 --> 00:26:21.680
a specific technology in
place to achieve those cuts,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:24.336
and people would just switch
to using western coal instead

00:26:24.336 --> 00:26:25.310
of eastern coal.

00:26:25.310 --> 00:26:26.977
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
That's the problem.

00:26:26.977 --> 00:26:30.500
The coal in the US differs
dramatically in sulfur content.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.200
There's a range,
particularly in the East.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.540
It tends to be low in the West.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.980
So if you say, you have to have
low emissions per kilowatt,

00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:41.360
per megawatt hour,
kilowatt hour,

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:44.060
whichever, then
for a lot of people

00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.850
it'll be cheaper to
switch to western coal.

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:52.580
If you say, what you
have to do is scrub--

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:58.760
that is to say, remove
sulfur from the exhaust,

00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.990
then particularly if you say the
percentage you have to remove,

00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:04.820
it may be cheaper
to use eastern coal.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:07.520
And the people in the
west will go nuts.

00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.290
If they're burning
really clean coal

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:13.710
and they have to also clean
the stack, they get angry.

00:27:13.710 --> 00:27:16.470
So you have these two very
clearly opposed interests.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.310
The ones in the east favored
a scrubbing standard.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:25.080
The ones in the west favored
an emissions standard.

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.270
The '71 performance standard
was an emission standard--

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:34.890
1.2 pounds of sulfur dioxide
per million BTU burned, of coal

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.330
burned.

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:41.720
What was the cost-benefit
analysis behind that standard?

00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:43.120
Yeah.

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.525
AUDIENCE: People in the west
can burn their clean coal,

00:27:45.525 --> 00:27:47.580
and they don't have to
do anything with it.

00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.400
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You're
giving me a political answer.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.230
You're not giving
me the cost-benefit.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:53.330
Did they do any cost-benefit?

00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.130
Does the case mention any
analysis of costs or benefit?

00:27:56.130 --> 00:27:57.030
No.

00:27:57.030 --> 00:27:58.700
No, they didn't.

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:00.470
They just kind of
casually-- you're--

00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:02.960
the answer they
gave was, you can

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:05.040
burn most-- you can
scrub most eastern coal

00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.650
and meet that standard.

00:28:06.650 --> 00:28:14.250
That was the thinking, which was
very, very casual, very casual.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.960
This was challenged.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.160
Does anybody recall what the
court challenge was all about?

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.320
Wyatt?

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.087
AUDIENCE: The
Navajo tribe sued--

00:28:23.087 --> 00:28:24.420
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Later case.

00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:25.560
Later case.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.455
The challenge of this one was--

00:28:27.455 --> 00:28:28.830
AUDIENCE: It was
like the sludge.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.870
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: The
sludge challenge, yeah.

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:33.750
That EPA didn't
adequately consider

00:28:33.750 --> 00:28:37.300
sludge that would
result. When you

00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:43.780
take the junk out of the
emissions, you get sludge.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.570
And you've got to treat
that or worry about it.

00:28:46.570 --> 00:28:48.430
And it went back--

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:49.930
they didn't adequately
consider it,

00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:51.860
and it was sent
back to consider it.

00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:55.660
And they considered it,
and didn't change the rule.

00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:58.240
The requirement isn't about
outcome, the requirement's

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.710
about process.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.660
Did you adequately consider?

00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:04.880
That requires somebody to
write something that says,

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.860
here's what they said.

00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.110
Here's what we think about it.

00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:10.090
Here's why it doesn't
change our conclusion.

00:29:10.090 --> 00:29:13.180
You delegate that somewhere
down in the organization.

00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.230
Deal with this.

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:17.440
Write me five pages.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:17.940
OK.

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:21.370
Would you have
done anything else?

00:29:21.370 --> 00:29:22.900
The case makes the
interesting point

00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.450
that EPA was doing
a lot of stuff.

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:27.910
Congress does this all the time.

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:31.150
You set up a new agency, or
you pass a comprehensive law

00:29:31.150 --> 00:29:32.560
like Dodd-Frank.

00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.090
And you say to the agencies, we
need the following 5,000 rules

00:29:37.090 --> 00:29:39.910
issued within 18 months.

00:29:39.910 --> 00:29:43.240
And the agency says,
I've got six people.

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:47.170
And you do what you can, but
you don't spend your lifetime

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:50.470
on this one, because this is
new coal-fired power plants.

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:56.710
We've got this whole problem
with dealing with existing

00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:59.110
sources with SIP plans.

00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:00.340
What's a SIP look like?

00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.903
What are SIP reviews,
State Implementation Plans?

00:30:02.903 --> 00:30:03.820
What's all that about?

00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.350
What are our air
quality standards?

00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.660
And oh, by the way, we've
got to do this thing.

00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:10.420
So they did it pretty casually.

00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.895
Would you-- is it obvious that
there was a better approach?

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.220
Would you have done a
scrubbing standard, Casey?

00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:20.960
I mean, you were--

00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:26.123
AUDIENCE: I think I
probably would not have

00:30:26.123 --> 00:30:27.290
done the scrubbing standard.

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:27.590
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
You probably

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:30.350
would have done what they did
and said, yeah, this is OK.

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:34.430
We'll kick the
can down the road.

00:30:34.430 --> 00:30:35.420
OK.

00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.500
So this cruises.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.810
This cruises along.

00:30:38.810 --> 00:30:42.590
Now, Wyatt, what put
scrubbing on the table?

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:43.970
AUDIENCE: So the Navajos sued.

00:30:43.970 --> 00:30:47.810
And they said if they had
made everybody install

00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:51.680
scrubbing technology, the
people in the Southwest

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:54.410
would still buy the [INAUDIBLE]
coal because it's cheaper

00:30:54.410 --> 00:30:57.183
to ship it, and then that would
overall reduce total emissions.

00:30:57.183 --> 00:30:59.600
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Would
reduce pollution in their area.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.720
They were particularly worried--

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.300
maybe came a little later, but
they were particularly worried

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:07.366
at this point about haze.

00:31:07.366 --> 00:31:08.870
And you still see
it in the West,

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:11.510
that you get a lot more
haze than you used to have.

00:31:11.510 --> 00:31:14.675
And it's not hazardous to human
health, but it's obnoxious.

00:31:14.675 --> 00:31:16.550
Haze in the Grand Canyon
means you just don't

00:31:16.550 --> 00:31:18.020
have those wonderful views.

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.340
So the Navajos sued.

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.660
They lost.

00:31:20.660 --> 00:31:27.070
The environmentalists-- the
other issue was the court.

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:30.100
Some states in the West
that were in full compliance

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.740
submitted state
implementation plans

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.170
that let them get
dirtier, but still

00:31:35.170 --> 00:31:36.940
be in compliance with the law.

00:31:36.940 --> 00:31:39.600
And the courts rejected those.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.700
So what do you do about that?

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.568
Because you'd like to
develop in the West.

00:31:45.568 --> 00:31:46.360
You'd like to grow.

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:47.740
You'd like to build stuff.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:53.140
The court says, even if you're
clean, you can't get dirtier.

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:57.710
And people were installing--

00:31:57.710 --> 00:32:00.650
the air quality
standards were nearby.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:04.000
So one of the ways people were
dealing with sulfur dioxide

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.480
was to build these
monstrously high stacks, which

00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.970
would just let the stuff
diffuse over a wide area.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:15.950
So the standard which is about
concentration wasn't violated.

00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:19.310
The environmentalists were
not happy, to say the least.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.790
That just didn't seem like the
right approach to the problem.

00:32:22.790 --> 00:32:25.490
That's take the dirt,
spread the dirt.

00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:27.080
It's not too dirty
any place, see?

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.790
Same dirt, spread.

00:32:28.790 --> 00:32:33.770
So everybody-- the Navajos
wanted stuff scrubbed.

00:32:33.770 --> 00:32:37.170
The scrubbers were
a potential way

00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.572
of dealing with this
Western states problem.

00:32:39.572 --> 00:32:41.280
There may be other
ways, but in any case,

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:44.160
you had to go-- you
had to reopen the law

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.860
to deal with Western states,
to deal with that court

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.560
decision that basically didn't
let them build anything.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.160
OK.

00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:57.220
Who are the interest
groups here?

00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:02.060
We're in-- we're now in
the process of writing--

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.980
it shouldn't say NSPS, it should
say Clean Air Act legislation.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.720
So we go through
'76, '77 amending--

00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.390
the process of
amending the bill.

00:33:13.390 --> 00:33:15.100
And I left all that
stuff in the case

00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.280
because it's interesting,
I think, to see it once,

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.950
to see the process of
trying to write something.

00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:21.970
It gets passed here.

00:33:21.970 --> 00:33:23.650
It gets rejected there.

00:33:23.650 --> 00:33:24.610
The session ends.

00:33:24.610 --> 00:33:25.720
You start over again.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.700
You try.

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:32.230
Issues get debated
multiple times, often,

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:35.440
before things are
finally passed into law.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.560
And this is an example.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.180
There was the '76 process,
then there was the '77 process.

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.559
Who are the players?

00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:44.040
AUDIENCE: Sierra Club.

00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:44.640
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Sierra Club,

00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:46.350
or the environmental
groups, generally.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.630
Notice they're not
marching in the streets.

00:33:48.630 --> 00:33:50.160
They're lobbying.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.330
So we've sort of seen the
environmental movement

00:33:54.330 --> 00:33:56.730
transformed in
part into something

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.430
that looks more like a
conventional interest group.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.960
They have lawyers.

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.940
The lawyers are in the details.

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:05.550
The lawyers are in the
lobby talking to people.

00:34:05.550 --> 00:34:09.409
They threaten we could have
nine million people write

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:11.159
their congressmen about
this because we're

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:13.175
a grassroots organization.

00:34:13.175 --> 00:34:15.300
So they're a little bit of
a social movement still,

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.860
but they're lobbying.

00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:18.460
Who else?

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.830
Anybody else?

00:34:19.830 --> 00:34:21.310
Environmentalists
wrote that law.

00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.379
Coal producers fell asleep.

00:34:27.379 --> 00:34:29.660
AUDIENCE: So I guess coal
producers in the East

00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:30.487
would be--

00:34:30.487 --> 00:34:31.820
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Both sets--

00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:32.570
East and West.

00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:35.420
I mean, we're now back in play.

00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.880
We're now back in play
worrying about scrubbing,

00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:40.730
worrying about high-sulfur
coal, low-sulfur coal.

00:34:40.730 --> 00:34:44.750
And of course, the people--

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:46.100
well, in the Western states.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:47.120
Also the utilities.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.710
I'm not quite sure why I
put the utilities there--

00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:50.127
I didn't have the
utilities there.

00:34:50.127 --> 00:34:52.100
But the utilities
are also involved

00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.500
because they're going to
bear the cost of all this.

00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:57.240
Scrubbing is not cheap.

00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.630
So the question
of, do you scrub?

00:34:59.630 --> 00:35:00.380
Don't you scrub?

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:03.050
Can you develop in the West?

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:03.550
OK.

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:10.950
Where was the Carter
administration?

00:35:10.950 --> 00:35:11.450
You recall?

00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.080
Yeah, Rory?

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.150
AUDIENCE: They wanted to spend--

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:21.630
solve energy problems, and to
do that easily they couldn't

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:23.790
sidestep the environment.

00:35:23.790 --> 00:35:26.691
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
they were willing to scrub.

00:35:26.691 --> 00:35:29.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:32.210
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So
they wanted to scrub,

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.970
to sell the environmental
movement on the use of coal

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:36.930
for energy security.

00:35:36.930 --> 00:35:39.360
If you made coal too
expensive, people

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.672
were still generating a
lot of power from oil,

00:35:42.672 --> 00:35:44.130
and they really
wanted to move away

00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.510
from oil for security reasons.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:49.550
So, hey, scrubbing costs money,
but it's a security issue.

00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:50.050
OK.

00:35:50.050 --> 00:35:51.800
So you have the Carter
administration kind

00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:53.700
of positioned in favor
of scrubbing, at least

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.290
at the White House.

00:35:55.290 --> 00:35:58.013
You got Eastern coal that loves
scrubbing, Western coal that

00:35:58.013 --> 00:35:58.680
hates scrubbing.

00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:02.200
Environmentalists
have come to love it,

00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.450
because it's now a
technology solution.

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:05.380
It's a standard.

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.840
It's the kind of thing
they tend to like.

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.610
Put the thing on the smokestack.

00:36:09.610 --> 00:36:11.140
Make sure it's running.

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:13.330
That's swell.

00:36:13.330 --> 00:36:15.010
Don't give me any nonsense.

00:36:15.010 --> 00:36:17.740
The Western states say,
well, whatever you do,

00:36:17.740 --> 00:36:19.450
we have to be able to grow.

00:36:19.450 --> 00:36:23.980
We have to be able
to build things

00:36:23.980 --> 00:36:28.120
in pristine areas, at
least some of them.

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:31.770
So what's the final outcome?

00:36:31.770 --> 00:36:35.190
Well, we talk about the
outcome, but who favored it?

00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:36.940
What did we get?

00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.830
We got confused language, right?

00:36:38.830 --> 00:36:42.330
We got confused language
as the final outcome.

00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:48.180
And the confused language, if
you read that, and I actually--

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.820
I did this case out
of a larger piece.

00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.770
I left out a lot of
detail because there--

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:56.010
this also happens.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:37:01.360
Legislation goes to staff, and
you do not see senators at 3:00

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:05.060
in the morning rewriting
details of 1,000-page bills.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:08.250
You see senators giving
instruction to people saying,

00:37:08.250 --> 00:37:11.100
look, the bill has
to get this done.

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:15.210
And so at 3:00 in the morning
over pizza, people are saying,

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.360
well, let me just add this.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.280
And then it goes from
the Senate to the House,

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.050
and somebody in the House
says, no, we can't have that.

00:37:21.050 --> 00:37:22.133
Let me just take that out.

00:37:22.133 --> 00:37:23.180
I'll put this in.

00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.573
And then the bill gets passed.

00:37:24.573 --> 00:37:26.990
And then somebody says, well,
but that doesn't read right,

00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:29.540
so let me make sure
the report on the bill

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:31.770
says what we really mean.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:33.740
And then somebody
else says, no, no, no.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:38.030
So what you got in
this case was confused

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:41.840
language that sort of
seemed to favor scrubbing,

00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:45.800
but was sufficiently
ambiguous to give some leeway.

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:47.950
Who liked that?

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:49.420
Who was in favor of that?

00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.980
Who pushed-- who was happy
at the end of the day?

00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:53.890
Who felt they'd won?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:57.958
AUDIENCE: Western coal?

00:37:57.958 --> 00:38:00.802
Because they weren't
shoehorned into using scrubbing

00:38:00.802 --> 00:38:02.538
they didn't need.

00:38:02.538 --> 00:38:04.580
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Western coal, you're saying?

00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:08.180
Nah, it kind of
favored scrubbing.

00:38:08.180 --> 00:38:10.070
AUDIENCE: The
ambiguity-- ambiguity.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:11.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Oh, the ambiguity.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:11.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:16.790
But they would rather
have had, oh, nothing--

00:38:16.790 --> 00:38:19.940
that it's the administrator's
job to set a standard,

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.890
and the administrator
had done it once

00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.990
and that was a
performance standard.

00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:27.470
This now said the
administrator also has

00:38:27.470 --> 00:38:29.720
to set a percentage removal--

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:32.010
doesn't say it has
to be positive,

00:38:32.010 --> 00:38:35.540
but has to set a percentage
removal, has to consider costs,

00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.610
has to set a
percentage removal, has

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:39.460
to at least look at scrubbing.

00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:41.860
The earlier law didn't say
it had to look at scrubbing.

00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:42.760
Who would like that?

00:38:46.955 --> 00:38:47.455
Yeah.

00:38:47.455 --> 00:38:49.640
AUDIENCE: The utilities,
because [INAUDIBLE]..

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:51.640
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Utilities sort of liked it.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.220
Eastern coal sort of liked
it, because the Eastern coal

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.950
liked anything that
moved toward scrubbing.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:39:02.830
And environmentalists liked it
because it favored scrubbing.

00:39:02.830 --> 00:39:09.770
So that's the interesting
little irony, right?

00:39:09.770 --> 00:39:13.280
I mean, you had
environmentalists

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:19.250
and Eastern coal favoring
the use of a dirty fuel.

00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:20.660
That's an alliance.

00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.670
And the great
quote in the case--

00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:28.100
you almost never hear anything
like this, it's just amazing--

00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:30.710
says, "It made sense for
the dirty coal producers

00:39:30.710 --> 00:39:34.130
to abandon their campaign to
weaken standards and support

00:39:34.130 --> 00:39:36.560
the most expensive possible
clean air solution,

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.780
universal scrubbing,"
which is what they

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.360
thought they got from Congress.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:43.640
They thought they got
universal scrubbing.

00:39:43.640 --> 00:39:46.120
You could read the law that way.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.910
And this is a Sierra
Club-- a lawyer

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:50.560
on behalf of the Sierra Club.

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:56.020
He condemned that 1.2 pound
standard because, quote,

00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.870
"Eastern high-sulfur coal,
which is now available,

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.240
is having a hard time
getting a market because

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.130
of the comparative
cheapness of bringing

00:40:03.130 --> 00:40:06.550
in Western low-sulfur coal."

00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:08.830
Eastern dirty coal
isn't selling well

00:40:08.830 --> 00:40:15.810
because Western clean coal is
cheaper, says the Sierra Club.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:17.670
OK.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:21.150
This is a picture of politics.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:25.230
People are getting what they
can get, building coalitions.

00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:27.990
This is not the Sierra Club
trashing the environment,

00:40:27.990 --> 00:40:31.520
this is the Sierra
Club pushing scrubbing.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:35.160
The Sierra Club wants
scrubbing, and to get

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:39.390
scrubbing they have an alliance
with Eastern coal producers

00:40:39.390 --> 00:40:41.155
who also want scrubbing.

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.412
You might say, gee,
wouldn't the Sierra Club

00:40:46.412 --> 00:40:48.620
serve the environment better
if the Sierra Club said,

00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.728
just tighten the standard.

00:40:51.728 --> 00:40:54.020
Well, they weren't going to
get it because Eastern coal

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.560
producers were too strong.

00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.760
So what they thought they could
get was scrub the dirty coal--

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:07.200
maybe cynical,
maybe not cynical.

00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.060
Was it irrational?

00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:12.660
Well that's-- people jumped
up and down about this.

00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:16.110
What a bizarre alliance.

00:41:16.110 --> 00:41:18.340
The environmental
interest groups,

00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:21.180
arm in arm with the
dirty coal producers.

00:41:24.330 --> 00:41:27.110
Well, they both got
what they wanted--

00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.490
scrubbing.

00:41:28.490 --> 00:41:30.920
Or they thought
they got scrubbing.

00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:33.980
OK, I'll walk a little bit,
just in the interest of time,

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:38.090
through how we got to the New
Source Performance Standard,

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.950
because I want to spend
more time on 1980.

00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:45.455
So what you had in the
administration was a split.

00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:53.850
The air office says, these
guys won in Congress.

00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.400
They went in trying to get
scrubbing, they got scrubbing.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.080
Let's give them a scrubbing.

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.150
We'll set the New Source
performance Standard

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:03.560
as requiring 90% scrubbing.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.980
The economists, always
the heroes of my story,

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:10.730
the Department of Energy, the
planning office in the EPA

00:42:10.730 --> 00:42:13.460
said, why don't we just
tighten the standard?

00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:16.040
The law says we have to
consider a percentage removal.

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.830
We'll make it zero.

00:42:17.830 --> 00:42:21.670
Tighten the standard from
1.2 pounds per million BTU

00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:24.962
to 0.55 pounds per million BTU.

00:42:24.962 --> 00:42:27.450
You do it in the West,
with low-sulfur coal.

00:42:27.450 --> 00:42:28.800
You do it in the East--

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.030
it's a little tough
to do it in the East,

00:42:30.030 --> 00:42:31.697
but we're going to
tighten the standard.

00:42:33.810 --> 00:42:36.117
That's the split within
the administration.

00:42:36.117 --> 00:42:37.950
EPA's rules are reviewed
by the White House.

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:40.290
The Department of Energy
gets to sit at the table.

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.410
Everybody has fun.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:46.560
Would require scrubbing, yes,
but not with Western coal--

00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.600
not much scrubbing
with Western coal.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.060
You could-- some Western coal
you could meet that straight.

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.590
Most of it you'd have to scrub.

00:42:52.590 --> 00:42:57.870
But you wouldn't have to remove
90% of the sulfur to get it.

00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:59.370
How had they shifted?

00:42:59.370 --> 00:43:02.130
Well, this gets interesting.

00:43:02.130 --> 00:43:05.330
The environmentalists could
count the 0.55 standard

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:07.690
as a win.

00:43:07.690 --> 00:43:11.410
So they now didn't much
care about scrubbing.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:14.140
What was on the table now,
both of those were wins.

00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.330
The 0.55 would
probably be cleaner--

00:43:16.330 --> 00:43:19.610
would be cleaner than 1.2.

00:43:19.610 --> 00:43:22.750
So the environmental
movement switched.

00:43:22.750 --> 00:43:27.370
Eastern coal wanted scrubbing.

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.770
The utilities, for some
reason that I don't quite

00:43:29.770 --> 00:43:31.145
understand because
I didn't think

00:43:31.145 --> 00:43:33.430
it was the cheapest
alternative, the utilities

00:43:33.430 --> 00:43:34.930
sided with Eastern coal.

00:43:37.690 --> 00:43:41.800
So you have a switch
when it went from passing

00:43:41.800 --> 00:43:44.790
the law to making the rule.

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:48.570
The environmentalists
switched sides.

00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:50.670
They were allied with the
Eastern coal interests

00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.980
in the legislative process.

00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:55.500
They switched in the
administrative process

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.080
as the agenda changed.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.990
Again, this is not a picture--

00:43:59.990 --> 00:44:02.750
this is kind of a particularly
striking case, which

00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.040
is why it's here, and
it matters for energy,

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.660
which is why it's here.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:10.460
But it's not that unusual
that interest groups switch

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:13.640
sides for tactical reasons.

00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.970
This is-- there's no
religious issue here.

00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:18.530
This isn't pro or anti.

00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.450
This is, how do you get forward?

00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:22.820
They wanted cleaner air
and they wanted scrubbing.

00:44:22.820 --> 00:44:23.540
OK.

00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:25.100
Once you get really
clean air, we'll

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.290
give up on scrubbing, let
the Eastern coal guys go.

00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:34.050
The utilities now have a
distinct point of view.

00:44:34.050 --> 00:44:38.100
The new NSPS, just
to go to it quickly,

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.740
we had a two-tier solution.

00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:46.200
You could either scrub
90% and emit 1.2 pounds,

00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:50.420
or you could scrub 70%
and emit 0.6 pounds.

00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.310
It's a little weird
if you look at it.

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:56.210
Why not just require
these plants to be clean?

00:44:56.210 --> 00:44:58.340
It's a political solution.

00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:02.330
It made Eastern coal
economical in the East,

00:45:02.330 --> 00:45:05.810
and Western coal
economical in the West.

00:45:05.810 --> 00:45:07.850
Nobody's thrilled.

00:45:07.850 --> 00:45:11.990
Not clear that those 70%
scrubbers actually work.

00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:14.330
People have a tendency
to do this in Washington.

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:15.770
They've heard
about a technology.

00:45:15.770 --> 00:45:20.410
They'll require it even if
it's not necessarily proven.

00:45:20.410 --> 00:45:23.050
That's a political-- I
won't press you on that one.

00:45:23.050 --> 00:45:24.760
What would you
have done instead?

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:25.630
Who knows?

00:45:25.630 --> 00:45:27.960
It's a political answer.

00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:29.190
It's a political answer.

00:45:29.190 --> 00:45:30.840
OK.

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.330
Let me go-- after that,
let me pass out the B case.

00:45:36.330 --> 00:45:39.480
New sources under this--
we talked about this--

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.032
under the '70 act and today
have to meet stricter standards

00:45:43.032 --> 00:45:43.740
than old sources.

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:46.560
Old sources have to be
approved by the state.

00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:51.400
There are plenty of really dirty
power plants still running.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:57.390
So by the mid-'80s, this
is called new source bias

00:45:57.390 --> 00:46:00.060
and leads to this wonderful
question on which I spent some

00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:03.360
time in Washington, the outcome
of which I cannot remember

00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.760
because it was so stupid.

00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.830
What changes can you
make to an old plant

00:46:07.830 --> 00:46:10.700
before it becomes a new plant?

00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.220
The Environmental
Protection agency's position

00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.080
was if you replace
a piece of capital

00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:18.440
equipment like, oh, say, a
faucet, it's a new plant.

00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:20.030
It's not the same as it was.

00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:21.020
It's a new plant.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:23.830
It has to meet new
source standards.

00:46:23.830 --> 00:46:25.480
The Department of
Energy's position

00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:28.900
was, well, if there's still
a brick from the old plant,

00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:34.050
it's an old plant as long
as there's something left.

00:46:34.050 --> 00:46:36.480
We reached a compromise
that was challenged in court

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:37.913
by both sides and upheld.

00:46:37.913 --> 00:46:39.330
And I cannot tell
you what it was,

00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:42.030
because that's a question
that has no answer.

00:46:42.030 --> 00:46:43.050
What can you do in old--

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:48.120
that's-- there is no principled
answer to that question.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.310
It's a compromise answer--

00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.300
an enormous waste of time.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:47:00.270
But in any case, so by the
mid-1980s, we had more than 80%

00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:04.470
of the SO2 emitted was
emitted by power plants that

00:47:04.470 --> 00:47:08.300
failed the '71 standard.

00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:12.630
Because people-- and this
is ages of power plants.

00:47:12.630 --> 00:47:15.260
We saw that at the
start of the semester.

00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:16.790
There's an awful
lot of coal fired.

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.010
It's black, for
symbolic reasons--

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:21.770
a whole lot of old
coal-fired plants

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:25.790
put in place before 1970 still.

00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:27.850
There were a lot more in 1985.

00:47:27.850 --> 00:47:31.990
So all this hullabaloo about the
New Source Performance Standard

00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:33.550
isn't actually going to do much.

00:47:33.550 --> 00:47:38.380
You know, you're not huge growth
in capacity here in the '80s.

00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:40.480
It's growing, but not rapidly.

00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:44.920
So nobody-- people want to
extend the lives of old plants.

00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:46.090
The old plants are dirty.

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:48.040
People aren't
building new plants.

00:47:48.040 --> 00:47:52.750
And acid rain gets
to be an issue.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:56.310
So acid rain says, particularly
with high smokestacks--

00:47:56.310 --> 00:47:57.960
the stuff blows
hundreds of miles

00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:02.410
was the argument, and damages
lakes in the Northeast.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:05.780
So what do you do?

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.740
Well, in the '80s, what you
did was debate legislation that

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.640
required old plants to scrub.

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:16.670
And those laws didn't
get anywhere in part

00:48:16.670 --> 00:48:20.600
because the costs
varied so enormously.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:22.495
You have to have land
to put a scrubber in.

00:48:22.495 --> 00:48:23.870
Some plants didn't
have any land.

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:25.792
They just have to shut down.

00:48:25.792 --> 00:48:27.130
Does that make any sense?

00:48:29.307 --> 00:48:30.890
And then the question
was, how are you

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:32.473
going to pay for
this monstrous thing?

00:48:32.473 --> 00:48:36.160
How about we put on a
national electricity tax?

00:48:36.160 --> 00:48:37.940
We didn't burn much
coal in New England,

00:48:37.940 --> 00:48:39.820
so you could imagine the New
England response to that.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:40.320
Let's see.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:42.610
You're going to tax us
so Ohio can clean up.

00:48:42.610 --> 00:48:43.220
Good idea.

00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:43.720
Hmm.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:45.460
No.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:46.870
So the politics were bad.

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.930
And of course, the
Senate Majority leader

00:48:49.930 --> 00:48:53.020
was from a Eastern
coal-producing state,

00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:55.300
and the president
was Ronald Reagan.

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.180
So nothing was going
to pass, and nothing

00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.880
was going to be signed.

00:49:00.880 --> 00:49:06.360
But it was a question to do--

00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.140
what do you do?

00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:11.250
So that case, the B
case, which you have,

00:49:11.250 --> 00:49:14.550
describes the
process that got us

00:49:14.550 --> 00:49:21.280
to the trading position, the
trading provision, title IV,

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:26.690
in the 1990 Clean Air Act.

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:29.870
One environmental group, the
Environmental Defense Fund,

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:32.720
decided the only way we
could deal with this problem

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:35.580
was to put in place
trading, which

00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.310
the environmental movement
had traditionally hated

00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:41.970
because it removed stigma,
license to pollute, trading

00:49:41.970 --> 00:49:45.660
and filth, et cetera,
markets and garbage,

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:48.750
all kinds of great slogans.

00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:52.120
But once they saw there
was no other way to do it,

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:54.840
and we suddenly had a Senate
Majority Leader from Maine who

00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:57.870
cared about acid rain, and
a president who had a summer

00:49:57.870 --> 00:50:00.930
home in Maine who
cared about acid rain,

00:50:00.930 --> 00:50:03.020
we were going to get a bill.

00:50:03.020 --> 00:50:06.810
So this was the way forward.

00:50:06.810 --> 00:50:09.890
It was a wild scramble
for the tradable things.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:11.120
I was involved in this.

00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:15.610
It was horse trading
at its worst,

00:50:15.610 --> 00:50:18.160
but didn't affect
equal marginal costs.

00:50:20.670 --> 00:50:23.400
We talked about national
trading for some pollutants.

00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:25.170
It doesn't make sense
for all pollutants

00:50:25.170 --> 00:50:29.290
because of the hotspot problem.

00:50:29.290 --> 00:50:34.030
But in any case, this law, which
was a national cap and trade

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.980
for sulfur dioxide,
which by the way,

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.620
doesn't mix like carbon dioxide.

00:50:38.620 --> 00:50:41.200
It doesn't mix around the globe.

00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:44.880
It travels maybe a
few hundred miles.

00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:47.010
Sulfur dioxide emitted
in Miami does not

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:49.153
affect the forests
in Maine at all--

00:50:49.153 --> 00:50:51.570
affects the oceans, but doesn't
affect the forest in Maine

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:53.370
directly.

00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:57.570
And sulfur dioxide
emitted in Arizona,

00:50:57.570 --> 00:50:59.610
boy, there may be a few
molecules who get east,

00:50:59.610 --> 00:51:03.060
but not that-- that get
east, not that many.

00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:06.940
So it took effect in 1995.

00:51:06.940 --> 00:51:09.130
So we're now after that B case.

00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:12.400
If you have any questions
about it, about the case,

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:12.952
let me know.

00:51:12.952 --> 00:51:14.410
I've got a bit to
cover, and I want

00:51:14.410 --> 00:51:16.130
to make sure I get it done.

00:51:16.130 --> 00:51:18.000
So here's what happened--

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000
one thing that happened.

00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:25.540
The law created an asset,
this tradable allowance,

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:28.710
and it gave it away.

00:51:28.710 --> 00:51:30.870
Now that's interesting, right?

00:51:30.870 --> 00:51:32.800
That's interesting.

00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.650
It gave away the rights
to emit sulfur dioxide.

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:40.790
Now, if it were a
competitive market--

00:51:40.790 --> 00:51:44.150
let's suppose it took
one of those things

00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:47.930
to generate a megawatt
of electricity.

00:51:47.930 --> 00:51:51.590
Then you'd expect the
price of electricity

00:51:51.590 --> 00:51:56.440
to rise by the cost of an
allowance on opportunity cost,

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.090
on an opportunity cost basis.

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:01.030
If you give it to me for free,
but if I don't use it myself

00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:02.390
I can sell it--

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:05.350
so the cost of using it is
the price on the market,

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:07.890
even though I got it for free.

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:11.400
So what you would expect
is in a competitive market,

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.620
it's a gift.

00:52:14.620 --> 00:52:18.310
In a regulated market,
it's not so clear.

00:52:18.310 --> 00:52:21.220
And states had different
ways of dealing with this.

00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.610
This picture illustrates
sort of the distinction

00:52:24.610 --> 00:52:28.810
between the value
of the allowances

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:32.530
and the cost of cleanup,
which is often a confusion.

00:52:32.530 --> 00:52:37.090
So we have allowances
to emit sulfur dioxide.

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.550
Each one gives you the
right to emit a ton.

00:52:39.550 --> 00:52:42.210
There's a demand for those.

00:52:42.210 --> 00:52:43.680
What's the demand determined by?

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:47.760
Well, it is determined by the
marginal cost of cleaning up.

00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.680
If this is what I would emit--

00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:52.740
this is what the industry
would emit if there

00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:54.750
were no price on allowances.

00:52:54.750 --> 00:52:58.950
And this is what they emit
when the price is higher.

00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:04.020
This curve must reflect the
marginal cost of cleanup.

00:53:04.020 --> 00:53:08.340
Because you will emit
until the cost of cleanup

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.260
exceeds the costs or the--

00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:13.050
you'll clean up until
the cost of cleanup

00:53:13.050 --> 00:53:15.360
exceeds the value
of an allowance

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:16.360
because I have a choice.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:19.740
I can reduce emissions
or buy an allowance.

00:53:19.740 --> 00:53:24.870
So the area-- if this is the
cap, the area under the curve

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:27.760
to here, and if
this is the price,

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:31.510
this area must be
the cost of cleanup.

00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:34.840
Just like the demand for a good
is the marginal value consumers

00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:38.260
place on it, here the marginal
value is the cost of cleanup.

00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:41.650
So the cost-- the area under
this curve from here to here

00:53:41.650 --> 00:53:43.210
is the cost.

00:53:43.210 --> 00:53:51.000
This rent is the value of the
allowances that were given out.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.140
Now, if this were a
competitive, unregulated market,

00:53:56.140 --> 00:53:59.410
and that picture were right--

00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:02.380
well, I don't have the rest of
the story so I can't say that.

00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:07.272
Normally, however, it's a gift.

00:54:07.272 --> 00:54:08.730
You probably haven't
followed this,

00:54:08.730 --> 00:54:13.290
but there's a controversy about
the European carbon trading

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:17.250
system is now being expanded
to include airlines, which

00:54:17.250 --> 00:54:23.940
requires airlines flying
into Europe to buy allowances

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:27.380
to cover the carbon
they emit flying in.

00:54:27.380 --> 00:54:32.080
Airlines, including US airlines,
are being given allowances.

00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.540
Not enough, but they're
being given allowances

00:54:34.540 --> 00:54:37.590
to cover most of
their emissions.

00:54:37.590 --> 00:54:41.450
The US airlines are
berserk about this.

00:54:41.450 --> 00:54:44.510
The administration is
berserk about this.

00:54:44.510 --> 00:54:47.090
You're taxing our people.

00:54:47.090 --> 00:54:50.540
The analysis done
over in Building E19

00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:55.290
concludes very persuasively that
the US airlines will, in fact,

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:59.960
make money because they're being
given almost enough allowances,

00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:02.240
and the price of
airline fares is

00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:05.390
going to go up to cover
the opportunity cost--

00:55:05.390 --> 00:55:09.500
not the out-of-pocket
cost, the opportunity cost.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.890
Even if I've been given it,
the cost of using it to me

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.830
is the market price.

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:18.740
The price I charge will
have to cover that.

00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.750
My profits will go up.

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:23.830
US airlines hate this analysis.

00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:25.240
They paid for it.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:28.170
They now reject it
as fatally flawed.

00:55:28.170 --> 00:55:31.560
It is, if you think about it
for a little while, pretty

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:37.770
simple economics, a little more
complicated under regulation.

00:55:37.770 --> 00:55:39.290
So what else happened?

00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:41.630
Question on this?

00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:42.130
OK.

00:55:42.130 --> 00:55:43.210
What else happened?

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:45.820
Well, this is the
pretty picture.

00:55:45.820 --> 00:55:49.030
These were-- this was actual
emissions, US emissions

00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.930
in millions of tons.

00:55:49.930 --> 00:55:54.610
These were-- you can estimate
that pretty well by the fuel

00:55:54.610 --> 00:55:55.390
they burned.

00:55:55.390 --> 00:55:58.170
After 1995, they had
monitors on the stack,

00:55:58.170 --> 00:55:59.620
so we know it for sure.

00:55:59.620 --> 00:56:02.830
Here's the cap, this line here.

00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:04.960
It went down over time.

00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.140
It's a little complicated
because more units were

00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:10.080
covered, which is one reason--

00:56:10.080 --> 00:56:13.800
a lot of things happened,
but this is the aggregate cap

00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.910
pretty clearly.

00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:16.530
These are some
estimates of what might

00:56:16.530 --> 00:56:18.450
have happened absent the law.

00:56:18.450 --> 00:56:22.890
The law was passed
in 1990, but there

00:56:22.890 --> 00:56:26.970
was some anticipation of it
and some investments made.

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:29.130
But the key thing
is in the oval.

00:56:29.130 --> 00:56:31.970
Look at what happened
to emissions.

00:56:31.970 --> 00:56:34.820
Environmental programs
don't do that.

00:56:34.820 --> 00:56:36.050
People litigate.

00:56:36.050 --> 00:56:36.890
They resist.

00:56:36.890 --> 00:56:38.930
The devices don't work.

00:56:38.930 --> 00:56:39.770
Look at that drop.

00:56:39.770 --> 00:56:41.600
It dropped below the cap--

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:45.550
way below the cap.

00:56:45.550 --> 00:56:48.502
Why did that happen
do you think?

00:56:48.502 --> 00:56:50.710
Well, I'll give you the--
yeah, go ahead, Jacqueline.

00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:51.880
AUDIENCE: Was it banking?

00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:52.810
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It was banking.

00:56:52.810 --> 00:56:53.440
Exactly.

00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:54.970
There was banking.

00:56:54.970 --> 00:56:59.290
The cap gets pretty low out here
around 2,000 A lot of people

00:56:59.290 --> 00:57:01.900
said, all right, I'm
going to look to 2,000.

00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.460
I'm going to overcontrol.

00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.980
I'm going to do more
than I need to do now,

00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:09.700
so that when I come here,
I can notice emissions

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:10.780
are above the cap here.

00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.560
I can draw down the bank.

00:57:13.560 --> 00:57:14.290
I can draw down.

00:57:14.290 --> 00:57:15.165
And that makes sense?

00:57:15.165 --> 00:57:17.100
Yeah, it probably made sense.

00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:19.230
Because you got early
emissions reductions.

00:57:19.230 --> 00:57:21.720
You got early control.

00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:23.400
Cumulative emissions
were the same.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:27.260
Eventually, the
bank is exhausted.

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:31.580
The other thing you saw,
this business about always

00:57:31.580 --> 00:57:33.230
having an incentive to cut.

00:57:33.230 --> 00:57:36.410
The incentive to cut
here was the value

00:57:36.410 --> 00:57:39.747
of the banked
allowance later on.

00:57:39.747 --> 00:57:41.330
The other thing that
happened that you

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:45.458
wouldn't have had happen in
standards is people innovated.

00:57:45.458 --> 00:57:48.000
Well, you know how I'm talking
about burning high-sulfur coal

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.550
and burning low-sulfur coal.

00:57:49.550 --> 00:57:51.180
People say, wait a minute.

00:57:51.180 --> 00:57:53.660
High-sulfur coal
is now really cheap

00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.270
because it's really dirty.

00:57:56.270 --> 00:57:58.830
But I can mix it.

00:57:58.830 --> 00:58:02.280
It's not a trivial thing to
do, but it's not that hard.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.130
People figured out
how to blend it in,

00:58:05.130 --> 00:58:09.450
which lowered their costs while
still keeping under allowances.

00:58:09.450 --> 00:58:12.270
People invented
new ways to scrub.

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:16.880
Didn't remove 90%,
but were lots cheaper.

00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:18.400
People did a variety of things.

00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:22.210
Railroad deregulation
brought Western coal east.

00:58:22.210 --> 00:58:26.030
So we had this huge
reduction in emissions,

00:58:26.030 --> 00:58:29.060
and you saw it on the ground.

00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:31.130
Now, it turns out acid
rain wasn't as damaging

00:58:31.130 --> 00:58:33.560
as people thought.

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:37.880
There was a large study
funded on impact of acid rain.

00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:40.460
It wasn't finished before
the bill was passed--

00:58:40.460 --> 00:58:42.140
hey.

00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:46.910
But in terms of deposition,
you saw a great reduction

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:48.380
in the Northeast--

00:58:48.380 --> 00:58:51.290
still some hot
spots, but nothing

00:58:51.290 --> 00:58:53.810
like what they were before.

00:58:53.810 --> 00:58:57.270
This was why the fiction worked.

00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:59.670
It was going to be
cheapest to control in here

00:58:59.670 --> 00:59:01.920
and everybody knew it.

00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:06.860
So if you had-- even if you
had a national regime, and yes,

00:59:06.860 --> 00:59:08.075
you could control down here.

00:59:08.075 --> 00:59:09.200
You can control over there.

00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:10.490
You can control up here.

00:59:10.490 --> 00:59:14.400
It was going to be cheapest
to make reductions here.

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:17.400
And so that's where they
were going to get made.

00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.730
All the models said that.

00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:23.370
Everybody was very
quiet about the fact

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:25.830
that this stuff doesn't mix.

00:59:25.830 --> 00:59:27.960
Because the models
were pretty clear

00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.300
that we're going
to get what we want

00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:32.580
because here's where
it's cheap, and here's

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:35.000
where we want the cuts made.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.670
But the different-- but
the point to keep in mind

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.000
is even in these regions,
the costs of control

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.800
differed enormously
among plants.

00:59:43.800 --> 00:59:46.620
So yeah, regionally
it's cheapest in there,

00:59:46.620 --> 00:59:49.070
but not plant by plant.

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:50.970
So trading worked.

00:59:50.970 --> 00:59:53.420
It got it where it was cheapest,
and where it was cheapest

00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:56.780
was where we wanted it.

00:59:56.780 --> 00:59:59.530
This is the price.

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:02.350
These are the price
of these rights

01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:07.540
to emit a ton running
through the end of 2003.

01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:10.030
The initial estimates
were higher.

01:00:10.030 --> 01:00:13.390
The initial estimates
were about $300 a ton.

01:00:13.390 --> 01:00:20.350
So some mixture of innovation
and cheap Western coal

01:00:20.350 --> 01:00:21.460
held the price down.

01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.580
But you will notice the
price bounces around.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.553
People were making a living
trading these things.

01:00:27.553 --> 01:00:28.720
How could you make a living?

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.750
Well, why did they bounce?

01:00:30.750 --> 01:00:34.600
Well, if you think about
it for just a minute,

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.640
it's sort of like
we talked about oil.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.590
There's a demand for emissions.

01:00:38.590 --> 01:00:40.660
It depends on the economy.

01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:42.220
It depends on coal prices.

01:00:42.220 --> 01:00:43.700
It depends on a lot of things.

01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:47.510
But in the short run,
it's pretty inelastic--

01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:49.700
short run, a few months.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:53.900
You don't change a coal
plant in a few months.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:56.030
The supply curve is
that vertical line.

01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:57.650
It's a cap.

01:00:57.650 --> 01:00:59.960
So the supply is
really inelastic,

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:04.210
the demand is pretty inelastic,
and the price bounces.

01:01:04.210 --> 01:01:07.000
So if you look at it,
you say, well, all right.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.790
The price moved from,
say, $75 to $200

01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:12.380
over a period of a few years--

01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.190
terrible, horrible.

01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:15.260
Oh, by the way, there
were speculators.

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:16.710
Of course there
were speculators.

01:01:16.710 --> 01:01:19.360
How could there
not be speculators?

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:20.750
Did the speculators do this?

01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:22.610
Not really.

01:01:22.610 --> 01:01:25.010
They may have amplified,
but the main story

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:27.020
was inelastic demand
and inelastic supply.

01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:35.520
Industry hated this,
as you could imagine.

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:39.450
Not such a big deal for sulfur
because it's a small cost,

01:01:39.450 --> 01:01:41.280
but makes it hard
to plan when you

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:44.310
don't know within
a factor of three

01:01:44.310 --> 01:01:47.850
what that cost is going to be.

01:01:47.850 --> 01:01:49.680
The alternative--
and I will say we

01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.300
were asked a lot,
those of us who

01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:56.860
were involved in doing this
thing, why didn't you do a tax?

01:01:56.860 --> 01:02:01.130
Tax would avoid that
kind of uncertainty.

01:02:01.130 --> 01:02:04.340
You buy-- the government
would buy or sell.

01:02:04.340 --> 01:02:06.170
You just put it-- in effect.

01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:09.770
You just put a tax
on SO2 emissions.

01:02:09.770 --> 01:02:13.030
Wouldn't that be better?

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:14.650
Yes and no.

01:02:14.650 --> 01:02:16.150
It would mean there was a risk--

01:02:16.150 --> 01:02:19.750
the risk would transfer, as
you can see, to quantity.

01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:22.570
The environmentalists
hated that.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:26.120
You don't know how much
is going to be emitted?

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:29.210
Rather not know the price.

01:02:29.210 --> 01:02:33.710
And the utilities
really hated it

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:37.890
because instead of being
given these rights,

01:02:37.890 --> 01:02:41.260
you'd actually have
to pay out of pocket.

01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:42.010
No, no, no.

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:43.960
No, no, no, no, no.

01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:47.550
So that was a non-starter.

01:02:47.550 --> 01:02:49.445
That was a nonstarter.

01:02:49.445 --> 01:02:49.945
OK.

01:02:52.850 --> 01:02:54.530
Let us now go--

01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:55.790
I think this is where we go--

01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:00.250
to the C case.

01:03:00.250 --> 01:03:04.470
So what the C case
tells us is the game

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:07.980
shifted in the early '90s.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:09.500
People worried less
about acid rain,

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.980
and they worried a lot more
about small, fine particulates.

01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:17.420
Began to get
epidemiological studies

01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:19.340
that said that fine
particulates kill people.

01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:24.350
Mostly they kill old
people, but old people vote.

01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:27.900
So EPA had to--

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:34.310
EPA issued a standard for
fine particulates in 1997,

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:39.770
and it had to figure out how to
meet that standard, the problem

01:03:39.770 --> 01:03:43.460
being the acid rain problem
in different clothing.

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:48.020
Small particulates are caused
by SO2, among other things,

01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.850
and thus, they travel.

01:03:49.850 --> 01:03:52.010
In effect, they travel.

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:55.670
So EPA, which has
interstate authority,

01:03:55.670 --> 01:04:01.470
had to do something
about fine particulates.

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:06.920
So what it tried to do
was brilliant in a way.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:10.680
It said, we'll tighten
the acid rain program.

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.130
How do we tighten the
acid rain program?

01:04:13.130 --> 01:04:18.110
We require I think it was two
allowances to be emitted now

01:04:18.110 --> 01:04:23.190
for every ton instead
of one allowance.

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:24.330
How perfect is that?

01:04:24.330 --> 01:04:27.300
We just cut the ceiling--
cut the cap in half.

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:29.250
Surely that's going
to reduce emissions

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:32.550
enough to cut these
particulates way back.

01:04:32.550 --> 01:04:34.500
Well, here's what
happened to prices.

01:04:37.050 --> 01:04:38.370
Yeah.

01:04:38.370 --> 01:04:42.960
What I showed you early
on, ran up to about there.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:47.430
This drastic tightening
was being debated.

01:04:47.430 --> 01:04:51.870
And that must be somebody
cornering the market,

01:04:51.870 --> 01:04:53.130
but run-up--

01:04:53.130 --> 01:04:53.710
or trying to.

01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:58.770
But the run-up to the shoulders
was fear of this regulation.

01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:05.000
So again, if you
read the C case,

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.680
this was a brilliant idea to
keep the trading system intact,

01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:13.640
to make it deal with the new
problem by tightening it.

01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:16.940
If you want to read-- oh, I
didn't put the citation in.

01:05:16.940 --> 01:05:19.670
If you want to read
something really depressing,

01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:23.540
read the circuit
court opinion that

01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:30.790
dealt with the maybe 40 people
who challenged this rule.

01:05:30.790 --> 01:05:33.310
Hundreds of reasons
why you couldn't

01:05:33.310 --> 01:05:35.620
do this, why it was
arbitrary and capricious

01:05:35.620 --> 01:05:37.750
and an abuse of discretion.

01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:41.590
And what the court
did was throw it out.

01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:44.440
And by throwing it out, threw
out the acid rain program.

01:05:47.010 --> 01:05:49.650
You see the little
quotation there.

01:05:49.650 --> 01:05:52.530
It said, "Sources in
Alabama which contribute

01:05:52.530 --> 01:05:55.380
to nonattainment of the
fine particulate standard

01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:57.540
in Davidson County,
North Carolina

01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.180
would not need to reduce
their emissions at all."

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.130
They could just buy
the right to emit.

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:04.980
"Therefore, they could keep
contributing to nonattainment

01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.080
in North Carolina.

01:06:07.080 --> 01:06:10.710
Therefore, a rule that
allows that is invalid."

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:14.460
It doesn't solve the
North Carolina problem.

01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:18.230
You've got to come up
with something that does.

01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:20.840
And what EPA has come up
with and what's in process

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:24.380
is something that basically
eliminates interstate trading.

01:06:27.110 --> 01:06:31.830
So this is the short happy
life of interstate trading

01:06:31.830 --> 01:06:35.280
of sulfur dioxide allowances.

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:37.050
It worked.

01:06:37.050 --> 01:06:38.760
It didn't in the
eyes of the court

01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:44.850
solve the next problem that
came along, but it worked.

01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:48.300
So let me say a little bit
generally about the Clean Air

01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:52.770
Act from some EPA propaganda.

01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:54.240
Stepping back from
this program--

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:56.070
and I'll let you
digest this stuff,

01:06:56.070 --> 01:06:58.740
and we'll have a few
minutes for questions.

01:06:58.740 --> 01:07:02.670
If you look over the long
term, from 1970 to 2005,

01:07:02.670 --> 01:07:04.440
real GDP almost doubled.

01:07:04.440 --> 01:07:07.740
Vehicle miles traveled
almost doubled.

01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:10.380
Lead emissions went
almost to zero.

01:07:10.380 --> 01:07:11.230
Well, that was easy.

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:12.870
We phased lead out of gasoline.

01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:14.730
That was a good trick.

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:18.220
But large particulates
went down by 83%,

01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:22.100
but the small
particulates not so much.

01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:26.360
So this problem
is still with us.

01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:28.040
The small particulates
turn out--

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.000
the big ones you see.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.490
The small ones kill
you, as a shorthand.

01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:35.120
Carbon monoxide is down
better more than half.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:39.900
Sulfur dioxide is down half.

01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:42.600
Oxides of-- these are national
emissions, not concentrations.

01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.580
Oxides of nitrogen-- 30%.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:48.240
That's stubborn because you
get it from automobiles,

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:51.300
and you got that doubling
of vehicle miles traveled.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:54.240
But still down a third.

01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:58.540
Volatile organics down 52%, and
that's catalytic converters.

01:07:58.540 --> 01:07:59.850
So if you look at that--

01:07:59.850 --> 01:08:02.820
again, if you look at that
relative to that paper that

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:06.840
was so pessimistic about
environmental progress,

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:08.010
that's not bad.

01:08:08.010 --> 01:08:10.230
If you hadn't had EPA,
it would have been worse.

01:08:10.230 --> 01:08:11.772
Most of this stuff
would have gone up

01:08:11.772 --> 01:08:14.520
with GDP or vehicle
miles traveled.

01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:15.495
Not great.

01:08:15.495 --> 01:08:17.350
Not great.

01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:21.609
You still have ozone, which
involves small particulates--

01:08:21.609 --> 01:08:27.529
stubborn, stubborn-- the
Eastern Seaboard, and of course,

01:08:27.529 --> 01:08:30.620
Southern California.

01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:36.043
But you'll notice Cape Cod
is a nonattainment for ozone,

01:08:36.043 --> 01:08:37.460
not because of the
terrible things

01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:38.880
they do there, because it moves.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:39.380
Yeah?

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:41.410
AUDIENCE: What's a
random [INAUDIBLE]??

01:08:41.410 --> 01:08:43.010
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
The random what?

01:08:43.010 --> 01:08:45.783
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:08:45.783 --> 01:08:46.700
AUDIENCE: In Colorado.

01:08:46.700 --> 01:08:48.075
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
In Colorado?

01:08:48.075 --> 01:08:49.750
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:49.750 --> 01:08:54.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: That, I
believe, is carbon monoxide,

01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:00.022
and it has to do with
automobiles I think.

01:09:00.022 --> 01:09:01.064
I don't think it's ozone.

01:09:01.064 --> 01:09:03.050
AUDIENCE: Is there an
Air Force base there?

01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:04.717
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
No, no, no, no, no.

01:09:04.717 --> 01:09:05.750
This is Denver.

01:09:05.750 --> 01:09:07.010
This is Denver.

01:09:07.010 --> 01:09:09.080
Do you have a clue what that is?

01:09:09.080 --> 01:09:12.260
I know there was some there
was some issues with fuel

01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:14.430
formulation there in particular.

01:09:14.430 --> 01:09:16.211
So I think it's a--

01:09:16.211 --> 01:09:20.075
it is a-- I think it's an ozone
or a carbon monoxide problem.

01:09:24.170 --> 01:09:25.234
I could be wrong.

01:09:25.234 --> 01:09:26.359
But there are people there.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:27.540
There are people there.

01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:29.240
It's not just skiing.

01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.490
Skiing's farther west.

01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:34.490
So there are parts of the
country where the air still

01:09:34.490 --> 01:09:37.279
counts as dirty.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:43.040
And that's ozone and other
criteria pollutants are, again,

01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.560
in some places.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:52.130
You've got the-- well, some
of these are quite unpleasant.

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:54.600
Southern-- not unpleasant,
but Southern California,

01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.380
for instance, persists,
as for that matter,

01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:01.400
does the Pittsburgh
area in nonattainment

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.900
for a number of pollutants.

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.530
So let me pause there.

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:09.420
That's a lot of ground to
cover and I rushed through it.

01:10:09.420 --> 01:10:15.020
So let me see if you have
questions on any of it.

01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:15.800
Oh, yes.

01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.300
AUDIENCE: Can you
go back one slide?

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.633
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Absolutely.

01:10:18.633 --> 01:10:19.280
That's easy.

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.065
AUDIENCE: So in California,
like, along the border

01:10:22.065 --> 01:10:23.990
of California and
Nevada, it looks

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:27.770
like pretty much all of
that border in California

01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:28.430
is really bad.

01:10:28.430 --> 01:10:31.970
But then in Nevada it's
only at the southern tip.

01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:34.530
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I think
what you have here is--

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:39.120
is this maybe Imperial
County, which is gigantic?

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.350
So it may be that the
problem is over here.

01:10:43.350 --> 01:10:44.747
So it's being done by county.

01:10:44.747 --> 01:10:46.580
It's being done-- there's
certain monitoring

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:47.990
stations in each county.

01:10:47.990 --> 01:10:51.050
And my guess is Death
Valley is probably

01:10:51.050 --> 01:10:53.810
not a nonattainment
area for much.

01:10:53.810 --> 01:10:57.032
But over here near
LA, I'm guessing.

01:10:57.032 --> 01:10:58.240
AUDIENCE: Part of the county.

01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:58.790
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:59.060
Yeah.

01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.518
It's a certain
number of monitoring

01:11:00.518 --> 01:11:02.730
stations sort of thing.

01:11:02.730 --> 01:11:03.230
Yeah.

01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:04.562
AUDIENCE: Can you [INAUDIBLE]?

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:11.420
Like, what would happen if you
had like a quantity control

01:11:11.420 --> 01:11:15.447
up to, say, 80% of the
cap and then set a tax?

01:11:15.447 --> 01:11:16.530
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Sure.

01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:17.030
Sure.

01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:18.830
You could even do
better than that.

01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:21.200
Let me get there.

01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.500
Yeah, here.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:25.670
Oh, or here, but rather here.

01:11:25.670 --> 01:11:29.600
What people did talk about
in the context of CO2--

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.780
so we talked about there
was a cap and trade bill.

01:11:32.780 --> 01:11:35.060
And environmentalists
said, well,

01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:37.670
the price could get so low there
wouldn't be any incentives.

01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:39.230
And industry said,
the price could

01:11:39.230 --> 01:11:41.390
be so high it would kill us.

01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:43.940
If we had sudden
economic growth,

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:46.880
we could get really high prices
that would choke off growth.

01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:48.530
Or if the growth
was slow, you could

01:11:48.530 --> 01:11:50.405
have what you have in
Europe, which is really

01:11:50.405 --> 01:11:52.350
slow prices, really low prices.

01:11:52.350 --> 01:11:58.930
So people proposed, how about
we have a floor and a ceiling?

01:11:58.930 --> 01:12:02.920
The floor would be if the
price drops below this floor,

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:06.620
some agency starts buying
these things on the market.

01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:08.680
If the price gets
above the ceiling,

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:11.080
we start selling them
at the ceiling price.

01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.060
So you stand ready to
buy at the floor price

01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:16.315
and sell at the ceiling price
to limit the fluctuations.

01:12:16.315 --> 01:12:18.190
And if the floor and
ceiling are close enough

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:21.840
together it looks like a tax.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:25.980
So that was a serious
set of proposals

01:12:25.980 --> 01:12:28.890
in the climate context
for exactly the reasons I

01:12:28.890 --> 01:12:30.300
think you're thinking of.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:35.010
Too low removes incentives;
too high is very expensive.

01:12:35.010 --> 01:12:38.010
You give up quantity
control, but you give up

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:41.340
quantity control
sort of at the edges.

01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:46.690
If growth is really slow, then
emissions are going to be low.

01:12:46.690 --> 01:12:48.840
The problem is up here,
if growth is really fast,

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:51.420
you're going to let
emissions grow some.

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:54.610
So maybe you want this curve
to be steep up here, a supply

01:12:54.610 --> 01:12:55.110
curve.

01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:56.880
But you could-- there
are very-- there

01:12:56.880 --> 01:13:00.030
are ways to combine these two
and variations on a theme.

01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:01.340
Yeah.

01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:04.300
Anything else?

01:13:04.300 --> 01:13:05.850
OK.

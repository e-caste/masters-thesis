00:00:21.371 --> 00:00:23.570
DENNIS FREEMAN: OK.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.730
So last time, the idea was to
think through a different way,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.030
or in fact, several
different ways,

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.460
to think about
discrete-time systems.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.820
Today is a crash course to do
the same thing in CT systems.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.860
So last time, for
the last week, we've

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.440
been looking at different
kinds of representations

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.170
for DT systems.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.640
Difference equations, because
they're concise and precise.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.090
Block diagrams, because they
let us visualize the signal flow

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.426
paths.

00:00:57.426 --> 00:00:59.300
And operator expressions,
because it lets you

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.940
treat systems like polynomials.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.450
What we'll see today is that
that same kind of strategy

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.980
works precisely.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.740
The strategy, not the answers.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.730
The same strategy
works precisely for CT.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.490
We'll have a concise,
precise representation

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.740
in terms of differential
equations, which I'm sure you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.370
already know all about.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.890
But we will also develop the
notion of a block diagram

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.220
so you can visualize
signal flow paths.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.340
And we'll have an analogous
operator, the A operator,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.620
that will let us treat the
systems as polynomials.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.710
So that's the overview.

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.170
Because it's so
similar, we'll be

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.510
able to do all of
this in one lecture.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.990
So that's what I mean
by a crash course.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.660
So this is Introduction
to CT in 50 minutes.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.690
So you already know a lot about
how you'd represent systems

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.130
as differential equations.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.370
You've seen this
in other classes.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.710
You should have seen this
sort of approach in physics.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.012
You should have seen this sort
of approach in math, in 1803.

00:02:05.012 --> 00:02:06.470
So we're to assume
that you already

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.334
know how to think about
differential equations.

00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:11.000
And what we're going
to do is skip ahead

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.650
and think about the alternative
representations instead.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.160
So just like in DT,
where we thought

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.400
about block diagrams,
which gave us

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.360
a way of thinking about
signal flow paths,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.305
we'll have the same
sort of idea in CT.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.530
The big difference,
you can anticipate.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.620
I mean, if the CT [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.180
In the difference equation,
the fundamental operation

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.590
in the difference equation
was a delay operation.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.380
If you contrast
that to a CT system,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.960
a fundamental
operation is not delay.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.760
You know from 1803,
you know for physics,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.040
you know from lots
of other exposures,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.130
that the fundamental
operation is differentiation.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.750
And so the blocks will not
be built out of delays,

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.160
but will instead be
built out of integrators.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.050
Apart from, that the
block diagram structure

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.480
looks extremely similar.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.990
And we'll be able to apply
the same idea that we

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.090
did in DT, to simplify the
representation of the block

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.820
diagram by thinking
in terms of operators.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.180
The operator has to
similarly change.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.620
So the new operator,
the operator

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.830
that we use to
represent a CT system,

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.260
we'll call the A operator, A is
intended to mean accumulator.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.130
The thing that's in my mind
when I say the A operator

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.200
is this tank.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.680
This tank accumulates water.

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.510
And you can think
about the relationship

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.870
between the height of the water,
and the input and output rates

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.630
by some differential equation.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.070
But the point is that the
tank itself, the system,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.330
accumulates.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.370
And that's what we want
to have in our heads

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.430
when we think about
the A operator.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.650
So the operator is going
to be like the r operator.

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.830
You will apply the r operator
to a discrete time signal

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.320
to generate a new
discrete time signal

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.970
that we shifted to the right.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.510
That's what r
meant, r was right.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.800
So right shift operator.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.190
Here, you apply the A
operator to the X signal.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.560
X is now CT, continuous time.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.520
And when you apply the A
operator to a signal X,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.950
it generates a
whole new signal Y

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.550
that is everywhere equal
to the indefinite integral

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.050
of the input signal.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.016
So the A operator is, start
with the input signal X.

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:46.640
And integrate it with regard to
time starting at minus infinity

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:52.220
and going up to t, that's the
t value of the output signal.

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.470
Simple.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.000
So let's see how simple.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.350
So here's a bunch of block
diagrams written in terms of A.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.110
Here's a bunch of
differential equations.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.400
Figure out the
correspondence, if any.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.920
OK, traditionally, it seems
that people are quiet.

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.430
So before you start, say
something that has nothing

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.350
to do with 003 to you
next-door neighbor.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.710
It has to have nothing
to do with 003.

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:28.100
And then figure out which of
these bottom diagrams, number

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.335
1, 2, 3, 4, or none
of them, corresponds

00:05:30.335 --> 00:05:31.460
best to the correspondence.

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.314
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.098
OK, you've got 30 seconds
to answer the question, now.

00:06:31.098 --> 00:06:34.570
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.166
Well, that killed everything.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.090
OK, everybody raise
your hand and tell me

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.390
which of the five available
answers, 1 through 5,

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:52.562
best illustrates
the correspondence.

00:07:52.562 --> 00:07:53.270
Raise your hands.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.460
Let me see how many
of you figured it out.

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.640
Remember, if you're wrong, you
can blame it on your partner.

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.107
OK, it's more than 95% correct.

00:08:03.107 --> 00:08:04.190
How do you think about it?

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:04.981
What do I do first?

00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:09.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.120
DENNIS FREEMAN:
[INAUDIBLE] So what do

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.564
you want me to look at first?

00:08:12.564 --> 00:08:13.730
This diagram, that equation?

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.896
This diagram, that equation?

00:08:14.896 --> 00:08:16.676
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:16.676 --> 00:08:18.050
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Write an equation

00:08:18.050 --> 00:08:19.091
for each of the diagrams.

00:08:19.091 --> 00:08:22.016
How would I figure out an
equation for that diagram?

00:08:22.016 --> 00:08:22.516
[INAUDIBLE]

00:08:22.516 --> 00:08:26.019
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:26.019 --> 00:08:28.560
DENNIS FREEMAN: So what's coming
in and out of the plus sign.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.390
That's very good .

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:31.520
So let's focus on [?
that ?] coming out first.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:31.640
Us.

00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:32.931
What's the name of that signal?

00:08:35.797 --> 00:08:37.231
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:39.612
DENNIS FREEMAN: Well, I
can think of two names.

00:08:39.612 --> 00:08:41.070
That's why it's a
good idea to look

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.310
at what's coming in and out.

00:08:44.310 --> 00:08:46.950
One way that I could name
this would be with reference

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:49.232
to the A operator.

00:08:49.232 --> 00:08:51.190
If I know that what comes
out of the A operator

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:54.660
is capital Y, what goes
into the A operator?

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:58.860
DENNIS FREEMAN: The derivative.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.850
So if I know that what comes
out is Y, then what goes in

00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:02.740
must have been Y dot.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.540
But that [? also ?] has to
be the output of the adder.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.682
So what were the two
inputs to the adder?

00:09:10.682 --> 00:09:12.155
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:12.155 --> 00:09:13.265
DENNIS FREEMAN: X and--

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.780
py.

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:24.160
So y dot, the thing that
goes into the accumulator,

00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:26.860
has to be the same as X plus py.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:29.230
So y dot is X plus py, so
there's a correspondence

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.980
between these two.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.240
Everybody sort of get the idea?

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.970
We can do the same
sort of thing here.

00:09:36.970 --> 00:09:38.261
What's the name of that signal?

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:43.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:44.770
DENNIS FREEMAN: [? Shout. ?]

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.910
AUDIENCE: Y dot over p.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.140
DENNIS FREEMAN: y dot over p.

00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:48.639
Exactly.

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:51.410
So that one is going
to be y dot over p.

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:56.030
And that's going to have
to be the same as x plus y.

00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:58.500
So if you clear
the fraction here,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:00.507
you would find that
y dot is px plus py.

00:10:00.507 --> 00:10:02.090
So there is a
correspondence that way.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.107
And you can do the same
sort of thing down here.

00:10:10.107 --> 00:10:11.440
It looks a little bit different.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:11.940
What's this?

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.930
This says that the output
of the adder, y, the output

00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.240
of the adder here is y.

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.640
So y must have been x plus what?

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:27.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:33.710
DENNIS FREEMAN: So p
times the integral of y.

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:36.300
And I'd like to write that
in a differential form,

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.900
so I could differentiate
term by term

00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.560
to say that that's the
same thing as y dot is

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.040
x dot plus py.

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:48.190
So y dot is x dot
plus py, so there's

00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:49.190
correspondence that way.

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:50.491
So the answer is 1.

00:10:50.491 --> 00:10:50.990
OK?

00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:53.180
Everybody's happy
with them that?

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:57.220
So the point is that the
differential operators

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.427
look very much the same.

00:10:58.427 --> 00:11:00.010
You can use the same
kind of reasoning

00:11:00.010 --> 00:11:03.460
that you did for difference
equations with r.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.490
Of course, the
operators are different.

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.050
And just like r, you can
think about these things

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:13.070
as polynomials.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:16.780
So if you think about this
feedforward system that's

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.840
now CT, not DT, the
feedforward system

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:25.870
says that I can construct W by
taking X plus A X, X plus A X,

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:31.310
where that's X plus
the the integral of X.

00:11:31.310 --> 00:11:33.310
Then I could think
about the Y signal

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:38.350
as W plus the integral
of W. So that's this one,

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:40.420
y is the w plus the integral w.

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:43.945
And now I can substitute
instances of this into here.

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.690
So this w expression
could go in there.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:50.990
And that gives me this.

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:53.529
If I integrated this
w expression once,

00:11:53.529 --> 00:11:55.070
then I would get
the integral of that

00:11:55.070 --> 00:11:58.940
plus the double integral of
that, so that gives me these.

00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.540
And I think about those things
in terms of A's, and I get

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:06.260
precisely the same expression.

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.010
So the idea is,
just like r, you can

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:14.050
manipulate operator
expressions in r,

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:15.670
like they were polynomials.

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:21.750
You can manipulate
operator expressions in A,

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:24.720
just like they were polynomials.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.260
And the reason I can say that
is that, if I think through all

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:30.540
the properties of
polynomials, I can draw

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:34.080
an isomorphism between the way
the system would have behaved

00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.310
and the way the polynomial
would have behaved.

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:39.210
And in particular,
here's three statements

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.230
that have to be true.

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:43.940
If the operator
expressions were supposed

00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.610
to behave like
polynomials, polynomials

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:51.470
have the property that
the polynomials in A

00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:53.600
should commute.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.567
Polynomials should
have the-- the A

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:57.150
should have the
distributive property,

00:12:57.150 --> 00:13:00.560
multiplication over addition.

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.530
And polynomials
should associate.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:07.000
And if you think about
each of those in detail,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.800
the operations that
would correspond

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.650
to what you've put
in the block diagram

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.740
have precisely those
same relations.

00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.751
So that's the outline of how
you go about proving something

00:13:17.751 --> 00:13:18.250
like this.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.220
But the takeaway message
is the operator expressions

00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:28.740
in A obey all the rules that you
would expect from a polynomial.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:32.720
So, second question.

00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.640
Think about these two
systems, and think

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:35.960
about the notion of equivalent.

00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:41.150
Equivalent here is going to be
just the same as it was in DT.

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:45.590
In DT, equivalent [? man,
?] if all of the right shift

00:13:45.590 --> 00:13:49.970
operators started at rest, that
is to say their output was 0,

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.660
we will have the same
kind of notion here.

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.050
At rest is going to mean
all of the integrators--

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.750
integrators have a starting
value, an initial value.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.880
If those initial
values are all, 0 then

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:03.890
we say that the system
started at rest.

00:14:03.890 --> 00:14:05.570
We have that same
kind of proviso.

00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:08.960
Given that proviso,
then all of the operator

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.160
expressions behave
like polynomials.

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.350
So determine k1 so that these
two systems are equivalent,

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.500
given that definition
of equivalence.

00:14:19.500 --> 00:17:02.000
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.490
So anyone have an answer?

00:17:04.490 --> 00:17:06.410
So how should I choose
k1 if I want those two

00:17:06.410 --> 00:17:07.940
systems to be equivalent?

00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:10.460
Yes?

00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:11.250
Raise your hands.

00:17:15.714 --> 00:17:18.711
OK, it was a trick question.

00:17:18.711 --> 00:17:21.210
So now, given the additional
information that it was a trick

00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:24.839
question, revise your answers.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.369
Ah excellent, excellent.

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:27.329
Instant revisions.

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:28.230
Wonderful.

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:31.300
OK, what was the trick?

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:33.215
[INAUDIBLE] got it.

00:17:33.215 --> 00:17:35.494
What was a trick?

00:17:35.494 --> 00:17:35.994
Yeah.

00:17:35.994 --> 00:17:37.892
AUDIENCE: It would be minus 1.6.

00:17:37.892 --> 00:17:40.070
DENNIS FREEMAN: It should
have been minus 1.6.

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:41.210
Yes.

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:44.062
So what do you do?

00:17:44.062 --> 00:17:46.520
What do I do first in order to
answer a question like this?

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:52.350
[INAUDIBLE]

00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:54.352
[? Right, ?] so translate
the block diagrams

00:17:54.352 --> 00:17:55.560
into a differential equation.

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.030
That's a good approach.

00:17:57.030 --> 00:17:59.880
Because what we'd like to do
is figure out an equivalence.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.780
The equivalence is not trivial.

00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:05.390
So in fact, the
equivalence is easier

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:08.240
to think about if
you do polynomials.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.490
You could try to
manipulate the blocks

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.380
to make them look the same.

00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:14.630
That's actually hard.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:16.170
It it's pretty easy
to do it if you

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:25.410
think about the block diagrams
being represented as operators.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:28.290
So you can look at the first
one and you can say, OK.

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:34.815
W is the signal that comes out
of A operating on an X minus

00:18:34.815 --> 00:18:36.670
0.7W.

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:38.430
So that's what
that's adder says.

00:18:42.030 --> 00:18:44.020
And you can similarly
do this box.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.150
It looks the same.

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:47.490
Treat them as polynomials
and you can reduce it

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:48.630
to some equivalent form.

00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:54.490
Does everybody have the
gist of what's going on?

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:55.440
Same thing down here.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.700
The equations look a
little bit different.

00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:58.912
But it's the same idea.

00:18:58.912 --> 00:19:00.870
You figure out what are
the constraints imposed

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.520
by the blocks.

00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.230
The output of every A
has to be the integral

00:19:05.230 --> 00:19:06.729
of the thing that went into it.

00:19:06.729 --> 00:19:09.270
The output of every adder has
to be the sum of the two things

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.115
that went into it.

00:19:10.115 --> 00:19:11.490
Figure out all
those constraints,

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:15.060
reduce them to polynomials,
and then manipulate them

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:17.250
as though they were polynomials.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.250
And the polynomial manipulation
shows that minus k1

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:21.720
should be 1.6, OK?

00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.490
[INAUDIBLE] should
be a minus 1.6.

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:26.280
Point is, it's easy.

00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.170
If you know polynomials,
you know the answer.

00:19:28.170 --> 00:19:29.580
That's pretty good.

00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:31.650
So we're doing something
completely different

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.450
from polynomials.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:35.820
But we're able to
use the intuitions

00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:39.960
that we get from polynomials
in order to do the problem.

00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.920
There is one remaining problem.

00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:46.650
Something that is
harder than it is in DT.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:49.200
Probably the hardest part of CT.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.240
And that involves
thinking about what

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:54.930
should be our basis signals.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:57.420
In DT, there is a
really good candidate

00:19:57.420 --> 00:20:02.010
for that, which we call
the unit sample single.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:05.920
The unit sample signal
is the simplest possible

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.730
non-trivial DT signal.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.752
By which I mean it is 0
everywhere, except one place.

00:20:12.752 --> 00:20:14.835
If it were 0 everywhere,
we would call it trivial.

00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.630
So in order for it
not to be trivial,

00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:22.354
it has to be non-zero
at least some place.

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:23.395
The place is non-trivial.

00:20:23.395 --> 00:20:27.360
It is at n equals 0.

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:32.290
And the value that it is,
given that it can't be 0, is 1.

00:20:32.290 --> 00:20:38.740
So the unit sample signal is
the most simple non-trivial DT

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.582
signal.

00:20:39.582 --> 00:20:41.290
So what we need is
the equivalent for CT.

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.120
So here it is.

00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:50.650
Define a signal in CT that
is 0 everywhere except 0.

00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:56.150
And at 0, make it [? 1. ?]

00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:58.910
So is that a good choice?

00:20:58.910 --> 00:21:02.750
And I hope I've
biased my presentation

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:07.070
enough so that the
answer is obviously no.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:10.240
So the real question
is, why not?

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.250
Can somebody think
of a good reason

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:15.201
why this is a poor choice
for a building block signal?

00:21:15.201 --> 00:21:15.700
Yes.

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:22.364
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:22.364 --> 00:21:25.480
DENNIS FREEMAN: So you
would need infinite gain

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.310
to go from 0 to 1.

00:21:27.310 --> 00:21:30.370
That's sort of true
for the r thing, too.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.726
You have to go from 0 to 1.

00:21:33.726 --> 00:21:35.260
It's in 0 time.

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:37.114
That seems hard.

00:21:37.114 --> 00:21:37.780
Any other ideas?

00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:37.850
Yeah.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:38.725
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:38.725 --> 00:21:41.630
DENNIS FREEMAN: Not continuous.

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:43.988
That's also true.

00:21:43.988 --> 00:21:44.906
Yes.

00:21:44.906 --> 00:21:47.172
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:21:47.172 --> 00:21:48.880
DENNIS FREEMAN: The
integral is always 0.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.860
That's a problem.

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:57.700
So it's just not going to
be a very useful signal.

00:21:57.700 --> 00:21:58.880
OK, what am I doing?

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.440
I'm trying to figure out
a basis signal that I

00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:03.640
would use in block diagrams.

00:22:03.640 --> 00:22:07.050
My basic block diagram
is this integrator thing.

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:11.920
Mine is infinity to t on tau.

00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:14.496
So I'd like to put
something in here.

00:22:14.496 --> 00:22:16.370
But if I put that signal,
what did I call it?

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.930
W. If I put W into
an iterator, what's

00:22:19.930 --> 00:22:23.830
the output of the integrator
after you integrate W?

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:24.760
0.

00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.260
Well, that's a problem.

00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.150
It's not a very
good basis function

00:22:28.150 --> 00:22:33.010
if the very first operator I
go through turns it into 0.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.480
Everyone see that?

00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.970
That's a problem.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.820
This is the problem in CT.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:42.840
If you guys figure out the
next slide, you're done.

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:44.800
CT's easy.

00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:52.250
So what we do is think
about defining a signal that

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:55.580
would have the property
that it behaved as though it

00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.377
had those desirable properties.

00:22:57.377 --> 00:22:58.460
What would have to happen?

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:01.830
We'd like a signal that
had some amount of area.

00:23:01.830 --> 00:23:03.320
Because that's
what this thing is.

00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:06.390
This is an area operator.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.570
We would like a signal
that didn't have a 0 area.

00:23:09.570 --> 00:23:11.460
The W signal has 0 area.

00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:13.410
Bad.

00:23:13.410 --> 00:23:15.960
We'd like a signal that
doesn't have zero area.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.560
In fact, if we wanted it to
be the simplest possible,

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:22.820
then you should
have an area of 1.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:27.010
But we'd like it to be
zero almost everywhere.

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:29.380
How do you do that?

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.560
OK, well, the way you can do
it, and the way we will do it,

00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:37.720
is think about building a
signal [? with ?] a limit.

00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:40.900
What if I had a
pulse signal that

00:23:40.900 --> 00:23:44.470
was 2 epsilon wide and
1 over 2 epsilon high?

00:23:44.470 --> 00:23:49.330
The area would be 1, regardless
of the value of epsilon.

00:23:49.330 --> 00:23:56.507
And if I shrunk epsilon to be
a very small number, say 0,

00:23:56.507 --> 00:23:58.090
if I think about the
limit, as epsilon

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.610
gets smaller and smaller
and smaller and smaller,

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:05.410
then I approach the
condition I'd like to have.

00:24:05.410 --> 00:24:08.440
The signal is 0
everywhere, except 0.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.610
Now, it has a
horrendous value at 0.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:13.510
But, oh well, I'll sweep
that under the rug.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.030
The important thing is
that, when I integrate it,

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.920
I'd like it to give me one.

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:20.062
That's the important thing.

00:24:20.062 --> 00:24:20.770
Everyone with me?

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.895
That's the hardest part in
this part of the course.

00:24:22.895 --> 00:24:26.530
If you get this, CT
systems are a breeze.

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:30.880
So this is a different
kind of a signal.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:35.600
The idea is to incorporate in
it two seemingly contradictory

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.100
things.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:43.440
It should be 0 almost everywhere
and the integral should be 1.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:46.110
So there is no such thing.

00:24:46.110 --> 00:24:48.125
This is an idealized signal.

00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:50.250
This is something that we
think about in the limit.

00:24:50.250 --> 00:24:52.740
It turns out that we
can get a lot of insight

00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.650
by thinking about this signal.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:58.680
But it is important to
realize that it is only

00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:01.540
defined in a limit.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.110
So we will write it.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:06.800
Since it's so useful, we
will write it this way.

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:08.430
We'll draw a little arrow.

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:10.530
The arrow is supposed
to connote in your mind,

00:25:10.530 --> 00:25:13.490
this thing goes really high.

00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:16.890
It goes so high that telling you
how high it is is meaningless.

00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:21.892
So instead, to the side, we
tell you what's the area of it.

00:25:21.892 --> 00:25:23.600
What would come out
if you integrated it?

00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.100
Yes.

00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
DT [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.800
decompose an [INAUDIBLE]
signal into a series

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.342
of [INAUDIBLE] Can you do the
same thing with [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:32.342 --> 00:25:33.175
DENNIS FREEMAN: Yes.

00:25:33.175 --> 00:25:35.770
And that will be something
that we spend a lot of time on,

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.060
because that decomposition
is not trivial.

00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:42.700
But it is possible.

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.720
So the question was, can we
decompose arbitrary signals

00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.220
into sums of these things?

00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.450
And the answer is
absolutely yes.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:54.720
That's why we like it.

00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.930
OK, so the first
thing to think about

00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:00.760
is what happens if
you put, now, instead

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:09.274
of W, let's put delta of t,
the unit impulse function.

00:26:09.274 --> 00:26:10.940
What happens if you
put the unit impulse

00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:13.770
function into an integrator?

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:19.500
Well, if you integrate the delta
of t, so if my input x of t

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:25.180
is delta of t, and if I
want to think about y of t,

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.370
which is going to
A operating on x?

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:32.430
So think about what would be
the answer to this integral

00:26:32.430 --> 00:26:34.544
for times less than 0?

00:26:34.544 --> 00:26:36.710
Well, the system started
the rest and the integrator

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.050
turned on at 0.

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:43.190
What's the value of the
answer of the integrator here?

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.810
0.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:46.690
It started at 0 back at
minus infinity some time.

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:48.610
Started at rest.

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:51.340
There was no input.

00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.240
So the answer is 0.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:56.920
So the answer is going to be
0 up until something happens.

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:02.230
During that brief epsilon of
time, a unit of area went in.

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:06.540
So what's the output of
the integrator become?

00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.310
1.

00:27:08.310 --> 00:27:10.020
So at that time it became 1.

00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:16.880
And then what's the value
as you go forward in time?

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.170
1.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:20.220
It got stuck at 1.

00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.650
So the most primitive signal
that we'll think about

00:27:24.650 --> 00:27:26.020
is the unit impulse function.

00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:29.226
We'll denote that by delta of t.

00:27:29.226 --> 00:27:31.850
And it has the property that it
goes through our most primitive

00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:33.810
block.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:35.970
Delta goes to a
unit-step And unit-step

00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:38.670
is so useful that we'll give
it a special name, u of t.

00:27:38.670 --> 00:27:40.462
U means unit-step.

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.380
And with that, all
of these systems

00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.740
now make sense, in the same
sense that DT systems did.

00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:55.750
So for example, if I have
a feedforward system,

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:59.680
I can think about that as
having several signal flow

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:02.250
paths going forward.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.020
And the output of
the signal, when

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:08.460
stimulated with
a delta function,

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:10.380
is the sum of all
those different signal

00:28:10.380 --> 00:28:12.970
paths that I can think of.

00:28:12.970 --> 00:28:15.630
So I can express the
input-output relationship

00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:18.840
by dysfunctional relationship.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:21.287
Everybody sees that?

00:28:21.287 --> 00:28:23.370
Or I can just think about
all the different signal

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:24.330
flow passed through here.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.371
What would happen if I
had a delta function here?

00:28:26.371 --> 00:28:28.420
Well, here's a signal flow path.

00:28:28.420 --> 00:28:29.530
Here's another one.

00:28:29.530 --> 00:28:32.030
Here's another one.

00:28:32.030 --> 00:28:33.710
Here's one.

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:36.350
For signal flow
paths, I have to think

00:28:36.350 --> 00:28:39.136
about ways the input could
turn into the output.

00:28:39.136 --> 00:28:40.760
If the input went
through the top half,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:44.630
the output would be delta.

00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:52.520
If the input went through, the
path the output would be u.

00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:58.000
If the input went
through this path, u.

00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.707
If the input went through
this, it turns into u,

00:29:01.707 --> 00:29:03.790
and then it goes through
another accumulator, what

00:29:03.790 --> 00:29:06.730
happens when you integrate u?

00:29:06.730 --> 00:29:07.230
tu.

00:29:10.670 --> 00:29:17.732
If this is u, and if you put
that in through an integrator,

00:29:17.732 --> 00:29:19.690
that integrator, like
all the other integrators

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.900
we'll talk about, unless
we tell you otherwise,

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.930
is initially at rest.

00:29:22.930 --> 00:29:25.870
Therefore, the
output started at 0.

00:29:25.870 --> 00:29:27.850
Because u is 0
for t less than 0,

00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:32.700
it persists at 0 until
something happens at t equals 0.

00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:34.200
At which point, the
input becomes 1,

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.520
and the integral of 1 is t.

00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:42.730
So we will usually write that
this way, meaning it's t.

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:45.700
So we will write as
a shorthand times u.

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.620
That's a strange thing to do.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.254
It's just very convenient.

00:29:50.254 --> 00:29:51.670
It's convenient,
because normally,

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:57.370
when you have a function, so
that last function, this one,

00:29:57.370 --> 00:30:00.400
is a signal that does this.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:07.150
So we will call that tu
of t because, obviously, t

00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:08.940
is that signal.

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:10.040
We don't mean that.

00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:13.740
We want to lop off the
part that came before 0.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:15.320
Multiplying by u
of t is a quick way

00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.710
of writing lop off the
stuff that came before 0.

00:30:18.710 --> 00:30:20.510
That's all that means.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:23.186
So we'll write that that way.

00:30:23.186 --> 00:30:25.310
And you can see that, by
thinking about signal flow

00:30:25.310 --> 00:30:28.790
paths, and by thinking about how
this basic signal, this basis

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:30.920
function, goes
through the system,

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:34.130
it's easy to figure out the
response of such a system.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:42.670
Just like in DT,
feedback is different.

00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.880
So now, we have to think
about what would happen

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.140
if there's a feedback loop.

00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:48.660
So it was crucial,
when I was doing

00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:54.060
this kind of an illustration,
that it was feedforward only.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:58.260
I could decompose all
of the signal flow paths

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:01.240
into a finite number
of forward-going paths.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.150
This is harder.

00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:06.610
This happened in DT, too.

00:31:06.610 --> 00:31:09.040
We had to figure out how the
DT system was going to work

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.390
when we had a feedback path.

00:31:10.390 --> 00:31:11.860
And it was more
complicated, and we

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.720
had to fall back
on thinking about

00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:16.515
sample-by-sample propagation of
the signal through the system.

00:31:16.515 --> 00:31:17.890
And we'll do the
same thing here.

00:31:20.530 --> 00:31:23.430
In order to figure out how
to think about signal flow

00:31:23.430 --> 00:31:29.220
through such a diagram, through
a diagram that has feedback,

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.912
we'll think about
falling back to 1803.

00:31:32.912 --> 00:31:33.870
Something we can trust.

00:31:33.870 --> 00:31:36.750
Something we all loved.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:37.560
Nod your heads yes.

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.720
Make me-- reassures me.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.340
Fond memories of 1803.

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:44.910
So it's pretty simple
to think about how

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:50.020
you would solve that system by
using an 1803 type of approach.

00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:52.040
Convert the system into
a differential equation.

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.206
We've already done that one.

00:31:56.050 --> 00:32:00.250
Then from the form, we will
usually, in this class,

00:32:00.250 --> 00:32:04.490
use the general method of
solving differential equations,

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.451
which is--

00:32:06.451 --> 00:32:11.050
What's the general method for
solving differential equations?

00:32:11.050 --> 00:32:13.410
They may not have
told you in 1803.

00:32:13.410 --> 00:32:17.110
What's the general method of
solving differential equations?

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.820
Guess!

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.430
Yes.

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:23.260
So the general method is guess.

00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:27.450
If you can guess, plug it in
and it works, you're done.

00:32:27.450 --> 00:32:29.220
The kinds of systems
that we will look at

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:30.990
will be linear systems.

00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.060
They will have a
single unique solution.

00:32:33.060 --> 00:32:35.610
If you can find it by
guessing, you're done.

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:37.620
And we will prove
later in the course

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:40.380
that all systems of this
class, where I haven't really

00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.810
defined what this class is,
but if you made a system out

00:32:42.810 --> 00:32:46.020
of adders, gains,
and integrators,

00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:52.640
and only those parts, then that
system will always be linear.

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.970
And the solutions
can always be written

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:58.370
as complex exponentials.

00:32:58.370 --> 00:32:59.420
We'll prove that later.

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:01.130
I'm not going to
bother with it now.

00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:02.494
For now, you would say, OK.

00:33:02.494 --> 00:33:04.160
First-order linear
differential equation

00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:05.990
with constant
coefficiency, the answer

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:09.140
is obviously an
exponential function.

00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:11.242
So you plug that into the
differential equation.

00:33:11.242 --> 00:33:12.700
You figure out the
constraints that

00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.860
would have to be solved
for this to be true.

00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:19.480
And the answer is that y should
be e to the pt [? of ?] u of t.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:21.820
Should start at 0.

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:24.670
And there should be an
exponential after that.

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:31.790
And the p shows up as the
exponent in the exponential.

00:33:31.790 --> 00:33:34.880
What we'd like to do is
develop an alternative way

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.490
of thinking about that,
using the operator approach.

00:33:41.030 --> 00:33:43.630
So a completely different
way to solve that problem

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:46.330
would be to think about,
write an operator expression

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.480
for this.

00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:51.260
OK, so Y is A times
the signal that

00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:52.970
results when you add x to py.

00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:03.300
Solve for the ratio Y by X, and
you get an operator expression,

00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:05.240
a over 1 minus pA.

00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:11.090
Just like in DT, we
have to figure out

00:34:11.090 --> 00:34:14.070
how we would think about that.

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:15.790
It's an implicit operation.

00:34:15.790 --> 00:34:18.300
It's telling me that
if I knew the answer,

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.330
the answer is the signal that,
when operated on by 1 minus p

00:34:21.330 --> 00:34:24.544
is the integral of the input.

00:34:24.544 --> 00:34:25.710
But I don't know the answer.

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.300
So that reasoning
doesn't quite work.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:33.179
The reasoning that I used to
solve the feedforward question

00:34:33.179 --> 00:34:34.366
doesn't quite work.

00:34:34.366 --> 00:34:36.449
So I have to think of a
different way of doing it,

00:34:36.449 --> 00:34:39.350
just like we did in DT.

00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.489
And the same solution works.

00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:43.110
Not surprisingly.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.909
A behaves like a polynomial.

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:46.409
R behaves like a polynomial.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:49.820
After you turn it
into a polynomial,

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:53.000
you can't tell if you
started with a or r.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.190
It's a polynomial.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.501
So for that reason, exactly the
same stuff that you did in DT

00:34:58.501 --> 00:34:59.000
works.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.680
That's why we can solve
everything in 50 minutes.

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.440
It's all the same.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:12.100
So in DT, we thought about
this as being a series.

00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.220
You could figure out an
ascending series, a power

00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.530
series, that's equivalent
by thinking about something

00:35:17.530 --> 00:35:20.980
like synthetic division,
Taylor series, whatever

00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.040
you're comfortable with.

00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.280
But whatever you're
comfortable with.

00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:29.140
This, A over 1 minus pA,
take the A out front.

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:32.390
Then you're left with
1 over 1 minus pA.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.030
Think about that
is Taylor series.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:36.160
That's 1 plus pA, plus
p squared A squared,

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:38.171
plus p cubed A cubed, etc.

00:35:38.171 --> 00:35:38.670
Done.

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.560
Now I know what the system
functional looks like.

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.550
Now I've got a
feedforward system.

00:35:50.550 --> 00:35:54.210
So I can use the technique
from the other side.

00:35:54.210 --> 00:35:58.470
What happens if you put delta
into a system whose functional

00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:00.888
representation is A?

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:07.010
So you get a u.

00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:08.170
Let me skip that one.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:10.160
That's on the next slide.

00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:16.180
What happens if you put in--

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.042
no, that's right.

00:36:17.042 --> 00:36:17.750
I did that right.

00:36:17.750 --> 00:36:19.610
OK 1 u.

00:36:19.610 --> 00:36:22.120
Sorry, I'm confusing myself.

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.710
This A turned into that u.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.700
What happens if you
put it into pA squared?

00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:34.670
So the first A
turned delta into u.

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:40.900
The second A turns u into tu.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:42.460
And so I get this term.

00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:47.480
So the pA squared
turns into ptu.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:52.890
The p squared A cubed turns
into a half p squared t

00:36:52.890 --> 00:36:56.410
squared u, etc.

00:36:56.410 --> 00:36:58.420
So what I've done
is I've thought

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.710
of a way of constructing this
output signal from the input

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.725
signal without ever
using calculus.

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:10.240
I started with a
solution based on 1803

00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:12.760
that's strictly calculus.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.870
I just redid the whole problem
and didn't use any calculus.

00:37:16.870 --> 00:37:20.830
And the method works
just the same reason

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.071
that the our method worked.

00:37:23.071 --> 00:37:25.570
In the r method,
when we were thinking

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:28.750
about the simple feedback
with an r system,

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:33.370
every loop around the feedback
loop generated one new sample.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.620
Here, every loop
around the CT loop

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:39.040
generates one more
contribution to the output.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.530
You put a delta function
in, it gets integrated once,

00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:45.950
and you get a u function out.

00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:48.550
[INAUDIBLE] [? first ?] in
this symbolic representations.

00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:52.750
The first thing that comes
out is A times the input.

00:37:52.750 --> 00:37:56.390
Second thing that comes out is
A squared p times the input.

00:37:56.390 --> 00:38:00.740
Third thing that comes out,
p squared a cubed, etc.

00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:02.660
Every time you go
through the loop,

00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.790
you pick up one more turn.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.300
Now, think about it
in a time domain.

00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:10.560
You put in a delta function.

00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:12.350
The first thing that
comes out is a step.

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:20.290
The second thing that
comes out, and gets

00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:23.350
added to the first
thing that comes out,

00:38:23.350 --> 00:38:27.010
is integrate, multiply by
p, and integrate again.

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:32.510
So that's this term, p times t.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:37.050
So we get the unit step
from the first term,

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:38.980
which looks like this.

00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.210
We get the linear increase
from the second term.

00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:46.260
We get a squared term,
we get a cubed' term.

00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:52.200
And voila, we get the series
expansion for e to the pt.

00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:53.760
No calculus.

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:55.470
It's purely thinking
about how you

00:38:55.470 --> 00:39:01.440
would think about constructing
this system by a series

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.050
representation for spinning
around the feedback loop.

00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:11.870
So that's an insight that comes
from thinking about the system

00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:17.540
as a functional representation,
as a polynomial.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:19.580
Polynomials can be
expanded in Taylor series.

00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:23.920
Therefore, systems can be
expanded in Taylor series.

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:27.330
If you change the
sign of p, you'll

00:39:27.330 --> 00:39:29.205
notice that that previous
example exploded.

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.824
So we got to an
increasing exponential.

00:39:33.824 --> 00:39:35.990
If you change the sign of
p, it's not too surprising

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:39.670
that what will happen is
that it will converge.

00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:43.040
So here, symbolically,
the first signal

00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.980
is a unit-step just like before.

00:39:45.980 --> 00:39:47.980
But now because
of the minus sign,

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:51.195
there is a negative on this pt,
so you get sloping downward.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.790
In the squared term,
it's still positive.

00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:59.750
So that breaks it up.

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:03.170
But the cubic is
now downward again.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:05.480
And you add an infinite
number of those

00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:10.750
and you get another exponential,
this time a convergent one.

00:40:10.750 --> 00:40:12.520
So the point is that
it works extremely

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.880
like the way the DT stuff
did, except now the basis

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.260
functions are different.

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.110
The basis functions are
derived from this thing, which

00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:24.270
is the unit impulse function.

00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:26.610
And the things that come
out of the integrator

00:40:26.610 --> 00:40:32.160
are steps and ramps and
parabolas and stuff like that.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:39.760
So in r, the basic input signal
was the unit sample signal.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:44.260
And what came out on
each revolution around--

00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:47.490
for each cycle in a feedback
system, what came out

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:49.410
was a successive delay.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:54.162
Here, we get
successive integration.

00:40:54.162 --> 00:40:55.620
Delay was the
fundamental operator.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.450
Integration is the
fundamental operator.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:01.020
Successive delays,
successive integrations.

00:41:01.020 --> 00:41:04.200
And we get the idea that we
have convergence and divergence,

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.490
just like we did in DT.

00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:08.442
Except now, the shapes of
the regions are different.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:15.870
So if the p, which we
will later call the pole,

00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.390
by complete analogy
to what we did in DT,

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:20.250
if the pole is in
the right half plane,

00:41:20.250 --> 00:41:23.520
then the system's
response is divergent.

00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:25.350
If the pole is in
the left half plane,

00:41:25.350 --> 00:41:28.890
the system's responses
is convergent.

00:41:28.890 --> 00:41:31.560
So it looks just like DT.

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.780
We think about this
as signal flow paths.

00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.940
We think about how
feedback gives rise

00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:39.610
to an infinite number of those.

00:41:39.610 --> 00:41:44.580
In DT, each time through, it
gave one unit of delay in CT.

00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:48.900
It gave one unit of integration.

00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:54.730
The method is the same,
the answer is different.

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.480
So what we got is
tremendous similarities.

00:41:57.480 --> 00:41:59.740
Differential equation compared
to difference equation,

00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:02.280
block diagram compared
to block diagram.

00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.250
Integrators instead of delays.

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:09.530
Functional functional,
A instead of r.

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:10.315
Pole, pole.

00:42:13.170 --> 00:42:14.460
Mode, mode.

00:42:14.460 --> 00:42:16.620
Fundamental mode.

00:42:16.620 --> 00:42:19.920
Here, the fundamental mode
was a geometric sequence.

00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.830
Here, it's an exponential
function of time.

00:42:22.830 --> 00:42:25.080
And we've got different kinds
of regional convergence.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.410
Signal converges for poles
in the left half plane.

00:42:29.410 --> 00:42:33.310
Signals converge for poles
inside the unit circle.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:38.770
Same idea, but some differences.

00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:46.100
OK, so [INAUDIBLE]
have time think

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:50.030
about this for 30 seconds.

00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:52.280
We now have two
representations, R polynomials

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.000
and A polynomials.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.240
I'm giving you four
examples to think through,

00:42:58.240 --> 00:43:00.580
and your job is to
figure out which

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:06.610
of those functionals correspond
to convergent responses

00:43:06.610 --> 00:43:10.240
when excited by a unit sample
or a unit impulse signal.

00:44:26.910 --> 00:44:28.280
So, how do I think about this?

00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.140
Is this convergent or divergent?

00:44:31.140 --> 00:44:33.380
What do I think about?

00:44:33.380 --> 00:44:35.770
Step 1.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:36.270
Convergent.

00:44:36.270 --> 00:44:37.870
How did you get that?

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:38.370
Yeah.

00:44:38.370 --> 00:44:39.242
It's this one.

00:44:39.242 --> 00:44:41.552
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:41.552 --> 00:44:43.050
DENNIS FREEMAN: So factor.

00:44:43.050 --> 00:44:45.450
It's polynomial.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:49.670
You get a pole at minus
1/2 and a pole at plus 1/2.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:51.720
They're both inside
[? the unit ?] circle.

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.310
They both converge.

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:56.500
How about this one?

00:44:56.500 --> 00:45:00.000
Same equation, same answer.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.450
Kind of.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:07.030
Same poles, minus
1/2 and plus 1/2.

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:09.180
Convergent or divergent?

00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:12.700
Divergent, because the
regions are different.

00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.570
One of the poles is in
the right half plane.

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.830
Divergent.

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.660
How about this one.

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:22.430
Where were the poles?

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:24.260
Minus 1/2, minus 3/2.

00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:29.590
Outside unit circle?

00:45:29.590 --> 00:45:31.530
One of the poles is
outside the unit circle.

00:45:31.530 --> 00:45:34.660
Diverges, because of that pole.

00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:38.590
Minus 1/2 and minus
3/2, same poles.

00:45:38.590 --> 00:45:41.070
Both in the left half lane.

00:45:41.070 --> 00:45:41.850
Convergence.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:43.470
That's the point.

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:44.920
So they worked very similar.

00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.980
But there are differences.

00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.940
And now in the
last three minutes,

00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:51.990
the last thing I want
to tell you about

00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:54.820
is that even complex numbers
work just the same as in DT.

00:45:57.330 --> 00:46:00.690
So think about a system
that's slightly harder.

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:04.310
Here, I can represent this
by this kind of relationship.

00:46:04.310 --> 00:46:10.100
So F equals Kx, but F is MA.

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.660
So 801.

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:15.330
And so I generate a block
diagram or a differential

00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.090
equation or however I
want to think about it.

00:46:18.090 --> 00:46:19.470
And I can solve for the answer.

00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:21.011
What I'd like to do
is think about it

00:46:21.011 --> 00:46:23.800
in terms of the
functional representation.

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.467
So I just think about,
take this system

00:46:25.467 --> 00:46:26.550
that you're familiar with.

00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:28.350
We did this on
the first lecture.

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.460
Turn it into a
differential equation.

00:46:31.460 --> 00:46:33.280
Turn that into a
functional representation.

00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.821
Now, I want to think about how
you would solve the functional

00:46:35.821 --> 00:46:38.180
representation.

00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:40.840
The idea is just
like before, factor.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:46.655
But now the trick is that
the factors become complex.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:51.580
So one way you can
think about this

00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:55.450
is to force the second order
system into a canonical form.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:47:03.880
The canonical form for DT
was 1 over 1 minus p not R.

00:47:03.880 --> 00:47:08.650
For CT, it's A over
1 minus p not A.

00:47:08.650 --> 00:47:10.990
So I want to make factors
look like that, because I

00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:15.190
know that here, the response
looks like p not to the n.

00:47:15.190 --> 00:47:18.520
Here, the response looks
like e to the p, not t.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:19.990
If I can coerce
it into that form,

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:22.294
I already know the answer.

00:47:22.294 --> 00:47:23.710
So that's what's
illustrated here.

00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:27.640
I coerced this into that form.

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:32.440
And then I'll know what
the answer looks like.

00:47:32.440 --> 00:47:35.930
Just like we could in DT,
substitute R goes to 1 over z.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:40.390
In CT, we can substitute A
to 1 over s, and solve for s.

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:41.410
We get the same answer.

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:45.780
Same as we did in DT,
except now we call it s.

00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:50.040
So the poles to this system
are plus or minus j constant.

00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:53.940
For convenience, I'll call
the constant omega not.

00:47:53.940 --> 00:47:58.730
So then I have a pole
at e to the j omega not.

00:47:58.730 --> 00:48:01.230
And another one-- so I
have a pole at j omega 0

00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:03.820
and a second pole
at minus j omega 0.

00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:07.310
By that argument,
the fundamental modes

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:13.400
are e the j omega not t and
e to the minus j omega not t.

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:19.130
Just like in DT, the complex
poles gave complex modes.

00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:22.400
Here, the complex
pole, j omega not,

00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:25.280
gave a complex mode, cos
omega t plus j sine omega t.

00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:34.210
And just like DT,
the system conspires.

00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:37.210
So that started out being
mass and spring system.

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:40.940
Obviously, it's not going
to have an imaginary output.

00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:44.260
The system conspires so
that the imaginary parts

00:48:44.260 --> 00:48:47.990
of the different fundamental
modes kill each other off.

00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:51.510
And the answer is a real number.

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:54.670
So even though the mode, even
though the pole is complex,

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:59.266
the multipliers are
complex, this sum is real.

00:48:59.266 --> 00:49:01.640
And if you just think about
what that sum is, by thinking

00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.422
about how complex
numbers work, you

00:49:04.422 --> 00:49:06.880
get an expression that looks
like omega not sine, omega not

00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:08.420
t.

00:49:08.420 --> 00:49:10.430
It's a little more
fun to think about how

00:49:10.430 --> 00:49:12.770
that evolves as a series.

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:14.720
If we do a Taylor
series for this,

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.010
we can represent it that way.

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.284
And the series, then,
the first term is t.

00:49:23.950 --> 00:49:28.690
The second term is a t
cubed, which goes down.

00:49:28.690 --> 00:49:35.540
Then there's a fifth and
a seventh and a ninth.

00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.860
And if you keep adding up
the terms, amazingly enough,

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:43.370
the series representation
for the operator expression

00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:47.880
is the Taylor series
expansion of the sine wave.

00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.070
Just like we would
have expected.

00:49:50.070 --> 00:49:54.900
Again, here, the response
looks like e to the p not t.

00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.370
If I can coerce
it into that form,

00:49:56.370 --> 00:49:58.684
I already know the answer.

00:49:58.684 --> 00:50:00.100
So that's what's
illustrated here.

00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:06.170
I coerce this into that
form, and then I'll

00:50:06.170 --> 00:50:08.830
know what the answer looks like.

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:12.330
Just like we could in DT,
substitute R goes to 1 over z.

00:50:12.330 --> 00:50:16.780
In CT, we can substitute A goes
to 1 over s, and solve for s.

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:17.800
We get the same answer.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:22.170
Same as we did in DT,
except now we call it s.

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:26.430
So the poles to this system
are plus or minus j constant.

00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:30.330
For convenience, I'll call
the constant omega not.

00:50:30.330 --> 00:50:32.955
So then I have a pole
at e to the j omega

00:50:32.955 --> 00:50:37.500
not, and another one-- so I
have a pole at j omega not

00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:40.180
and a second poet
minus j omega not.

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:43.700
By that argument,
the fundamental modes

00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:49.790
are e to the j omega not t and
e to the minus j omega not t.

00:50:49.790 --> 00:50:55.580
Just like in DT, the complex
poles gave complex modes.

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:58.770
Here, the complex
pole, j omega not,

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:02.020
gave a complex mode, cos
omega t plus j sine omega t.

00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:10.600
And just like DT,
the system conspires.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:13.600
So that started out being a
[? mass ?] [INAUDIBLE] system.

00:51:13.600 --> 00:51:17.330
Obviously, it's not going
to have an imaginary output.

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:20.650
The system conspires so
that the imaginary parts

00:51:20.650 --> 00:51:24.380
of the different fundamental
modes kill each other off,

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:27.900
and the answer is a real number.

00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.320
So even though the
pole is complex,

00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:35.637
the multipliers are
complex, this sum is real.

00:51:35.637 --> 00:51:37.470
And if you just think
about what that sum is

00:51:37.470 --> 00:51:40.625
by thinking about how
complex numbers work,

00:51:40.625 --> 00:51:43.250
you get an expression that looks
like omega not sine, omega not

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:44.840
t.

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:46.820
It's a little more
fun to think about how

00:51:46.820 --> 00:51:49.160
that evolves as a series.

00:51:49.160 --> 00:51:51.110
If we do a Taylor
series for this,

00:51:51.110 --> 00:51:52.400
we can represent it that way.

00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.672
And the series, then,
the first term is t.

00:52:00.330 --> 00:52:05.060
The second term is a t
cubed, which goes down.

00:52:05.060 --> 00:52:11.930
Then there's a fifth and
a seventh and a ninth.

00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:15.260
And if you keep adding up
the terms, amazingly enough,

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:19.760
the series representation
for the operator expression

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:24.250
is the Taylor series
expansion of the sine wave.

00:52:24.250 --> 00:52:26.130
Just like we would
have expected.

00:52:26.130 --> 00:52:28.420
Again, I solved the
differential equation,

00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.580
a second order differential
equation, this time

00:52:30.580 --> 00:52:32.590
without calculus.

00:52:32.590 --> 00:52:35.290
All I did was polynomial math.

00:52:35.290 --> 00:52:38.410
And so with that, I'll
finish just by saying,

00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:40.990
today, what we did was
introduce, and basically

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:43.720
finish, CT.

00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.780
Because there's such a
strong analogy between what

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:51.810
we did in DT, and how we'll
approach thinking about CT.

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:33.430
Hi.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.550
Our lesson today is
concerned with introducing

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.210
a new type of integral
when we deal with calculus

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.490
of several variables.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.170
And this might at
first glance seem

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.390
to be a rather touchy
subject, the idea

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.000
being that up until
now, we've talked

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.190
about multiple
integration, yet you'll

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.070
notice that the title of
this block of material

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.860
is just called integration.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.360
And the reason for
this is that when

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.460
we deal with several
variables, there

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.887
is more than one
type of integral,

00:01:00.887 --> 00:01:02.970
and what I would like to
do is to motivate today's

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.430
lesson in terms of
a physical example

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.860
and then come back and talk
about, in more detail, what

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.130
happened, and why there is
more than one type of integral

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.030
in the calculus of
several variables.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.620
I called today's lesson
Introduction to Line Integrals,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.250
and to visualize how this
topic may be introduced,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.270
consider the
following situation.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:32.330
I have a force F, say, defined
throughout the xy-plane here.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.830
I have two fixed points,
which I'll call P_0 and P_1,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.230
and I pick a particular
curve which joins P_0 to P_1.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.680
And the question that
I would like to solve

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.840
is what is the
work done if I move

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.900
a particle from P_0 to
P_1, along the curve C,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.270
by means of the force f?

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.650
And the reason that this
is called a line integral

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.470
is that somehow
or other, you see,

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.810
I am going to be
dealing with the line

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.660
or the curve C. Let me assume,
for the sake of argument,

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.640
that I know the equation
of C in parametric form.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.970
Let's assume simply
that C is given

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.590
by x as some function of t
and y as some function of t,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250
and since I'm going
from P_0 to P_1,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.080
t is defined on a
specific closed interval.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.470
Say t goes from t_0 to t_1.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.100
Or, if I want to write the
equation of C in vector

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.530
form, remember, in
vector form, the i

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.840
component is x-- or at least
in Cartesian coordinate vector

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.920
form, the i component is
x, the j component is y.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.980
So I can write
the same equation,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.460
that the curve is R of t, where
R is x of t i plus y of t j.

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:46.580
As long as I'm using
Cartesian coordinates here,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.590
let me assume that my force
is also given specifically

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.660
in terms of Cartesian
coordinates.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.700
It's M*i plus N*j, where M and
N are specific functions of x

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.390
and y.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.450
And just to review,
briefly, the problem,

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.010
I want to find the work done in
moving from P_0 to P_1 along C

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.150
under the influence of F.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.170
Now you see, the
thing is we already

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.275
know how to solve work problems
if the distance takes place

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:17.250
along-- if the
displacement takes

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.570
place along a straight line.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.330
So what we do is the following.

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.010
We take the curve C, and we
subdivide it into increments.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.640
We break the thing up.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.960
What we do is we look
at the k-th increment

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.180
and join the two endpoints
of that increment

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.320
by a straight line, a vector
which we'll call delta R sub k.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.600
We pick a point on the
curve in this interval

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.500
and compute the F. After
all, we know the force

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.230
as a function of x and y,
but we compute that force

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.060
for that fixed point.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.110
We then dot that force with this
displacement, and that is what?

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.860
That's the work that's done
if the particle had moved

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.810
along the straight line
connecting these two

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.070
points under the constant force
f of x of k star comma y sub k

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.330
star.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.060
And then what we do is,
to find the approximation,

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.120
we add up all of
these forces, all

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.537
of these works over
the various increments.

00:04:19.537 --> 00:04:21.870
Notice that you're doing two
things in these increments.

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.650
You're first of all picking
small enough segments

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.970
so that you can assume that the
straight line approximation is

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.890
a good approximation
to the curve.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.210
And secondly, small
enough segments

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.620
so that you're assuming that
the force at a given point

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.790
is a good approximation
to the force

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.730
along the entire increment.

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.260
At any rate, what
we then do is we

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.970
sum these up over
all the increments.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.390
And by the way, notice
that, even though f

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.740
is a function of x and
y, along the curve C,

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.230
x and y are functions of t.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.100
And to emphasize this,
let me rewrite this simply

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.980
by dividing and multiplying
by delta t sub k

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.770
to indicate that if I
now put this remaining

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.270
part of the expression
in braces, what's in here

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.070
is really some
function of t alone.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:17.740
In other words,
notice that this comes

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.800
very close to
being how we define

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.220
the ordinary definite integral
when we want to add things up.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.680
You see, t is a scalar, and
that the braced expression here

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.900
is a function of t alone.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.100
It's a dot product
obtained this way.

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.800
At any rate, what
we're saying now,

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.970
quite simply from the
physical point of view,

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.670
is define the actual work.

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:43.730
Why don't we define the work to
simply be the limit of w sub n

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:47.430
as the maximum delta R sub
k approaches zero, which

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.920
is equivalent to saying what?

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.930
Find this limit
as delta t sub k,

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.410
the maximum delta t
sub k approaches zero.

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.870
And the point is that this was
the ordinary definite integral.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.130
Remember how we wrote this.

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.510
You replace the sum
by the integral sign.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.940
We assume that t goes from
some value t_0 to t_1,

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.570
those become our
limits of integration.

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:16.520
Every place we see
the t sub k star,

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.370
we replace it simply
by t, and every place

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.710
we see the deltas we replace
those by d's and we leave off

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:23.780
the subscripts.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.200
So, and I can't emphasize
this part strongly enough,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.320
in going from here to here,
we are using nothing more

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.800
than what happened in
part one of our course.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.660
Namely, this is the definition
of the definite integral

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:40.820
that we arrive at
this expression here.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:43.710
And to show you other ways
in which this is written,

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:48.160
notice that F is M*i plus N*j.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:54.800
R is x*i plus y*j, so dR/dt
is dx/dt i plus dy/dt j.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.860
And so, if we then mechanically
just took the dot product here,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.390
notice that the integrand would
be M*dx/dt plus N*dy/dt times

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.690
dt.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:08.290
The conventional shortcut for
writing this is to cancel dt

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:12.040
from numerator and denominator,
and this becomes the standard

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:17.920
notation for the line integral
M*dx plus N*dy along the curve

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.299
C, where C joins P_0 to P_1.

00:07:20.299 --> 00:07:21.840
And as I'll mention
in a few minutes,

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.690
it's crucial that we
specify both the curve

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:26.570
and the points being joined.

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.140
And the physicist
usually abbreviates this

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.110
by coming back to the
original notation here,

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:37.000
and when he takes the limit, he
just writes this as F dot dR.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.200
And what I'm saying is that
this, this, and this are simply

00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.060
different ways of writing
this expression here.

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:45.910
OK.

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:49.180
So this is how this
is then evaluated,

00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.790
and what I'm going
to do very shortly

00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:57.442
is specifically solve problems
using concrete values for F

00:07:57.442 --> 00:08:00.010
and P_0 and P_1, but
for the time being,

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.960
I would like to make
a little note here,

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.840
to have you see
what's happening,

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.350
and that's the following.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.426
Notice that double integrals
are concerned with regions.

00:08:08.426 --> 00:08:10.050
In other words, we
use double integrals

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:12.520
to find area, mass, et cetera.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.410
Line integrals are concerned
with curves or boundaries

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:16.960
of regions.

00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.407
In other words, paths
that connect two points.

00:08:19.407 --> 00:08:20.990
See, in other words,
somehow or other,

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.490
the double integral is
associated with area,

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:25.310
the line integral with length.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:28.260
And the point is that in
one-dimensional space,

00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:29.760
the two concepts coincide.

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:32.929
In fact, we don't even talk
about area in one dimension,

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.770
unless by area we meant
one-dimensional area or length.

00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:39.400
In other words, both
arclength and area

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.840
in the typical
definition sense of area,

00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:43.499
the one-dimensional
area, coincide

00:08:43.499 --> 00:08:45.280
in one-dimensional space.

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:47.760
In two-dimensional space,
they are quite different.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.310
In fact, in a nutshell,
to see what's happening,

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:52.930
essentially double
integrals are concerned

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:56.980
with what's going on
inside a region R,

00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:00.930
whereas the line integral
somehow or other is concerned

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:03.450
with what's happening
as you move along

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:06.020
the boundary of the
region R, and we'll

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.480
talk about that in more
detail later in this lecture,

00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.990
and this will also be
the topic of discussion

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:13.390
in our next lecture.

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:16.310
But essentially, for the
remainder of this lesson,

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:19.420
let's take a specific
application of our earlier

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:20.940
physical remarks.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.300
In the following examples,
let's fix the points P_0

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:29.090
and P_1 to be the points (0,
0) and (1, 1), respectively.

00:09:29.090 --> 00:09:35.500
And let the force M*i plus N*j
be specifically y squared i

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.160
plus x squared j.

00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:40.770
In other words, to compute
the force at any point x comma

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:44.380
y in the plane, the i
component of the force

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.530
is just the square
of the y-coordinate,

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.230
the j component
is just the square

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:52.390
of the x-coordinate of
the point at which we're

00:09:52.390 --> 00:09:53.960
computing the force.

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:56.490
Now, what we're going to do
in the next three examples

00:09:56.490 --> 00:10:03.300
is simply compute the work done
along three different curves

00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:08.780
that joined the point P_0
to P_1 and the work done

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:11.920
as a particle moves
from P_0 to P_1

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.900
under the influence of this
specific force, and as I say,

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:19.270
just the curve that joined
P_0 and P_1 will be different.

00:10:19.270 --> 00:10:22.050
In the first example,
the curve C_1

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.750
is simply the straight line
that joins (0, 0) to (1, 1).

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:28.140
In parametric
form, that would be

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:33.090
x equals y equals t where t
goes from 0 to 1-- noticing

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.750
that when t is 0, you
see, x and y are both 0

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:38.720
so we're at the point
(0, 0), and when t is 1,

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:42.197
x and y are both 1, so
we're at the point (1, 1).

00:10:42.197 --> 00:10:44.030
And if we want to write
that in vector form,

00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:48.430
remembering that the i component
is just x and the j component

00:10:48.430 --> 00:10:53.170
y, since x and y are both t, the
curve has the form r equals t*i

00:10:53.170 --> 00:10:55.030
plus t*j.

00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:57.820
The work done, writing
it symbolically

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:02.050
as we would, in the physical
notation, integral along c_1 F

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:04.690
dot dR means what?

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.850
We dot F with dR/dt,
and multiply that by dt

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.520
and integrate that from 0 to 1.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.740
That's what that
infinite sum means.

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.300
Notice, in this
particular case, F,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:18.860
which is y squared
plus x squared,

00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.205
since x and y are
both equal to t,

00:11:21.205 --> 00:11:24.920
F is just t squared
i plus t squared j.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.430
Since R is t*i plus t*j,
dR/dt is just i plus j,

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:34.170
and consequently, the infinite
sum that we want to evaluate is

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:39.405
just the integral
from 0 to 1-- see,

00:11:39.405 --> 00:11:40.780
just taking the
dot product here;

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.180
t squared plus t
squared is 2t squared--

00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:46.350
integral from zero to
one, 2 t squared dt,

00:11:46.350 --> 00:11:48.885
and using the fundamental
theorem of integral calculus

00:11:48.885 --> 00:11:53.740
for a single variable, this is
simply evaluated by this being

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:57.800
t cubed from 0 to 1--
2/3 t cubed from 0 to 1,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.730
this is just 2/3.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.230
In other words, you
see what's hidden here

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.950
is the fact that, when we
write the definite integral--

00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:07.280
see, this was a function
of two variables in here,

00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.590
but along the curve, they have
functions just of the parameter

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.280
t.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.410
This is an ordinary
integrand, which

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:16.120
means we can either think
of it as an infinite sum

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.210
or the antiderivative
evaluated in a specific way.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:22.670
Don't lose track of the
fact that the work is still

00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:25.560
being defined as a limit,
but we can compute it

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:28.660
quite conveniently in terms
of the fundamental theorem

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.830
of integral calculus.

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:31.880
At any rate, the
work done, then,

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:37.020
in example one as we move from
P_0 to P_1, under the force F,

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.640
along this curve
C_1 is just 2/3.

00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:44.480
Now what we're going to do is
redo the same problem, only

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.870
now we are going to choose a
different path which connects

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.740
(0, 0) to (1, 1).

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:53.240
In fact, I will choose the
parabola y equals x squared,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.390
and I'll write it
parametrically this way.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:59.470
I'll let x equal
t, y be t squared.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.540
So that says y equals x squared.

00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:04.480
And to get to point
(0, 0), t must be 1.

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.780
To get to point (1,
1), t must be 1.

00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.360
So again, t varies from
0 to 1 continuously,

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.660
or again in vector form, the
equation of the curve C_2 is

00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:18.250
just what? t*i plus t squared j.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:21.240
At any rate, the work done,
by definition, symbolically,

00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:25.060
is the line integral
along C_2 F dot dR--

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:32.420
that still means f dot dR/dt
dt-- as t goes from 0 to 1.

00:13:32.420 --> 00:13:36.710
In this case, x is t
and y is t squared.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.600
So if we come back to
our definition of F

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.490
and replace x by t
and y by t squared,

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:49.630
we see that our force is t to
the 1/4 i plus t squared j.

00:13:49.630 --> 00:13:55.930
Since R is t*i plus t squared
j, dR/dt is just i plus 2t*j.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:14:00.110
Remember, we differentiate
vectors component by component.

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:04.170
Therefore, the
integrand is simply

00:14:04.170 --> 00:14:06.520
this dot product, which
turns out to be, what?

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:10.590
t to the fourth times 1
plus t squared times 2t,

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:14.600
or t to the fourth
plus 2 t cubed.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.150
We now, again, use the
fundamental theorem,

00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:20.420
evaluate this integral
by the antiderivative.

00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:23.420
In other words, this is 1/5
t to the fifth plus 1/2 t

00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:26.200
to the fourth, evaluated
between 0 and 1,

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.930
and that answer is 7/10.

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:30.640
In fact, this, I
guess, in a way,

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.950
was a bad problem from a
physical point of view.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:37.020
An excellent problem from a
mathematical point of view.

00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:39.840
You see, certainly, from
a physical point of view,

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:43.420
7/10 looks enough like 2/3, so
the change isn't that drastic.

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.850
You can almost call that
an experimental error.

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.240
But since we weren't
doing an experiment here

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.120
and we're working
with exact numbers,

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:52.050
the fact does remain that, what?

00:14:52.050 --> 00:14:56.540
2/3 and 7/10 are different,
and if nothing else, what we've

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:57.740
proven is what?

00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:02.520
That the work done as we
move from two fixed points--

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:06.310
from the fixed point P_0
to the fixed point P_1,

00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:09.370
under the influence
of a given force F,

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:13.600
actually does depend on
the path that we follow.

00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.550
You see, we used
two different paths,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.270
and got two different answers.

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:22.140
In other words, the line
integral M*dx plus N*dy along

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:25.950
the curve C, which joins two
fixed points P_0 and P_1,

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:30.080
depends on C as well
as on P_0 and P_1,

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.331
and that's an important
point to keep track of.

00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:34.080
We're going to mention
this in more detail

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:36.870
as the course goes along.

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:38.590
At any rate though,
let that point

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.380
remain fixed in
abeyance for a while,

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.500
and we'll go on with
our next example.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:46.000
And for the next example,
what I'm going to do

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.660
is pick the same path
as an example two,

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:53.510
only in a different
parametric form.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:56.480
Another way of writing the
parabola y equals x squared

00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.200
is to let x equal t squared
and y be t the fourth.

00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:03.330
You see, in that case, y is
still equal to x squared,

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:08.230
and to connect (0, 0) to (1,
1), t still goes from 0 to 1.

00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.610
So the work done
along the curve C_3

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:15.010
is given by this
particular symbol.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.560
To evaluate this, remember
now, x is t squared.

00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.970
So x squared will
be t to the fourth.

00:16:20.970 --> 00:16:23.790
y is t to the
fourth, so y squared

00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:25.240
would be t to the eighth.

00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:27.460
Remembering that our
force is y squared i

00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.000
plus x squared j, written
in two-tuple notation,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.280
our force is t to the eighth
comma t to the fourth.

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.600
Our dR/dt vector is what?

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.270
It has components
2t and 4, t cubed,

00:16:43.270 --> 00:16:45.970
and we're going to
multiply that by dt

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:48.080
and integrate that from 0 to 1.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.670
That's simply 2 t to the ninth
plus 4 t to the seventh dt,

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:53.990
from 0 to 1.

00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:58.550
That's t to the 10 over 5
plus t to the eighth over 2,

00:16:58.550 --> 00:17:01.100
evaluated between
0 and 1, and that's

00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:06.230
equal to 7/10, which
agrees with this result.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:07.670
By the way, that's not a proof.

00:17:07.670 --> 00:17:10.569
All I've shown is that
two parametric forms

00:17:10.569 --> 00:17:12.319
led to the same amount of work.

00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:14.700
But at any rate, it
does seem to indicate

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:18.710
that when you can compute
the work along the curve C,

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.859
that that work done seems to
be independent of the equation

00:17:22.859 --> 00:17:23.770
for C.

00:17:23.770 --> 00:17:25.560
And hopefully this
should be the case,

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.630
because we would be
in terrible trouble,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:32.000
I guess is the best
word to put this as,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.360
if it turned out that the
work done in moving along

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.210
a specific curve joining two
points under a specific force

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:42.820
depended on the equation
by which you represented

00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:43.790
the curve.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:45.780
But I simply wanted
to give you an example

00:17:45.780 --> 00:17:48.940
to show at least that the
mathematical definition appears

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:50.440
to be consistent.

00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:53.100
In other words,
along the curve C_1,

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:55.790
we got a different
amount of work done then

00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.680
along the curves C_2 or C_3.

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:02.020
But C_2 and C_3
were actually what?

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:05.670
The same curve given by
two different equations.

00:18:05.670 --> 00:18:08.850
So at any rate, the work does
seem to depend on the curve,

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:14.010
but it seems to be independent
of the equation by which

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.660
the curve is represented.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:20.430
I think we're in position now
to start an overall summary,

00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:23.610
going right back to the very
crux of the problem as to why

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:26.580
line integrals and
multiple integrals exist.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.270
Namely, in particular,
in the case

00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:33.910
of one independent variable, the
integral from a to b f of x dx

00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:36.750
has two equivalent
interpretations.

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:39.620
And by equivalent, I mean
numerically equivalent.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.500
You get the same answer.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.000
They are not equivalent
philosophically.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.530
You know, this is
one of the reasons

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:47.950
I have this hangup about
trying to spell out

00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:49.040
the philosophy for you.

00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:51.030
In many cases, you
will say, we're

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:54.570
interested more in the
application than in the theory.

00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.070
As I may have said
to you before,

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.420
in fact on many
different occasions,

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:01.750
the easy part of
mathematics in most cases

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:05.030
is actually applying the
computational recipes.

00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:09.170
The validity of the
recipes is what is usually

00:19:09.170 --> 00:19:11.490
the difficult thing,
and the biggest mistakes

00:19:11.490 --> 00:19:14.890
are not made by a person
using the right formula

00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:17.010
and making an
arithmetic mistake.

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.750
It's that he uses
the wrong formula

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:21.380
and doesn't make an
arithmetic mistake.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:23.140
So I want this to be
very clear to you,

00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.590
why a certain problem
exists in two variables that

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:27.972
didn't exist in one.

00:19:27.972 --> 00:19:28.930
And the point is, what?

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.510
That conceptually, there
were two different ways

00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:34.000
to interpret the meaning
of the symbol integral

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.230
from a to b f of x dx.

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:38.310
Numerically, they came
out to be the same,

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.560
but what were the two
different interpretations?

00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:46.660
One was as the limit of a
particular infinite sum.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.950
That was the definite
integral notation.

00:19:49.950 --> 00:19:53.790
The other was, we could
visualize the interval from a

00:19:53.790 --> 00:20:00.110
to b as being a curve that could
be written parametrically, say,

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:05.380
as x is some function of t
where t goes from t_0 to t_1,

00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:07.920
and we then make the
usual change of variables.

00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:10.140
The same change of variables
that we were talking

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:11.800
about in the previous lecture.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.260
Namely, every place we see
x, we replace it by x of t,

00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.820
and then the correction
factor is dx/dt,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.394
and the new limits
are from t_0 to t_1.

00:20:22.394 --> 00:20:23.560
In other words, we get what?

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.600
That the integral
from a to b f of x dx

00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:32.180
is the integral from t_0 to
t_1 f of x of t dx/dt times dt.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:36.450
Again, observing that this
is a bona fide function of t

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:39.910
alone here, so this is just a
change of variable type thing.

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:41.070
And what am I saying?

00:20:41.070 --> 00:20:42.870
That in the
one-dimensional case,

00:20:42.870 --> 00:20:46.470
the case of one independent
variable, these two concepts,

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:50.460
while different, give rise
to the same numerical answer.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.070
In two-space, however, notice
that our first interpretation

00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:59.950
as an infinite sum translates
into the double or multiple

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:00.450
integral.

00:21:00.450 --> 00:21:02.010
I keep saying double
because we're dealing

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:03.480
with two independent variables.

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:06.070
Obviously by now, I
hope it's clear to you

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.820
that the results
generalize to n variables.

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.240
But the idea is, what?

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.740
That the first interpretation
of the integral in terms

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:17.210
of two independent
variables gives

00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:21.830
rise to the multiple integral.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:24.300
In fact, I think I have
the-- Yeah, that's right.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:30.430
And the second interpretation
gives rise to this expression

00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:31.020
here.

00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:35.570
Noticing again that if you
have a one-dimensional vector,

00:21:35.570 --> 00:21:38.370
the dot product is
the ordinary product.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.310
In other words, f of
x dx is f of x dot

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:45.240
dx, if you want to think of x as
being a one-dimensional vector.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.940
But why is this interpretation?

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.060
Notice the change
of variables again,

00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:54.430
that we think of the curve C as
being given by the equation R

00:21:54.430 --> 00:21:58.510
equals some function of t
as t goes from t_0 to t_1.

00:21:58.510 --> 00:21:59.710
So the substitution is what?

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:02.670
This means the particular
definite integral,

00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:09.200
in terms of t, as t goes
from t_0 to t_1, f of R of t

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.000
dotted with dR/dt,
that again is what?

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.220
That again is some scalar
function of t, you see?

00:22:17.220 --> 00:22:19.577
Times dt.

00:22:19.577 --> 00:22:21.410
That's what that second
interpretation says,

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.060
and that's of
course what we mean

00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:26.580
by this particular notation.

00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.340
Two entirely different things.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:30.460
But at any rate now,
getting back to what we saw

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:36.450
in our examples, the line
integral C f of R dot dR often

00:22:36.450 --> 00:22:40.840
depends on x, but not on the
equation which represents C.

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:43.480
By the way, we're going to
show a very interesting thing

00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:47.390
in the next lecture, as to when
the line integral will depend

00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:49.760
on C and when it won't.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:51.400
But the next
lecture, actually, is

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.730
more general than just
answering that question.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.160
The next lecture centers
around this question.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:22:59.570
Is there any
interesting relationship

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.690
between line integrals
and double integrals?

00:23:03.690 --> 00:23:07.740
You see, in the case of
one independent variable,

00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.970
there was a very
interesting relationship

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.860
between line integrals and
so-called double integrals

00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:16.300
or integrals of infinite sums.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:18.442
Namely, they were
exactly the same thing.

00:23:18.442 --> 00:23:19.650
You couldn't tell them apart.

00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:21.480
That's what we
meant in our summary

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.050
when we said we had two
different interpretations

00:23:24.050 --> 00:23:27.750
of the same
numerical result. Now

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.890
the question is, in two
independent variables,

00:23:29.890 --> 00:23:32.230
these two concepts
are different.

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:35.900
Are they related,
and if so, how?

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.500
And that will be the
body of our next lecture.

00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.130
At any rate then, until
next time, goodbye.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.020
What I'm going to
be talking about

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.330
is some of the
fundamental work that

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.030
has been done
trying to understand

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.240
neural basis for memory
and spatial perception

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:41.720
and cognition that comes
largely from behavioral and

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.680
electrophysiological studies
in the brain system that's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.670
shown here-- the hippocampus.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.206
And as I was mentioning
before we started,

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:52.580
this year's Nobel
Prize was given

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.580
to John O'Keefe, who
discovered the properties

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:58.010
of individual neurons
in the hippocampus

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.840
by applying these
methods for recording

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.690
the discharge of
single cells by putting

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.100
little wires into the brain--
so-called extracellular

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.600
recordings.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.350
You put in a wire.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.180
The tip of the electrode can
record electrical discharge

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.114
of cells.

00:01:14.114 --> 00:01:15.530
You measure the
discharge of cells

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.230
as animals move around in space.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.100
And you try to figure out what
this part of the brain does.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.320
Now where the observation
part of science

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.000
comes in in this
case is interesting,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:33.140
because it relates to another
aspect of neuroscience.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.910
And that is the relationship
between the neurobiology

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.060
and behavior.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.710
And this is an approach known
as a neuroethological approach.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.760
And that's studying
the brain systems

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:51.010
in the context in which they
actually evolve and were used.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.540
And so that could apply
to the use of song

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.100
as a mechanism of
communication in birds.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.920
It can come from
the finding prey

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.190
in the dark, when it comes
sound-localization owls.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.030
In the case of rodents,
O'Keefe appreciated the fact

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.120
that the hippocampus
in rodents really

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.170
has a primary role in
spatial navigation--

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.120
that animals that have
damaged the hippocampus

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.310
have problems with
spatial navigation.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.770
And the hippocampus
had been studied up

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.130
to that point using animals
that were head-fixed.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.580
So you take a little rat.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.370
You fix his head.

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.786
And the reason for
fixing its head

00:02:35.786 --> 00:02:38.480
is for convenience,
largely, so that when

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.850
you place these little
electrodes into the brain,

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.014
the animal doesn't move.

00:02:42.014 --> 00:02:42.680
They don't move.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.638
Electrode moves, you
can't get good recordings.

00:02:44.638 --> 00:02:47.190
So you need to keep
the preparation fixed.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.530
So you fix the animal's head.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.030
Then you figure out
ways to actually

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.380
look, to study the system
given the constraints

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.370
of the methodology.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.800
And that involved, largely,
before John O'Keefe in 1970,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.640
using methods of
classical conditioning.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.170
So you might be familiar
with basic learning theory.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.320
And how do we learn
how to do things?

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.800
Well, it's basically
chaining together

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.290
stimulus response associations.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.950
You see something,
you do something,

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.830
you get rewarded for doing that.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.510
You're more likely to do
that again in the future.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.350
This is a basic
Pavlovian conditioning.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.090
I ring a bell, you get food.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.980
You associate bell
with the food.

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.710
And so that was the thinking--
that all of cognition

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.190
can be built up from basic
stimulus-response associations.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.050
But there was a
movement around the time

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.380
that O'Keefe was
doing this work that

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.900
proposed that that
was insufficient--

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.547
that simple behavioral simple
stimulus response learning was

00:03:44.547 --> 00:03:46.130
insufficient, that
there was some kind

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:52.400
of internal foundation upon
which learning was applied.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.740
And this was the
so-called cognitive theory

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.070
of learning and memory.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.310
And the hippocampus
was posited beta-site

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.930
of one property of
this cognitive learning

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.370
as applied to space.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.740
And the observation was
actually a fairly simple one.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.080
If you take a rat--

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.700
I see you want to
learn something.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.839
That is, if you want to learn
to associate a cue with food

00:04:20.839 --> 00:04:24.920
or you want to train it to go
over and press a lever for food

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.616
or-- you want it
to learn something,

00:04:26.616 --> 00:04:27.990
and you do this
in an environment

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.966
and put it in a box.

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:31.090
Well, if you take a rat
and you put it in that box,

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.674
let's say, the day before,
and just let it wander around.

00:04:33.674 --> 00:04:34.340
It does nothing.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.710
It just explores space.

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:36.620
You take it out.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.230
And now we take two rats-- one
that's been in the box before

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.550
and one that has not
been in the box before--

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.050
and the rat that
has been in the box

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:45.174
before will learn faster
than the animal has not

00:04:45.174 --> 00:04:45.840
been in the box.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.300
And you say, why would just
passive exposure to that box

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.900
enhance it's learning?

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.420
And this phenomena is
known as latent learning.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:55.550
The animal had learned
something that it could then

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.390
apply to this new learning even
though it was not instructive.

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:05.340
It wasn't rewarded for doing
anything, it just explored.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.150
And so this idea that there was
some sort of latent capacity

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:14.000
to enhance learning
was motivated

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.480
the study of the
hippocampus in the context

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.140
of non-head-fixed recording.

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.440
And so it keeps real inside.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.930
In fact, the paper that was
cited for the Nobel Prize

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.939
was the paper in which he first
recorded from these cells--

00:05:29.939 --> 00:05:32.480
and all he did was just take
the animals out of the ear bars.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.188
So he took the animal
out of the ear bars

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:36.750
and just let it run around on
a tabletop, just like this,

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:37.250
actually.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.650
It was a table at the
University College

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.571
London about this size where
the rat just kind of wandered

00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:43.070
around.

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.040
And he made observations-- oh,
here's a cell that fires when

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.820
the animal goes over
to the left hand side--

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:52.250
very descriptive,
but the key insight

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:54.680
was to study the
hippocampus when rats are

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.670
doing what rats normally do--

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:59.510
explore in space.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.340
So it was this
ethological approach.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:08.034
And what he discovered was that
cells in the hippocampus.--

00:06:08.034 --> 00:06:09.200
and this is a cross-section.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.769
The hippocampus is found here.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:12.185
It's in the medial
temporal lobes.

00:06:15.329 --> 00:06:17.620
The name hippocampus comes
from the Greek for seahorse,

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.380
so in humans, it sort of
looks like a seahorse.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.220
The regions here--
the terminology CA,

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.950
these different fields
of the hippocampus,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:29.770
comes from cornu
ammonis, or Amman's horn.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.520
That's because it looks
like a ram's horn.

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:33.940
So if you think about it,
it's like little ram's horns

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:35.690
right here, put them
in the temporal lobes

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:36.500
and you move them
in there, that's

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.583
where your hippocampus is.

00:06:37.583 --> 00:06:39.620
Just like this.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:43.287
And if you make a cross-section,
slice through that,

00:06:43.287 --> 00:06:44.120
this is the circuit.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.530
So information comes in
from across the brain,

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:53.670
converges in the primary
input to the hippocampus--

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:59.000
that's called entorhinal cortex,
which is what the other Nobel

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.540
Prize was awarded to--

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:07.310
the husband and wife team that
had discovered and identified

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.040
the properties of cells
in the entorhinal cortex,

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.130
these so-called grid cells
that seem to carry information

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:18.500
about actual, it seemed
like, Cartesian-like spatial

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.559
information conveyed
in the hippocampus.

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:22.850
So stuff comes in from the
rest of the brain, converges

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.980
in the entorhinal cortex,
and then goes around

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:28.490
this little loop, from these
three primary subfields--

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:34.520
the dentate gyrus, CA cornu
ammonis 3, CA1, subiculum,

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.270
and back on again.

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:37.820
So it goes through this loop.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:39.320
Classically, it had
been referred to

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.420
as the trisynaptic loop.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.620
One synapse, dentate, CA3,
CA1, and then back out.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:50.150
And again, recordings in
this part of the hippocampus

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.700
reveal the properties
which I'll mention,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:57.290
and that is that the cells
respond to locations in space.

00:07:57.290 --> 00:08:00.250
But prior to that--

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.780
this electrophysiological
work in rodents--

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.920
there had been human
neuropsychological work,

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.680
in particular the seminal
case of the patient HM who

00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:12.230
had been studied
here for many decades

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.610
before he just
recently passed away.

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:25.010
Known as HM, or Henry Molaison,
as he is sort of recently

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:32.939
revealed to be a patient who had
undergone bilateral resection

00:08:32.939 --> 00:08:33.980
of medial temporal lobes.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:37.731
Cut out parts of his
hippocampus and other

00:08:37.731 --> 00:08:39.480
associated medial
temporal lobe structures

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.834
to treat intractable epilepsy.

00:08:41.834 --> 00:08:44.250
He subsequently lost the ability
to form any new memories.

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:48.860
So had permanent
anterograde- couldn't

00:08:48.860 --> 00:08:51.530
form any new memories going
forward in the future and lost

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:53.940
some of his older memories.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.470
So you lose memories
in humans, rodents

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.690
can't navigate in space, also
humans have a spatial deficit,

00:09:00.690 --> 00:09:03.440
so there's some connection
between space and memory.

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.480
And the question
is, what is that?

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.300
What would link spatial
navigation and memory?

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.967
But not just any
kind of memory--

00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:12.800
what we refer to as
episodic memory-- memory

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:14.610
for events or experiences.

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.420
And so the working hypothesis
is that these two things

00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.570
are really connected by a
need, a computation imperative,

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.800
to maintain information
about time order.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.390
And that is, if you're
going to use experience

00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.950
to guide future
behavior, you need

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:30.320
to figure out what the
causal relationships are

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.020
between events in the world.

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.560
If I see A and B, what I
really want to figure out--

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:38.060
I don't just want
to record the fact

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.710
that A and B happen together.

00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:41.990
Ultimately, I want
to try to understand

00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:45.170
the relationship between
A and B. Did A cause B,

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.720
or how might I actually
predict B given A?

00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.560
And the way I
would do that would

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.720
be to construct some kind
of simple internal model,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:57.470
a predictive model, that's
based on experience.

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:01.202
And so the idea is, hippocampus
captures experience,

00:10:01.202 --> 00:10:03.160
and then sort through
some process, which we'll

00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.320
refer to as the process
of consolidation,

00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:09.370
translates experience into
some working model that

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.180
can predict events and can
be used to guide behavior

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.410
in decision making.

00:10:14.410 --> 00:10:16.450
And critical to that
is just the idea

00:10:16.450 --> 00:10:21.080
of time and a
particular time order.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:26.740
So as I mentioned, the use
of very simple technology,

00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:31.030
in this case extracellular
neurophysiological recording--

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:35.530
taking a tiny wire-- this wire
is actually four small wires,

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:38.699
each one about 10
microns across.

00:10:38.699 --> 00:10:40.490
You twist them together
in a little bundle.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.430
The bundle is about 35 microns.

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.470
Human hair is on the order of
typically about 50 microns,

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:49.420
so these are wires, or
multi contact electrodes,

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.280
about as large as a human hair.

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.630
We thread these things
through the little oil rig

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.210
drilling device here, which is--

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.950
these little micromanipulators
allow this wire

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:06.220
to be driven down through
very small guide cannula,

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:08.680
and so out the bottom
will be a number

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.290
of these independent
individual electrodes,

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:15.010
each controlled by their
own micromanipulator.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.930
So we can send these
electrodes down--

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:19.720
this entire device,
in this case,

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.310
weighs anywhere
from 12 to 20 grams,

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:27.130
and this can be placed
on an animal's head

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.430
permanently or chronically, and
that is that once it goes on,

00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:31.570
it doesn't come off.

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:36.370
So they will have this
little helmet like thing

00:11:36.370 --> 00:11:40.540
on their head, a small
opening is made in the skull,

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:44.980
the wires are sent through, and
the whole surgical procedure

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.190
takes maybe 30 to 45 minutes.

00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:49.670
It's like an outpatient thing.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.211
It would probably
take longer to have

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:55.060
your wisdom teeth pulled than to
have a brain implant installed.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.340
But then once this is
installed, these electrodes

00:11:57.340 --> 00:12:01.300
can be driven down and
placed permanently.

00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:03.790
It gives you the ability
to monitor pattern activity

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:09.850
across large populations
over long periods of time--

00:12:09.850 --> 00:12:11.710
days, weeks, months.

00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:17.590
So you have tapped into
activity in this brain area,

00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:24.060
and you can monitor as animals
experience, learn, and recall.

00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.860
This is what the
raw data looks like.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:28.450
This is a cartoon of the
electrode with four contacts.

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.010
The idea with the
four contacts is

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:32.880
it gives you the ability
to triangulate location,

00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.760
much as you stereoscopically
can determine depth.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.280
These four contacts
will give you

00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.590
the ability to
triangulate things

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:43.330
in three dimensional space.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:46.240
One of the properties of this
hippocampal circuit, and that

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.010
is-- so this little
cross-section-- you

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.060
imagine a neuron here.

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.560
And so there are
going to be, again,

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.970
neurons distributed
across the hippocampus.

00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.960
In the rat, there are on
the order of maybe 200,000

00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:01.750
cells in area CA1.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.230
In the entire hippocampus,
there are on the order of one

00:13:05.230 --> 00:13:07.370
to two million cells.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:10.720
And if you drop an electrode
any place into the hippocampus,

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.870
you will find cells that have
this kind of spatial property.

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:17.650
And so what that says is
that spatial information

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:21.480
is distributed not
in a topographic way.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:25.210
In other words, it's not
one location in space

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:29.590
is mapped into one location
in the hippocampus.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:33.100
Unlike some of the sensory
areas that have this kind

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:36.490
of topography, for instance,
if you record in the visual

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:39.850
cortex, where there was there
would be some correspondence

00:13:39.850 --> 00:13:43.090
between location
and visual field,

00:13:43.090 --> 00:13:48.210
and the location of cells in
the cortex that respond to that

00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:50.050
so-called retinotopic mapping--

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.880
visual field mapped
onto the anatomy.

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:54.400
Same thing with the
somatosensory system.

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:56.840
As I move and I touch
different parts of the body,

00:13:56.840 --> 00:14:00.520
the cells that respond to
that will be mapped out

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.510
in a largely one-to-one
correspondence

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:10.370
between the adjacency of
stimuli in the input space

00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:12.610
and adjacency of
the representation

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.770
in the neural space that does
not occur in the hippocampus.

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.730
Two cells that are right
next to one another

00:14:18.730 --> 00:14:23.710
are no more likely to respond
to nearby locations in space

00:14:23.710 --> 00:14:26.570
than two cells that are
distant from one another.

00:14:26.570 --> 00:14:29.890
So, as we'll discuss,
the principle

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:33.250
of information representation
in the hippocampus

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.410
appears to be one of kind of
sparse distributed patterning,

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:44.620
that you have lots of
cells that will respond

00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:48.220
to different environments
and individual cells

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.355
don't have a unique
relationship to locations.

00:14:50.355 --> 00:14:52.480
It's really the pattern
across cells that gives you

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.504
a unique signature of code.

00:14:55.504 --> 00:14:56.920
We're taking
advantage of the fact

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:00.490
that you don't necessarily
have to place the electrodes

00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:05.060
at the proper place in
order to get responses

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.680
in some location in space.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.470
Anywhere you put these
electrodes in the hippocampus,

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:12.100
you're going to get
a certain fraction--

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.570
generally about 30% of
the cells will respond

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.770
in the given environment.

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.860
And this is what those
responses look like.

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:23.870
I won't go through the technical
details, but, needless to say,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.050
this just shows
how events, action

00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:29.050
potentials that are detected--

00:15:29.050 --> 00:15:31.700
in here, you see a voltage
trace, you pick out

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:40.070
the amplitude of these little
voltage transients generated

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.570
by action potentials
in the cells,

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:45.552
you plot the amplitude across
these different channels.

00:15:45.552 --> 00:15:47.510
In this way, each point
is an action potential,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:51.230
and what you see is that
the amplitudes will cluster

00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:53.480
in a way that reflect
the relative position

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.480
or location of cells--

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:59.060
the sources relative
to these wires,

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:03.441
using the basic principle that
if you're closer to a wire,

00:16:03.441 --> 00:16:04.940
the signal is going
to get stronger.

00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:11.660
So amplitude is essentially
inversely related to distance.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.380
So here, this is the amplitude
of an action potential plot

00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:17.180
across two channels.

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:19.520
These points are
larger on channel one,

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.900
small on channel 2.

00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:24.739
That means it's close to
channel 1, far from channel 2.

00:16:24.739 --> 00:16:27.030
And then different cells will
have different relations.

00:16:27.030 --> 00:16:29.655
This will be large on channel 2,
small on channel 1, et cetera.

00:16:29.655 --> 00:16:32.720
So you can figure out where
these cells are in space,

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:37.250
means you can pick out lots
of cells from, in this case,

00:16:37.250 --> 00:16:40.850
maybe 12 to 18 electrodes
can give you 50

00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:42.972
to 100 or more cells.

00:16:42.972 --> 00:16:44.930
And then looking at the
activity of those cells

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:45.890
in a simple box--

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:49.310
this is just a little box, one
wall removed, little ceiling

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.390
of cubes, simple
architectural design,

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:56.400
nice, clean and simple--

00:16:56.400 --> 00:17:01.910
what you get is clean and simple
mapping of spatial locations

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.390
into these neural responses.

00:17:03.390 --> 00:17:08.810
So each one of these panels
represents the activity

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:09.740
of individual cells.

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.010
So this is about 80
simultaneously recorded cells.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:18.530
The color of the heat map
indicates the firing rate

00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.369
of these individual cells.

00:17:20.369 --> 00:17:24.510
Red indicates high firing
rate, blue indicates no firing.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.036
So this is a top down
view of that box.

00:17:27.036 --> 00:17:29.660
So this cell, for instance, when
the animal is wandering around

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.290
in the box, the cell is
silent in all the blue areas,

00:17:32.290 --> 00:17:34.290
and when it goes in the
lower right hand corner,

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:35.630
the cell fires vigorously.

00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:38.930
So silent, fires vigorously.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.610
This one fires on
the left hand wall.

00:17:40.610 --> 00:17:42.750
This one also fires on
the lower right hand side.

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.640
So this points out the
combinatorial nature

00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:49.010
of this spatial
representation, and that

00:17:49.010 --> 00:17:51.290
is that if the animal is
in the lower right hand

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:53.810
corner of this
particular box, we'll

00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:55.250
get these two cells to fire.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.580
If I take the animal and I
put it into a different box,

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.994
all of these responses
will be scrambled up.

00:18:00.994 --> 00:18:02.660
There's nothing that
says this cell will

00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.482
fire in the lower right
hand corner of another box.

00:18:05.482 --> 00:18:07.940
And certainly, even if it does
fire in the lower right hand

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:12.420
corner, this other cell isn't
going to fire along with it.

00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:15.680
And at any given location,
there are roughly 1% to 5%

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.010
of the cells that are firing.

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:22.062
So at any given location, there
are about maybe 5,000 cells

00:18:22.062 --> 00:18:23.520
in the hippocampus
that are active.

00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:29.180
So the unique location and
unique context and environments

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.980
can be conveyed across a unique
pattern of about 5,000 cells

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:36.800
out of 100,000 or 200,000 cells.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.300
So there's large
combinatorial space

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:44.270
in which one can represent
unique locations or potentially

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:48.470
even unique experiences
within different locations.

00:18:48.470 --> 00:18:50.510
You see that many
cells are silent.

00:18:50.510 --> 00:18:52.160
On average, about
30% of the cells

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.130
respond in any
given environment.

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.930
The silent cells,
as we'll see, they

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:59.672
can be detected when the
animals are not in a running

00:18:59.672 --> 00:19:01.880
around or experiencing space,
but when they're asleep

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.310
or in these other
offline states,

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:09.500
when the hippocampus is actually
thinking about other stuff.

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.320
We'll talk about that a bit.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.890
And then here, you can also see
a small number of these cells.

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:24.230
In this case, about 5%
to 10% of these cells

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:28.210
seem to have elevated firing
rate across the entire space.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:30.210
These are actually a
different class of neurons.

00:19:30.210 --> 00:19:31.530
These are excitatory neurons.

00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:32.760
These are inhibitory neurons.

00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.430
The inhibition,
the idea that you

00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:37.880
have circuits that can
both excite and inhibit,

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.120
and that this is used
as a circuit property

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:47.480
to sculpt computation
is something

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.620
that we'll also discuss.

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.080
So there's balance between
excitation as kind of a circuit

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.400
principle that's used.

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.080
Inhibitory cells fire
all over the place.

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.170
They're not really
communicating information.

00:19:57.170 --> 00:20:01.740
They're really modulating the
processing of information.

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:04.540
And another property
of these cells

00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.410
that O'Keefe termed
place cells is that when

00:20:07.410 --> 00:20:11.970
animals are constrained to move
along these limited paths--

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:14.972
in this case, this is a linear
track, as we refer to it.

00:20:14.972 --> 00:20:16.430
It's like a little
corridor, and it

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:18.090
was moving down this corridor.

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.280
When they move down a
corridor, cells don't only

00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:22.470
fire where the animal is, but
also in the direction that it's

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.970
going.

00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:25.320
And so this is the
first indication

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.890
these cells are not just--
again, it's not just a GPS.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:30.360
It's not telling
you where you are.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.010
It's at least telling
you where you're

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.650
going, maybe what you're doing.

00:20:34.650 --> 00:20:36.607
So here, if I look
at this yellow cell,

00:20:36.607 --> 00:20:38.940
I can tell that the animal
is not only in this location,

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:44.120
but it's moving down this
linear track in this direction.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.940
So there's going to be a unique
sequence when the animal walks

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:49.020
along this path--

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.940
yellow cell, red
cell, green cell.

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.280
So the different cells
are color coded here.

00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:56.070
So if you look over
time, you'll see

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:59.850
that there will be a
unique sequence of activity

00:20:59.850 --> 00:21:02.780
in the hippocampus that reflects
the animal's actual behavior

00:21:02.780 --> 00:21:04.640
experienced in that space.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:07.755
So here, this is just a
little movie that shows raw--

00:21:07.755 --> 00:21:09.630
this is what you would
actually see if you're

00:21:09.630 --> 00:21:10.710
running the experiment.

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:12.001
This is a little top down view.

00:21:12.001 --> 00:21:16.200
The green circle just highlights
where the rat actually is.

00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:17.910
The color coding--
these are the cells

00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:19.420
that we're picking up over here.

00:21:19.420 --> 00:21:22.160
This is data as it would
be coming out of a set up.

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.480
You see, this light
blue cell fires here,

00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:26.757
the dark blue cell fires here.

00:21:26.757 --> 00:21:28.090
Dark blue cell, light blue cell.

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:30.690
So this is the spatial
firing property, place cells.

00:21:35.645 --> 00:21:36.976
So the animal has stopped.

00:21:36.976 --> 00:21:39.350
The one thing you will notice--
you saw lots of activity,

00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:41.460
and animal stopped there, there
was this big burst of activity.

00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:42.959
He'll stop again a
little bit later.

00:21:48.814 --> 00:21:49.830
Now he's moving.

00:21:56.700 --> 00:21:58.880
Now when he's moving ,
if you listen carefully,

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:01.550
you'll hear that there's
this background rhythm.

00:22:01.550 --> 00:22:04.550
There's a modulation
that's going ch-ch-ch-ch.

00:22:04.550 --> 00:22:07.400
Background modulation
activity which

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.470
is associated with locomotion.

00:22:09.470 --> 00:22:11.510
So there are really two modes--

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.250
you're actively engaged or when
you're taking information in,

00:22:14.250 --> 00:22:15.940
you get this rhythm.

00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.440
When you're inattentive, not
engaged, not taking information

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.106
in, but internally
evaluated, the rhythm

00:22:20.106 --> 00:22:24.620
goes away and is replaced
by these bursts of activity.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:29.480
And so these two modes,
active attentive--

00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.350
you're processing information
coming in, inattentive--

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:37.010
you're evaluating information,
you're thinking about stuff--

00:22:37.010 --> 00:22:40.880
can be reflected in these two
characteristic modes, which

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.420
you can literally hear.

00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.277
You can hear the
difference between the two.

00:22:44.277 --> 00:22:46.860
Obviously, I've been listening
to these things for a long time

00:22:46.860 --> 00:22:48.545
so it's very easy
for me to pick up.

00:22:48.545 --> 00:22:52.720
It might be harder for you but,
you listen to it a little bit

00:22:52.720 --> 00:22:54.710
and it's very easy to
distinguish these two

00:22:54.710 --> 00:22:55.720
different brain routes.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.761
So this is going to be
another view of that data.

00:22:57.761 --> 00:23:00.380
So same data, only now, instead
of showing you the raw data,

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:02.210
where is the firing.

00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:06.080
And that's one thing about this
correlate that's so compelling.

00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:08.660
That was literally raw
data as it was coming out.

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:11.480
There's no processing at all
and you could see the correlate,

00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:14.750
you can see the spatial
correlate, which tells you,

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:16.880
this is not something
that requires

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.730
I have to do
multiple regressions,

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.170
and show you all of the--

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:30.260
give you some sort of
statistical confidence

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:32.180
that this is what the
hippocampus is doing.

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:34.790
You can literally see
it in individual cells.

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:38.345
The spatial correlate is
extremely robust, compelling,

00:23:38.345 --> 00:23:39.780
and consistent.

00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:41.390
Those cells weren't selected.

00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:43.670
If you record any of the
cells in the hippocampus,

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:44.930
they're all doing that.

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:47.630
The estimate is that over
95% of the cells that you

00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:49.350
can record in rodent
hippocampus will

00:23:49.350 --> 00:23:50.600
have these spatial properties.

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:54.410
So it's really a fundamental
property of this memory system.

00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:56.090
So this is the same
data, except now,

00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:57.780
instead of showing
the spiking, we're

00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.250
going to use this simple
Bayesian Estimation

00:24:01.250 --> 00:24:03.350
Algorithm to ask the question.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:08.090
"OK, if we know which
cells are firing,

00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:11.980
can we guess the location that
the animal would likely be?"

00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:16.970
That is, if we know the firing
as a function of location,

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:20.640
we can use a Bayesian inference
to guess the probability

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.176
of location, given firing.

00:24:23.176 --> 00:24:24.800
And that's what we're
going to do here.

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.590
Just asking, if we know
which cells are firing--

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:29.420
for instance, if the
blue cell is firing,

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.820
you would say, "Oh, the
animal's probably over here."

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.150
So recording across, looking
at pattern across many cells,

00:24:35.150 --> 00:24:39.770
and then we're coming up
every 100 milliseconds,

00:24:39.770 --> 00:24:41.990
we're coming up
with a probability

00:24:41.990 --> 00:24:44.600
that that pattern could have
occurred if the animal was

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:45.939
at any location on this track.

00:24:45.939 --> 00:24:48.230
And the probability is going
to be shown by a triangle.

00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:50.040
Big triangle means
high probability.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.580
And what you'll see is,
when we do this estimation,

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.470
when the animal's moving,
you see the triangle.

00:24:59.470 --> 00:25:04.370
The triangles are
only highly probable

00:25:04.370 --> 00:25:07.310
when the animal is
actually moving,

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:09.410
and only at the location
that the animal is.

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.130
So the hippocampus
is centrally--

00:25:11.130 --> 00:25:12.505
the hippocampus
representation is

00:25:12.505 --> 00:25:15.540
tracking the location the animal
and also when the animal stops.

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:20.570
Now, if you listen,
you heard the burst

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:22.760
and you look at the triangle,
when the animal stops,

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:24.275
the triangle no
longer corresponds

00:25:24.275 --> 00:25:25.290
to where the animal is.

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.790
In fact, when you
get the burst, you

00:25:26.790 --> 00:25:28.580
see the triangle jumping
around the track.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.350
So again, there's
these two modes

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:34.010
and the representations
have these two properties.

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:38.240
Moving, oscillation,
track current location.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.832
Stopping, oscillation goes
away, representation now

00:25:42.832 --> 00:25:43.790
jumps across the track.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:50.780
And interestingly, these
little bursts, like that,

00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:52.906
also occur, not just when
the animal stops briefly,

00:25:52.906 --> 00:25:54.363
but when it actually
goes to sleep.

00:25:54.363 --> 00:25:56.224
So here on the inset,
this is the animal now

00:25:56.224 --> 00:25:57.890
has been taken off
the track altogether.

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.931
It's just sitting in a
little box somewhere else,

00:25:59.931 --> 00:26:02.600
it's curled up, and it's asleep.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.240
You get these same bursts
and when you decode activity,

00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.930
you find you can decode
the position on the track

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.840
and, if you look carefully, you
see that the position actually

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.320
follows a sequence of
trajectory along the track.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.010
And we'll go into that in
a little bit more detail.

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:22.520
So you think of there being
these two states, the offline

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.210
and the online.

00:26:23.210 --> 00:26:26.960
And the online, when
the animal's moving,

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.770
the characteristic mode of
activity in the hippocampus

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:34.250
is an oscillatory mode,
described as the theta rhythm,

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.900
which is this 10
hertz oscillation.

00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.600
When the animal
stops and becomes

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.550
quiet and immobile, within
about half a second,

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:44.750
oscillation goes
away and is replaced

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:48.730
by these large transient
aperiodic events,

00:26:48.730 --> 00:26:51.620
these so-called
sharp waves, because

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.530
in the extracellular
electrical field

00:26:54.530 --> 00:26:57.847
that you measure, you see
these large deflections.

00:26:57.847 --> 00:26:58.930
And then, if you zoom in--

00:26:58.930 --> 00:27:02.310
I'll also show you shortly--

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.090
you can actually see that
these very high frequency

00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:08.630
oscillations, about 100 to 200
hertz, riding on top of that,

00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.520
these are referred
to as, ripples.

00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:16.280
And this is the term that
Gyorgy Buzsaki came up with.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.800
He described this sharp
wave ripple activity

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:24.140
as corresponding to this
offline state, quiet wakeful,

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:28.040
and some sleep states.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:32.150
So the first thing is to look
at this oscillatory state.

00:27:32.150 --> 00:27:33.779
So an animal's actually moving.

00:27:33.779 --> 00:27:36.320
And I've already shown you the
spatial correlate, these place

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:36.830
cells.

00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:39.740
But there's another
property of these cells

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:42.020
that O'Keefe also discovered.

00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.777
But this was in early
1990s, around 1991.

00:27:45.777 --> 00:27:47.360
And that is, he
noted, if you actually

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.870
look at the discharge of
single spikes with respect

00:27:50.870 --> 00:27:53.180
to this oscillation,
first of all,

00:27:53.180 --> 00:27:55.060
the spikes are
actually phase locked.

00:27:55.060 --> 00:27:57.230
In other words, here
spikes fire when

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:01.160
the oscillation, this theta
rhythm, is at its peak.

00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.170
So the idea is, this
oscillation really

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:05.930
reflects time
varying excitability,

00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.780
sometimes where
cells likely to fire,

00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:09.910
other times when it's not.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:14.360
And you can think of this
oscillation in excitability

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:19.040
as being an oscillation
in relative excitability,

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:19.820
or inhibitions.

00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.490
So inhibition, elevation
is high, it's low,

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:23.990
its high, it's low.

00:28:23.990 --> 00:28:25.850
When inhibition is
low, cell fires.

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:27.860
When it's high,
cell doesn't fire.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:30.030
So this is modulation
excitability.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:30.780
You see this here.

00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.280
But he noted another
thing, and that

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:34.610
is, if you look at
the precise phase--

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.760
so here, yes, cells tend
to fire at the peak,

00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:41.330
but here, this is now
over time, but animal

00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:44.210
moving at constant
velocity, space, and time,

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:45.840
are interchangeable.

00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.890
So as the animal's moving
through it's place field,

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:53.690
the spikes start to fire earlier
and earlier, as this phase

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:56.250
code, spatial location.

00:28:56.250 --> 00:28:59.520
So you can tell, based
upon the relative phase,

00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.050
whether the animal is just
entering the field, spikes fire

00:29:03.050 --> 00:29:06.650
late, here close to the
peak, versus further

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.735
into the field, where they
fire a little bit earlier.

00:29:09.735 --> 00:29:11.360
There's a relationship
between distance

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.480
into the field and
relative phase.

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.280
What he termed,
phase precession.

00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:17.840
And this is a
representation of that.

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:19.126
This is actual data.

00:29:19.126 --> 00:29:20.750
This is just a cartoon
that illustrates

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:22.070
the basic principle.

00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:24.507
And so the idea that,
if I have a place cell,

00:29:24.507 --> 00:29:26.090
if I look at the
marginal distribution

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:28.680
as a function of location,
this would be the place field.

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.990
Otherwise, it would just
collapse all of this.

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:34.700
This is the spiking now, as a
function of position and phase.

00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:37.190
If I just look at spiking
as a function of position,

00:29:37.190 --> 00:29:40.430
as just the density of
firing, what I would get

00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:42.140
is a place field.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.500
Not many spikes here as the
animal enters the field, lots

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.210
of spikes here as
you get into-- this

00:29:47.210 --> 00:29:50.244
would be the classic
spatial receptive field.

00:29:50.244 --> 00:29:52.410
But now, if I introduce
phase, as well, now you say,

00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.576
"Oh, wait, there's a
systematic relationship as well

00:29:54.576 --> 00:29:57.930
between phase and location."

00:29:57.930 --> 00:30:02.600
In fact, phase is a better
predictor of relative location

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.265
than firing rate.

00:30:04.265 --> 00:30:07.220
If I asked, when
did the spike occur?

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:11.150
If it occurred
here, late in phase,

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.570
then I know the animal is
just entering the field.

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:15.850
If it occurs early
in phase, I know

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.200
it's at the end of its field.

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.490
And that's interesting.

00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:24.320
And this is a simple
model that says, well,

00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:26.510
an easy way of explaining
that is, if you just

00:30:26.510 --> 00:30:27.925
have this excitability model--

00:30:27.925 --> 00:30:29.300
and this was one
of the questions

00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.880
that I guess you asked about
this sweeping inhibition.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.940
So if we just imagine
that you have an input,

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:39.050
excitatory input, shown in blue,
and then an inhibitory input,

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:42.080
shown in red, where the
inhibition is oscillating,

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:47.000
and you apply a very
simple biophysical model

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.540
that says, a spike
action potential is

00:30:49.540 --> 00:30:51.790
going to occur when
excitation and blue exceeds

00:30:51.790 --> 00:30:52.750
inhibition and red.

00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:54.920
More excitation inhibition,
you get a spike.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:01.270
So here, in this oscillation,
anywhere the red trace

00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:03.640
is higher than the
blue trace, no spiking.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:07.180
So in this case, when
excitation is low,

00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:09.370
you have to wait until
inhibition drops all the way

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:11.050
to here to get a spike.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.770
This is late-phase.

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.440
So weak excitation
means you have

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:17.080
to wait until inhibition is low.

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.847
So this is the
sweeping inhibition,

00:31:18.847 --> 00:31:20.180
you have to wait until it's low.

00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:23.560
When excitation is strong, I
don't have to wait so long.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:25.250
It can fire earlier.

00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:27.730
So the principle here is
that there is a relationship

00:31:27.730 --> 00:31:29.260
between magnitude and latency.

00:31:29.260 --> 00:31:30.376
Stronger means earlier.

00:31:30.376 --> 00:31:31.750
That's the
biophysical principle.

00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:32.500
Very simple.

00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:36.430
Stronger earlier, weaker later.

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:39.510
That will give you this
phase precession property.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.800
Phase precession,
you might think

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.110
of as this
biophysical curiosity.

00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.850
But when you think
about how that

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:49.060
would apply when you have more
than one place cell-- in fact,

00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:53.140
I have two place cells here,
one in blue, one here in purple,

00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:56.270
where place cell one is to
the left of place cell two.

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:57.920
So as the animal's
going through here,

00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:00.880
first the blue cell will fire,
and then, the purple cell

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.900
will fire.

00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.700
And if you look
at the excitatory

00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:08.960
drive, shown here as a ramp
in blue, ramp in purple,

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.750
and now you ask,
"When is the blue cell

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.420
going to fire, and the
purple going to fire,

00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.407
during each one of these
oscillatory cycles?"

00:32:16.407 --> 00:32:18.490
The answer will be, well,
because the blue's-- the

00:32:18.490 --> 00:32:21.799
excitatory drives the blue cells
higher than the purple cell,

00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:23.590
blue is always going
to fire before purple.

00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.960
In fact, in each
and every cycle,

00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:28.360
it will be blue purple
blue purple blue purple.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:32.530
So this principle
of phase precession,

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.590
or phase coding,
for single cells,

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:39.490
actually gives you sequential
encoding across a population

00:32:39.490 --> 00:32:41.800
that you will actually
on each and every cycle

00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:43.360
have a sequence.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.520
The code in the hippocampus
is not a location,

00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:49.360
it's actually a
sequence, a trajectory.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.860
This is just raw
data, but I'm going

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:52.240
to quickly go-- this is
just talking about what

00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:53.330
the spiking looks like.

00:32:53.330 --> 00:32:54.788
And you can see,
if you look at it,

00:32:54.788 --> 00:32:57.490
you see these spike sequences.

00:32:57.490 --> 00:33:00.100
But the property's more
clearly demonstrated

00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:01.780
when I do this decoding.

00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:03.650
So what I'm showing you here--

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:04.720
this is, again, raw data.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.386
But now, instead of
showing the spiking,

00:33:06.386 --> 00:33:08.290
I'm showing you that
the result of doing

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.530
this decoding, this Bayesian
decoding, where there's

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.550
a probability estimate
that given spiking activity

00:33:15.550 --> 00:33:18.190
in each one of a
set of successive 20

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.560
millisecond windows--

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:22.900
so I'm walking
along, now I'm firing

00:33:22.900 --> 00:33:25.630
at a finer temporal resolution
every 20 milliseconds.

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:27.580
I'm doing the same
decoding, probability

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:30.562
is indicated in grayscale.

00:33:30.562 --> 00:33:32.020
So you can see here
the dark areas,

00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.147
this is high probability
that this pattern--

00:33:34.147 --> 00:33:35.980
the animal would have
been in this location,

00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:37.780
or to get this
pattern of activity

00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:39.240
in this 20 millisecond bin.

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.560
And so, what you can see
here is that the probability,

00:33:42.560 --> 00:33:45.610
these Bayesian
decoded probabilities,

00:33:45.610 --> 00:33:49.630
form short sequences
every single theta cycle,

00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:51.460
what we refer to
as theta sequences.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:54.130
And the theta sequences
actually move from just

00:33:54.130 --> 00:33:55.267
behind the animal--

00:33:55.267 --> 00:33:57.100
dotted line is where
the animal actually is.

00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.200
The estimate goes from just
behind the animal to just

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.158
in front of the animal.

00:34:00.158 --> 00:34:02.710
So 10 times a second
the hippocampus

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:05.530
is actually expressing
a representation

00:34:05.530 --> 00:34:08.707
of spatial sequence
that goes from behind

00:34:08.707 --> 00:34:09.790
to in front of the animal.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.560
You can think of
behind and in front

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:16.070
as also reflecting recent
past and near future.

00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:24.190
So there is this relative
predictive differentiation

00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:28.610
of response as a function
of oscillatory phase.

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:31.540
So if I want to look at, "Gee,
where did I just come from?"

00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.540
I just have to look
at activity here,

00:34:34.540 --> 00:34:36.909
at this slightly earlier phase.

00:34:36.909 --> 00:34:39.730
If I want to ask the question,
"Gee, where am I likely to go

00:34:39.730 --> 00:34:41.040
to?"

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:43.449
I simply have to shift the
phase, the channel that I

00:34:43.449 --> 00:34:45.520
look at here, and
I can see where

00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.989
the likely future location is.

00:34:46.989 --> 00:34:50.260
So you can think that
there is actually a code,

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:55.929
not just of location, but of
the relative causal relationship

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:58.794
between locations
mapped into phase.

00:34:58.794 --> 00:35:00.460
And we'll see that
we can experimentally

00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:03.400
test this idea,
that that's just not

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:07.420
an artifact of our decoding,
but the animals are actually

00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.680
using information of
these different phases

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.810
to drive spatial navigation
in particular ways

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.680
by using some of the tools
for manipulating activity

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:23.560
in a closed loop optogenetics.

00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:26.050
So we see we can manipulate
activity, specifically

00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.660
manipulate activity, hippocampal
activity, different phases

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.880
and show these different
phases actually

00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:33.380
carry different
functional consequences.

00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.120
So we've got these sequences.

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:36.730
So we've got these
sequences captured

00:35:36.730 --> 00:35:38.560
during these oscillations.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.210
Are these things
actually meaningful?

00:35:40.210 --> 00:35:42.160
Well, some of the
indications that,

00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:44.840
A, the oscillations in the
sequences are meaningful

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:48.050
first come from the observation
that, as I mentioned,

00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:49.582
actually successful,
using memory--

00:35:49.582 --> 00:35:52.040
information that the hippocampus
requires that you actually

00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.530
communicate this to
executive structures

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.662
that can guide behavior,
make decisions.

00:35:56.662 --> 00:35:58.370
That would include
the prefrontal cortex.

00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:01.620
The portion of the
prefrontal cortex,

00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:03.640
which form part of
this limbic circuit,

00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:07.770
referred to as the
limbic prefrontal cortex,

00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:12.240
which have direct connections
from the hippocampus.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.990
These structures are--
in the hippocampus,

00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:16.940
you have deficits in
spatial learning memory.

00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:22.370
Prefrontal cortex-- you
think of this as deficits

00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:24.770
in working memory and
retrieval, executive control,

00:36:24.770 --> 00:36:27.020
decision-making.

00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:32.270
But you can think of these two
things as working together.

00:36:32.270 --> 00:36:36.770
Hippocampus
providing information

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:40.520
that the prefrontal cortex can
use in order to direct behavior

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:41.425
and decision-making.

00:36:41.425 --> 00:36:43.550
And you damage either one
of these things, animals,

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:45.341
rats can't find their
way around the space.

00:36:45.341 --> 00:36:47.490
You damage either one
of these in humans,

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:50.840
you're going to get
memory deficits.

00:36:50.840 --> 00:36:53.870
Dementia is-- when you think
of dementia as being problems

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.410
of cognition and memory, you
can get them temporal lobe

00:36:57.410 --> 00:37:00.320
dementias, frontal lobe
dementias, you can have--

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:07.830
they're really very
closely related.

00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:10.810
And so we can look
at a simple task.

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:13.420
This is a simple task, testing
a so-called working memory.

00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:15.060
Just remember, what
did you do last?

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.630
And this task, it's just
a simple alternation,

00:37:17.630 --> 00:37:18.950
where you turn left--

00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:21.140
first time you turn left,
next time to go right.

00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:22.970
Ethologically, it's
like, "Look, I just

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.290
got food over here, why don't
I check out the other place?

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:29.790
I'll check out places
where I didn't get food."

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:31.880
It's a so-called
win-shift strategy.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:35.150
I got something here this time,
I'm going to go someplace else.

00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:38.510
As opposed to-- a
reference memory strategy

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:40.880
would be referred
to as a win-stay.

00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:42.000
That's really a good spot.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.310
Home.

00:37:43.310 --> 00:37:47.942
I love going home because I've
got my TV, I got my microwave,

00:37:47.942 --> 00:37:49.400
I'm going to stick
with that place.

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:52.564
Win-stay, you keep going back
to the place that rewards you.

00:37:52.564 --> 00:37:54.980
And so you can think of both--
again, both of these things

00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:56.450
have ethological value.

00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:58.460
Home is a good place,
that's a reference place.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:01.430
If you're foraging,
win-shift, don't go back

00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:02.990
to the place I
just looted, right?

00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:10.250
Again, these two structures--

00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:16.330
classically, you think of--
in the prefrontal cortex we

00:38:16.330 --> 00:38:17.990
think of working memory cells.

00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:20.460
And this is the short term,
the idea of short term memory.

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:21.920
So prefrontal
cortex typically has

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.960
been thought of as subservient.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:25.790
Working memory,
where working memory

00:38:25.790 --> 00:38:29.540
is about holding information
over short delays.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:34.006
It's an overlap in
terminology, where

00:38:34.006 --> 00:38:35.630
working memory in
the prefrontal cortex

00:38:35.630 --> 00:38:37.610
is really thinking about time.

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:39.290
Working memory in
hippocampus is really

00:38:39.290 --> 00:38:43.460
thinking about the context
in which it's used,

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:47.600
relative, session specific
information, trial

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.933
specific information.

00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:54.100
So I'm not going to go
through the details.

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.225
You have these two systems.

00:38:57.570 --> 00:39:00.450
One interesting property, if
you look at these two systems

00:39:00.450 --> 00:39:04.140
simultaneously, what you
find is that the same idea

00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:08.515
about oscillatory phase
governing the firing of cells

00:39:08.515 --> 00:39:10.890
in the hippocampus also applies
in the prefrontal cortex.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.900
That is, cells in
the prefrontal cortex

00:39:12.900 --> 00:39:15.450
like to fire at a certain
phase of the hippocampal theta

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:15.950
rhythm.

00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:19.560
They care about,
their listening to,

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.980
this rhythm in the hippocampus.

00:39:22.980 --> 00:39:25.060
And so, we can look at a task.

00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.775
This is basically the
same kind of task,

00:39:26.775 --> 00:39:28.400
only now there's a
back-to-back T-maze.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.191
So there can be two
T-mazes, and we're just

00:39:30.191 --> 00:39:33.680
going to do a simple
variation on that,

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:40.961
on that working memory
task, in which the animal's

00:39:40.961 --> 00:39:42.460
going to start from
one of these two

00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:44.180
arms-- it's going to
walk down this arm

00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:48.700
and then, it has to go to the
arm that's on the same side

00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.760
as it started from.

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:52.540
So it has to remember,
"Where did I start from?

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.150
Oh, that's the side
I have to go to."

00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:55.650
Then it's going to
turn around, it's

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:57.186
going to come back,
run down here,

00:39:57.186 --> 00:39:59.560
and then, we're going to force
it into one of these arms.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:02.800
So two back-to-back T-mazes.

00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:06.560
In this direction, the animal
chooses, in this direction,

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:07.545
we choose.

00:40:07.545 --> 00:40:10.030
In this direction, there's
a working memory demand.

00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:11.900
It has to remember
where it came from.

00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:14.230
In this direction, doesn't
have to remember anything,

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:15.396
doesn't make any difference.

00:40:15.396 --> 00:40:19.060
So behaviorally, it's symmetric,
but cognitively, here there's

00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:21.310
a working memory demand,
here there's not.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:24.610
And then we're going to look at
all these things, oscillations,

00:40:24.610 --> 00:40:31.320
spiking, and the oscillations,
look at the peak time,

00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.450
look at the firing with
respect to that, firing,

00:40:34.450 --> 00:40:39.220
spiking, as a function of this
oscillation in both structures.

00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.520
The bottom line is
what you find is,

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:47.680
that this is a measure
of relative phase locking

00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:55.180
and as how well do
prefrontal cells actually

00:40:55.180 --> 00:41:00.100
lock to this data oscillation.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:02.775
And what you find is that the
degree to which they locked

00:41:02.775 --> 00:41:06.730
the theta rhythm is a function
of whether or not the animal

00:41:06.730 --> 00:41:08.030
has to choose.

00:41:08.030 --> 00:41:10.812
So the red ones are when the
animal's going down the arm

00:41:10.812 --> 00:41:11.770
and it's got to choose.

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.710
The gray one is when it doesn't
have to choose, when we choose.

00:41:15.710 --> 00:41:18.910
Then in addition,
the solid red is

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:23.560
when the animal had to
choose and it got it right.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.690
And the stipple red is
when it had to choose

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.190
and it got it wrong.

00:41:27.190 --> 00:41:30.940
So the degree to which the
prefrontal cortex actually

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.290
locks, successfully locks, to
the hippocampal theta rhythm,

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:37.360
predicts whether the
animal actually makes

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.530
the correct choice or not.

00:41:38.530 --> 00:41:41.620
So it's as though
this is a channel that

00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:45.340
is necessary for effectively
communicating information

00:41:45.340 --> 00:41:48.190
between the two structures.

00:41:48.190 --> 00:41:54.760
And, that not only is it in
the blocking of the spikes,

00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.980
spikes in the prefrontal cortex,
the rhythm in the hippocampus,

00:41:57.980 --> 00:42:00.580
it also comes in the blocking
of the rhythms themselves.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.320
So you can think
of there being--

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.070
this is the theta
rhythm that you

00:42:06.070 --> 00:42:09.260
can detect in the prefrontal
cortex and in the hippocampus.

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:11.470
And what you can see is
there are two conditions.

00:42:11.470 --> 00:42:14.230
One, the animal's actually
choosing, is running down here,

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:15.244
it's making a choice.

00:42:15.244 --> 00:42:17.410
And in about the half second
before the animal makes

00:42:17.410 --> 00:42:20.050
a choice, you see these
two rhythms actually

00:42:20.050 --> 00:42:21.820
lock, they become coherent.

00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:26.530
So transient coherence
is predictive

00:42:26.530 --> 00:42:30.040
of correct choice behavior.

00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.910
The thinking is that
the rhythms themselves

00:42:33.910 --> 00:42:36.970
can be generating coordinated
through the regulation

00:42:36.970 --> 00:42:38.810
of these local
inhibitory circuits.

00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:41.060
In fact, there's been a lot
of interest, for instance,

00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:45.130
in the relationship
of local inhibitory

00:42:45.130 --> 00:42:49.550
control and neuropsychiatric
disease and disorders.

00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:53.170
So, for instance, disrupting
local inhibitory rhythms.

00:42:53.170 --> 00:42:54.700
In particular,
some, for instance,

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.300
the theta rhythms
in prefrontal cortex

00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:00.729
can be associated with
disorders like schizophrenia,

00:43:00.729 --> 00:43:01.270
for instance.

00:43:01.270 --> 00:43:04.840
So the inability to
effectively impose these modes

00:43:04.840 --> 00:43:09.820
and then synchronize these
modes can introduce disruptions

00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:13.900
in the ability to
communicate or use memory.

00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:16.390
Cognitive disruption
coming through disruption

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:21.670
of these oscillations through
disruption of inhibition

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:23.110
in these local circuits.

00:43:23.110 --> 00:43:28.900
Now how you actually coordinate
these two subjective states.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:33.710
We've been looking at the role
of mid-line thalamic nuclei.

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:36.820
So the thalamus as being
a set of structures

00:43:36.820 --> 00:43:39.010
that have widespread
connectivity to all

00:43:39.010 --> 00:43:43.030
these cortical areas, that
much of their connectivity

00:43:43.030 --> 00:43:45.970
is inhibitory, and so they
have the ability to actually

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:51.640
coordinate, modulate and
coordinate, these oscillatory

00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:52.570
modes.

00:43:52.570 --> 00:43:57.230
We've even just recently
published on individual cells

00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:59.410
we found in some of these
mid-line thalamic nuclei

00:43:59.410 --> 00:44:02.050
that, for instance, will branch.

00:44:02.050 --> 00:44:04.390
Single cells will
branch and target cells

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:06.300
in the hippocampus and
the prefrontal cortex.

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.470
So they would be
ideally positioned

00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:11.380
to introduce, to
select and impose,

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.780
this synchronization there.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.590
So that's the way
we think about a lot

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:20.980
of this dynamic connectivity
being established,

00:44:20.980 --> 00:44:24.610
presumably through some
sort of thalamic regulation.

00:44:24.610 --> 00:44:26.470
And then, you think
about the thalamus

00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:30.430
as being regulated by those
so-called thalamic reticular

00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:33.430
nucleus that
regulates the thalamus

00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:35.164
and it sets up these modes.

00:44:35.164 --> 00:44:36.580
And there's also
a lot of interest

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.490
now in the thalamic
reticular nucleus

00:44:39.490 --> 00:44:41.560
in disease and disorders.

00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.250
A lot of the genetic
screening has

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:49.527
identified targets in the
thalamic reticular nucleus.

00:44:49.527 --> 00:44:50.860
So you can think about it again.

00:44:50.860 --> 00:44:58.930
It's like the oscillator in
your computer or your radio that

00:44:58.930 --> 00:45:01.210
breaks down, you can't--

00:45:01.210 --> 00:45:03.667
the information can be there,
but you can't tune into it.

00:45:03.667 --> 00:45:05.000
So it's this fundamental tuning.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.100
You've got to have
the modes and you've

00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:07.990
got to be able to lock
to these frequencies.

00:45:07.990 --> 00:45:10.180
And then, beyond
that, as we'll see,

00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:12.760
it's not just the
frequencies, but it's also

00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:16.334
the precise phase within
those oscillatory modes that

00:45:16.334 --> 00:45:17.500
carry different information.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:21.220
That we actually determine
by taking advantage

00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:24.130
of these techniques,
optogenetic techniques,

00:45:24.130 --> 00:45:25.760
for targeted manipulation.

00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.420
So you infect the
inhibitory neurons

00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.980
in the hippocampus with
this optogenetically

00:45:32.980 --> 00:45:39.880
encoded and controllable
channel so that we can optically

00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:42.760
excite inhibitory cells.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.660
So we infect this excitatory
channel into inhibitory cells,

00:45:47.660 --> 00:45:50.860
and then, we can transiently,
giving very brief pulses

00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:55.840
of laser light, we can activate
drive, inhibitory cells,

00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:57.610
and then, because
the local circuit,

00:45:57.610 --> 00:46:01.160
those inhibitory cells will
inhibit the excitatory cells.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:05.530
And so we have about
20-25 millisecond control.

00:46:05.530 --> 00:46:12.580
And now, we can
lock, or control,

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.370
inhibition based upon the
phase of this oscillation.

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.570
So the idea is, we're
going to selectively

00:46:19.570 --> 00:46:22.780
disrupt, or inactivate,
the hippocampus

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.520
at different phases.

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:27.430
We're going to ask,
"Do those phases,

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:30.820
do they differ in terms
of their contribution

00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:32.960
to behavior and performance?"

00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.590
So here, we're going
to lock inhibition

00:46:35.590 --> 00:46:38.470
to either the peak of the trough
of this state of oscillation.

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:40.490
And so in this task--

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:43.090
and we're going to do this
manipulation, that is,

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:44.175
selectively inhibit--

00:46:44.175 --> 00:46:45.550
you're picking
hippocampal output

00:46:45.550 --> 00:46:47.675
at either the peak of the
trough, the theta rhythm,

00:46:47.675 --> 00:46:49.027
at two behavioral phases.

00:46:49.027 --> 00:46:51.610
So in this task, animal's going
to start on one of these arms,

00:46:51.610 --> 00:46:53.700
going to run up, and
it's going to choose.

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:57.360
So we're going to think
about the starting arms as--

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.110
we'll refer to this
as the encoding phase.

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.190
This is where you have to
keep track of where you are.

00:47:01.190 --> 00:47:02.759
And then, here in
the central arm--

00:47:02.759 --> 00:47:04.550
we'll refer to this as
the retrieval phase.

00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:05.390
This is where you
have to remember,

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:06.680
"Oh, where did I come from?"

00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:10.950
And then use that to decide
where you're going to go to.

00:47:10.950 --> 00:47:12.860
And what we found was
pretty surprising.

00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.940
And that is that, you
might think, well,

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.400
if you shut off hippocampal
output, turn off

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:21.770
the hippocampus, you're
going to get an impairment.

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.810
It's just like in
the examples that I

00:47:23.810 --> 00:47:26.355
gave of suggesting
hippocampal's prefrontal cortex.

00:47:26.355 --> 00:47:27.980
Most of those come
from lesion studies.

00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:29.300
You damage the
hippocampus, the animal

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.390
can't find its way around.

00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:34.010
So if you were to optogentically
lesion, or turn off

00:47:34.010 --> 00:47:35.910
the hippocampus,
you might imagine,

00:47:35.910 --> 00:47:39.570
OK, animals won't be able
to find a way around.

00:47:39.570 --> 00:47:42.350
So you could ask,
"This experiment

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:50.030
is going to identify which
phase, which behavioral phase,

00:47:50.030 --> 00:47:53.300
are most effective in
disrupting performance?"

00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:57.440
But what we actually found
was, when you selectively

00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.442
inhibit activity at
different phases,

00:47:59.442 --> 00:48:01.400
you actually get an
enhancement of performance.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:02.870
They get better.

00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:05.330
And it depended--
there wasn't just

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:07.490
one phase, a good
phase and a bad phase,

00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:09.610
but both at the
peak and the trough

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:12.920
were both effective in
enhancing performance,

00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:16.820
but only when applied at
certain behavioral phases.

00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.370
In fact, there was this
double dissociation.

00:48:19.370 --> 00:48:23.360
And that is, that
trough stimulation,

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:25.040
when applied here--

00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:30.210
so when you stimulate
in the trough,

00:48:30.210 --> 00:48:33.410
in the retrieval segment,
animals got better.

00:48:33.410 --> 00:48:37.160
When you stimulate at the
peak, in the encoding segment,

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:38.990
animals got better.

00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:41.430
So it wasn't that the peak is
good or the trough as good,

00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:43.910
it's the peak.

00:48:43.910 --> 00:48:48.110
The peak is good
during retrieval

00:48:48.110 --> 00:48:50.930
and the trough is
good during encoding.

00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:53.090
So what it says is,
the peak and the trough

00:48:53.090 --> 00:48:55.624
had two different functions.

00:48:55.624 --> 00:48:58.040
And if you actually think about
what I was showing before,

00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.584
these sequences,
these sequences that

00:48:59.584 --> 00:49:02.000
are going from just behind to
just in front of the animal.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.400
What it says is, oh yeah,
these different phases, peak

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:08.790
and trough, you can think
of as like past and future.

00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:13.100
And so if I'm sitting over here
in this encoding segment, what

00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.870
I'm really trying
to do is I'm just

00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:17.570
trying to keep track of
where am I right now.

00:49:17.570 --> 00:49:20.030
Now, I may simultaneously
also be thinking about, oh,

00:49:20.030 --> 00:49:21.860
where am I going to go?

00:49:21.860 --> 00:49:24.472
But for this task, it's
not really helpful.

00:49:24.472 --> 00:49:25.430
It's not really useful.

00:49:25.430 --> 00:49:29.152
At this point, I need to
focus on where I am right now.

00:49:29.152 --> 00:49:30.610
So you can think
of simultaneously,

00:49:30.610 --> 00:49:32.180
the actions of
these two channels,

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.310
where am I, where
am I going to go.

00:49:34.310 --> 00:49:38.690
And I can enhance performance
by shutting off or inhibiting

00:49:38.690 --> 00:49:40.490
the non-relevant one.

00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:44.150
So when I shut off the retrieval
channel here in the encoding,

00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.710
I get better.

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:45.940
It's like focusing attention.

00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:48.290
It's like, pay attention
to what you're doing now.

00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:51.210
Stop thinking about stuff.

00:49:51.210 --> 00:49:54.230
Similarly, when I'm here
in the retrieval segment,

00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:55.020
I'm also encoding.

00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.980
I'm trying to keep track of
where I am as well as, think

00:49:57.980 --> 00:49:59.180
about where I'm going to.

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:02.810
The thing is, keeping
track of where I am here,

00:50:02.810 --> 00:50:05.180
it's not relevant for the task.

00:50:05.180 --> 00:50:07.062
It might be broadly
relevant for the animal,

00:50:07.062 --> 00:50:08.520
but it's not relevant
for the task.

00:50:08.520 --> 00:50:12.400
So when I shut off, I turn
off that encoding channel,

00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:17.420
I'm able to enhance the
retrieval information that

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:17.920
goes out.

00:50:20.799 --> 00:50:22.340
You might interpret
this saying, "Oh,

00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.250
so this is how we can improve
memory by selectively shutting

00:50:25.250 --> 00:50:26.150
off the hippocampus."

00:50:26.150 --> 00:50:30.770
Well, this is not a strategy for
general cognitive enhancement.

00:50:30.770 --> 00:50:33.890
Hippocampus is working much
better when all these phases

00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:35.062
are in operation.

00:50:35.062 --> 00:50:36.770
And that's because
the hippocampus is not

00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:39.260
designed to solve this task.

00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:41.720
Hippocampus is designed
to solve the broader task.

00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:45.690
It's trying to figure out how
is this task relevant to all

00:50:45.690 --> 00:50:47.149
the other things
that I have to do?

00:50:47.149 --> 00:50:49.606
In other words, you're trying
to integrate this information

00:50:49.606 --> 00:50:51.500
into all the other
information you have.

00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.714
And that requires connecting
the encoding or retrieval.

00:50:55.714 --> 00:50:58.130
You really need to have all
of those pieces of information

00:50:58.130 --> 00:50:59.600
available.

00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:02.780
But it does point out
that one can actually

00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:04.790
dissociate the
function of information

00:51:04.790 --> 00:51:06.380
of these two different phases.

00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:08.130
The phase actually matters.

00:51:08.130 --> 00:51:09.950
And it matters at the
level of high level

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:11.670
behavior, decision-making.

00:51:11.670 --> 00:51:17.030
It's not just a idiosyncrasy
or artifact of--

00:51:17.030 --> 00:51:19.730
excitability is a
function of phase.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.259
This is really how
information is being used.

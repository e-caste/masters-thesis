WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.375
PROFESSOR: --called
case studies.

00:00:01.375 --> 00:00:04.860
That is, we really look
at how some of the tools

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.700
that we have learned
during this class--

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.480
some of the energy tools, like
density functional theory,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.990
some of the statistical
tools, like thermodynamic

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.180
integration-- come
together and are actually

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.320
used to predict the properties
of materials and structures

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.090
of real interest.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.580
This is-- I called
it lecture 20,

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.240
but I think I have been slightly
inconsistent with the numbering

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.810
of my lectures.

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.030
We count also the labs.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.360
Anyhow, everything
is on the web.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.780
So what will you learn
today is actually

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.380
how to become an expert
in two of these jobs

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.100
for the 21st century.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.210
One is the virtual alchemist,
and the one that is fancier,

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.880
I think, is the
nanotechnologist.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.360
There was probably an
ad for GE a few months

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.780
ago on TV in which there was
a nanotechnologist marrying

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.590
a supermodel.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.350
It was sort of fairly
intriguing for all of us

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.630
doing the initial calculations.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.800
But more seriously, what we
are really going to focus on

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.340
is how can we break the n-cube
barrier of electronic structure

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.340
calculation.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.890
You have learned that, say,
when we study a system using

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.850
density functional theory,
the computational cost scales

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.700
as the cube of the
number of atoms.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.700
And that basically
scales very rapidly

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.930
the size of the system
that you can do.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.710
I mean, even on a
supercomputer nowadays,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.740
we can't really do more
than 500 atoms, say.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.420
And on a regular cluster, we are
more likely close to 100 atoms.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.200
And the reason of the
cubic scaling in DFT

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.920
is ultimately due to the
orthonormality constraints.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.860
Every single particle
orbital needs

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.090
to be orthogonal to every
other single particle orbital.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.700
So if you double the
size of your system,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.380
you double the
number of electrons.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.870
That is, you have
twice as many orbitals

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.460
that need to be orthogonal with
twice as many other orbitals.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.910
So you have four times
more matrix elements

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.200
that you need to calculate.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.300
But also, those
matrix elements are

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.790
calculated in a unit cell
that is twice as large.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.340
So there is another
factor of two,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.650
and that gives us
a factor of eight.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.200
And of course, there is a lot
of effort in the community

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.000
nowadays to go towards linear
scaling algorithm, algorithm

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.970
that just double in
computational cost

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.280
when you double the
size of your unit cell.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.940
And they are all based on the
sort of physical principle

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.150
that, in many ways,
nature is local.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.500
So your electron needs only to
know what's happening nearby

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.230
and doesn't need to be really
orthogonal to electrons

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.060
that are very, very far away.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.660
And you see an example of sort
of where this linear scaling

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.920
direction are heading.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.100
Other methods scale
even worse than cubic.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.230
We have sort of discussed that
sort of standard Hartree-Fock

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.330
scales as the full power,
and highly correlated

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.630
quantum chemistry methods scale
as the fifth, sixth, seventh

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.280
power.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.370
An interesting
exception, I think,

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.270
among the methods that try
to go beyond DFT in accuracy

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.480
is what people call quantum
Monte Carlo approaches.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.810
They tend to be approaches that
are very accurate but based

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.730
on a stochastic sampling
of the wave function,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.720
so really, a stochastic
solution for the wave

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.670
function in the
Schrodinger equation.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.140
And those in principle
scale as the cube.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.230
And there have been
sort of recent progress

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.310
in making them truly
linear scaling.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.460
So I think they are a
very promising avenue

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.750
for the future.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.200
But in this class, we'll sort
of confine ourselves to DFT.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.400
And in particular, we'll look
at two examples in which we

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.140
use electronic structure DFT
calculation to actually obtain

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.440
the relevant parameters
for a Hamiltonian

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.420
that basically models the
important degrees of freedom

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:01.660
for our system.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.160
So we'll actually look at
semiconductor alloys, where

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.110
you'll see, very
naturally, one can sort of

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.950
solve the problem of
substitutional disorder

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.390
on that alloy using an
Ising-like Hamiltonian, so

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.880
something that you have seen
in the previous classes.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.560
And then we'll look
at another example

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.470
to functionalize
nanotubes, that is

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.660
carbon nanotubes, to
which organic ligands have

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.520
been covalently attached.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.510
And you'll see how we sort
of develop a linear scaling

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.130
tight binding-like procedure.

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.660
We'll explain this.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.580
That allows us
actually to study,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.600
with full DFT precision, systems
that have tens of thousands

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.490
of atoms in the units cell.

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:48.840
So let's start with
the first example, that

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.400
of semiconductor alloys.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.140
Semiconductor alloys have
been of central interest

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.220
since, I would say,
the late 80s, when

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.890
people started to realize that
there wasn't only silicon.

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.550
And in particular, it was
very important to tune

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.010
out the physical properties
of your semiconductor,

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:09.280
and alloying is a very
simple way of doing that.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.330
If you, say, mix together
something like gallium arsenide

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.110
and aluminum arsenide,
depending on the concentration,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:20.590
you have a substitutional
alloy with a bandgap

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.810
that is variable.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.040
So it can be used
very efficiently, say,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:28.150
to tune the emission
frequency of your laser light,

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.750
if this semiconductor
is your active layer.

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.250
And this is something
which, in our department,

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.520
in the material
science course, there

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.230
is a lot of ongoing effort.

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:40.690
In particular,
Professor Fitzgerald

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.880
works a lot on some
of these alloys

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.160
to actually improve
mobility of the carriers.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.670
And I had here some kind
of beautiful picture

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.140
of actually an array
of vertical KVT lasers

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:57.760
in which sort of a number
of vertical pillars

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.940
were grown on a surface
with a composition

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.020
gradient for that active layer.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.930
So what you achieve
on a single breadboard

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.200
is a very high density
of emitting lasers.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.070
And each one emits at a
slightly different wavelength,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:15.970
because the bandgap is tuned
by the compositional gradient

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.950
in that array.

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.480
And another set of reasons that
sort of intrigued and prompted

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.880
the study of the
semiconductor alloys

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.340
was actually what is
called the ordering,

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.650
multilayer ordering,
superlattice

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.210
ordering in those alloys.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.760
That is, when doing
X-ray diffraction

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.220
of a standard semiconductor, you
would get a set of broad pixel.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.220
And what people note is
that under certain growth

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.960
circumstances, they would find
naturally in the diffraction

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:50.860
figures some intermediate peaks.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.240
So in this case, some peaks
are closer to the origin,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.490
or in this case, sort
of the green dots.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.490
So yeah, midway between
the two red dots.

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.710
What it means is that
there is actually

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.560
some kind of ordering
that has periodicity that

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.780
is in that particular
crystallography direction,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:10.420
has a wavelength that
is twice as large

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.760
or a wave vector
that is one half.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.185
And so it sort of hints
at some kind of ordering.

00:07:16.185 --> 00:07:17.560
So there were a
number of reasons

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:19.270
why these were interesting.

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:22.810
And I'll show you sort of one
of the ways one could actually

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:27.490
tackle the problem of
studying these systems.

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:28.950
I had another figure here.

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.510
They just didn't come--
they didn't come out--

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:33.790
in which, again, I was
sort of showing you

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.440
basically the whole
set of semiconductors

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:43.270
and plotting that as a
function of lattice parameter

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:46.090
and bandgap.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:49.030
And basically showing that,
if you look at all, say,

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:54.040
the III-V semiconductor,
they sit in a certain region

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.890
of this diagram.

00:07:56.890 --> 00:07:58.780
But in reality,
there isn't anything

00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:04.210
that is really useful that--
say, as the bandgap of silicon.

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.920
But it meets at the wavelength
for which conventional fiber

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.230
optics cables are transparent.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:15.040
And so a lot of effort in
trying to engineer alloys

00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:19.450
or new materials that go towards
that soft spot in which you

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.820
can grow things that seem
more thick on silicon.

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.340
So you can use all your
silicon technology,

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.400
but they have the
right direct bandgap

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.919
that is appropriate to
optical fibers, 1.5 microns.

00:08:32.919 --> 00:08:36.669
OK, so from the conceptual or
computational point of view,

00:08:36.669 --> 00:08:39.370
our problem is really
trying to figure out

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:45.176
a way to calculate efficiently
the energetics and the phase

00:08:45.176 --> 00:08:48.460
ability of a
semiconductor alloy.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.420
And I sort of shown
you here an example.

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:55.120
Remember, semiconductors have
the diamond or the zinc blende

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.030
structure.

00:08:56.030 --> 00:09:00.520
So they are made by two, say,
interpenetrating lattices.

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.280
And what I'm showing
here is just one

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.000
of the two FCC sub-lattices of
a typical zinc blende structure.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.170
Say, suppose that you are
studying gallium aluminum

00:09:11.170 --> 00:09:12.280
arsenide.

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.650
Arsenic is the group
V semiconductor.

00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:16.990
Gallium and aluminum
are group III.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.630
So you would have
a sub-lattice where

00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:21.910
gallium and aluminum
sit, and this

00:09:21.910 --> 00:09:23.350
is what you are looking at.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:26.210
It's an FCC sub-lattice--
and where there

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.080
can be substitutional disorder.

00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.140
On each side, there is
a certain probability

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.230
of finding either a
gallium or an aluminum that

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:37.550
is basically proportional
to the concentration.

00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:39.580
So if you have a
50/50 alloy, you

00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:42.610
will have 50% probability
of finding gallium

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:43.660
in a certain side.

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.580
And then there is a
second sub-lattice

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.680
that is almost
invisible that would

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.760
be given by the anion
or the arsenic side.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.270
Of course, one could
sort of study this system

00:09:55.270 --> 00:09:58.480
with a sort of brute
force approach.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.050
We could really look
at large supercell,

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:05.740
and perform many
calculations, and find out

00:10:05.740 --> 00:10:11.650
which arrangement of atoms give
us lower energy configuration,

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.110
figure out what, say,
would be the bandgap

00:10:14.110 --> 00:10:16.120
or what would be the
lattice parameter

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.890
of certain
configuration, and try

00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:20.650
to figure out what are the
macroscopic properties.

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.610
But statistics at this stage
will always be limited.

00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:28.070
If you want to study a
supercell that is large enough,

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.760
you probably need,
again, a cell in which

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.060
the correlation between
faraway atoms is lost,

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:37.540
and you might easily need
something like 100 atoms.

00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:39.340
But then in particular,
you need a lot

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:44.800
of statistics that are true to
the 100 ways of arranging atoms

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.210
on that lattice.

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:49.510
And you can only
calculate a few of these.

00:10:49.510 --> 00:10:53.950
And so you become very limited
in analyzing the thermodynamics

00:10:53.950 --> 00:10:55.180
of your problem.

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:58.060
At the end, what you
really care about

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.370
is understanding what is the
energy of a configuration.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.670
That is, what is the energy as
a function of-- you have seen

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:07.480
this before--

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.610
configuration of variable sigma.

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:13.780
We use the nomenclature in
which sigma is equal to 1,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.000
if, say, we have a
gallium atom here.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.710
This example
specifically is actually

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.860
for gallium indium
phosphide, so we'll have,

00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:22.780
again, group III indium.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:24.520
And sigma equal to minus 1.

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.620
That means that there
is indium on one side.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:30.370
This will make actually the
connection with the Ising model

00:11:30.370 --> 00:11:32.500
very, very apparent.

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:36.100
And so what you want to do
is calculate the energetics

00:11:36.100 --> 00:11:38.810
of a lot of configuration
and then extract

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:40.780
the thermodynamic properties.

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.293
And you have seen
already in Professor

00:11:43.293 --> 00:11:44.710
[? Seder's ?]
lectures, and you'll

00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:47.620
see again partially in this
lecture and the next lecture

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.230
how you can use actually
Monte Carlo approaches

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:55.150
to extract basically what
are the average ensemble

00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:55.990
properties.

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.630
But our first goal
for us is actually

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:02.710
finding out an inexpensive
way to calculate

00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.760
the energy of an arbitrary
configuration of atoms,

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.060
without having to do the
explicit first principle

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:10.960
calculation.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.480
And this is where the
fundamental concept

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:15.520
that you'll see in this
lecture comes about.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:20.390
That is, how we actually devise
from the initial calculation,

00:12:20.390 --> 00:12:24.250
how we extract from the initial
calculation, the parameters

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.010
for the model Hamiltonian
that describes

00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:31.330
the energetic of my system for
any arbitrary configuration.

00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:34.390
And as usual, you
need to put ingenuity

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:36.640
in solving a difficult problem.

00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.860
And this is one of
the possible solution.

00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.740
You'll actually see some
of different alternative

00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.910
approaches in one
of the next lecture.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:46.450
But what we are doing
here is, we are actually

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:50.290
sort of exploiting the fact
that, say, if you are looking

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:53.950
at a substitutional alloy,
you have substitutions

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:57.670
on a sub-lattice between atoms
that are really chemically very

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.510
similar.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:01.390
If you are studying, say,
gallium indium phosphide,

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:04.600
gallium and indium are going
to be chemically very similar.

00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:05.920
They are both group III.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.010
They are just sort of in a
slightly different in shape.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.400
And of course, their orbitals
will be sort of slightly

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.440
different, and they
will correspond

00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.110
to a different period
in the periodic table.

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:21.490
But their chemical properties
are still fairly similar.

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:24.850
And so for a moment, we
could actually think--

00:13:24.850 --> 00:13:27.700
and I'll show you how it
works mathematically--

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:32.580
that a real configuration
of a crystal--

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.260
and remember, from the point
of view of density function

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.230
theory, having a
certain arrangement

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.810
of red and blue atoms
means that there

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.630
are very specific
pseudo potentials

00:13:43.630 --> 00:13:45.940
sitting on each
one of the sides.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.370
But one of these
arrangements could actually

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:53.290
be sort of considered as
a perturbation on what we

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:56.050
call a virtual crystal,
a crystal that has

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.450
full translational symmetry.

00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:01.720
So the sort of idea that
I'm trying to give you--

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.670
and we'll see it
mathematically in a way--

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:07.930
is that we could think at the
real configuration of a system

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:11.920
as a perturbation in which
we take a pseudo atom that

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.830
doesn't exist but
is somehow very

00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.890
similar to both
gallium and indium.

00:14:17.890 --> 00:14:21.700
And then we turn that
with a small change

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:25.330
in the pseudo potential in
either gallium or indium.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.610
And if we can do
that, well, then we

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.180
can study this problem with
density functional theory,

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:33.130
because this is
actually a system that

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:35.050
has two atoms per unit cell.

00:14:35.050 --> 00:14:37.900
And then we can try and
use perturbation theory

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:42.130
to figure out what would be
the energy of our configuration

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:43.240
over there.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.890
And this is actually
fairly trivial

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:47.080
to sort of see it in
mathematical form,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:49.900
when you actually
think again at the fact

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:51.970
that in density
functional theory,

00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:54.370
the potential acting
on the electron

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:58.420
is really given by this
array of pseudo potential

00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:01.470
sitting on lattice sides.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.010
And so if we have a real
configuration-- remember,

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.500
the red and blue
crystal on the left--

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.830
well, to that, it
will correspond

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:16.140
an external potential that is
an array of red and blue pseudo

00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:19.980
potential, that can
actually be rewritten

00:15:19.980 --> 00:15:24.750
in terms of the semi-sum and
the semi-difference of pseudo

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:25.990
potential.

00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:28.440
So this would be the
exact expression.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.690
We have the true
pseudo potential

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:35.220
on each sort of FCC
sub-lattice site.

00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:39.750
But we write, say,
gallium pseudo potential

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:47.060
as being given by the sum of
the average between the gallium

00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.140
and the indium pseudo
potential, say, plus one

00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:52.790
half the semi-difference.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:55.280
You see, if I'm
sitting on a site,

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:58.790
and I'm telling you that
the pseudo potential acting

00:15:58.790 --> 00:16:02.810
on that side is going to be
the sum between the average

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:08.210
between gallium and indium plus
one half the semi-difference,

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:12.140
you see that the indium cancels
out, and the gallium sums up.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:15.080
And what you have is the
gallium pseudo potential there.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.630
And so a sigma variable
equal to plus 1 at the site R

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:25.130
really gives you a gallium
pseudo potential in that site.

00:16:25.130 --> 00:16:27.830
And a sigma variable
equal to minus 1

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:31.230
gives you an indium pseudo
potential in that site.

00:16:31.230 --> 00:16:35.660
But in this form, and in the
limit in which the two pseudo

00:16:35.660 --> 00:16:38.240
potential are
fairly similar, you

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.450
can see that this term
is actually small.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:43.460
The more similar
gallium and indium

00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.580
are, the smaller this system is.

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:50.270
But this term here
overall is the only one

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:53.520
where the configurational
variables are present.

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.760
There are no configurational
variable here.

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:59.750
And so this represents, really,
the green average virtual

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:02.810
crystal to which
at every site, we

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.140
add or subtract depending
on the sign of sigma

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.560
R, the semi-difference of
the two pseudo potential.

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:13.790
And this term really
turns a green atom

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.859
in a red or blue atom.

00:17:15.859 --> 00:17:19.160
And for the specific case
of semiconductor alloys,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:22.160
this term is smaller,
because disorder

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:26.490
takes place between atoms
that are very small.

00:17:26.490 --> 00:17:29.540
And so what we are going to do
is use density function theory

00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:33.350
to study this crystal then
use perturbation theory

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:37.490
to understand what is going on
when we do this perturbation.

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:40.100
And so this is also
sort of a chance

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:44.570
for me to at least
hint at how we actually

00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:49.220
perform perturbation theory
in density functional theory

00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.250
itself.

00:17:50.250 --> 00:17:51.920
And that's a very useful tool.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:54.170
Say, it's used,
and you'll see it,

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.260
and you have seen it
before, to calculate things

00:17:57.260 --> 00:17:58.790
like phonon dispersions.

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.180
That is, what is
the force or what

00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:06.680
is the frequency of perturbation
in the atomic position

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.570
with a certain
wavelength that is really

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:10.310
the normal mode of the crystal.

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:13.860
Or it can be used in
a variety of problems,

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.730
say, to study what is
the response of a system

00:18:16.730 --> 00:18:18.980
to an electric field
and then calculate

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.750
Raman or infrared spectra.

00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.270
It can be used to calculate
the response of a system

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.930
to a magnetic field and then
calculate the NMR spectra,

00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:30.740
or it can even be used
to calculate higher order

00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.360
important physical quantities.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.750
If we go to sort of
higher order response,

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.540
we can start to calculate
what is the third order

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:40.910
Hamiltonian in the
phonons, so what are the--

00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:43.910
in the phonons, what are
the lifetime of phonons.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:49.430
Or we can calculate how an
electronic state couples

00:18:49.430 --> 00:18:51.560
with a phonon state.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.990
And so we can actually
get out the parameters,

00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:55.790
say, for superconductivity.

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:59.600
That is, when electrons travel
through a crystal paired

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.020
because of the interaction with
the phonon degrees of freedom.

00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:06.890
Or we could calculate, say,
resonant Raman scattering

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.500
that, again, is sort of a strong
electron-phonon component.

00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.100
But in general, the
problem is just this.

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.980
Perturbation theory
looks at what

00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:20.840
happens to a certain system that
has an external potential v0

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.420
when you add a perturbation.

00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:26.630
And the perturbation is
sort of parameterized

00:19:26.630 --> 00:19:28.670
by a certain strength lambda.

00:19:28.670 --> 00:19:32.400
So for small lambda, the
perturbation is weak.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:35.690
So we are sort of thinking
at the limit of what happens

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.830
when the perturbation is weak.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:43.310
So you add a lambda delta v
term to your external potential.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.730
And in this specific
case, that delta v term

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:48.440
is going to be that
semi-difference

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.220
between the pseudo potential.

00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:53.090
So it's the term that really
transform a virtual atom

00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:55.790
in a real gallium
and in a real indium.

00:19:55.790 --> 00:20:00.380
What happens when you apply
this small perturbation is that,

00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.330
of course, your new
self-consistent charge density

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.690
will change.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:10.220
So if, for a given
external potential v0,

00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:17.280
you add a ground state charge
density n0 for a perturbation

00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.910
in which you add the
term lambda delta v,

00:20:19.910 --> 00:20:22.370
your new ground
state charge density

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:25.430
is going to be a certain
charge density that

00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:28.160
will define us n lambda.

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:31.070
But we can think
of this n lambda

00:20:31.070 --> 00:20:38.310
as being sort of expanded in a
power series of power lambdas.

00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:42.020
So the new n lambda is going to
be given by the original ground

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:44.580
state charge density
plus a term that we

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:49.350
call the linear response that
is a first order in lambda,

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:52.030
plus a term that is a
second-order response,

00:20:52.030 --> 00:20:54.870
plus a term that is third
order and fourth order

00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:56.470
and so on and so forth.

00:20:56.470 --> 00:21:00.690
And the smaller the lambda
is, the less relevant

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:02.880
will be the higher order terms.

00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.650
And what is really important is
just this first order response

00:21:07.650 --> 00:21:09.640
in the charge density.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:13.650
And this actually sort of
gives us a lot of power.

00:21:13.650 --> 00:21:18.090
That is, just knowing the first
order response in the charge

00:21:18.090 --> 00:21:23.190
density allows us to calculate
the energy of a system

00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.230
in the presence of
this perturbation

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:27.390
up to the second order.

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:30.870
And this basically
can be seen by using

00:21:30.870 --> 00:21:34.230
Hellmann-Feynman theorem here.

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.160
This is-- you have seen it sort
of when we discussed forces,

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:41.820
and it's really a sort of direct
consequence of the ground state

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.120
properties of the orbitals
in the Schrodinger equation.

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:47.550
But basically, what does
Hellmann-Feynman theorem

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:48.330
tells us?

00:21:48.330 --> 00:21:49.920
Well, it tells us
that if we need

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.370
to look at the change
in energy with respect

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:56.070
to a certain perturbation,
the only thing

00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.320
that we need to
calculate is actually

00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:05.720
the expectation value of
the orbitals with respect

00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:07.000
to the perturbation.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.220
So this is really
Hellmann-Feynman theorem.

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.240
You might remember this.

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.260
We have discussed it.

00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:15.350
We don't need to take into
account the derivative

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:16.460
of, say, lambda--

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.630
sorry, I'm using too
many lambdas here.

00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:23.900
But let's call it
lambda again here.

00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:27.620
We don't need to take into
account the changes in the wave

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.970
functions themselves.

00:22:28.970 --> 00:22:32.010
We just calculate the
expectation value.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.700
So for any given
arbitrary lambda,

00:22:34.700 --> 00:22:36.915
the derivative of the
energy, the change

00:22:36.915 --> 00:22:38.600
in the energy with
respect to lambda,

00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.540
is just given by
this simple integral.

00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:47.180
And so you see that if we
then say that we actually

00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:53.180
expand the energy up to the
first-order term, what we have

00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:58.835
is that the energy is
equal to e0 plus lambda d

00:22:58.835 --> 00:23:00.950
e over d lambda.

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:04.460
And then there would be a
one half lambda square term.

00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:07.045
But then in itself,
we can expand--

00:23:07.045 --> 00:23:08.750
it's a little bit
father, so I'm sort

00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:12.470
of skipping some of the
passages-- we can expand this n

00:23:12.470 --> 00:23:15.320
lambda in powers of lambda.

00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:19.250
And so what you see is
that up to the second order

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.280
in lambda, the
only terms that are

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.740
relevant in the expansion
of your energy--

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:27.140
and this is what is important--

00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:31.130
are, for the first order
term, just the integral

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:34.550
of the perturbation with respect
to the ground state's charge

00:23:34.550 --> 00:23:37.430
density, and for the
second-order term,

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.580
the integral of the perturbation
with the first order

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.830
change in the charge density.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:47.190
So perturbation
induces a change.

00:23:47.190 --> 00:23:51.440
And if we are able to calculate
the linear response to that,

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.260
this n1, we actually
get correction

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:57.860
to the energy up to
the second-order term.

00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:00.900
And so there is a whole branch
of density functional theory

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.190
that's called density functional
perturbation theory that

00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:10.700
really deals on how to calculate
this linear order perturbation.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:14.240
And I really won't
go into the detail.

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:16.460
The sort of other
difficulty with respect

00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:19.790
to a standard set of quantum
mechanical perturbation theory

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.590
is that in density
functional theory,

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:24.980
the Hamiltonian is in
itself self-consistent.

00:24:24.980 --> 00:24:27.320
And so you have an added
layer of complexity,

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.780
because it depends from
the charge density itself.

00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:33.020
And so when you have
got a perturbation

00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:35.750
in your external
potential, the perturbation

00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:39.740
in your Kohn-Sham potential
contains also term

00:24:39.740 --> 00:24:43.130
in the Hartree and in the
exchange correlation term.

00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:45.380
So we won't really go
into these details,

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:48.380
but there is, again, an
iterative self-consistent

00:24:48.380 --> 00:24:52.520
procedure to obtain the
self-consistent linear order

00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.920
response to an
external perturbation.

00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:59.100
And all of this is actually
implemented in the PWSCF code.

00:24:59.100 --> 00:25:01.250
So some of you might
at certain point

00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:04.010
need to use that, again,
to calculate quantities

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:05.930
like the phonon dispersions.

00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.450
And there are actually
examples in the distribution

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:10.920
that tell you how to do that.

00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.350
And so if we go back to our
original problem, all of this

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.810
was actually to
convince you that if we

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.750
are able to calculate
this linear response,

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:24.260
the first order change in
the charge density induced

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.720
by a certain
perturbation, we actually

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.400
have the energy of a system
up to the second order

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.520
in the perturbation, where
the first order term, again,

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.490
is just given by the integral
of the ground state charge

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:39.560
density in the perturbation.

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:41.390
And the second
order term is given

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:45.020
by the integral of
the linear response

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:46.850
times the perturbation.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:50.240
But you see, what is
now the fundamental step

00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.570
is that these
quantities don't depend

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:56.330
on the configurational
variables.

00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:59.780
These are quantities that
are calculated on the ground

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.180
state-- that is,
the green crystal--

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:05.150
something that doesn't
depend on configuration.

00:26:05.150 --> 00:26:09.890
So this can be calculated
once and for all just

00:26:09.890 --> 00:26:13.920
on the system that contains
two atoms per unit cell.

00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.790
And once you have
calculated this,

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:20.210
this will give you the
energy up to the second order

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:22.470
in the configurational
variables.

00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:25.100
So doing this calculation
will take some time,

00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.620
but it's really on a
two-atom unit cell.

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:30.350
But once you have
this, what you have

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:35.420
is really a analytical
and extremely inexpensive

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:39.200
expression to calculate the
energy up to the second order.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:43.730
So as long as your
disorder is weak,

00:26:43.730 --> 00:26:46.760
you will get a very good
approximation of the energy

00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:50.180
just by doing this set of
sums that a computer will

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:55.140
take probably a nanosecond
or something like this.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.720
And again, this really
looks like an Ising model

00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:00.980
Hamiltonian.

00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.600
If you remember what you
had in the Ising model--

00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:09.240
is that you had a sort of
coupling between nearby spins

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.290
that was parameterized by a
certain exchange parameter

00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.410
here.

00:27:14.410 --> 00:27:16.790
The only difference
is that, being these

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:20.640
are semiconductor
alloys, interactions

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.450
tend to be long range.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:28.350
And so it's not only atoms or
sigma variables sitting nearby

00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:31.830
that sort of interact, but
the interaction sort of

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.930
goes on farther and farther.

00:27:34.930 --> 00:27:39.060
And so it's a sort of long
range Ising Hamiltonian.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:43.440
But once you have this, you
can do all the thermodynamics

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:47.420
that you want to your problem
and very inexpensively.

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.360
I'll sort of go very
quickly through this.

00:27:55.360 --> 00:28:00.850
But again, what we have seen
up to now is really this sort

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.750
of fundamental concept that
the electronic structure

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:08.620
calculation or our energy
calculation allows us

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.060
to extract parameters--
in this case,

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.960
the J interaction constants--

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.720
that gives us the
energy of our system.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.450
And as usual, when
you really need

00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:22.700
to find out what are the
parameters to extract,

00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.540
you need to think at what
are your relevant degrees

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:26.190
of freedom.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:29.210
So you need to think at the
physics of your problem.

00:28:29.210 --> 00:28:31.900
And if you have a
semiconductor alloy,

00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:34.840
the first degree of freedom
that comes to mind correctly

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.940
is the configurational
degree of freedom.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:41.530
That is, we can have on a
certain site one atom, gallium,

00:28:41.530 --> 00:28:43.510
or another atom, indium.

00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:47.830
But actually, it's not the
only degrees of freedom that is

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:53.410
relevant, because depending on
which atom you put on a certain

00:28:53.410 --> 00:28:57.550
side, what you have is that,
depending on also what is

00:28:57.550 --> 00:29:01.540
the surrounding environment-- if
it's a gallium between gallium

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:04.720
atoms or if it's a gallium
between indium atoms--

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.690
that atom will see
a broken symmetry.

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:12.370
And so it will want to
relax from the ideal sort

00:29:12.370 --> 00:29:14.710
of periodic Bravais
lattice position

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.860
and will likely
like to move around,

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.770
either to make space
for larger atoms that

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:24.460
are nearby or sort of to make
space for itself if there

00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.210
are smaller atoms.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:30.340
And so this is sort of where
intuition becomes important.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:34.690
And so you need to decide
what are the important degrees

00:29:34.690 --> 00:29:35.510
of freedom.

00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:37.120
And in this case,
what we are saying

00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.990
is that there are not only
configurational variables that

00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:42.760
are important
degrees of freedom,

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:47.710
but there are also displacements
of the atoms in response

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.070
to a certain configuration
away from equilibrium.

00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.080
And so once you have
identified that there

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.880
is this second set of
degrees of freedom,

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.420
well, what you are really
saying is that we really

00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:02.800
need to consider, in the
expansion of the energy

00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.020
over all my degrees
of freedom, not

00:30:05.020 --> 00:30:07.990
only the configurational
variables but also

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.020
the displacement
of an atom, say,

00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:13.130
from its equilibrium position.

00:30:13.130 --> 00:30:16.450
And so we need to
expand their energy up

00:30:16.450 --> 00:30:20.770
to the second order, not only
in configuration but also

00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:22.600
in displacements.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:25.540
And because we are expanding
up to the second order

00:30:25.540 --> 00:30:27.910
in configuration and
in displacements,

00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:31.000
there is going to be
also a mixed term that

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.210
is half configuration
and half displacement.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.900
If you want this
term, think of F

00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:41.260
as being the second derivative
of the energy with respect

00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:43.810
to u and with respect
towards sigma.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:46.780
So this term here
is telling us what

00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.910
is the force that is
induced on the atom R

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:57.190
when, on the side R prime,
there is a certain atom given

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:01.060
by the configurational
variable sigma.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.200
So we really need to expand
in all our degrees of freedom.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.300
But then we can
do something more.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:12.190
And we can even sort of apply
an equilibrium condition.

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:15.580
Because at the end, what we
want to do for the system is not

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.000
really the dynamics, but
what we really want to do

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.060
is the thermodynamics of the
different configurations.

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.090
So what we are
saying is that, well,

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:29.300
suppose that we have chosen a
certain configuration of atoms.

00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:31.840
Now, what we really need
to take into account

00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.110
is not only how the
energy changes but also

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:39.250
how the atom moves around to
accommodate the configuration

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:40.840
as best as possible.

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:46.150
But that really means that
the atoms will move in order

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:49.270
to minimize the
energy, or if you want,

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:52.960
in order to have really zero
force at a certain point.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:55.150
If you start from
the periodic lattice

00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:58.810
and you sort of decide a certain
configuration, on those sites,

00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:59.950
there will be forces.

00:31:59.950 --> 00:32:02.870
Atoms move a little bit
away from that site,

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:04.570
so that their force is 0.

00:32:04.570 --> 00:32:07.810
So what we have is here the
sort of physical embodiment

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.310
of the degrees of freedom.

00:32:09.310 --> 00:32:12.010
The energy is expanded
up to the second order.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:14.860
But then we also apply
an equilibrium condition.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:18.940
That is, the force on the ions
for a given configuration sigma

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.050
must be 0.

00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:22.390
So the derivative, the
first order derivative

00:32:22.390 --> 00:32:25.690
of the energy with displacement,
that is the force, must be 0.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:29.560
And if you apply that at this
and you work the algebra,

00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.580
you really obtain,
for a given set

00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:37.780
of configurational variable,
what are the displacements away

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.850
from equilibrium
that are induced

00:32:39.850 --> 00:32:42.020
by this configurational
variable.

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:46.600
And of course, they are mediated
by this response function

00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.830
of our system, the
force on an atom induced

00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:54.400
by our configurational
variable, and really,

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.010
the second-order
derivative, the stiffness

00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.710
of our potential energy
surface with respect

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.420
to atomic displacements.

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.090
And so we use this
equilibrium condition.

00:33:04.090 --> 00:33:06.190
That is, for a
given configuration,

00:33:06.190 --> 00:33:08.290
the displacement
are really given.

00:33:08.290 --> 00:33:11.680
And we take it, and we
stick it back inside.

00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:17.920
So we substitute, for the green
u of R, this expression here.

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:20.440
Those are all sort of
tensorial quantities

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:23.440
which I sort of
removed the sums.

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:30.280
But so we are back to our
spin Ising Hamiltonian

00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.770
in which the only
thing that is relevant

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:34.570
is the configurational
variables,

00:33:34.570 --> 00:33:37.210
because at the end, that's the
only thing that can happen.

00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:39.890
We can have a certain
atom in a certain place,

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:45.070
but we take into account the
fact that the ions sort of

00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.080
go back, move to equilibrium.

00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:51.130
And we take that into
account by a renormalization

00:33:51.130 --> 00:33:55.090
of the interaction
constant j by, if you want,

00:33:55.090 --> 00:34:01.690
the displacement term or what
we would call the elastic terms.

00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:09.489
OK, so we have all the tools to
calculate this regional j, this

00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:12.310
that would be nothing else
than the dynamical force

00:34:12.310 --> 00:34:14.500
constant matrix
that you diagonalize

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:17.350
in your final calculation
or this mixed term that

00:34:17.350 --> 00:34:19.840
in the literature are
called Kanzaki forces.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:21.800
We do this on the
virtual crystal.

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:25.510
And then we really have
our spin Hamiltonian,

00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:32.139
including the energetics
effects of atomic displacements.

00:34:32.139 --> 00:34:36.880
And so we have really the
Hamiltonian of our system,

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.300
and we can start doing
the thermodynamics of it,

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:45.130
with a small caveat that
what we have done up to now

00:34:45.130 --> 00:34:46.449
is really this step.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:48.070
We have been able
to calculate, if you

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:52.929
want, the energy of a
certain configuration,

00:34:52.929 --> 00:34:55.179
starting from a virtual crystal.

00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:57.880
But we haven't really-- and this
is a subtlety that I won't go

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:58.810
into the detail--

00:34:58.810 --> 00:35:00.580
we haven't really
taken into account

00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.390
that our sort of end
original products

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.010
have actually different
lattice parameters.

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.550
So in itself, at
the end, if we need

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:11.590
to understand phased
ability, we need

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:16.120
to understand what
is the lower Gibbs

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:18.340
free energy for our
problem, that is,

00:35:18.340 --> 00:35:21.010
if entropy drives
this configuration

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:24.610
to be stable, or, if you
want, if enthalpy and elastic

00:35:24.610 --> 00:35:27.250
interaction drive
segregation in two

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.310
compounds with different
lattice parameters

00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:31.990
to be the stable state.

00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:36.130
And of course, the closer
the lattice parameters

00:35:36.130 --> 00:35:40.090
are, the more irrelevant
this term is going to be

00:35:40.090 --> 00:35:42.370
and the more relevant
term in which

00:35:42.370 --> 00:35:44.170
the disorder atoms will be.

00:35:44.170 --> 00:35:47.930
And temperature is always
going to favor this.

00:35:47.930 --> 00:35:50.470
But this might
become very expensive

00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:53.500
if the original compounds
have very different lattice

00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.940
parameters, because
we really need

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.940
to stretch things
to start having

00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:00.640
the possibility of
mixing them together.

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:04.000
And all sort of-- the
phase diagonal stability

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.530
of this system is really driven
by these two competing sort

00:36:08.530 --> 00:36:11.470
of forces, the
temperature that want

00:36:11.470 --> 00:36:15.100
to mix up things
around but chemistry

00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.140
that, in order to
mix things around,

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.930
you need to have atoms that
are chemically very similar.

00:36:19.930 --> 00:36:22.000
And you need to have
lattice parameters that

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.960
are fairly similar, so that you
don't build up a lot of strain.

00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:31.225
And so, again, without
going into detail,

00:36:31.225 --> 00:36:33.440
it is actually very
easy to calculate

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.100
some of those elastic terms.

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:39.820
And so when we do that,
what we really have is a way

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:43.660
to calculate how much energy it
takes to stretch things so they

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.250
have the same sort of unit
cell and then how much--

00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.290
and that was the tricky part--

00:36:50.290 --> 00:36:52.870
it cost to mix things
around, it cost

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:55.750
to have a certain configuration.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:57.610
And the very nice
thing is that now, we

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:01.540
can sort of test our
perturbation theory approach

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:05.620
and compare it with full blown
density functional theory

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.170
calculations for
cells that are small

00:37:08.170 --> 00:37:11.410
enough so that you can actually
do a density functional theory

00:37:11.410 --> 00:37:12.220
calculation.

00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:13.750
These are older results.

00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:15.850
Now we could do
much larger cells.

00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.160
But the concept stands.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:22.060
We can do a full self-consistent
calculation, say,

00:37:22.060 --> 00:37:26.050
for a super lattice of
gallium planes and indium

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:30.360
planes in the 111 direction.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:33.020
And so we can calculate
what is the lattice

00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:35.630
parameter of this
structure and what

00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:38.000
is actually the sort
of Gibbs free energy

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.310
of mixing for this system.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:45.530
And we can do that with a
full explicit calculation,

00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:50.090
and we can do it with a set
of perturbation approach.

00:37:50.090 --> 00:37:53.330
And you see, we can compare the
equilibrium lattice parameters

00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.410
in both cases.

00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.810
And basically, the difference--
this is atomic units.

00:37:56.810 --> 00:37:59.900
This is PWSCF-- is
basically negligible.

00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.200
And the energies
are also very good.

00:38:03.200 --> 00:38:06.560
This sort of error that the
perturbation theory makes

00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:11.000
is actually here, just 1
millielectron volt per atom.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.740
And as you sort of
move around, you

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:16.025
see that there are lot of cases
in which the error is larger,

00:38:16.025 --> 00:38:19.800
4 millielectron volt.
And 4 millielectron

00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.770
volt is very small,
but it's still

00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:25.320
10% of this mixing free energy.

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:27.260
So it's sort of
somehow relevant.

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.920
But we, I would say,
still do very well.

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:34.250
And calculating this
energy of mixing

00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:36.890
is absolutely inexpensive.

00:38:36.890 --> 00:38:39.200
It takes a nanosecond
on your computer.

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.410
You just basically sum with
the appropriate configurational

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.780
variables the term with
your interaction constants.

00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:48.780
This requires a full
self-consistent calculation.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.770
So with this approach, you
can calculate the energies

00:38:51.770 --> 00:38:54.140
of millions of
structures that are

00:38:54.140 --> 00:38:56.810
very large, while with
this, you can only

00:38:56.810 --> 00:39:00.890
calculate tens of structures
that are reasonably small.

00:39:00.890 --> 00:39:06.650
So it's very appropriate to
use the linear response term

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:11.030
to then do-- to use one of these
statistical sampling methods

00:39:11.030 --> 00:39:13.700
that you have seen with
Professor [? Seder. ?]

00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.520
And again, I won't go
into detail, because you

00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.380
have seen them
partially, and you'll

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:20.730
see them over and over again.

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:23.420
But just to remind you
sort of the concepts,

00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.520
if you want to
understand what is

00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.240
the stability of a certain
structure, what you really

00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.160
need to compare are
their Gibbs free energy.

00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:35.690
So you want to operate into the
thermodynamic ensemble in which

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:38.300
you have constant pressure
and constant temperature,

00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:40.410
because that's really
what your experiment is.

00:39:40.410 --> 00:39:44.670
You're at a certain temperature,
and you let the system relax.

00:39:44.670 --> 00:39:47.900
And as usual, you
can't calculate--

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.270
explicitly, there
is not a formula

00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:52.470
that gives you free energy.

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:54.780
It's a logarithm of a
partitioned function.

00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:57.530
And so there are sort
of statistical ways

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:00.080
by which that can be calculated.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:03.320
And one of the most
powerful approaches

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:06.440
is that given by
thermodynamic integration.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:11.210
That really is based on the fact
that while we can't calculate

00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:13.790
free energy, we can
actually calculate

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.500
the derivative of free energy.

00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.000
So the derivative of the
free energy with a certain

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:23.070
parameter, like the
derivative of the free energy,

00:40:23.070 --> 00:40:25.610
the Gibbs free energy
with respect to the number

00:40:25.610 --> 00:40:30.560
of particles, is actually going
to be given by the ensemble

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.290
average-- that's when we
use the sort of brackets,

00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:35.480
the bracket sort of symbol--

00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.260
by the ensemble average of
the derivative of the energy

00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:41.500
with respect to the
number of particles.

00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:46.370
So that allows us to calculate
derivatives of free energy

00:40:46.370 --> 00:40:49.070
in the appropriate
thermodynamic ensemble.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:52.070
And so what we can do
is calculate free energy

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:56.930
differences by integrating
the derivative of free energy

00:40:56.930 --> 00:41:02.630
from state A and state B.
And obviously, this integral

00:41:02.630 --> 00:41:07.250
will be done by step-wise
calculating these derivatives

00:41:07.250 --> 00:41:09.090
at different points.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:11.450
But these derivatives, that
in the case of the Gibbs

00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:14.700
free energy with respect to the
number of particles, nothing

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.120
less than the chemical
potential as a function

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.990
of the concentration,
needs to be evaluated

00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:22.490
for every concentration.

00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:25.910
Say, in going from concentration
A to concentration B,

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.740
what we really
want to figure out

00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:31.070
is what is the free energy
difference between these two

00:41:31.070 --> 00:41:32.160
concentration.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.570
So each of these
points in this integral

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:40.070
requires an entire
statistical sampling and then

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:42.710
an entire statistical
simulation.

00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:49.480
And so this is what
you would actually do.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:54.790
You choose a temperature,
say, 1,000 kelvin,

00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:58.690
and you choose a pressure, say,
0 pressure or 1 atmosphere,

00:41:58.690 --> 00:42:01.930
that for all practical
purposes is 0.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:05.470
And then under these
conditions, you

00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:10.600
have your total energy expressed
in configurational variables.

00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:14.320
And you decide what is your
chemical potential, that is,

00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:18.160
what is sort of the
additional cost of switching

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:20.560
an atom from gallium to indium.

00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:23.020
And then you start with
your Monte Carlo sampling.

00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:25.600
You keep switching atoms
from gallium to indium

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.670
or from indium to gallium.

00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.430
Each of these switches
will have a certain energy

00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:34.840
cost that is weighed with
the Metropolis factor.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:39.310
And in this simulation,
at a given pressure

00:42:39.310 --> 00:42:41.800
and at a given
chemical potential,

00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:46.630
after of millions of sweeps and
millions of trials in which you

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:51.070
try to change a spin variable
from plus 1 or minus 1,

00:42:51.070 --> 00:42:54.850
you do this over and over again,
and you end up with a point

00:42:54.850 --> 00:43:00.130
there that tells you what is
the concentration of, say,

00:43:00.130 --> 00:43:05.140
gallium 0.9 for a given
chemical potential.

00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.780
And you repeat this
over and over again.

00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:12.070
That is, you sweep all your
possible chemical potential.

00:43:12.070 --> 00:43:15.490
And for each choice
of chemical potential,

00:43:15.490 --> 00:43:18.340
you get a certain
average concentration.

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.930
And so you do this
over and over again.

00:43:20.930 --> 00:43:24.250
And so you see, what
you get is a curve

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:28.480
that tells you what is the
concentration as a function

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.220
of the chemical potential.

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:34.060
And you get one of these
curves for each temperature

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:36.080
at which you do the simulation.

00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:40.270
So you get concentration as a
function of chemical potential.

00:43:40.270 --> 00:43:43.480
And if we go back for a
moment to the previous slide,

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.580
this is really the
inverse of what you need.

00:43:46.580 --> 00:43:48.580
You need the
thermodynamic integration

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.710
to calculate the free energy
difference between two

00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:56.080
concentration, the integral of
the average chemical potential

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.160
for a given concentration.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.550
So the only thing
that you have to do

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:11.200
is, really, look at this curve,
turn it around if you want to,

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.300
so that you have x
as a function of mu.

00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.860
And say, for the
1,000 kelvin case,

00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:22.690
you'll have something like this.

00:44:22.690 --> 00:44:25.650
So you have sort of inverted--

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:28.500
your simulations have given
you concentration as a function

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.760
of chemical potential.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:32.670
You invert that, and
you integrate it,

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:36.480
and you get a free energy curve.

00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:39.000
And you see, things
get interesting

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.960
when you start being below
a critical temperature.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:45.030
So you see, we got 820 kelvin.

00:44:45.030 --> 00:44:48.960
And you really see that the
curve is still continuous,

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:53.550
but it sort of starts to have
a slope in the middle that

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:55.960
is going towards infinity.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:45:02.190
And if we go below, at
650 kelvin, what happens

00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.610
is that we have opened
a miscibility gap.

00:45:05.610 --> 00:45:12.450
That is, there is a region of
concentrations from 0.1 to 0.8

00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:14.490
that never appear.

00:45:14.490 --> 00:45:19.080
So at 650 kelvin,
this system doesn't

00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:25.680
want to mix in the concentration
regime between 0.8 and 0.1.

00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.260
And this is typical
of model alloys.

00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.990
Miscibility gap has opened.

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:32.820
The two things don't mix.

00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:38.460
And if you think at sort of
how your curve could look like,

00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:41.430
we could sort of
somehow interpolate

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:46.740
in some arbitrary way this
curve and then invert it.

00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:48.510
And when you
integrate the data--

00:45:52.310 --> 00:45:57.220
it seems that the
computer has gone mad.

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:01.080
And let's see.

00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.330
OK, we'll keep
the green forever.

00:46:03.330 --> 00:46:06.600
It's now in the realm
of the computer.

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.700
But this is good, because
when you invert this

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.280
and you integrate,
what you see is

00:46:11.280 --> 00:46:15.090
that for your free energy as a
function of the concentration--

00:46:15.090 --> 00:46:16.920
is that what you
would really obtain

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:23.130
is real free energies only
from 0 to 0.1 or from between 1

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:26.370
and something like 0.8, 0.85.

00:46:26.370 --> 00:46:29.820
And in the middle, you have
this famous miscibility

00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:34.530
gap in which, really, the free
energy of the solid solution

00:46:34.530 --> 00:46:38.640
is higher than the free
energy of the n compounds.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.280
And so you have the max
error and the tangent.

00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.490
And so what you have is the
composition of your system.

00:46:45.490 --> 00:46:47.520
And so you can calculate
your phase diagram.

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:51.090
And at the end, for this system,
it would really look like this.

00:46:51.090 --> 00:46:55.470
Below 820 kelvin, you
open a miscibility gap

00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:57.150
in which, really,
the two systems

00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:58.700
don't want to mix together.

00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.260
And so in many ways,
semiconductor alloys

00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:04.500
are really model solutions.

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:07.890
And below the
critical temperature,

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.750
they start to segregate.

00:47:09.750 --> 00:47:14.250
And of course, you can do a
lot of other intriguing things.

00:47:14.250 --> 00:47:18.000
That is, in your simulation,
you figure out, say,

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.270
what is the
distributions of, say,

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:25.320
gallium-phosphorus distance
or indium-phosphorus distances

00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:28.410
at any given concentrations.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:30.420
And what you
actually discover is

00:47:30.420 --> 00:47:34.200
that there is a sort of
very bimodal distribution,

00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:37.230
that there are short
distances with the phosphorus,

00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:39.660
and there are long distance
with the phosphorus-- that

00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:42.240
are, of course, due
to the fact that these

00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.790
are gallium-phosphorus
distances and these are

00:47:44.790 --> 00:47:46.530
indium-phosphorus distances.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:49.680
But they sort of depends
with the concentration.

00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:52.300
But those are things
that can be measured.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.930
And so in this
sort of graph, I've

00:47:54.930 --> 00:48:00.150
put an example of what
are the numbers that we

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:03.450
get from the Monte
Carlo simulations

00:48:03.450 --> 00:48:07.710
on the Ising Hamiltonian and
what are actually the EXAES

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:10.440
results that people measure.

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:12.880
And you see, there is really
a very good agreement.

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:16.380
Say, these are the short
gallium phosphide distances

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.900
as a function of
concentration between what

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:24.330
the experiment measure and what
your thermodynamical DFT is

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:26.160
actually predicting.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:30.630
And I think I'll skip this.

00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:33.420
There were some other details
about epitaxial system.

00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.220
But otherwise, I'm
worried I won't

00:48:35.220 --> 00:48:37.860
be able to do the second part.

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:42.180
So this was the first example.

00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:45.150
Again, what is important
there is that we

00:48:45.150 --> 00:48:47.220
have a physical problem.

00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:51.330
We have identified what are the
important degrees of freedom,

00:48:51.330 --> 00:48:54.900
and we have calculated
those degrees of freedom

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:57.750
from calculations that
are actually manageable.

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:00.180
But those degrees of
freedom in those calculation

00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:04.260
have given us the parameter of a
Hamiltonian that, in this case,

00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:07.920
was a Ising-like long range
Hamiltonian in which we

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:12.720
can do sort of much more complex
statistical mechanics analysis.

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:16.850
And so we can actually
obtain phase diagrams.

00:49:16.850 --> 00:49:18.780
That was one example.

00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:20.630
The other example that
I want to show you

00:49:20.630 --> 00:49:24.360
here is instead how
we sort of repeat

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.290
the same process
in order instead

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:33.050
to calculate Hamiltonians that
have a linear scaling cost.

00:49:33.050 --> 00:49:35.750
That is, that allow
us to calculate

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:37.760
the electronic
structure and energies

00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.800
of systems that
are really large,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:44.450
that are sort of thousands or
tens of thousands of atoms.

00:49:44.450 --> 00:49:47.220
And you know, this is because
this comes from some research

00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.320
example.

00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.900
We were interested
in sort of studying

00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:55.010
what is the effect
on a carbon nanotube

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:57.200
of organic functionalization.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.950
That is, what happens
if we take a ligand--

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:02.950
this would be--
it's a benzene ring.

00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:05.900
So again, let's kind of
call it phenyl moiety.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:10.460
And this sort of ring is
attached with a covalent bond

00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.130
to an infinitely
longer carbon nanotube.

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:14.673
And people have
started doing this.

00:50:14.673 --> 00:50:16.340
And of course, when
it happens, what you

00:50:16.340 --> 00:50:20.540
have is a nanotube
that has a random array

00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.770
of these funny rings.

00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:25.760
So again, we have the
thermodynamical problem

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:29.930
of finding out what is the
effect of this configuration

00:50:29.930 --> 00:50:32.840
of this order on some of
the intriguing properties

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:34.280
of the carbon nanotube.

00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:37.160
Like, there are sort
of ballistic electrical

00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:40.190
conductivity, that is
electrical conductivity, that

00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:44.180
is independent of
length, so very different

00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.980
from an ohmic conductor--

00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:49.250
or what is their
thermal conductivity.

00:50:49.250 --> 00:50:53.090
But again, we really don't have
the computational resources,

00:50:53.090 --> 00:50:55.550
and no one has the
computational resources

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.190
to study, with density
functional theory, a system

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:01.520
with tens of thousands of atoms.

00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:05.030
And you'll see this in sort
of the last part of the class,

00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.720
really.

00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:08.850
It's not just a matter of
waiting a few more years.

00:51:08.850 --> 00:51:13.410
I mean, the scaling cost
kills us in many ways.

00:51:13.410 --> 00:51:16.610
So we really need to
use sort of ingenuity.

00:51:16.610 --> 00:51:21.440
And what we are going to
use here is this idea.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:24.950
We want to break away from
this orthonormalization

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:27.740
constraint that is
really what drives

00:51:27.740 --> 00:51:30.170
the cubic scaling of a system.

00:51:30.170 --> 00:51:34.010
That is, what we want
to do is using a system

00:51:34.010 --> 00:51:37.250
as sort of picture
in which we really

00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:41.780
look at Kohn-Sham orbitals
that are localized,

00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:47.000
so we don't have to worry about
orthonormality with orbitals

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.230
that are far away.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:51.920
Because if two orbitals are
far away, and both of them

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:55.850
are localized, their
overlap is going to be 0.

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:59.000
And so they are
orthogonal by default,

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:04.820
without us having to
sort of impose that.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:06.680
And the way we are
going to do this

00:52:06.680 --> 00:52:11.200
is, again, a mapping from the
full density functional theory

00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:12.450
calculation.

00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:13.460
So we start--

00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.880
I'm giving you here
the example of silicon.

00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:20.360
If you look at the band
structure of silicon,

00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.500
again, what you have
are very localized

00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.680
core orbitals down there
that don't really have

00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:28.930
any effect on the chemistry.

00:52:28.930 --> 00:52:30.800
They corresponds to flat bands.

00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:34.280
But what is interesting is
what the valence electrons do,

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.890
and this is sort of the
very celebrated band

00:52:36.890 --> 00:52:38.480
structure of silicon.

00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:42.650
This in particular is the
gamma point, so at 0, 0, 0.

00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:45.350
And so because
silicon has two atoms

00:52:45.350 --> 00:52:48.860
per unit cell, four
valence electrons per atom,

00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:54.560
we have eight valence electrons.

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.670
Spin the generator.

00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:58.880
So we have bands that
contain two electrons each.

00:53:02.910 --> 00:53:03.410
Sorry.

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:11.300
So what we have is
four valence bands.

00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.220
And you see, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:15.380
As we move around
the Brillouin zone,

00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:17.300
they can become the generator.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:21.110
And those that are studying
semiconductor physics,

00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:24.530
they will know that this is
the top of the valence band,

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:27.230
and we have heavy
holes and light holes

00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:31.010
depending on the
curvature up here.

00:53:31.010 --> 00:53:33.620
But so what is the electronic
structure of our problem?

00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:40.640
Well, remember, the band
index and the quasimomentum k

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:42.500
across the Brillouin
zone are really

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:46.160
the quantum numbers for the
crystal, for my problem.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.860
If I study a
molecule, and I have

00:53:48.860 --> 00:53:53.420
a molecule with eight electrons,
I will have only four--

00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.730
in the case of spin degeneracy--

00:53:55.730 --> 00:53:58.440
eigenstates that are occupied.

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.520
If, instead of studying a
molecule with eight electrons,

00:54:01.520 --> 00:54:05.150
I study a crystal with eight
electrons per unit cell,

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:09.740
instead of having four
states, I have four bands.

00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:13.100
And the energy of
each eigenstate,

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:15.860
thanks to Bloch theorem,
can be cataloged

00:54:15.860 --> 00:54:20.840
depending on this band index and
depending on the quasimomentum.

00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.330
And the quasimomentum
really sort of tells me

00:54:23.330 --> 00:54:27.590
how the phase of things changes
when we go from one unit cell

00:54:27.590 --> 00:54:28.580
to the other.

00:54:28.580 --> 00:54:31.550
The same concept takes
place also not in--

00:54:31.550 --> 00:54:35.150
for the electronic eigenstates
but for the normal modes,

00:54:35.150 --> 00:54:36.890
for the phonon
modes of a crystal.

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:40.190
We classify them
according to wavelength

00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:43.040
and according to band index.

00:54:43.040 --> 00:54:48.200
And so your infinite number
of electrons in the crystal

00:54:48.200 --> 00:54:52.550
can all sort of be summarized
in this picture, in which we

00:54:52.550 --> 00:54:55.940
have a continuum of states.

00:54:55.940 --> 00:54:57.740
So if you want, we
have mapped the fact

00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:01.280
that we had eight electrons
repeated infinitely

00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.750
into a problem in which we have
eight electrons, that is four

00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:09.020
bands, with a sort of
continuum variation,

00:55:09.020 --> 00:55:12.810
depending on which
wavelength we are looking at.

00:55:12.810 --> 00:55:15.830
And so this picture
sort of represents

00:55:15.830 --> 00:55:21.020
all the possible occupied
states in your system

00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:25.790
that are infinite but are
classified in a group of four

00:55:25.790 --> 00:55:28.850
with a continuum index k.

00:55:28.850 --> 00:55:32.210
Now, the interesting things
about quantum mechanics

00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:35.780
is that you can change
your representation

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:37.950
and still look at
the same problem.

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:40.010
It's the same thing in
classical mechanics.

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:42.890
If you are sort of studying
something in three dimension,

00:55:42.890 --> 00:55:45.420
you can rotate your
coordinate system.

00:55:45.420 --> 00:55:47.420
And so your equation
of motion will change.

00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.040
Your trajectory will change.

00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:52.760
But really, you are just
moving everything accordingly,

00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:54.680
and you are looking
at the same problem

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:58.040
in a different
coordinate system.

00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:01.460
That is even more true in
quantum mechanics, in which you

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:05.900
can perform a unitary
transformation between all

00:56:05.900 --> 00:56:09.800
your eigenstates and still
look at the same problem.

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.500
Usually, what we
sort of choose to be

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.180
is into a
representation in which

00:56:14.180 --> 00:56:17.090
we are looking at eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian.

00:56:17.090 --> 00:56:20.450
So each of these
states here is exactly

00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:23.720
the characteristic of being an
eigenstate of the Hamiltonian.

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.060
You apply the Hamiltonian
to that state.

00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:28.310
What you obtain
is a constant that

00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:31.500
is the energy eigenvalue
times the state itself.

00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:34.520
But we can mix this
around, and we can still

00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:38.870
look at the same problem, just
in a different representation.

00:56:38.870 --> 00:56:41.660
Exactly as in
classical mechanics,

00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:43.700
we can do an orthogonal
transformation

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.830
of our coordinate system and
look at the same problem.

00:56:46.830 --> 00:56:52.130
So what we can do is actually
do a unitary transformation,

00:56:52.130 --> 00:56:55.040
a unitary rotation,
of our orbitals

00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:57.770
and still look at
the same problem.

00:56:57.770 --> 00:57:03.230
And again, without really going
into the details of what it is

00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:05.180
and what quantum
mechanics is, it's

00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.160
something that would
look like this.

00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:13.130
That is, if we start from our
eigenstates, at each k point--

00:57:13.130 --> 00:57:15.830
that is, at each point
in the Brillouin zone--

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:20.750
if we have those four bands,
we can mix them together

00:57:20.750 --> 00:57:22.580
with a unitary transformation.

00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:27.260
But not only that, we can
sort of mix those mixed bands

00:57:27.260 --> 00:57:30.890
with all the other bands
at different k points

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:32.840
with the appropriate
unitary factor.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:37.310
And so what we can obtain is
a new set of orbitals that

00:57:37.310 --> 00:57:41.270
are, again, infinite and
that really represent

00:57:41.270 --> 00:57:43.820
the same quantum
mechanical problem,

00:57:43.820 --> 00:57:46.280
just sort of turned it around.

00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.740
And our quantum
numbers that before,

00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:53.330
where the band index
and the quasimomentum

00:57:53.330 --> 00:58:00.090
become some new quantum
numbers, that will be-- again,

00:58:00.090 --> 00:58:02.880
one of them will be
related to the bands.

00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:07.080
So for silicon,
we'll go from 1 to 4.

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.560
And the other one will
count all the sort

00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:12.510
of infinite number
of electrons that we

00:58:12.510 --> 00:58:16.050
have when we go from one
isolated unit cell to one unit

00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:18.060
cell periodically repeated.

00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:21.600
And before, what we had
was a quasicontinuum,

00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.490
basically, of wavelengths.

00:58:23.490 --> 00:58:26.160
And in this new
representation, what we

00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:30.090
have is a quasicontinuum
of localization vectors.

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:34.650
So we go from extended
Bloch orbitals

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:36.960
that are eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian

00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:42.570
to localized orbitals in which
the electron is sitting in each

00:58:42.570 --> 00:58:44.640
of the different unit cells.

00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:48.390
And really, this is an
arbitrary transformation.

00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:52.020
And these matrices are
sort of our parameters,

00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:55.740
the sort of quantum mechanical
equivalent of the three Euler

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:59.220
angles that rotate the
Cartesian system from one

00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:01.090
representation to another.

00:59:01.090 --> 00:59:05.860
And so we can choose, say,
this set of transformation,

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:10.740
so that what we obtain is the
same quantum mechanical picture

00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:15.480
but in a representation that
is as localized as possible.

00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:19.650
And how we do that sort of
requires a lot of algebra.

00:59:19.650 --> 00:59:23.280
But this is the sort of
very intriguing result

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.500
that takes place when we
actually make it in practice.

00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:30.960
We take-- again, all these
states and each of them

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.220
is delocalized.

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:35.040
It's Bloch orbital
energy eigenstates

00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.920
that is extended over
the whole crystal.

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:41.760
We mix all these things
together with a criterion

00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.470
that those mixing
transformation are

00:59:43.470 --> 00:59:46.980
chosen so that the new states
are as localized as possible.

00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:50.010
And what we obtain at the
end is fairly beautiful.

00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:53.610
If we look at, say, something
like silicon, again,

00:59:53.610 --> 00:59:56.820
sort of a perennial
diamond structure,

00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:59.850
one silicon atom
fourfold coordinated

00:59:59.850 --> 01:00:02.130
with the other silicon atoms--

01:00:02.130 --> 01:00:11.060
and it's a bit difficult to
see, but what we would have

01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:14.930
is that one silicon
atom, in red,

01:00:14.930 --> 01:00:20.210
is connected to
four silicon atoms.

01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:22.895
And this blue over
blue silicon atom

01:00:22.895 --> 01:00:27.510
is connected to other
four silicon atoms.

01:00:31.400 --> 01:00:35.150
And the localized
orbital that you obtain

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:42.050
is really what the chemist would
have told us probably in 1930.

01:00:42.050 --> 01:00:47.480
It's really a covalent bond
between the two orbitals.

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.870
So what we have is that
these two atoms here

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:54.050
are connected by an
orbital that has,

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:59.750
really, this pile up of covalent
charge between those two atoms.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:04.400
And there is a certain amount
of sort of back-bonding

01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:08.180
between each of those two
atoms and the remaining three

01:01:08.180 --> 01:01:09.290
neighbors.

01:01:09.290 --> 01:01:13.820
So this is how the localized
orbital looks like.

01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:17.720
And that's been just obtained
by a unitary transformation.

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:20.370
But when we have
this player here,

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:23.120
it becomes very easy
now to construct

01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.640
the electronic structure
of a system that

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:29.420
might have some amount of
configurational disorder.

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:32.300
Because, if instead
of having somewhere,

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:35.420
say, silicon-silicon in an
infinite silicon matrix,

01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.930
we have maybe gallium and
arsenic for a moment locally.

01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:42.600
Well, maybe what we can do, and
I'll show you how we'll do it,

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:46.550
maybe we can put there the
exact orbital corresponding

01:01:46.550 --> 01:01:48.890
to the gallium arsenic bond.

01:01:48.890 --> 01:01:52.860
And if you look at it, it's
actually going to be-- again,

01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:54.950
because things are
similar, it's going

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:58.370
to be very similar to
the silicon orbital.

01:01:58.370 --> 01:02:00.740
The gallium arsenic
covalent bonds

01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:03.140
is just, because
of the difference

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:07.370
of electronic activity,
sort of tilted more

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:12.500
towards the electronegative
arsenic in this problem.

01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:15.440
Or say, again, to
give you the feeling,

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.700
it's nothing less than the sort
of standard chemical picture.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:22.820
If we have a system
that is still silicon,

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:24.560
but it's amorphous silicon--

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:26.900
and I've got here atoms around.

01:02:26.900 --> 01:02:28.640
But amorphous
silicon is something

01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:31.970
in which a tetrahedral
short range holder is still

01:02:31.970 --> 01:02:36.530
preserved on average but
long range holder is lost.

01:02:36.530 --> 01:02:40.220
Well, atoms that are
tetrahedrally coordinated

01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:43.850
won't have a perfect
109 degrees angles,

01:02:43.850 --> 01:02:48.780
but their bonds still
look very much like those.

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:52.020
And sometimes, you have atoms
that are five-fold coordinated.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.200
And so they have their own bond.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:55.940
And if you want,
these are really

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:59.270
what we call the LEGO bricks
of electronic structure.

01:02:59.270 --> 01:03:01.730
That is, in a very
complex system,

01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:03.350
the electronic
structure of the system

01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:07.940
is going to be made up locally
by the appropriate orbitals

01:03:07.940 --> 01:03:10.700
that corresponds to
the local environment.

01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:14.150
And the nature and physics
is inherently local,

01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:17.360
so there is a large
degree of transferability.

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.390
And again, to give you a sort
of more feeling for this,

01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:23.900
suppose that instead of
looking at a crystal,

01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.340
we look at a molecule.

01:03:25.340 --> 01:03:28.100
We look at something
like a benzene ring.

01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:30.620
And you go to a representation
in which states, instead

01:03:30.620 --> 01:03:33.050
of being eigenstates
of the Hamiltonian,

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:34.910
are localized states.

01:03:34.910 --> 01:03:38.600
What you see are electronic
states that are really

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:42.110
carbon-hydrogen
single bonds, or what

01:03:42.110 --> 01:03:47.390
you see are carbon-carbon
single bonds, or what you see

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:50.610
are carbon-carbon
double bonds, in which

01:03:50.610 --> 01:03:54.530
you have both this orbital
and this reflection

01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:58.800
across the symmetry plane
of the benzene molecule.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:02.210
So really, what you are seeing
is very intuitive chemical

01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:03.110
picture.

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:07.190
But the way it's been
obtained is actually

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:12.530
from an exact transformation of
our quantum mechanical problem,

01:04:12.530 --> 01:04:14.570
solving density functional
theory, that is,

01:04:14.570 --> 01:04:17.300
with a certain
degree of accuracy.

01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:20.030
And we'll see now
how we apply this

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:23.540
to the case of carbon nanotubes,
because what we really

01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.500
want to do is study chemical
disorder on these carbon

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.300
nanotubes.

01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.800
And carbon nanotube is nothing
else than a sheet of graphite--

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.650
that is what is called
the graphene sheet--

01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:40.770
that has been rolled over
together to create a tube.

01:04:40.770 --> 01:04:43.490
So if you take this
hexagonal lattice,

01:04:43.490 --> 01:04:48.020
there are sort of discrete
infinite way of rolling things

01:04:48.020 --> 01:04:48.980
together.

01:04:48.980 --> 01:04:51.710
And the way the carbon
nanotube community

01:04:51.710 --> 01:04:54.620
has agreed to sort
of use a nomenclature

01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:59.090
is by defining what is
called a chiral vector, that,

01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:03.930
in this case here,
would be this CH vector.

01:05:03.930 --> 01:05:08.900
So if, on a graphene
sheet, you define a vector,

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.630
that is really just
an integer number

01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:17.330
of times the two a1 and a2
primitive lattice vectors--

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:20.780
that is, once you have
defined this green CH,

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:23.720
you have defined your
nanotube, by saying

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:26.720
that you are cutting
the graphene sheet

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:31.110
perpendicular to this vector
and rolling what you have cut,

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:34.650
so that the top of the
vector touches the bottom.

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:38.280
And so you have sort
of a perfect cylinder.

01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:40.380
And then there is
a nomenclature.

01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:44.070
And you can sort of--
a generic nanotube

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:48.750
will be called armchair,
zig-zag, or chiral nanotube,

01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:52.080
depending on how you have
rolled things around.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:57.520
And so if your chiral
vector is an n number of a1s

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:01.680
and an n number of a2,
equal, your chiral vector

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.240
will be this blue vector here.

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.420
And so what you
are going to do is,

01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:09.180
you are going to
roll the nanotube so

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:12.540
that perpendicular to the
direction of the tube,

01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:17.070
you can clearly see this
sort of zig-zag pattern.

01:06:17.070 --> 01:06:18.750
And so an armchair--

01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:24.450
sorry, a zig-zag-- oh, sorry.

01:06:24.450 --> 01:06:28.540
A zig-zag nanotube
is the one in which

01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.910
you have a chiral
vector that is made

01:06:30.910 --> 01:06:34.510
by an integer number
of times a1 and zero

01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:36.890
number a2 or vice versa.

01:06:36.890 --> 01:06:40.090
So in the form n, 0 or 0, m.

01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:44.500
And so you see, this blue
vector for the zig-zag

01:06:44.500 --> 01:06:48.430
is going to be 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 times a1.

01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:51.700
So this will be the
zig-zag nanotube,

01:06:51.700 --> 01:06:53.950
and you see this
zig-zag pattern.

01:06:53.950 --> 01:07:01.390
If, instead, you choose n for
a1 equal to the n for a2, what

01:07:01.390 --> 01:07:04.900
you have is a vector that
goes in this direction,

01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.860
like the red vector here.

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:09.550
And so what you are
doing is actually

01:07:09.550 --> 01:07:12.760
sort of cutting the
nanotube like this

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.650
and rolling it together.

01:07:14.650 --> 01:07:19.090
And again, now perpendicular
to the axis of the nanotube,

01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:20.950
you see this pattern.

01:07:20.950 --> 01:07:23.470
That is called an
armchair pattern.

01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:27.500
And so an armchair nanotube is
identified by these two quantum

01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.000
numbers.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.010
And then identical
zig-zag is n, 0 or 0, n.

01:07:32.010 --> 01:07:36.070
And everything else has a
sort of more ordered chirality

01:07:36.070 --> 01:07:40.960
and is called, generically
speaking, a chiral nanotube.

01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.060
OK, so this is how
they look like.

01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:46.100
You see, a zig-zag, very
long in this direction.

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.370
We cut it, we see
the zig-zag pattern.

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:52.570
An armchair, we cut, and we see
that sort of hexagonal pattern

01:07:52.570 --> 01:07:56.380
that, for some reason,
is called an armchair.

01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:58.960
And now the
interesting bit comes

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:03.910
when we look at the band
structure of this system.

01:08:03.910 --> 01:08:07.780
We could have started, say, from
the band structure of graphite

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.200
or graphene, in which,
again, the Brillouin zone--

01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:14.560
the extended Brillouin
zone is this hexagon.

01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:18.040
And what happens is a bit
difficult to visualize.

01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:20.140
But actually, what
happens is that there

01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.510
are only six points--

01:08:22.510 --> 01:08:24.640
so the black dots there--

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:30.040
at which they are
unoccupied states

01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:32.420
touch the occupied states.

01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:36.880
So usually-- and we have
seen it over and over again--

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.340
in something like
a metal, we will

01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.640
have maybe a band like this.

01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:48.550
And then we'll have Fermi energy
that cuts the occupied states

01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:50.350
from the unoccupied states.

01:08:50.350 --> 01:08:54.790
In graphite, the band
dispersion is much more exotic.

01:08:54.790 --> 01:08:56.770
It actually looks like this.

01:08:56.770 --> 01:08:58.930
In certain points of
the Brillouin zone,

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:02.380
it's actually sort
of straight lines.

01:09:02.380 --> 01:09:04.010
You'll see it in a moment.

01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:07.750
And the Fermi surface
is exactly here.

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:10.300
So there is only-- the
Fermi energy is here.

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.609
The Fermi surface is on a point.

01:09:12.609 --> 01:09:15.880
And seen from
above, if you want,

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.130
these are where these combs
are that I've sort of cut there

01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:22.479
in a profile.

01:09:22.479 --> 01:09:26.680
What happens when you go
from graphene to a nanotube?

01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:28.330
Well, instead of
having a system that

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:33.189
is infinitely B-dimensional,
you get a system in which,

01:09:33.189 --> 01:09:36.130
by rolling one of
the dimensions, what

01:09:36.130 --> 01:09:39.790
you do actually is you
quantize your quantum

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:41.583
numbers in one direction.

01:09:41.583 --> 01:09:43.000
So you still have
a Brillouin zone

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.540
that is a continuum in the
direction of the tube axis.

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:50.229
But because you have rolled it,
maybe you have only 10 hexagons

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:53.439
instead of an infinite number
of hexagons in the direction

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:55.150
perpendicular to the axis.

01:09:55.150 --> 01:09:57.280
Now, what you are
effectively doing

01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:01.210
is really looking at the
band structure only along

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:05.290
a certain number of cuts
of this Brillouin zone.

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:09.460
And so depending on how you roll
your system, what you can have

01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:14.530
is that this subset of
lines that corresponds

01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:17.890
to having a continuum
index in one direction

01:10:17.890 --> 01:10:21.250
become a discrete index,
because in one direction,

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:24.940
we go from infinite hexagon to
a finite number of hexagons.

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:27.790
And so depending on
how many and what

01:10:27.790 --> 01:10:30.130
is the orientation
of the cut, we

01:10:30.130 --> 01:10:34.730
can have that these lines cross
or do not cross these points.

01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:38.590
And if they cross those points,
we'll have a metallic nanotube.

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:41.740
If they don't, we'll have
a semiconducting nanotube.

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:44.950
So just a very slight
change in orientation

01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:48.640
in the chirality vector might
allow us to miss this point

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.910
and make something that was
metallic into a semiconductor.

01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:54.460
And the rule to remember
this is trivial.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.740
If the difference
between the indices

01:10:56.740 --> 01:11:00.040
is 0 or a multiple of
three, your nanotube

01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.080
is going to be metallic.

01:11:02.080 --> 01:11:03.790
Otherwise, it's semiconducting.

01:11:03.790 --> 01:11:07.240
So say, all armchair
nanotubes are metallic,

01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:11.290
because m is equal to n,
so the difference is 0.

01:11:11.290 --> 01:11:13.330
So they are metallic.

01:11:13.330 --> 01:11:17.290
Zig-zag nanotubes,
well, only 1 out of 3

01:11:17.290 --> 01:11:19.420
is going to be metallic.

01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:21.190
6, 0 is going to be metallic.

01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:23.350
7, 0, 8, 0 are semiconducting.

01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:26.570
9, 0 is metallic, and
so on and so forth.

01:11:26.570 --> 01:11:29.470
And this sort of
only breaks down

01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:31.930
when we have very
narrow nanotubes

01:11:31.930 --> 01:11:35.680
in which this sort of model
picture of what is called band

01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:39.380
folding starts to break apart,
because the way we have thought

01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:43.750
of the nanotube is as being
identical to a perfect sheet

01:11:43.750 --> 01:11:48.400
of graphene that has been
quantized in one direction.

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.120
But really, there is curvature.

01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:53.000
And if the nanotube is narrow,
there is a lot of curvature.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.620
And so that sort of might change
things around a little bit.

01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:58.060
But so here is an example.

01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.790
You see, if you have
a metallic nanotube,

01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:04.720
like in this case, when you
quantize it in one direction,

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:06.850
you are rolling it,
you actually end up

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:10.430
with lines that go
through the black points.

01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:14.170
And so what you have is that
your band structure there

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:19.120
sort of sees these cones
of the graphite system.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:22.750
If you have, say, in this case
a semiconducting a0 system, when

01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:25.600
you quantize anything in
that perpendicular direction,

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:28.510
your lines actually do not
go through the black points.

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:32.020
And so you never
encounter a corner,

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:34.180
and you never find that gap.

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.580
And again, a very slight
change in orientation

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:40.210
can give you a very variable
gap and can bring you

01:12:40.210 --> 01:12:43.750
to be metallic very quickly.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:46.770
And so we start really going
again into the details.

01:12:46.770 --> 01:12:52.650
We really need to take
all our occupied states--

01:12:52.650 --> 01:12:55.590
that is, the one below
here that I'm not showing,

01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:58.590
everything below
the Fermi energy

01:12:58.590 --> 01:13:01.110
that is here for this
metallic nanotube--

01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:04.620
and we actually want to take
a little bit of the states

01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:08.220
above, because those
are also important.

01:13:08.220 --> 01:13:12.450
And with all these states, the
red, the blue, and the black--

01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:15.540
so all of the occupied states
and a bit of the unoccupied

01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:16.110
one--

01:13:16.110 --> 01:13:19.290
we want to sort of
mix them together

01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:24.870
and find what are the localized
orbitals coming from this.

01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:30.660
And I won't go into the details
on how we sort of extracted

01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:34.740
those when you have some of the
discontinuity that comes about

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:35.730
in a metal.

01:13:35.730 --> 01:13:37.890
But so basically,
what's happening

01:13:37.890 --> 01:13:40.350
is that we start from
our electronic structure

01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:43.170
calculation, maybe of
the carbon nanotube

01:13:43.170 --> 01:13:46.680
with a functionalized ligand.

01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.830
And in a new quantum
mechanical representation,

01:13:49.830 --> 01:13:53.130
what we have obtained are
sort of the building blocks

01:13:53.130 --> 01:13:55.890
of the pristine nanotube,
and the building

01:13:55.890 --> 01:14:01.080
blocks of the ligand, and
things like what is exactly

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.510
the orbital that
connects a carbon

01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:06.900
atom in the ligand to a
carbon atom in the sidewall,

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:10.270
with sort of full first
principle precision.

01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:12.690
And so with these blocks
now, we can actually

01:14:12.690 --> 01:14:16.590
construct not only
the band structure

01:14:16.590 --> 01:14:19.410
and the electronic structure
of this system periodically

01:14:19.410 --> 01:14:24.030
repeated, but also a system in
which the ligand is first here,

01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:27.630
here, and then here, with
all the chemical disorder

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:28.900
that we want.

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:32.340
And because the orbitals do
not overlap with each other,

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:38.190
the computational cost of doing
this is very, very reduced.

01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:40.860
Because basically, in
our new representation,

01:14:40.860 --> 01:14:45.270
orbitals that are far away are
orthogonal with each other,

01:14:45.270 --> 01:14:48.210
when we actually represent
the Hamiltonian--

01:14:48.210 --> 01:14:51.210
remember, in a lot of
your PWSCF calculation,

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:53.190
you have represented
the Hamiltonian

01:14:53.190 --> 01:14:55.890
in a plane wave basis set.

01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:58.050
And so in a plane
wave basis set,

01:14:58.050 --> 01:15:01.880
your Hamiltonian has the
diagonally dominant part,

01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:03.720
that is g squared over 2.

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:07.080
But then it also terms
all over the place

01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:10.110
that corresponds to the Fourier
transform of the potential.

01:15:10.110 --> 01:15:14.370
When we actually
represent the Hamiltonian

01:15:14.370 --> 01:15:18.150
on this basis of localized
orbitals, what you have

01:15:18.150 --> 01:15:21.510
is that this is truly
diagonally dominant.

01:15:21.510 --> 01:15:24.690
And as soon as we
consider orbitals

01:15:24.690 --> 01:15:27.070
that are far away
from each other,

01:15:27.070 --> 01:15:30.220
there is no Hamiltonian
matrix between them.

01:15:30.220 --> 01:15:32.910
If we calculate the matrix
element between this,

01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:34.920
the Hamiltonian,
and this green one,

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.620
it's going to be 0, because
they really do not overlap.

01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:42.660
So this is what is called a
sparse diagonally dominant

01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:43.620
Hamiltonian.

01:15:43.620 --> 01:15:46.380
And diagonalizing
this is something

01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:49.500
that actually doesn't
require cubic scaling

01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:51.500
but only requires
linear scaling.

01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.800
So one can really sort of
study very large systems.

01:15:55.800 --> 01:15:59.430
And to show you an
enlargement of a cutout

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:03.130
from a perfect nanotube, you
see, this is what you get.

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:08.550
You get orbitals that look
either as beautiful sort

01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:12.210
of bonding combination
of sp2 orbitals--

01:16:12.210 --> 01:16:14.220
if you think, we
know from chemistry

01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:17.280
that the carbon
is sp2 hybridized.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.800
So it means that the
graphitic backbone

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:22.170
is given by a
bonding combination

01:16:22.170 --> 01:16:26.160
of an sp2 orbital sitting
here and an sp2 sitting here.

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.050
And the same happens here.

01:16:28.050 --> 01:16:33.730
And then there is a set of pz
orbitals sitting on each tube.

01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:35.580
And when those
mix together, they

01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:39.490
give rise to the metallic
graphitic-like bonds.

01:16:39.490 --> 01:16:42.360
And again, this looks a
lot like a pz orbital,

01:16:42.360 --> 01:16:47.070
but it is nowhere similar to
the pz orbital of a carbon atom.

01:16:47.070 --> 01:16:51.220
It's the pz orbital specific
to a carbon nanotube.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:54.390
So with this, we
can-- as previously

01:16:54.390 --> 01:16:58.290
in the case of the alloys, we
can first validate our system.

01:16:58.290 --> 01:17:00.540
That is, we can
start constructing

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:02.550
the electronic
structure of something

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:05.730
that we can also fully
calculate from first principle.

01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:09.060
And we can compare them
and these continuous lines

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:13.380
from the models and dots
from the full calculation.

01:17:13.380 --> 01:17:16.230
And you see, the
model works perfectly

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:19.920
and doesn't describe
the higher energy

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.900
bonds that have
not been included

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:25.020
in our sort of orbital
construction procedure.

01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:27.780
But for all the bonds that
we wanted to consider,

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:29.280
this is perfect.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:33.390
And once we sort of feel
confident that this works,

01:17:33.390 --> 01:17:36.511
we can actually use
it to calculate the--

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.860
let me actually go farther--

01:17:41.860 --> 01:17:44.050
we can actually
use it to calculate

01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:47.470
the electronic
structure of systems

01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:52.010
that are too large to attack
directly, something like this.

01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:56.320
This has just a conducting
region of 3,000 atoms

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.870
and a very long sort
of semi-infinite leads

01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:59.680
on the side.

01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:02.455
And we can figure out
a lot of what happens,

01:18:02.455 --> 01:18:05.650
say, to the ballistic
conductivity of this system.

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:08.420
And I'm not really
going into the details.

01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:12.730
I wanted to go before
concluding to a previous slide

01:18:12.730 --> 01:18:17.920
here, in which I was
actually showing how,

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.550
in practice, the matrix
element between a localized

01:18:21.550 --> 01:18:24.280
orbital and another
localized orbital

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.730
changes as a function
of the distance,

01:18:26.730 --> 01:18:30.550
say, as we sit on a
carbon atom, and we

01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:33.550
look at the overlap
between the pz orbital here

01:18:33.550 --> 01:18:36.400
and we move away
from the nanotube.

01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:39.940
And you see, in a
semi-logarithmic scale,

01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:43.000
we have very good
exponential decay.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.760
Certain point goes into
the numerical noise.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.920
And we can really look at--

01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:53.860
validate what are the effects
of our truncation by cutting

01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:58.000
shorter and shorter
Hamiltonians, by neglecting

01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:00.820
a large number of terms
that are far away.

01:19:00.820 --> 01:19:03.775
And you see, there is
almost an invisible effect

01:19:03.775 --> 01:19:05.040
on the band structure.

01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:09.100
So that really sort of tells us
how much localized things are,

01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:11.320
how much they overlap,
and if you want,

01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:15.790
tells us how long range or
short range chemistry is.

01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:18.700
That is very important
when we consider

01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.930
one of this configuration.

01:19:20.930 --> 01:19:22.870
So with this, I'll conclude.

01:19:22.870 --> 01:19:25.570
Again, the two
important messages

01:19:25.570 --> 01:19:28.330
that you want to
remember from this class

01:19:28.330 --> 01:19:31.490
is how you take a
physical problem,

01:19:31.490 --> 01:19:33.970
and you can use density
functional calculation

01:19:33.970 --> 01:19:36.610
to find out what are
the important parameters

01:19:36.610 --> 01:19:39.320
and construct a model
for your energy.

01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:42.400
The first case where
configurational variables

01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:47.890
inducing relaxation and gives
us Ising-like Hamiltonian,

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:50.260
in this case, we have
localized orbitals.

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:54.040
And once we determine those,
from a small calculation

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.900
or from a fragment,
we can actually

01:19:55.900 --> 01:19:58.622
calculate the very large system.

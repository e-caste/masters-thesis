WEBVTT

00:00:05.638 --> 00:00:07.507
So what is Creole?

00:00:07.507 --> 00:00:12.078
And what I'd like to
do is to look at, say,

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:15.882
what happens in the
history of learning French

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:17.283
by adults and by children.

00:00:17.283 --> 00:00:19.119
We saw examples of that before.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.121
But what we find there,
and this is actually

00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:25.892
a very robust fact,
which is that when

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:28.194
you have people
learning French, often--

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:30.163
so in the case of,
say, object pronouns,

00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:33.199
they do produce
structures of that sort.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:35.301
This doesn't have to be
in the Creole environment.

00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:36.870
It happens in
Marseilles, it happens

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.739
in all kinds of
varieties where you

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:41.641
have second-language learning.

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:46.546
So the idea is that often,
as you learn the language,

00:00:46.546 --> 00:00:47.914
you might see a
particular order,

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.849
like subject, verb, object.

00:00:49.849 --> 00:00:52.252
If that order is
the dominant order,

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.554
often you take that
order and you apply it

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:58.024
to all the elements
that might fit it.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:00:58.958
You overgeneralize.

00:00:58.958 --> 00:01:00.193
Children do that all the time.

00:01:00.193 --> 00:01:05.031
When children say things
like, I have one foot

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:07.667
and you have two foots.

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:09.269
Saying "foot" and
"foots" instead

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:10.870
of saying "foot" and "feet."

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.208
It's missing that--
almost every child

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:19.979
will get to do in the
path of learning English.

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.781
Because what do they do?

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.483
They are real scientists.

00:01:23.483 --> 00:01:26.953
They have an hypothesis
about, say, plurals.

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:27.887
S marks the plural.

00:01:27.887 --> 00:01:29.489
So why should you
bother to say "feet"

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.825
is you have a well-behaved
plural like S.

00:01:31.825 --> 00:01:34.894
If you say, I don't know, if
you say "table," "tables."

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:36.930
If you say "pen," "pens."

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.598
Why would you say
"foot," "feet"?

00:01:39.598 --> 00:01:42.602
[INAUDIBLE] And
children do that.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.170
And the same here.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.343
If you know that your language
has verb object order, you say,

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:52.045
frapp** la balle, hit the ball.

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:54.514
Why would you say, when
you have a pronoun,

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:56.716
why would you put
it before the verb?

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.585
It seems to be a
natural hypothesis,

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:02.255
if you're a learner, to assume
that a pronoun like a full noun

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.590
will come after the verb.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.591
And that's what you see.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.060
The contrast is between
standard French,

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:16.936
where you get the pronoun before
the verb, and this is as to if.

00:02:16.936 --> 00:02:19.139
This is a learner's
French, an adult learner's

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:23.409
French, where you get the
pronoun after the verb.

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.613
Not to make a long story
short-- go ahead Nick.

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:27.380
NICK: I don't know.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.151
Maybe it's just off topic.

00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:33.553
If it's the most
natural thing to assume

00:02:33.553 --> 00:02:38.124
that the object
follows the verb,

00:02:38.124 --> 00:02:40.927
how did French ever
develop this weird--

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.630
MICHEL DEGRAFF: That's
a good question.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.065
It means that as you
learn the language

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:49.936
there are other factors
in that learning.

00:02:49.936 --> 00:02:52.071
Although the learning might
have a natural tendency

00:02:52.071 --> 00:02:54.474
to do that, but since,
in the case of French,

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.475
there are norms.

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:58.311
There are books, there is TV.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:02.849
So eventually, the learner will
move towards a different set

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.584
of patterns.

00:03:04.584 --> 00:03:06.686
But then, languages do change.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.689
And in language
change, often there

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.892
is a path towards more general--

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:15.762
Take for example, so Steven
Pinker, a very good linguist

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:17.463
who was at MIT
and at Harvard, he

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:20.400
has a whole book on how the
patterns of regular verbs

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.901
change in English.

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:28.641
Things like go, went
or shine, shown.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:31.177
So many of these over
time become regular.

00:03:31.177 --> 00:03:34.079
So you go from shine,
shown to shine, shined.

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.915
Well, it hasn't happened yet.

00:03:35.915 --> 00:03:38.384
But what he said,
over time there's

00:03:38.384 --> 00:03:40.553
a movement of verbs
going from being

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:42.222
irregular to being regular.

00:03:42.222 --> 00:03:44.123
And one could explain
that because of the fact

00:03:44.123 --> 00:03:47.727
that there's a tendency to
make all these verbs fit

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:52.198
the same pattern,
the regular pattern.

00:03:52.198 --> 00:03:55.435
Whereas in time, there's
also prescriptive norms.

00:03:55.435 --> 00:03:56.970
There is a prestige language.

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.072
There's a linguist
called Tony [? Krock, ?]

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:02.809
who actually argued
that very often, changes

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.044
occur in a different
direction because why?

00:04:05.044 --> 00:04:08.047
Because people use language
to show that they are fancy,

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.048
they are sophisticated.

00:04:09.048 --> 00:04:12.885
So they will use the
irregular pattern to show off.

00:04:12.885 --> 00:04:14.220
It's like the who, whom case.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.723
So how many of you hear
people saying, "whom" in all

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.358
the wrong places, because--

00:04:18.358 --> 00:04:19.826
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:19.826 --> 00:04:21.995
--because whom,
when you say "whom"

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:25.498
or when you say "John and
I," it might sound fancier

00:04:25.498 --> 00:04:26.432
than "John and me."

00:04:26.432 --> 00:04:28.034
But what you find
is that often people

00:04:28.034 --> 00:04:31.104
will say "John and I" or "Mary
and I" in the wrong place.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:35.441
They will say, I just had a
good talk with "Mary and--

00:04:35.441 --> 00:04:39.479
no-- my dad went to
see "Mary and I."

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.481
But "Mary and I" in
that particular context

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:42.615
is not correct.

00:04:42.615 --> 00:04:44.784
It should be "Mary and me"
because it's the object.

00:04:44.784 --> 00:04:47.654
Why would you say "Mary
and I" in object position?

00:04:47.654 --> 00:04:50.957
Maybe because "Mary
and I" sounds sincere

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:52.692
people would tend to use it.

00:04:52.692 --> 00:04:53.593
Or the "whom" thing.

00:04:53.593 --> 00:04:55.061
We saw earlier that
there are cases

00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:58.831
where people say "whom," which
grammatically is not correct.

00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:02.969
But because it sounds fancy, so
"whom" should I say is calling?

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.003
I hear that all the time.

00:05:04.003 --> 00:05:07.373
People say "whom" calls you?

00:05:07.373 --> 00:05:08.641
"Whom" calls you?

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:10.610
It should be "who" called you?

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:11.978
Because, according
to the grammar

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:14.514
of the language in that
particular environment,

00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:15.648
it's a subject.

00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.016
So you don't expect
to get "whom"

00:05:17.016 --> 00:05:20.353
because "whom" is for
"who," technically,

00:05:20.353 --> 00:05:23.423
in terms of grammar,
like "him" is for "he,"

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:25.457
or like "her" is for "she."

00:05:25.457 --> 00:05:28.895
This is basically the
function of the m on whom.

00:05:28.895 --> 00:05:32.699
It makes it an accusative form.

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.735
But yet, people now use "whom"
even when it's a subject.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:36.235
Why?

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.171
Because it sounds fancy.

00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.872
In fact, there's a
linguist that calls it

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.741
a various, a grammar various.

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:43.943
You get infected because
you want to sound fancy.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.740
In fact, we talked
about identity,

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:51.284
that's one place where identity
might play a role in language

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.586
change because by using
those forms you want

00:05:53.586 --> 00:05:56.856
to project yourself
as being superior,

00:05:56.856 --> 00:06:00.026
as being sophisticated.

00:06:00.026 --> 00:06:02.428
And then you would use-- it's
like in Creole, in Haitian

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:06.466
Creole, people use often the
rounded vowels from French

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:07.900
to show that they know French.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.070
They use the rounded vowels,
like "euh" instead of "ee"

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:12.071
where it doesn't belong.

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:14.574
And they produce all kinds
of weird sentences, where

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:17.877
you get all these "euhs" where,
even in French you have "ee."

00:06:17.877 --> 00:06:20.446
Because they perceive
that the "euh"

00:06:20.446 --> 00:06:22.849
is a mockery of
French not Creole.

00:06:22.849 --> 00:06:25.485
And therefore they want to
use it all over the place.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:26.953
And it's called
hyper correction.

00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:28.521
You're hyper
correcting yourself.

00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:33.659
But as you hyper correct
you sound stupid really.

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:35.495
And then there are all
these jokes about it,

00:06:35.495 --> 00:06:37.964
actually, because people
are aware that people

00:06:37.964 --> 00:06:40.433
who use all these "euhs"
is because that we

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.734
know where to use the "ee."

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:45.338
It's a pressure of
society on speaking

00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.340
in a particular way
that actually creates

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.876
all kinds of weird patterns
that eventually can

00:06:49.876 --> 00:06:51.711
become part of the language.

00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:55.715
That's one driving
force in language change

00:06:55.715 --> 00:06:59.118
is this desire to sound
better than you or I.

00:06:59.118 --> 00:07:00.620
It's like people
who vote for Trump.

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:03.089
They might vote for Trump not
because they believe in Trump

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:05.958
but because it might mean
something for their identity.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:11.864
So language has this power
of establishing status.

00:07:11.864 --> 00:07:14.534
STUDENT 5: So when you
struggle with your identity,

00:07:14.534 --> 00:07:15.868
are we prone to grammar viruses?

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:17.303
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.572
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Yeah, yeah.

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:21.174
That's one way to
put it, actually.

00:07:21.174 --> 00:07:22.909
Yeah.

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:24.744
The next part that I
was going to talk about

00:07:24.744 --> 00:07:30.650
had to do with why does
language learning by adults

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:34.887
have this effect on, say,
verb order, on conjugation.

00:07:34.887 --> 00:07:38.357
And the point could
be made very quickly,

00:07:38.357 --> 00:07:42.195
which is that this is
something which is universal.

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:45.965
That we know, in many
contexts of English learning,

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:49.936
that adults do have
this effect [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:49.936 --> 00:07:54.173
If you are going to learn, say,
Italian, or any other languages

00:07:54.173 --> 00:07:57.443
that have lots of markers
on a verb for conjugation,

00:07:57.443 --> 00:08:01.514
often in the first stages of
learning, you don't have these.

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:04.750
You drop these because you're
trying to speak the language.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:06.452
And these are to be memorized.

00:08:06.452 --> 00:08:08.921
And at first, you may not
memorize them properly.

00:08:08.921 --> 00:08:10.690
So it seems that it's
a general phenomenon.

00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.858
And the point here is that--

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:15.990
the key paragraph
here is this one.

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:19.165
That maybe the way to
understand language change,

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:24.904
which in my view,
includes Creole formation,

00:08:24.904 --> 00:08:28.174
is to consider the effects
of both language learning

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.375
by adults and by children.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.210
And if that's the
case, then that's

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:33.880
what is going to drive all
kinds of language change,

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:37.650
not just what you see in the
case of Creole formation.

00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.920
So this is under the
part of the conclusion.

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:48.427
Just to recapitulate
that, basically,

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:50.029
so to those of you
who were asking, So

00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:52.431
what's my theory of
Creole formation?

00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:53.833
I don't need one.

00:08:53.833 --> 00:08:56.135
You see, I don't need one
because Creole formation

00:08:56.135 --> 00:08:57.470
is just language change.

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.973
So whatever linguists understand
about the way languages change,

00:09:00.973 --> 00:09:03.042
to me it applies to
Creole formation.

00:09:03.042 --> 00:09:06.412
I have one paper that
came out earlier this year

00:09:06.412 --> 00:09:12.518
with Enoch Aboh, my colleague
from Benin from West Africa.

00:09:12.518 --> 00:09:16.255
And the paper is called "A
New Theory of [INAUDIBLE]."."

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:18.190
It's new in the
sense that it should

00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:20.526
be the default
theory that Creole

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:22.228
are like other languages.

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:26.098
So therefore, you don't need to
have a special theory for them.

00:09:26.098 --> 00:09:28.100
So it should be, the
new, like what is this?

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.503
That Creoles don't
need a theory.

00:09:30.503 --> 00:09:33.172
Whatever theory applies
to French or English

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:34.373
should apply to Creole.

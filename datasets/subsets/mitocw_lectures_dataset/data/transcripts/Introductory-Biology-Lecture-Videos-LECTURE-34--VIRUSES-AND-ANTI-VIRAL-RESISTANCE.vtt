BARBARA IMPERIALI:
What I'm going

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.390
to do first of all for today,
the bulk of today's lecture

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.600
will be on HIV
and Ebola viruses,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.380
with more time spent on HIV
because it's potentially

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.870
one of the mechanistically best
understood of the retroviruses.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.260
And it also has offered
numerous opportunities

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.390
for therapeutic intervention.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.310
And there are a lot
of themes and terms

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:45.930
that I can bring up as I talk
to you about the HIV virus,

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.250
because it's just a great
exemplar of the viruses.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.750
OK.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.382
So HIV is what is
known as a retrovirus.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.370
So that sort of designates
that there's something working

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.710
backwards in this retrovirus.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.680
Based on its number in the
Baltimore Classification,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.220
it is the most recently
identified mechanism

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.660
of viruses.

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:23.990
HIV stands for Human
Immunodeficiency Virus.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.950
And when you hear
the term HIV, you'll

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:44.370
often hear HIV/AIDS where the
AIDS part stands for Acquired

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.915
Immunodeficiency Syndrome.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.110
So what you can start
to tell about the name--

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.470
why am I hunching down--

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.410
is there's something related to
the immune system with respect

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.950
to this virus.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.360
And in particular, it is
that this virus targets,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.170
very specifically, a
population of the cells that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.540
are critical in immunity.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.510
And when the virus
attacks those cells,

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.100
the person infected with the
virus becomes immunodeficit.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.180
So I've talked to you
about different viruses.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.940
Some go to the liver.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.380
Some go for other organs.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.270
So like the liver,
the viruses that

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.810
really cause a
deficiency in liver

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.410
function, but this one is
very specifically deficiencies

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.030
in immune function.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.560
And it has been a tremendous
challenge developing vaccines

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.670
against HIV/AIDS because of the
problem with the immune system.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.110
The other thing that I mentioned
to you in the last class

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.560
was that HIV is often
found co-infecting

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.400
with TB patients, people with
those microbial infections.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.610
And that's because the
immunodeficiency makes you more

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.170
susceptible to tuberculosis.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.370
And oftentimes
there's a co-infection

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.740
with the two diseases.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.470
And it makes the people
with TB really even

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.050
less able to combat
the TB infection.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.540
So that is really what gets
a lot of the TB patients.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.350
So that's an important
aspect to know.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:38.700
And it's also an
important aspect

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.420
to be aware of when treating
people for any infection

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.420
is if there's an HIV
component, the body

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.260
is much less able to
deal with mounting

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.300
an immune response
because of the fact

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.430
that the immune
cells are targeted.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.155
So HIV is an envelope virus.

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.480
That means it has a
membrane around it.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.000
It is this sort
of peculiar shape

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.920
where the outside of
the membrane is coated--

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.560
the outside of the virus
is coated with membrane.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:27.510
And then stuck in that membrane
are particular proteins

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.450
that are very critical
for interaction

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.650
with the human host cells.

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:40.230
So these are often
termed GP proteins.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.530
And the one very
important one is GP140.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:51.090
And that GP stands
for glycoprotein.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.090
Now, an important aspect,
remember, of virus lifestyle

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.030
is that they
basically exploit all

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.360
of the human cellular
machinery for their benefit

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:07.200
to make their proteins for all
of the basic needs of a cell.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:10.910
So these glycoproteins
look like the glycoproteins

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.190
that are made by
humans, because they're

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.980
being made by the
same machinery that we

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.080
would make the glycoproteins.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.390
In bacteria, when we
talked about them,

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.910
it's a different machinery
that glycoproteins

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.340
and glycoconjugates
look different.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:30.290
But in HIV, the glycoproteins
look like our glycoproteins.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.970
And therefore, you
could more or less

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.950
consider the HIV virus particle
to be coated with things

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.180
that look sort of human.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.800
So that's a kind of
decoy to the human system

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.760
anyway with respect to
recognizing a foreign entity.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:50.390
So often the glycans
there serve as decoys

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:52.520
to make the human body
think, well, there's

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.000
nothing wrong here.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.880
Now within the
virus, there is RNA.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.240
And it's single-stranded
but negative strand RNA,

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.650
so that's what puts it into--

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.150
Sorry.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.460
Positive strand.

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.287
Positive.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.000
So what puts it into
a separate category

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.440
is the fact that the genetic
material in the retroviruses

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.130
is single-stranded RNA and
it's the positive strand.

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:27.740
So far we've talked
about two other types

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.390
of virus mechanisms--

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.340
the double-stranded
DNA-- remember

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.170
that was as an example.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.330
That was smallpox--
and we've also

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:39.290
talked about the single-stranded
RNA negative strand.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.550
And our best example there
was the influenza virus,

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.370
which is a segmented genome.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.820
What you'll learn
about HIV is that it

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:57.575
has a non-segmented genome.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.070
Meaning that this strand
of RNA is one continuous

00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:06.950
strand rather than
separate pieces

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.110
as we saw in the
influenza virus, which

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.380
was the last example at
the end of the last class.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.300
Now, let me just
take a quick look.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:21.160
So every virion, that would
be a single viral particle,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.870
therefore will contain
within its structure the RNA.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:33.980
And it will also contain two
copies of a particular enzyme

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:35.930
that are absolutely critical.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.210
When the virus infects
a cell, there's

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:39.920
no time for it to make anything.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.650
It needs a particular
enzyme to get

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:47.960
going with replicating
that initial strand of RNA

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.340
to start to come to make a DNA,
double-stranded DNA copy of it,

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.630
and then make a messenger RNA.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:56.600
So the enzyme that's
important and there

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:05.190
are two copies of an enzyme
known as reverse transcriptase.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.210
So basically, the virus
structure is fairly simple.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:20.790
There's a capsid
inside with the RNA

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:24.050
plus the reverse transcriptase
that I'm just showing

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.240
as a filled circle here.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:32.240
And then surrounding the
virion is a membrane bilayer

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:36.943
with GP proteins stuck into
that membrane bilayer that

00:08:36.943 --> 00:08:38.360
are going to be
important when one

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.590
starts to think about the
infectivity by the virus.

00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.250
All right.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:48.720
There's a second glycoprotein
that's also important,

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.930
which is known as GP41.

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:55.870
And these are very specifically
part of this complex,

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:58.990
but associated with the GP140.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:08:59.730
All right.

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:02.930
So now let's take a
look at the virus life--

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:06.660
or details of this virus.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.710
But first of all, I want you
to take a look at T-cells.

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:13.030
You've heard a
lot about T-cells.

00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:16.210
They're a major component
of the immune system.

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:18.780
So I'm going to home
you right in on what

00:09:18.780 --> 00:09:22.980
the virus, the virion,
recognizes on T-cells

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.810
and what makes it
such a disaster

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:26.680
for the human immune system.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.180
OK.

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.570
So here are typical
T-cell receptors

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.670
on the surface of T-cells.

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:36.200
Just as a recap, I want you
to remember T-cells produce

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.560
unique antigen binding
proteins that are

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.740
put onto the T-cell surface.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:46.770
And they provide
cell-mediated immunity

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.700
by destroying antigens
such as viruses.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.790
But what the HIV virus
does is it really

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:58.320
homes in on the cell-surface
receptors of the T-cells,

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:05.890
specifically the HIV virus
recognizes the CD4 receptor,

00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:09.600
which is a glycoprotein on
the surface of some T-cells

00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.720
that are designated as
CD4 positive T-cells.

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.070
So if you have
circulating T-cells,

00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:22.830
that would be the first place
where the HIV virus attaches

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:26.130
to the T-cell to
cause infectivity,

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:30.060
thus debilitating
the ability to mount

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:33.720
the type of immune responses
that T-cells are involved in.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:36.420
So it's very important
to now understand

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.910
why the physiology of
this virus is to knock out

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:44.280
the thing that's
there to protect us

00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.700
from foreign antigens,
which makes it so serious.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:54.540
Now, HIV first started to
emerge in the early '80s.

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.660
It was more or less designated
as a death sentence.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.630
As you may be aware,
HIV circulated

00:11:00.630 --> 00:11:04.260
around the gay community
in the San Francisco area

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:05.590
very rapidly.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:09.880
But it then became
incredibly widespread.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:11.700
There's a possibility
that the jump

00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:17.670
of the virus from primates
to humans, the virus

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.920
might have originated in Africa.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.340
There's a lot of work done
on the origin of this virus,

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.580
but it sort of came
out of nowhere.

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.100
It was something that was
unexpected, unanticipated,

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.790
and hitting people
just like a cannonball.

00:11:32.790 --> 00:11:36.690
And it was literally a
death sentence early on.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.710
As the mechanism of the
virus became understood,

00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.010
a number of strategies could
be put in place with respect

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:48.810
to antiviral therapeutics to
target this particular virus.

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.910
And what we will see
is the four types

00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:55.050
of targets that have
been named as targets

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.540
for therapeutic agents, why
they work, how they work.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.170
And we'll see the mechanisms
of those as to how

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.680
they pertain to the HIV virus.

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.620
And we'll talk about things
like combination therapies.

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.770
So early on, there
was really nothing.

00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:15.310
Gradually early, therapeutic
approaches started to emerge,

00:12:15.310 --> 00:12:18.300
but they were
devastating treatments

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.380
because the drugs were so
poor against the HIV virus,

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:26.460
people were taking massive
handfuls of medications a day

00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.860
to try to stay
ahead of the virus.

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:32.370
As time has progressed,
these therapeutic agents

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.410
have been improved and improved.

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.370
And now they're relatively
simple therapeutic agents

00:12:38.370 --> 00:12:41.460
where you don't have to
take massive doses of fairly

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:44.040
non-specific therapeutic agents.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:48.210
But they're quite
sort of workable.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:50.880
The problem is,
and you'll see why,

00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.300
people have to take these
therapeutic agents for life.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.970
Once cells are
infected with HIV,

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.640
there will always
be a population

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:03.760
of the virus genetic
material in the human genome.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.330
So you can't just say,
I feel way better,

00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:09.930
not taking these drugs anymore,
because there is the chance

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:13.170
that in some repository
in some of your cells

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:15.330
the virus genetic
material is still there.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:19.620
And you'll see which enzymes in
HIV are responsible for that.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.790
OK?

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.930
So let's take a look
here at the Group VI

00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:29.160
retrovirus named HIV/AIDS.

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:36.120
In 2015, there were 37
million people infected.

00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.580
Nowhere near enough in
treatment, about half

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:39.900
of those in treatment.

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.760
And about 1.2 million deaths.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.260
This may account also for
people coinfected with TB.

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:48.390
I mentioned to you
when we started

00:13:48.390 --> 00:13:50.820
talking about
infectious disease,

00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.750
I really encourage you to
go to the NIAID website.

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:58.110
There is tons of really
interesting information,

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:00.330
not just from a
clinical perspective

00:14:00.330 --> 00:14:02.430
but from a mechanistic
perspective,

00:14:02.430 --> 00:14:03.670
from a treatment perspective.

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:05.370
There's really important things.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:07.230
So I really encourage
you if you are

00:14:07.230 --> 00:14:10.980
interested in infectious
disease, the National

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:17.400
Institute of Allergies and
Infectious Diseases Component

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.490
of the NIH is the one
responsible for all

00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.860
the research on
infectious disease.

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:26.250
And in fact, for
many, many years

00:14:26.250 --> 00:14:28.620
during the crisis
with HIV, there

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:32.970
were special earmarked
funds for any research

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:35.880
towards the development
of therapeutic agents.

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.260
So what happens?

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:39.210
How does this virus,
this little particle

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.310
that I've shown you here--

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:44.810
I should really show
you this is the capsid.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.000
And I should really show you
the membrane a little bit more

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.490
encircling that with
the capsid inside.

00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:55.020
So the cartoon that you see
on the screen is more correct.

00:14:55.020 --> 00:14:57.450
So here's the virion particle.

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.470
It has inside it the
capsid that includes

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:03.690
the single-stranded RNA.

00:15:03.690 --> 00:15:06.730
It only needs to code
for very few proteins,

00:15:06.730 --> 00:15:09.720
remember, because the virus
just exploits everything

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.550
else from the human host.

00:15:11.550 --> 00:15:22.090
And GP120-- sorry for that
typo, please correct that.

00:15:22.090 --> 00:15:26.980
And GP120 is displayed on
the surface of the virion.

00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:30.310
And in fact, it's
GP120 that interacts

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.270
with the CD4 receptor on
the surface of a target host

00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:36.160
cell, a T-cell.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:39.860
Now there is a second receptor
that's quite important.

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.640
It was not discovered
until quite a bit later on.

00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.330
It's designated
as the coreceptor.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.650
And the interaction of the
virion with the host cell

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.340
is only good when there's
both the CD4 receptor

00:15:54.340 --> 00:15:56.230
plus the coreceptor.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.900
And this was found through
careful biology that

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.750
realized there was
another critical component

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:03.530
for the infectious disease.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:08.200
And that is designated as
the CCR5 receptor or CXCR4

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.070
receptor.

00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.330
So both receptors on
the surface, the virus

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:16.600
has evolved or selected
out, to recognize

00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.300
cells that have both of
those types of receptors

00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.380
on the surface which ends
up making them very targeted

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.150
towards the T-cells.

00:16:25.150 --> 00:16:28.840
Once that association
occurs, then

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.260
becomes the process of fusion.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:36.970
So remember, I told you that
large things can get into cells

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:41.440
by merging a membrane
with the membrane

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:43.280
on the surface of the cell.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.990
So what is happening as those
two receptors are engaged

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:53.110
is the virus membrane is coming
close to the host cell membrane

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:58.180
and starting to fuse
through the action of GP120

00:16:58.180 --> 00:17:02.117
along with the CD4
receptor and coreceptor.

00:17:02.117 --> 00:17:03.700
And I'm going to
show you a movie that

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.490
shows that part of the
fusion, because it's really

00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:08.619
cool to see it in action.

00:17:08.619 --> 00:17:13.119
Once that fusion occurs,
the virus membrane

00:17:13.119 --> 00:17:16.750
actually just merges with the
remainder of the host cell

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.589
membrane.

00:17:17.589 --> 00:17:21.190
And you drop that capsid into
the cell, which then becomes

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:25.690
on packaged to release the
single-stranded RNA that's

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.310
the contents of that.

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:31.910
And what's important to know--
whoops going backwards--

00:17:31.910 --> 00:17:35.570
is that the minute the
single-stranded RNA

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:43.570
gets into the cell, that
needs to be processed.

00:17:43.570 --> 00:17:47.080
But it needs to be processed
with an enzyme that is

00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.550
completely unique to the virus.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.480
And that's the
reverse transcriptase.

00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.020
Without the reverse
transcriptase being there,

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.420
it's just RNA that's just going
to get chewed up in the cell.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:04.840
So what reverse transcriptase
does it reverse transcribes RNA

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.550
into DNA.

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:10.360
So that gets you on the track
to the infectious process.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.150
In the absence of RT,
you don't get there.

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:17.260
You're not able to make
a DNA copy to then make

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:19.240
a copy of the RNA and so on.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.460
So reverse
transcriptase, that is

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.200
why the reverse transcriptase
has to be delivered along

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.110
with the virus.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:30.020
It can't be just a virus
with the genetic material.

00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.650
It's got to have this
particular enzyme with it.

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:38.650
So reverse transcriptase is
responsible for converting RNA

00:18:38.650 --> 00:18:40.060
into DNA.

00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:44.740
And as you all know, that
is not the usual direction

00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:46.480
with respect to
the central dogma.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.330
We're always talking
about DNA to RNA.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:51.790
But you've also heard
throughout the course,

00:18:51.790 --> 00:18:56.440
how handy this reverse
transcriptase is material is.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.550
When we talk about arrays
and loads of biotechnology,

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:03.540
using reverse transcriptase
is super valuable.

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:07.180
Let's say, for example, we
don't want to sequence a genome,

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.060
we want to look at the
transcriptome, the part

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.030
of the genome that's really
important for being translated

00:19:13.030 --> 00:19:14.440
into proteins.

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.380
What we do is we collect
the transcriptome

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:20.260
but reverse transcribe
it into DNA,

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.860
which is a much more
stable, tractable material

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:26.330
for sequencing and
so on and so forth.

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:29.950
So RT has become kind of
a gift to biotechnology

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:31.570
and biological research.

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:35.860
And it was inspired from
the RT in the HIV virus.

00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:37.820
So that's very important.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.180
So the reverse
transcriptase, then,

00:19:40.180 --> 00:19:44.350
makes a DNA copy of the RNA.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:47.320
And then a second
complementary copy

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.760
of that DNA is made to make
double-stranded DNA which

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.940
represents the viral
genome, but in the format

00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:57.070
of a double-stranded DNA.

00:19:57.070 --> 00:20:01.600
That DNA can be, then, taken--

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.160
here's the fun part.

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:07.660
That DNA is actually, then,
taken into the nucleus

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.710
and it's zippered in
to the host genome

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:14.290
by an enzyme known as integrase.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:17.110
So it's not that you
have this virus junk

00:20:17.110 --> 00:20:19.300
and then you send
it back out again

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.670
with the mature
particles, you actually

00:20:21.670 --> 00:20:27.580
put this in the permanent copy
of your DNA in the nucleus.

00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:33.820
And that is why people don't
get cured from HIV/AIDS.

00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:36.400
They have to take treatment
for the rest of their life,

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.630
because that DNA is permanently
in the copy of your genome

00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:44.290
that gets replicated every time
your cells divide and so on.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:47.920
So you can understand the
seriousness of that event.

00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:52.120
So that gets taken
into the genome.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.080
But also when it's time
to make new virions,

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:00.520
the DNA is transcribed
into messenger RNA.

00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.820
The messenger RNA
leaves the nucleus,

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:06.790
gets translated into proteins.

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.070
And those proteins
form the basis

00:21:09.070 --> 00:21:11.290
of the new virion particles.

00:21:11.290 --> 00:21:14.200
Now, I mentioned
somewhere here that it

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:16.780
is a non-segmented genome.

00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:24.840
So initially, the messenger
RNA is a single segment

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:30.640
that then gets translated into
a single segment of protein,

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.300
which is known as a polyprotein.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:40.060
So there are no stops between
the various genes encoding

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.740
frames within the messenger RNA.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:46.810
So that gets transcribed
by the host machinery

00:21:46.810 --> 00:21:51.670
straight into a polyprotein
that's all glued together

00:21:51.670 --> 00:21:53.660
in a single long piece.

00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:59.990
But then there is another
important HIV enzyme,

00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:06.760
the protease, that chops those
portions of the polyprotein

00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:10.300
up into useful and
usable portions.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:14.020
So you also need the
protease readily available

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.910
rapidly to start dicing up the
polyprotein into usable protein

00:22:18.910 --> 00:22:21.550
segments for the
new virus assembly.

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:24.970
So let's take a look
here what happens.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:26.545
The messenger
leaves the nucleus.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.970
You make a polyprotein that gets
digested into protein segments.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:37.870
And then everything accumulates
at the inside surface

00:22:37.870 --> 00:22:42.340
of the membrane and starts
budding off the virion.

00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.560
When it's first budded off,
it's not really ready to go.

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.630
It's not intact.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:49.150
It has to develop a
little bit further

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.210
to become a mature
virion moving forward

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.340
to go infect another cell.

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:59.530
So the initial stage, that
budded stage, of the virion

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:02.290
is not completely
competent to go infect.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:04.810
And in fact, there
has been some thoughts

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:10.180
about can you ensure that the
immature virion doesn't develop

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.760
into the mature virion,
because that would be one

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.480
way of targeting the system.

00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:14.980
OK.

00:23:14.980 --> 00:23:18.010
So there are a few
different pieces--

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:28.830
the reverse transcriptase,
the integrase, the protease,

00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:29.625
and then, finally--

00:23:32.610 --> 00:23:35.160
these are all critical
processes that

00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.290
have been the targets
of therapeutic agents.

00:23:38.290 --> 00:23:40.950
They are molecular
targets, such as enzymes.

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:47.010
And we know how to address
enzymes with inhibitors.

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:51.240
And one last feature
of the virus life cycle

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:55.500
that has been focused on
respect to therapeutics

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.565
is the viral fusion.

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:06.090
So there have also been
efforts at a molecular level

00:24:06.090 --> 00:24:12.810
to try to inhibit this process
where your virus particle docks

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:17.010
down on the cell and
somehow the membranes fuse

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:20.460
and then the virus dumps
its contents into the cell.

00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:21.240
OK.

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:26.130
This is just sort of a quick
sort of more beautiful view.

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:28.770
But in a minute, I'm
going to show you a video.

00:24:28.770 --> 00:24:31.080
But I thought it was kind
of nice because it really

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.570
allows you to look at the
different steps in the virus

00:24:34.570 --> 00:24:36.660
life cycle--

00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:42.360
recognition, fusion, delivery,
making the double-stranded DNA,

00:24:42.360 --> 00:24:45.120
integrated the DNA
into the genome,

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.920
and making new viral proteins.

00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.170
So those steps,
they're pretty logical.

00:24:49.170 --> 00:24:52.320
It's just like step one,
got to find my target.

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.420
Step two, I've got to
stick to my target.

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.990
Step three, I've got to
deliver my genomic content

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:00.030
into my target and so on.

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.040
So I don't want you
to think this is

00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.570
a bunch of steps to memorize.

00:25:03.570 --> 00:25:07.170
They all sort of make sense in
a logical progression of events

00:25:07.170 --> 00:25:11.250
to make the virus be able to go
all the way through to budding

00:25:11.250 --> 00:25:15.780
off new, immature, and
then mature virions.

00:25:15.780 --> 00:25:17.710
And so as I
mentioned over there,

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:19.230
these are the four
targets that I'm

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:20.970
going to describe
to you with respect

00:25:20.970 --> 00:25:23.040
to therapeutic development.

00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:24.780
And this is where
they all work--

00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.980
the fusion early on, the
reverse transcriptase

00:25:28.980 --> 00:25:34.830
taking that single-stranded
RNA to a DNA copy,

00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:38.340
the integrase which zips
the genomic material

00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:42.480
into the genome, and the
protease that cleaves up

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:47.400
the long polyprotein to make
mature pieces of protein that

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.375
are part of the virus.

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.590
OK.

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:56.230
So let's talk first of
all about viral fusion.

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:58.660
And as I mentioned, when
I get to showing you--

00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.550
it's a really beautiful
video from the Howard Hughes

00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:06.730
Institute that really
shows the fusion very well.

00:26:06.730 --> 00:26:09.580
But I want to describe
the fusion to you

00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.080
at a molecular level.

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:15.860
And then later, you'll see it
a little bit more real life.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:20.860
So what I said to you is
that GP120 and GP41, which

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:25.870
are these proteins that are
in the surface of the envelope

00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:32.560
then recognize the coreceptor
and CD41 and form a complex.

00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.840
So it's a complex that
involves what's on the virus.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:38.080
It's actually in a
trimeric structure

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:41.050
with the two receptors
that are on the host cell.

00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.690
And they form a
pretty close union.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:45.370
And then what
happens is there are

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:49.900
a series of events that tug
the two membranes together,

00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.380
mechanically linked to
conformational changes

00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:57.520
of the protein, and basically
splosh the two membranes

00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:59.620
together for a fusion event.

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:03.430
So it's through the
confirmational dynamics

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:06.460
of that large complex
happening in sequence

00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:10.930
after the first interactions
that get you to a fusion event.

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:13.600
So these initially
look like this,

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.240
but then they start
changing their shape,

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:18.130
and making a fusion event.

00:27:18.130 --> 00:27:20.590
So you could look at
it as, initially, you

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:23.920
have the complex formed,
but then, later on, there's

00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.780
been a twisting
of the structures,

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:27.580
the large macromolecular
structures

00:27:27.580 --> 00:27:29.420
to fuse the membranes.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.720
So for quite a few years--

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.360
and I don't think it
was the most successful

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.210
of the approaches with
respect to therapeutics--

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:41.440
people thought that maybe you
could inhibit the interaction

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:44.320
between GP120 and
those receptors

00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:47.800
with small molecules that
might inhibit the progress

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:49.930
through the fusion process.

00:27:49.930 --> 00:27:52.780
So that was deemed
a viable target.

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:55.300
It's not the same
as an enzyme target,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:59.110
but it's definitely a critical
point in viral infections.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.930
And what was made
were short peptides

00:28:01.930 --> 00:28:04.690
that might stabilize
this complex

00:28:04.690 --> 00:28:09.040
and avoid the structure
moving forward

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.590
to the fusion-related complex.

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:14.230
So that was one sort
of series of events.

00:28:14.230 --> 00:28:18.070
So those peptides were
designated a C-peptide.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:20.740
They would bind to
this portion up here

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.140
that's pointed to with
the N. They'd stick

00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:25.540
and they'd basically
jam the cogs.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.770
They'd stopped that event
occurring by binding

00:28:29.770 --> 00:28:32.485
quite tightly to part
of the fusion complex.

00:28:32.485 --> 00:28:34.750
OK?

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:38.230
The drugs, the therapeutic
agents, in that case

00:28:38.230 --> 00:28:40.900
were peptidic, kind of large.

00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:44.110
They don't diffuse into cells,
but that's not a problem

00:28:44.110 --> 00:28:46.970
because this target
is outside the cell.

00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:50.470
So there's no need for that to
get into cells for its effect.

00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:53.810
All of the other therapeutic
agents I'll describe to you

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:56.740
are molecules that need
to get into cells in order

00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.610
to do their job.

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.960
But this particular strategy
didn't involve that.

00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:05.350
Which was why it was
fairly attractive early on,

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:08.620
because it was a very different
target from the others.

00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:11.980
So the next step I
want to describe to you

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:17.200
is inhibition of
reserve transcriptase.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:29.690
So this is a RNA-dependent
DNA polymerase.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:30.190
OK?

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:33.280
So different from the
other DNA polymerases.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.800
We have DNA-dependent
DNA polymerases,

00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.190
but we don't have the
RNA-dependent ones.

00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.970
And so the types of strategies
that were used initially

00:29:42.970 --> 00:29:47.380
was to use types of
analogs of the nucleosides

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.500
that will be used
in polymerization.

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:56.660
So the reverse transcriptase,
the first types of targets--

00:29:56.660 --> 00:30:00.490
what's going on down there--
the first types of targets

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:03.920
were nucleoside
analogs because they

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.040
can inhibit the polymerization.

00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:08.540
And you're going to realize you
know quite a bit about these

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.323
when we first look
at the structure.

00:30:10.323 --> 00:30:11.990
So I'm going to
describe to you what are

00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:16.130
known as nucleoside analogs.

00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:22.730
What does this term mean?

00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:27.200
Nucleoside means it's a
nuclear base plus a sugar.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.430
There's no phosphates.

00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:30.970
Because, remember,
there's an s there.

00:30:30.970 --> 00:30:34.670
And it's an analog meaning it's
not one of the native ones,

00:30:34.670 --> 00:30:36.655
but it--

00:30:36.655 --> 00:30:38.166
that looks good.

00:30:38.166 --> 00:30:43.753
AUDIENCE: I'm looking
for [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:43.753 --> 00:30:44.670
BARBARA IMPERIALI: OK.

00:30:44.670 --> 00:30:45.360
I'll grab her.

00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:46.320
And you get the bag.

00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.590
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:49.590 --> 00:30:50.090
OK.

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:52.350
So it's a nucleoside
analog meaning

00:30:52.350 --> 00:30:55.560
it isn't the
standard nucleosides

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:57.540
that you put into your DNA.

00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:02.970
And the most critical first line
actually became azidothymidine.

00:31:02.970 --> 00:31:07.350
So look, that's the thymide
nuclear base, hits a sugar,

00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:10.290
but it's different from
the regular ribose that's

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.350
either in RNA or DNA.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:17.370
And it's two deoxys so it looks
more like a DNA building block.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.270
But check it out.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.683
On the three prime
site, there is azide.

00:31:21.683 --> 00:31:23.100
What do you think
this thing does?

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.310
Or have I already told you?

00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.810
Yeah.

00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:26.185
What do you think
this thing does

00:31:26.185 --> 00:31:29.850
to stop the virus marching
forward and turning

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:31.860
its RNA into a DNA copy?

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.440
Can it polymerase?

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.050
No.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.160
So what do you think?

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.520
So what how does it work?

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:41.890
AUDIENCE: It blocks [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:43.100
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yeah.

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:43.600
Yeah.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:46.960
It just grinds to a
halt. What technology

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:50.420
does this remind you of?

00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:50.995
Yeah?

00:31:50.995 --> 00:31:55.285
AUDIENCE: The sequencing
with the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:31:55.285 --> 00:31:56.910
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
So it's really cool.

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:59.240
I mean, we're using
something like this

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:02.630
for sequencing blocking the
chain growth to get pieces

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:04.670
so we can tell the
sequence, but this

00:32:04.670 --> 00:32:08.820
is a very viable drug for
reverse transcriptase for kind

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:13.310
of similar reasons, because
it stops translation.

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.765
It stops polymerization.

00:32:15.765 --> 00:32:17.390
Now, there's one
important thing that I

00:32:17.390 --> 00:32:24.530
need to tell you about this AZT,
as it's termed, azidothymidine.

00:32:24.530 --> 00:32:33.845
AZT is what is known in
the industry as a prodrug.

00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:41.790
It's not the actual drug.

00:32:41.790 --> 00:32:42.870
Why is it a prodrug?

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.760
What has to happen
to it to be useful?

00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:47.820
Why is it handy
to have a prodrug?

00:32:47.820 --> 00:32:49.630
I know there's a lot
of questions there,

00:32:49.630 --> 00:32:51.460
but they all kind
of tie together.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.340
So it's a prodrug.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:55.800
It can get into cells, right?

00:32:55.800 --> 00:33:00.120
What has to happen to it for
it to be useful in inhibiting

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:03.130
reverse transcriptase?

00:33:03.130 --> 00:33:04.720
Because it won't do
it all on its own.

00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:05.860
Look at that structure.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:09.760
There's something missing
in that structure.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:15.120
What are the building
blocks in the polymerases?

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:18.050
Are they nucleosides?

00:33:18.050 --> 00:33:19.830
No.

00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:21.070
Up there.

00:33:21.070 --> 00:33:23.220
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.870
BARBARA IMPERIALI: Yes, exactly.

00:33:24.870 --> 00:33:27.780
So you have to convert
this neutral molecule that

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:32.760
can sneak into a cell by kinases
that put phosphate groups

00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.740
onto that molecule.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.670
So that that molecule can get
engaged in polymerization,

00:33:38.670 --> 00:33:42.060
you can put one nucleotide
onto a growing strand,

00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.750
but then it can't go any further
because of that azido group

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:49.020
at 3, which would be the
normal place you grow.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.480
So prodrug strategies
are very useful.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:55.620
It's a way of having drugs
that aren't quite drugs yet

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:59.430
but they become drugs once
they are at their location.

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:04.620
It's not handy to use the
triphosphate of AZT as a drug,

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:06.400
because it can't
get in the cell.

00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.900
So we deliver a cellulary
available molecule.

00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:12.929
We let the promiscuous
enzymes in the cell

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.000
convert it to a triphosphate.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:17.980
And then it becomes a
real drug, a mature drug.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:19.800
So I think that's a
very important thing

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.870
about these types of
therapeutic agents.

00:34:23.870 --> 00:34:27.150
And what I want you to know
is that many, many viruses

00:34:27.150 --> 00:34:31.290
are treated with nucleoside
analogs performing

00:34:31.290 --> 00:34:33.150
similar sorts of things.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.560
But in some cases, there's a lot
of different tailoring goes on

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.480
with the nucleoside analog.

00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:45.360
It doesn't always work to
have the azide at C3 prime.

00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.230
Some of these features
don't always work.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:50.250
So these have to be
tailored in different ways

00:34:50.250 --> 00:34:52.530
to target different viruses.

00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:56.210
Because in this case, AZT
hits reverse transcriptase.

00:34:56.210 --> 00:35:01.200
But there may be a different
flavor of polymerase enzyme

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.850
that you need to inhibit
in other organisms.

00:35:03.850 --> 00:35:05.820
So it's a lot, lot,
lot of options.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:06.920
Yeah.

00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.820
AUDIENCE: Does it
only affect RT?

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.670
Or could there be side
effects of the cell,

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:15.097
like an old using
it by accident?

00:35:15.097 --> 00:35:16.680
BARBARA IMPERIALI:
There can be, but I

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:23.290
think the most important thing
is that RT is very promiscuous.

00:35:23.290 --> 00:35:27.280
So it's much more likely to
pop this building block in.

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.460
And that doesn't
have the mechanisms

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:33.270
to reverse that reaction, all
of the clean up that gets done

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.320
with normal DNA polymerase.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.970
So our DNA polymerase is
going to be a lot more tuned

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:41.110
up to avoid these mistakes.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:43.320
But the viral
reverse transcriptase

00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.820
just churn through in making it.

00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:50.700
So we're protected by our own
proofreading and other types

00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:55.980
of mechanisms to avoid it
really messing up replication.

00:35:55.980 --> 00:35:58.380
But that's a very good point.

00:35:58.380 --> 00:35:59.030
OK.

00:35:59.030 --> 00:36:01.710
So remember the central dogma.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:05.520
And this is why this
process confounds that.

00:36:05.520 --> 00:36:06.930
And that's azidothymidine.

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:10.960
And we've already
discussed that.

00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:17.890
So the next enzyme that became
quite an important target,

00:36:17.890 --> 00:36:21.790
because it was a new
target, was integrase.

00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:25.180
So I will tell you, though,
that reverse transcriptase

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:29.200
inhibitors like AZT
were used early on,

00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.990
but people with the virus
rapidly developed resistance

00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:37.720
to that therapeutic agent.

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:41.170
It was one enzyme that was
just mutating like crazy.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:44.710
And the organism could
slip through that net.

00:36:44.710 --> 00:36:48.040
So the development
of therapeutic agents

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.080
didn't stop with AZT.

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.200
It was, like, we need to
hit other targets for us

00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.550
to have a therapeutically
viable combination of therapies

00:36:57.550 --> 00:37:00.740
that can really stop
this virus effectively.

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:05.470
So a next enzyme that was
targeted is integrase.

00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:08.590
So this is the one that's
been targeted most recently.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:13.390
And there are currently
several integrase inhibitors.

00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:15.820
Integrase is a
fascinating enzyme

00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:21.370
because it really is the
enzyme that actually stitches

00:37:21.370 --> 00:37:28.370
that piece of viral DNA
right into the human genome

00:37:28.370 --> 00:37:32.560
just so it's able to be
replicated, transcribed,

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:34.750
and translated at any time.

00:37:34.750 --> 00:37:37.340
So integrase has been targeted.

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:39.370
It was a tricky target to hit.

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:43.210
But as you can see with
several of these drugs,

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:45.970
they are successful drugs.

00:37:45.970 --> 00:37:47.890
One thing I want to
remind you about,

00:37:47.890 --> 00:37:53.000
a lot of the names
of the agents,

00:37:53.000 --> 00:38:00.850
if you see A-V-I-R within the
name of a therapeutic agent,

00:38:00.850 --> 00:38:02.460
it means it's an antiviral.

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.590
So that's a clue that
all of these compounds

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:07.630
are given names--

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.730
raltegravir, blah.

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:12.640
I don't know who comes up with
these names, but nevertheless,

00:38:12.640 --> 00:38:15.730
they're all names
that end in A-V-I-R.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:19.450
So if you see a medicine
and it ends in A-V-I-R,

00:38:19.450 --> 00:38:21.850
it's an antiviral agent.

00:38:21.850 --> 00:38:24.790
Now, the last of the
really fascinating enzymes

00:38:24.790 --> 00:38:28.870
that was targeted
is the HIV protease,

00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:31.420
because the HIV protease
is very, very different

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:34.760
from many proteases
in mammalian biology.

00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.130
It's a simple dimeric structure.

00:38:39.130 --> 00:38:41.110
So it has quaternary structure.

00:38:41.110 --> 00:38:47.140
It has two monomers that
are 99 amino acids each.

00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:52.810
And each monomer
contributes an aspartic acid

00:38:52.810 --> 00:38:54.190
to an active site.

00:38:54.190 --> 00:38:56.380
And those are involved
in the mechanism.

00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:00.130
And what generally happens when
substrates or inhibitors bind

00:39:00.130 --> 00:39:01.990
is these two flaps--

00:39:01.990 --> 00:39:04.030
one of them I've
shown you in magenta--

00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:07.810
close down and close
up the active site.

00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.320
And ritonavir was one of the
first generation protease

00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.880
inhibitors that sat
in the place where

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.270
the substrate would normally
sit in the HIV protease.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.190
And remember that
the HIV protease

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:24.070
is critical for
maturity of the virus

00:39:24.070 --> 00:39:27.040
because it chops
up the polyprotein

00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:29.080
into the necessary enzymes.

00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.200
They can't be functional
enzymes in the polyprotein.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:36.130
They have to cut up into
the appropriate pieces.

00:39:36.130 --> 00:39:39.400
So the HIV protease had
unusual specificity.

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.760
And as soon as it was discovered
and structurally characterized,

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:46.420
every major pharmaceutical
company jumped on-- this was

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:47.830
in the late '80s--

00:39:47.830 --> 00:39:50.890
to make successful
protease inhibitors that

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:52.750
just got better and better.

00:39:52.750 --> 00:39:55.730
Ritonavir is an example
of first generation,

00:39:55.730 --> 00:39:59.140
but I think now we're on third
generation-type inhibitors

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:01.900
which are just a better
and better and much

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:05.820
more selective and specific
for the HIV protease.

00:40:05.820 --> 00:40:08.110
And because they're
much more potent,

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:11.650
instead of needing grams
and grams of an inhibitor,

00:40:11.650 --> 00:40:14.290
you can get away with
milligrams of inhibitor,

00:40:14.290 --> 00:40:19.000
which made the therapeutic
dosing for HIV much more

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.220
palatable is sort
of a good word.

00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:25.180
Because when you have a very
promiscuous protease inhibitor,

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:27.650
like the early ones
that were discovered,

00:40:27.650 --> 00:40:30.700
they mess up your entire
GI because your GI

00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:33.340
runs on proteases
that digest your food.

00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:36.250
So the original, the
early protease inhibitors

00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:37.990
had a lot of side effects.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:41.620
The most modern third
generation are very viable.

00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:43.900
And this just shows
you what other topic I

00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:49.470
want to hit on next is here's
the green and cyan two monomer

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.030
units of HIV protease.

00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:55.390
In yellow is an
inhibitor that is bound.

00:40:55.390 --> 00:40:58.520
And just on one monomer
of the two monomers,

00:40:58.520 --> 00:41:02.200
I've highlighted, in red,
different resistance sites.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.470
So when any of
those sites mutates,

00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:11.120
the protease stops being
inhibited by the HIV protease

00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.210
inhibitors.

00:41:12.210 --> 00:41:14.030
Because you want
to think about it,

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:16.730
one mutation in one
subunit, actually,

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:21.440
will have a corresponding
mutation in the partner subunit

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:22.700
that is in the dimer.

00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:26.030
So each mutation ends
up being two mutations

00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:31.160
in the full enzyme that
has quaternary restructure.

00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:33.740
So these are major.

00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:38.550
They go all the way out to
the outer parts of the enzyme.

00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:40.220
It's not just around
the active site.

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:45.290
It's just all over the enzyme
you can get mutations that

00:41:45.290 --> 00:41:49.010
stop the typical drugs that
are targeted at the protease's

00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:50.030
binding

00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:51.980
So here I just
show you these are

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.740
data that show for
the protease and

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:56.690
for the reverse transcriptase.

00:41:56.690 --> 00:41:58.550
Within the length
of the protease,

00:41:58.550 --> 00:42:02.230
for example, there's
mutations all the way along.

00:42:02.230 --> 00:42:03.440
I don't know why this is 101.

00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:06.740
The numbering system is a little
different in some variants.

00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:11.660
But you can see which mutations
will add to drug resistance.

00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:15.420
And there's a similar picture
here for reverse transcriptase.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:16.040
OK?

00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:19.590
So this is a very serious issue.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.663
So now I'm going to give
you a little break here.

00:42:22.663 --> 00:42:23.330
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.530
- So this is HIV.

00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:26.540
It's a typical
retrovirus, meaning

00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:28.580
that it has an outer envelope.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.370
And in the center, it
has two copies of RNA,

00:42:31.370 --> 00:42:33.770
as well as an
enzyme here in blue

00:42:33.770 --> 00:42:36.800
that's reverse transcriptase,
which will ultimately

00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.140
turn that RNA into DNA.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.130
The virus itself, with
this outer envelope

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:49.490
PROTEIN actually directly
infects T-helper cells.

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:53.330
The way that it does this is
that as it comes up to the cell

00:42:53.330 --> 00:42:57.500
surface, it uses receptors
that are on T-helper cells

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:02.270
and exclusive to T-helper cells,
which are CD4 molecule which

00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:04.100
really defines T-helper cells.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:08.450
It's a surface receptor that
binds to the envelope protein.

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:11.120
That causes a
conformational change

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:14.610
and allows a second receptor
to grab hold of the envelope.

00:43:14.610 --> 00:43:16.550
This is the
chemokine coreceptor.

00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:18.320
It's also called CCR5.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.270
And we'll talk about that more.

00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:25.040
What happens now is that the
stock of the envelope protein

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:30.440
pierces through from the
virus into the host cell

00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.610
and starts to draw the cell
membrane and the viral membrane

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:35.630
together.

00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:39.110
And what ultimately happens is
fusion of those two membranes

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:42.980
and the viral genetic material
is injected, essentially,

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.000
into the cell.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:46.910
And the envelope protein is
left at the cell surface.

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:49.340
- So that's the fusion process
that's so hard to explain.

00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:52.490
- The virus has a matrix and
a capsid protein, shown here

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:55.970
in green and red, that
essentially are digested

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.250
when it enters into the cell.

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:02.900
That releases the viral
enzymes and the viral RNA.

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.760
And here we have
reverse transcriptase,

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:10.190
which takes the viral RNA,
and using host nucleotides

00:44:10.190 --> 00:44:14.660
converts that viral RNA
into a single strand of DNA.

00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:17.880
While it does that, it
makes some random errors,

00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.420
which is characteristic
of reverse transcriptase.

00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:24.390
It has very poor
proofreading activity.

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:28.800
That single-stranded DNA, now,
is again reverse transcribed

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:30.620
into a double-stranded DNA.

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.660
At that point,
another enzyme that

00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:38.150
has come in with the virus
in the beginning, called

00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:40.670
integrase,
essentially grabs hold

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:43.700
of that double-stranded
DNA and carries it

00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:48.770
through a nuclear pore into
the nucleus of the cell.

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:52.640
Within the nucleus of the cell,
it finds the host chromosome.

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:55.130
And basically, the
integrase enzyme,

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:59.540
makes a nick in the host's
DNA and allows for HIV

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:02.750
to insert itself into
the host chromosome.

00:45:02.750 --> 00:45:08.580
And that right there is what
establishes lifelong infection.

00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.140
Now, RNA polymerase comes along
and makes its messenger RNA.

00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:15.320
- That's the host polymerase,
it's just back to normal now.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.490
- Those messenger RNAs encode
for different viral proteins.

00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:22.670
They end up associating
with ribosomes

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:25.850
at the surface of the rough
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:45:25.850 --> 00:45:27.830
And here is a piece
of mRNA that's

00:45:27.830 --> 00:45:31.370
making envelope protein
which is directly produced

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:33.830
into the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:37.160
And its shuttled, then, through
the endoplasmic reticulum

00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:41.190
and taken to the cell surface,
where, at the cell surface,

00:45:41.190 --> 00:45:43.850
it becomes embedded in
the cellular membrane.

00:45:43.850 --> 00:45:47.480
And at this point, coalescing
with other envelope proteins

00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.430
that have been produced
you have this cluster

00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:55.430
of envelope proteins now on the
surface of this infected cell.

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:59.570
At the same time, there
are other messenger RNAs

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:02.900
that are being produced
that allow for translation

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.370
of other viral proteins.

00:46:05.370 --> 00:46:08.330
So here are additional
viral proteins being made

00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:11.270
which are going to
be used to make up

00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:14.060
the key components that
the virus, ultimately,

00:46:14.060 --> 00:46:16.070
is going to need.

00:46:16.070 --> 00:46:18.530
These are transported
again to the cell surface,

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:21.560
to the area where these
envelope proteins are.

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:25.880
And a strand of RNA, as
well as some of the enzymes

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:29.640
are part of that complex.

00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:32.730
This then buds off at the
cell surface at this point,

00:46:32.730 --> 00:46:34.710
but it's still not
a mature virion

00:46:34.710 --> 00:46:40.170
because the polyprotein chain
needs to still be digested

00:46:40.170 --> 00:46:42.330
into its component parts.

00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:44.960
That's done by an
enzyme called protease.

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:48.930
Protease breaks up
those polyprotein chains

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:52.710
and, ultimately, allows for
them to coalesce and form

00:46:52.710 --> 00:46:57.390
the mature structures that
make up the final virion.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:00.360
And now you have a
mature infectious virion

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:04.840
that can go on now to
infect other cells.

00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:09.370
Once that happens, now, the cell
can produce tons of viruses.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:12.745
And this is really what, then,
keeps the whole process going.

00:47:12.745 --> 00:47:13.360
[END PLAYBACK]

00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:14.290
BARBARA IMPERIALI: OK.

00:47:14.290 --> 00:47:14.790
All right.

00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:17.830
So I have gone
monstrously long on HIV.

00:47:17.830 --> 00:47:22.390
So sadly, I cannot
get you to Ebola.

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:26.050
But I'll post those
slides anyway.

00:47:26.050 --> 00:47:30.070
This question just speaks
to combination therapies.

00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:33.980
So combination therapies
are very, very important,

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:36.220
particularly in cases
where resistance

00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:41.770
to individual therapeutic agents
against an individual target

00:47:41.770 --> 00:47:42.610
can happen.

00:47:42.610 --> 00:47:46.900
So HIV mutates its proteins
very, very rapidly.

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:51.940
But the likelihood that
it will simultaneously

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.970
mutate two targets in
one cell is much lower.

00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:58.930
So combination
therapies basically

00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:02.230
are there to avoid
drug resistance that

00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:04.660
occurs, usually, because
of the high mutation rate,

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:08.500
not because one drug has
a short half life, not

00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:10.990
so that multiple
strains can be targeted,

00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:13.510
or to decrease the
number of side effects.

00:48:13.510 --> 00:48:17.200
Obviously, combination therapies
give you more side effects,

00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.560
but they are really important
in mitigating the disease.

00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.240
So I was going to talk to you
about vaccine development,

00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:27.910
but I will discuss this
with Professor Martin

00:48:27.910 --> 00:48:32.080
to see if he wants
to take that over.

00:48:32.080 --> 00:48:36.330
But I want to leave you
with one last thing.

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:43.210
OK.

00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:44.920
Three small points.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:49.090
On next Wednesday, this
is Fred Flintstone.

00:48:49.090 --> 00:48:51.640
I tend to channel Fred
Flintstone because he

00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.950
wears this nice blue scarf.

00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:57.670
Next Wednesday is the
last of the classes.

00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:00.050
We've got some good
stuff lined up for you.

00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.590
We're going to have
the topoisomerase demo

00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:06.460
from some people who
submitted a topo demo for us.

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:08.770
And then we're going
to do 7.016 Jeopardy.

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:10.810
Now, don't think this
is going to be cheesy.

00:49:10.810 --> 00:49:12.160
It's going to be tough.

00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.660
And it's going to be fun.

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:15.610
And we're all going
to be involved.

00:49:15.610 --> 00:49:17.590
Professor Martin and
I will be the hosts.

00:49:17.590 --> 00:49:19.412
He's promised to dress up.

00:49:19.412 --> 00:49:22.130
Ha ha ha.

00:49:22.130 --> 00:49:24.880
Jackie will help
me run the program,

00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:27.460
because it's in a
real Jeopardy program.

00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:30.100
And Hannah and David
will keep scores.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.510
And we'd like to encourage you
who come to be in teams of two.

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:36.730
Otherwise, there will
be kind of a lot of you.

00:49:36.730 --> 00:49:39.980
So if when you come in, if you
sit on that side of the room,

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:42.850
put your two names
on these boards.

00:49:42.850 --> 00:49:45.760
And if you're on the other
side, put them on these boards

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:49.810
because Hannah and David will
be posted there to keep score.

00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:54.820
And we will muster up some
small prize for the winner here.

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.475
So, yes, question.

00:49:56.475 --> 00:49:58.100
AUDIENCE: Will this
count as the final?

00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:00.520
BARBARA IMPERIALI: No.

00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:03.220
That would be a heck of
an incentive, wouldn't it?

00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:05.770
What this will do
for you is actually

00:50:05.770 --> 00:50:08.620
kind of help you
refresh a lot of things,

00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:10.570
maybe identify blind spots.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:11.512
It was worth asking.

00:50:11.512 --> 00:50:12.720
It was a good question, yeah.

00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:17.770
So I'll post the questions
afterwards as well.

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:20.090
So you'll be able
to kind of say, guy,

00:50:20.090 --> 00:50:22.570
I don't know what this
question was about at all.

00:50:22.570 --> 00:50:25.150
And you can go and review
a little of the material.

00:50:25.150 --> 00:50:26.180
Nice try, though.

00:50:28.810 --> 00:50:31.090
Oh, and there was
one other thing.

00:50:31.090 --> 00:50:34.180
I just want to remind you
that a vote is a vote.

00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:36.280
This is a democratic society.

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.660
So you should please take time
to fill in the evaluations

00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:41.570
on the course.

00:50:41.570 --> 00:50:43.120
OK.

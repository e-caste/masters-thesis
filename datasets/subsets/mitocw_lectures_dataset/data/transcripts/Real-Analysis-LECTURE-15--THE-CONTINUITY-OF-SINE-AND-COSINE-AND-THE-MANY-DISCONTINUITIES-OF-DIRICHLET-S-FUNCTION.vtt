00:00:12.107 --> 00:00:12.940 align:middle line:90%
CASEY RODRIGUEZ: OK.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.170 align:middle line:84%
So let's continue our discussion
of continuity, which we began

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.985 align:middle line:90%
last time, which is--

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:26.250 align:middle line:90%


00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.550 align:middle line:84%
which I defined last time,
and I wrote again here,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:33.090 align:middle line:84%
which intuitively says
that if you want to be--

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.960 align:middle line:84%
that if x is sufficiently
close to number c,

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.640 align:middle line:84%
then f of x will be
very close to f of c.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.700 align:middle line:84%
So it connects how
the function behaves

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.120 align:middle line:84%
near a point to how a
function behaves at the point.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.070 align:middle line:84%
And last time, we
gave an example

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.660 align:middle line:84%
of a function
which is continuous

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.190 align:middle line:84%
everywhere, namely the function
f of x equals ax plus b,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.530 align:middle line:84%
and one that was not
continuous at a point c.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:10.370 align:middle line:90%
And we ended with--

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.920 align:middle line:90%


00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.330 align:middle line:84%
let me just recall the
question I asked last time.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:22.940 align:middle line:84%
If f is a function-- let's say
that its whole domain is r.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.800 align:middle line:90%


00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.660 align:middle line:84%
Does there exist a point
where it's continuous?

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:48.130 align:middle line:90%


00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.673 align:middle line:84%
Now, I could answer
this question now just

00:01:50.673 --> 00:01:52.840 align:middle line:84%
using the definition, but
I'll answer it in a minute

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.350 align:middle line:84%
after we prove the
following theorem, which

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.520 align:middle line:84%
is an analog of this theorem
that we proved here for limits.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.980 align:middle line:84%
We showed that if
you have a subset

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.610 align:middle line:84%
s of r, a cluster
point of s-- so this

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.610 align:middle line:84%
is where you take limits,
and then the limit

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.010 align:middle line:84%
as x goes to c of
f of x equals l

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.940 align:middle line:84%
if and only if, for every
sequence converging to c,

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.870 align:middle line:84%
we have f of xn, which is a
new sequence, converges to l.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.680 align:middle line:84%
So this connects
limits of functions

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.233 align:middle line:84%
to limits of sequences-- limits
along sequences, if you like.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:35.150 align:middle line:84%
We're going to prove an
analog of this theorem

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.910 align:middle line:84%
now for the notion
of continuity.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.705 align:middle line:90%
But there's kind of--

00:02:42.705 --> 00:02:45.847 align:middle line:84%
and these two definitions
certainly look--

00:02:45.847 --> 00:02:47.430 align:middle line:84%
if you look at the
definition of limit

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.620 align:middle line:84%
and the definition
of continuity,

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.350 align:middle line:84%
this one certainly looks
like the definition of limit

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.830 align:middle line:84%
where now the limit has to be
f of c, the function evaluated

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.670 align:middle line:90%
at that point.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.000 align:middle line:84%
And it essentially is, but we
do have a degenerate case where

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.760 align:middle line:84%
c here is not required to
be a cluster point of s.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.970 align:middle line:90%
It's just any point of s.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.660 align:middle line:84%
And we'll have two cases,
c is a cluster point of s

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.580 align:middle line:84%
and c is not a
cluster point of s.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.640 align:middle line:84%
And you'll see that when c
is not a cluster point of s,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.470 align:middle line:84%
we'll have a silly situation
for talking about continuity.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:33.200 align:middle line:84%
So this is the following A
theorem, which has three parts.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.420 align:middle line:90%
So suppose s is a subset of r.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.150 align:middle line:90%
c is an element of s.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.210 align:middle line:90%
f is a function from s to r.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:57.030 align:middle line:84%
So the first part is if c
is not a cluster point of s,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:04.090 align:middle line:90%
then f is continuous at c.

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.180 align:middle line:84%
So if we're looking at
continuity at a point,

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.920 align:middle line:84%
the only interesting
points to look at

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.380 align:middle line:90%
are cluster points of the set s.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.510 align:middle line:84%
Otherwise, no matter
what function it is,

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.880 align:middle line:84%
it will be continuous
at such a point.

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.230 align:middle line:90%


00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.720 align:middle line:90%
The second is that--

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.510 align:middle line:84%
now let's suppose we're in
the more interesting case

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.670 align:middle line:90%
that c is a cluster point of s.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:38.990 align:middle line:84%
Suppose c is a
cluster point of s,

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.260 align:middle line:84%
which is essentially the
only thing that doesn't--

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.780 align:middle line:84%
that's missing from this
definition and the definition

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.100 align:middle line:90%
for limit.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.090 align:middle line:90%
Then f is continuous at c.

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.460 align:middle line:84%
And this is borne
out in this theorem

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.920 align:middle line:84%
if and only if the limit
as x goes to c of f of x

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.000 align:middle line:90%
equals f of c.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.930 align:middle line:90%


00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.250 align:middle line:84%
And the third part
of this theorem,

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.510 align:middle line:84%
which is now the analog of
this theorem we proved here

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:17.010 align:middle line:90%
for limits, is the following--

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:30.720 align:middle line:84%
f is continuous at c if and
only if for every sequence

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:45.080 align:middle line:84%
xn of elements of s such
that x of n converges to c,

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:55.046 align:middle line:84%
we have f of x sub n
converges to f of c.

00:05:55.046 --> 00:05:59.140 align:middle line:90%


00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.810 align:middle line:84%
So again, if c is not a
cluster point of the set,

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.400 align:middle line:84%
then every function is going
to be continuous at that point.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.630 align:middle line:90%
So this is kind of a--

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.580 align:middle line:84%
so if c is not a
cluster point of s,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.160 align:middle line:90%
this is a silly case to look at.

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.970 align:middle line:90%


00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:15.470 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.825 align:middle line:84%
So let's prove the
first theorem--

00:06:18.825 --> 00:06:20.450 align:middle line:84%
I mean, the first
part of this theorem.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:25.300 align:middle line:90%


00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:29.360 align:middle line:90%
So what's the intuition?

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.100 align:middle line:84%
Remember, continuity
is a connection

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.210 align:middle line:84%
between f near a point and
the function at the point.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:40.040 align:middle line:84%
Now, if the only points
near c is c, then

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.250 align:middle line:84%
f of x equals f of c for x
near c because x can only be c.

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.150 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, that will
be less than epsilon.

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:55.370 align:middle line:84%
So when we're at a point
that's not a cluster point,

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.450 align:middle line:84%
it kind of removes
the near part.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:02.105 align:middle line:84%
And we're just looking at f at c
and comparing f to itself at c.

00:07:02.105 --> 00:07:04.960 align:middle line:90%


00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.410 align:middle line:84%
So let's suppose f is
not a cluster point.

00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:11.358 align:middle line:90%


00:07:11.358 --> 00:07:13.150 align:middle line:84%
So we want to prove
continuity, so that's a

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.070 align:middle line:90%
for all epsilon delta argument.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.380 align:middle line:90%
So let epsilon be positive.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:31.270 align:middle line:84%
Since c is not a cluster point
of s, what does this mean?

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.180 align:middle line:84%
So remember, to
be a cluster point

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:40.240 align:middle line:84%
of a set s means for all
delta positive, there exists--

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.490 align:middle line:84%
so let me recall what
it means to be a cluster

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:47.160 align:middle line:90%
point over here on the side.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:56.210 align:middle line:90%
So c is a cluster point of s.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:02.690 align:middle line:84%
This means for all delta
positive, the set x minus delta

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:09.070 align:middle line:84%
x plus delta
intersect c, intersect

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:13.270 align:middle line:90%
s takeaway c is not empty.

00:08:13.270 --> 00:08:16.910 align:middle line:90%


00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.950 align:middle line:84%
So since c is not
a cluster point,

00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:23.240 align:middle line:84%
that means there
exists some delta 0 so

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.680 align:middle line:84%
that this interval is disjoint
from s takeaway c such

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.309 align:middle line:84%
that c minus delta
0, c plus delta

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:41.159 align:middle line:84%
0 intersect s takeaway
c equals the empty set.

00:08:41.159 --> 00:08:45.770 align:middle line:84%
Now, if I include c
in this intersection--

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.590 align:middle line:90%


00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.910 align:middle line:84%
so another way of stating
this is that the only thing--

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:55.750 align:middle line:84%
since c is an element
of s, the only thing

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.740 align:middle line:84%
that's in this
intersection is c.

00:08:59.740 --> 00:09:06.490 align:middle line:90%


00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:13.440 align:middle line:84%
So this here is the
rigorous way of saying

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.290 align:middle line:84%
there's nothing in s near
c except for c itself.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.870 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, there's
nothing to compare to f of c.

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:24.690 align:middle line:84%
So we'll choose delta to be
this one because then there's

00:09:24.690 --> 00:09:25.380 align:middle line:90%
nothing--

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.920 align:middle line:84%
there's no x in s in this
interval other than c.

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.100 align:middle line:84%
And then f of c
minus f of c is 0,

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:38.760 align:middle line:90%
so choose delta to be delta 0.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.875 align:middle line:90%
And if x minus--

00:09:40.875 --> 00:09:46.170 align:middle line:90%


00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:51.160 align:middle line:84%
so now we want to say
that this delta works.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:55.800 align:middle line:84%
So if x is in s and x
minus c is less than delta,

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.560 align:middle line:90%
that implies x equals c.

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:04.980 align:middle line:84%
Because the only thing in this
interval that's coming from s

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:05.850 align:middle line:90%
is c.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:09.750 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, f
of x minus f of c--

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.250 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to f
of c minus f of c

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.155 align:middle line:84%
equals 0, which is
less than epsilon.

00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:20.180 align:middle line:90%


00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:23.510 align:middle line:84%
So this is a really
degenerate case

00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:26.300 align:middle line:84%
of when you're trying
to see if a function is

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.770 align:middle line:90%
continuous at a certain point.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:40.310 align:middle line:90%


00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:40.810 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:43.390 align:middle line:84%
So let's now move to the
more interesting part

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.740 align:middle line:90%
that sees a cluster point.

00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:55.020 align:middle line:90%


00:10:55.020 --> 00:11:00.520 align:middle line:84%
So suppose c is a
cluster point of s.

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.070 align:middle line:84%
And we want to show f is
continuous at c if and only

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:07.480 align:middle line:84%
if the limit of f as x goes
to c of f of x equals f of c.

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.560 align:middle line:84%
Going this direction
is really quite easy,

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.670 align:middle line:84%
so we're going to
go this direction.

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:15.940 align:middle line:84%
And you should be able to
prove this direction just

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:18.020 align:middle line:90%
from what I write down here.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:29.060 align:middle line:84%
So suppose the limit as x goes
to c of f of x equals f of c.

00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:32.340 align:middle line:84%
I mean, this whole
argument is kind of silly

00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:38.620 align:middle line:84%
because the definitions are
just so close except for now c

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:40.120 align:middle line:84%
is a cluster point,
so that's not

00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:43.240 align:middle line:90%
missing from either definition.

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.680 align:middle line:84%
But the only difference is this
guy, you only look at x near c

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:50.800 align:middle line:90%
but not at c.

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:53.830 align:middle line:84%
So suppose the limit as x goes
to c of f of x equals f of c.

00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:56.170 align:middle line:84%
Now we want to show
that f of x is--

00:11:56.170 --> 00:12:01.360 align:middle line:84%
that f is continuous at c,
so let epsilon be positive.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:04.800 align:middle line:90%


00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:14.550 align:middle line:84%
Since we have this, there
exists a delta positive such

00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:30.350 align:middle line:84%
that if x is in s and the
absolute value of x minus c

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:33.530 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than 0 is
less than delta 0,

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:40.850 align:middle line:84%
then f of x minus f of
c is less than epsilon.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.070 align:middle line:84%
And we'll just choose
delta to be this delta 0.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:51.590 align:middle line:90%


00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.940 align:middle line:84%
If x minus c is less than delta
0, then there are two cases.

00:12:55.940 --> 00:12:59.948 align:middle line:84%
Either x is equal to c
or x is not equal to z.

00:12:59.948 --> 00:13:00.448 align:middle line:90%
See?

00:13:00.448 --> 00:13:04.440 align:middle line:90%


00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.820 align:middle line:90%
So let's write it this way.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:18.030 align:middle line:90%


00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:25.460 align:middle line:84%
If x equals c, then
clearly, f of x minus f of c

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle line:84%
equals f of c minus f of c
equals 0 is less than epsilon.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:34.230 align:middle line:90%


00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:42.730 align:middle line:84%
And if x is not equal to c, then
that's certainly bigger than 0,

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:44.740 align:middle line:84%
but we're still assuming
it's less than delta,

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.310 align:middle line:84%
which remember, is this
delta 0 coming from the fact

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:52.390 align:middle line:84%
that the limit as x
goes to c of f of x--

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.560 align:middle line:90%
I missed that there--

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.310 align:middle line:90%


00:13:56.310 --> 00:14:05.880 align:middle line:84%
tells me that this
is less than epsilon.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:12.122 align:middle line:84%
So it just follows immediately
from the definition.

00:14:12.122 --> 00:14:13.080 align:middle line:90%
There's not much to it.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.490 align:middle line:90%


00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:18.990 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:14:18.990 --> 00:14:24.330 align:middle line:84%
So now let's prove the third
part of this theorem, which

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:31.200 align:middle line:84%
is an analog of that theorem
we have over there for limits.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:38.240 align:middle line:90%


00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.780 align:middle line:90%
So let's prove this direction.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:49.167 align:middle line:84%
Let's suppose f is
continuous at c,

00:14:49.167 --> 00:14:51.500 align:middle line:84%
and now we want to prove this
statement about sequences.

00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.900 align:middle line:90%
So let me also--

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.610 align:middle line:84%
when I prove the
opposite direction,

00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:56.930 align:middle line:90%
not have to label it.

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:58.140 align:middle line:90%
So let me put a star.

00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:01.730 align:middle line:84%
This star is going to
be the right-hand side

00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:02.690 align:middle line:90%
of this statement.

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:08.650 align:middle line:90%


00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:21.660 align:middle line:84%
So let x sub n be a sequence
in s of elements of s such

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.430 align:middle line:90%
that x converges to c.

00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:27.230 align:middle line:90%


00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:32.030 align:middle line:84%
Now, I drew this
picture for limits,

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:34.145 align:middle line:84%
and it's the same
picture now for this guy.

00:15:34.145 --> 00:15:37.260 align:middle line:90%


00:15:37.260 --> 00:15:43.950 align:middle line:84%
And we're wanting to show
now that the limit as n

00:15:43.950 --> 00:15:49.890 align:middle line:84%
goes to infinity of f of
x sub n equals f of c.

00:15:49.890 --> 00:15:56.300 align:middle line:84%
So here's the
epsilon m argument,

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:57.660 align:middle line:90%
so let epsilon be positive.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.070 align:middle line:90%
So now I'll go to the picture.

00:15:59.070 --> 00:16:01.040 align:middle line:90%
Here's f of c.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:07.110 align:middle line:84%
Here's f of c plus epsilon,
f of c minus epsilon.

00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:08.640 align:middle line:90%
So what do we know?

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.660 align:middle line:84%
We know the function
is continuous at c.

00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.970 align:middle line:84%
So that means that
if I look at c, then

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:27.840 align:middle line:84%
there exists a delta so that
if I'm in this interval here,

00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.710 align:middle line:84%
everything in this interval
gets mapped to inside

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:32.520 align:middle line:90%
of this interval.

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:36.850 align:middle line:90%


00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:40.150 align:middle line:84%
Now, what else do I know
or what else am I assuming?

00:16:40.150 --> 00:16:42.340 align:middle line:84%
x sub n is a sequence
converging to s.

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:50.690 align:middle line:84%
So for large n, for n big
enough for some capital M0,

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.720 align:middle line:84%
x sub n is going to lie
inside this interval.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.080 align:middle line:84%
If you like, in the definition
of convergence of a sequence,

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.540 align:middle line:84%
epsilon is equal to
delta in that definition.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:02.780 align:middle line:90%
But don't mind that.

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:06.540 align:middle line:84%
So for all n big enough, x
sub n lies in this interval.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.200 align:middle line:84%
And since this
interval gets mapped

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.000 align:middle line:84%
inside this interval
by f, this f of x

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.930 align:middle line:84%
sub n will end up in this
interval within epsilon

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:22.050 align:middle line:84%
to f of c as long
as n is big enough.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:25.650 align:middle line:84%
And so this picture I just went
through, this is the proof.

00:17:25.650 --> 00:17:27.240 align:middle line:84%
And now we just need
to write it out.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:39.440 align:middle line:90%


00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.190 align:middle line:84%
Since f is continuous
at c, there

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:54.690 align:middle line:84%
exists a delta positive
such that if x minus c is

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:59.640 align:middle line:84%
less than delta, this
tells me f of x minus f

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.755 align:middle line:90%
of c is less than epsilon.

00:18:01.755 --> 00:18:05.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:10.880 align:middle line:84%
Now, since the sequence
x sub n converges to c,

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.540 align:middle line:84%
there exists some
integer capital M0

00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:22.100 align:middle line:84%
such that for all n bigger
than or equal to 0, x

00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.440 align:middle line:84%
sub n minus c is
less than delta.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:27.470 align:middle line:90%


00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:30.290 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, for all n bigger
than or equal to m sub 0,

00:18:30.290 --> 00:18:36.170 align:middle line:84%
f of x in will be within
epsilon of f of c.

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:38.315 align:middle line:90%
So this will be the m we choose.

00:18:38.315 --> 00:18:40.960 align:middle line:90%


00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:47.070 align:middle line:84%
Then if n is bigger
than or equal to M,

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:53.490 align:middle line:84%
we get that x sub n minus x
minus c is less than delta,

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:57.570 align:middle line:84%
which implies by how
delta's defined--

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.740 align:middle line:84%
if x minus c is within distance
delta, f of x minus f of c

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:04.170 align:middle line:90%
is within distance epsilon.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:13.580 align:middle line:84%
We get f of x sub n minus f
of c is less than epsilon.

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:18.690 align:middle line:90%


00:19:18.690 --> 00:19:20.190 align:middle line:90%
So that gives us one direction.

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:29.650 align:middle line:90%


00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:30.150 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:32.830 align:middle line:84%
So now we'll prove the
opposite direction.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:44.530 align:middle line:84%
So we're assuming that this
statement star holds, namely

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:46.630 align:middle line:84%
for all sequence x
sub n's converging

00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:50.200 align:middle line:84%
to c, we have f of x sub
n converging to f of c.

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.810 align:middle line:84%
And we want to prove
that the limit or that f

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:57.040 align:middle line:90%
is continuous at c.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:02.780 align:middle line:90%


00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.090 align:middle line:84%
And we're going to do this
by contradiction, which

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:07.820 align:middle line:84%
is the same way we proved
the opposite direction

00:20:07.820 --> 00:20:10.460 align:middle line:90%
for the theorem about limits.

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:18.320 align:middle line:84%
So the proof is by
contradiction, namely

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.730 align:middle line:84%
suppose the conclusion
we want does not hold.

00:20:20.730 --> 00:20:30.110 align:middle line:84%
So suppose f is not
continuous at c.

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.160 align:middle line:84%
So let me recall we negated that
definition in the last lecture,

00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.660 align:middle line:90%
but we'll negate it again.

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:40.710 align:middle line:84%
For this, this means that
there exists a bad epsilon

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:46.350 align:middle line:84%
so that for all delta
positive, there exists an x

00:20:46.350 --> 00:20:51.570 align:middle line:84%
and s satisfying x minus
c is less than delta.

00:20:51.570 --> 00:21:00.570 align:middle line:84%
And f of x minus f of c
is bigger than or equal

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.620 align:middle line:90%
to epsilon 0.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:11.162 align:middle line:90%


00:21:11.162 --> 00:21:11.750 align:middle line:90%
All right.

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:16.220 align:middle line:84%
So since we're assuming
f is not continuous

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:20.490 align:middle line:84%
or exists at epsilon
0, so we have all this,

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.650 align:middle line:90%
which holds for every delta.

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:26.550 align:middle line:84%
And now we'll choose delta
to be 1, 1/2, 1/3, and so on.

00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:29.520 align:middle line:90%


00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:34.050 align:middle line:84%
Then there exists
x sub 1 in s such

00:21:34.050 --> 00:21:38.670 align:middle line:84%
that x sub 1 minus
c is less than 1

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:45.630 align:middle line:84%
and f of x sub 1 minus f of c is
bigger than or equal to epsilon

00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:46.170 align:middle line:90%
0.

00:21:46.170 --> 00:21:47.160 align:middle line:90%
That's just delta.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.750 align:middle line:90%
If you like delta, equals 1.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:53.670 align:middle line:90%


00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:54.705 align:middle line:90%
And now we continue.

00:21:54.705 --> 00:21:57.585 align:middle line:90%


00:21:57.585 --> 00:22:01.170 align:middle line:84%
There exists x
sub 2 in this such

00:22:01.170 --> 00:22:05.490 align:middle line:84%
that x sub 2 minus
c is less than 1/2.

00:22:05.490 --> 00:22:09.510 align:middle line:84%
And so here, this
is delta equals 1/2.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:14.160 align:middle line:90%


00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:17.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is delta
equals 1/2, and so on.

00:22:17.250 --> 00:22:18.540 align:middle line:90%
So then we conclude--

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:22.590 align:middle line:90%


00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.640 align:middle line:84%
so if you like, omit
this from the proof.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.810 align:middle line:84%
And this is really what's
behind the next statement

00:22:30.810 --> 00:22:32.220 align:middle line:90%
I'm about to make.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:36.180 align:middle line:84%
Then for all natural
numbers n, there

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:46.560 align:middle line:84%
exists an x sub n in s such that
x sub n minus c is less than 1

00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:53.760 align:middle line:84%
over n, and f of x
sub n minus f of c

00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:55.620 align:middle line:84%
is bigger than or
equal to epsilon 0.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:00.770 align:middle line:90%


00:23:00.770 --> 00:23:03.200 align:middle line:84%
Now let's take a look
at this sequence.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.480 align:middle line:90%
We're trying to break something.

00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.990 align:middle line:84%
And we'll end up breaking
the star assumption.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:11.630 align:middle line:84%
So now we have this
sequence, x sub n

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:16.610 align:middle line:84%
of s, which we're getting
closer and closer to c.

00:23:16.610 --> 00:23:20.810 align:middle line:84%
So we have 0 is bigger than
or equal to x sub n minus

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.100 align:middle line:90%
c is bigger--

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.480 align:middle line:90%
is less than 1 over n.

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.820 align:middle line:90%
So this converges to 0.

00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.620 align:middle line:90%
This converges to 0.

00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:29.810 align:middle line:84%
So by the squeeze theorem,
the absolute value

00:23:29.810 --> 00:23:33.200 align:middle line:84%
of x sub n minus
c converges to 0.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:38.110 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, x sub
n converges to c.

00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:44.230 align:middle line:84%
By squeeze theorem, we get
that xn converges to c.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.360 align:middle line:84%
Now, since we're
assuming star holds--

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:52.540 align:middle line:84%
that's the right side of
3, of the if and only if--

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:56.340 align:middle line:84%
it must be the case that f
of xn converges to f of c.

00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:11.570 align:middle line:90%


00:24:11.570 --> 00:24:13.430 align:middle line:84%
That's what star
tells me-- that if I

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:17.570 align:middle line:84%
take a sequence converging to
c, f of x converges to f of c.

00:24:17.570 --> 00:24:21.250 align:middle line:84%
But each one of
these, remember, is

00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:31.830 align:middle line:84%
bigger than or equal to epsilon
0, which is a contradiction.

00:24:31.830 --> 00:24:33.375 align:middle line:90%
Epsilon 0 is a positive number.

00:24:33.375 --> 00:24:36.980 align:middle line:90%


00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:43.930 align:middle line:84%
And that concludes the
proof of this theorem.

00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:46.240 align:middle line:84%
That gives us an equivalent
way of stating continuity

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.320 align:middle line:90%
in terms of sequences.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:52.660 align:middle line:84%
And just like for
limits, this will

00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:57.580 align:middle line:84%
allow us to use what we know
about sequences to conclude

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:00.430 align:middle line:84%
analogous facts for
continuous functions.

00:25:00.430 --> 00:25:15.340 align:middle line:90%


00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.800 align:middle line:84%
So let's look at a
non-trivial example

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:22.570 align:middle line:84%
of a continuous function
and also put this theorem

00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:26.830 align:middle line:90%
to use, this previous theorem.

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:38.800 align:middle line:84%
The functions f of x equals sine
x and g of x equals cosine x,

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.420 align:middle line:90%
these are continuous functions.

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:50.720 align:middle line:84%
So meaning their domain is
the set of real numbers,

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:53.320 align:middle line:84%
so they're continuous
at every real number.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.020 align:middle line:84%
They're continuous at c
for every c, a real number.

00:25:56.020 --> 00:26:00.680 align:middle line:90%


00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.050 align:middle line:90%
So we're going to use this--

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:07.220 align:middle line:90%


00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.310 align:middle line:84%
well, we're not going to
use this theorem just yet

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:10.010 align:middle line:90%
on this part.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.385 align:middle line:84%
We're actually going to prove
sine is continuous directly

00:26:12.385 --> 00:26:17.590 align:middle line:84%
from the epsilon delta
definition, which is always

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:18.090 align:middle line:90%
good.

00:26:18.090 --> 00:26:27.360 align:middle line:90%
So first, we claim sine x.

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.790 align:middle line:84%
So before I say what
we're going to do,

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:31.380 align:middle line:84%
let me just give you
a quick refresher

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:34.350 align:middle line:84%
on what you can prove just
from the definition of sine

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.860 align:middle line:90%
and cosine.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.860 align:middle line:90%
Remember, I'm not--

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.750 align:middle line:90%


00:26:42.750 --> 00:26:46.470 align:middle line:84%
I would usually put this to
the class and see who remembers

00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:47.520 align:middle line:90%
and who doesn't.

00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.040 align:middle line:84%
So this is also supposed to
be a unit circle, although it

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:52.290 align:middle line:90%
doesn't quite look like that.

00:26:52.290 --> 00:26:58.170 align:middle line:84%
Remember that sine and cosine
are defined as you travel along

00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:01.440 align:middle line:84%
signed distance x
along the circle,

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:12.140 align:middle line:84%
and you arrive at a point on
the unit circle, which you--

00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:13.910 align:middle line:90%
so it's an ordered pair.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:16.340 align:middle line:84%
The first element
you call cosine x.

00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:18.050 align:middle line:84%
The second element
you call sine x.

00:27:18.050 --> 00:27:20.910 align:middle line:84%
So that's how sine
of x is defined.

00:27:20.910 --> 00:27:24.050 align:middle line:90%
So now simply--

00:27:24.050 --> 00:27:29.180 align:middle line:84%
I'm not going to do this because
this is trig, not analysis.

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:37.770 align:middle line:84%
But from the definition
of sine and cosine

00:27:37.770 --> 00:27:53.930 align:middle line:84%
from the unit circle,
we have that, of course,

00:27:53.930 --> 00:28:00.980 align:middle line:84%
all x and r sine x plus cosine
squared x is equal to 1.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.040 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, each of
these individual things

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:06.200 align:middle line:84%
has to be less than or
equal to 1, which upon

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:08.345 align:middle line:90%
taking square roots means that--

00:28:08.345 --> 00:28:20.130 align:middle line:90%


00:28:20.130 --> 00:28:21.870 align:middle line:90%
so you have these.

00:28:21.870 --> 00:28:26.130 align:middle line:84%
Now, you can also make a
better estimate for sine x

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:31.800 align:middle line:84%
when x is close to 0, which is
only useful for x close to 0,

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.980 align:middle line:84%
but which is the
following-- that for all x,

00:28:34.980 --> 00:28:41.370 align:middle line:84%
sine x is less than or equal to
the absolute value of x, just

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:48.310 align:middle line:84%
obtained by comparing the
length of one side of a triangle

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:50.305 align:middle line:84%
from this picture with
the length of the arc.

00:28:50.305 --> 00:28:54.382 align:middle line:90%


00:28:54.382 --> 00:28:55.840 align:middle line:84%
So you have this,
and then you also

00:28:55.840 --> 00:29:06.560 align:middle line:84%
have the angle
sum formula, which

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:14.450 align:middle line:84%
says that sine of a plus
b equals sine a cosine b

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:18.770 align:middle line:90%
plus cosine a sine b.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:21.640 align:middle line:90%


00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.930 align:middle line:90%
And you also have the--

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.560 align:middle line:84%
I can't remember the name
of the exact formula.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:34.330 align:middle line:84%
I think it's difference to
product or something of that

00:29:34.330 --> 00:29:43.060 align:middle line:84%
nature, which says sine of a
minus sine a b, you can write--

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.700 align:middle line:84%
so this is using the
previous formula--

00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:53.380 align:middle line:84%
twice sine of a minus b over
2 cosine of a plus b over 2.

00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:59.370 align:middle line:90%


00:29:59.370 --> 00:30:02.850 align:middle line:84%
So using these elementary
properties of sine and cosine,

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:06.660 align:middle line:84%
we'll now show that
sine of x is continuous.

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:12.080 align:middle line:90%


00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:23.200 align:middle line:84%
So first thing we want
to show is that sine x

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.605 align:middle line:90%
is a continuous function.

00:30:26.605 --> 00:30:29.780 align:middle line:90%


00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:30.580 align:middle line:90%
So let's see.

00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:35.120 align:middle line:84%
In R, we're going to show
sine is continuous at c.

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.190 align:middle line:90%
Let epsilon be positive.

00:30:38.190 --> 00:30:40.757 align:middle line:84%
And now we have to say
how to choose delta

00:30:40.757 --> 00:30:41.840 align:middle line:90%
depending on this epsilon.

00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:46.470 align:middle line:90%


00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:47.670 align:middle line:90%
Choose delta to be epsilon.

00:30:47.670 --> 00:30:52.732 align:middle line:90%


00:30:52.732 --> 00:30:54.440 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll use these
elementary properties

00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.420 align:middle line:90%
to show that this delta works.

00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.950 align:middle line:90%


00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:05.980 align:middle line:84%
Then if x minus c
is less than delta,

00:31:05.980 --> 00:31:10.540 align:middle line:84%
we now want to show that f of x
minus f of c, sine x minus sine

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.230 align:middle line:90%
c, is less than epsilon.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:15.400 align:middle line:84%
So sine x minus sine
c, this is equal to--

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:23.520 align:middle line:84%
by this last formula we
have on the board over here,

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.310 align:middle line:84%
this is equal to
twice sine x minus c

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:35.550 align:middle line:90%
over 2 cosine x plus c over 2.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.940 align:middle line:84%
And now this is the product
of 2 times the absolute value

00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.520 align:middle line:84%
of sine times absolute
value of cosine.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.560 align:middle line:84%
By the second
property over here,

00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.140 align:middle line:84%
cosine is always bounded
by 1, so this is less than

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:53.660 align:middle line:84%
or equal to 2 times the absolute
value of sine x minus c over 2.

00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:56.270 align:middle line:84%
And now we use this
third property here

00:31:56.270 --> 00:31:59.815 align:middle line:84%
that sine x is less than or
equal to the absolute value

00:31:59.815 --> 00:32:01.190 align:middle line:84%
of that thing
you're sticking in.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:06.800 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than or equal
to 2 times x minus c over 2,

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.260 align:middle line:90%
which equals x minus c.

00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:10.670 align:middle line:90%
So now we're in business.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:14.450 align:middle line:84%
We've connected f
of x to x minus c.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:16.430 align:middle line:84%
So this is less than
or equal to-- so this

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:21.650 align:middle line:84%
is less than delta, which equals
epsilon by our choice of delta.

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:24.875 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, sine x minus
sine c is less than epsilon.

00:32:24.875 --> 00:32:30.620 align:middle line:90%


00:32:30.620 --> 00:32:34.980 align:middle line:84%
Sine x minus sine c
is less than epsilon.

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:45.920 align:middle line:84%
So thus, function sine
x is continuous at c.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:52.530 align:middle line:90%


00:32:52.530 --> 00:32:58.920 align:middle line:84%
Now we'll use this and the
theorem we showed a minute ago.

00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:01.920 align:middle line:90%


00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.000 align:middle line:90%
Have I erased it?

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.830 align:middle line:84%
Yes, I have now
officially erased it.

00:33:04.830 --> 00:33:06.690 align:middle line:84%
Anyways, we used
the previous theorem

00:33:06.690 --> 00:33:09.840 align:middle line:84%
that we proved for the
equivalence of continuity

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:14.850 align:middle line:84%
and convergence of sequences to
show that cosine is continuous.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:19.720 align:middle line:90%


00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:31.310 align:middle line:84%
So let c be an
element of R. Let xn

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:39.070 align:middle line:90%
be a sequence converging to c.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:50.920 align:middle line:84%
And we now want to show
that cosine of x sub n

00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:55.612 align:middle line:90%
converges to cosine of c.

00:33:55.612 --> 00:33:57.320 align:middle line:84%
Once we've done that,
then by the theorem

00:33:57.320 --> 00:34:00.910 align:middle line:84%
we proved previously,
we can conclude

00:34:00.910 --> 00:34:02.650 align:middle line:90%
that cosine is continuous at c.

00:34:02.650 --> 00:34:09.598 align:middle line:90%


00:34:09.598 --> 00:34:10.515 align:middle line:90%
Now, here's the thing.

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:13.595 align:middle line:90%


00:34:13.595 --> 00:34:23.790 align:middle line:84%
For all x and r,
we have cosine of x

00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:29.010 align:middle line:84%
is equal to sine of
x plus pi over 2.

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.545 align:middle line:84%
We can deduce that simply
from this angle sum formula.

00:34:31.545 --> 00:34:34.850 align:middle line:90%


00:34:34.850 --> 00:34:37.280 align:middle line:84%
Take a equals c, b
equals pi over 2.

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.870 align:middle line:90%


00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:43.000 align:middle line:84%
I'm using that cosine
of pi over 2 is 0.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.699 align:middle line:90%


00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:50.420 align:middle line:84%
And this is what we'll use,
and the fact that we know sine

00:34:50.420 --> 00:34:51.530 align:middle line:90%
is continuous.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:54.949 align:middle line:84%
Since the sequence
xn converges to c,

00:34:54.949 --> 00:35:01.700 align:middle line:84%
this implies the sequence x
sub n plus pi over 2 converges

00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:03.320 align:middle line:90%
to c plus pi over 2.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:06.000 align:middle line:90%


00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.390 align:middle line:84%
Now, this sequence x sub
n plus pi over 2 converges

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:12.450 align:middle line:90%
to this number.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:15.080 align:middle line:84%
And since sine is
continuous, we have

00:35:15.080 --> 00:35:21.740 align:middle line:84%
by the previous theorem that
sine of this converges to this.

00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:24.830 align:middle line:90%
And therefore, cosine of--

00:35:24.830 --> 00:35:29.331 align:middle line:90%


00:35:29.331 --> 00:35:36.530 align:middle line:84%
cosine of x sub n, which
is equal to sine of x sub n

00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:43.760 align:middle line:84%
plus pi over 2, converges to
sine of c plus pi over 2, which

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:48.735 align:middle line:90%
equals cosine of c, i.e.

00:35:48.735 --> 00:35:56.230 align:middle line:90%


00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:58.600 align:middle line:84%
cosine of x sub n
converges to cosine of c.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:03.100 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, we've now shown
that cosine is also continuous.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:17.140 align:middle line:90%


00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:19.040 align:middle line:84%
So let's answer this
question real quick.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:22.570 align:middle line:90%
So the answer is no.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:27.340 align:middle line:84%
You can find a function
which is discontinuous

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:29.245 align:middle line:84%
at every point,
every real number.

00:36:29.245 --> 00:36:34.240 align:middle line:90%


00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.418 align:middle line:84%
So maybe this is an example
rather than a theorem,

00:36:36.418 --> 00:36:37.710 align:middle line:90%
but I'll state it as a theorem.

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:41.490 align:middle line:90%


00:36:41.490 --> 00:36:44.210 align:middle line:84%
Let f of x be the function
which takes the value

00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:56.220 align:middle line:84%
1 if x is irrational, 0
if x is not irrational.

00:36:56.220 --> 00:37:02.170 align:middle line:90%


00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:17.180 align:middle line:84%
Then f is not continuous
at every c and r.

00:37:17.180 --> 00:37:21.120 align:middle line:84%
So first off, don't
try to plot this

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.370 align:middle line:84%
using Matlab or
Mathematica or anything

00:37:23.370 --> 00:37:26.190 align:middle line:84%
because first off,
computers can't

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.270 align:middle line:90%
deal with irrational numbers.

00:37:28.270 --> 00:37:32.220 align:middle line:84%
So you will just get 1 no
matter what you stick into f.

00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:36.970 align:middle line:90%


00:37:36.970 --> 00:37:37.470 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.200 align:middle line:84%
So you have this function,
which is 1 if x is a rational 0.

00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:44.100 align:middle line:84%
If x is not a rational
number, if it's irrational,

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.262 align:middle line:84%
let's show it's
discontinuous at every c.

00:37:46.262 --> 00:37:49.160 align:middle line:90%


00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:54.080 align:middle line:84%
A different way, if you like,
to state the theorem which

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:54.965 align:middle line:90%
I've already erased--

00:37:54.965 --> 00:37:58.310 align:middle line:90%


00:37:58.310 --> 00:38:00.650 align:middle line:84%
but let me just state
it slightly differently.

00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:04.510 align:middle line:90%


00:38:04.510 --> 00:38:09.450 align:middle line:90%
f is not continuous at c.

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:13.398 align:middle line:84%
So remember, the two
statements are equivalent if

00:38:13.398 --> 00:38:15.190 align:middle line:84%
and only if their
negations are equivalent.

00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:19.500 align:middle line:84%
So f is not continuous
at c if and only

00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:33.310 align:middle line:84%
if there exists a sequence
x sub n such that xn

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:38.480 align:middle line:90%
converges to c and f of xn--

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:41.820 align:middle line:90%


00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:51.390 align:middle line:84%
the sequence fn of xn does
not converge to f of c.

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:53.460 align:middle line:84%
So maybe it just
doesn't converge at all,

00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:56.833 align:middle line:84%
or maybe it converges to
something other than f of c.

00:38:56.833 --> 00:38:59.250 align:middle line:84%
So this is just a restatement
of the theorem we've already

00:38:59.250 --> 00:39:03.150 align:middle line:84%
proven but now using negations
of the statements that

00:39:03.150 --> 00:39:06.650 align:middle line:90%
appeared on the if and only if.

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:10.010 align:middle line:84%
So there's two cases
to consider for this.

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.070 align:middle line:90%
So now we're going--

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:15.680 align:middle line:84%
so this is a statement of
the theorem that we're--

00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:17.630 align:middle line:84%
a restatement of the
theorem we're using.

00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:20.910 align:middle line:84%
And now we're going to prove the
theorem that I've stated here.

00:39:20.910 --> 00:39:23.540 align:middle line:84%
So let c be an
element of R. We're

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:26.690 align:middle line:84%
going to show that this
function is discontinuous at c.

00:39:26.690 --> 00:39:30.110 align:middle line:84%
There are two cases to
consider, c is a rational number

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:33.420 align:middle line:90%
or c is an irrational number.

00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:40.430 align:middle line:84%
So case 1-- c is
a rational number.

00:39:40.430 --> 00:39:42.440 align:middle line:84%
Let's show f is not
continuous at c.

00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:50.870 align:middle line:90%


00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:57.690 align:middle line:84%
Now, we know that for
every natural number n,

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:07.460 align:middle line:84%
there exists an element x sub
n and the complement of q,

00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:13.160 align:middle line:84%
so an irrational number, such
that c is less than x sub n

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.650 align:middle line:90%
is less than c plus 1 over n.

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:17.750 align:middle line:84%
So we proved this
in an assignment.

00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:19.850 align:middle line:84%
Between any two
real numbers, I can

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:22.190 align:middle line:84%
find a rational number,
an irrational number

00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:24.040 align:middle line:90%
in between them.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:27.640 align:middle line:84%
So that's what this statement
says, is for each n,

00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.550 align:middle line:84%
I can find an irrational
number between the number c

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:32.510 align:middle line:90%
and the number c plus 1 over n.

00:40:32.510 --> 00:40:37.450 align:middle line:90%


00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:41.480 align:middle line:84%
Now, by the squeeze
theorem, this

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:44.750 align:middle line:84%
is just a constant sequence,
if you like, converging to c.

00:40:44.750 --> 00:40:45.980 align:middle line:90%
This convergence to c.

00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:48.740 align:middle line:84%
And as n goes to infinity,
this convergence to c.

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:54.660 align:middle line:84%
So I get that the sequence
x sub n converges to c.

00:40:54.660 --> 00:41:00.500 align:middle line:84%
This will be my bad sequence
to satisfy this conclusion

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:01.000 align:middle line:90%
because--

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.750 align:middle line:90%


00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:16.424 align:middle line:84%
so xn converges to c,
but if I look at f of xn,

00:41:16.424 --> 00:41:21.440 align:middle line:84%
if I take the limit as n
goes to infinity of f of xn,

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.120 align:middle line:84%
since all the xn's
are not rational--

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:25.730 align:middle line:90%
they're irrational numbers--

00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:27.965 align:middle line:84%
and I stick them
into f, I get 0.

00:41:27.965 --> 00:41:32.940 align:middle line:90%


00:41:32.940 --> 00:41:35.890 align:middle line:84%
And this does not
equal 1, which equals

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:40.530 align:middle line:84%
f of c because we're in the case
that c is a rational number.

00:41:40.530 --> 00:41:43.740 align:middle line:84%
So here we use the
density of the irrationals

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.600 align:middle line:84%
to show that this
function is not

00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:49.390 align:middle line:84%
continuous at a rational
number, and we'll

00:41:49.390 --> 00:42:01.790 align:middle line:84%
do the same thing for the case
that c is an irrational number.

00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:03.740 align:middle line:84%
It's the same
proof, except now we

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:05.120 align:middle line:90%
essentially take compliments.

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:07.860 align:middle line:90%


00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:11.130 align:middle line:84%
We proved this theorem right
after the Archimedean property

00:42:11.130 --> 00:42:13.470 align:middle line:84%
of r that for any
two real numbers,

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.940 align:middle line:84%
I can find a rational
number in between them.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:23.820 align:middle line:84%
So for every n, there exists
a rational number such

00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:31.518 align:middle line:84%
that c is less than x of n
is less in c plus 1 over n.

00:42:31.518 --> 00:42:36.990 align:middle line:90%


00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:41.710 align:middle line:84%
And again, by the
squeeze theorem,

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.050 align:middle line:84%
it follows that
xn converges to c.

00:42:44.050 --> 00:42:46.760 align:middle line:90%


00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:49.910 align:middle line:84%
And if we look at
the limit as n goes

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:53.510 align:middle line:84%
to infinity of f
of x of n, this is

00:42:53.510 --> 00:42:59.960 align:middle line:84%
equal to-- all of these
values are 1, which does not

00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.780 align:middle line:90%
equal 0, which equals f of c.

00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:06.770 align:middle line:84%
And c is assumed to be
an irrational number.

00:43:06.770 --> 00:43:11.860 align:middle line:84%
So this function
is not continuous

00:43:11.860 --> 00:43:14.750 align:middle line:90%
at every real number.

00:43:14.750 --> 00:43:17.542 align:middle line:90%
So just terminology here.

00:43:17.542 --> 00:43:19.000 align:middle line:84%
If you hear me say
this, when I say

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:26.080 align:middle line:84%
something is not continuous,
I'll often say discontinuous.

00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:29.700 align:middle line:90%


00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.200 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.575 align:middle line:84%
We're going to
use this theorem--

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:34.610 align:middle line:90%


00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.950 align:middle line:84%
I keep saying this although
I already erased it,

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:42.380 align:middle line:84%
but the theorem that
equates continuity

00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:46.970 align:middle line:84%
at a point and the fact that
every sequence converges--

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:50.990 align:middle line:84%
every sequence converging to
c implies f of xn converges

00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.710 align:middle line:90%
to f of c.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:44:03.110 align:middle line:84%
We're going to use that theorem
to get corresponding theorems

00:44:03.110 --> 00:44:06.500 align:middle line:84%
about continuity that look
analogous to statements

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.030 align:middle line:90%
we made about sequences.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:22.780 align:middle line:90%


00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.680 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll consider a
case which is not covered,

00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:30.917 align:middle line:84%
which has no analog
for sequences.

00:44:30.917 --> 00:44:32.500 align:middle line:84%
So let me state the
following theorem.

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:37.555 align:middle line:84%
So suppose s is a subset
of r, c is an element of s.

00:44:37.555 --> 00:44:40.620 align:middle line:90%


00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:48.320 align:middle line:84%
And I have two
functions from s to R.

00:44:48.320 --> 00:45:01.180 align:middle line:84%
Then if f and g are
continuous at c,

00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:08.760 align:middle line:84%
then the conclusion
is f plus g--

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:16.040 align:middle line:84%
the function f plus
g is continuous at c.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:22.770 align:middle line:90%
f times g is continuous at c.

00:45:22.770 --> 00:45:34.690 align:middle line:84%
And if g of x does not
equal 0 for all x and s,

00:45:34.690 --> 00:45:49.640 align:middle line:84%
so I can divide by it, then
f over g is continuous at c.

00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:56.210 align:middle line:90%


00:45:56.210 --> 00:45:59.570 align:middle line:84%
And so for example, I'll
prove the first statement,

00:45:59.570 --> 00:46:04.410 align:middle line:84%
the other two, you can
prove for yourself.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:06.900 align:middle line:84%
And again, this just follows
from this characterization

00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:10.100 align:middle line:84%
we have of a function being
continuous at a point in terms

00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:11.630 align:middle line:90%
of limits of sequences.

00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.030 align:middle line:84%
And limits of
sequences we know well.

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.850 align:middle line:84%
We've proven all these
properties about them.

00:46:16.850 --> 00:46:19.940 align:middle line:84%
If you like, that's where
we did all the hard work.

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:24.860 align:middle line:84%
And now getting
some payoff in that

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:29.370 align:middle line:84%
we get interesting statements
without a whole lot of work.

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:34.090 align:middle line:84%
So we're assuming f and
g are continuous at c,

00:46:34.090 --> 00:46:37.720 align:middle line:84%
so let's prove f plus
g is continuous at c

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.230 align:middle line:84%
via this sequential
characterization.

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:44.320 align:middle line:84%
Suppose xn is a sequence
converging to c.

00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:47.340 align:middle line:90%


00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:58.060 align:middle line:84%
Then since f and g
are continuous at c,

00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:01.570 align:middle line:84%
this implies that
the sequences f

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:08.170 align:middle line:84%
of x sub n converges to
f of c, and g of x sub n

00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:11.580 align:middle line:90%
converges to g of c.

00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:16.440 align:middle line:84%
And therefore, by the theorem
we proved several lectures ago

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.630 align:middle line:84%
that the sum of two
convergent sequences

00:47:18.630 --> 00:47:21.600 align:middle line:84%
converges to the
sum of the limits,

00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:28.140 align:middle line:84%
you get that f plus g of x
sub n, which is f of x sub n

00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:38.170 align:middle line:84%
plus g of x sub n, converges to
f of c plus g of c or function

00:47:38.170 --> 00:47:41.250 align:middle line:90%
f plus g evaluated at c.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:43.680 align:middle line:90%
And that's it.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.660 align:middle line:84%
We've now shown that
every sequence converging

00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:49.290 align:middle line:84%
to c, f plus g of x sub n
converges to f plus g of c.

00:47:49.290 --> 00:47:52.120 align:middle line:90%


00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.310 align:middle line:84%
And similarly for the others,
although there's maybe

00:47:54.310 --> 00:47:58.540 align:middle line:84%
a little bit of a small hiccup
here in that you want to--

00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.320 align:middle line:90%
well, no.

00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:04.110 align:middle line:90%


00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:05.565 align:middle line:90%
So this follows--

00:48:05.565 --> 00:48:06.940 align:middle line:84%
I was thinking of
something else.

00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.880 align:middle line:90%
Don't worry about that.

00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:12.270 align:middle line:84%
But 2 and 3 also
follow similarly

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:13.800 align:middle line:90%
using the sequential--

00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.360 align:middle line:90%


00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:18.910 align:middle line:84%
the analogous
sequential theorems.

00:48:18.910 --> 00:48:39.640 align:middle line:90%


00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:45.940 align:middle line:90%
However, we do have--

00:48:45.940 --> 00:48:48.340 align:middle line:84%
so these are three
natural operations

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:49.720 align:middle line:90%
we can do with two functions.

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.495 align:middle line:90%
We can add them.

00:48:50.495 --> 00:48:51.370 align:middle line:90%
We can multiply them.

00:48:51.370 --> 00:48:54.400 align:middle line:84%
We can divide them, just
like we had for sequences.

00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.920 align:middle line:84%
There is one operation
we can do with functions

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.560 align:middle line:84%
that you don't do with sequences
or can't do with sequences,

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:02.080 align:middle line:90%
and that's compose them.

00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:04.930 align:middle line:84%
So the natural question
is, is the composition

00:49:04.930 --> 00:49:07.510 align:middle line:84%
of two continuous
functions continuous?

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.510 align:middle line:90%
And the answer to that is yes.

00:49:10.510 --> 00:49:12.440 align:middle line:90%
We have to state this carefully.

00:49:12.440 --> 00:49:27.220 align:middle line:84%
So suppose a and b are a subset
of R, and c is an element of a.

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:31.410 align:middle line:90%


00:49:31.410 --> 00:49:36.770 align:middle line:84%
So let's write this a
little bit differently.

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:41.793 align:middle line:84%
Let a and b be a subset of
r. c is an element of a,

00:49:41.793 --> 00:49:45.120 align:middle line:90%
and f will be a function from--

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.613 align:middle line:90%


00:49:47.613 --> 00:49:48.530 align:middle line:90%
let me get this right.

00:49:48.530 --> 00:49:52.960 align:middle line:90%


00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:57.520 align:middle line:84%
f will be a function
from a to r,

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:02.210 align:middle line:84%
and g is a function
from a set b to a.

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.710 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:50:02.710 --> 00:50:03.960 align:middle line:90%
So I'm getting this backwards.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:09.170 align:middle line:90%


00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:12.470 align:middle line:84%
So when I compose these two,
when I take f of g, f of g

00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:16.910 align:middle line:84%
will be a function
now from b to r.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:33.730 align:middle line:84%
So if g is continuous at c and
f is continuous at the point

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:36.040 align:middle line:84%
g of c, which is,
remember, an element

00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:50.610 align:middle line:84%
of a, then the composition
f of g is continuous at c.

00:50:50.610 --> 00:50:56.850 align:middle line:90%


00:50:56.850 --> 00:50:59.490 align:middle line:84%
So we'll use, again,
this characterization

00:50:59.490 --> 00:51:03.040 align:middle line:90%
in terms of sequences.

00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:04.930 align:middle line:90%
We don't necessarily have to.

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:09.600 align:middle line:84%
We could have done it, strictly
speaking, from the definition.

00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:13.870 align:middle line:84%
But this is a nice short way
of proving this statement.

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:25.540 align:middle line:84%
So let xn be a sequence in
b, so of elements of b such

00:51:25.540 --> 00:51:28.270 align:middle line:90%
that x sub n converges to c.

00:51:28.270 --> 00:51:34.950 align:middle line:84%
And what we want to show
is that f of g limit

00:51:34.950 --> 00:51:43.840 align:middle line:84%
as n goes to infinity of f of g
of x sub n equals f of g of c.

00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.990 align:middle line:90%


00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:50.380 align:middle line:90%
Let me put this off to the side.

00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:50.880 align:middle line:90%
OK.

00:51:50.880 --> 00:52:09.200 align:middle line:84%
So since xn converges to c
and g is continuous at c,

00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:18.320 align:middle line:84%
this implies that the sequence
g of xn converges to g of c.

00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.120 align:middle line:90%
Now, g of x sub n--

00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:25.970 align:middle line:84%
this is a sequence now in a
converging to an element of a.

00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:27.140 align:middle line:90%
Yeah?

00:52:27.140 --> 00:52:35.210 align:middle line:84%
So since this sequence g of
x sub n converges to g of c

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:44.570 align:middle line:84%
and g, and now f, is
continuous at g of c,

00:52:44.570 --> 00:52:54.260 align:middle line:84%
this implies that f of g
of x sub n converges to f

00:52:54.260 --> 00:53:02.060 align:middle line:84%
of g of c, i.e., this is, by
definition, the same as saying

00:53:02.060 --> 00:53:10.610 align:middle line:84%
f of g of x sub n
equals f of g of c.

00:53:10.610 --> 00:53:16.270 align:middle line:90%


00:53:16.270 --> 00:53:20.140 align:middle line:84%
So we have an operation that
we can't do with sequences,

00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.780 align:middle line:84%
but this operation still
preserves continuity.

00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:29.080 align:middle line:84%
So taking sums of
continuous functions

00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:30.558 align:middle line:90%
maintains a continuous--

00:53:30.558 --> 00:53:32.350 align:middle line:84%
stays in the class of
continuous functions.

00:53:32.350 --> 00:53:34.810 align:middle line:84%
The product of two continuous
functions is continuous.

00:53:34.810 --> 00:53:39.590 align:middle line:90%
The quotient is continuous.

00:53:39.590 --> 00:53:45.200 align:middle line:84%
And now also the composition
of two continuous functions

00:53:45.200 --> 00:53:46.280 align:middle line:90%
is continuous.

00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:51.350 align:middle line:90%


00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:56.750 align:middle line:84%
So as a consequence of this,
we can use this to prove some--

00:53:56.750 --> 00:54:00.860 align:middle line:90%


00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:03.540 align:middle line:84%
give more examples of
functions which are continuous.

00:54:03.540 --> 00:54:12.630 align:middle line:84%
So for example, for all
n, a natural number,

00:54:12.630 --> 00:54:22.240 align:middle line:84%
f of x equals x to the n
is continuous as a function

00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:24.595 align:middle line:90%
for x and r.

00:54:24.595 --> 00:54:25.625 align:middle line:90%
So what's the proof?

00:54:25.625 --> 00:54:28.140 align:middle line:90%


00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.270 align:middle line:90%
We can do this by induction.

00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:43.355 align:middle line:84%
So for n equals 1, f of x
equals x, we've already done.

00:54:43.355 --> 00:54:47.083 align:middle line:90%


00:54:47.083 --> 00:54:48.500 align:middle line:84%
That was one of
the first examples

00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:51.230 align:middle line:84%
of continuous functions
we did, was ax plus b.

00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:56.840 align:middle line:84%
So a equals 1, b equals
0 gives me this case.

00:54:56.840 --> 00:54:58.100 align:middle line:90%
So this is the base case.

00:54:58.100 --> 00:55:01.220 align:middle line:90%
Let's now do the inductive step.

00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:06.110 align:middle line:90%


00:55:06.110 --> 00:55:12.230 align:middle line:84%
Suppose that the function
x to the m is continuous.

00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:15.950 align:middle line:84%
And now we want to show x to
the n plus 1 is continuous.

00:55:15.950 --> 00:55:18.770 align:middle line:90%


00:55:18.770 --> 00:55:26.860 align:middle line:84%
Then x to the m plus 1, this
is equal to x times x to the m.

00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:29.890 align:middle line:84%
And since x to the
m is continuous

00:55:29.890 --> 00:55:33.370 align:middle line:84%
and the function f of x
equals x is continuous,

00:55:33.370 --> 00:55:36.070 align:middle line:84%
the product of two continuous
functions is continuous.

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:47.290 align:middle line:90%


00:55:47.290 --> 00:56:01.460 align:middle line:84%
It's a product of two continuous
functions, which by the theorem

00:56:01.460 --> 00:56:10.530 align:middle line:84%
we proved implies that x to
the n plus 1 is continuous.

00:56:10.530 --> 00:56:14.170 align:middle line:84%
So I keep saying continuous,
but what I'm saying is for all c

00:56:14.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:middle line:84%
and r, x to the m
is continuous at c.

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:20.472 align:middle line:90%


00:56:20.472 --> 00:56:22.180 align:middle line:84%
So maybe I should have
written that down,

00:56:22.180 --> 00:56:26.380 align:middle line:84%
but I think that meaning
should be clear enough.

00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:33.690 align:middle line:84%
And by the same
inductive reasoning,

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:43.040 align:middle line:84%
you could also prove that in
a natural number, polynomials

00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:46.370 align:middle line:90%
are continuous. f of x--

00:56:46.370 --> 00:56:57.105 align:middle line:84%
for all in a natural
number, a0 and R,

00:56:57.105 --> 00:57:02.890 align:middle line:84%
the function given by a
polynomial a sub n x to the n

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:11.180 align:middle line:84%
plus a sub n minus 1, x to
the n minus 1 plus a sub 0

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.080 align:middle line:90%
is continuous.

00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:18.250 align:middle line:90%


00:57:18.250 --> 00:57:21.520 align:middle line:84%
So rather than write down the
actual proof by induction,

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.960 align:middle line:90%
let's talk our way through it.

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.530 align:middle line:84%
So again, for n
equals 1, this is just

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:29.620 align:middle line:84%
going to be some number times
x, which we've already dealt

00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:31.550 align:middle line:90%
with in a previous example.

00:57:31.550 --> 00:57:32.960 align:middle line:90%
So we know that's continuous.

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:35.020 align:middle line:90%
So that settles the base case.

00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:38.530 align:middle line:84%
Now let's assume that
we've proved this for n

00:57:38.530 --> 00:57:42.310 align:middle line:84%
equals m, or let's assume
this for n equals m

00:57:42.310 --> 00:57:45.820 align:middle line:84%
and look at a function
with n equals n plus 1.

00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:50.410 align:middle line:84%
That's going to be a to
the a sub m plus 1 times x

00:57:50.410 --> 00:57:53.740 align:middle line:84%
to the n plus 1 plus a
lower-order polynomial, which

00:57:53.740 --> 00:57:56.020 align:middle line:90%
we already know is continuous.

00:57:56.020 --> 00:58:00.150 align:middle line:84%
And a sub m plus
1 times x to the n

00:58:00.150 --> 00:58:02.830 align:middle line:84%
plus 1, that's
continuous because it's

00:58:02.830 --> 00:58:06.190 align:middle line:84%
the product of a constant
and a continuous function

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:07.910 align:middle line:90%
by the previous example.

00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:10.900 align:middle line:84%
So that would be continuous
plus the lower order

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.630 align:middle line:84%
polynomial, which is
continuous by assumption.

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:16.540 align:middle line:84%
That will be continuous by
the theorem that we proved.

00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:21.100 align:middle line:90%


00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:25.220 align:middle line:84%
But you don't have to
just look at polynomials.

00:58:25.220 --> 00:58:34.510 align:middle line:84%
For example-- so for
example, the function f of x

00:58:34.510 --> 00:58:41.020 align:middle line:84%
equals 1 over 3 plus
sine x to the 4th.

00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:43.060 align:middle line:90%
This is also continuous--

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:47.230 align:middle line:90%


00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:50.750 align:middle line:90%
is a continuous function.

00:58:50.750 --> 00:58:51.250 align:middle line:90%
Why?

00:58:51.250 --> 00:58:54.430 align:middle line:84%
Because for all x-- first
off, 3 plus sine x to the 4,

00:58:54.430 --> 00:58:56.140 align:middle line:90%
this is never 0.

00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.820 align:middle line:84%
So this function makes
perfectly good sense.

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.440 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom is
always non-zero.

00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:06.790 align:middle line:84%
Sine x is continuous, so sine
x to the 4 is continuous.

00:59:06.790 --> 00:59:08.475 align:middle line:90%
3 is a continuous function.

00:59:08.475 --> 00:59:09.350 align:middle line:90%
It's just a constant.

00:59:09.350 --> 00:59:15.640 align:middle line:84%
So the bottom as a function
on its own is continuous.

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:18.370 align:middle line:84%
And 1 over that
function is continuous

00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:22.570 align:middle line:84%
as long as the bottom is
never 0, which it's never 0,

00:59:22.570 --> 00:59:26.270 align:middle line:90%
so again, by this theorem here.

00:59:26.270 --> 00:59:29.500 align:middle line:84%
So we used the composition one
to say that sine x to the 4

00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.150 align:middle line:90%
is continuous.

00:59:31.150 --> 00:59:34.120 align:middle line:84%
And we use that one,
the theorem before that,

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.390 align:middle line:84%
to show that 1 over 3 plus
sine x 4 is continuous.

00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:39.310 align:middle line:84%
So let me write
this out real quick.

00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:44.530 align:middle line:90%


00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:47.680 align:middle line:84%
I will say by
composition theorem,

00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:56.060 align:middle line:84%
the function sine x
of 4 is continuous,

00:59:56.060 --> 01:00:00.310 align:middle line:84%
which implies by, I'll
say, algebraic theorem,

01:00:00.310 --> 01:00:07.350 align:middle line:84%
meaning that theorem that
involves algebraic operations,

01:00:07.350 --> 01:00:15.580 align:middle line:84%
3 plus sine x to
the 4 is continuous.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:22.260 align:middle line:84%
And by the algebraic
theorem again,

01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:32.520 align:middle line:84%
since 3 plus sine x to the 4
is never 0 for all x and r,

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.540 align:middle line:90%
this is continuous.

01:00:33.540 --> 01:00:37.640 align:middle line:90%


01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:39.110 align:middle line:90%
All right.

01:00:39.110 --> 01:00:41.390 align:middle line:84%
So next time, we'll
look at some properties

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:53.450 align:middle line:84%
of continuous functions, namely
called the min and max theorems

01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:54.515 align:middle line:90%
for continuous functions.

01:00:54.515 --> 01:00:56.390 align:middle line:84%
So the great thing about
continuous functions

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:59.090 align:middle line:84%
is if you look at them on
closed and bounded intervals,

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:02.720 align:middle line:84%
they always attain a maximum
and minimum at some point--

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:09.660 align:middle line:84%
not just that the graph
is bounded above or below,

01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:12.840 align:middle line:84%
but there's actual point
where f reaches that min

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.010 align:middle line:90%
and reaches that max.

01:01:14.010 --> 01:01:17.460 align:middle line:84%
And then we'll also prove the
intermediate value theorem,

01:01:17.460 --> 01:01:18.750 align:middle line:90%
which says between any two--

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:22.090 align:middle line:90%


01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:26.470 align:middle line:84%
if I have a continuous
function on an interval a, b,

01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:29.590 align:middle line:84%
and I look at f of a and f
of b, and I take a number

01:01:29.590 --> 01:01:32.620 align:middle line:84%
in between those two
values, f of a and f of b,

01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:34.490 align:middle line:84%
there exists a point
in between them

01:01:34.490 --> 01:01:38.740 align:middle line:90%
so that f attains that value.

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:42.240 align:middle line:90%
And this is extremely important.

01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:45.090 align:middle line:90%


01:01:45.090 --> 01:01:47.700 align:middle line:84%
And we'll definitely
see why later once we

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:52.310 align:middle line:84%
get to differentiability
and continuity.

01:01:52.310 --> 01:01:58.000 align:middle line:90%

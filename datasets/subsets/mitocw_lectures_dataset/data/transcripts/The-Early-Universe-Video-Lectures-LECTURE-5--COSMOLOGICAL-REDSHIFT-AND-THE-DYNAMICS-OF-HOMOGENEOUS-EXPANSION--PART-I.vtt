00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:24.060
PROFESSOR: OK if there
are no questions,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.430
we will get back to physics.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.240
What I want to do today, as
it suggests on the slide,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.855
is to finish the kinematics
of homogeneous expansion

00:00:36.855 --> 00:00:38.905
that we were talking
about last time.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:42.176
And the one topic in that
category that we have not

00:00:42.176 --> 00:00:44.496
discussed yet is the
cosmological redshift

00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:46.910
So we'll begin by
going over that.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.670
And then we'll begin to go on
to the next topic altogether,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.645
which is the dynamics of
homogeneous expansion --

00:00:53.645 --> 00:00:57.573
how do we understand how
gravity affects the expansion

00:00:57.573 --> 00:00:58.555
of the universe?

00:00:58.555 --> 00:01:01.712
So that will be the main
subject of today's lecture,

00:01:01.712 --> 00:01:06.457
once we've finished up the issue
of the cosmological redshift

00:01:06.457 --> 00:01:07.680
shift.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.292
Let me remind you that at
end of the last lecture,

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:14.274
we were talking about the
synchronization of clocks,

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.262
and the coordinate
system that we'll

00:01:16.262 --> 00:01:18.910
be using to describe the
homogeneously expanding

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.150
model of the universe.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.980
Remember, we are introducing
spatial coordinates

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.853
that grow with the
universe, so that we're

00:01:28.853 --> 00:01:31.436
going to be assuming the fact,
literally, that the universe is

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:33.186
perfectly homogeneous
and isotropic, which

00:01:33.186 --> 00:01:35.864
means that all objects will
be literally addressed,

00:01:35.864 --> 00:01:37.833
relative to this
coordinate system.

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:40.240
If we're talking about
the real universe,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.646
then there would be
some motion relative

00:01:42.646 --> 00:01:45.940
to this coordinate system,
because the universe is not

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.513
exactly homogeneous.

00:01:47.513 --> 00:01:50.013
But we're going to be working
for now with the approximation

00:01:50.013 --> 00:01:52.713
that our model universe is
exactly homogeneous, which

00:01:52.713 --> 00:01:54.432
means that all
matter is completely

00:01:54.432 --> 00:01:58.730
at rest, relative to this
expanding coordinate system.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.771
And now we want to talk
about how to define time,

00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:02.437
or to review what we
said last time when

00:02:02.437 --> 00:02:04.590
we talked about
how to define time.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.625
What we will imagine is that in
every location in the universe

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:11.070
at rest, relative to
the matter, is a clock.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.835
And each clock ticks off
time, and all those clocks

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:19.144
will be acceptable
as a clock which

00:02:19.144 --> 00:02:22.976
measures the time at
relevant positions-- time

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:25.210
is measured locally--
but we still

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:27.780
have to talk about
synchronizing those clocks.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.440
And what we said last time
is that we can synchronize

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.836
the clocks as long as there's
some cosmic phenomena that

00:02:33.836 --> 00:02:37.098
can be seen everywhere, which
has some time evolution.

00:02:37.098 --> 00:02:40.237
And we gave two examples-- one
is the evolution of the Hubble

00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:43.510
expansion rate, which
can be measured locally,

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.795
and everybody can agree to set
their clocks to midnight when

00:02:47.795 --> 00:02:51.530
the Hubble expansion
rate has a certain value.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.347
And another cosmic
variable is the temperature

00:02:55.347 --> 00:02:58.784
of the cosmic microwave
background radiation.

00:02:58.784 --> 00:03:01.239
So, everybody in
this model universe

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.185
will agree that we'll set
the clocks to midnight when

00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:06.640
the temperature of the
cosmic background radiation

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.570
goes to 5 degrees, or
any specified number.

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.060
So as long as there's a
phenomena of that sort, which

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.670
there is in our universe,
it's possible to synchronize

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.349
these clocks in a unique way.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.765
And the important
thing to realize

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:22.018
is that once they're
synchronized at one time,

00:03:22.018 --> 00:03:24.463
they will remain
synchronized as a consequence

00:03:24.463 --> 00:03:27.397
of our assumption
of homogeneity.

00:03:27.397 --> 00:03:30.331
That is, if everybody agrees
that the cosmic background

00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:33.620
radiation has a temperature
of 10 degrees at midnight,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.130
if everybody waits for 15
minutes after midnight,

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.390
everybody should see the
same fall in temperature

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.670
during that time
interval, otherwise

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.736
it would be a violation
of this hypothesis

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:46.668
of perfect homogeneity.

00:03:46.668 --> 00:03:48.117
Yes, question.

00:03:48.117 --> 00:03:51.015
AUDIENCE: Is it verified
that temperature

00:03:51.015 --> 00:03:55.879
is invariant for all observers--
all Lorentz observers?

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.170
PROFESSOR: OK the question
is, is temperature invariant

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.325
for all observers?

00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:04.020
And the question even included
all Lorentz observers.

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.497
It's not really invariant to
different Lorentz observers.

00:04:07.497 --> 00:04:10.163
We're talking about a privileged
class of observers, all of whom

00:04:10.163 --> 00:04:12.570
are at rest, relative
to the average matter.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.950
If you move through the
cosmic background radiation,

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:18.249
then you don't see uniform
thermal distribution any more.

00:04:18.249 --> 00:04:20.209
Rather what you see
is radiation that's

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.066
hotter in the forward
direction and colder

00:04:22.066 --> 00:04:23.149
in the backward direction.

00:04:23.149 --> 00:04:25.599
And we in fact, as I think
I have mentioned here,

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:28.049
see that effect in
our real universe.

00:04:28.049 --> 00:04:31.390
We're apparently moving relative
to the cosmic background

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.678
radiation, at about 1/1000th
of the speed of light.

00:04:35.678 --> 00:04:40.929
So it's not invariant
with respect to motion.

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:42.720
There's the additional
question, though is,

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.240
is it the same everywhere
in the visible universe?

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:48.650
As far as we can tell, it is.

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.750
There is some direct measurement
of that, that we'll probably

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.310
talk about later in
the course, by looking

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.350
at certain spectral lines
in distant galaxies.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.724
One can effectively
measure the temperature

00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:01.140
of the cosmic
microwave background

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.442
radiation in some
distant galaxies.

00:05:03.442 --> 00:05:05.150
This line cannot be
seen in all galaxies,

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.027
and the extent that it's
been measured in degrees.

00:05:09.027 --> 00:05:10.610
So certainly in our
model, we're going

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.720
to assume complete homogeneity,
so everything's the same

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:15.515
everywhere, and there is strong
evidence for that homogeneity.

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:17.530
Although it's not
exact, but there's

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.040
strong evidence for
approximate homogeneity

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.438
in the real universe.

00:05:22.438 --> 00:05:22.938
Yes?

00:05:22.938 --> 00:05:24.399
AUDIENCE: If you were really
close to the black hole

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.899
[INAUDIBLE].

00:05:34.847 --> 00:05:35.430
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.820
The question is, suppose we're
a little bit more careful,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.210
and talk about the fact that
some people might be living

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:42.980
near black holes, and
other people are not.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.080
Will that affect the
synchronization of clocks

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.100
for the people who are
living near black holes?

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.580
The answer is sure, it will.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.410
We can only synchronize
clocks cosmically

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.825
if we assume that the universe
is absolutely homogeneous.

00:05:56.825 --> 00:05:58.740
As soon as you introduce
inhomogeneities

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.530
like black holes, or even
just stars like the sun,

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.250
they create small
perturbations, which

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.450
then make it really
impossible to expect clocks

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.160
to stay in sync with each other.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:11.510
So as soon as you have
concentrations of mass,

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.810
then the fact that what
we're talking about now

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.220
is an approximation
becomes real.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.569
But those deviations are small.

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:20.985
The deviations
coming from the sun

00:06:20.985 --> 00:06:24.660
are only on the order of
a part in a million or so.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.310
So, to a very good
approximation,

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.970
the universe obeys
what we're describing,

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:34.004
although if you went very
close to the surface of one

00:06:34.004 --> 00:06:35.420
of these super-massive
black holes

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:37.290
in the centers of
galaxies, or something,

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.070
you would in fact
find they had a very

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.082
significant effect
on your clocks.

00:06:42.082 --> 00:06:42.915
Any other questions?

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.290
OK.

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.270
Let me move on now.

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:51.760
The next topic, as
I have warned you,

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:54.063
is the cosmological redshift.

00:06:54.063 --> 00:06:59.899
Now in the first lecture
beyond the overview,

00:06:59.899 --> 00:07:02.190
which I guess was a combination
of the second and third

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.730
lectures in the course, we
talked about the Doppler shift

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:08.720
for sound waves, and we talked
about the relativistic Doppler

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:10.990
shift for light
waves-- that was all

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:13.680
in the context of
special relativity.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.470
Now what we're going
to face is the fact

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:18.510
that cosmology is not
really governed entirely

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:22.700
by special relativity, although
special relativity still

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.365
holds locally in our cosmology.

00:07:26.365 --> 00:07:29.480
But special relativity does not
include the effects of gravity,

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.440
and on a global scale,
the effects of gravity

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.660
are very important
for cosmology,

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.410
and therefore special
relativity by itself

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:41.290
is not enough to understand
many properties of the universe,

00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.026
including the
cosmological redshift.

00:07:44.026 --> 00:07:45.400
It turns out
though, that there's

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.525
a way of describing the
cosmological redshift which

00:07:47.525 --> 00:07:50.030
will make it sound even simpler
than special relativity.

00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:51.680
And I'll describe
that first, and then

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.138
afterwards, we'll
talk a little bit

00:07:53.138 --> 00:07:58.210
about how this very
simple-looking derivation jives

00:07:58.210 --> 00:08:01.160
with the special relativity
derivation, which must also

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:04.730
be correct, at least locally.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:05.620
OK.

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:13.040
So, the question we
want to ask ourselves,

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:16.660
is suppose we look
at a distant galaxy,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:19.820
and light is emitted
from that galaxy.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.010
How will the frequency
of that light

00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:26.830
shift between the frequency
it had when it was emitted,

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:28.500
and the frequency
that we would measure

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.690
as we received the light.

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:37.039
So to draw the situation on
the blackboard, let's introduce

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.450
a coordinate system, x.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:41.515
And this will be our
comoving coordinate system.

00:08:41.515 --> 00:08:44.340
X is measured in notches.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:51.860
We'll put ourselves at
the origin-- there is us.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:55.100
And we'll put our
galaxy out here

00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:02.470
someplace-- there is the
distant galaxy that we

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.880
will be observing.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.240
They galaxy will be at some
particular coordinate, which

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:13.600
I will call l sub c, c
for coordinate distance,

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:18.210
so l sub c is the coordinate
distance to the galaxy.

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:21.930
And then the physical
distance-- is

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:25.010
what we've been calling
l sub p, p for physical,

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:29.330
which depends on time, because
there's Hubble expansion.

00:09:29.330 --> 00:09:34.255
So l sub p of t, as we've said
a number of times already,

00:09:34.255 --> 00:09:38.810
is a of t times l sub c.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:41.690
The scale factor, which
depends on time, times

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:44.520
the coordinate distance,
which does not depend on time.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:49.960
So everything just expands
with the scale factor a of t.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:56.950
So this describes the
situation, and now

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.830
what we want to
ask ourselves, is

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.860
suppose a wave is being
emitted by the galaxy--

00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.800
and we'll be trying to track
the distance between wave

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.800
crests, which determines
what the wavelength is.

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.220
Since we'll only be
interested in wave crests,

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.270
we will talk in
language where we just

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:19.885
imagine there's a
pulse at each crest,

00:10:19.885 --> 00:10:21.343
and what happens
in between doesn't

00:10:21.343 --> 00:10:23.710
matter for what
we're talking about.

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:32.210
So we want to track successive
pulses emitted by the galaxy.

00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:37.330
Now the important
feature of our system

00:10:37.330 --> 00:10:40.650
is that we have
argued that we know

00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:47.160
how to track light waves through
this kind of coordinate system.

00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.940
If x is our cosmic coordinate,
dx dt, the coordinate velocity

00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.900
of light, is just equal to the
ordinary velocity of light,

00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:03.210
c, but rescaled by
the scale factor.

00:11:03.210 --> 00:11:04.890
And the scale factor
here is playing

00:11:04.890 --> 00:11:07.660
the role of converting
meters to notches.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:10.370
So c is measured in
meters per second.

00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:12.570
By dividing by a of
t, we get the speed

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:14.840
in notches per second,
which is what we want,

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:18.045
because x is measured, not
in meters, but in notches.

00:11:18.045 --> 00:11:21.870
A notch being the arbitrary
coordinate-- the arbitrary unit

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:26.180
that we adopt to describe our
comoving coordinate system.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.600
Now the important
feature of this equation,

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.010
for our current purpose, is that
the speed of light, as we're

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:38.300
going to follow
these light pulses

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.480
through our coordinate
system, depends on time,

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.140
but it does not depend on x.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:49.280
Our universe is homogeneous,
so all points x are the same.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:53.140
So two pulses will travel at
the same speed at the same time,

00:11:53.140 --> 00:11:55.540
no matter where they are.

00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:58.350
And that's all we really
need, to understand

00:11:58.350 --> 00:12:02.680
the fact that if one
pulse leaves our galaxy

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.868
and is coming towards
us-- I should do that

00:12:04.868 --> 00:12:07.076
with my right hand, because
the second pulse is going

00:12:07.076 --> 00:12:11.280
to be my other hand-- as
that second pulse follows it,

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.347
the second pulse,
at any given time--

00:12:13.347 --> 00:12:15.180
even though the speed
will change with time,

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.650
but at any given
time-- the second pulse

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.310
will be traveling at the same
speed as the first pulse.

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:25.050
And that means that it'll
look something like this.

00:12:25.050 --> 00:12:26.541
The speed might
change with time,

00:12:26.541 --> 00:12:28.915
but as long as they both travel
at exactly the same speed

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:32.150
at any given time, they will
stay exactly the same distance

00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:35.440
apart in our comoving
coordinate system.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.080
Delta x, the x distance
between the two pulses,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.040
will not change with time.

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:44.600
And if the coordinate distance
does not change with time--

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.400
the physical distance is
always the scale factor

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.440
times the coordinate
distance-- it

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.120
means that the physical
wavelength of the light pulse

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:54.820
will simply be stretched
with the scale factor, which

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:57.500
means you'll be stretched with
the expansion of the universe,

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:01.230
in exactly the same way as any
other distance in this model

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:04.990
universe will be stretched
as the universe expands.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.300
So that's the key idea,
and it's very simple,

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.435
and those words
really say it all.

00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:23.990
Delta x equals constant
implies delta l

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:31.770
physical is
proportional to a of t,

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:37.240
and that implies that the
wavelength of the light,

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:40.890
as a function of t, is
proportional to a of t.

00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.630
Wavelength is actually what I
was calling delta l physical,

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:48.771
the distance between
these two pulses,

00:13:48.771 --> 00:13:51.870
where each pulse represents
a crest of the wave.

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.310
And lambda is the standard
letter of the wavelength.

00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.380
Now the wavelength is related
to the period of a wave

00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.580
simply by the
relationship that lambda

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:32.770
is equal to c times delta t.

00:14:32.770 --> 00:14:37.490
Wavelength is just the distance
the wave travels in one period.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:40.480
So if lambda is
proportional to a of t,

00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.360
so is the time interval, delta
t, the period of the wave,

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.610
going to be
proportional to delta t.

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:48.480
So we have been
defining the redshift

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:50.500
in terms of the period.

00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:59.800
So delta t observed over
delta t at the source

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:11.355
is equal to lambda observed
over lambda at the source.

00:15:14.869 --> 00:15:18.680
Lambda and delta t are
proportional to each other.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.650
And-- let me finish and
I'll get to you, OK?

00:15:20.650 --> 00:15:21.400
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.850
PROFESSOR: This then,
the ratio of the lengths,

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:25.350
is just the amount
by which universe

00:15:25.350 --> 00:15:27.590
has stretched over that time.

00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:30.720
So just the ratio of the scale
factors at the two times.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:35.330
So this is equal to just a of
the time of observation, which

00:15:35.330 --> 00:15:41.785
I'll call t sub o, over a of
the time of the source, t sub s.

00:15:44.998 --> 00:15:54.590
So this is the scale
factor at source,

00:15:54.590 --> 00:16:04.175
and the numerator here is the
scale factor at observation.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.710
And this ratio of times,
or ratio of wavelengths,

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:15.350
or ratio of scale factors,
is defined to be 1 plus z,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.620
as we have always done.

00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.130
The ratio of the time intervals
we had defined originally

00:16:19.130 --> 00:16:21.920
as 1 plus z, we'll
keep that definition,

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.909
and that defines the
redshift shift, z.

00:16:24.909 --> 00:16:25.450
Question now?

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:26.436
Yes.

00:16:26.436 --> 00:16:28.420
AUDIENCE: Is that
definition of lambda,

00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:31.396
does that have anything to do
with the Lorentz invariant?

00:16:31.396 --> 00:16:34.662
Like, it just kind of
struck me as the first term?

00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.680
PROFESSOR: Not
sure what you mean?

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.770
What-- Lorentz invariant what?

00:16:42.770 --> 00:16:46.410
AUDIENCE: Like the c delta
tau squared equals c delta t--

00:16:46.410 --> 00:16:49.270
PROFESSOR: Oh.

00:16:49.270 --> 00:16:52.490
Well, the delta t could
be put into that formula,

00:16:52.490 --> 00:16:54.897
but that's formula could
measure any delta t.

00:16:54.897 --> 00:16:55.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.590
PROFESSOR: So of course
Lorentz is a special case,

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:00.450
but any delta t would be a
special case of that formula,

00:17:00.450 --> 00:17:02.220
so I don't think
there's a lot to say

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:03.973
about it being a special case.

00:17:03.973 --> 00:17:06.140
AUDIENCE: All right, cool.

00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.720
PROFESSOR: Any other questions?

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:08.220
Yes?

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.178
AUDIENCE: Is this like
fundamentally different?

00:17:10.178 --> 00:17:11.497
Or is it similar [INAUDIBLE]?

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:20.190
PROFESSOR: [INAUDIBLE] I
was going to come to that.

00:17:20.190 --> 00:17:23.810
That's the question of how the
cosmological redshift relates

00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:26.369
to the special
relativity redshift

00:17:26.369 --> 00:17:30.051
that we derived earlier, and
I'm coming to that immediately.

00:17:30.051 --> 00:17:32.640
Good question,
we're getting there.

00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:35.952
Any other questions,
though, before I go there?

00:17:35.952 --> 00:17:40.415
In my point of view,
that's the next topic.

00:17:40.415 --> 00:17:40.914
OK.

00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:45.930
OK, so let me move on to
exactly that question.

00:17:45.930 --> 00:17:47.570
How does this relate
to what we already

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:50.075
said about the redshift?

00:17:57.570 --> 00:18:00.420
This answer-- I would like
to quantify things and say

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.481
that it differs in two
ways from the calculation

00:18:02.481 --> 00:18:03.605
that we've done previously.

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.330
And the first is-- the
reason why it's important

00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:37.750
to us-- is that this actually
takes into account, effects

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.050
which were not taken into
account by our earlier

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:41.430
calculation.

00:18:41.430 --> 00:18:43.520
In particular, even
though we derived this

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:47.920
by a very simple
kinematic argument, which

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.890
didn't seem to involve
much math at all,

00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:53.430
it actually is
incredibly strong,

00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:59.610
in that it encompasses not only
special relativity, but also

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.680
general relativity.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.609
It includes all the
effects of gravity.

00:19:02.609 --> 00:19:04.150
If you think about
what gravity might

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:06.750
do to what we're
talking about, gravity

00:19:06.750 --> 00:19:10.320
doesn't change the fact
that the speed of light

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.135
is going to be c over a of t.

00:19:12.135 --> 00:19:14.450
That really is just
a unit conversion,

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:16.790
combined with the fundamental
physics assumption

00:19:16.790 --> 00:19:18.165
that the speed of
light is always

00:19:18.165 --> 00:19:22.480
measured at c, relative
to any observer.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.210
So when we put in
gravity, this relationship

00:19:25.210 --> 00:19:26.780
continues to hold--
that was really

00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:29.329
all we used to drive
this-- so gravity is not

00:19:29.329 --> 00:19:30.792
going to affect the answer.

00:19:30.792 --> 00:19:32.945
If you think about
special relativity,

00:19:32.945 --> 00:19:34.460
is there something left out?

00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.153
Everything I said
here, Newton would

00:19:36.153 --> 00:19:37.236
have understood perfectly.

00:19:37.236 --> 00:19:39.111
I didn't have to mention
time dilation, which

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:42.490
was crucial to our special
relativity calculation

00:19:42.490 --> 00:19:43.841
of the redshift shift.

00:19:43.841 --> 00:19:44.715
Did I make a mistake?

00:19:44.715 --> 00:19:48.760
Is there some place where time
dilation should come in here?

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.140
The answer, really, is
no, if you think about it.

00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:54.555
We had two clocks
involved in our system,

00:19:54.555 --> 00:19:59.850
a clock on the galaxy,
and a clock at us,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.020
which we used to measure
the period of emission,

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:08.500
and the period of reception, but
those clocks are each at rest,

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.300
relative to matter
in the region--

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.760
even though they're moving
with respect to each other--

00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:18.552
so by definition, they
do measure cosmic time.

00:20:18.552 --> 00:20:20.385
Cosmic time is a very
peculiar kind of time,

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.120
it's not the time in
any inertial frame.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.260
These clocks are moving
with respect to each other,

00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:27.434
so if you were defining
inertial frame time,

00:20:27.434 --> 00:20:29.100
their clocks could
never be synchronized

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.950
and would never agree
with each other.

00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:34.800
But in this concept
of cosmic time,

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.100
they do agree with each
other, by construction.

00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:42.170
And since each clock is at rest,
relative to its local matter,

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.450
it measures this t that
we're talking about,

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:47.180
this cosmic time variable.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:51.970
And when the pulse
arrives at us,

00:20:51.970 --> 00:20:55.486
when we measure
delta t on our clock,

00:20:55.486 --> 00:20:57.360
that's exactly the
quantity that, in the end,

00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.642
we want to talk about--
delta t sub observer.

00:21:00.642 --> 00:21:02.380
The quantity measured
on our clock,

00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:05.450
which is a clock which
also measures cosmic time.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.784
So there's no place for
any time dilation to enter.

00:21:07.784 --> 00:21:10.000
It's not that we forgot
it, it's not there.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.320
It's not part of
this calculation.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:15.200
So this result, as
simple as it looks,

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:17.190
actually fully
encompasses the effects

00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:20.490
of both special
relativity and gravity.

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:22.470
Now let me just mention,
it's not obvious

00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:23.600
how gravity came in here.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.960
I'm telling you it
satisfies-- includes

00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.260
all the effects of gravity.

00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:29.580
Where is gravity hidden?

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:32.160
Let me throw that
out as a question.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:34.450
How does gravity affect
this calculation,

00:21:34.450 --> 00:21:37.210
even though I didn't
have to mention gravity

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:38.971
when I described
the calculation?

00:21:38.971 --> 00:21:40.294
Yeah, in back.

00:21:40.294 --> 00:21:41.620
AUDIENCE: The scale factor?

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:42.570
PROFESSOR: That's
right, the scale factor.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.090
We have not yet talked
about how a of t evolves.

00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.880
And the evolution of the
a of t will explicitly

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.640
involve the effects of gravity.

00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.405
And that's why this
result depends on gravity,

00:21:52.405 --> 00:21:56.210
even though we didn't
need to use gravity,

00:21:56.210 --> 00:22:00.030
or say anything about
gravity to get the results.

00:22:00.030 --> 00:22:03.200
So this is the first difference.

00:22:03.200 --> 00:22:13.690
This calculation includes
the effect of gravity.

00:22:22.867 --> 00:22:24.960
Which is through a of t.

00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.380
Now, because this calculation
seems to include everything

00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:36.400
that the first calculation
included and more,

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.899
you'd expect to be
more complicated,

00:22:37.899 --> 00:22:40.382
but it's less complicated.

00:22:40.382 --> 00:22:41.840
Could we have saved
ourselves a lot

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.923
of time last week by just
giving this calculation,

00:22:43.923 --> 00:22:46.105
and deriving the
other answer from it.

00:22:46.105 --> 00:22:49.940
The answer is, not easily,
it would not have saved time,

00:22:49.940 --> 00:22:51.607
one can't, in principle,
do it that way.

00:22:51.607 --> 00:22:53.023
But the other
important difference

00:22:53.023 --> 00:22:55.110
between these two
calculations is the variables

00:22:55.110 --> 00:22:57.930
that you're using to
express your answer.

00:22:57.930 --> 00:23:01.369
Once you ask a question, if
you ask the question vaguely,

00:23:01.369 --> 00:23:03.660
there could be many different
answers to that question,

00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:08.120
depending on what variables
are used to express the answer.

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:22.300
So what we're doing here is
we're expressing the redshift z

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:29.000
for objects which are in fact at
rest in the comoving coordinate

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:29.500
system.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:56.715
The special relativity
calculation-- I think I'm

00:23:56.715 --> 00:23:58.090
going to need
another blackboard.

00:24:02.730 --> 00:24:17.240
The special relativity
calculation, on the other hand

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:32.300
gives z as a function
of the velocity,

00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:37.070
as measured in an inertial
coordinate system.

00:24:46.316 --> 00:24:47.940
So the answers are
just being expressed

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:50.010
in terms of totally
different things,

00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.969
and the answer is so
simple here because a of t

00:24:51.969 --> 00:24:53.718
already incorporates
a lot of information,

00:24:53.718 --> 00:24:55.410
and we've just taken
advantage of that

00:24:55.410 --> 00:24:58.694
to be able to give a very simple
answer in terms of a of t,

00:24:58.694 --> 00:25:02.520
without yet saying how we're
going to calculate a of t.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.426
Yes.

00:25:03.426 --> 00:25:05.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
two questions.

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.394
One is about that constant time.

00:25:07.394 --> 00:25:08.386
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:25:08.386 --> 00:25:12.354
AUDIENCE: How is that different
than the Newton or Galilean

00:25:12.354 --> 00:25:15.330
idea of absolute time?

00:25:15.330 --> 00:25:16.110
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:25:16.110 --> 00:25:20.020
The question was how does
the notion of cosmic time

00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.420
differ from Newton's
or Galileo's

00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.940
notion of absolute time?

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.040
And the answer is
perhaps not much.

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.230
Operationally, I think it
is pretty much the same,

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:39.865
but the real point is that
Newton and Galileo did not

00:25:39.865 --> 00:25:43.159
know anything about relative
effects like time dilation.

00:25:43.159 --> 00:25:45.325
So for them, it was just
obvious that all clocks ran

00:25:45.325 --> 00:25:48.350
at the same speed,
and time was naturally

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:51.319
universal-- naturally absolute.

00:25:51.319 --> 00:25:52.860
In this case, we're
aware of the fact

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.300
that moving clocks run
at different speeds.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.705
So if we were to take
these clocks between us

00:25:58.705 --> 00:26:00.930
and the galaxy, and
transport one to the other,

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.500
depending on what path we
used to transport them on,

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.650
in the end, they would probably
not agree with each other.

00:26:06.650 --> 00:26:09.334
So, we're setting
up a definition

00:26:09.334 --> 00:26:13.860
of what we're going to define
locally as time, recognizing

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:17.770
that what time means here,
versus what time means there,

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.260
is a consequence of our
assumptions about how we define

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:20.760
things.

00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:22.800
It is not given
automatically by the fact

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.686
that all clocks will
run at the same speed.

00:26:27.610 --> 00:26:28.224
Follow up?

00:26:28.224 --> 00:26:28.849
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:28.849 --> 00:26:30.845
An addition, this is
slightly different.

00:26:30.845 --> 00:26:32.841
So, in the special
relativity calculations,

00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:36.416
[INAUDIBLE] z could
be [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:36.416 --> 00:26:37.332
PROFESSOR: Absolutely.

00:26:37.332 --> 00:26:39.827
AUDIENCE: So here we're
only seeing a red shift,

00:26:39.827 --> 00:26:43.819
but we would obtain a blue
shift if we allowed a of t

00:26:43.819 --> 00:26:44.840
to be decreasing, right?

00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:45.840
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:47.719
If the universe contracted,
we would get a blue shift.

00:26:47.719 --> 00:26:48.594
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:52.580
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:55.127
It would correspond to the
special relativity case.

00:26:55.127 --> 00:26:57.460
I was going to say a few words
about the correspondence,

00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.100
but I'll answer questions first.

00:26:59.100 --> 00:26:59.647
Yes.

00:26:59.647 --> 00:27:01.147
AUDIENCE: I'd kind
of like to add on

00:27:01.147 --> 00:27:04.550
to that question
regarding the causal time.

00:27:04.550 --> 00:27:05.230
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:06.730
AUDIENCE: Isn't the
fact that you've

00:27:06.730 --> 00:27:08.405
scaled the speed
of light, that's

00:27:08.405 --> 00:27:12.160
what takes care of this
discrepancy between the clocks

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.064
themselves?

00:27:14.064 --> 00:27:16.230
PROFESSOR: The question is,
does the fact that we've

00:27:16.230 --> 00:27:18.400
rescaled the speed
of light take care

00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.610
of the discrepancy of times?

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.840
Well, partially, but
it doesn't say anything

00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.410
about what moving
clocks will do.

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:27.410
If you had a clock moving
through this universe,

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:31.660
you would have to calculate a
time dilation for that clock,

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:32.990
just as in any other case.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.406
AUDIENCE: What about the two
end points, say, of the path.

00:27:35.406 --> 00:27:39.310
Is that why you're scaling
the speed of light?

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.972
PROFESSOR: Not really.

00:27:40.972 --> 00:27:43.080
The scaling of
the speed of light

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.120
really comes about through
the scaling of space.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.830
This in fact is just the scale
factor that we scale space.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.950
Time is measured
locally on every clock,

00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:53.652
and we don't think of
it as being rescaled.

00:27:53.652 --> 00:27:55.110
The speed of light
looks different,

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.740
simply because a notch
is changing with time.

00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.883
And that formula tells you how
to convert meters per second,

00:28:00.883 --> 00:28:03.470
which will always be the
same to the speed of light,

00:28:03.470 --> 00:28:05.220
to notches per second,
which will change

00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:06.613
as the size of a notch changes

00:28:06.613 --> 00:28:07.488
AUDIENCE: Right,yeah.

00:28:07.488 --> 00:28:07.988
OK.

00:28:07.988 --> 00:28:09.484
I understand.

00:28:09.484 --> 00:28:10.645
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:28:10.645 --> 00:28:12.478
AUDIENCE: Further in
the line of questioning

00:28:12.478 --> 00:28:14.973
about cosmological
time-- so we expect

00:28:14.973 --> 00:28:17.468
that us and that
other galaxy have

00:28:17.468 --> 00:28:20.961
simultaneous clocks
relative to the cosmic time,

00:28:20.961 --> 00:28:23.955
and also we expect our own
clocks to be simultaneous

00:28:23.955 --> 00:28:25.951
with our cosmological
clocks, I assume.

00:28:25.951 --> 00:28:28.032
So if we-- Is that true?

00:28:28.032 --> 00:28:29.240
PROFESSOR: That's right, yes.

00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.110
Our own clock is just
an example of one

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:33.230
of the clocks sitting
on the place called us,

00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:36.550
and all clocks sitting on that
place will behave the same way.

00:28:36.550 --> 00:28:40.920
And they define the local
definition of cosmic time.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:43.370
AUDIENCE: So if we take those
clocks and move very slowly

00:28:43.370 --> 00:28:47.780
across to the other galaxy,
in cosmological-- in comoving

00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:50.720
coordinates, we wouldn't expect
there to be any time dilation,

00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.640
in the respect that
clocks stay simultaneous.

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.686
Safe to say, that
we would think it

00:28:56.686 --> 00:28:58.560
would be simultaneous
with us the whole time,

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:00.030
until we got to
the other galaxy.

00:29:00.030 --> 00:29:02.030
And then it would
still be simultaneous.

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:04.496
But, they're moving at
a speed relative to us,

00:29:04.496 --> 00:29:07.372
so we wouldn't
expect [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:07.372 --> 00:29:08.080
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:08.210
OK.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:09.659
You raise a good
question, which I

00:29:09.659 --> 00:29:11.200
would have to think
about the answer.

00:29:11.200 --> 00:29:13.760
If we brought-- if we
carried our clock very slowly

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:17.810
to this galaxy, and the
limit was infinitely slow,

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:19.400
would it agree
when it got there?

00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.035
Let me think about that,
and answer it next time.

00:29:22.035 --> 00:29:23.430
I'm not altogether sure.

00:29:26.912 --> 00:29:27.745
Any other questions?

00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:31.560
OK.

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.476
I want to say something
about the relationship

00:29:33.476 --> 00:29:36.239
between these two calculations.

00:29:36.239 --> 00:29:38.280
What would happen if we
tried to actually compare

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.730
the answers that we got for
the relativistic Doppler shift,

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:46.960
and for this answer, for
the cosmological redshift.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.887
There's really
only one case where

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:52.930
it would be legitimate
to compare them.

00:29:52.930 --> 00:29:54.580
Since the calculation
we just did

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:56.640
was supposed to include
the effects of gravity,

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:58.435
and special relativity
calculation does not

00:29:58.435 --> 00:30:01.400
include the effects of
gravity, the only way

00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:03.950
we should be able to compare
them, and see that they agree,

00:30:03.950 --> 00:30:07.290
would be the case where
gravity is negligible.

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:09.994
And one can talk about a
cosmological model where

00:30:09.994 --> 00:30:11.866
gravity is negligible,
there's nothing

00:30:11.866 --> 00:30:13.740
inconsistent about that.

00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.170
If gravity were
negligible, what would we

00:30:16.170 --> 00:30:19.744
expect for the behavior of
a of t for this [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:19.744 --> 00:30:20.244
question.

00:30:24.670 --> 00:30:26.080
I hear a constant.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.750
Constant is certainly
a possibility,

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.110
but it's not the
only possibility,

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:32.319
so try to think a
little harder, and ask

00:30:32.319 --> 00:30:33.786
if there are other
possibilities.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:39.170
Yes.

00:30:39.170 --> 00:30:41.190
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry, could
you rephrase the question?

00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:42.565
PROFESSOR: Rephrase
the question.

00:30:42.565 --> 00:30:44.830
The question is, if
gravity were negligible,

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:48.850
what would we expect for the
behavior of the scale factor

00:30:48.850 --> 00:30:49.509
a of t?

00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:52.008
And so far, it's been suggested
that it could be a constant,

00:30:52.008 --> 00:30:54.412
and that's true, but that's
not the most general answer.

00:30:54.412 --> 00:30:54.912
Yes.

00:30:54.912 --> 00:30:56.203
AUDIENCE: It could be negative.

00:30:56.203 --> 00:30:57.916
PROFESSOR: Could be negative?

00:30:57.916 --> 00:30:59.892
I don't know what
would mean, actually.

00:30:59.892 --> 00:31:00.850
AUDIENCE: What do you--

00:31:00.850 --> 00:31:03.058
PROFESSOR: It would mean
the universe was inside out.

00:31:03.058 --> 00:31:03.663
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:31:03.663 --> 00:31:04.530
PROFESSOR: It would
really Just mean

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:05.990
that you've reversed
your coordinates.

00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:07.581
I don't think it would
have any significance.

00:31:07.581 --> 00:31:08.523
AUDIENCE: Oh, the
expansion would actually

00:31:08.523 --> 00:31:09.940
be a contraction?

00:31:09.940 --> 00:31:10.770
PROFESSOR: Oh, well
it could decrease

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:12.616
with time, that's not the
same as being negative.

00:31:12.616 --> 00:31:13.330
AUDIENCE: Oh, I'm sorry

00:31:13.330 --> 00:31:15.870
PROFESSOR: It could always
increase or decrease with time,

00:31:15.870 --> 00:31:17.610
whether gravity
is present or not.

00:31:17.610 --> 00:31:19.590
For our universe it's
increasing with time,

00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:22.340
but one could imagine
a contracting universe.

00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:23.996
Yes, Aviv.

00:31:23.996 --> 00:31:24.704
AUDIENCE: Linear?

00:31:24.704 --> 00:31:25.454
PROFESSOR: Linear.

00:31:25.454 --> 00:31:26.350
That's right.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.975
If there's no gravity, a of t
should be a constant times t.

00:31:29.975 --> 00:31:32.779
The constant could be
zero, and then a of t

00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:34.320
is-- and maybe I
should say it should

00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.274
be a constant plus
a constant times t,

00:31:37.274 --> 00:31:40.630
and then in a special case
it could just be a constant.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.880
But it should vary
linearly with time.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:46.174
And that simply means that
all velocities are constant.

00:31:46.174 --> 00:31:51.840
If all velocities are constant,
then a of t is varied linearly

00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:54.270
with time, so that
the distance --

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:58.158
the famous relationship is the
distance of a of t times l sub

00:31:58.158 --> 00:31:59.130
c.

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.322
If this distance were
growing linearly with time,

00:32:01.322 --> 00:32:03.425
it could just be a constant
velocity, which is certainly

00:32:03.425 --> 00:32:04.841
allowed in the
absence of gravity.

00:32:04.841 --> 00:32:07.420
It would mean that a of t
was growing linearly in time.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.705
So that would be the special
case of absence of gravity, a

00:32:10.705 --> 00:32:13.820
of t growing linearly in time.

00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:16.100
And one can always
set the constant

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.130
that would be added to
the linear to be zero,

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.380
just by choosing zero of time
to be the time at which a of t

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:24.140
is zero.

00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.300
So, in the absence of gravity,
one can say that a of t

00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.118
should just be
proportional to t.

00:32:49.140 --> 00:32:51.580
So for that special case,
these two calculations

00:32:51.580 --> 00:32:53.340
should really agree.

00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:56.670
And it will be, I'm pretty
sure, an extra-credit homework

00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:58.918
problem coming up soon, in
which you'll get a chance

00:32:58.918 --> 00:33:00.910
to calculate that.

00:33:00.910 --> 00:33:02.600
It's not easy,
which is why it will

00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.170
be an extra-credit problem,
probably, not required problem,

00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:08.870
because it involves
understanding the relationship

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:10.920
between these two
coordinate systems.

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.570
The special relativity
answer is given

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:17.450
in inertial coordinate system
which, when gravity is present,

00:33:17.450 --> 00:33:18.331
doesn't exist at all.

00:33:18.331 --> 00:33:19.705
In the presence
of gravity, there

00:33:19.705 --> 00:33:23.130
is no global inertial
coordinate system.

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.260
But without its
action, there is.

00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.450
But it's related to this
coordinate system, where

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:30.490
everything's expending
in a complicated way,

00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.913
because of the various
time dilations and Lorentz

00:33:32.913 --> 00:33:35.131
contractions associated
with the motions that

00:33:35.131 --> 00:33:40.320
are taking place in
our expanding universe.

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.270
So what you'll need
to do is to figure out

00:33:42.270 --> 00:33:44.880
the relationship between
these two coordinate systems.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:47.390
And when you do, and
actually compare the answers,

00:33:47.390 --> 00:33:49.725
is you find that they
actually do agree exactly.

00:33:49.725 --> 00:33:52.578
This is all perfectly consistent
with special relativity,

00:33:52.578 --> 00:33:56.550
but the special case
where there is no gravity.

00:33:56.550 --> 00:33:57.500
OK.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.945
Ready to leave cosmological
redshift altogether,

00:34:00.945 --> 00:34:02.570
unless there are any
further questions?

00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:09.630
OK.

00:34:09.630 --> 00:34:13.620
In that case, Onward to
the next major topic.

00:34:13.620 --> 00:34:15.749
We've now finished
what I wanted to say

00:34:15.749 --> 00:34:19.360
about the kinematics of
homogeneously expanding

00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:23.553
universes, and now we're ready
to talk about the dynamics.

00:34:23.553 --> 00:34:25.719
What happens when we try
to think about what gravity

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:28.250
is going to do to
this universe, to be

00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:30.995
able to calculate how a of t
is going to vary with time.

00:34:30.995 --> 00:34:32.907
That will be the only
goal, to understand

00:34:32.907 --> 00:34:35.670
the behavior of a of t.

00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:42.000
Now this problem, in a way,
goes back to Isaac Newton.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.199
And I might just give
a little aside here,

00:34:46.199 --> 00:34:49.380
and mention that one of the
fun things about cosmology,

00:34:49.380 --> 00:34:51.800
actually, is that
if one looks back

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:55.650
at the history of cosmology,
many great physicists have made

00:34:55.650 --> 00:34:59.340
great blunders in trying to
analyze cosmological questions.

00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.470
And in the discussion
today, we'll

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:03.750
be discussing one of
Newton's blunders.

00:35:03.750 --> 00:35:07.450
And to me, it's very
consoling to know that even

00:35:07.450 --> 00:35:11.600
physicists as great as Newton
can make stupid mistakes.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.450
And he actually did
make a stupid mistake,

00:35:13.450 --> 00:35:18.000
in terms of analyzing
the cosmological effect

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.850
of his own theory of gravity.

00:35:20.850 --> 00:35:25.390
At issue was Newton's
view of the universe,

00:35:25.390 --> 00:35:31.440
and Newton, like everybody,
really, until Hubble,

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:33.770
believed that the
universe was static.

00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:36.120
He imagined the universe
as a static distribution

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:40.220
of stars scattered
through space.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:44.450
And early in his career,
from what I understand

00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:48.420
of the history, he assumed
that this distribution of stars

00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:53.480
was finite, and an
infinite background space.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.730
But he realized at
some point that if you

00:35:57.730 --> 00:36:04.160
had a finite distribution of
mass, in otherwise empty space,

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:06.540
that everything would
attract everything else,

00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:09.720
with his one over r squared
force of gravity-- which

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:13.170
he knew about, he invented
it-- and the result would

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:16.880
be everything would
collapse to a point.

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.717
So he decided that
would not work,

00:36:19.717 --> 00:36:21.550
but he was still sure
everything was static.

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:22.925
Because everything
looked static,

00:36:22.925 --> 00:36:26.130
stars don't seem
to move very much.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:29.360
So he asked what
he could change,

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:32.470
and decided that instead of
assuming that the stars made up

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:34.680
a finite distribution,
he could assume

00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.350
that they were an infinite
distribution, sharing

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.200
all of space.

00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.060
And he reasoned--
and this is really

00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:45.420
where the fallacy
showed up-- but he

00:36:45.420 --> 00:36:52.195
reasoned that if the stars
filled the infinite space

00:36:52.195 --> 00:36:54.570
that, even though they would
all be tugging on each other

00:36:54.570 --> 00:36:57.030
through the force
of gravity, they

00:36:57.030 --> 00:36:58.590
wouldn't know which way to go.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:00.464
And since they wouldn't
know which way to go,

00:37:00.464 --> 00:37:02.260
because they'd be tugged
in all directions,

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:04.750
they would stand still.

00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:09.700
So he believed that an infinite,
uniform, distribution of mass

00:37:09.700 --> 00:37:12.510
would be stable-- that there'd
be no gravitational forces

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:16.654
resulting from the masses in
this infinite distribution.

00:37:16.654 --> 00:37:18.070
And I have some
quotes here, which

00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:20.560
I think are kind of cute,
so I'll show them to you.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.120
Newton had a long discussion
about these issues

00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:26.350
with Richard Bentley,
the theologian.

00:37:26.350 --> 00:37:29.360
And we get to read about it,
because all these letters have

00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:30.160
been preserved.

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.110
In fact, I'm told that the
original letters are actually

00:37:33.110 --> 00:37:35.900
still in existence at
Trinity College in Cambridge

00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:37.167
University.

00:37:37.167 --> 00:37:38.750
And you can find
them on the web even,

00:37:38.750 --> 00:37:41.660
I'll give you a web reference
for the text of these letters,

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.820
and they're in books
and various places.

00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:45.987
So let me read this to you.

00:37:45.987 --> 00:37:48.490
I think it's a cute quotation.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:50.080
"As to your first
query"-- by the way,

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:52.329
I think we don't have the
letters that Richard Bentley

00:37:52.329 --> 00:37:55.570
sent to Newton,
only the responses.

00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:58.511
But Newton fortunately
responded in a way

00:37:58.511 --> 00:38:00.052
that made the
questions pretty clear,

00:38:00.052 --> 00:38:02.385
so it's not an important
problem in understanding what's

00:38:02.385 --> 00:38:04.330
going on.

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:07.230
Newton says, "It seems to me
that if the matter of our sun

00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:10.490
and planets and all the matter
of the universe were evenly

00:38:10.490 --> 00:38:12.695
scattered throughout
all the heavens,

00:38:12.695 --> 00:38:16.560
and every particle had an innate
gravity toward all the rest,

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.840
and the whole space throughout
which this matter was scattered

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.200
was but finite, the matter
on the outside space would,

00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:27.610
by its gravity, tend toward
all the matter on the inside"--

00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:30.874
this is a finite universe he's
talking about -- and he says,

00:38:30.874 --> 00:38:33.040
"that by its consequence,
everything would fall down

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.090
into the middle of
the whole space,

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:39.260
and there compose one
great spherical mass."

00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:41.430
So, there he's describing
how it would not

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:47.130
work if you had a finite
collection of matter.

00:38:47.130 --> 00:38:49.290
But, he says, "If
the matter was evenly

00:38:49.290 --> 00:38:52.210
disposed throughout
an infinite space,

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:57.130
it could never convene into
one mass, but some of it

00:38:57.130 --> 00:38:58.800
would convene into
one mass, and some

00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:01.515
into another, to as to
make an infinite number

00:39:01.515 --> 00:39:04.790
of great masses, scattered
at great distances

00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:08.077
from one to another, throughout
all that infinite space."

00:39:08.077 --> 00:39:10.660
So he thought there'd be local
coagulation, which of course is

00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:11.950
what we see in our real world.

00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:14.060
We see stars that have
formed, and now we

00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:15.495
know about galaxies,
which Newton

00:39:15.495 --> 00:39:16.680
had no way of knowing about.

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:22.020
That's the kind of coagulation
process that he's discussing.

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.130
And he-- oops, sorry.

00:39:27.310 --> 00:39:29.475
"And thus might the
sun and the fixed stars

00:39:29.475 --> 00:39:33.664
be formed, supposing the
matter were of a lucid nature."

00:39:33.664 --> 00:39:35.640
That's a cute phrase.

00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.130
I can tell you what it
means, it may not be obvious.

00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:40.700
But at this point,
nobody had any idea

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.305
what the sun was
made out of, and why

00:39:42.305 --> 00:39:43.846
the sun was different
from the earth.

00:39:43.846 --> 00:39:46.220
In fact nobody really had
much of a real idea what

00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:49.750
the earth was made
out of either, here.

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:53.300
Chemistry wasn't
really invented yet.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.870
So the assumption
was that there were

00:39:55.870 --> 00:40:00.550
two kinds of matter, lucid
matter and opaque matter.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:03.305
Where lucid matter is the
stuff the sun is made out of,

00:40:03.305 --> 00:40:07.230
and the stars, that glows,
and is fundamentally different

00:40:07.230 --> 00:40:09.917
in some way, that was of
course not understood at all,

00:40:09.917 --> 00:40:12.375
from opaque matter, which is
what the Earth is made out of.

00:40:12.375 --> 00:40:15.860
You can't see through it, and
it doesn't, obviously, glow.

00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:19.910
So here, when he's
talking about matter

00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:22.310
forming the stars
and the sun, he

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.119
says if the matter
was lucid, if it

00:40:25.119 --> 00:40:26.535
was the kind of
matter that glows.

00:40:31.090 --> 00:40:35.800
Going on-- so far, what he
said sounds pretty good.

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.740
Going on, he goes
on now to talk more

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.842
about this lucid
versus opaque business.

00:40:39.842 --> 00:40:41.107
And I think it's cute.

00:40:41.107 --> 00:40:42.690
I don't know where
exactly it's going,

00:40:42.690 --> 00:40:45.023
but it shows something about
Newton's personality, which

00:40:45.023 --> 00:40:47.839
one might not have
known otherwise.

00:40:47.839 --> 00:40:49.630
"But how the matter
should divide itself"--

00:40:49.630 --> 00:40:53.470
I should also warn you, all
of this is one sentence.

00:40:53.470 --> 00:40:56.210
If you think sometimes my
sentences sound convoluted,

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:58.710
just think how lucky you are
that you don't have Newton here

00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:59.550
as your lecturer.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:01.390
This is just impossible.

00:41:01.390 --> 00:41:05.770
So, "But how the matter should
divide itself into two sorts"--

00:41:05.770 --> 00:41:08.630
how we'd have lucid and opaque
matter in the right places--

00:41:08.630 --> 00:41:11.480
"and that part of it which is to
comprise a shining body should

00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:15.080
fall down into one mass, and
make a sun, and the rest,

00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.210
of which is fit to
compose an opaque body,

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:20.826
should coalesce not into one
great body, like shiny matter,

00:41:20.826 --> 00:41:23.200
but into many little ones"--
somehow he's forgotten about

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.158
the stars here, when he's
talking about the sun

00:41:25.158 --> 00:41:28.240
and the planets, many
planets and one sun.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:37.190
So he says that, "how the opaque
matter should fall instead

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.802
into many little
masses"-- and then

00:41:40.802 --> 00:41:42.260
he talks about
other possibilities.

00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:44.900
It's wonderful the way he
lists all the possibilities.

00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:48.040
"Or," he says, "if the sun
were at first an opaque body,

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:51.875
like the planets, or if the
planets were lucid bodies like

00:41:51.875 --> 00:41:55.345
the sun, how he alone"--
he being the sun,

00:41:55.345 --> 00:41:59.080
if you track everything back,
"how the sun alone should be

00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:04.620
changed into a shiny body,
while all the"-- lost track --

00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.150
"where all they"--
of the planets--

00:42:07.150 --> 00:42:10.280
"continue to be opaque,
or"-- he's considering all

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.070
possibilities-- "or they all
be changed to opaque ones,

00:42:13.070 --> 00:42:17.560
while he,"-- the sun-- "remains
unchanged as a lucid one."

00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.435
He does not know how to explain
all that, is what he's saying.

00:42:20.435 --> 00:42:22.310
Bottom line of the
sentence is, I don't know,

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:23.752
I don't have a clue.

00:42:23.752 --> 00:42:26.210
And he says, "I don't think
it's explicable by mere natural

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.080
causes, but am
forced," Newton says,

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.830
"to ascribe it to the
council and contrivance

00:42:31.830 --> 00:42:34.850
of a voluntary agent."

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:37.180
So the theory of
intelligence design,

00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.900
as well the theory
of gravity, actually

00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:41.600
both go back to
Newton, it turns out.

00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.104
Newton was a very
religious person,

00:42:43.104 --> 00:42:44.520
and in certain
aspects of physics,

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:48.255
he was happy to ascribe
to a voluntary agent,

00:42:48.255 --> 00:42:50.440
as he calls it.

00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.052
I have some references
here, and I'll

00:42:52.052 --> 00:42:53.760
be posting this so
you'll be able to read

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.718
those references and type
them in, if you want.

00:42:58.362 --> 00:43:04.140
Now Newton decided
that you could not

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.471
have a finite distribution,
because it would collapse.

00:43:07.471 --> 00:43:08.970
If you had an
infinite distribution,

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:11.970
he thought it would be
stable, but he apparently

00:43:11.970 --> 00:43:16.180
had heard different arguments
to that same conclusion.

00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.930
And one argument
that you might give

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:21.305
for saying that the infinite
distribution would be stable

00:43:21.305 --> 00:43:25.040
would be the argument that
if you look at the force

00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.780
one any one particle, there is
an infinite force pulling it

00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:31.100
to the right-- my right,
your left-- and an infinite

00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:34.060
force pulling it to
my left, your right,

00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.210
and since they're both infinite,
they would cancel each other.

00:43:37.210 --> 00:43:39.700
Newton did not
accept that argument.

00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.160
He was sophisticated enough
to realize that infinity minus

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:45.620
infinity isn't necessarily zero.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:47.916
And he has a bit of
a tirade on that,

00:43:47.916 --> 00:43:49.290
that I thought
was worth quoting.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:53.380
And this is a second letter
to the same Richard Bentley.

00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.296
I guess it was Bentley
who made this argument,

00:43:55.296 --> 00:43:57.190
and Newton rejected it.

00:43:57.190 --> 00:44:00.230
Infinity minus infinity,
Newton realized, is ambiguous.

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:02.220
It's not something that
we should necessarily

00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:03.710
think of zero.

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:06.460
"But you argue in the next
paragraph of your letter that

00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:09.310
every particle of the matter
in the infinite space has

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:11.810
an infinite quantity
of matter on all sides,

00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.470
and by consequence, an
infinite attraction every way,

00:44:15.470 --> 00:44:18.450
and therefore must
rest in equilibrio,

00:44:18.450 --> 00:44:20.190
because all infinities
are equal:"--

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:23.530
he's summarizing Richard
Bentley's argument--

00:44:23.530 --> 00:44:28.057
"yet you suspect a parologism"--
that means logical error,

00:44:28.057 --> 00:44:33.240
I think-- "in this argument: and
I can see the paralogism lies

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.700
in the position that all
infinities are equal.

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:40.400
The generality of mankind
consider infinities no other

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:43.510
ways than indefinitely"-- and
in this sentence they said all

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:47.380
infinities are equal-- "though
they would speak more truly

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.010
if they should say that they
are neither equal nor unequal,

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:54.230
nor have any certain difference
or proportion, one to another."

00:44:54.230 --> 00:44:57.302
So he realizes that the ratio
of infinity could be anything,

00:44:57.302 --> 00:45:00.210
and infinity minus infinity
could be anything, all of which

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:01.960
is consistent with
our modern view of how

00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.920
to do the mathematics.

00:45:03.920 --> 00:45:05.780
"In this sense,
therefore, no conclusions

00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.090
can be drawn from them about
the equality, proportions

00:45:09.090 --> 00:45:12.870
or differences of things, and
they that attempt to do so

00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:17.552
usually fall into paralogisms."

00:45:17.552 --> 00:45:20.610
He goes on, now I just have
one more Newton quote--

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.232
I like Newton quotes--

00:45:22.232 --> 00:45:23.690
I have one more
Newton quote, again

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:25.580
from the same series of letters.

00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:27.850
These are all from
1692 and 1693,

00:45:27.850 --> 00:45:30.800
I believe, where he
gives an example--

00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:33.110
I think this follows the
quotes of the previous slide

00:45:33.110 --> 00:45:35.575
immediately-- where he gives
an example of a false argument

00:45:35.575 --> 00:45:37.700
that you get into-- and
apparently it's an argument

00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:39.530
that he had heard
from other people--

00:45:39.530 --> 00:45:42.290
if you think all
infinities are equal.

00:45:42.290 --> 00:45:45.296
What he says is, "So when men"--
he doesn't say who men are,

00:45:45.296 --> 00:45:46.796
and I don't really
know the history.

00:45:46.796 --> 00:45:49.300
He may referring to some
particular philosophers

00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:53.480
at the time-- "when men argue
that the infinite divisibility

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:57.730
of magnitude by saying
that an inch may be divided

00:45:57.730 --> 00:46:01.310
into an infinite number of
parts, the sum of those parts

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:04.250
would be an inch--
and a foot can

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:06.600
be divided into an
infinite number of parts,

00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:09.330
the sum of those
parts must be a foot--

00:46:09.330 --> 00:46:12.000
and therefore, since all
infinities are equal,

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.302
these sums must be equal."

00:46:14.302 --> 00:46:15.510
Understand the argument here.

00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:16.690
He's saying that if
you divide and inch

00:46:16.690 --> 00:46:18.106
into an infinite
number of parts--

00:46:18.106 --> 00:46:19.950
this is all you've
been given as a foil.

00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:22.020
He's not claiming the
argument is right,

00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.950
he's claiming it's wrong-- that
argument is that if you divide

00:46:23.950 --> 00:46:25.355
an inch into an infinite
number of parts,

00:46:25.355 --> 00:46:27.020
you get an infinite
number of points,

00:46:27.020 --> 00:46:29.195
if you put them together,
you get an inch.

00:46:29.195 --> 00:46:31.445
If you divide a foot into
an infinite number of parts,

00:46:31.445 --> 00:46:33.170
you get an infinite
number of points,

00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:35.760
and if you put them together,
you should get a foot.

00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.700
But they're both
an infinite number

00:46:37.700 --> 00:46:39.460
of points in the description.

00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.255
So if you think all
infinities are equal,

00:46:41.255 --> 00:46:43.000
the infinite number of
points that make an inch

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.100
should be the same as the
infinite number of points that

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:47.225
make a foot, therefore a
foot should equal an inch,

00:46:47.225 --> 00:46:48.150
obviously.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:49.142
Right.

00:46:49.142 --> 00:46:51.110
Not right, he know.

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:54.630
So he says that the
falseness of the conclusion

00:46:54.630 --> 00:46:57.170
shows an error in the
premises, and the error lies

00:46:57.170 --> 00:47:00.640
in the position that all
infinities are equal.

00:47:00.640 --> 00:47:02.990
So Newton has given
us a very nice example

00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:05.280
of how you can convince
yourself that you

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:07.970
get into logical
paradoxes if you pretend

00:47:07.970 --> 00:47:11.240
that all infinities are equal.

00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:12.939
But, this does not
change the fact

00:47:12.939 --> 00:47:15.480
that Newton was still convinced
that an infinite distribution

00:47:15.480 --> 00:47:18.170
of mass would be stable.

00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:20.670
The argument that convinced
him was not the infinity

00:47:20.670 --> 00:47:23.690
on each side, but
rather the symmetry.

00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:25.736
Newton's argument,
the one he believed,

00:47:25.736 --> 00:47:27.110
was that if you
look at any point

00:47:27.110 --> 00:47:30.590
in this infinite distribution,
if you look around that point,

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:32.965
all directions would look
exactly the same, with matter

00:47:32.965 --> 00:47:34.964
extending off to infinity,
and therefore there'd

00:47:34.964 --> 00:47:36.940
be no direction that
the force should

00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.229
point on any given particle.

00:47:39.229 --> 00:47:41.520
And if there's no direction
in that force at the point,

00:47:41.520 --> 00:47:42.730
it must be zero.

00:47:42.730 --> 00:47:45.930
That was the argument
Newton believed.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:46.430
OK.

00:47:46.430 --> 00:47:49.870
What I want to do now is to
talk about this in a little bit

00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:53.050
more detail, and
try to understand

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:57.157
how modern folks would
look at the argument.

00:47:57.157 --> 00:47:59.240
And by the way, I might
just add a little bit more

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.675
about the history first.

00:48:00.675 --> 00:48:02.570
Newton's argument,
as far as I know,

00:48:02.570 --> 00:48:06.505
was not questioned by anybody
for hundreds of years,

00:48:06.505 --> 00:48:08.750
until the time of
Albert Einstein.

00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:12.330
Albert Einstein, in trying
to describe cosmology using

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:15.006
his new theory of
general relativity,

00:48:15.006 --> 00:48:16.380
was the first
person, as far as I

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.720
know, to realize
that even if you

00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:22.170
had an infinite distribution
of mass, it would collapse--

00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:24.085
and we'll talk about why.

00:48:24.085 --> 00:48:26.460
And Einstein did realize that
the same thing would happen

00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.110
with Newtonian physics,
it's not really

00:48:28.110 --> 00:48:29.810
a special feature of
general relativity,

00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:32.220
it just somehow
historically took

00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:34.740
the invention of
general relativity

00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:37.690
to cause people to
rethink these ideas

00:48:37.690 --> 00:48:42.470
and realize that
Newton had been wrong.

00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:43.670
So, what's going on.

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:09.860
The difficulty in trying
to analyze things the way

00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:14.270
in which Newton did is that
Newton was thinking of gravity,

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:17.357
in the language that he
first proposed it, as a force

00:49:17.357 --> 00:49:17.940
at a distance.

00:49:17.940 --> 00:49:21.745
If you have two objects in
space, the distance r apart,

00:49:21.745 --> 00:49:24.320
they will exert a force on
each other proportional to one

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.020
over r squared.

00:49:27.020 --> 00:49:29.120
Since the time of
Newton, other ways

00:49:29.120 --> 00:49:31.557
of describing Newtonian
gravity itself

00:49:31.557 --> 00:49:33.890
have been invented, which
make it much more clear what's

00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:35.050
going on.

00:49:35.050 --> 00:49:36.870
The difficulty in
using Newton's method--

00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:39.619
we'll talk about in more
detail in a few minutes--

00:49:39.619 --> 00:49:42.160
but it's simply that we try to
add up all of these one over r

00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.635
squared forces, you
get divergent sums

00:49:44.635 --> 00:49:48.330
that you have to figure
out how to interpret.

00:49:48.330 --> 00:49:50.610
But to understand that
Newton couldn't possibly

00:49:50.610 --> 00:49:53.230
have been right, the
easiest thing to do

00:49:53.230 --> 00:49:56.870
is to look at other formulations
of Newton's gravity.

00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:59.180
And I'll describe two
of them, both of which

00:49:59.180 --> 00:50:03.202
will probably have some
familiarity to you.

00:50:03.202 --> 00:50:04.950
The first one I'm
quite sure will.

00:50:04.950 --> 00:50:09.920
And I'm going to describe it
by analogy with Coulomb's law,

00:50:09.920 --> 00:50:12.920
because 802 goes a little
further with Coulomb's law

00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:15.170
than any course you are
likely to have taken

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:16.874
has gone with gravity.

00:50:16.874 --> 00:50:18.915
But Coulomb's law is really
the same as the force

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:19.840
law of gravity.

00:50:19.840 --> 00:50:21.720
So Coulomb's law
says that any charged

00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:24.560
particle will create an
electric field, which

00:50:24.560 --> 00:50:27.530
is the charge divided by the
distance squared times the unit

00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.842
vector pointing
radially outward.

00:50:29.842 --> 00:50:31.730
That's Coulomb's law.

00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:33.944
People can-- sometimes
there's constants in here,

00:50:33.944 --> 00:50:35.720
depending on what
units you measure q in,

00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.010
but that won't be
important for us.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:39.627
So I'm going to
assume we're using

00:50:39.627 --> 00:50:40.960
this where that constant is one.

00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:49.000
You know that Coulomb's
law can be reformulated

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.232
in terms of what we
call Gauss's law.

00:50:51.232 --> 00:50:53.850
If Coulomb's law is true, you
can make a definite statement

00:50:53.850 --> 00:50:55.391
about what happens
when you integrate

00:50:55.391 --> 00:50:58.060
the flux of the electric
field over any surface.

00:50:58.060 --> 00:51:02.380
It's proportionate to the
total amount of charge inside.

00:51:02.380 --> 00:51:07.800
So Coulomb's law
implies Gauss's law,

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:14.692
which says that the integral
over any closed surface of E

00:51:14.692 --> 00:51:24.310
dotted into da is equal to 4
pi times the total enclosed

00:51:24.310 --> 00:51:26.690
charge.

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:31.340
q encloses the total amount
of charge inside that volume.

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.500
And what constants appear
depends on what constants

00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:36.090
appear here, which depends
on what units you're using,

00:51:36.090 --> 00:51:38.700
but these equations
are consistent.

00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:41.520
Those are the correct
constants, if you

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:44.880
measure charge in a way which
makes the electric field be

00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:46.745
given by that simple formula.

00:51:46.745 --> 00:51:49.286
OK, so I'm going to assume you
know this, that you learned it

00:51:49.286 --> 00:51:51.880
in 802 or elsewhere.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:53.720
If this is true,
then, since this

00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.560
is the same inverse square
law, if we write down

00:51:56.560 --> 00:51:58.269
Newton's law of gravity,
almost as Newton

00:51:58.269 --> 00:51:59.934
would have written
it, we can express it

00:51:59.934 --> 00:52:01.790
as the acceleration
of gravity at a given

00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:03.762
distance from an object.

00:52:03.762 --> 00:52:05.470
So we could write
Newton's law of gravity

00:52:05.470 --> 00:52:07.440
by saying the
acceleration of gravity

00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:11.320
is equal to minus Newton's
constant times the mass

00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:15.090
of the object, the analog
of the charge up there,

00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:18.942
divided by r
squared times r hat.

00:52:18.942 --> 00:52:20.525
Again, it's the
inverse r squared law,

00:52:20.525 --> 00:52:23.030
and the point radiating outward
is just like Coulomb's law,

00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:26.187
except for the
constant out front.

00:52:26.187 --> 00:52:28.020
The constant actually
has the opposite sign,

00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.478
which is important
for some issues,

00:52:29.478 --> 00:52:31.780
but not for what
we're saying now.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.160
The important point
is that this can also

00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:37.390
be recast as a
Gauss's law, and it's

00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:40.107
called Gauss's law of gravity.

00:52:40.107 --> 00:52:42.440
And the only thing that differs
is a constant out front,

00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.920
so it's a trivial
transformation.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.980
The integral over
any closed surface

00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.440
of the gravitational
acceleration vector, little g

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:59.918
dotted into da is
equal to minus 4 pi

00:52:59.918 --> 00:53:03.020
g times the total mass enclosed.

00:53:06.918 --> 00:53:09.126
The only difference is the
minus sign, and the factor

00:53:09.126 --> 00:53:14.152
of g, which follow from the
difference of the minus sign

00:53:14.152 --> 00:53:16.110
and the factor of g in
the formula on the left.

00:53:18.894 --> 00:53:21.319
OK, does everybody believe that?

00:53:21.319 --> 00:53:23.610
OK, now let's think about
this homogeneous distribution

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:26.027
of mass that Newton was
trying to think about.

00:53:26.027 --> 00:53:27.590
Newton's claim
was that you could

00:53:27.590 --> 00:53:29.740
have a homogeneous
distribution of mass filling

00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:33.260
all of the infinite space, and
that would be static, that is,

00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.180
there would be no acceleration.

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:37.700
No acceleration means Newton
is claiming in this language

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:40.820
that little g could
be zero everywhere.

00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:44.000
But if you look at this formula,
if little g is zero everywhere,

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.890
then the integral of g over
any surface is going to zero,

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.640
and therefore the total mass
enclosed had better be zero.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.760
But if we have a uniform
distribution of mass,

00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.590
the total mass enclosed
will certainly not

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:56.870
be zero for anything
with non-zero volume.

00:53:56.870 --> 00:54:00.590
So clearly this assertion that
the system would be static

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:05.420
was in direct contradiction
with the Gauss's law formulation

00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:06.550
of Newton's law of gravity.

00:54:12.759 --> 00:54:14.300
Just for the fun of
it, I'll give you

00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:24.620
another similar argument using
another more modern formulation

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:25.535
of Newtonian gravity.

00:54:35.035 --> 00:54:37.160
Another way of formulating
Newtonian gravity, which

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:39.580
you may or may not have seen--
and if you haven't seen it,

00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:41.100
don't understand what I'm
saying, don't worry about it,

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.540
it's not that important.

00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.190
But for those of you
who have seen it,

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:46.950
I'll give you this argument.

00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:49.030
Another way of formulating
Newtonian gravity

00:54:49.030 --> 00:54:52.620
is to introduce the
gravitational potential.

00:54:52.620 --> 00:54:54.620
So I'm going to
use the letter phi

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:56.870
for the gravitational potential.

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:59.726
I'll tell you in a second how
that relates to gravity-- well,

00:54:59.726 --> 00:55:01.120
I guess I'll tell you now.

00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.800
It's related to the
gravitational acceleration

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:11.140
by g is equal to minus
the gradient of phi,

00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:16.010
and gradient of phi is
something that you probably all

00:55:16.010 --> 00:55:21.160
learned in 802, but I'll
write down the formula anyway.

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.250
It's equal to i hat, a unit
vector in the x direction,

00:55:24.250 --> 00:55:26.560
times the derivative
of phi with respect

00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.410
to x, plus j hat, a unit
vector in the y direction,

00:55:31.410 --> 00:55:34.624
times the partial of
phi with respect to y,

00:55:34.624 --> 00:55:39.564
plus k hat times the partial
of phi with respect to z.

00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:46.500
And once one defines this
gravitational potential,

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:48.420
one can write down
the differential form

00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.710
of the Gauss's
law, which becomes

00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:52.668
what's called
Laplace's equation.

00:55:52.668 --> 00:56:00.500
And it says the
del squared phi is

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:08.531
equal to 4 pi times
Newton's constant times rho,

00:56:08.531 --> 00:56:12.475
where rho is the mass density.

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.192
And this is called
Laplace's equation,

00:56:24.192 --> 00:56:26.330
and if you're given
the mass density,

00:56:26.330 --> 00:56:29.197
it allows you to find the
gravitational potential,

00:56:29.197 --> 00:56:30.655
and then you can
take its gradient,

00:56:30.655 --> 00:56:33.510
and that determines what g is.

00:56:33.510 --> 00:56:37.110
And it's equivalent to the
other formulations of gravity.

00:56:37.110 --> 00:56:40.570
But it gives us another
test of Newton's claim

00:56:40.570 --> 00:56:43.460
that you could have a
homogeneous distribution

00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:46.750
of matter, and no
gravitational forces.

00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:49.580
If there are no
gravitational forces,

00:56:49.580 --> 00:56:53.200
then g would have to be zero,
as we said a minute ago,

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:55.090
and this formulation
of g is zero,

00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:58.660
that implies the
gradient of phi is zero.

00:56:58.660 --> 00:57:01.120
If we look at the formula for
the gradient, it's a vector.

00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.411
For the vector to be zero,
each of the three components

00:57:03.411 --> 00:57:05.630
has to be zero, and
therefore the derivative

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:07.450
of phi with respect
to x has to vanish,

00:57:07.450 --> 00:57:09.700
the derivative of phi with
respect to y has to vanish,

00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:12.330
the derivative of phi with
respect to z has to vanish,

00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:13.780
that means phi has to
be constant everywhere,

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:15.154
it has no derivative
with respect

00:57:15.154 --> 00:57:17.310
to any spacial coordinate.

00:57:17.310 --> 00:57:20.640
So if g vanishes,
the gradient of phi

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:23.770
vanishes, and phi is a
constant throughout space.

00:57:23.770 --> 00:57:25.990
And if phi is a constant
throughout space,

00:57:25.990 --> 00:57:27.380
now we can look
at this formula--

00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:30.990
and I forgot to write down
the definition of del squared.

00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:36.020
Del squared phi is defined to
be the second derivative of phi

00:57:36.020 --> 00:57:41.990
with respect to x squared, plus
the second derivative of phi

00:57:41.990 --> 00:57:48.500
with respect to y squared, plus
the second derivative of phi

00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.560
with respect to z squared.

00:57:51.560 --> 00:57:53.440
So if phi is a
constant everywhere,

00:57:53.440 --> 00:57:56.610
as it would have to be if there
were no gravitational forces,

00:57:56.610 --> 00:57:58.649
then one can see immediately
from this equation

00:57:58.649 --> 00:58:00.440
that del squared phi
would have to be zero,

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.640
and one can see
from this equation

00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.181
that rho would have
to be zero, there

00:58:03.181 --> 00:58:04.867
would have to be
no mass density.

00:58:04.867 --> 00:58:06.575
But Newton wanted to
have a non-zero mass

00:58:06.575 --> 00:58:08.830
density, the matter
of the universe spread

00:58:08.830 --> 00:58:11.060
out uniformly over
an infinite space.

00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:14.730
So this is another demonstration
that Newton's argument

00:58:14.730 --> 00:58:17.500
was inconsistent.

00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:18.000
Yes.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:21.074
AUDIENCE: I'm sorry,
what does phi represent?

00:58:21.074 --> 00:58:23.240
PROFESSOR: Phi is really
defined by these equations,

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.130
it's defined, really,
by this equation.

00:58:25.130 --> 00:58:29.615
The name is that it's the
gravitational potential.

00:58:29.615 --> 00:58:30.448
AUDIENCE: Potential.

00:58:37.782 --> 00:58:39.240
PROFESSOR: And its
physical meaning

00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:41.450
is simply that it
gives you another way

00:58:41.450 --> 00:58:43.762
of writing what g is.

00:58:43.762 --> 00:58:44.387
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:58:49.249 --> 00:58:50.540
PROFESSOR: Any other questions?

00:58:55.240 --> 00:58:59.210
OK, so the conclusion seems
to be that Newton has not

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:01.770
gotten the right answer,
here, but we still

00:59:01.770 --> 00:59:03.653
have to analyze Newton's
argument a little bi

00:59:03.653 --> 00:59:07.730
more carefully, to see
exactly where he went wrong.

00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:11.230
So, the next thing
I want to talk about

00:59:11.230 --> 00:59:16.120
is the ambiguity associated with
trying to add up the Newtonian

00:59:16.120 --> 00:59:18.970
gravitational
forces, as Newton was

00:59:18.970 --> 00:59:22.220
thinking, for an
infinite universe.

00:59:22.220 --> 00:59:24.380
I mentioned that the real
problem with Newton's

00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:28.820
calculation is that the quantum
he was calculating actually

00:59:28.820 --> 00:59:31.330
diverges, and you have to
be more careful about trying

00:59:31.330 --> 00:59:33.440
to calculate it
in a reliable way.

00:59:50.250 --> 00:59:52.050
So to make this
clear, I want to begin

00:59:52.050 --> 00:59:57.060
by giving an example of this
general notion of integrals

00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.190
that give ambiguous values.

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:03.530
And I want to define just a
couple of mathematical terms.

01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:06.673
I want to consider
just-- again, starting

01:00:06.673 --> 01:00:09.172
talking about general functions,
and when integrals are well

01:00:09.172 --> 01:00:10.770
defined and when they're not.

01:00:10.770 --> 01:00:14.920
I want to imagine that we just
have some arbitrary function

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:18.141
f of x where x would not
just be one variable.

01:00:18.141 --> 01:00:20.140
We'll generalize this to
three dimensions, which

01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.450
is the case that we'll
be interested in,

01:00:22.450 --> 01:00:24.835
but we'll start by talking
in terms of one variable.

01:00:24.835 --> 01:00:28.080
If we have a function
f of x, we can

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.620
discuss what I'll
call I sub 1, which

01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:35.279
is the integral, from
minus infinity to infinity,

01:00:35.279 --> 01:00:38.237
of f of x dx.

01:00:38.237 --> 01:00:39.845
This is exactly the
kind of integral

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:41.440
that you're thinking
of when we wanted

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:44.670
to-- thinking about adding up
all the gravitational forces

01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:46.100
acting on a given body.

01:00:52.610 --> 01:01:05.076
Now I want to consider the
case where I1 is finite.

01:01:05.076 --> 01:01:05.937
I'm sorry.

01:01:05.937 --> 01:01:08.270
I need to first define more
carefully what I mean by I1.

01:01:14.294 --> 01:01:17.020
OK, to even define what you mean
by this minus v to infinity,

01:01:17.020 --> 01:01:19.740
you should say something
a little bit more precise.

01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:22.640
So we could define I1 a
little bit more precisely,

01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:26.247
and I'll call this I1
prime, for clarity.

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:27.830
This will really
just be a clearer way

01:01:27.830 --> 01:01:29.507
of describing what
one probably meant

01:01:29.507 --> 01:01:31.854
when one wrote the first line.

01:01:31.854 --> 01:01:33.770
We can define the integral
from minus infinity

01:01:33.770 --> 01:01:39.130
to infinity as the limit,
as some quantity L goes

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:46.152
to infinity, of the integral
from minus L to L of f of x dx.

01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:52.380
So this says to do the
integral from minus L to L,

01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.340
and if we assume f of
x is itself finite,

01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:55.400
this is always finite.

01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:58.490
I will assume f of
x itself is finite,

01:01:58.490 --> 01:02:01.390
we'll only worry about the
convergence of the integral.

01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:04.800
So for any given L, this is
a number, then you can ask,

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.562
does this number approach a
limit as L goes to infinity?

01:02:08.562 --> 01:02:11.170
And if it does, you say that's
the value of this integral.

01:02:11.170 --> 01:02:13.094
That just defines what
we mean by the integral

01:02:13.094 --> 01:02:15.980
from minus infinity to infinity.

01:02:15.980 --> 01:02:18.172
I want to now consider the
case where that exists.

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:29.740
So consider the case where
I1 prime is-- I'll write

01:02:29.740 --> 01:02:33.520
is less than infinity, meaning
it has some finite value.

01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.655
The limit as L goes
to infinity exists.

01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:42.888
But now, I want
to also consider--

01:02:42.888 --> 01:02:44.930
and I'll move on to
the next blackboard--

01:02:44.930 --> 01:03:01.450
to consider this-- consider
an integral that I'll call I2,

01:03:01.450 --> 01:03:03.900
for future reference,
which is just

01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:08.400
defined to be the integral from
minus infinity to infinity.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.750
Defined as the same kind
of limit that we used here,

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:12.205
but I won't rewrite it.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:14.455
I'll just assume that the
integral from minus infinity

01:03:14.455 --> 01:03:16.689
to infinity means that limit.

01:03:16.689 --> 01:03:18.980
But I want to consider the
integral from minus infinity

01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:24.120
to infinity of the absolute
value of f of x dx.

01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:31.600
And now I want to
introduce some terminology.

01:03:34.690 --> 01:03:43.900
If I2 is less than
infinity, if it converges,

01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:49.740
then I1 is called
absolutely convergent.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:05.130
So absolutely convergent
means that it would converge,

01:04:05.130 --> 01:04:06.680
even if you had
absolute value signs.

01:04:10.784 --> 01:04:16.770
Conversely, this
I2 is divergent--

01:04:16.770 --> 01:04:19.470
and I'll just write that
as I2 equals infinity,

01:04:19.470 --> 01:04:24.856
if that limit does not exist,
if its a divergent integral.

01:04:24.856 --> 01:04:28.350
But remember, we
assumed I1 did exist,

01:04:28.350 --> 01:04:30.767
so I1 still converges, but
it's called conditionally

01:04:30.767 --> 01:04:31.267
convergent.

01:04:49.616 --> 01:04:51.490
So if an integral
converges, but the integral

01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:54.210
of the absolute value of that
same client does not converge,

01:04:54.210 --> 01:04:56.829
that's the case that's called
conditional convergence.

01:04:56.829 --> 01:04:58.370
And the moral of
the story, that I'll

01:04:58.370 --> 01:05:02.800
be beginning to tell you now,
is that conditionally convergent

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.714
integrals are very dangerous.

01:05:04.714 --> 01:05:06.880
What makes them dangerous
is that they're not really

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.970
well defined.

01:05:07.970 --> 01:05:11.180
You can get any value
you want by adding up

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:14.520
the integrand in
different orders.

01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.760
As long as you stick to
a particular order, which

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:20.310
is how we define the symbol,
you will get a unique answer,

01:05:20.310 --> 01:05:22.750
but if, for example, you
just shift your origin,

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.457
you can get a
different answer, which

01:05:25.457 --> 01:05:27.040
is something you
don't usually expect.

01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.680
You usually think of
just integrating over

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:30.263
the whole real line,
it doesn't matter

01:05:30.263 --> 01:05:32.770
what you took to be
the center of the line.

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:34.565
So things become much
less well defined

01:05:34.565 --> 01:05:37.680
when one is discussing
conditionally

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.030
convergent integrals.

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:42.277
And before we get to
the particular integral

01:05:42.277 --> 01:05:43.860
that we're really
interested in, which

01:05:43.860 --> 01:05:45.818
is trying to add up the
gravitational forces of

01:05:45.818 --> 01:05:48.355
and infinite distribution of
matter, which I'll get to,

01:05:48.355 --> 01:05:50.980
I'm going to give you an example
of a very simple function that

01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:54.560
just illustrates this ambiguity,
that the integral converges,

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:55.990
but is not absolutely
convergent.

01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:58.857
You can get any answer
you want by adding it

01:05:58.857 --> 01:06:01.930
in different orders-- adding
up the pieces of the integral

01:06:01.930 --> 01:06:03.950
in different orders.

01:06:03.950 --> 01:06:11.810
So let me consider an
example-- and this is just

01:06:11.810 --> 01:06:16.230
to illustrate the ambiguity--
the example I'll consider

01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:25.550
will be a function f of x, which
is defined to equal plus 1 if x

01:06:25.550 --> 01:06:32.176
is greater than zero, and minus
one if x is less than zero.

01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:37.000
And I have neglected
to specify what

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.437
happens if x is
exactly equal to zero,

01:06:39.437 --> 01:06:41.270
but when you integrate,
that doesn't matter.

01:06:41.270 --> 01:06:42.810
A single point never matters.

01:06:42.810 --> 01:06:44.226
So you could measure
it's anything

01:06:44.226 --> 01:06:46.485
you want at x equals zero,
it won't change anything

01:06:46.485 --> 01:06:47.568
you're going to be saying.

01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:51.600
Let me draw a graph of this.

01:06:57.866 --> 01:07:00.758
f of x versus x.

01:07:00.758 --> 01:07:06.210
I'll put plus 1 there,
and minus 1 there.

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:08.047
The function is plus 1.

01:07:08.047 --> 01:07:09.797
Maybe I have a little
bit of colored chalk

01:07:09.797 --> 01:07:12.060
here to draw the function.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:17.207
The function is plus 1 for
all positive values of x,

01:07:17.207 --> 01:07:20.470
and minus one for all
negative values of x.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:22.470
And there's the function.

01:07:22.470 --> 01:07:24.750
And if we integrate
it symmetrically,

01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:26.680
following this
definition of what

01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:29.786
we mean by integrating from
minus infinity to infinity,

01:07:29.786 --> 01:07:31.160
we do get a perfect
cancellation.

01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:33.060
When you integrate
from minus L to L,

01:07:33.060 --> 01:07:35.720
we get zero, because you
get a perfect cancellation

01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.330
between the negative parts
and the positive parts.

01:07:38.330 --> 01:07:41.250
And then if you take the
limit as L goes to infinity,

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:44.438
the limit of zero is zero.

01:07:44.438 --> 01:07:47.180
There's not really any
ambiguity to that statement.

01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:50.400
So in the order specified,
this has unique integral,

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.230
which is zero.

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:57.610
But, it depends on how you've
chosen to add things up.

01:07:57.610 --> 01:07:59.980
In particular, if you
just change your origin,

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:03.380
and integrate starting moving
outward from the new origin,

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.900
you'll get a different
answer, and that's

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:08.040
what I want to illustrate next.

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:36.020
Suppose-- suppose we
consider the limit

01:08:36.020 --> 01:08:39.810
as L goes to infinity, we'll
pick the limit the same way,

01:08:39.810 --> 01:08:42.229
but instead of integrating
from minus L to L,

01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:51.668
we can integrate from a minus
L to a plus L of f of x dx.

01:08:56.648 --> 01:08:58.189
Now this is really
the same integral,

01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:59.813
we've just basically
changed our origin

01:08:59.813 --> 01:09:01.110
by integrating from a outwards.

01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:03.020
In the special
case a equals zero,

01:09:03.020 --> 01:09:05.140
it's exactly the same
as what we did before,

01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:07.439
but if a is non-zero, it
means that our integral

01:09:07.439 --> 01:09:10.350
is centered about x equals
a, instead of centered

01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:12.600
about x equals zero.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.890
So we can draw that
on the blackboard.

01:09:16.890 --> 01:09:25.700
If we let a be over
here, our integral

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:32.859
will go from a minus
L, and that will

01:09:32.859 --> 01:09:35.620
be to the left of
distance L, you

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:38.220
will extend to a plus L,
which will be to the right

01:09:38.220 --> 01:09:44.560
by distance L. The
integral defined

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:48.040
by the equation on the
blackboard at the left

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:50.346
will correspond to that
region of integration.

01:09:50.346 --> 01:09:52.970
And the specification is that we
should do that interval first,

01:09:52.970 --> 01:09:54.886
and then take the limit
as L goes to infinity,

01:09:54.886 --> 01:09:57.160
and see what we get.

01:09:57.160 --> 01:09:59.730
It's easy to see
what we will get.

01:09:59.730 --> 01:10:05.180
Once L is bigger
than a, you can see

01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:08.710
that the answer won't change
any more, as we make L bigger.

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:10.640
As you make L bigger,
we will always

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:13.460
be adding a certain amount
of minus 1 on the left,

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.210
and certain amount-- the same
amount of plus 1 on the right,

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:21.741
and they will cancel each
other once L is bigger than a.

01:10:21.741 --> 01:10:23.657
And we don't care about
small l, because we're

01:10:23.657 --> 01:10:25.654
only interested in taking
the limit of large L,

01:10:25.654 --> 01:10:27.070
but we should look
at what happens

01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:30.390
when L equals a, and then
from any bigger value of L

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.500
will give us exactly
the same number.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.800
And when L equals
a, the integral

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:41.816
will go from 0 up to
2a-- a plus L which

01:10:41.816 --> 01:10:45.640
is a equals L, so that's 2a.

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:47.735
So the integral will be
only on the positive side,

01:10:47.735 --> 01:10:50.089
and we'll have a
length of 2a, and that

01:10:50.089 --> 01:10:52.130
means the integral will
be 2a, because we're just

01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:54.940
integrating one from 0 to 2a.

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:57.190
And that will be what we get
for any bigger value of L

01:10:57.190 --> 01:10:59.480
also, because as we
increase L, as I said,

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:02.146
we just get a cancellation
between adding more plus 1

01:11:02.146 --> 01:11:06.410
on the right, and adding
more minus 1 on the left.

01:11:06.410 --> 01:11:10.280
So this limit has a
perfectly well defined value,

01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:11.020
which is 2a.

01:11:13.930 --> 01:11:17.502
And a is just where we
chose to start integrating,

01:11:17.502 --> 01:11:18.460
so a could be anything.

01:11:18.460 --> 01:11:19.918
We could choose a
to be anything we

01:11:19.918 --> 01:11:23.500
want if we're free to
integrate in any order.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.880
So we can get any
answer we want,

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.715
if we're free to
integrate in any order,

01:11:26.715 --> 01:11:29.300
to add up the pieces of
this integral in the order

01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:31.050
that we choose.

01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:33.230
And that is a
fundamental ambiguity

01:11:33.230 --> 01:11:36.300
of conditionally
convergent integrals.

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:37.930
And what we'll
see is that trying

01:11:37.930 --> 01:11:41.167
to add up the force on a
particle in an infinite mass

01:11:41.167 --> 01:11:42.542
distribution is
exactly this kind

01:11:42.542 --> 01:11:45.260
of conditionally
convergent integral.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.500
And that's why you get
any answer you want,

01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.300
and it doesn't
really mean anything

01:11:49.300 --> 01:11:53.740
unless you do things
very carefully.

01:11:53.740 --> 01:11:54.830
OK.

01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:56.870
Let's move on.

01:11:56.870 --> 01:11:59.960
We only have a few
minutes left, which

01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:04.370
I guess means I will
set up this calculation,

01:12:04.370 --> 01:12:08.110
but not quite get the answer,
and we'll continue next time.

01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:21.930
I actually have some
diagrams here on my slides.

01:12:26.074 --> 01:12:30.840
What I want to do now,
is calculate the force

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:33.394
on some particle in an
infinite mass distribution,

01:12:33.394 --> 01:12:35.310
and show you that I can
get different answers,

01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.022
depending on what
order I add things up.

01:12:38.022 --> 01:12:40.610
I will add things up in a
definite order at each stage,

01:12:40.610 --> 01:12:43.026
so I will get a definite answer
at each stage, though I'll

01:12:43.026 --> 01:12:46.210
get different answers, depending
on what ordering I choose.

01:12:46.210 --> 01:12:47.664
So, we're going
to start by trying

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.830
to calculate-- and the only
thing [? of interest, ?]

01:12:49.830 --> 01:12:52.810
actually, in calculating
the gravitational force

01:12:52.810 --> 01:12:56.790
on some point, p in an
infinite distribution of mass.

01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:00.740
Mass fills the slide, and
everything, out to infinity.

01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:03.690
And we're going to add up
that mass in contributions

01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:05.695
that are specified.

01:13:05.695 --> 01:13:07.850
And for our first
calculation, we're

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:11.070
going to add up the
forces for masses

01:13:11.070 --> 01:13:13.674
that are defined in
concentric shells, where we're

01:13:13.674 --> 01:13:15.340
going to take the
innermost shell first,

01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:17.173
then the second shell,
then the third shell,

01:13:17.173 --> 01:13:19.710
going outward from the center.

01:13:19.710 --> 01:13:23.630
In that case, it's easy to see
that the force on p calculated

01:13:23.630 --> 01:13:27.190
in that order of
integration is 0,

01:13:27.190 --> 01:13:30.440
because every shell has
p exactly at the center,

01:13:30.440 --> 01:13:33.610
and by symmetry, it
has to cancel exactly.

01:13:33.610 --> 01:13:36.240
In fact, we know-- and we'll
use this fact shortly--

01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.050
that the gravitational field
of a shell, inside the shell,

01:13:40.050 --> 01:13:44.030
is exactly zero-- Newton
figured this out--

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:47.140
and outside the shell, the
gravitational field of a shell

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:50.010
looks exactly the same as the
gravitational field of a point

01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:52.330
mass located at the
center of the shell

01:13:52.330 --> 01:13:53.556
with the same total mass.

01:13:53.556 --> 01:13:55.180
So we're going to be
using those facts.

01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:58.780
And clearly those facts
indicate that, for this case,

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:01.210
the answer is 0.

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:04.320
P equals 0.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:09.352
Now we're going to consider a
more complicated case-- going

01:14:09.352 --> 01:14:12.400
too far, here, don't want
to tell you the answer yet--

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:15.020
this more complicated case,
we're going to still calculate

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:18.340
the force at the
point p, but we're

01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:20.890
going to choose concentric
spherical shells

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.706
which are centered around
a different point, q.

01:14:23.706 --> 01:14:25.330
So q just defines
the shells that we're

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:26.672
going to use for
adding things up,

01:14:26.672 --> 01:14:29.297
and we're still going to add up
all the shells out to infinity,

01:14:29.297 --> 01:14:31.810
so we're going to be
adding up the force on p

01:14:31.810 --> 01:14:34.140
due to the entire infinite
mass distribution,

01:14:34.140 --> 01:14:35.962
but we'll be taking
those contributions

01:14:35.962 --> 01:14:37.420
in a different
order, because we're

01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:39.980
going to be ordering it
according to shells that

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.480
are all centered on q, starting
with the innermost, and then

01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:44.990
the second, and then
the third, and so on.

01:14:44.990 --> 01:14:48.620
Now in this case, we can first
talk about the contribution

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:53.085
of the shaded region, which are
all the shells around q which

01:14:53.085 --> 01:14:57.690
have radii which are less
than the distance to p.

01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:03.590
For all of these shells,
p lies outside the shell.

01:15:03.590 --> 01:15:05.740
And therefore all
of those shells

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:09.680
act just like a point mass,
with the same total mass

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:13.760
concentrated at q, the
center of all those spheres.

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:16.270
So the mass that's
in the shaded region

01:15:16.270 --> 01:15:18.220
will give a contribution
to the force

01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:21.840
at p, which is just equal
to the force of the mass

01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:26.500
given by the same total mass
the point q, located at q.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:29.580
On the other hand,
all the shells outside

01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:32.260
will be shells for
which p is inside.

01:15:32.260 --> 01:15:34.500
P is no longer at the
center of those shells,

01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:38.110
but Newton figured out, and
I'll assume that we all believe,

01:15:38.110 --> 01:15:39.190
it doesn't matter.

01:15:39.190 --> 01:15:41.560
Inside the spherical shell,
the gravitational force

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:43.330
is zero anywhere,
no matter how close

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:44.765
you are to the boundaries.

01:15:44.765 --> 01:15:46.680
It just cancels out perfectly.

01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:48.140
As you get closer
to one boundary,

01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:50.400
you might think you'd be
pulled toward that boundary,

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:53.090
but-- let me just tell you
what's happening here--

01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:54.600
as you get closer
to one boundary,

01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.377
it is true that the
force pulling you

01:15:57.377 --> 01:15:59.960
towards the particular particles
at the boundary get stronger,

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:02.214
because it's 1 over r
squared, but as you get close

01:16:02.214 --> 01:16:04.255
to this boundary, there's
more mass on this side,

01:16:04.255 --> 01:16:06.270
because all the mass
except for a little sliver

01:16:06.270 --> 01:16:07.560
is on the other side.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:10.910
And those two effects
cancel out exactly.

01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:13.980
So the force on a
particle inside a shell

01:16:13.980 --> 01:16:16.970
is exactly zero, as you can
prove very easily by the way,

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:19.772
from the Gauss's law of
formulation of gravity.

01:16:19.772 --> 01:16:21.980
And therefore, the outer
shells give no contribution.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:25.082
So we've completely
calculated now the force at p

01:16:25.082 --> 01:16:27.770
is just equal to the force
due to the shaded mass.

01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:38.275
It's just given by
that simple formula,

01:16:38.275 --> 01:16:40.500
it's g times the total
mass, divided by b squared,

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.850
that would be it's
distance between q and p.

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.330
And it's non-zero.

01:16:45.330 --> 01:16:48.800
So you get 0 or non-zero
answer, depending

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.961
on what ordering you
chose for adding up

01:16:50.961 --> 01:16:52.960
the pieces of the mass
that are going to make up

01:16:52.960 --> 01:16:54.497
this infinite distribution.

01:16:54.497 --> 01:16:56.830
And furthermore, this answer
could be anything you want,

01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:58.538
because I could let
b be anything I want.

01:16:58.538 --> 01:17:00.320
And this answer depends
on b, and becomes

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:03.210
arbitrarily large in
magnitude as b gets bigger.

01:17:03.210 --> 01:17:05.250
The mass grows like b cubed.

01:17:05.250 --> 01:17:06.860
It might look like
it falls with b,

01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:09.050
but actually it grows with b.

01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:10.950
And we could get a
point in any direction,

01:17:10.950 --> 01:17:13.890
by choosing q on any side
we want of p, so we can get,

01:17:13.890 --> 01:17:16.130
really, any answer
we want by using

01:17:16.130 --> 01:17:18.208
this particular way of
adding up the masses.

01:17:18.208 --> 01:17:18.725
Yes.

01:17:18.725 --> 01:17:21.016
AUDIENCE: Well, although we
can get any answer we want,

01:17:21.016 --> 01:17:24.252
every answer [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:24.252 --> 01:17:25.710
PROFESSOR: Every
answer, say again?

01:17:25.710 --> 01:17:27.376
AUDIENCE: Like every
single one of those

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:29.126
answers corresponds to a setup.

01:17:29.126 --> 01:17:33.518
I mean like the g
equals 0, [INAUDIBLE]

01:17:36.637 --> 01:17:38.345
PROFESSOR: Well the
reason it's a problem

01:17:38.345 --> 01:17:40.140
is that these shells
don't really exist.

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:41.765
We're just thinking
about these shells.

01:17:41.765 --> 01:17:43.510
The shells only
determine what order

01:17:43.510 --> 01:17:46.800
we are going to use for adding
up the different contributions.

01:17:46.800 --> 01:17:48.750
The matter is just
uniformly distributed

01:17:48.750 --> 01:17:51.422
and there's no shells present.

01:17:51.422 --> 01:17:53.323
The shells are purely
a mental construct,

01:17:53.323 --> 01:17:55.981
which should not
affect the answer.

01:17:55.981 --> 01:17:58.160
This is not part of the
physical system at all.

01:18:00.885 --> 01:18:02.470
The shells only
reflect the order

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:05.650
that we have used to
add up the masses.

01:18:05.650 --> 01:18:06.484
So we'll stop there.

01:18:06.484 --> 01:18:08.566
If anybody has questions,
we can talk after class,

01:18:08.566 --> 01:18:11.240
and we can talk more about
the question at the beginning

01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:14.870
of the next class, but
class is over for now.

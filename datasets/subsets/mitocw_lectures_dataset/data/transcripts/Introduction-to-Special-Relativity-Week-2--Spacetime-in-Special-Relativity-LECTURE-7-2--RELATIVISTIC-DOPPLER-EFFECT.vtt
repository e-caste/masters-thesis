MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20, Special Relativity.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.710
In this section,
we're going to talk

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.080
about the relativistic
Doppler effect.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.990
And we make good use of
our space-time diagrams,

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.190
which we discussed earlier.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.130
So the situation is as follows--

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.920
to simplify this,
we have a source

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.960
which is emitting pulses.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.550
So the waves are pulses.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.820
Every now and then there is
a beep, and another beep,

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.380
and another beep.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.230
And those pulses travel
with their velocity--

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.650
with their wave velocity.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.570
And they have a world
line represented here

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:40.800
in the space-time diagram.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.640
This is pulse number one,
and this is pulse number two.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.620
The distance between
those two pulses

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.070
is our period, the period of
our wave, which we call tau.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:53.500
The question now is, how
is this being observed

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.530
by an observer which is moving
with a relative velocity

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.350
v with respect to the source?

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.820
So let's analyze this.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.130
So if we want to characterize
or find our position x1 and x2,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.140
we can do this by saying
x1 is equal to ct1

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.590
or equal to x0, which is
the distance of the observer

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.470
to the source plus c times t1.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.430
v is the velocity in which
the source is moving.

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.990
And similarly for t x2, we
find c times t2 minus tau.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.930
And that's also equal
to x0 plus v times t2.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.720
So the distance in time--

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.300
we're still in the reference
frame as of the source--

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.800
is given by c times
tau over c minus v.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.410
And the distance in
space is given by v times

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.990
c times tau over c minus v.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.040
So the question is not
how this observed--

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.330
how this is seen by
the source but how this

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.040
is being seen by the observer.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.470
So we have to apply
Lorentz transformation.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.210
So in the s prime frame,
which is the observer frame,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.650
we find delta t prime is
equal to gamma delta t minus v

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:11.020
over c squared delta x.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.850
And then we just fill
in the information

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:14.065
as we discussed before.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.610
Tau prime is then gamma times
c tau over c minus v times

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.580
1 minus v square over c square.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.180
And then you make use of
delta equal v of over c.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.450
And we make use
of gamma equals 1

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.270
over square root of
1 minus beta square.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.020
And we find then--

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:43.770
this is a little bit of
an algebra exercise here--

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.090
that the period now
is given by 1 plus

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.100
beta over 1 minus beta square
root of that times tau.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.530
And the frequency
is the inverse.

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.770
We'll have 1 minus beta
over 1 plus beta square root

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.990
of that [? times ?]
the frequency.

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.560
So we just calculated
relativistically

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.940
how the period and the
frequency of a wave

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.200
is Lorentz transformed.

00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:04.420
In this segment, we go through
another random incidence

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.710
example, one that does not
involve the Poisson process,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.950
but a much simpler
arrival process.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.860
We do this for two reasons.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.490
One is because of the
simplicity of the example,

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.880
perhaps the intuition will
be a little more transparent.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.170
And the second reason
is to illustrate

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.030
that we're dealing with
a phenomenon that's

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:24.980
not specific to the
Poisson process,

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.850
but is much more general.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.570
The example is as follows.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.060
We have an arrival
process, in which

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.100
arrivals happen at random.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.600
And the consecutive
interarrival times

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.400
are independent, identically
distributed, random variables.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.060
However, unlike the
Poisson process,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.960
these interarrival times are not
exponential random variables.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.940
But instead, we assume
that they are either

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.480
5 or 10 minutes with
equal probability.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.550
So we have an arrival.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.980
The next arrival may
happen five minutes later.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.620
The next arrival may again
happen five minutes later.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.120
Then maybe we get an
interarrival interval of length

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.110
10, then maybe another
interarrival interval of length

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.570
10, followed by one
of five, and so on.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.650
What is the expected value
of the kth interarrival time?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.539
Well, an interarrival time is
with probability 1/2 of length

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.500
five and with probability
1/2 of length 10.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.380
So the average
interarrival time is 7.5.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.940
Now, you show up
at a random time.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.289
And by random we
mean a time that's

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.900
completely uncoordinated
with the arrival process.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.259
You show up at
some point in time,

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.000
and you look at the interarrival
interval in which you fall.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And you're interested
in the length

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of that particular
interarrival interval.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.770
What is the probability that
you fall inside a five minute

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:03.805
interarrival interval?

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.259
Since intervals of
length five are as likely

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.150
as intervals of length
10, in the long run,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.760
there's going to be roughly
as many five minute intervals

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.520
as there will be 10
minute intervals.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.360
On the other hand, the
10 minute intervals

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.750
occupy twice as much
space on the real line.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.570
And for this reason, it
is 2 times more likely

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.320
that you will fall in a
10 minute interval rather

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.500
than a five minute interval.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.720
In other words, the probability
of falling in a five minute

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.160
interval is going to be 1/3.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.500
Whereas the probability of
following in a 10 minute

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.790
interval is going to be 2/3.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.850
For this reason,
the expected length

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.050
of the interarrival
interval that you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.420
get to see when you arrive is
equal to, with probability 1/3,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:55.760
you see a five.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.370
And with probability
2/3, you see a 10.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.400
And this number evaluates
approximately to 8.3,

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.930
which is indeed larger than 7.5.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.330
The conclusion from this
example is similar to the one

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.010
that we had for the
Poisson process.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.500
Although the average
interarrival time

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.280
is 7.5, when you show
up at a random time

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.480
you are more likely to
fall in a larger interval.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.630
And for that reason,
on the average,

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.860
you will be seeing longer
interarrival intervals.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.970
The calculations that we carried
through in that simple example

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.610
can be generalized for
more general arrival

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.180
processes, called
renewal processes.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.300
In a renewal process, once more
the consecutive interarrival

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.060
times are independent,
identically distributed,

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.370
random variables.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.180
But they have a
general distribution.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.380
For this case, there's
a formula again

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.490
that tells us the
length or the expected

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:00.720
length of the interarrival
interval that you get to see.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.610
But the main message
from this example

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.280
is that it does make a
difference how you sample,

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.480
how you choose what to
watch and what to measure.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.080
It makes a difference
whether you

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.190
decide to measure the kth
interarrival time and it's

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.940
average value or to
decide to measure

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.140
an interarrival
time that's chosen

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.170
by showing up at a random time.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.350
The two methods of sampling
give you different results.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.800
And we will see
next a few examples

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.367
that have this
particular flavor.

BARTON ZWIEBACH:
Scattering in dimension.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:18.440
And we will consider
a world that

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.440
is just one dimensional, x.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:32.520
And, in fact, there's an
infinite barrier at x equals 0.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.790
Infinite barrier, nothing
goes beyond there.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.340
On the other hand, in here,
up to some distance R,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:49.100
there could be a
potential V of x.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.930
So we will have a
potential V of x,

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.170
it will have the following
properties-- it will

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.850
be identically 0 for x
greater than R, which

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.940
is the range of the potential;
it will be some function

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:19.590
V of x for x in
between R and 0; and it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.620
will be infinity for x
less than or equal than 0.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:31.210
This is your potential, it's
a potential of range R--

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:32.932
range of the potential.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.630
And the experiment
that we think about

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.350
is somebody at x
equal plus infinity

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.410
throwing waves into
this potential.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:54.180
And this observer can only
get back a reflected wave,

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.220
and from that reflected
wave, the observer

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.590
wants to deduce the type of the
potential that you have there.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.530
And that's absolutely
the way physics

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.620
goes in particle physics.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.760
In LHC, you throw protons
or electrons together

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.130
and you just catch
what flies out

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:18.040
of the collision with
all the detectors

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.310
and read that they
then deduce what

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.830
happened to the collision,
what potential was there,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.240
what forces were there,
was there a new particle?

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.520
It's all found by looking at
what comes out and flies away.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.700
So there's enormous
amount of information

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.660
on the potential from
the data that comes out

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.790
of you throwing
in some particles

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.560
in and waiting to see
what comes back to you.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.340
So we will always have
this infinite wall.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.860
And this infinite
wall at x equals 0

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.560
means that x less than
0 is never relevant.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:05.410
And this is analogous
to R, the variable R

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.330
in radial coordinates for which
the radial distance is never

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.630
negative.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:20.810
So in fact, what we'll do here
has immediate applications when

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.570
we will consider--
not in this course--

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.750
scattering in three dimensions.

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:36.980
So to begin this, we'll solve
the simplest case where you

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.680
have no potential whatsoever.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.610
Now no potential means
still the barrier

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.740
at x equals 0, the
infinite barrier,

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.360
but in between 0 and R,
nothing is happening.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:59.620
So you have just a
case of no potential.

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:10.060
Is the case where you
have the barrier here

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:16.450
and x is over there and up
to R, nothing's happening,

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:18.610
it's just the wall.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:22.220
That's all there
is, just one wall.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.570
So this is V--

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:32.440
no potential is V is
equal to V of x is equal 0

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:37.030
for x greater than 0.

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.020
And it's infinity for x
less or equals than 0.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:52.270
So in this case, let's assume
we have an incident wave.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.050
An incident wave must be
propagating in this way,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.320
so an incident wave is
an e to the minus ikx.

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.504
And if you have
an outgoing wave,

00:05:09.504 --> 00:05:12.685
it would be some
sort of e to the ikx.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.930
These are the only
things that can be there.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:21.530
They correspond to
energy eigenstates,

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.910
this is the de
Broglie wave function

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.470
of a particle with
momentum, in one direction

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.970
or in the other direction.

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.950
But let's combine them in a way
to produce a simple solution.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.855
So this solution, phi of
x, will be the solution.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:50.720
Will be a combination
that's similar--

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:57.550
e to the ikx and e
to the minus ikx,

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.900
and I should make the wave
function vanish at x equals 0.

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:06.820
At x equals 0, both
exponentials are equal to 1,

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.415
so if I want them to cancel,
I should put a minus.

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:18.830
So in order to simplify
this the best possible way,

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:23.760
we can put a 1 over
to 2i's over there

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.810
so that we have a sine
function, and the sine function

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.160
is particularly nice.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:33.150
So we'll have e to the--

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.120
output like this--
e to the minus ikx

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:47.060
plus e to the ikx over 2i, and
this is just the sine function

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.480
side of kx, which
you would admit,

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:55.230
it's a V solution over
here, a sine of kx.

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.920
On the other hand, I can
think of this solution

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:11.120
as having an incoming
wave, which is minus

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:23.605
e to the minus ikx over 2i,
and an outgoing wave of e

00:07:23.605 --> 00:07:27.640
to the ikx over 2i.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:39.440
So this is the representation
of the solution when nothing

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.030
is happening, and the good
thing about this solution

00:07:44.030 --> 00:07:49.700
is that it tells us
what we should write--

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.250
gives us an idea of what
we should write when

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:55.260
something really is happening.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:57.980
So now let's
consider how we would

00:07:57.980 --> 00:08:02.810
write the general
experiment in which you

00:08:02.810 --> 00:08:07.400
send in a wave but this time,
there is really a potential.

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:17.570
So let's consider now, if no
potential was there and now

00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:19.730
yes, potential--

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:31.910
so no potential here, so what
does it mean yes potential?

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:36.799
Well, it means you have this and
you have some potential there

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:39.880
up to some distance R,
and then it flattens out,

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:43.610
and something happens.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.390
So in order to
compare, we'll take

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.140
an incoming wave, the
same as the one where

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:52.870
there was no potential.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:09:02.320
So let's take an incoming
wave, which is of the form e

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:09.980
to the minus ikx
times minus over 2i.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:15.140
But I must say here, I
must write something more--

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:19.340
I must say that x
is greater than R,

00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.890
otherwise this is
not the solution.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.040
You see, in the region
where the potential really

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.360
exists, where the--

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.620
goes up and down, you
don't know the solution.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:33.140
It would take solving
the Schrodinger equation.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:38.180
You know the solution
where the potential is 0,

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.890
so yes, this incoming wave is
the solution of the Schrodinger

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:50.110
equation in this potential
when x is greater than R.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.390
And how about the outgoing wave?

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:02.610
Well, we would like
to write it like that.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:13.530
So we'll say 1 over 2i e to the
ikx is also an outgoing wave,

00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:17.150
and we have no hope
of solving it here,

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.490
finding what's
happening here unless we

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:24.020
solve a complicated equation,
but then let's look outside--

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.670
we're still looking outside.

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:30.480
But that cannot be
the outgoing wave.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.550
This is the same as the other
one and there is a potential,

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:40.380
so something must be different.

00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.740
On the other hand, if
you think about it,

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:47.360
very little can be
different because you

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.870
must have a solution
with 0 potential and--

00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:54.500
you know these plane
waves going out

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.985
are the only things that exist.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:03.940
And now you decide,
oh, if that's the case,

00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:08.930
I cannot put another function
of x in there because that's not

00:11:08.930 --> 00:11:11.340
a solution.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:16.230
The best I can do is
multiply by a number,

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.020
because maybe there's
very little outgoing wave

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.490
or there is not, but then
I think of another thing--

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:27.660
remember if you had e
to the A, e to the minus

00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:39.520
ikx plus B e to the ikx,
well, the probability current

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:45.000
was proportional to A
squared minus B squared.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.390
And this time,
however, you have--

00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:55.250
you're sending in a wave and
you're getting back a wave

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:57.370
and this is a
stationary state-- we're

00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:01.270
trying to get energy eigenstate,
solutions of some energy

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.690
just like this energy.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:09.490
And the only way it can happen
is if they carry the same

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.830
amount of probability--
probability cannot be

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:17.870
accumulating here, nor it can
be depleted there as well,

00:12:17.870 --> 00:12:22.250
so the currents associated to
the two waves must be the same.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:26.450
And the currents are
proportional to those numbers

00:12:26.450 --> 00:12:30.450
that multiply these things
squared, so in fact,

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:37.440
A squared must be
equal to B squared,

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.380
and therefore we cannot
have like a 1/3 here,

00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.850
it would just ruin everything.

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.995
So the only thing I
can have is a phase.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:50.850
It's only thing--
cannot depend on x,

00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:53.300
because that was an
unsolved equation.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:58.170
Cannot be a number that is
less than 1 or bigger than 1.

00:12:58.170 --> 00:13:01.110
The only thing we can
put here is a phase.

00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:06.210
So we'll put an e
to the 2i delta.

00:13:06.210 --> 00:13:10.470
And this delta will depend on
k or will depend on the energy,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.490
and it will depend on
what your potential is,

00:13:14.490 --> 00:13:17.820
but all the information
of this thing

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.780
is in this delta
that depends on k.

00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:27.020
And you say, well, that's
very little, you just

00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:31.500
have one phase, one number that
you could calculate and see,

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.540
but remember, if you
have a delta of k,

00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.300
you could measure it
for all values of k

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.180
by sending particles
of different energies

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:43.780
and get now a whole function.

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:46.760
And with a whole
function delta of k,

00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.110
you have some probability of
getting important information

00:13:51.110 --> 00:13:53.790
about the potential.

00:13:53.790 --> 00:13:58.740
So we'll have a phase there,
e to the i delta of k.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:11.260
And let's summarize here, it's
due to current conservation--

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:14.530
the current of this wave and the
current of the outgoing waves

00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:16.260
should be the same.

00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:24.225
And also note that no extra
x dependents is allowed.

00:14:29.330 --> 00:14:33.610
So this will produce
the J incident

00:14:33.610 --> 00:14:35.890
will be equal to J reflected.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.420
Now you could say, OK, very
good, so there's delta,

00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:43.640
there's a phase--

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:47.070
should I define
it from 0 to 2 pi?

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.500
From minus pi to pi?

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:54.660
It's kind of natural to
define it from minus pi to pi,

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:57.210
and you could look
at what it is,

00:14:57.210 --> 00:15:02.810
but as we will see from another
theorem, Levinson's theorem,

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:05.200
it will be convenient
to just simply say,

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.840
OK, you fixed the phase
delta at k equals 0.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:14.340
At 0 energy scattering, you
read what is your delta--

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.920
unless you increase the
energy, the phase will change.

00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:23.610
So if you have a phase,
for example, on a circle,

00:15:23.610 --> 00:15:30.450
and the phase starts to grow and
to grow and to grow and to grow

00:15:30.450 --> 00:15:36.101
and to go here, well, should you
call this pi and this minus pi?

00:15:36.101 --> 00:15:36.600
No.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.860
You probably should just--

00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:39.810
if it keeps growing
with energy--

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.850
and it might happen,
that the phase

00:15:41.850 --> 00:15:46.650
keeps growing with energy--
well, pi, 2 pi, 3 pi, 4 pi,

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.710
just keep the phase continuous.

00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:53.550
So keeping the phase continuous
is probably the best way

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:55.550
to think about the phase.

00:15:55.550 --> 00:15:57.180
You start at some
value of the phase

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.890
and then track it continuously.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:01.710
There is always a problem
with phases and angles,

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:05.100
they can be pi or minus
pi's the same angle,

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:09.810
but try for continuity in
defining the phase when

00:16:09.810 --> 00:16:11.580
we'll face that problem.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:14.910
So let's write the solution.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:19.070
We have this, so
the total solution.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.980
We call the solution
with no potential phi,

00:16:22.980 --> 00:16:26.370
this one we'll
call psi of x will

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:34.760
be 1 over 2i, the first term--
e to the ikx plus 2i delta minus

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.330
e to the minus ikx.

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:44.700
It's convenient to
pull out of i delta

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:49.600
to make the two terms
have opposite arguments,

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:55.650
so e to the ikx plus
i delta, and-- or e

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:59.250
to the ikx plus
delta parenthesis

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:06.670
minus e to the minus
ikx plus delta.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:15.640
So this is e to the i delta
times sine of kx plus delta.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.200
So that's this full scattered
wave, not the full reflected--

00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:23.130
well, that word again.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:26.550
This is the full
wave that you have

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:32.680
for x greater than R. So let's
write it here-- psi of x.

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.090
It's not the reflected wave
nor that it covers everything.

00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:42.360
We include-- it's
for x greater than R,

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.720
but we include the incoming
and outgoing things,

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.600
because both are defined
for x greater than R,

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.360
so the total wave is this one.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:58.290
And you notice that if
the phase shift is 0,

00:17:58.290 --> 00:18:03.000
you are nicely back to
the wave function phi

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.847
that we found before.

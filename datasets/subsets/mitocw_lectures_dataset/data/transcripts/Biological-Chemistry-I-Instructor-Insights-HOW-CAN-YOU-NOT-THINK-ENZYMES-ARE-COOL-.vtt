JOANNE STUBBE: When I went
to graduate school, which

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.136
was in the late
1960s, I didn't even

00:00:11.136 --> 00:00:13.260
know what an enzyme was,
because back in those days

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.270
I'd never had a biology course.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.720
They didn't do biochemistry
back in those days.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.640
And I think I heard a lecture
by Van Tamelen at Stanford.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.330
He was interested in
steroid structures, steroids

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:33.720
that have four rings and it's
the basis for sex hormones

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.290
and for cholesterol
biosynthesis.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.110
They're all sort of made through
a common biosynthetic pathway

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.820
that we don't really talk about.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.070
These are these
five carbon units

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.860
to form carbon-carbon bonds
that I mentioned earlier.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.650
Anyhow, what he
showed was you could

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.640
take 30 carbon strung
together in a linear form.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.040
And then somehow
these 30 carbons

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.990
folded up with one enzyme
to form these four rings,

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:09.050
putting in eight asymmetric
centers in a single step at pH7

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.790
in 100% yield.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.150
Once I saw that, I said man
I don't want to be a chemist.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.640
If you could see how
nature designed this,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.020
and what is the basis for being
able to make these molecules,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.090
it was sort of mind
boggling to me.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.680
And I think enzymes
are like that.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.510
What they do is they've
evolved for billions of years

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.700
to accelerate rates of reactions
by factors as much as 10

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.530
to the 20th.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.490
So that's really fast,
like a bat out of hell.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.160
And so nature has figured out
how to control all of this.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.700
But again, she has
a limited repertoire

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.890
of reactions that she catalyzes,
but she's extremely good at it.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.590
And so understanding people
have studied enzymes forever

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.130
because I'd like to understand
the basic principles

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.660
of catalysis.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.600
And then if you
understood those,

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.030
can the chemist then
take this understanding

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.255
and translate it into
the bigger repertoire

00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:12.480
of the periodic table
you have to be able to do

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.720
these transformations?

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.130
So the mechanisms of
rate acceleration,

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.990
which we talk about in some
detail in a lecture, what

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.660
causes these catalysts
to work, and the way you

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.550
describe how these
catalysts work.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.440
It doesn't matter
whether you're using

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.040
a small inorganic molecule
or small organic molecules

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.040
or a protein, the
basic principles

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.110
and thinking about catalysis is
exactly the same, except nature

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.410
has figured out how to do this
better than anything man can

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.130
do.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.140
But again, she's
limited in terms.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.020
She's had a billions of years
to evolve these catalysts,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.060
but then she's limited in
the repertoire of reactions

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.310
that she needs to catalyze.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.160
So how can you not
think enzymes are cool?

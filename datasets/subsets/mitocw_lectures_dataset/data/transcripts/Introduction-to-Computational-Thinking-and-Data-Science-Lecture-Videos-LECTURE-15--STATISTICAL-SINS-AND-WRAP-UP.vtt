JOHN GUTTAG: Hello, everybody.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.570
Well, here we are
at the last lecture.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.667
We're going to finish talking
about statistical sins

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:41.250
and then do a little
bit of a wrap-up.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.440
Let's look at a hot topic--

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.350
global fiction-- or global
warming, fact or fiction.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.550
You've done a
problem set related

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.190
to temperatures in the US.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.040
Here is a plot
generally accepted

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.650
of the change in temperatures
on the planet between 1880

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.430
and 2014.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.210
Now, if we look at this plot,
we could see this commits one

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.490
of the statistical sins I
complained about on Monday,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.970
that look where it's
starting the y-axis, way down

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.190
here at 55.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.700
And you remember, I told you to
beware of charts for the y-axis

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.540
doesn't start at 0.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.190
So maybe the people
who are trying

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.910
to claim about global
warming are just deceiving us

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.620
with this trick of the axis.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.970
So here's what happens
when you put it at 0.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.020
And as you can see--

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.690
or barely see-- this axis
runs from 0 up to 110

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.030
as the average temperature.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.710
And as you can
see quite clearly,

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.940
it's hardly changed at all.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.020
So what's the deal here?

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.450
Well, which is a more accurate
presentation of the facts?

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.760
Which conveys the
accurate impression?

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.910
Let's look at another
example, maybe

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.530
a little less controversial
than climate change--

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.630
fever and flu.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.480
It's generally accepted
that when you get the flu

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.790
you might run a fever.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.440
So here is someone
who had the flu.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.680
And this is plotting their fever
from the beginning to its peak.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.380
And it does appear, if we
were to fit a curve to this,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.920
it would look pretty
much like that.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.560
On the other hand, if we assume
that somebody's temperature

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.334
could range between
0 and 200, we

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:44.500
can see that, in fact, your
temperature doesn't move

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.280
at all when you get the flu.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.550
So the moral is
pretty clear, I think.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.690
Even though on Monday I talked
about being suspicious when

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.040
people start the
y-axis too far from 0,

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.020
you should truncate
it to eliminate

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.680
totally preposterous values.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.510
No living person
has a temperature

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.540
of 0 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.090
So again, don't truncate it
just to make something look

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.000
like it isn't, but don't
expand it to deceive either.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.420
Let's return to global warming.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.040
This is a chart
that was actually

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.920
shown on the floor
of the US Senate

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.970
by a senator from Texas,
who I shall not name.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.190
And obviously, the
argument here was

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.610
that, well, sure global
warming bounces up and down.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:53.220
But if we go back, we can
see here, the date is 19--

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.970
can we see it?

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.240
I can see it.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.050
Maybe 1986, I think.

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.970
You can see that
the argument here

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.630
is, in fact, if you fit a trend
line to this, as he's done,

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.670
it hasn't changed at all.

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.140
And so even though we've had
a lot of carbon emissions

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.070
during this period,
maybe global warming

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.709
is not actually happening.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.371
This is in contradiction to
the trend I showed before.

00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:26.910
Well, what's going on here?

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:33.140
This is a very common way that
people use statistics poorly.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.400
They confuse
fluctuations with trends.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.880
What we see in any
theories of data--

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.040
time series, or other series--

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.580
you always have fluctuations.

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.580
And that's not to be
confused with the trend.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.460
And in particular, what you
need to think about when you're

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.310
looking at a
phenomenon is choose

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.860
an interval consistent with the
thing that's being considered.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.050
So we believe that
climate change

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.910
is something that happens over
very long periods of time.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.860
And it's a little bit
silly to look at it

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.260
on a short period of time.

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.120
Some of you may
remember two years ago,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.017
we had a very cold winter here.

00:05:20.017 --> 00:05:21.850
And there were people
who were saying, well,

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:24.650
that shows we don't
have global warming.

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.340
Well, you can't really conclude
anything about climate change

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.880
looking at a year, or
probably not even looking

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:33.530
at 10 years or 20 years.

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.860
It's a very slow phenomenon.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.600
On the other hand,
if you're looking

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.270
at the change in
somebody's heart rate,

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.310
seeing if they have
a heart condition,

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:46.330
you probably don't want to look
at it over a 10-year period.

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:48.100
So you have to decide
what you're doing

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.780
and find an interval that lets
you look at the trends rather

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.180
than the fluctuations.

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.090
Any rate, maybe even if we're
having global warming, at least

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:02.660
the Arctic ice isn't
melting, though apparently,

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.580
I read in the paper this morning
they found a huge crack in it.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.400
So this was reported
in the Financial Post

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.750
on April 15, 2013.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.070
You can read it yourself.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.510
But the basic
import of it is they

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:29.900
took the period from April
14, 1989 to April 15, 2013

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.010
and said, look,
it's not changing.

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:41.250
In fact, the amount of
arctic ice is unchanged.

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:42.880
Well, what's the financial--

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.090
not the financial-- what's
the statistical sin being

00:06:46.090 --> 00:06:46.930
committed here?

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:56.580
If we look at this data,
this is an anomaly chart.

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:59.520
I think you saw one of these
in one of the problems sets,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.860
where you fix
something at 0 and then

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.340
you show fluctuations
relative to that.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.574
So here, it's the Arctic
ice relative to a point.

00:07:10.574 --> 00:07:16.160
And what we see here is
that if you go and choose

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.380
the right date--

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:30.110
say this one in 1989--

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:38.390
and you come over here and you
choose the right date in 2013--

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:45.570
say this one-- you can then
draw a line and say, oh, look,

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:46.325
it hasn't changed.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:52.460
This is something
people frequently do,

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:56.570
is they take a
whole set of data,

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:59.960
and they find two points that
are consistent with something

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.140
they believe.

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.560
And they draw a line
between those two points,

00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:09.477
fit a curve to those two points,
and draw some conclusion.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.490
This is what we
call cherry picking,

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:17.290
I guess from the
notion that when

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:20.800
you go to pick cherries you only
want to pick the right ones,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.080
leave the others to ripen
for a bit on the tree.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:28.615
It's really bad.

00:08:28.615 --> 00:08:30.240
And it's something
that, unfortunately,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.010
the scientific literature
is replete with,

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:35.720
where people look
at a lot of data,

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.220
and they pick the points that
match what they want to prove.

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:43.610
And so as you can see, while
the trend is quite clear,

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:47.420
you could prove almost anything
you wanted by selecting

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.130
two points very carefully.

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.470
I could also show
that it's crashing

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.660
much faster than people think it
is by picking these two points.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.410
If I wanted to argue
that it's catastrophic,

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:03.030
I'd pick those two points
and say, look at that,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:06.960
it's disappearing at
an incredible rate.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:10.170
So you can lie in either
direction with this data

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:11.520
by careful cherry picking.

00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:18.500
As a service to you, I know
the holidays are coming

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.590
and many of you have not bought
presents for your parents,

00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:25.470
so here's a modest
gift suggestion,

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.920
that the family that shoots
together something or other.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:34.630
Well, all right, so we can
ask, is this a good gift?

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.150
Well, probably.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:37.830
We can look at this statistic.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.750
It's not dangerous at least.

00:09:39.750 --> 00:09:43.440
We see that 99.8% of
the firearms in the US

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.850
will not be used to
commit a violent crime.

00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:50.360
So guns apparently are not
actually dangerous, or at least

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.990
not in the hands of criminals.

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:56.120
Well, let's look at this.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.530
How many privately owned
firearms are there in the US?

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:03.532
And anyone want to guess
who hasn't looked ahead?

00:10:03.532 --> 00:10:04.508
Yeah.

00:10:04.508 --> 00:10:05.972
AUDIENCE: 400 million.

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:07.580
JOHN GUTTAG: 400 million.

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:11.210
340 million people
and 400 million guns

00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:15.350
is the guess, more
than one per person.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.540
You certainly are the
right order of magnitude.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:21.800
I think it's about 300 million,
but it's hard to count them.

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:25.890
Maybe this doesn't
count water pistols.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:30.930
So if you assume there
are 300 million firearms

00:10:30.930 --> 00:10:35.170
and 0.2% of them
are used to commit

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:38.960
a violent crime
in every year, we

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.630
see that how many
crimes is that?

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:45.540
600,000.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:49.800
So in fact, it's
not necessarily very

00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.480
meaningful to say
that most of them

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.210
are not used to commit a crime.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:57.600
Well, let's look
at another place

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.380
where we look at a statistic.

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:05.580
Probably most of you don't even
remember the scary swine flu

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:08.370
epidemic.

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:10.800
This was a big headline.

00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.050
And people got so
scared of the swine flu

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:16.230
they were doing things
like closing schools

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.110
to try limit the
spread of the flu.

00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:21.900
New York City closed some
schools because of it,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:23.520
for example.

00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:26.860
So is this a scary statistic?

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:31.610
Well, maybe, but here's
an interesting statistic.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.220
How many deaths per year
are from the seasonal flu

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:35.610
in the US--

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:39.470
the ones we try and
prevent with a flu shot?

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.260
36,000.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.180
So what we see is that, it
doesn't make a lot of sense

00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:52.950
to panic over 159 in the
light of this number.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:00.220
So the point here for
both this and the issue

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:04.300
about the firearms is
that context matters.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.480
Yeah, I love this cartoon.

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:16.790
A number without context
is just a number.

00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:20.330
And numbers by themselves
don't mean anything.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.720
So to say that there were
159 deaths from the swine flu

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.830
is not very meaningful
without some context.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:32.330
To say that only
0.2% of firearms

00:12:32.330 --> 00:12:34.610
are used to commit
a violent crime

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.580
is not very meaningful
without context.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.580
Whenever you're
presenting a statistic,

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:42.230
reading about a
statistic, and you just

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.750
see a number that
seems comforting

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:48.920
or terrifying, try and put
some context around it.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:56.300
So a related thing
is relative to what?

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:59.540
Suppose I told you that
skipping lectures increases

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:04.410
your probability of
failing this course by 50%.

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:07.650
Well, you would all feel
great, because you're here.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:10.470
And you would be laughing at
your friends who are not here,

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:14.880
because figuring that will leave
much better grades for you.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.520
What does this mean, though?

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:22.310
Well, if I told
you that it changed

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:28.060
the probability of failing
from a half to 0.75,

00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.300
you would be very tempted
to come to lectures.

00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.550
On the other hand, if I told you
that it changed the probability

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:42.869
from 0.005 to 0.0075, you
might say, the heck with it,

00:13:42.869 --> 00:13:43.910
I'd rather go to the gym.

00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:49.500
Again this, is an issue.

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:53.070
And this is something that we
see all the time when people

00:13:53.070 --> 00:13:57.440
talk about percentage change.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.510
This is particularly prominent
in the pharmaceutical field.

00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:09.180
You will read a headline saying
that drug x for arthritis

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:16.980
increases the probability of
a heart attack by 1% or 5%.

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:18.810
Well, what does that mean?

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.860
If the probability was already
very low, increasing it by 5%,

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.620
it's still very low.

00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.150
And maybe it's worth it not
to be in pain from arthritis.

00:14:30.150 --> 00:14:34.440
So talking in
percentages is, again,

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.010
one of these issues of
it doesn't make sense

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.300
without the context.

00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.000
In order to know
what this means,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.880
I need to know what regime
I'm in here in order

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.420
to make a intelligent decisions
about whether to attend lecture

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:50.470
or not.

00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:55.180
It goes without saying, you have
all made the right decision.

00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:58.350
So beware of
percentage change when

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.020
you don't know the denominator.

00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:03.210
You get a percentage by
dividing by something.

00:15:03.210 --> 00:15:05.760
And if you don't know
what you're dividing by,

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:09.180
then the percentage is
itself a meaningless number.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.220
While we're sort of talking
about medical things,

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.640
let's look at cancer
clusters to illustrate

00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:26.090
another statistical question.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:29.970
So this is a definition of a
cancer cluster by the CDC--

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.160
"a greater-than-expected
number of cancer cases

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.370
that occurs in a group of
people in a geographic area

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.210
over a period of time."

00:15:39.210 --> 00:15:41.280
And the key part
of this definition

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:44.370
is greater-than-expected.

00:15:48.090 --> 00:15:54.870
About 1,000 cancer clusters per
year are reported in the US,

00:15:54.870 --> 00:15:57.060
mostly to the Centers
for Disease Control,

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:01.940
but in general to
other health agencies.

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:08.200
Upon analysis, almost none
of them pass this test.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:12.460
So the vast majority,
some years all of them,

00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:14.915
are deemed actually not
to be cancer clusters.

00:16:18.406 --> 00:16:20.530
So I don't know if-- has
anyone here seen the movie

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.210
Erin Brockovich?

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:25.790
Subsequent analysis showed
that was actually not

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:26.750
a cancer cluster.

00:16:29.790 --> 00:16:35.450
It's a good movie, but turns
out statistically wrong.

00:16:35.450 --> 00:16:37.400
This, by the way, is
not a cancer cluster.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.010
This is a constellation.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.310
So let's look at a
hypothetical example.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:46.190
By the way, the other
movie about cancer clusters

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:48.590
was the one set
in Massachusetts.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:49.340
What was the name?

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:50.120
A Civil Action.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.190
Anyone see that?

00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:53.000
No.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.380
That was a cancer cluster.

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.230
Massachusetts is about
10,000 square miles.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.290
And there are about 36,000
cancer cases per year

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.020
reported in Massachusetts.

00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:08.730
Those two numbers are accurate.

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:12.369
And the rest of this
is pure fiction.

00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:16.900
So let's assume that we had
some ambitious attorney who

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:22.550
partitioned the state into 1,000
regions of 10 square miles each

00:17:22.550 --> 00:17:25.069
and looked at the
distribution of cancer cases

00:17:25.069 --> 00:17:29.000
in these regions trying to find
cancer clusters that he or she

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.120
could file a lawsuit about.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.740
Well, you can do
some arithmetic.

00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.910
And if there are 36,000
new cancer cases a year

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.420
and we have 1,000
regions, that should

00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:47.150
say that we should
get about 36 cancer

00:17:47.150 --> 00:17:50.540
cases per year and per region.

00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.410
Well, when the attorney
look at the data,

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:56.530
this mythical
attorney, he discovered

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:01.960
that region number
111 had 143 new cancer

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:05.240
cases over a three-year period.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.870
He compared that to 3
times 36 and said, wow,

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:11.630
that's 32% more than expected.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.220
I've got a lawsuit.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:16.780
So he went to tell
all these people--

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:18.540
they lived in a cancer cluster.

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.570
And the question is,
should they be worried?

00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:28.850
Well, another way to look at the
question is, how likely is it

00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:32.510
that it was just bad luck?

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:34.430
That's the question
we've always ask when

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:36.920
we do statistical analysis--

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.820
is this result meaningful, or
is it just random variation

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.590
that you would expect to see?

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:50.370
So I wrote some code to simulate
it to see what happens--

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:55.620
so number of cases,
36,000, number of years, 3.

00:18:55.620 --> 00:19:00.150
So all of this is just the
numbers I had on the slide.

00:19:00.150 --> 00:19:02.880
We'll do a simulation.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.920
We'll take 100 trials.

00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:09.690
And then what I'm going to
do is for t in the range

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:14.300
number of trials, the locations,
the regions, if you will,

00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:19.470
I'll initialize each to 0,
1,000 of them, in this case.

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:22.290
And then for i in the
range number of years

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:28.740
times number of cases per year,
so this will be 3 times 36,000.

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:34.510
At random, I will assign the
case to one of these regions.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:36.550
This is the random.

00:19:36.550 --> 00:19:40.280
Nothing to do with cancer
clusters, just at random,

00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.200
this case gets assigned to
one of the 1,000 regions.

00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:55.600
And then I'm going to check if
region number 111 had greater

00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:01.030
than or equal to 143, the number
of cases we assumed it had.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:05.080
If so, we'll increment the
variable num greater by 1,

00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:11.850
saying, in this trial of 100,
indeed, it had that many.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.580
And then we'll see how
often that happens.

00:20:14.580 --> 00:20:20.040
That will tell us how improbable
it is that region 111 actually

00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:20.940
had that many cases.

00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:25.676
And then we'll print it.

00:20:25.676 --> 00:20:27.820
Does that makes
sense to everyone,

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.970
that here I am
doing my simulation

00:20:30.970 --> 00:20:36.160
to see whether or not how
probable is it that 111

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:39.230
would have had this many cases?

00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.870
Any questions?

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:42.500
Let's run it.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.150
So here's the code
we just looked at.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.840
Takes just a second.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:17.310
That's why I did only 100
trials instead of 1,000.

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:20.100
I know the suspense
is killing you.

00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:20.899
It's killing me.

00:21:20.899 --> 00:21:22.440
I don't know why
it's taking so long.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:29.830
We'll finish.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.560
I wish I had the Jeopardy
music or something

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:37.977
to play while we
waited for this.

00:21:37.977 --> 00:21:40.060
Anna, can you home some
music or something to keep

00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.340
people amused?

00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.964
She will not.

00:21:43.964 --> 00:21:44.463
Wow.

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:49.550
So here it is.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.980
The estimated
probability of region 111

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.570
having at least 1 case--

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:00.920
at least 143 cases--

00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:13.390
easier to read if I
spread this out is 0.01.

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:18.110
So it seems, in fact, that
it's pretty surprising--

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:20.020
unlikely to have
happened at random.

00:22:22.990 --> 00:22:23.710
Do you buy it?

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.240
Or is there a flaw here?

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.070
Getting back to
this whole question.

00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:33.548
Yes.

00:22:33.548 --> 00:22:36.726
AUDIENCE: I think it's
flawed because first off you

00:22:36.726 --> 00:22:38.438
have to look at the population.

00:22:38.438 --> 00:22:39.416
That is more important.

00:22:39.416 --> 00:22:41.372
JOHN GUTTAG: You
have to look at what?

00:22:41.372 --> 00:22:45.284
AUDIENCE: Population as opposed
to like the number of areas,

00:22:45.284 --> 00:22:48.218
because when you get past the
Boston area, you'd expect a--

00:22:48.218 --> 00:22:50.510
JOHN GUTTAG: Let's assume
that, in fact, instead of

00:22:50.510 --> 00:22:52.060
by square miles--

00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.700
let's assume the
populations were balanced.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.324
AUDIENCE: Then I also
think it's flawed

00:22:56.324 --> 00:22:59.691
because I don't think the
importance of block 111

00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:01.615
having 143 is important.

00:23:01.615 --> 00:23:04.510
I think the importance is just
one area having a higher--

00:23:04.510 --> 00:23:07.960
JOHN GUTTAG: Exactly right.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.050
Exactly right.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.720
I'm sorry, I forgot
my candy bag today.

00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.720
Just means there'll be
more candy for the final.

00:23:26.690 --> 00:23:34.960
What we have here is a
variant of cherry picking.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.780
What I have done
in this simulation

00:23:37.780 --> 00:23:41.120
is I've looked at 1,000
different regions.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.520
What the attorney did
is, not in a simulation,

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.490
is he looked at 1,000
different regions,

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.690
found the one with the most
cancer cases, and said,

00:23:54.690 --> 00:23:57.030
aha, there are too many here.

00:24:01.530 --> 00:24:06.130
And that's not what I
did in my simulation.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:08.650
My simulation didn't
ask the question,

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:11.410
how likely is it that there
is at least one region

00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:13.480
with that many cases.

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.060
But it asked the
question, how likely is it

00:24:16.060 --> 00:24:20.400
that this specific region
has that many cases.

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:24.750
Now, if the attorney had reason
in advance to be suspicious

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.750
of region 111, then
maybe it would have

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.910
been OK to just go check that.

00:24:29.910 --> 00:24:32.190
But having looked at
1,000 and then cherry

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:36.400
pick the best is not right.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:41.410
So this is a simulation
that does the right thing.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:47.640
I've left out the
initialization.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.390
But what you can
see I'm doing here

00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:52.160
is I'm looking at the
probability of there

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.220
being any region that
has at least 143 cases.

00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:06.910
What this is called in the
technical literature, what

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:11.220
the attorney did is multiple
hypothesis checking.

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:15.450
So rather than having a single
hypothesis, that region 111 is

00:25:15.450 --> 00:25:20.430
bad, he checked 1,000
different hypotheses,

00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:25.380
and then chose the one
that met what he wanted.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:27.780
Now, there are good
statistical techniques

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.770
that exist for dealing with
multiple hypotheses, things

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.530
like the Bonferroni correction.

00:25:34.530 --> 00:25:37.350
I love to say that name.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:41.370
But you have to worry about it.

00:25:41.370 --> 00:25:59.690
And in fact, if we
go back to the code

00:25:59.690 --> 00:26:14.710
and comment out this
one and run this one,

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:16.720
we'll see we get a
very different answer.

00:26:42.190 --> 00:26:44.890
The answer we get is--

00:26:44.890 --> 00:26:47.580
let's see.

00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:48.450
Oh, I see.

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:52.670
All right, let me
just comment this out.

00:27:02.970 --> 00:27:04.220
Yeah, this should work, right?

00:27:15.951 --> 00:27:17.700
Well, maybe you don't
want to wait for it.

00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.730
But the answer you'll
get is that it's actually

00:27:20.730 --> 00:27:22.380
very probable.

00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:26.520
My recollection is it's a
0.6 probability that at least

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:29.400
one region has that many cases.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.924
And that's really
what's going on

00:27:30.924 --> 00:27:32.340
with this whole
business of people

00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:34.830
reporting cancer clusters.

00:27:34.830 --> 00:27:38.040
It's just by accident,
by pure randomness,

00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.600
some region has
more than its share.

00:27:43.290 --> 00:27:49.890
This particular form
of cherry picking

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:53.100
also goes by the name of the
Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:59.230
I don't know why people
pick on Texas for this.

00:27:59.230 --> 00:28:00.880
But they seem to.

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.280
But the notion is, you're
driving down a road in Texas

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.080
and you see a barn with a bunch
of bullet holes in the wall

00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.740
right in the middle of a target.

00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:16.360
But what actually happened
was you had a barn.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.850
The farmer just shot some
things at random at the barn,

00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.910
then got out his paint brush and
painted a target right around

00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.220
where they happened to land.

00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:29.270
And that's what happens when
you cherry pick hypotheses.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:36.920
What's the bottom line of all
these statistical fallacies?

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.700
When drawing inferences from
data, skepticism is merited.

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.440
There are,
unfortunately, more ways

00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.336
to go wrong than to go right.

00:28:46.336 --> 00:28:48.210
And you'll read the
literature that tells you

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:51.120
that in the scientific
literature more than half

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.070
of the papers were
later shown to be wrong.

00:28:56.070 --> 00:28:59.040
You do need to remember that
skepticism and denial are

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.090
different.

00:29:00.090 --> 00:29:01.680
It's good to be skeptical.

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:06.390
And I love Ambrose Bierce's
description of the difference

00:29:06.390 --> 00:29:08.050
here.

00:29:08.050 --> 00:29:10.080
If you had never
read Ambrose Bierce,

00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.920
he's well worth reading.

00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.770
He wrote something called
The Devil's Dictionary,

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:18.670
among other things, in which
he has his own definition

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:19.720
of a lot of words.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:25.030
And he went by the
nickname Bitter Bierce.

00:29:25.030 --> 00:29:28.300
And if you read The Devil's
Dictionary, you'll see why.

00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.790
But this, I think, has
a lot of wisdom in it.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.390
Let's, in the remaining few
minutes, wrap up the course.

00:29:37.390 --> 00:29:40.790
So what did we cover in 6.0002?

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:43.630
A lot of things.

00:29:43.630 --> 00:29:47.750
If you look at the technical,
things were three major units--

00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:51.950
optimization problems,
stochastic thinking,

00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:56.300
and modeling aspects
of the world.

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.330
But there was a big
subtext amongst all of it,

00:29:59.330 --> 00:30:01.750
which was this.

00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:06.220
There was a reason our problem
sets were not pencil and paper

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.940
probability problems,
but all coding.

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.562
And that's because
we really want,

00:30:13.562 --> 00:30:15.020
as an important
part of the course,

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.310
is to make you a
better programmer.

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.670
We introduced a few
extra features of Python.

00:30:21.670 --> 00:30:24.970
But more importantly,
we emphasized

00:30:24.970 --> 00:30:29.090
the use of libraries, because
in the real world when

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:33.710
you're trying to build things,
you rarely start from scratch.

00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:35.150
And if you do
start from scratch,

00:30:35.150 --> 00:30:37.600
you're probably
making a mistake.

00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.490
And so we wanted to get you
used to the idea of finding

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:42.500
and using libraries.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:45.530
So we looked at plotting
libraries and machine

00:30:45.530 --> 00:30:49.250
learning libraries
and numeric libraries.

00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:51.792
And hopefully, you
got a lot of practice

00:30:51.792 --> 00:30:53.750
in that you're a way
better programmer than you

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:57.230
were six weeks ago.

00:30:57.230 --> 00:30:59.370
A little more detailed--

00:30:59.370 --> 00:31:04.960
the optimization problems,
the probably most important

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:08.420
takeaway is that many
important problems

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.320
can be formulated in terms of
an objective function that you

00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:18.250
either maximize or minimize
and some set of constraints.

00:31:18.250 --> 00:31:20.980
Once you've done
that, there are lots

00:31:20.980 --> 00:31:23.110
of toolboxes, lots
of libraries that you

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:26.150
can use to solve the problem.

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.440
You wrote some
optimization code yourself.

00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.340
But most of the time, we
don't solve them ourselves.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.250
We just call a built-in
function that does it.

00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:37.310
So the hard part is
not writing the code,

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:38.930
but doing the formulation.

00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:44.410
We talked about
different algorithms--

00:31:44.410 --> 00:31:48.790
greedy algorithms,
very often useful,

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:53.510
but often don't find
the optimal solution.

00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:57.690
So for example, we looked
at k-means clustering.

00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:01.020
It was a very efficient
way to find clusters.

00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.880
But it did not necessarily find
the optimal set of clusters.

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:10.360
We then observed that
many optimization problems

00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.120
are inherently exponential.

00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:18.270
But even so, dynamic
programming often

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:24.750
works and gives us a
really fast solution.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:27.690
And the notion here is this is
not an approximate solution.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.270
It's not like using
a greedy algorithm.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:34.900
It gives you an exact solution
and in many circumstances

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:37.700
gives it to you quickly.

00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:39.590
And the other thing I
want you to take away

00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:43.610
is, outside the context
of dynamic programming,

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:47.610
memoization is a generally
useful technique.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:53.790
What we've done there is
we've traded time for space.

00:32:53.790 --> 00:32:56.130
We compute something, we
save it, and when we need it,

00:32:56.130 --> 00:32:58.130
we look it up.

00:32:58.130 --> 00:33:02.670
And that's a very common
programming technique.

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.590
And we looked at a lot
of different examples

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:08.130
of optimization-- knapsack
problems, several graph

00:33:08.130 --> 00:33:12.390
problems, curve fitting,
clustering, logistic

00:33:12.390 --> 00:33:14.070
regression.

00:33:14.070 --> 00:33:17.280
Those are all
optimization problems,

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.980
can all be formulated as
optimization problems.

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:26.560
So it's very powerful
and fits lots of needs.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:28.770
The next unit--
and, of course, I'm

00:33:28.770 --> 00:33:31.050
speaking as if these things
were discrete in time,

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:32.540
but they're not.

00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:34.860
We talked about optimization
at the beginning.

00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.830
And I talk to an
optimization last week.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:41.250
So these things were sort
of spread out over the term.

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.890
We talked about
stochastic thinking.

00:33:43.890 --> 00:33:48.600
And the basic notion here is
the world is nondeterministic,

00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:51.690
or at least predictably
nondeterministic.

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.850
And therefore, we need
to think about things

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:59.260
in terms of probabilities most
of the time, or frequently.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.430
And randomness is a powerful
tool for building computations

00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:05.230
that model the world.

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.720
If you think the
world is stochastic,

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.909
then you need to have
ways to write programs

00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:11.920
that are stochastic,
if you're trying

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.429
to model the world itself.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:18.300
The other point we made is
that random computations--

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:21.719
randomness is a
computational technique--

00:34:21.719 --> 00:34:24.239
is useful even for
problems that don't appear

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:26.429
to involve any randomness.

00:34:26.429 --> 00:34:29.219
So we used it to
find the value of pi.

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:32.310
We showed you can use
it to do integration.

00:34:32.310 --> 00:34:34.110
There's nothing
random about the value

00:34:34.110 --> 00:34:36.360
of the integral of a function.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:39.389
Yet, the easiest way to
solve it in a program

00:34:39.389 --> 00:34:42.030
is to use randomness.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.090
So randomness is a
very powerful tool.

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:48.409
And there's this whole
area of random algorithms--

00:34:48.409 --> 00:34:50.850
research area and
practical area that's

00:34:50.850 --> 00:34:56.280
used to solve
non-probabilistic problems.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:35:01.270
Modeling the world-- well, we
just talked about part of it.

00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:02.850
Models are always inaccurate.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:07.390
They're providing some
abstraction of reality.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:11.205
We looked at
deterministic models--

00:35:11.205 --> 00:35:12.205
the graph theory models.

00:35:12.205 --> 00:35:14.680
There was nothing
nondeterministic

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:18.130
about the graphs we looked at.

00:35:18.130 --> 00:35:21.460
And then we spent more
time on statistical models.

00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.200
We looked at simulation models.

00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:25.690
In particular, spent
quite a bit of time

00:35:25.690 --> 00:35:28.360
on the Monte Carlo simulation.

00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.460
We looked at models
based on sampling.

00:35:33.940 --> 00:35:37.420
And there-- and also when
we talked about simulation--

00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:42.130
I really hope I emphasized
enough the notion

00:35:42.130 --> 00:35:45.220
that we need to be
able to characterize

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.790
how believable the results are.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:50.620
It's not good enough
to just run a program

00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:53.210
and say, oh, it has an answer.

00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:56.780
You need to know whether
to believe the answer.

00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:01.280
And the point we made is
it's not a binary question.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:04.910
It's not yes, it's
right, no, it's wrong.

00:36:04.910 --> 00:36:10.790
Typically, what we do is we have
some statement about confidence

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:14.360
intervals and confidence levels.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:16.610
We used two
variables to describe

00:36:16.610 --> 00:36:18.260
how believable the answer is.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.390
And that's an important thing.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:25.376
And then we looked at tools
we use for doing that.

00:36:25.376 --> 00:36:27.000
We looked at the
central limit theorem.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.440
We looked at the empirical rule.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.230
We talked about
different distributions.

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:33.150
And especially, we spent
a fair amount of time

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.290
on the normal or
Gaussian distribution.

00:36:37.290 --> 00:36:39.750
And then finally, we looked
at statistical models

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.600
based upon machine learning.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:45.840
We looked at
unsupervised learning,

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.050
basically just clustering,
looked at two algorithms--

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:51.360
hierarchical and k-means.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:53.970
And we looked at
supervised learning.

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:57.240
And there, we essentially
focused mostly

00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.700
on classification.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:01.260
And we looked at
two ways of doing

00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:05.082
that-- k-nearest neighbors
and logistic regression.

00:37:08.530 --> 00:37:14.080
Finally, we talked about
presentation of data--

00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.620
how to build plots,
utility of plots,

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:21.010
and recently, over the last
two lectures, good and bad

00:37:21.010 --> 00:37:24.330
practices in presenting
results about data.

00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:29.490
So my summary is,
I hope that you

00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:32.400
think you've come a long way,
particularly those of you--

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.350
how many of you were
here in September when

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.910
we started 6.0001?

00:37:36.910 --> 00:37:39.980
All right, most of you.

00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:42.390
Yeah, this, by the way,
was a very popular ad

00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:45.780
for a long time, saying that,
finally women are allowed

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.570
to smoke, isn't this great.

00:37:48.570 --> 00:37:51.480
And Virginia Slims sponsored
tennis-- the women's tennis

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.260
tour to show how good it
was that women were now

00:37:55.260 --> 00:37:56.880
able to smoke.

00:37:56.880 --> 00:38:01.380
But anyway, I know not everyone
in this class is a woman.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.340
So just for the men
in the room, you too

00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.540
could have come a long way.

00:38:09.830 --> 00:38:12.050
I hope you think
that, if you look back

00:38:12.050 --> 00:38:15.230
at how you struggled in
those early problems sets,

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:17.960
I hope you really feel that
you've learned a lot about how

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.270
to build programs.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:22.874
And if you spend enough
time in front of a terminal,

00:38:22.874 --> 00:38:24.290
this is what you
get to look like.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.780
What might be next?

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.630
I should start by saying,
this is a hard course.

00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:34.850
We know that many
of you worked hard.

00:38:34.850 --> 00:38:38.990
And the staff and I
really do appreciate it.

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:42.530
You know your return
on investment.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.560
I'd like you to remember
that you can now write

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.410
programs to do useful things.

00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:51.860
So if you're doing a UROP,
you're sitting in a lab,

00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:55.490
and you get a bunch of data from
some experiments, don't just

00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:56.210
stare at it.

00:38:56.210 --> 00:38:58.730
Sit down and write
some code to plot it

00:38:58.730 --> 00:39:00.990
to do something useful with it.

00:39:00.990 --> 00:39:06.344
Don't be afraid to write
programs to help you out.

00:39:06.344 --> 00:39:08.260
There are some courses
that I think you're now

00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.840
well-prepared to take.

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:16.490
I've listed the ones I know
best-- the courses in course 6.

00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:20.770
6.009 is a sort of introduction
to computer science.

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.690
I think many of you
will find that too

00:39:22.690 --> 00:39:25.210
easy after taking this course.

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.900
But maybe, that's
not a downside.

00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:33.620
6.005 is a software
engineering course,

00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:36.440
where they'll switch
programming languages on you.

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.750
You get to program in Java.

00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:45.220
6.006 is a algorithms
course in Python

00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:47.590
and I think actually
quite interesting.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:49.480
And students seem
to like it a lot,

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:53.080
and they learn about algorithms
and implementing them.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:58.270
And 6.034 is an introduction
to artificial intelligence

00:39:58.270 --> 00:39:59.380
also in Python.

00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:03.880
And I should have listed
6.036, another introduction

00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:05.690
to machine learning in Python.

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.130
You should go look for
an interesting UROP.

00:40:14.130 --> 00:40:16.050
A lot of students come
out of this course

00:40:16.050 --> 00:40:18.270
and go do UROPs,
where they use what

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.100
they've learned in this course.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:24.100
And many of them really have
a very positive experience.

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.570
So if you were worried that
you're not ready for a UROP,

00:40:27.570 --> 00:40:29.220
you probably are--

00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:31.890
a UROP using what's
been done here.

00:40:31.890 --> 00:40:33.730
You can minor in
computer science.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:36.840
This is now available for
the first time this year.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.730
But really, if
you have time, you

00:40:38.730 --> 00:40:40.640
should major in
computer science,

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:44.160
because it is really the
best major on campus--

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.290
not even close, as
somebody I know would say.

00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:51.120
Finally, sometimes
people ask me where

00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.040
I think computing is headed.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.070
And I'll quote one of my
favorite baseball players.

00:40:56.070 --> 00:41:00.660
"It's tough to make predictions,
especially about the future."

00:41:00.660 --> 00:41:02.520
And instead of my
predictions, let

00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:05.760
me show you the predictions
of some famous people.

00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.270
So Thomas Watson, who
was the chairman of IBM--

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:12.120
a company you've
probably heard of--

00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:14.970
and he said, "I think there is
a world market for maybe five

00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:17.160
computers."

00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:18.660
This was in response
to, should they

00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:22.530
become a computer company,
which they were not at the time.

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:24.330
He was off by a little bit.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.070
A few years later,
there was an article

00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:33.880
in Popular Mechanics, which was
saying, computers are amazing.

00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:35.700
They're going to
change enormously.

00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:39.510
Someday, they may be no
more than 1 and 1/2 tons.

00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:43.230
You might get a computer that's
no more than 3,000 pounds--

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:44.520
someday.

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.770
So we're still waiting
for that, I guess.

00:41:51.250 --> 00:41:52.100
I like this one.

00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.580
This is, having written
a book recently,

00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.420
the editor in charge of
books for Prentice Hall.

00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:00.207
"I traveled the length and
breadth of this country

00:42:00.207 --> 00:42:01.540
and talked with the best people.

00:42:01.540 --> 00:42:05.050
And I can assure you that
data processing is a fad that

00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:09.060
won't last out the year."

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:11.100
MIT had that
attitude for a while.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:15.030
For about 35 years, computer
science was in a building

00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:20.080
off campus, because they weren't
sure we were here to stay.

00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.190
Maybe that's not why, but
that's why I interpret it.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:26.950
Ken Olsen, an MIT graduate--

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:30.280
I should say, a
course 6 graduate--

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.700
was the founder and
president and chair

00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:37.870
of Digital Equipment
Corporation, which in 1977 was

00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:42.250
the second largest computer
manufacturer in the world based

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.914
in Maynard, Massachusetts.

00:42:44.914 --> 00:42:46.330
None of you have
ever heard of it.

00:42:46.330 --> 00:42:47.390
They disappeared.

00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:50.140
And this is in part
why, because Ken said,

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:54.370
"there's no reason anyone would
want a computer in their home,"

00:42:54.370 --> 00:43:00.760
and totally missed that
part of computation.

00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:05.890
Finally, since this is the
end of some famous last words,

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:09.280
Douglas Fairbanks,
Sr., a famous actor--

00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:11.710
this is true-- the last
thing he said before he died

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:13.090
was, "never felt better."

00:43:16.170 --> 00:43:18.320
Amazing.

00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:22.400
This was from the movie
The Mark of Zorro.

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.390
Scientists are better.

00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:28.030
Luther Burbank, his last words
were, I don't feel so good.

00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:30.890
And well, I guess not.

00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:34.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.470
And this is the last one.

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:41.640
John Sedgwick was a Union
general in the Civil War.

00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:42.680
This is a true story.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:46.220
He was riding behind
the lines and trying

00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:53.250
to rally his men
to not hide behind

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:57.720
the stone walls but to stand
up and shoot at the enemy.

00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:02.040
And he said, "they couldn't hit
an elephant at this distance."

00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:06.030
Moments later, he was
shot in the face and died.

00:44:06.030 --> 00:44:07.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:10.560
And I thought this was
an apocryphal story.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:13.170
But in fact, there's a
plaque at the battlefield

00:44:13.170 --> 00:44:15.960
where this happened,
documenting this story.

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:17.790
And apparently, it's quite true.

00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:22.980
So with that, I'll
say my last words

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:26.520
for the chorus, which is I
appreciate all your coming.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:29.500
And I guess you
were the survivors.

00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.980
So thank you for being here.

00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:36.230
[APPLAUSE]

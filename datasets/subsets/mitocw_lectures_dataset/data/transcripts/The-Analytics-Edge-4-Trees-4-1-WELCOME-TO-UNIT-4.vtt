Hello.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.760
This week we'll be discussing
the application of analytics

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.820
into very different
areas-- the Supreme Court

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.740
and health care cost prediction.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.850
In the first lecture,
we'll discuss

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:18.960
how the decisions of the
United States Supreme Court

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.510
can be predicted before the
case even gets to the court.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.060
In the second lecture,
we'll discuss the story

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.500
of D2Hawkeye, a medical
data-mining company I have been

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000
involved with for
several years that

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.320
use analytics to gain an edge.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.990
Through these examples,
we'll introduce the method

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.260
of classification and regression
trees, a very interpretable

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.700
analytics method.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.710
Let's get started.

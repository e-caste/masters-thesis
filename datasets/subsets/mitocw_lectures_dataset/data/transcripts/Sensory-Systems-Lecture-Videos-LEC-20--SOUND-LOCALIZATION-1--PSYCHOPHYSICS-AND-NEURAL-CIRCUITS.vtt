00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.730
PROFESSOR: Last
time we were talking

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:34.980
about descending auditory
pathways and the brainstem

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.520
reflexes, which
are, in some sense,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.970
part of those
descending pathways.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.520
And especially how
they protect our sense

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.590
of hearing from damage.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.440
So I had a question
about subway noise

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.850
on the Red Line in Boston.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.030
And I was asking
around at my hospital

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.300
and nobody seems to
have measured it.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.840
But I saw online that there
were some measurements

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.370
of subway noise
in New York City.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.870
And that it can
actually be damaging

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.099
if you get exposed to
it for long enough.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:09.310
So there's a little news
clipping about subway noise.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.880
So I don't ride the
Red Line very often.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.010
I ride a commuter train
from Lincoln, where I live,

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.570
to North Station.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.580
And when that train comes
in and puts on its brakes,

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.915
it's incredibly shrill.

00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.700
And I always plug my years.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.420
And about half the people
do and the other half

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.574
have hearing loss, I
guess, or whatever.

00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:31.990
It's not really a
laughing matter.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.630
So any questions from last time?

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.710
Of course, the brainstem
reflexes we were talking about

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.980
are also good for
other functions,

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:50.300
like reducing the
effects of noise masking,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.410
allowing selective attention,
those types of functions.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.930
I also have experimental
evidence in support of them.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.340
So if there aren't
questions from last time,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.620
we are going to shift
gears a little bit

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.110
and talk about something
completely different, which

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.593
is sound localization.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.400
And so today's
roadmap is titled--

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.240
headlined-- "Sounds
Localization."

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.620
And we're going to be talking
about the kind of localization

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.275
using binaural cues,
where you have two ears.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.100
And because you have two ears
and because sound sources

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.250
are located off your
midline for the most part,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.120
we have some very prominent
cues called Interaural Time

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.330
Differences, ITDs, and
Interaural Level Differences,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.830
ILDs.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.450
OK, so we'll talk about what
those are, how big they are.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.260
We'll talk about performance
for localizing sounds in humans.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.025
How good are we at
doing that task?

00:03:09.785 --> 00:03:11.076
We'll have some demonstrations.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.260
One of them I'm going to
give you in the room here

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.120
and the other three demos we'll
have to listen to in headphones

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.170
because we want to use just one
of these cues, interaural time

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.900
or interaural level differences.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.100
And for the most part in a room,
in an ordinary environment,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.690
they're mixed up together.

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:36.550
They come together.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.050
But using headphones
we can isolate and play

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.020
just one or the other.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.380
Then, we'll launch into
the neural processing

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:52.530
of one of these cues, ITDs, in
a part of the superior olivary

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.325
complex called the Medial
Superior Olive, or the MSO.

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.350
And so just a
heads up here, last

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:05.460
lecture we were talking about
the neurons in the olive called

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.250
the medial
olivocochlear neurons.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.710
Those are completely different.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.480
They have nothing to do
with sound localization.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:16.149
So those were the MOC neurons.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.439
And today, we're talking
about MSO neurons.

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:20.730
These are completely different.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.690
They're neurons in a major part
of the superior olive called

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.490
the medial superior
olive because it's

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.350
in the medial part.

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:31.540
And then finally, we'll
end up with a discussion

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.750
of the assignment.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.720
We have a written
assignment for audition

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.980
that's due in a few weeks.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.610
But it is based, in large
part, on today's lecture.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.500
So it talks about the model of
neural processing in the MSO.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.790
And another heads up.

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.530
I've added a tiny little bit
to the end of the assignment.

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.360
And we'll talk about
what I've added.

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.460
And that revised
assignment is now

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.090
posted on the course website.

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:03.250
We'll talk about that at
the end of today's class.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.110
So sound localization
using binaural cues.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.250
What are the two cues?

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.920
Well, they're the
interaural time differences

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.170
and interaural
level differences.

00:05:17.176 --> 00:05:21.890
And this subject,
cat, is listening

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.840
to this sound source
at the black dot.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.280
The sound source
is emitting sound.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:35.020
And because sound doesn't travel
instantaneously through air,

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.670
the sound located off to
the right of the subject

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:40.590
strikes the subject's
right ear first,

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.810
and then there's a
little bit of time

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.040
before it gets around
to the left ear, which

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:47.445
is pointed away from the source.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.040
OK, so if this sound source is
emitting a click as diagrammed

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:57.170
here, so this y-axis could
be the sound pressure

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:04.270
level at the subject's
right and left eardrums

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.700
as a function of time.

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.510
This is the time axis.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.240
So obviously, the sound
source is off to the right.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.591
The right ear is going to
receive the sound pressure

00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:13.090
first.

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.730
And then a little bit
later, the left ear

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:19.430
will receive the sound source.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.030
I mean, will receive
the click sound.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:28.930
If the sound emitted is, instead
of a click, a continuous wave,

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:29.950
like a sinusoidal wave.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.140
It'll be delayed the same
amount right versus left.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.710
So here's the right ear
sound pressure level,

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:41.480
and then here is
the delayed version

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.440
that appears at
the left eardrum.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.230
Just a delayed version.

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.550
So how much is the delay?

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:55.110
Well, it depends on things like
the velocity of sound in air.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:57.890
Sound in air.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:00.875
I think we had this in
the very first lecture.

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:09.355
340 meters per second in air.

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:21.740
Now, it depends a little bit
on the temperature of the air.

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:24.820
And it depends a little bit
on the barometric pressure,

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.295
but these factors
change at less than 1%.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:31.670
So about 340 meters
per second in air.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:39.480
So knowing how many meters
between the right and left ear,

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.185
you can calculate for various
positions of the sound source

00:07:44.185 --> 00:07:46.800
the interaural time difference.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.640
Now, if you have a big head,
so that the left and right ears

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.470
are separated very far
apart, obviously you're

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.430
going to get a bigger
interaural time difference

00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:58.100
than if you have a
tiny, little head.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.990
Like a mouse sort or a bat.

00:08:00.990 --> 00:08:05.240
The smallest animals
have very close eardrums,

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.365
so they have very small
interaural time differences.

00:08:10.970 --> 00:08:12.920
OK, now a couple
other things I should

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:15.540
say about both of these
cues, interaural time

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.550
differences and interaural
level differences,

00:08:18.550 --> 00:08:22.120
is they help us detect
where the sound is coming

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:27.520
from in the azimuthal plane,
which is the horizontal plane.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.710
So here's a schematic
of a person's head

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:32.000
with the left ear.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.250
This is the front of the head.

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:36.830
And the right ear is
behind, so you can't see it.

00:08:36.830 --> 00:08:41.020
And so azimuth is in
the horizontal plane.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.580
And that's where
interaural time difference

00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:45.580
changes as a
function of position.

00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.190
The other plane perpendicular to
that is the plane of elevation.

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:55.060
So for me going straight
up and straight down

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.970
is the elevation of
the sound source.

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.740
And you can imagine if there's
a sound source straight ahead,

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.000
it's going to strike my two
eardrums at the same time

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.900
because the path length from
the source to the eardrums

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.610
is the same.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:11.450
And if that sound
source moves up

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.770
from being straight
ahead to, say,

00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:15.640
elevated from straight ahead.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:21.200
But still, it's in the same
place relative to the eardrums.

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.630
The path from the sound
source to the two eardrums

00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:26.210
is going to be the same.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:31.310
So the ITD does not change
as a function of sound source

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:31.810
elevation.

00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:38.860
So these binaural cues that
we're talking about here

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.460
do not change as a
function of elevation.

00:09:41.460 --> 00:09:47.110
So how do we detect the change
in elevation of a sound source?

00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:49.170
Well, we talked
earlier in the course.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:51.370
I think in the
very first lecture

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:57.280
about the so-called
"pinna" cues.

00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:05.970
And so we have these
external ears, the pinnae.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:11.160
And they help us
greatly in detecting

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:16.250
sounds that differ in
elevation because they

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:21.830
put onto the sound spectrum some
very prominent peaks and nulls.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:24.350
And those peaks and nulls
change as a function

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.235
of sound elevation.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.930
So go back to the very first
lecture that I gave you

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:31.310
and review that.

00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:37.100
And we read a paper where if you
distort the pinnae by putting

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:40.230
little plastic or clay
ear molds in your pinnae,

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:42.790
your detectability
of sound sources that

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.640
change in elevation goes to pot.

00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:47.110
You can't do it anymore.

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:53.200
But if you go out and
re-experience sound

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.810
with those little
distortions of your pinnae

00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:58.030
and come back in
a few weeks, you

00:10:58.030 --> 00:11:01.620
can re-learn how
to detect changes

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:02.760
in sound source elevation.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:07.870
And in those kinds of
things, two comments.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:10.080
Number one, you
don't need two ears.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.000
You can detect change in
sound source elevation

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.085
with just one ear, because
one ear has a pinna

00:11:16.085 --> 00:11:18.520
and it works just
fine in changing

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.310
the spectrum from one ear.

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:25.740
And number two, your
sensitivity to small changes

00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.620
in sound source elevation
is not very good.

00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:33.970
So if you change the sound
source elevation of 10 degrees,

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:37.010
most people cannot
detect that change.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.975
The minimum changes in sound
elevation that are detectable

00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:45.360
are more like 30 degrees,
which is a pretty big change.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.810
We'll see using the binaural
cues to detect changes

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:56.890
in sound source azimuth,
we're down to about one degree

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.232
using these binaural cues.

00:11:58.232 --> 00:11:59.190
So they're much better.

00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:00.980
You're much more
accurate in terms

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.595
of localizing sound in azimuth
than you are in elevation.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.610
Secondly, I should
have mentioned here

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:18.220
when we had this time delay
for the ongoing signal,

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:24.130
like a sinusoid wave, that
is equivalent to a phase

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:24.630
difference.

00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.320
The phase is what
engineers use to define

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:35.045
where and when a sinusoidal
source starts and ends.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.770
So engineers talk
about a sinusoid

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:43.710
going through a 360 degree
phase for one cycle.

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:54.060
And so this sinusoid is
delayed about a quarter cycle

00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:56.540
relative to the right ear one.

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.550
And so it has a phase
lag or a phase difference

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.305
of about 90 degrees.

00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:08.560
So you can talk about
interaural phase differences

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.950
for continuous waveforms,
like sinusoids.

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:14.170
And you talk about them
in terms of the number

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:17.130
of degrees of phase difference.

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:21.010
And of course, to convert
from one to the other you

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:24.060
need to know the frequency
that you're talking about.

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:27.940
Because if you're dealing with
a high-frequency sinusoid that

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.360
goes back and forth
a lot of times,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.050
you have to know that to
calculate the interaural time

00:13:35.050 --> 00:13:36.210
difference.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:38.190
But some of our demos
that we listened to

00:13:38.190 --> 00:13:41.980
will quote the interaural
delay in terms of phase.

00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:43.315
An interaural phase difference.

00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:50.879
Now, the second cue is
interaural level difference.

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:52.045
And here's the same subject.

00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:53.595
Here's the same sound source.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.390
The sound is coming to
the subject's right ear

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.400
and it's a high level
there because there's

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:00.255
a direct pathway.

00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:05.470
But the sound to get to
the left ear of the subject

00:14:05.470 --> 00:14:08.910
has to go around
the subject's head.

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.380
And sound does
bend around a wall.

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.684
So I can go out in the
hall and I can say, class,

00:14:16.684 --> 00:14:17.600
can you still hear me?

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.390
Yes, you can still
hear me, right?

00:14:19.390 --> 00:14:20.692
The sound is bending around.

00:14:20.692 --> 00:14:22.150
Of course, some of
it's reflecting.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:25.430
Sound bends around,
but some sound

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:29.930
bends around more easily and
more effectively than others.

00:14:29.930 --> 00:14:32.680
And obviously, this
sound bent around.

00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.450
There's still sound at
the subject's left ear.

00:14:35.450 --> 00:14:38.780
This should actually be
delayed because it took longer.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:42.840
But the purpose here is
that it's lower in amplitude

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.770
and it's not vanishingly small.

00:14:44.770 --> 00:14:47.755
So there's less sound over
the subject's left ear.

00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:51.070
And this is the interaural
level difference.

00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:55.080
This interaural
level difference,

00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.900
as we'll see in just a
minute, depends greatly

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:58.770
on sound frequency.

00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.000
Such that very
low-frequency sounds,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.260
because they have
a long wavelength

00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.230
relative to the object
they're bending around.

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.650
Because of their
physical characteristics,

00:15:11.650 --> 00:15:13.310
they bend around very well.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.300
And so the interaural level
difference, as we'll see,

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.835
is almost 0 for low frequencies.

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.980
For very high
frequencies, there's

00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.240
a big, so-called sound shadow.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.440
They don't bend around
an object the size of the

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.170
had very easily.

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:34.470
And so there's a big
interaural level difference

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.100
for high frequencies.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.950
So we think of these cues
then as being very important

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:41.000
for high frequencies.

00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:46.750
So let me just note
that down here.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:52.830
So ILDs-- I'll use
a different color.

00:15:55.286 --> 00:15:55.786
Important.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.810
And let me show you some
data to support that then.

00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:15.870
These are some data taken for
the two cues for a human head.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:18.840
And how do we get these data?

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.730
Well, we can take
two small microphones

00:16:22.730 --> 00:16:25.230
and put them down in our
ear canals very close

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:26.040
to our eardrums.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:30.410
And we can measure the time
difference and the level

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:30.910
difference.

00:16:30.910 --> 00:16:33.230
And so if you were
to do this, you'd

00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:36.220
seat a subject in
an anechoic room.

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.270
An anechoic room is one that
doesn't have any echoes coming

00:16:39.270 --> 00:16:40.610
off the walls and the ceilings.

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.430
So that the subject just
experiences the direct sound

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.020
from whatever sound source.

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.020
And the sound source we're
going to move around.

00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:54.290
So this x-axis is the
sound source position

00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:56.790
in angles from directly ahead.

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.100
So directly ahead is 0.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:03.930
And higher angles is off,
let's say, to one side.

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:07.664
And directly off to
the side is 90 degrees.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:13.060
And then behind the subject
is greater than 90 degrees.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.760
And directly behind the
subject will be 180 degrees.

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.819
So this is degrees of
azimuth from directly ahead.

00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:25.560
This top graph shows you the
interaural time differences

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.790
and the bottom graph shows
you the interaural level

00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:28.290
differences.

00:17:30.410 --> 00:17:34.365
So how do we compute time
from the microphone signals?

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:44.310
Well, we simply
take our microphones

00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:48.130
and run them to an oscilloscope.

00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:49.200
So here's the head.

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:59.590
Here's microphone 1 in the
ear canal on the left side.

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:02.105
Here's microphone 2 in the
ear canal on the right side.

00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:10.825
You send the wires from those
two signals to an oscilloscope.

00:18:12.570 --> 00:18:15.740
The top channel
will be the signal

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:17.055
coming from the left side.

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.590
The lower channel is the signal
coming from the right side.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:23.710
And this device,
the oscilloscope,

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:26.890
plots the voltage, which is
equivalent to the pressure

00:18:26.890 --> 00:18:28.120
as a function of time.

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:34.160
And we can measure the
time when this sound starts

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:40.670
and the delay, or
interaural time difference,

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:42.860
when the second ear starts.

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:44.170
So it's very simple to measure.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:50.070
Now that said, it's
also very simple

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.460
to assume that the human
head is just a sphere.

00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:58.520
And it's simple
to compute knowing

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.230
the distance
between the two ears

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:01.900
and the angle of
the sound source.

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:07.270
It's very simple to assume that
this human head is a sphere.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:10.700
And I think this solid line
is assuming it's a sphere.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:17.040
And the dashed line with x's
are the experimental data.

00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.050
The data are pretty
close to the assumption

00:19:20.050 --> 00:19:24.320
that the human head is a
sphere for interaural time

00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.190
differences.

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:30.330
And here's the ITD plotted
as a function of the angle.

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:34.230
As you would expect if the
sound source is straight ahead--

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:37.690
that is 0 degrees
angle-- the ITD is 0.

00:19:38.970 --> 00:19:42.320
The sound takes the same
time to get to the two ears

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:44.000
because it's straight ahead.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.060
Now as you move the
sound over to one side,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.475
it's going to get to one
ear first and the other ear

00:19:50.475 --> 00:19:51.840
a little bit later.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.610
And so the ITD
becomes bigger than 0.

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:57.830
And it goes up.

00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:59.660
And the maximal
ITD, as you would

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:01.580
expect when the
sound is directly off

00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:03.800
to the side, which
is at 90 degrees.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:07.720
And what are the units here?

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:14.220
You probably can't read them,
but they go from 0 to 0.6.

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.026
And those units
are milliseconds.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:33.540
So the ITDs go from
0 to 0.6 milliseconds

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.740
for the human head.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:38.760
So millisecond is a
thousandth of a second.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.710
It's pretty small.

00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:44.210
It's less than 1 millisecond
for the maximum ITD.

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.590
And so you can quote this in
terms of microseconds as well.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:51.330
So this would be a
total, a maximal ITD

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:52.416
of 600 microseconds.

00:20:55.255 --> 00:20:55.755
OK.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.675
Now, how about interaural
level differences?

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.950
They are in the lower panel.

00:21:09.950 --> 00:21:12.550
And these are all
measured values.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:13.425
They're not computed.

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.840
I don't know why, you
could compute them easily.

00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:20.050
Maybe it's because of the pinna.

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:24.030
The pinna introduces
another piece of complexity

00:21:24.030 --> 00:21:25.980
that's a little bit
different from the head

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:27.455
being an absolute sphere.

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:30.390
So these are measured.

00:21:30.390 --> 00:21:34.090
And these are, again, plotted
as a function of the azimuth.

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:38.480
0 degrees is straight ahead,
90 degrees is off to one side,

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:42.090
and 180 degrees of azimuth
is behind the subject.

00:21:43.230 --> 00:21:46.915
And these, I said the
ILDs depend on frequency.

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:50.009
So these are separate
plots for a bunch

00:21:50.009 --> 00:21:51.050
of different frequencies.

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:55.910
Down at the bottom is a very
low frequency, 200 Hertz.

00:21:58.050 --> 00:22:01.300
This is our standard
center of the human hearing

00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:03.730
range, 1,000 Hertz.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.370
And this is a very
high frequency

00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.540
at the top, 6,000 Hertz.

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.250
And as you can see quite
clearly, a 200 Hertz,

00:22:12.250 --> 00:22:15.930
like I said before,
this frequency of sound

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:19.830
bends around very
nicely for objects

00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:21.720
the size of the human head.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.350
And so even if you have the
sound source all the way

00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:29.227
to the right, The ILD
for 200 Hertz is 0.

00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.830
You don't have an
ILD, essentially,

00:22:32.830 --> 00:22:34.065
for such low frequencies.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:39.080
For our mid-human
hearing frequency,

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.770
the ILD starts out
at 0, straight ahead,

00:22:42.770 --> 00:22:48.336
and climbs to perhaps 6 or 8 dB.

00:22:48.336 --> 00:22:50.660
As the sound source
moves off to the side,

00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.610
it's not behaving
like a perfect sphere.

00:22:53.610 --> 00:22:55.130
So a perfect sphere,
the ILD would

00:22:55.130 --> 00:22:58.050
go up and be maximal
at 90 degrees.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.670
So maybe this is the
effect of the pinna.

00:23:00.670 --> 00:23:04.020
This is not doing that, but
it's certainly climbing.

00:23:06.850 --> 00:23:10.590
The biggest ILD is found at
these highest frequencies.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:14.422
So for 6,000 Hertz,
the ILD climbs from 0

00:23:14.422 --> 00:23:18.120
up to an ILD of
20 dB as the sound

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.835
is located off to one side.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:26.730
And that's a huge cue for
localization of sounds.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:30.760
So maybe you can remember
back to the very first

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:35.200
of my lectures, where we had
the decibel demonstration.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.675
We changed decibel levels.

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:40.010
I think this was a
noise that we presented

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.720
in changing steps of 6 dB.

00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:44.770
And it was clearly
obvious when you

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:50.180
change-- this is now
binaural level at 6 dB.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.760
3 dB changes in noise
level were obvious.

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:59.480
A 1 dB change in noise
level as we stepped through

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.980
was obvious after you'd
gone through a few steps.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:06.185
But maybe from one to the
next step was not obvious.

00:24:07.310 --> 00:24:10.770
Clearly, a 20 dB difference
between the two ears

00:24:10.770 --> 00:24:11.770
is a huge cue.

00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:18.160
How can we confirm
that that's a huge cue?

00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:22.704
Well, we can take a these
cues and present them

00:24:22.704 --> 00:24:23.495
through headphones.

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:28.950
And it's very easy
to set up a circuit

00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:33.160
so that you have a signal
coming into the two headphones.

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:35.410
And in one channel,
you put a device

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:39.050
called an attenuator that
attenuates the signal.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:42.540
So why not use an amplifier
that amplifies the signal?

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.320
Well, amplifiers
are active devices.

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:48.629
And if you amplify
sounds, inevitably you

00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:49.920
add a little bit of distortion.

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.340
So it's easier to just
attenuate the sound.

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.120
Attenuators are
passive devices and you

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.840
can cut the sound
to one channel 20 dB

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.780
and it sounds like
a huge effect.

00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:02.810
And you say, oh, wow.

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:04.310
That sound disappeared
in one ear.

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:06.060
It sounds like it's
coming from the other.

00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:09.790
You can cut the sound
by 6 dB, a huge effect.

00:25:09.790 --> 00:25:12.610
Cut it by 3 dB, a big effect.

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:14.550
And you cut it by
1 dB and the person

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.175
says, well, before when the
sound was the same in the two

00:25:17.175 --> 00:25:19.030
ears, the sound
was straight ahead.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.370
When you changed it 1 dB,
it sounded like it just

00:25:21.370 --> 00:25:23.320
moved a little bit
from straight ahead.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:30.546
So it turns out that 1 dB is not
only our just detectable level

00:25:30.546 --> 00:25:34.010
in sounds when we present
them to the two ears,

00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:37.340
but when we vary the
interaural level difference.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:49.890
So 1 dB is our just
noticeable difference for ILD.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.920
OK, we can play that
trick with headphones.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:56.828
Do good tests on that.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:05.420
So clearly, these cues are very
important at high frequencies

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:07.470
because they're
the salient cues.

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:08.980
What about at low frequency?

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:12.680
Since we don't have an
interaural level difference,

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.800
you would assume that we're
going to use interaural time

00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:17.350
differences at low frequencies.

00:26:17.350 --> 00:26:18.990
And you'd be correct.

00:26:18.990 --> 00:26:21.160
Much of the evidence
suggests that ITDs

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.510
are used at low
frequencies and ILDs,

00:26:25.510 --> 00:26:27.690
because they're big at
high frequencies-- those

00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.450
are the cues used there.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.290
And why don't we use
ITDs at high frequencies?

00:26:34.330 --> 00:26:40.310
OK, there is nothing in the
physical characteristics

00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.810
of sound.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:46.040
For example, the sound velocity
doesn't depend on frequency.

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:49.545
It's constant no matter what
the frequency of the sound.

00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.754
So you're going to get the
same ITD for low frequencies

00:26:54.754 --> 00:26:55.795
and for high frequencies.

00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.190
Well, if you think
about it a little bit,

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:03.580
there is a reason where
high-frequency ITDs

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.515
are less useful.

00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.730
At some frequencies,
this sound waveform

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:15.150
is going to go back
and forth so quickly

00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:16.910
that it might hit the right ear.

00:27:18.110 --> 00:27:21.220
And then by the time it
leaks around to the left ear,

00:27:21.220 --> 00:27:22.990
it goes through
a complete cycle.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.550
Then, what are we left with?

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:30.785
We're left with right and
left looking exactly the same.

00:27:32.050 --> 00:27:37.170
There's a big time difference,
an interaural phase difference

00:27:37.170 --> 00:27:39.490
of 360 degrees.

00:27:39.490 --> 00:27:41.190
But we'll never be
able to perceive

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.970
that because the
sound is, again,

00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:45.335
the same at the two ears.

00:27:46.850 --> 00:27:49.790
And it turns out,
of course, that

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.790
depends on how widely
spaced your ears are.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:58.750
For the size of a
human head, the phase

00:27:58.750 --> 00:28:00.990
goes completely
through one cycle

00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:06.415
at a frequency of 1.6 kilohertz.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:11.690
And that's pretty centered
in your hearing range.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:14.410
1 kilohertz is about the
middle of your hearing range.

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:15.790
1.6 is pretty close.

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:24.423
So above 1.6 kilohertz,
ITDs become ambiguous.

00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:33.590
And so we think of that as
the time where ITDs fall out

00:28:33.590 --> 00:28:36.280
and ILDs become important.

00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:46.940
So ITDs are ambiguous for
humans above 1 kilohertz.

00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:53.165
Now, that argument, of course,
is for ongoing interaural time

00:28:53.165 --> 00:28:53.665
differences.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:57.190
If you start the sound,
no matter what frequency,

00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:59.135
you're going to have
an onset difference.

00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.635
You can start a 2
kilohertz sound.

00:29:05.016 --> 00:29:07.640
The left ear will get it first,
and then the right ear a little

00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.350
bit later, depending
on where it's

00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:12.870
located and the degree of
separation of your two ears.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.010
But that's just one cue.

00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:19.070
And if these things are repeated
back and forth thousands

00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:21.180
of times, depending
on how long they're

00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.160
on for, for low-frequency
sounds you'll

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.560
get those thousands of cues.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.560
But for high frequencies,
you'll just get the onset.

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:39.430
So for high frequencies, we
think of these frequencies

00:29:39.430 --> 00:29:43.570
as not being useful for
ITDs for these ongoing cues,

00:29:43.570 --> 00:29:45.125
like interaural
phase differences.

00:29:47.470 --> 00:29:48.705
OK, is that clear?

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:50.590
Any questions?

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:54.565
All right.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:00.690
Let's see how good we are
in terms of performance.

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:07.010
Sound localization is
accurate and humans

00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:08.615
have excellent performance.

00:30:10.662 --> 00:30:12.120
How do we measure
such performance?

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.203
Well, we take an observer.

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:18.270
We sit them down in a
room or in free field

00:30:18.270 --> 00:30:21.110
where there's only the
direct sound coming

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:22.290
from the sound source.

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:25.690
And no reflections off
the walls or echoes

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:26.880
off the ceiling or floor.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:31.250
And we say to this
observer, OK, here's

00:30:31.250 --> 00:30:32.990
the sound directly ahead.

00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:35.810
And then we move
the sound source.

00:30:35.810 --> 00:30:38.370
And this can be a
physical speaker.

00:30:38.370 --> 00:30:40.470
We move the speaker
over a little bit

00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:41.760
and so we change azimuth.

00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:50.155
And we ask the person, was
that azimuth detectable?

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:56.690
We say, is that the same or
different from straight ahead?

00:30:56.690 --> 00:30:59.790
So if straight ahead is here
and we move the speaker over

00:30:59.790 --> 00:31:04.000
to here and we say to the
person, same or different?

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.830
Same position or
different position?

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:08.830
And the person says, yeah, sure.

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:09.570
That's different.

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:12.770
And then we instead say,
OK, straight ahead is here

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.140
and we're going to move it less.

00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.840
The person says, sure,
I can detect that.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:17.370
No problem.

00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.665
It moved off to the right.

00:31:18.665 --> 00:31:21.250
And this is, again,
without any visual cues.

00:31:21.250 --> 00:31:23.205
So the speaker has to
be behind a screen.

00:31:24.270 --> 00:31:26.510
So it's only auditory
cues that allow

00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:29.010
you detect this
change in movement.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:31.130
So we do it a third
time, straight ahead,

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:35.580
and we move it such a small
degree that the person says,

00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:37.580
I don't hear that change at all.

00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.440
And we titrate the
level of movement

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:46.930
until we get what's called
the minimum audible angle

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:47.575
in degrees.

00:31:50.030 --> 00:31:52.670
And we can do that for a whole
bunch of different frequencies.

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:59.550
And when we do that
with sound sources,

00:31:59.550 --> 00:32:03.400
such that the initial position
is 0 degrees straight ahead,

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.350
we get this curve linked
by the black dots.

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:13.630
Such that at low frequencies,
the minimum audible angles

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:15.385
approach, in the
best performance,

00:32:15.385 --> 00:32:17.245
1 degree of azimuth.

00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:21.160
An observer can
tell the difference

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:25.920
between 0 degrees straight ahead
and 1 degree to the right or 1

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.200
degree to the left.

00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:28.575
It's very impressive
performance.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:35.580
In the middle frequencies,
where the ITDs

00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:41.180
are starting to break
down and become ambiguous,

00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:43.910
our performance is not so good.

00:32:43.910 --> 00:32:46.825
Minimum audible angles go
up to perhaps 3 degrees.

00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.520
And then they get
a little bit better

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.790
at the very high frequencies.

00:32:52.790 --> 00:32:55.880
And remember here, we said
that the interaural level

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:58.225
differences were very salient.

00:32:59.820 --> 00:33:03.470
So at 5 kilohertz, there
was a 20 dB difference.

00:33:03.470 --> 00:33:06.700
And we come back down,
maybe not to 1 degree

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.820
minimum audible
angle, but maybe to 2.

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:10.380
So almost as good.

00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:13.600
And then at very
high frequencies,

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.660
we get worse again.

00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:23.600
Now, we can take
these same subjects

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:27.375
and we can go back
to the physical cues.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:36.210
Let's say at a 1 degree
minimum audible angle

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:40.700
at low frequencies where
ITDs are important cues, what

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.070
is the interaural time
difference that a subject can

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.140
just barely detect?

00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:48.040
Well, if you had a
magnifying glass,

00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:49.460
you could read it
off this curve.

00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:53.395
Because 1 degree is a very
small angle on this scale.

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:59.520
But you can calculate it
from the sphere, right?

00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:01.830
And it turns out
that the prediction

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:07.880
is that for the minimum
audible angle of 1 degree,

00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.217
the interaural time
difference is 10.

00:34:10.217 --> 00:34:11.300
Now, this is microseconds.

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.825
It's calculated to
be 10 microseconds.

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:24.370
Where we perform the best,
where we're using ITDs,

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:26.770
this minimum audible
angle, change

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:29.960
in sound source of
1 degree corresponds

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:34.300
to a change of ITD
of 10 microseconds.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:38.790
That seems like an unbelievably
small instant in time.

00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:44.015
But once again, if you
take the subject and now

00:34:44.015 --> 00:34:46.650
instead of an attenuator
in one channel,

00:34:46.650 --> 00:34:51.560
you have a circuit that delays
one ear relative to the other.

00:34:52.989 --> 00:34:56.100
And you say to the
subject, OK, with no delay,

00:34:56.100 --> 00:34:57.740
what did it sound like?

00:34:57.740 --> 00:34:59.260
Straight ahead.

00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:00.030
OK?

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.447
Then you put your
delay in and you

00:35:01.447 --> 00:35:02.821
say, what does it
sound like now?

00:35:02.821 --> 00:35:04.620
And the subject says,
it just barely sounds

00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.250
like it moved a little
bit off to one side.

00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:12.160
And in fact, 10 microseconds is
the just noticeable difference

00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:24.320
for ITD in headphones,
which is evidence then

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:27.762
that we are using these
ITDs at the low frequencies

00:35:27.762 --> 00:35:28.720
for sound localization.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:36.200
Now, you can, as we said,
play the same trick here.

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:39.850
Minimum audible
angle at 2 degrees.

00:35:39.850 --> 00:35:41.665
Go to the ILD curves.

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:46.100
And I'll try to get your
magnifying glass out here

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.085
at 5 kilohertz.

00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:50.270
Look at where 2 degrees is.

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:54.120
And it turns out that the
interaural level difference

00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.595
there is 1 dB.

00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:00.050
Play it in headphones.

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:01.485
The subject says,
yeah, it sounds

00:36:01.485 --> 00:36:03.110
like it's just a
little bit off center.

00:36:04.425 --> 00:36:09.220
So it all fits with these
presentations in free fields

00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:12.937
and these interaural level
cues measured in free fields

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.270
with what you get in headphones.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:19.965
Now, we have some
demos of these things.

00:36:21.910 --> 00:36:24.190
And I have several
kinds of demos.

00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:26.175
So let's do the
real fun one first.

00:36:27.630 --> 00:36:30.310
The problem with fun demos
is sometimes they don't work.

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.970
So this has worked
in some classes

00:36:33.970 --> 00:36:36.190
and has not worked
in other classes.

00:36:36.190 --> 00:36:37.290
I have a sound source.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.360
It has a lot of
high frequencies.

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.940
You can probably appreciate
that, jangling keys.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:47.850
And I would like to
be able to just say,

00:36:47.850 --> 00:36:51.150
OK, I'm going to just give you
interaural level differences.

00:36:51.150 --> 00:36:53.440
Probably, that's
what you'll get here

00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.270
with high frequency sounds.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.610
But I can't assume
that it's also not

00:36:57.610 --> 00:37:00.200
going to have some ITDs
because in this room

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:02.550
there's going to be
differences in time

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:04.870
from the sound source
to your two ears.

00:37:04.870 --> 00:37:06.650
So I'm really going
to give you both cues,

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:10.440
but let's start with this demo
before we go on to headphones.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.890
I'm going to jangle these keys.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:16.560
And I'm going to
ask you, because you

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.950
are such visual people,
to cover your eyes while I

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:21.830
jangle the keys.

00:37:21.830 --> 00:37:24.170
Don't cover yet, because
what I want you to do

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.460
is to tell me where
the keys are coming

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.280
from with your other hand.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.620
I want you to point where you
think the keys are coming from.

00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:36.710
And at the end, after you
hear the sound, keep pointing,

00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:39.750
and look and see
how good you were.

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:40.802
OK?

00:37:40.802 --> 00:37:43.020
So everybody, cover your eyes.

00:37:45.762 --> 00:37:47.350
[KEYS JANGLING]

00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:47.850
OK?

00:37:49.042 --> 00:37:50.750
Now, uncover your eyes
and keep pointing.

00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:54.810
OK, so we're doing
pretty well here.

00:37:54.810 --> 00:37:59.230
Maybe 20 degree angle, but
most of you guys are on.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:01.257
All of you guys are on.

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.810
All right, let's
do it once more.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:06.485
So blindfold yourself.

00:38:06.485 --> 00:38:08.655
Going to move the
position of the keys.

00:38:08.655 --> 00:38:12.830
[KEYS JANGLING]

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.030
OK, open your eyes
and keep pointing.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.910
OK, you guys are good.

00:38:16.910 --> 00:38:19.150
Maybe like 20 degrees.

00:38:19.150 --> 00:38:21.130
I changed the elevation
a little bit too,

00:38:21.130 --> 00:38:24.030
so you guys are making
mistakes in elevation.

00:38:24.030 --> 00:38:24.890
You guys are good.

00:38:25.961 --> 00:38:26.460
OK.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:30.750
Now, since I claimed to you
that we're using two ears,

00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:35.420
I would like you to plug
one ear, blindfold yourself.

00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.460
Now, it's going to be a little
bit of a trick to point, right?

00:38:38.460 --> 00:38:40.490
So I don't know how
you're going to point.

00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:42.630
You can point with
your elbow or you

00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:44.480
can do whatever
you want to point.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.992
AUDIENCE: Close your eyes.

00:38:45.992 --> 00:38:47.450
PROFESSOR: You can
close your eyes.

00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:48.750
OK, if you're truthful.

00:38:50.900 --> 00:38:52.429
You can close your eyes, OK.

00:38:53.866 --> 00:38:58.840
[KEYS JANGLING]

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.590
OK, open up and we'll
see how you did.

00:39:01.590 --> 00:39:02.465
You guys are good.

00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.360
There's an error.

00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.145
That's the biggest
error I've seen so far.

00:39:08.820 --> 00:39:11.587
This is an error, like
at least 45 degrees.

00:39:11.587 --> 00:39:12.420
This is an era here.

00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:14.470
So we're doing more poorly.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:17.540
Let's plug the other ear
and I'll repeat the sound.

00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:20.750
OK, close your eyes.

00:39:22.714 --> 00:39:29.110
[KEYS JANGLING]

00:39:29.110 --> 00:39:31.300
OK, open your eyes

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:34.178
These are some errors.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:37.387
Oh, this is a big error.

00:39:38.670 --> 00:39:40.250
This is an error.

00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:44.151
OK, so we're clearly,
anecdotally, getting worse.

00:39:44.151 --> 00:39:44.650
OK.

00:39:44.650 --> 00:39:48.070
Now, the ultimate
test, plug one ear.

00:39:48.070 --> 00:39:50.860
And in your remaining
ear, distort your pinna

00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.222
because I claimed that your
pinna cues were helping you.

00:39:54.222 --> 00:39:56.908
And I really don't know how
you're going to point here.

00:40:00.324 --> 00:40:05.180
[KEYS JANGLING]

00:40:05.180 --> 00:40:05.680
OK.

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:06.950
Now, open.

00:40:06.950 --> 00:40:08.710
Just continue to
point if you can.

00:40:09.946 --> 00:40:11.880
OK, so that's a 90 degree error.

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:14.680
You guys are pretty good.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:16.370
You have an error here.

You guys are good.

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.185
This is an error.

00:40:19.730 --> 00:40:20.980
And where were you pointing?

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.880
You were pointing
correctly, yeah.

00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:23.880
So good.

00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.640
OK.

00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:28.100
Let me try it one more time with
distorting pinna and plugging

00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:28.620
one ear.

00:40:31.536 --> 00:40:37.100
[KEYS JANGLING]

00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:39.676
OK, show me where
you were pointing.

You guys are good.

AUDIENCE: Nice.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:43.707
PROFESSOR: This is a
little-- was it harder--

00:40:43.707 --> 00:40:44.790
AUDIENCE: It's impossible.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:45.680
PROFESSOR: It's impossible.

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:46.554
So you were guessing?

00:40:47.778 --> 00:40:49.189
That's why it doesn't work.

00:40:49.189 --> 00:40:50.564
AUDIENCE: It all
sounds the same.

00:40:50.564 --> 00:40:51.330
It all literally
sounds the same.

PROFESSOR: What's that?

00:40:52.326 --> 00:40:53.700
AUDIENCE: It all
sounds the same.

00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:56.158
PROFESSOR: It all sounds the
same with the pinna distorted.

00:40:56.158 --> 00:40:57.010
Right.

00:40:57.010 --> 00:40:59.874
OK, this is a huge error.

00:40:59.874 --> 00:41:00.557
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:00.557 --> 00:41:01.140
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:41:01.140 --> 00:41:02.880
I think it worked.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:07.160
Pinna is very important
in distinguishing front

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:07.875
versus back.

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:12.340
Interaural time and
level differences

00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.440
are equivalent for
front and back.

00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.140
So how do we know
what's front and back?

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:18.290
Well, the pinna cues are
very important for that.

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:22.260
Otherwise, you have
subjects reporting

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:23.980
confusion between
front and back.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:30.540
A lot of the times to eliminate
front-back confusions,

00:41:30.540 --> 00:41:32.332
experimenters will
require subjects

00:41:32.332 --> 00:41:34.040
to point in the frontal
[? hemisphere. ?]

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.140
And say, it's not in the back.

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:38.082
I give you that
it's in the front.

00:41:39.450 --> 00:41:43.270
OK, so we have more
control demonstrations

00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:46.450
that can be presented
during headphones.

00:41:46.450 --> 00:41:48.920
And we have demonstration
of these two cues.

00:41:50.047 --> 00:41:51.505
And there are three
demonstrations.

00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:59.075
So the first two
demonstrations are ITDs.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.695
And the first one uses tones.

00:42:04.750 --> 00:42:06.370
So a tone is a sine wave.

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:15.090
And it's going to give you tones
of 500 Hertz and 2,000 Hertz.

00:42:15.090 --> 00:42:18.390
So the low frequency
and higher frequency

00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:22.230
are heard with alternating
interaural phases

00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:25.555
of plus and minus 45 degrees.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:32.860
So let me just remind you, we
saw here an interaural phase

00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:34.440
difference of about 90 degrees.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.660
So this is going
to be half of that.

00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.080
Interaural phase
differences of 45 degrees

00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:43.290
for these 2 pure tones.

00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:47.930
The second one for ITDs
is going to use clicks.

00:42:49.185 --> 00:42:51.685
And they're going to be repeated
just like my hand clapping.

00:42:52.710 --> 00:42:56.420
Next, the interaural arrival
time of a click is varied.

00:42:56.420 --> 00:43:00.110
And it doesn't tell
you how big the ITD is.

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:03.750
The apparent location of
the click appears to move.

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:06.520
And to me, it sounds like
the clicks are going around.

00:43:07.970 --> 00:43:10.740
Somebody clapping their hands
moving around in a circle.

00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:14.125
Now, when you listen to these
demos with earphones or ear

00:43:14.125 --> 00:43:16.910
buds, sometimes you
get the impression

00:43:16.910 --> 00:43:18.690
that wherever it's
coming from, it's

00:43:18.690 --> 00:43:20.520
sort of like on the
surface of your head.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:22.980
It's not way out there.

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.360
That may be because
you have lost

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:27.740
some of the room acoustics.

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:29.790
Certainly, you're not
listening to reflections.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:33.710
But you've also lost the
effects of the pinna, which

00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:35.500
filter things in
such a way that they

00:43:35.500 --> 00:43:37.960
sound more roomy or out there.

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:39.650
These things sort
of sound internal,

00:43:39.650 --> 00:43:42.460
but they still appear
to change in azimuth.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.790
And I think this click
demonstration is the most vivid

00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:47.700
of the three.

00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:50.355
The final demonstration is
interaural level differences.

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.510
The overall interaural
level difference

00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:58.020
of a 100 and 4,000
tone is varied.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.260
Now, heads up here.

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.070
This low-frequency
tone is never going

00:44:02.070 --> 00:44:06.496
to have an ILD in normal
free-field acoustics.

00:44:06.496 --> 00:44:08.120
It's just never going
to happen because

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:09.300
of the size of your head.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.710
You have to have a huge
head to cause a sound shadow

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:14.490
for that low of a frequency.

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:18.820
But you can certainly just-- as
easily as for high frequencies,

00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:20.800
present that in headphones.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:24.860
And it is perceptually
obvious, OK?

00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:26.220
So there's these three demos.

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.519
So how many people have
them on your machines

00:44:28.519 --> 00:44:29.310
and have earphones?

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:33.715
OK, so you guys can
just go right ahead.

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:36.410
How does it appear?

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:40.795
Are they in order?

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:43.685
Do they have names?

00:44:43.685 --> 00:44:45.350
AUDIENCE: You can just
download them from Stellar.

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:46.016
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:44:46.016 --> 00:44:49.400
You can download them from
Stellar if you haven't already.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.200
They should be on
the course website.

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:52.475
So just do them in sequence.

00:44:54.180 --> 00:44:56.810
People who don't have
them on their laptops

00:44:56.810 --> 00:44:58.400
can listen up here.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.745
I have these listening stations.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.160
So whoever wants to come
up and listen can come up.

00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:16.510
Could you hear them
going around your head?

00:45:16.510 --> 00:45:18.650
That's, to me, the most vivid.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:19.850
Comments about the others?

00:45:22.670 --> 00:45:26.180
This last one is
kind of piercing

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.265
for the high frequency, right?

00:45:28.265 --> 00:45:30.580
And it still sounds
like it's moving around.

00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:33.150
What about for this
lower frequency?

00:45:33.150 --> 00:45:35.910
Did it sound like it
was moving around?

00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:38.630
OK, even though
that stimulus is not

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:39.830
present in free-field sound.

00:45:39.830 --> 00:45:42.720
You will never hear
that without headphones.

00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.690
It's perceptually obviously.

00:45:44.690 --> 00:45:47.250
Now, how about this ITD?

00:45:47.250 --> 00:45:51.810
To me, this 500 Hertz interaural
phase difference is obvious,

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.564
but the 2,000 Hertz wasn't.

00:45:53.564 --> 00:45:54.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.690
PROFESSOR: Clear for you.

00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:58.170
Any speculation on why
that would be true?

00:46:02.204 --> 00:46:03.120
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:12.974 --> 00:46:14.640
PROFESSOR: OK, what
we're saying is then

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:27.570
that this is the left
ear for the low frequency

00:46:27.570 --> 00:46:30.355
and the right ear is, what?

00:46:30.355 --> 00:46:31.390
45 degrees?

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:33.616
So it's going to be
sort of like this.

00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:45.515
OK, that's for maybe
the lower frequency.

00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:52.270
And the higher frequency is
quite a bit higher, right?

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:59.000
It's more than
twice the frequency.

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.850
So it's more than twice as much.

00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:03.600
I'm a terrible
artist, but it's going

00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.765
to go back and forth faster.

00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:15.790
And this is going to
be delayed 45 degrees.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:19.080
So because this is
going faster, it's

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:26.865
a smaller time difference
for the high frequency.

00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.630
So you might say, OK, it's
just a smaller time difference.

00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:34.350
And that's why it's harder
for us to distinguish it.

00:47:34.350 --> 00:47:37.070
But remember the concept
that we had of phase

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:39.420
locking of the auditory nerve.

00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:43.280
In the auditory nerve,
the left auditory nerve

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:45.961
is going to fire some spikes
at some point in the stimulus

00:47:45.961 --> 00:47:46.460
waveform.

00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.280
The right auditory
nerve is going

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:52.430
to fire some spikes at
a corresponding point

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.470
in the stimulus waveform
for the first cycle.

00:47:55.470 --> 00:47:57.810
OK, let's repeat it
for the second cycle.

00:47:57.810 --> 00:47:59.362
Going to fire in
there somewhere.

00:47:59.362 --> 00:48:01.195
This one's going to
fire in there somewhere.

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:04.940
And remember, cycles are
going by pretty quickly.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:06.530
There's lots of time.

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:09.380
So you can build up
a response pattern

00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:12.010
where you have
thousands of spikes

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:14.850
there, thousands of spikes here.

00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:20.450
And these two auditory nerves
are coming into the brain.

00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:23.650
They're synapsing in the left
and right cochlear nucleus.

00:48:23.650 --> 00:48:25.180
Cochlear nuclei.

00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:29.110
The cochlear nuclei are
then projecting centrally.

00:48:29.110 --> 00:48:32.911
And at some places, the left
and the right-side pathways

00:48:32.911 --> 00:48:33.410
converge.

00:48:35.090 --> 00:48:38.540
There's a comparator then that's
comparing the arrival time

00:48:38.540 --> 00:48:41.070
and it's saying the left ear
signal is getting to me first

00:48:41.070 --> 00:48:42.820
and the right ear is
a little bit delayed.

00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.760
What happens with
the higher frequency?

00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.700
So this is an interesting
high frequency.

00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.570
This is the 2,000 Hertz.

00:48:51.570 --> 00:48:53.500
What happens to
the phase locking

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.120
for frequencies
above 1,000 Hertz?

00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:59.330
It declines, right?

00:48:59.330 --> 00:49:02.660
So instead of a nice
synchronized pattern,

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.525
this left auditory nerve
is going to respond.

00:49:05.525 --> 00:49:06.800
The right is going to respond.

00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:12.060
But from successive
cycle to cycle,

00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.660
the pattern is not
going to be synced

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:17.515
to a particular point in
the stimulus waveform.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:24.627
So instead of getting a
nice synchronized pattern,

00:49:24.627 --> 00:49:25.960
it's going to be unsynchronized.

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.530
And maybe for some
stimulus presentations,

00:49:29.530 --> 00:49:31.450
the right-side spike
is going to come

00:49:31.450 --> 00:49:33.480
in earlier than the left side.

00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.260
And the comparator
is going to say, WTF.

00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.965
I don't know where the
sound is coming from, right?

00:49:41.170 --> 00:49:44.560
So the fact that phase
locking breaks down

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.100
means that the timing at
wherever the central comparator

00:49:48.100 --> 00:49:50.662
is, it's not synchronized.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:54.320
Timing here is synchronized.

00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.430
The timing here is
not synchronized.

00:49:56.430 --> 00:50:02.510
And we're claiming with
this psychophysical metrics

00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:06.160
that we can detect a
difference between the left

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.133
and the right ear minimally
at 10 microseconds.

00:50:12.790 --> 00:50:14.980
With synchronized
patterns at least.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.930
Now, let me just draw--
it's not too surprised.

00:50:19.930 --> 00:50:23.490
Everybody understands why when
you break down phase locking,

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:25.855
you don't have a
temporal code anymore?

00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:35.540
Let me show you the spike
waveforms for one spike coming

00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:36.920
in in the left
side and one spike

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.700
coming in the right
side that are delayed

00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:42.930
by this minimal time
of 10 microseconds.

00:50:45.310 --> 00:50:50.890
So here is spike, let's
say the left side.

00:50:54.990 --> 00:50:58.300
So to draw a spike coming in
from the right side delayed

00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:02.330
10 microseconds, I need to
know the time base here.

00:51:02.330 --> 00:51:08.170
How long does it
take a spike to fire

00:51:08.170 --> 00:51:09.500
in the central nervous system?

00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:10.700
What is the duration here?

00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:12.280
What's the time scale here?

00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.570
AUDIENCE: 1 millisecond.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.190
PROFESSOR: 1
millisecond, very good.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:20.840
OK, so now I'm going to draw
a right-side spike coming

00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:22.765
in that's delayed
by 10 microseconds.

00:51:22.765 --> 00:51:24.170
And it's pretty easy to do.

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:26.500
I'm going to do it
in a different color,

00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:29.940
but it overlays
here very clearly.

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.675
I didn't draw anything because
on this time [? base, ?]

00:51:32.675 --> 00:51:35.036
they're almost perceptually
indistinguishable.

00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:49.730
OK, so the right side here
delayed 10 microseconds.

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:53.490
That's the wonderful
property of this system

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:59.100
that we have relatively
large, long inputs coming

00:51:59.100 --> 00:51:59.865
into the CNS.

00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:04.570
And we can, at the
limits of our perception,

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:08.570
distinguish delays of
a very short time scale

00:52:08.570 --> 00:52:10.420
on the order of 10 microseconds.

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:14.460
That's the impressive nature
of this central comparator,

00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:15.530
wherever it is.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:19.880
And we're about to talk
about where it is now.

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:27.280
So let's look at where
it is in the brain.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:34.730
We had our block diagram of
the central auditory pathway

00:52:34.730 --> 00:52:36.010
before.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.165
And here's kind of a
simplified diagram.

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.270
This is the left side
and the right side

00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:44.650
of the brainstem with the
two auditory nerves coming

00:52:44.650 --> 00:52:46.410
into the two cochlear nuclei.

00:52:47.570 --> 00:52:49.510
And in the cochlear
nuclei, we discussed

00:52:49.510 --> 00:52:52.060
that the auditory nerve
synapses and cochlear

00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:55.530
nucleus neurons then
pick up the message.

00:52:55.530 --> 00:52:58.060
Now, in one sense the
cochlear nucleus neurons

00:52:58.060 --> 00:53:02.645
know only about what's going
on on that side of the brain,

00:53:02.645 --> 00:53:04.820
or that auditory nerve.

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.500
They're not getting inputs
from the other side.

00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:10.580
So they're not
binaural, if you will.

00:53:10.580 --> 00:53:15.040
The first places where
you have binaural input

00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:17.190
in the auditory
pathway are centers

00:53:17.190 --> 00:53:20.380
like the superior
olivary complex.

00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:32.110
And we talked about that before,
Superior Olivary Complex,

00:53:32.110 --> 00:53:37.180
or SOC, having a bunch of
not only binaural inputs

00:53:37.180 --> 00:53:39.700
but a bunch of
different sub-nuclei.

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:41.790
That's why it's
called a complex.

00:53:41.790 --> 00:53:44.110
One of the most important
of those sub-nuclei

00:53:44.110 --> 00:53:48.120
is the Medial Superior
Olive indicated here by MSO.

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:53.680
And the MSO gets input from
the left cochlear nucleus

00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:55.080
if it's the left MSO.

00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.135
And it also gets input from
the right cochlear nucleus.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:04.130
And here is a very
good guess, at least,

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:07.680
for where the
central comparator is

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:10.260
on the basis of interaural
time differences.

00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:15.360
And this was appreciated
from very early time point.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:18.870
If you draw MSO neurons here,
they have two dendrites.

00:54:20.270 --> 00:54:22.770
One's going to the left side,
one's going to the right side.

00:54:22.770 --> 00:54:26.760
And they get numerous synaptic
inputs onto each dendrite.

00:54:27.810 --> 00:54:31.900
If you make a lesion, so you
interrupt the inputs coming

00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:35.960
from, for example, the
right side, all the inputs

00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.440
onto the right
dendrites drop off.

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:40.000
So it looks like
all these inputs

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:41.370
are coming from the right side.

00:54:42.660 --> 00:54:45.470
They've dropped off when
their pathway has been cut.

00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:48.335
And the left ones remain
because their pathway is intact.

00:54:49.750 --> 00:54:53.550
So clearly, the MSO neurons
get input from the two sides.

00:54:54.702 --> 00:55:00.840
Now, way back in the
1940s, a psychologist

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:05.090
whose name was Lloyd
Jeffress proposed the model

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:07.020
for detection of the ITDs.

00:55:08.510 --> 00:55:13.490
And he guessed at several
locations in the brain

00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:16.330
where this model could
actually be present.

00:55:16.330 --> 00:55:19.250
And one of his guesses
was in the MSO.

00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:23.030
And it turns out the MSO was the
correct of his several guesses.

00:55:24.510 --> 00:55:28.490
And this is a very
interesting model

00:55:28.490 --> 00:55:30.930
for neural processing of ITDs.

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:35.080
And it has several
important assumptions.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:41.310
First, the MSO receives
input from the left

00:55:41.310 --> 00:55:43.450
and the right side, as
we have just gone over.

00:55:45.510 --> 00:55:48.480
So these are axons coming
in from the left side.

00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.900
And these are axons coming
in from the right side.

00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:54.270
And the dots there are the
MSO neurons themselves.

00:55:56.850 --> 00:56:01.350
The dots are very
fussy kind of neurons.

00:56:01.350 --> 00:56:03.335
They don't just
respond to any input.

00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.150
They're very discerning.

00:56:06.150 --> 00:56:08.920
They say, OK, I got some
input from the left side.

00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:11.640
Not a big deal.

00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:14.960
We get some input
from the right side,

00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.020
I'm not going to get
excited about that.

00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:20.330
But I'm going to get very
excited if I get input

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:24.625
from the left and the right
side at the same time.

00:56:26.107 --> 00:56:27.106
That is, coincidentally.

00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.870
And so the MSO
neurons are sometimes

00:56:31.870 --> 00:56:34.420
called coincidence detectors.

00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.570
That is, they detect
and they respond only

00:56:37.570 --> 00:56:41.080
when they get coincident
input from the left

00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:41.880
and the right side.

00:56:43.011 --> 00:56:44.450
Well, how's that
going to help us

00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:48.560
if we're delaying one
side versus the other?

00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:52.140
Well, the second major
component of the Jeffress model

00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:55.730
is that the axons providing
input, which we now know

00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:58.550
are coming from the
cochlear nucleus,

00:56:58.550 --> 00:57:01.730
they run down the
length of the MSO.

00:57:01.730 --> 00:57:04.585
And as they run down the
length, they give off branches

00:57:04.585 --> 00:57:09.260
to each MSO neuron in this long
chain going from left to right.

00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:14.250
And if you know anything about
spikes that are traveling down

00:57:14.250 --> 00:57:18.260
axons or nerve
fibers, you'll know

00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.550
that the spikes
don't get instantly

00:57:20.550 --> 00:57:23.400
to the very tip of the axon.

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.840
But it takes them time
to travel down the axon.

00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.100
And so for example in this axon,
the impulse is coming down here

00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.790
and it gets to this
leftmost branch first.

00:57:35.130 --> 00:57:36.980
And then a little
bit later in time,

00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.230
it gets to the next branch.

00:57:39.330 --> 00:57:41.290
And so on and so
forth until it gets

00:57:41.290 --> 00:57:44.870
to the rightmost branch
at the longest delay.

00:57:46.560 --> 00:57:50.570
So Jeffress said, the inputs
to the MSO are, if you will,

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:51.636
delay lines.

00:57:53.310 --> 00:57:58.340
That is, axonal impulse
propagation takes time.

00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:01.400
You can set these lines up
so that they are delay lines.

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:05.825
The inputs on the right
have corresponding delays.

00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:10.676
Now, how big are the delays?

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:15.210
And the flip side
of that question

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:21.894
is, how long does it take
impulses to travel down axons?

00:58:24.535 --> 00:58:36.930
So another name for that is the
conduction velocity in axons.

00:58:36.930 --> 00:58:39.130
Well, these are,
let's say, myelinated

00:58:39.130 --> 00:58:43.430
axons of pretty big
size, like 5 micrometers.

00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:51.110
So let's say they're
myelinated, a large diameter.

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:57.910
5 micrometers, let's say.

00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:02.560
It turns out that such
a conduction velocity

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:05.700
for those kinds of axons is
about 10 meters per second.

00:59:08.850 --> 00:59:11.430
And Jeffress was
sharp enough to know

00:59:11.430 --> 00:59:15.430
that in the dimensions
of the brain,

00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:17.640
those conduction
velocities work out

00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:20.460
to predict about the
right delay for the kinds

00:59:20.460 --> 00:59:22.660
of interaural time
differences that we're

00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:26.920
talking about for sounds
that differ in azimuth.

00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:32.350
So Jeffress, at the time he
was postulating his model

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:35.150
in the 1940s, there
were good measurements

00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:36.935
of axonal conduction velocity.

00:59:37.990 --> 00:59:40.700
And he realized that
these delay lines

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:45.210
were pretty good for
predicting or compensating

00:59:45.210 --> 00:59:46.715
for the interaural
time differences.

00:59:47.950 --> 00:59:49.300
Now, how does this model work?

00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:53.340
Well, I have a little demo of
the model, which is a movie.

00:59:56.025 --> 00:59:58.490
Which I have in a
different PowerPoint.

00:59:58.490 --> 01:00:03.815
And I'm going to show
this coincidence model.

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:12.450
And I guess I didn't
credit the person who

01:00:12.450 --> 01:00:15.749
made this movie,
which is Tom Yin.

01:00:20.137 --> 01:00:21.720
And he works on the
auditory brainstem

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:24.094
and he's based at the University
of Wisconsin in Madison.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:28.400
So what this demo will
show you is you'll

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.280
be looking down
onto the brainstem.

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:35.550
And the MSO on the left side and
the right side will be present.

01:00:35.550 --> 01:00:39.710
The model is set up to demo
the MSO on the right side.

01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:42.440
There will be a
cochlea on the left

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:44.620
and a cochlea on the right.

01:00:44.620 --> 01:00:46.950
The auditory nerve coming
into the cochlear nucleus

01:00:46.950 --> 01:00:48.890
on the left and
the auditory nerve

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:51.260
coming into the cochlear
nucleus on the right.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:55.100
And those two nuclei will be
providing inputs to the MSO.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.030
And action potentials,
or impulses, along

01:00:58.030 --> 01:01:01.170
these nerve fibers
will be indicated

01:01:01.170 --> 01:01:03.530
by little highlights--
little yellow lights.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.410
And the demonstration
will show you

01:01:08.410 --> 01:01:11.980
what happens to these
incoming impulses that

01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:16.879
converge at the MSO for a
sound that's straight ahead.

01:01:16.879 --> 01:01:18.420
So a sound that's
straight ahead will

01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:21.040
strike the two
sides at the same--

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.220
will strike the two
pathways at the same.

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.055
And you'll see what
happens to the MSO

01:01:26.055 --> 01:01:29.090
and which neuron in the
coincidence detector

01:01:29.090 --> 01:01:31.050
array lights up.

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:33.775
Then, I think it'll play that
same demo in slow motion.

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.110
Then, the second part
of the demo I think

01:01:38.110 --> 01:01:42.440
has the sound source displaced
off to the left side.

01:01:42.440 --> 01:01:46.160
So the sound wave front will
come and strike the left side

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:49.520
first and the right
side after a delay--

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.550
the interaural time difference.

01:01:51.550 --> 01:01:55.260
And you'll see what happens
to the impulses and the MSO

01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:59.645
neurons with that second
sound source position.

01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:06.670
So here are the two
cochleas, left and right.

01:02:06.670 --> 01:02:07.580
Here is the MSO.

01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:14.305
This is the right
cochlear nucleus.

01:02:14.305 --> 01:02:16.070
This is the left
cochlear nucleus.

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.270
This is the MSO we're
not talking about.

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:21.120
This is the right MSO.

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.240
There was a sound wavefront
that hit the two sides equally.

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.250
And it was a little
hard to appreciate,

01:02:26.250 --> 01:02:32.140
but I think this neuron up here
in this part of the MSO lit up.

01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:34.140
This is going to be
the same wavefront

01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:38.640
in slow motion activating the
two cochleas at the same time,

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:41.910
the two cochlear nuclei
at the same time,

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:44.576
and coming in to the MSO.

01:02:44.576 --> 01:02:46.950
This one gets there first
because it's on the right side.

01:02:48.550 --> 01:02:51.600
And the two impulses
arrive coincidentally

01:02:51.600 --> 01:02:53.380
at MSO neuron number 2.

01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:58.060
And that's the one, because it
gets coincident input-- that's

01:02:58.060 --> 01:02:59.430
the one that fires off.

01:03:01.090 --> 01:03:03.750
Here's a second part of the
demo where the sound is now

01:03:03.750 --> 01:03:06.080
located off to the left side.

01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:09.740
First, it's going to
show you in fast motion

01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:11.010
and then in slow motion.

01:03:14.410 --> 01:03:17.190
Left cochlea activates
first, right second.

01:03:18.510 --> 01:03:21.570
And now, the MSO neuron
that got coincident input

01:03:21.570 --> 01:03:25.616
is located down here,
neuron number 6 I believe.

01:03:25.616 --> 01:03:27.930
Now, it's going to
show you that offset

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:29.360
sound source in slow motion.

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:34.420
Left cochlea gets activated
first, right second.

01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:38.880
Left cochlear nucleus first,
right cochlear nucleus second.

01:03:40.390 --> 01:03:44.120
Now, the delay
lines are set up so

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.440
that neuron number
six in the MSO

01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:50.600
is the one that
responds because it now

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:52.190
is the one that gets
coincident input.

01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:55.190
Is that clear?

01:03:56.590 --> 01:04:00.880
So what you've set
up then in the MSO

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:08.460
is an array of neurons where
0 ITD is mapped up here

01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:13.280
and left leading ITDs
are mapped down here.

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:16.930
You've mapped interaural
time difference

01:04:16.930 --> 01:04:19.880
to position along
the MSO in the brain.

01:04:21.922 --> 01:04:23.172
And that's the Jeffress model.

01:04:32.028 --> 01:04:41.610
So the Jeffress model has
been tested experimentally

01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:45.630
by going in and recording
from single MSO neurons.

01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:53.010
So easy to say and extremely
difficult to do in practice.

01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.580
It's not absolutely clear why.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.640
It may be that the
MSO neurons are small

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:04.620
and there are thousands of
big inputs coming to them,

01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:07.350
so that you get what
are called big field

01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:11.075
potentials in your recordings
and very small spikes.

01:05:12.590 --> 01:05:17.400
So the number of studies
of actual MSO recordings

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.840
can probably be listed on
the fingers of one hand.

01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:22.700
So we don't have very much data.

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:27.950
What data we have
from MSO neurons

01:05:27.950 --> 01:05:32.050
shows clearly that
the firing rate

01:05:32.050 --> 01:05:34.940
is dependent on the
interaural time difference.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:37.580
And that's what this
graph shows here.

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:41.990
I'm sorry it's not very
clear, but 0 interaural time

01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:44.980
difference is right here
with the dashed line.

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:49.010
The firing rate is
plotted on the y-axis.

01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:54.960
These dots over here
indicate the firing rate

01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:57.020
for just left ear sound.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.890
Or in the other one,
just right ear sound.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:04.620
So there's not a very big
firing for presentation

01:06:04.620 --> 01:06:06.810
of sound in just one
ear or the other.

01:06:06.810 --> 01:06:09.710
That's consistent with
the Jeffress model.

01:06:09.710 --> 01:06:12.150
Also, consistent
with the Jeffress

01:06:12.150 --> 01:06:17.810
model is that if you
get a particular ITD

01:06:17.810 --> 01:06:20.550
from the particular neuron
that you're recording from,

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.375
that neuron fires a great deal.

01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:29.650
And other ITDs elicit
much less firing.

01:06:29.650 --> 01:06:33.400
That is, the delay lines
didn't allow coincident input

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:36.930
to come and excite that neuron.

01:06:36.930 --> 01:06:40.780
So firing rate that changes a
great deal as a function of ITD

01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:42.450
is consistent with
the Jeffress model.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:48.120
There, probably because
there's so few data,

01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:52.300
the idea of this
mapping along the MSO

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:55.810
is not borne out by the
scanty experimental distance.

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:57.450
So we don't really
know that there's

01:06:57.450 --> 01:07:01.680
a map as a function of a
particular brain distance.

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.700
This is the
anterior-posterior distance.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.530
And they put this line here.

01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:10.110
Really, the data are
all over the map.

01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:13.160
So it's not clear that
there's an organized mapping.

01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:17.500
It is clear that there's
a function of firing

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:18.760
when you change the ITD.

01:07:23.535 --> 01:07:27.565
So there are some updates
to the Jeffress model.

01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:31.960
And I'm not going to go
through these in detail,

01:07:31.960 --> 01:07:34.523
but I want to point
them out to you

01:07:34.523 --> 01:07:36.773
because this is part of the
answer to your assignment.

01:07:37.950 --> 01:07:42.870
The assignment says, sort of
here's the Jeffress model.

01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:45.080
Give me a quick outline of it.

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.360
So that's just what I said.

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.540
I've given you that part.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:52.680
The second part says,
well, the Jeffress model

01:07:52.680 --> 01:07:55.040
is maybe currently
under discussion.

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:00.470
What are new
experimental evidence--

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:03.860
new I mean from the
last 15 years-- that's

01:08:03.860 --> 01:08:06.810
not perfectly consistent
with the Jeffress model?

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.070
And you should go
to this paper, which

01:08:10.070 --> 01:08:14.850
is the assigned paper for
today's lecture, in which they

01:08:14.850 --> 01:08:18.689
discuss point number
1, point number 2,

01:08:18.689 --> 01:08:19.880
and several other points.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:25.319
At least one other point is
demonstrated in that paper

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:28.620
to show some
experimental evidence

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:31.859
from MSO recordings
which is not perfectly

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:33.510
consistent with
the Jeffress model.

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:35.010
Or makes you think,
well, maybe they

01:08:35.010 --> 01:08:41.230
Jeffress model is not
complete, or is outright wrong.

01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:46.840
And these are recordings
from Brandt et al.

01:08:48.399 --> 01:08:51.939
The earlier slide I showed you
was from recordings in Cat.

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:54.645
Cat has become less and
less the experimental model.

01:08:55.750 --> 01:08:58.920
And these are now recordings
from smaller animals which

01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.332
are more in vogue to
use experimentally.

01:09:01.332 --> 01:09:02.790
In this case, it's
from the gerbil,

01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.145
which is a popular animal.

01:09:04.145 --> 01:09:08.680
It has a big MSO, good
low-frequency hearing

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.359
where you use
prominent ITD cues.

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:16.939
And this paper
clearly is a challenge

01:09:16.939 --> 01:09:18.319
to the Jeffress model.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:21.279
I don't think it
completely rules it out,

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:25.300
but clearly there are
some data from this paper

01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:27.670
to suggest that it
might not be everything.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:31.210
Now, the second part
of the assignment.

01:09:33.206 --> 01:09:34.580
Actually, that's
the second part.

01:09:34.580 --> 01:09:38.880
The third part of
the assignment comes

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.770
from some other
experimental data

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:44.100
that I'm not going to
give you because you

01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:45.500
don't need to know about them.

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:51.220
But some labeling studies have
asked the question, OK, I'm

01:09:51.220 --> 01:09:54.360
going to inject a neural
tracer into my cochlear nucleus

01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:55.460
neuron.

01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.540
I'm going to trace
its axon and I'm

01:09:57.540 --> 01:10:00.360
going to find this
nice, ladder-like delay

01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:01.330
line in the MSO.

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.570
Those labeling studies
haven't been particularly

01:10:05.570 --> 01:10:09.940
gratifying in that they
don't fit this model so well.

01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:14.500
I say here, at
first it was thought

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:17.680
that there were delay
lines from both sides.

01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:20.300
Labeling studies suggest
that there is only

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:23.730
a delay line for
contralateral input.

01:10:23.730 --> 01:10:26.410
OK, so that's not exactly
consistent with the Jeffress

01:10:26.410 --> 01:10:26.910
model.

01:10:27.930 --> 01:10:30.360
And even more recent
studies since I

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:33.800
wrote this suggests maybe there
aren't even delay lines at all.

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:36.010
So experimentally,
someone doesn't

01:10:36.010 --> 01:10:38.435
see a delay line, that
doesn't mean it's not there.

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:40.390
It just means maybe
it's not so obvious.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:44.180
But people have started
thinking about maybe

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:49.820
there are other ways to
provide delays in inputs

01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:53.630
to the MSO that might make
the Jeffress model work.

01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:57.270
If you have coincident
detectors and they

01:10:57.270 --> 01:11:03.270
respond only when the delay a
certain ITD-- matches the ITD.

01:11:03.270 --> 01:11:05.710
So the third part
of the assignment

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:11.260
asks you for other ways
that you can think of

01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:31.230
to create delays to MSO neurons.

01:11:36.340 --> 01:11:39.890
And let me give you a
couple hints to the answers

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:40.780
that I'm looking for.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:49.320
I think you should think about
the synapse between the input

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:51.530
from the cochlear nucleus
to the MSO neuron.

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:56.550
How could you create
different types

01:11:56.550 --> 01:12:00.305
of delays using
synaptic properties?

01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:15.090
So this is kind of
a thought question

01:12:15.090 --> 01:12:17.950
because these haven't
been measured yet.

01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:21.800
Secondly, there is another
way to create delays.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:24.510
And it comes from
properties of the cochlea.

01:12:27.550 --> 01:12:30.390
And that brings us to
our reading for today.

01:12:30.390 --> 01:12:31.490
We always have a reading.

01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:36.865
The reading is from this
obscure document, also called

01:12:36.865 --> 01:12:38.500
our textbook.

01:12:38.500 --> 01:12:43.610
OK, and the reading
is on page 61.

01:12:51.130 --> 01:12:53.030
Page 61 is the early
part of the book.

01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:56.400
It's talking about
the ear, the cochlea.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:13:00.060
It says, "But you may also note
that the vibration of parts

01:13:00.060 --> 01:13:03.000
of the basilar membrane
tuned to frequencies below 1

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.450
kilohertz-- very low-- appear
time shifted or delayed

01:13:08.450 --> 01:13:11.355
relative to those tuned
above 1 kilohertz.

01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:15.070
This comes about because
of the mechanical filters

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:17.270
that make up the
basilar membrane.

01:13:17.270 --> 01:13:19.950
They're not all in
phase with each other.

01:13:19.950 --> 01:13:22.670
If you look at Figure 2.4--"

01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:26.140
So everybody should look
at Figure 2.4 in the text.

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:28.230
So this is my devious
way of getting

01:13:28.230 --> 01:13:30.670
you to actually
open the textbook.

01:13:30.670 --> 01:13:33.010
You will see that the impulse
responses of the lower

01:13:33.010 --> 01:13:35.890
frequency filters rise
to the first peak later

01:13:35.890 --> 01:13:37.710
than those of the
higher frequency ones.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:42.390
OK, so don't just quote the
textbook in your answer.

01:13:42.390 --> 01:13:48.360
Tell me how you could get
a delay that would make up

01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:52.580
for the interaural time
difference using this cochlear

01:13:52.580 --> 01:13:56.100
property that's mentioned
in the textbook page 61.

01:13:56.100 --> 01:14:00.165
And it's illustrated in
Figure 2.4 of the textbook.

01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:05.470
That's another way people
are thinking of an alternate

01:14:05.470 --> 01:14:07.350
to Jeffress delay lines.

01:14:08.650 --> 01:14:11.886
And then finally,
because last time I

01:14:11.886 --> 01:14:13.510
thought that it was
too easy-- you guys

01:14:13.510 --> 01:14:16.305
are too smart-- I added
something to the assignment.

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:22.820
This fits with my son's view--
my son is in high school

01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:26.111
and he says, teachers
love to load on homework.

01:14:26.111 --> 01:14:26.985
The more, the better.

01:14:28.350 --> 01:14:31.365
So I added something to
make this assignment more

01:14:31.365 --> 01:14:31.865
challenging.

01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.840
And here's what I added.

01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.215
And so I think this has now
been posted on the website.

01:14:38.740 --> 01:14:41.400
It doesn't add a great
deal of difficulty,

01:14:41.400 --> 01:14:45.790
but I think it makes it
more relevant to our course.

01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:49.670
I haven't updated this.

01:14:49.670 --> 01:14:52.920
OK, well, look on the
website, course website.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.870
I haven't updated
on my computer yet.

01:14:54.870 --> 01:14:56.550
Look on the course website.

01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:59.700
The very last part of
the assignment, there's

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:08.410
one sentence that says, how
would a cochlear implant user

01:15:08.410 --> 01:15:12.785
have trouble using the Jeffress
model to localize sounds?

01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:17.360
Even if the cochlear
implant user

01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:20.635
had a cochlear implant in the
left ear and a cochlear implant

01:15:20.635 --> 01:15:22.040
in the right ear?

01:15:22.040 --> 01:15:23.600
And I think this
is a fair question.

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.940
We spent a lot of
time on our course

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:27.445
talking about cochlear implants.

01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:34.680
And cochlear implant processing
is clearly very different

01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:37.230
than we, as normal hearers,
have the processing

01:15:37.230 --> 01:15:38.590
on our auditory nerve.

01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:40.420
So think about that.

01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:43.650
How would the
Jeffress model not be

01:15:43.650 --> 01:15:47.070
able to be used very well by
a cochlear implant user who

01:15:47.070 --> 01:15:49.340
had implants in the
left and right side?

01:15:52.930 --> 01:15:54.440
So this is a written assignment.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.350
I think before we talked
about how long it should be.

01:15:57.350 --> 01:16:02.135
And I can't remember how--
maybe five pages is plenty.

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.925
In the very beginning, it
talks about the Jeffress model.

01:16:08.925 --> 01:16:10.285
So give me a quick sketch.

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:18.255
It's due on December 4, which
is the day of the lab tour.

01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:22.630
And you could send
them to me by email

01:16:22.630 --> 01:16:25.970
or you can bring a printed
copy to the lab your.

01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:28.660
Or, you can bring a
printed copy to my office,

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:32.920
but that's at Mass Eye and
Ear where the lab tour is.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:35.690
And the idea behind
having it due then is

01:16:35.690 --> 01:16:37.850
I can look them
over and grade them,

01:16:37.850 --> 01:16:41.000
and then we can talk
about what I thought

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:45.280
is the correct answer to this
at the review session, which

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.960
is the class after December 4.

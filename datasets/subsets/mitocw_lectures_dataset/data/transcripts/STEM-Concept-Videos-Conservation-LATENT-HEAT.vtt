00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.709
If you put water in the freezer, you'll end
up with ice. If you leave ice on your countertop,

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.119
you'll end up with liquid water. You've almost
certainly seen these phase changes in your

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:18.230
everyday experience. But there's more to freezing
and melting than meets the eye, and we can

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.410
use these seemingly simple phenomena to make
buildings significantly more energy efficient.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.480
In this video, we'll explain the concept of
"latent heat" and see how it can dramatically

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.980
reduce heating and cooling costs in homes
and skyscrapers alike.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.980
This video is part of the Conservation video
series.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.329
In order to analyze or modify a system, it
is important to understand how the laws of

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.420
conservation place constraints on that system.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.440
Hi. My name is Stephen Ray and I am a graduate
student in the Department of Mechanical Engineering

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.969
at MIT. My research in the Building Technology
Lab under the guidance of Professor Leon Glicksman

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.079
focuses on energy efficient buildings.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.789
In order to understand the topic of this video,
you should be familiar with the Law of Conservation

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.719
of Energy. You should also be familiar with
the effects of intermolecular forces on phase

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:08.710
transitions.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.750
After watching this video, you should be able
to describe the energy transformations that

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:20.750
occur during a phase change and apply the
law of conservation of energy to phase changes.

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.549
Let's start with a demonstration.

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.158
Here we have a container of water to which
we are adding table salt.

00:01:28.158 --> 00:01:31.439
Quite a bit of table salt, actually.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.090
Let's stir that up.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.000
Next, we are going to crush up some ice to
add to the salt water.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.219
Our goal is to lower the temperature of the
ice bath.

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:44.210
Let's add some more salt.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.579
Freezing point depression, yeah!

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.649
Alright, minus 8 degrees Celcius. That's pretty
good.

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.950
Let's place a smaller container of liquid
water into this ice bath. We've added green

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.340
food coloring to the water so that it is easier
for you to see.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.909
After a few minutes, we'll insert a thermometer
and watch the temperature drop as the water

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.410
is cooled by the ice bath.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.910
The temperature reads about -5 degrees Celsius.
The green water is still a liquid even though

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.910
the temperature is below the normal freezing
point of water. This is called supercooling.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.050
In the next step of this demo, we are going
to add a couple of small pieces of ice to

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.579
the green water. The supercooled water will
crystallize rapidly with the addition of the

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.240
ice.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.200
When this happens, what do you predict will
happen to the temperature on the thermometer?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.990
Will it increase, decrease, or stay the same?

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.920
What reasoning supports your prediction? Pause
the video here to discuss your ideas with

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.920
the person beside you, then continue playing
the video to see what happens.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:59.160
Okay, ready to see what happens? Be sure to
keep your eye on the digital display.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.840
Now we'll drop a couple of small pieces of
ice into the container of green water.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.390
Watch what's happening.

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.700
The green water froze. There is still a little
bit of liquid, but we can turn the container

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.900
upside down and you can see that the ice remains
inside.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.260
So, when the liquid froze, what happened to
the temperature?

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.920
The temperature went up! Is this what you
predicted? How can we explain what happened?

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.010
Well, let's think about what happens at a
molecular level when water changes phase from

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:41.010
a liquid to a solid. In the liquid state,
water molecules are moving around a lot. As

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.210
it gets colder, the water molecules slow down.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.090
Generally speaking, as the water cools and
solidifies, there is an increase in hydrogen

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.290
bonding, the dominant intermolecular force
amongst the water molecules.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.680
With this hint, can you now explain why we
observed a temperature increase when the water

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:05.730
froze? Pause the video, take a moment to think
about it on your own and then discuss your

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:12.730
idea with a classmate. Then, continue playing
the video for an explanation.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:21.040
As we said before, when water transitions
from liquid to solid, there is an increase

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.500
in the number of hydrogen bonds that are formed
between water molecules. Does bond formation

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.740
release energy or require energy?

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.880
Bond formation releases energy.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:39.820
So then, is the process of ice forming exothermic
or endothermic?

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.790
Ice formation is exothermic.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.810
If we were to do an energy balance on the
system and the surroundings, we would see

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:51.820
that the energy that was released by the water
freezing is equivalent to the thermal energy

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:57.930
that caused the temperature to increase. This
is the Law of Conservation of Energy.

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.540
Generally speaking, when a substance transitions
between phases, intermolecular forces between

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.530
neighboring molecules are either formed or
broken. When a substance transitions from

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:14.560
a liquid to a solid, intermolecular forces,
or bonds, are formed and energy is released

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.060
to the surroundings. This is called the latent
heat of fusion.

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:25.260
Going in the other direction, when a substance
transitions from a solid to a liquid, energy

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.340
is required to overcome intermolecular forces,
so this is an endothermic process. Energy

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:37.710
is absorbed from the surroundings. This is
called the latent heat of melting.

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:42.270
The latent heat of melting is equivalent in
magnitude to the latent heat of fusion, but

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.659
opposite in sign.

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:51.659
This phenomenon of latent heat is used in
a variety of ways to heat and cool buildings.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.940
Using melting ice to absorb thermal energy
from the surroundings saves some buildings

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:00.710
thousands of dollars a year in cooling costs.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.389
Consider a large office building during the
middle of a hot summer day. In order to keep

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:10.169
the building comfortable, the air conditioning
is running at full power, requiring a lot

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:15.340
of electricity from the utility company. The
utility companies can't easily shut down their

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.510
power plants, so nearly the same amount of
electricity is produced during the night as

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:27.510
is during the day. However, nighttime demand
for electricity is very low, so utility companies

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.620
sell this electricity at a lower price. This
is common practice by utility companies across

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.370
the U.S.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.010
Engineers have thought of a way to buy the
electricity during the night when it is very

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:46.000
cheap, but use it during the day when they
need to run the air conditioning. This strategy

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.580
is called peak load shifting. Think about
what you have learned so far. There are a

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:58.580
variety of ways this can be done. How do you
think they do this? Pause the video here,

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.120
take a moment to think about it, and discuss
your idea with the person next to you. Continue

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:11.120
playing the video to hear about one way they
do this.

00:07:13.389 --> 00:07:17.990
One way we can decrease the amount of electricity
needed in the daytime to cool a building is

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:23.650
to use the energy storage capacity of ice,
or its latent heat of melting.

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:28.310
Large tanks, such as these in the basement
of the Bank of America Tower in New York,

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:33.630
store water that is frozen over night using
cheap electricity. During the day, the ice

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.370
melts and absorbs energy from the cooling
fluid running through the building's air conditioning

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:44.740
system. Each of the tanks in the Bank of America
building holds approximately 1600 gallons

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:51.720
of water which translates to roughly 570 kilowatt
hours of cooling capacity. Bank of America

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:57.919
reports that these ice tanks supply 25% of
their cooling energy annually.

00:07:57.919 --> 00:08:02.169
The desire to harness latent heat has led
to the development of a class of materials

00:08:02.169 --> 00:08:07.740
called phase change materials. These materials
have been specifically designed to change

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:12.699
phase at desirable temperatures so that they
can store and release energy in a way that

00:08:12.699 --> 00:08:19.580
is useful to consumers. This slide shows some
examples of these materials. The materials

00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:26.580
on this slide fall into three classes of phase
change materials: inorganic salt hydrates,

00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:31.560
paraffinic hydrocarbons, and organic fatty
acids.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:37.169
Some ordinary building materials such as concrete,
dry wall, or insulation have been specially

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:44.149
engineered over the past 50 years to contain
microscopic pellets of phase change materials.

00:08:44.149 --> 00:08:50.600
Cellulose insulation, shown here, is commonly
used to insulate attics and walls. Researchers

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.410
at the Oak Ridge National Laboratories in
the United States have impregnated small paraffin

00:08:55.410 --> 00:09:00.879
pellets in this common type of insulation
to increase its performance.

00:09:00.879 --> 00:09:05.730
Because these pellets are microscopic, the
phase change insulation looks exactly like

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:12.339
the ordinary insulation to our naked eye.
However, under a Scanning Electron Microscopic,

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:16.720
the clusters of paraffinic pellets are easy
to spot.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.899
Now lets look at the measured performance
of a similar type of phase change insulation

00:09:20.899 --> 00:09:26.220
that is installed in a typical residential
roof. The chart here shows the heat transfer

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:32.959
into a house on the vertical axis and time
on the horizontal axis. The two large black

00:09:32.959 --> 00:09:38.170
peaks, which occur during two consecutive
summer days, correspond to the large amount

00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:44.029
of heat transfer into a home that a conventional
roof allows. The smaller green peaks show

00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:48.819
how changing the roof surface material and
venting the attic significantly help lower

00:09:48.819 --> 00:09:55.329
the heat transfer into a home by approximately
70%. This reduction in heat transfer leads

00:09:55.329 --> 00:10:00.999
to less energy required for cooling the home.
The purple curve shows that if phase change

00:10:00.999 --> 00:10:06.459
insulation is used in addition to these roof
modifications, we can reduce the required

00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:10.559
cooling energy by 90%!

00:10:10.559 --> 00:10:16.509
How does phase change insulation help save
energy? Pause the video, take a moment to

00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:23.509
think about it, and share your thoughts with
a classmate.

00:10:26.079 --> 00:10:32.709
Consider two homes with and without PCM roof
insulation. Both homes are exposed to the

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:37.790
same amount of solar energy from the sun.
Although not all of that energy enters the

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:43.230
home without PCM insulation, a significant
portion is transferred through the roof into

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:49.529
the house. The house with PCM insulation reduces
this amount because some of the energy that

00:10:49.529 --> 00:10:55.360
would otherwise enter the house is used to
melt the phase change material in the roof.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.720
In order for this effect to occur each day,
the phase change material must solidify every

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:04.649
night before it can melt again the next day.

00:11:04.649 --> 00:11:10.439
Let's take a look at this chart of example
phase change materials again. What phase change

00:11:10.439 --> 00:11:16.459
material would you use in a home or building
in Singapore? Why? What additional information

00:11:16.459 --> 00:11:22.149
might you need to know to help make your decision?
Pause the video here and discuss your choice

00:11:22.149 --> 00:11:29.149
with the person beside you.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:38.160
On average, year-round temperatures in Singapore
hover between 23 and 32 degrees Celcius. This

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:43.490
is important when making our decision. Some
of you may have selected the calcium chloride

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:48.179
hydrate as a candidate phase change material
because its melting temperature falls within

00:11:48.179 --> 00:11:53.920
the range of daytime high temperatures in
Singapore. You may have selected octadecane

00:11:53.920 --> 00:12:00.869
for a similar reason. If you eliminated paraffin
wax and palmitic acid, it was probably because

00:12:00.869 --> 00:12:05.189
their melting points are so much higher than
the highest outdoor temperatures reached in

00:12:05.189 --> 00:12:11.209
the day. However, these phase change materials
could be used on a conventional dark-colored

00:12:11.209 --> 00:12:18.209
roof where temperatures can exceed 70 C because
of all the energy absorbed from the sun. Caprylic

00:12:18.369 --> 00:12:24.019
acid, on the other hand, has such a low melting
temperature, that few, if any, building components

00:12:24.019 --> 00:12:27.019
would ever drop below this temperature.

00:12:27.019 --> 00:12:33.800
So, let's go back to calcium chloride hydrate
and octadecane. Both would melt and solidify

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:38.839
within the temperature range of the environment,
but octadecane has a higher heat of fusion,

00:12:38.839 --> 00:12:44.239
which leads to greater potential energy savings.
While it is beyond the scope of this video,

00:12:44.239 --> 00:12:48.220
we also need to think about the heat transfer
properties of the other building materials

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:53.329
used in the roof and the cost and stability
of the phase change materials.

00:12:53.329 --> 00:12:59.019
Today, you learned about the concept of latent
heat and how the energy transformations that

00:12:59.019 --> 00:13:04.769
occur during a phase change are a consequence
of the law of conservation of energy. You

00:13:04.769 --> 00:13:10.379
also saw how engineers have used the concept
of latent heat to design phase change materials

00:13:10.379 --> 00:13:16.610
that can allow us to cool and heat homes more
efficiently. The incorporation of phase change

00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:21.739
materials in building materials is still an
active area of research. There are still engineering

00:13:21.739 --> 00:13:27.220
challenges to address, perhaps by you, in
order to make these technologies cost-effective

00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:31.640
and more widely used.

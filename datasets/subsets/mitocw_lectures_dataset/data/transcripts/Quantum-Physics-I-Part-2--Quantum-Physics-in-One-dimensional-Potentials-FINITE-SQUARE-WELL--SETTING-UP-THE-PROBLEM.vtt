BARTON ZWIEBACH:
Finite square well.

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.620
So this brings us also
to a little common aside.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.700
So far, we could
find every solution.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.650
Now we're going to write the
equations for the finite square

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.375
well, and we're not going to
be able to find the solution.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.940
But we're going to
understand the solution.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.860
So you're going to
enjoy a little--

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.670
mathematicians usually say
it's the most important thing,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.400
understanding the solution.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.920
Finding it, it's no big deal.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.360
But we're physicists as well.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.560
So we sometimes have
to find the solutions.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.680
Even if we don't
understand them very well,

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.900
it's nice to find them.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.670
And then you're going to
use numerical methods,

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.400
and this is the part
of the course where

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.910
you're going to be using
numerical methods a lot.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.860
Here is the finite
square well, and now we

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.770
draw it symmetrically.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.160
Here it is.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.830
Here is x.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.170
We're drawing the
potential V of x.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.440
It extends from a to minus a.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.210
It's 0.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.140
This is the 0 of the potential.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.323
It's here.

00:01:28.323 --> 00:01:31.090
And it goes down.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.990
The potential is negative here.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.400
Its value is minus
V0 with V0 positive.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.680
And then a possible energy
for a bound state-- we're

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.800
going to look for bound states.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.430
Bound states are normalizable
states, normalizable solutions

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.330
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.550
So we're going to look for them.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:09.009
Look for bound states.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.190
And they have
energy less than 0.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.580
So something that has
energy less than 0 is bound.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.140
You would have to give it some
energy to put it at 0 energy,

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.800
and the particle could escape.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.810
The other thing
about the bound state

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.440
is that it will be some
probability to find it here.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.360
Very little probability to find
it in the forbidden region.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.720
And this energy, which is
negative, it's somewhere here.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.060
We don't know what are
the possible energies,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.480
but we will assume there's
some energy that is negative,

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.450
that is there.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.870
And that's the energy
of the solution.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.280
Let me write the equation again.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:07.940
The equation is psi double prime
is minus 2m over h bar squared,

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.470
E minus V of x times psi.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.030
This is the
Schrodinger equation.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.910
You recognize it if you multiply
h squared here, 2m there.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.910
And we've been solving
already two examples where

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.630
there was no potential, but
finally, there is a potential.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.185
So this is the energy
of the particle.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.730
The energy of the
particle can be

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.750
interpreted as the potential
energy plus the kinetic energy.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.440
Think intuitively here.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.330
If you have some
energy over here--

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.120
this is the potential energy.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.325
Well, all this much
is kinetic energy.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.680
On the other hand,
in this region,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.200
the energy is smaller
than the potential energy.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:08.030
So it has negative kinetic
energy, which is classically

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.462
not understandable.

00:04:10.462 --> 00:04:12.940
And in quantum
mechanics, it just

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.670
will have some
probability of being here,

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.420
but that probability will
go down and eventually

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.525
go to 0 in such a way that the
wave function is normalizable.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.820
So this is a very mysterious
thing that happens here,

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.270
that the wave function
will not be just over here,

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.890
but it will leak.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.000
And it leaks because there's
a finite discontinuity.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.550
If you take the barrier
to be infinitely high,

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.310
it would leak so little that
eventually it would not leak.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:50.410
The wave function
would vanish there.

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:52.150
And it will be the
end of the story,

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.780
and you're back to the
infinite square well.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.530
So the infinite square
well is a limit of this

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.520
as V0 goes to minus infinity.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.600
OK, so a few numbers we
can put in this graph.

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.030
E, and this-- what is the
energy difference here?

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:25.920
It's E minus minus V0
, which is V0 plus E.

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.930
And many times
because E is negative,

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:35.120
we'll write it as V0
minus absolute value of E.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.060
A negative number is equal
to minus its absolute value.

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.650
So how about this
whole constant here?

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.750
Well, my tongue slipped,
and I said this constant,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.840
but it's V of x.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.830
So what do you mean a constant?

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.780
Well, the potential
is piecewise constant.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.610
So actually, we are not in
such difficult situation

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.930
because in this region, the
potential is a constant.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:12.520
In this region, the
potential is a constant.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.830
So this is the
constant here, and we

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.470
wish to understand
what it is and what

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.640
are the sines of this constant.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.305
This constant, that
we call alpha--

00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:28.020
see-- is going to be--

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.080
let's see what it is, the
different circumstances.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.820
Suppose you are here.

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:38.530
The energy is bigger
than the potential.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:42.060
So energy minus the
potential is positive,

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.830
and the constant is negative.

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:53.220
So alpha is negative
for x less than a.

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:56.070
If it's negative
and it's a constant,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:06:59.100
you're going to have
trigonometric solutions

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:03.230
for x, absolute value
less than a, so trig.

00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.410
On the other region,
alpha will be

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:21.520
positive for x greater
than a, and you will

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.339
have real exponentials of--

00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:33.380
I'll just write exponentials.

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:43.080
So E to the minus 3x, E to
the 5x, things like that.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.600
This is the difference
between trigonometric

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:50.350
and real exponential
solutions depend on the sines.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:59.020
So we're going to have to
impose boundary conditions as

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:02.750
well because we're going
to solve the equation here

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.180
inside with one value of
alpha and then outside

00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:09.130
with another value of alpha.

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:12.600
And then we're
going to match them.

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.190
So that's how this will go.

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:21.840
Now in this process,
somehow the energy

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:28.750
will be fixed to some
value, some allowed values.

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:31.570
There's a counting we could
do to understand that,

00:08:31.570 --> 00:08:34.770
and we'll probably
do it next time.

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.720
At this moment,
we'll just proceed.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:46.350
But we imagine there must
be a quantization because

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:49.770
in the limit as V0
goes to infinity

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:54.210
and the potential well
becomes infinitely deep,

00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:56.540
you're back to an
infinite square well

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.120
that has quantized energies
that we calculated.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:05.060
So that should be quantized,
and it should be no problem

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:08.010
OK, ready to do some work?

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:09.400
Let's-- Yes?

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:12.641
AUDIENCE: So when alpha is 0 and
you get polynomial solutions,

00:09:12.641 --> 00:09:14.500
does that case not matter?

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.280
BARTON ZWIEBACH: When
alpha is 0-- well,

00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:19.500
alpha is going to be never 0.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.370
You see, either E is
less than the potential

00:09:23.370 --> 00:09:25.450
or is better than the potential.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.170
So you're not going
to get alpha equals 0.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:36.450
You could say, do we have some
energy maybe here or here?

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:41.760
Well, you could have those
energies, in which case

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.160
you will see what happens.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.454
It's not quite
polynomial solutions.

00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.160
There's one property about
potentials that actually is

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:58.290
in the homework due this week,
which is that there cannot be

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:02.310
solutions of the Schrodinger
equation with less energy than

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:04.710
the minimum of the potential.

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.175
You have to have more
energy than the minimum

00:10:07.175 --> 00:10:09.780
of the potential.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:16.140
So alpha equal to 0 is not going
to show up in our analysis.

00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.960
OK, so let's begin.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:22.230
Moreover, we have
to use this result.

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:26.370
The potential is symmetric,
completely symmetric,

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:31.060
so there are going to be even
solutions and odd solutions.

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:33.262
So let's consider
the even solutions.

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:38.930
Solutions.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:40.770
So those are solutions.

00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:44.610
Psi of minus x is
equal to psi of x.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:52.070
Now, you will see how
I solve this thing now,

00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.520
and the lesson of all
of this is the relevance

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:59.690
of unit-free numbers.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:02.250
Unit-free numbers are going
to be your best friends

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.930
in solving these equations.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:08.460
So it will look like
I'm not solving anything

00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:12.570
except making more and
more definitions, and all

00:11:12.570 --> 00:11:16.640
of the sudden, the
solution will be there.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.920
And it's a power of
notation as well.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:23.160
This problem can be
very messy if you

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.960
don't have the right notation.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.160
If you were solving it alone,
if we would stop the lecture now

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:30.900
and you would go home,
you would probably

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.400
find something very
messy for quite a bit.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.030
And then maybe you clean
it up little by little,

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:39.160
and eventually,
something nice shows up.

00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.290
So here's what
we're going to do.

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:47.740
We're solving for x in between
a and minus a, even solutions.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:51.465
So what does the equation
look like? d second psi d

00:11:51.465 --> 00:12:01.170
x squared is minus 2m over
h squared E minus V of x--

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:04.350
in that region, the
potential is minus V0.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:14.080
So this is minus 2m
over h squared, V0

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:21.900
plus E, which I write as minus
absolute value of E, psi.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.170
And I forgot a psi here.

00:12:28.306 --> 00:12:28.805
OK.

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.620
V0 is positive.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:40.400
Minus V0 is going down, and V0
minus the absolute value of E

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.050
is positive.

00:12:42.050 --> 00:12:48.703
So this whole quantity
over here is positive.

00:12:48.703 --> 00:12:52.120
And here it comes,
first definition.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.100
I will define k squared
to be that quantity--

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:04.610
2m over h squared V0
minus absolute value of E.

00:13:04.610 --> 00:13:08.020
And that's greater
than 0 in this region,

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.270
as we're trying to solve, and
I'll call this equation one.

00:13:14.998 --> 00:13:19.680
And the differential
equation has become psi

00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.270
double prime is minus k psi.

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:27.570
So the solutions are simple.

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:32.360
It's trigonometrics, as we
said, and the only solution-- k

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.070
squared, I'm sorry.

00:13:34.070 --> 00:13:35.970
k squared-- and
the only solution

00:13:35.970 --> 00:13:39.120
that is possible, because
it's a symmetric thing,

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:41.520
is cosine of kx.

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:48.080
So psi of x is going
to be cosine of kx,

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.570
and that will hold
from a to minus a.

00:13:57.660 --> 00:14:01.290
End of story, actually, for
that part of the potential.

00:14:01.290 --> 00:14:04.200
You could ask-- one second.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.320
You could say, you're going
to normalize these things,

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.090
aren't you?

00:14:09.090 --> 00:14:13.830
Well, the fact that I
won't normalize them,

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:18.750
it's just a lot of work,
and it's a little messy.

00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.140
But that's no problem.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:25.610
You see, you're finding
energy eigenstates,

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:28.560
and by definition,
solving the differential

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.870
equation is not going to
give you a normalization.

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:36.300
So this is a good solution
of the differential equation,

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.550
and let's leave it at that.

00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:41.060
This we'll call solution two.

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:47.820
How about the region
x greater than a?

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.800
Well, what does the
differential equation look like?

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.230
Well, it looks like psi double
prime is equal to minus 2,

00:14:55.230 --> 00:15:08.070
m over h squared, E psi
because the potential is 0.

00:15:08.070 --> 00:15:12.170
V0 outside.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:15.122
x equals a.

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:21.310
And here again, you want
to look at the equation

00:15:21.310 --> 00:15:22.610
and know the sine.

00:15:22.610 --> 00:15:26.770
So maybe better to put
the absolute value here.

00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:34.230
So this is 2m absolute value
of E over h squared psi.

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.435
And one more definition--

00:15:36.435 --> 00:15:45.740
kappa squared is going
to be 2mE over h squared.

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:49.500
That's equation number three.

00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.930
The equation has become
psi double prime equals

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:03.190
kappa squared psi, and
the solutions for that

00:16:03.190 --> 00:16:05.990
are exponentials.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:12.650
Solutions are psi-- goes like
E to the plus minus kappa x.

00:16:12.650 --> 00:16:15.885
You see the solution we're
constructing is symmetric.

00:16:15.885 --> 00:16:17.240
It's even.

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.940
So let's worry just
about one side.

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.990
If one side works, the other
side will work as well.

00:16:24.990 --> 00:16:31.550
So I will just write
that for psi of x

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:34.760
is equal to the minus kappa x.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.170
That's a solution
for x greater than a.

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:44.690
If I just did that, I
would be making a mistake.

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:47.810
And the reason is
that yes, I don't

00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:51.510
care about the normalization
of the wave function,

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.100
but by not putting
a number here,

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.800
I'm selecting some
particular normalization.

00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.910
And The wave function must
be continuous and satisfy

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.990
all these nice things.

00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:07.069
So yes, here I can maybe
not put a constant,

00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:10.090
but here, already, I
must put a constant.

00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.880
It may be needed to match
the boundary conditions.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.920
I cannot ignore it here.

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:22.430
So I must put the constant
a that I don't know,

00:17:22.430 --> 00:17:25.140
and that's going to be
equation number four.

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:32.226
Now, look at your definitions.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.910
k squared for a
trigonometric, kappa--

00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:45.130
many people use kappa for things
that go with exponentials.

00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:48.930
But look, k squared
and kappa squared

00:17:48.930 --> 00:17:51.250
satisfy a very nice relation.

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.710
If you add them up--

00:17:54.710 --> 00:17:59.080
k squared plus kappa squared--

00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:04.840
the energy part cancels,
and you get 2mV0, which

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.250
is positive, over h squared.

00:18:09.250 --> 00:18:18.210
Well, that's not so bad, but we
want to keep defining things.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.590
How can I make this really nice?

00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:28.730
If it didn't have units,
it would be much nicer.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:31.190
This is full of units.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:36.855
k times a length has no units,
and kappa times a length

00:18:36.855 --> 00:18:38.420
has no unit.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.250
So multiply by a
squared, and you have k

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:46.400
squared a squared
plus kappa squared

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:52.780
a squared is equal to 2mV0
a squared over h squared.

00:19:03.690 --> 00:19:07.770
Now, say, well yes,
this looks nice.

00:19:07.770 --> 00:19:10.670
So let's make the
new definitions.

00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:17.740
So don't lose track
of what we are doing.

00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:19.230
We need to find the energy.

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.540
That's basically what we want.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:23.790
What are the possible energies?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:29.130
And we already included
two constants--

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:33.610
k and kappa- and they have
these properties here.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:45.370
So let me define
psi to be kappa a,

00:19:45.370 --> 00:19:47.830
and it will be defined
to be positive.

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:51.970
Kappa is defined to
be positive, and k

00:19:51.970 --> 00:19:53.630
is defined to be positive.

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:08.050
eta, you will define it to
be ka. a It's unit-free.

00:20:08.050 --> 00:20:08.580
No units.

00:20:11.838 --> 00:20:19.350
And from that equation,
now we have eta

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:25.270
squared plus psi squared is
equal to the right-hand side,

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:28.320
which I will call z0 squared.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.920
So z0 squared-- that's
another definition--

00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:38.400
is 2mV0 a squared
over h squared.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.670
This is the list of
your definitions.

00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:44.540
OK.

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:45.540
What did we do?

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:51.110
We traded kappa and k
that control the behavior

00:20:51.110 --> 00:20:54.200
of the wave function--
k inside the well,

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.600
kappa outside the well--

00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:02.010
we traded them for eta
and psi, unit-free.

00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:06.870
And a new constant came up, z0.

00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:07.670
What is z0?

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:13.535
Well, z0 is a very
interesting constant.

00:21:13.535 --> 00:21:17.420
It's a number that
you can construct out

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:20.900
of the parameters
of your potential.

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.780
It involves V0 and the width.

00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:28.760
If V0 is very
large, z0 is large.

00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:33.500
If the width is
very big, z0 is big.

00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:40.340
If the potential is shallow
or very narrow, z0 is small.

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:43.190
But the most important
thing about z0

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:48.550
is that it will give you
the number of bound states.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:52.440
If z0 is very big, it's
a very deep potential,

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.090
we'll have lots of bound states.

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:59.630
If z0 is very shallow, there
will be one bound state,

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.890
no more.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.540
You will see it today.

00:22:02.540 --> 00:22:05.990
But z0 controls the
number of bound states.

00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:08.760
And this is its role, and
it will be very important--

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.900
these dimensionless
quantities and number.

00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:16.940
If somebody says, I have a
potential with z0 equals 5,

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.010
you can tell immediately
three bound states

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:21.500
or some number of bound states.

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.430
That's the nice thing about z0.

00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.975
And this is a very
nice-looking equation,

00:22:25.975 --> 00:22:30.980
this equation of a circle
in the 8x psi plane.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
So in this last lecture,
what I'd like to do is I'd like to

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
now begin to talk about genetics.
And when we talked early on in the

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
semester I was showing you this way
that you can study biological

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
function.  Biochemists,
for the most part, study how

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
proteins work.
And what genetics does,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
steadying function, it's enable one
to discover genes.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And the molecular biology that we're
going to be talking about in the

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
back part of the course has been
really totally amazing because it's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
allowed one to go back and forth
between genes and proteins,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
something that used to be very,
very hard until recombinant DNA came

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
into the picture.
Now, up until now I've sort of

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
mentioned genetics
as we went along.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
But we haven't really talked about
it as a discipline and the kind of

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
power that this experimental
approach has.  Thank you.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I could have done this without
notes but it's easier to have them.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
I just have my little help here.
So I know some of you have written

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
in your comments I didn't think
there was going to be

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so much chemistry.
Well, we had a little bit of a bout

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
with chemistry.
And then some of you found that we

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
were going away from bonds and
thinking about 3-dimensionality,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
and that was another kind of
thinking.  And then sort of trying

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
to work through the genetic code is
almost another.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
And I think you'll find here,
as we start to go through genetics

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
that you have to stretch your brain
in another direction.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And part of one of the really
interesting things about biology

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
today is you cannot just sort of
think about it in one kind of very

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
comfortable way of thinking and
really take advantage of everything

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that's out there.
You need to be able to talk in

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
multiple languages and multiple
disciplines.  And so today I want to

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
just kind of briefly give you an
introductory sense of how genetics,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that I hope will give you, let you
see the power of it by very,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
very simple techniques.  And
remember what you're doing here is

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
you're studying variants of the
living organism.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
So if you see something that's
wrong with it you know it's

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
important, but you know the rest of
the job is to figure out what's

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
wrong.  And I've sort of given you
and used some examples.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
When we talked about the
streptococcus with the smooth

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
colonies, I talked about how people
had noticed rough colonies.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Well, those sorts of things had
been a change in the DNA and they

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
weren't making these polysaccharide
capsules anymore.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Or when I talked to you about the
mutant bacteria that had lost

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
mismatch repair,
they had a high mutation frequency

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
compared to a wild type.
So up until now I've sort of

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
mentioned them,
but we haven't really talked about

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
how one goes about studying things
in a systematic genetic way.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So let me begin with just a few
definitions.  I realize this is a

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
little dry but we need to make sure
that we're all on the same page in

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.000
terms of the language.
So a mutant is a variant of a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:28.000
normal organism.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
It has a change in its DNA and the
kinds of mutants can vary all over

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
the map.  For example,
if we had an E. coli that was,

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000
we might call it penn-resistant,
that could mean it was resistant to

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
penicillin and would grow in the
presence of the antibiotics.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Whereas, ordinary ones would die.
Or if we had what we call a

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
his-minus mutant broken in the
biosynthesis of histidine

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:07.000
won't grow --

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
-- unless you add histidine to the
medium.  Those are a couple of

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
simple examples.
When we start right after lecturing,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000
when I come back,
I'm going to begin with Mendel,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.000
which is the more classic and usual
way of teaching genetics.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And he used various traits of peas.
Yellow and green seeds and wrinkled

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
and round.  And you can see what he
was working with there.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Another favorite organism for
genetic study has been the fruit fly

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:46.000
or drosophila.
You can even see that they have red

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
eyes.  If you take a close look next
time if one lands on your sandwich

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
or your drink or something in the
summer.  But you can see,

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
for example, people were able to get
white mutants that have white eyes.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
There's something broken in making
the pigment that's going to make it

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
red.  Here's an even weirder one.
This is a single mutation in

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
drosophila.  It affects a
developmental process instead of

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
something else.
And what happens is this is a

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
drosophila head.
And normally there are antennae

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000
that grow out of the top of the head.
And you can see what's happened in

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000
this mutant is there's a pair of
legs growing out of the top of the

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000
head.  It's just a single gene
that's been changed,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
but it's a gene that plays a role in
the developmental program,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
the patterning that makes certain
cells become specialized to become

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
certain other things.
So it's just to give you an idea.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
And I showed you these.  We've
talked about the xeroderma

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000
pigmentosum, one change.
A person with this has got a gene

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
that's broken in dealing with damage
from UV.  Or I've given you an

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
example of what they call Werner
syndrome where a change in a single

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
gene, it's actually a kind of gene
whose proteins are involved in

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
unwinding DNA,
of all things, can give you this

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000
premature aging phenotype where the
woman looks normal at 16 but older

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000
at the age of 48.
So all of these are,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.000
if you will, mutants that are a
variant of a wild type.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:25.000
And then this is something people
often get confused between these two

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
terms.  The mutation is the actual
change in the DNA.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Now, one other thing that's sort of
implicit in this definition is that

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
we know what a normal organism is.
Well, if you look around this room,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
what's a normal human?  Well, I'm OK
but I don't know about the rest of

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
you.  I'm sure we all feel that way,
but we have a lot of variation in it.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
So, to some extent,
it's an operational definition.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
And most often it's applied, if
you're studying something like

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000
drosophila or E.
coli, someone has been propagating a

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000
particular bacterial isolate in the
lab for a long time.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
And you call that one the wild type,
even though, in fact, in the case of

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
an E. coli, it may have changed a
bit so it likes to grow in the

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
conditions that it finds in the lab.
But this sort of normal is an

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
operational definition.
Now, another important term that

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:29.000
geneticists use all the time is the
phenotype.  The word phenotype.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And that's the ensemble --

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:45.000
-- of observable characteristics --

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000
-- of an organism.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:01.000
For example, in these resistance to

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000
penicillin would be an example of a
phenotype.  A mutant that had

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000
acquired the resistance would have
the phenotype of being resistant.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Sometimes these phenotypes can be a
little subtle.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
A conditional phenotype would be a
phenotype that you could observe

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:31.000
under one characteristic
and not in another.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
For example, a temperature
sensitive phenotype --

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Whatever it might be.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:52.000
For example, it could be wild type
at let's say 30 degrees but mutant

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:58.000
at 37 degrees centigrade.
That may sound like a sort of

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
fiddly little thing.
Why am I telling you about a

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
conditional phenotype right off?
Well, suppose you wanted to study a

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
DNA polymerase.
be it E. coli or me,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
and it's the one that replicates
your DNA?  If we get a mutant that

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
just kills, knocks out the activity
of the gene we have no living

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
organism to study,
we cannot do any genetics.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
But you can work around that.
You can do genetics with essential

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000
functions if you get a mutant where
you see the mutant phenotypes,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000
let's say, at the high temperature
but not at a low temperature.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000
And what that kind of thing usually
comes from is a change in the

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
protein where the protein has one
amino acid changed to something else

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
and it folds up,
and at the lower temperature it's

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
able to fold up and do its thing.
But it's not quite as stable as the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
original protein.
And if you raise the temperature it

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
unfolds a bit,
and once it unfolds it doesn't work

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
or it gets degraded or something
like that.  OK.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
So that's phenotype.
The genotype then refers to the

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000
state of the organism's genetic
material with respect to whether its

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:19.000
wild type differs from it.
So let me just put that down.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:27.000
So this refers to the state --

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.000
-- of the organism's

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:42.000
genetic material --

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000
-- with respect to whether it's wild
type or it's mutant.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
There's a key distinction,
even though they sort of sound the

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:54.000
same.  This is what you can see if
you look at it but this is what's

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000
actually changed.
The genotype is what's actually

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000
changed in the DNA.
And there's a caution.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000
If it's something like a bacterium
it's fine because it's only got one

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
copy of every gene.
If I knock out a gene for making

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
histidine it cannot make histidine.
The genotype and the phenotype are

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000
the same.  But if you have a diploid
organism, which is the kind of

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000
organism that we are and peas are
and fruit flies are,

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.000
there are two copies of most genes,
one from mom and one from dad.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
And the only exceptions are the ones
involved with the sex chromosomes.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Then you can get to something else,
a more complicated situation.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Because let's say we have a usual
thing where both copies of the gene

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:56.000
are plus, then the phenotype is wild
type, but if we were to break one of

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:03.000
those copies by a mutation this one
is still wild type.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000
The phenotype is still its wild type.
You cannot tell from looking at it

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.000
that this one is different than that
one.  And one of the really

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:19.000
brilliant insights that Mendel had
when he was looking at peas was he

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000
would take things that were wrinkled
and round and crossed them and he'd

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
see mixtures of things.
And he realized some of those things

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
in there weren't the same as either
the parents but they resembled one

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
of the parents.
And I'll take you through that in

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
the next thing.
So it's just a caution at the

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
moment that you have to be careful
that phenotype and genotype are not

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
always the same.
And then I've used the word gene.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:13:00.000
That's the discrete unit --

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000
-- of genetic information.
We talked the other day about the

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:10.000
lacZ gene that encodes
beta-galactosidase.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000
OK.  So I think what I'd like to do,
if I tell you,

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
for example, we made a lot of
mutants of E. coli that were broken

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
by the biosynthesis of histidine and
gave them to you,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
if you were a good biochemist you
might be able to work out how they

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
differed by studying
them biochemically.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
And let me just sort of give you a
sense of how that would work so you

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000
can see histidine or any of these
amino acids.  They're sort of

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000
complicated and they have to be
built up by a sequence of

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
biochemical steps with one enzyme
catalyzing each step in the pathway.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
And when people started out trying
to study that kind of thing they

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000
didn't know how it was made.
All they knew was what the end

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.000
product was.
And furthermore it was more of a

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
biosynthetic challenge even then
trying to work out the steps of

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
glycolysis because actually quite a
reasonable proportion of the protein

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
in any cell is devoted towards
making energy.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
So, relatively speaking,
there's a fair amount of the protein.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Each of those proteins that are
enzymes that we learned about,

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
for example, in glycolysis in a cell,
if you crack a cell open they're

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
made in larger quantities.
However, all the biosynthetic

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
enzymes, the things for making amino
acids, for making purines,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000
pyrimidines, nucleotides or vitamins,
which are only needed tiny amounts,

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
there are only little tiny bits of
those enzymes.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
So trying to work out the
biosynthetic pathways for how those

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
things were made was much more
difficult.  And it was helped by

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
genetics in the following way.
I'm not going to go into any great

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000
detail, but if you imagine that
there's a pathway for making

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
histidine.  We don't
know what it is.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
But we know that the end product is
histidine.  We could get mutants.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000
His-minus mutants, which I've said
up there, have the property of

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:20.000
growing only if you add histidine.
So if we had just a minimal glucose

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:26.000
plate, just some salts with glucose
and we were to streak a wild type

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
bacterium on it, it would
grow just fine.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000
But if we had a his-minus mutant on
a minimal glucose plate and we

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
streaked it out,
it couldn't grow because it couldn't

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
make histidine.
If it couldn't make histidine it

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000
couldn't make proteins.
But if we take the same plate,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000
minimal glucose plus some histidine,
now this same mutant will grow

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
fine.
And that's how we could tell that it

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000
was specifically broken in making
histidine.  So if you were to go

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
into a undergrad lab,
and I won't talk for the moment on

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
how you would isolate those
his-minus bacteria,

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000
it's not hard, you can do it in an
undergrad lab,

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000
you can make a whole lot of mutants
that were broken in making histidine.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
So one of the sort of things
biochemists could do was they didn't

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
know what the intermediates were,
but let's just say there's

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:31.000
intermediate-1,
intermediate-2, intermediate-3,

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000
intermediate-4 and intermediate-5.
And finally it goes to histidine.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Well, if we break the gene that
makes that, what will happen in that

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
pathway is the cell will make this
intermediate, this intermediate,

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000
and then this one will kind of build
up.  And, furthermore,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000
if I'm able to figure out what
intermediate-4 is,

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000
if I add intermediate-4 to this
mutant it will grow because the

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
defect was earlier in the pathway.
And if I added intermediate-1 it

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
won't grow.  And so by sort of using
very fine features of the phenotype,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:14.000
I mean getting in there, breaking it
open and discovering when

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000
intermediate was up,
or I could add an intermediate back

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
and forth, sort of playing with the
phenotype you can learn a lot about

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:29.000
the mutants that you've isolated and
so on.  But genetics as --

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000
And we'll sort of go into this just
a little bit more.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
But genetics as a science is able
to figure out whether mutations are

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
in the same genes and work out their
order without having to do any of

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000
these sort of specialized knowledge
of a phenotype.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.000
It's a very general,
very powerful way of doing business.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000
And I want to show you that.  I
want to use a system where we can

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
see this very clearly.
And I want to introduce you to a

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000
bacterial virus.
The idea of a bacterial virus,

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000
which are called bacteriophage, but
it's just a bacterial virus.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
And what's a bacteriophage?
Well, it's got a protein coat of

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
some kind.  They don't all look the
same, but just some of them look

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
like this.  So this is protein and
this is DNA.  That's it genetic

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
material.  And it's basically a
syringe.  It's got a coat and it's

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
got stuff that will let it find a
bacterial host.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
And it's able to squirt its DNA
from the bacterium into the host.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
So if we take,
for example, an E.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
coli cell and this phage,
which I'm drawing not to scale,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.000
it would be smaller than this
relative to the bacterium.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000
If it were to infect, it would
inject its DNA into the E.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000
coli cell.  And what it's sort of
done is it's put a bunch of new

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000
genetic information into a cell
that's all capable of making

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.000
RNA and proteins.
And so it kind of reprograms the

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
cell in the way I'm going to show
you in a minute.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
So when this new DNA comes in,
this is the E. coli DNA.  And the

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
virus kind of takes over the cell.
And what it does is it makes it

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
into a machine or a factor for
making baby virus,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
if you will.  So first it makes
phage DNA.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
And then it also makes the proteins
that self-assemble to give [its code?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
.  So it's kind of reprogrammed the
cell.  And some of the viruses that

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
infect our cells are essentially
doing the same thing.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
They stick their genetic material
into our cells and it takes over.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000
So unlike the retrovirus that we
were talking about,

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000
this thing is not inserting its DNA
into the genome of the host.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000
It's just using the cell as a
factory for making more of its own.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:15.000
So then these assemble so that the
host has now got phage inside it

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:23.000
like this.  And the cells then lice,
which means that they burst open.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:31.000
The phage, once it's done all of
this, makes a special enzyme that

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.000
degrades the bacterial cell wall.
And it makes the cell pop open.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:46.000
And it releases these free phage.
And if you start with one of them

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.000
you might get,
for example, 150 coming out of the

00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:02.000
cell when it bursts.
And then each one of these is able

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.000
to grab hold of another uninfected E.
coli and start the cycle again.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
And the cycle takes usually
something like 20 to 30 minutes for

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
a bacteriophage.
So it's pretty quick.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000
One phage absorbing to a bacterium,
injecting its DNA can make that 150

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:29.000
copies of itself in about 20 minutes,
and then each of those can infect.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000
So how would you detect something
like this?  Well,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:40.000
the trick that's done is pretty
simple.  You take something like ten

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
to the eighth bacteria.
Let's say you have some bacteria in

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:51.000
a test tube and then maybe let's say
ten to the two phage,

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000
and then you spread it on just a
Petri plate that the bacteria

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
can grow on.
So there are many,

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000
many bacteria.  So they're just
going to sort of grow up and form

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000
kind of a wand that will cover the
whole plate.  And if you were to

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.000
hold it up to the light you'd see
it's sort of opaque now because the

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
bacteria have grown up.
But anywhere there was a phage to

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
start out with,
a single phage it would infect its

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
original cell,
the cell would burst open,

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
it would release 150 phage,
they'd infect the nearest 150

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
bacteria, they'd break open.
And so what happens is the bacteria

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.000
trying to grow and cover the plate,
the phage are growing and eating all

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
the bacteria.  Basically at least
using up all the bacteria in that

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.000
area.  So what you get from this are
little holes in the ìlawnî,

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
and they're called a plaque.
That's the technical term.  Here.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000
And so it's actually very easy to
see how many phage you have because

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000
you just put them out on a plate.
And I realize this might sound

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000
slightly fanciful.
There is a textbook picture of a

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
bacteriophage with the DNAs all
packaged up in the head.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
It's got a sheath.  It's got little
things that will let it recognize a

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
particular host.
And it really does look like a

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000
syringe.  And it's got stuff that
squirts, basically the mechanics to

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000
squirt the DNA in.
There's an electron micrograph.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
So that's a real one.  This is not
just a textbook cartoon.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
It's a pretty accurate depiction.
This was a little thing.  This is

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.000
cycling, so don't get it mixed up.
This only happens once.  But this

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:42.000
is basically depicting the idea that
the DNA starts out in the phage and

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
then it gets injected into the cell.
And once it's in the cell the empty

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
coat, it doesn't have anything else
to do in this story,

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:55.000
but the DNA takes over.
And then you get, after a little

00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:00.000
while, when you've made these
progeny phage the cell breaks open.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
And if you assay them,
this is just a picture one of my

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
post-docs made for me.
I think you can see here's a lawn.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
You can sort of see how it's opaque
and you can see those little holes.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
There were probably a thousand or
so phage that were put on this plate.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.000
There are several hundred anyway.
And you can just count the number

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
of holes and then you know how many
phage you've got.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
OK?  So that's this system.
Now, what I'd like to now consider

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
is how we could use genetics to try
and study the essential functions of

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000
that bacteriophage.
How does it replicate?

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
How does it make its coat?
I want to study the things that are

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
needed for it to be a phage,
not something that's dispensable.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I want to know essential functions.
So that means I would have to use

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
conditional mutants of some type so
that I could study it because

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
otherwise if I broke something that
was critical for the phage's life

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
cycle I'd never get any phage and I
couldn't do any genetics.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000
So what I would do is I would look
for temperature sensitive mutants.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:23.000
The phage.  So they'll form plaques,

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:34.000
let's say plaques at 30 degrees.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000
No plaques at 37 degrees.
And you go through, and you could

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.000
be laborious or cleaver depending on
how you set this up.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000
But we could make a bunch of
mutants.  And let's call T1,

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
T2, just give them names like that
as I isolate them.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Now, what I want to show you are
two absolutely standard and critical

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
genetic ways of analyzing
these mutants.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
They all look the same.
Their phenotype is they form

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000
plaques at 30 degrees.
They don't form plaques at 37

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
degrees.  They could be affecting
one gene.  We could have mutants in

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
50 genes.  I don't know starting out.
All I know is I've got mutants that

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
are temperature sensitive.
So genetics gives you a couple of

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
ways of going at that that will tell
you not only are they in the same

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
gene or in the different gene.
But it also will tell you something

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:36.000
about their physical relationship
along the DNA.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:42.000
And this is without knowing
anything about what they do.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.000
So let me show you how that works.
So the first genetic operation is

00:26:47.000 --> 00:27:00.000
called a complementation test.

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000
And the thing that I hope will
strike you about particularly these

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
bacteriophage things is these are so
simple.  I've already told you

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
basically all the techniques we're
going to be using.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
We're going to be taking phage,
we're going to be mixing it with

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
bacteria, we're going to be putting
them on a plate and we're going to

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
be counting plaques.
But we're not going to do anything

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
else and we're going to learn stuff
about whether mutations are in the

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
same gene or different genes,
between different mutants and

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000
something about the order of the
genes on the chromosome.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.000
And that's the point I'm trying to
drive home right now.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:41.000
So here's the first idea.
Let's add the T1 mutant plus the T2

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:48.000
mutant to some bacteria.
So we'll put them both into the

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000
same test tube.
And what we want is enough phage --

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:06.000
So every bacterium gets both.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:12.000
So we want to take, if we take T1
by itself it will grow plagues at 30

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000
degrees, not at 37.
T2 plaques at 30 degrees,

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000
no plaques at 37.  Now we're going
to take some bacteria and put enough

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000
that both of them will get
into the same thing.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Now, of course,
those bacteria are doomed because if

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000
anything happens,
because they've got things inside

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000
them.  So what we do now is then we
add a whole bunch of what we would

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
call indicator bacteria.
These are ones that haven't been.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000
And we'll put lots of those in, and
we'll put many fewer of these and

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:02.000
we'll mix these together.
And then we'll plate them out under

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
two different conditions.
Let's try it at 30 degrees.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Well, in that case, I think we can
figure out what would happen.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000
Both T1 and T2 can form plaque,
so you'd expect to see plaques.  And

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000
you would indeed see that if you did
this experiment.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Now, the other thing,
though, this is where it gets

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000
interesting, is what would happen if
we plated them at 37 degrees?

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Well, on their own neither of them
can form a plaque.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:38.000
But we've engineered it so that
there are two within each bacterium.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:44.000
So there are two possible outcomes,
and let's think what they could be.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000
We could either have mutations in
the same gene that some particular

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:56.000
gene, let's say a gene required for
making the major protein in the coat,

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.000
that mutant one is affected in that
gene and mutant two is affected in

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000
the same protein.
So both of them got a broken coat

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
protein.  And so inside this
bacterium, when the phage are trying

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
to grow, what you've got is this one
gene.  And this is the T1 mutant and

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
this is the T2 mutant.
And maybe this one has got a

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000
mutation somewhere and the other one
has got it somewhere else in the

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000
gene, but this gene
is not functional.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
So we wouldn't get any plaques.
But what if they were in different

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:47.000
genes?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Let's say one of the mutants was
altered in the gene for a coat

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
protein and the other one was
altered in a gene that was necessary

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000
for replicating the phage DNA.
So it's a situation like this.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:08.000
And let's say this is gene A and
that's gene B.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000
What do you think could happen now?
Get plaques?  Wouldn't get plaques?

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Yeah?  I see a lot of nodding.
We'd get plaques because this one

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
has a good gene A,
so it would make let's say the coat

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
protein.  This one has a good gene B
so it could make the DNA polymerase

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000
for copying the phage DNA.
And things would be fine.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.000
And so by this very, very simple
test, we could take a whole lot of

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:45.000
TS mutants and we could go through
in a pare-wise fashion,

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
and we could say oh, I see,
number one, number seven and number

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
54 apparently affect all mutations
affecting one gene,

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
and we could put them into
categories by doing this.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
And we haven't done anything other
than mix phage and bacteria and look

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000
to see whether they're plaques or
not.  I mean this is very different

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
than what a biochemist does.
It's a different kind of thinking.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
And yet it's enormously powerful.
So this procedure,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000
which is one of the workhorses of a
geneticist, is known as a

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000
complementation test.
And depending on the organism it

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
takes a whole bunch of different
sort of technical forms.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:36.000
But that's the principle of the
thing, that if you have one good

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000
copy of the gene and a broken one
then you can survive in most cases

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000
because usually the one will be
enough to get you through here.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:51.000
So that's one of the things that
geneticists do.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And see how powerful it is for
something that's a very

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000
simple manipulation.
But let me now tell you the other

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:08.000
kind of test that geneticists do.
It's a slightly different principle

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:15.000
but just as powerful and gives you a
different kind of information.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:22.000
This is known as a recombination
test.  So what we're going to do in

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000
this case now is we're going to
allow two mutants to grow together

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:36.000
in the same cell.
Let's say two mutants.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:45.000
And we'll use T1 and T2 again to
grow together in the same cell.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Now, for example, remember up here
we mixed both of them in this so

00:33:53.000 --> 00:34:02.000
they both were inside this bacteria
and then when we plated it up,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.000
up here at 30 degrees we got plaques?
We would have gotten plaques from

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000
every single infected bacteria.
Well, those plaques probably have

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000
ten to the ninth phage in them.
And those were phage that grew

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000
together under permissive conditions.
OK?  So let's take those,

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:33.000
re-suspend them --

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000
-- and bring them over here.
Now, we'll add them to some

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:43.000
bacteria.  So bacteria in here.
But we're going to do it under

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.000
different conditions now.
We don't want complementation

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
taking place, so we'll make sure
that we have less than one phage --

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:03.000
-- per bacterium.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:09.000
So we cannot do this
complementation thing anymore.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:16.000
We just got rid of it by using a
different ratio of phage to the

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:23.000
bacteria.  So now what I want to do,
I'm going to plate this out at 37

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:30.000
degrees.  We could add an indicator
if we wanted again.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Well, that may seem like a stupid

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
experiment in the sense that T1
wouldn't grow by itself and T2

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
wouldn't grow by itself at 37
degrees.  And all I've done is let

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000
them grow together.
So if all we had in that population

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:57.000
was what we started with there
wouldn't be any plaques.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:02.000
But if you do that what you will
find is you'll find

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:12.000
some rare plaques.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:18.000
And these are what are known as
recombinants.  And let me now just

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:24.000
give you a sense of how these
recombinants arise.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000
So let's imagine that this is the
mutation and here's

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000
our T1 bacterium.
Here's its DNA.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:41.000
And let's say there's a function
here that it's wild type for and

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000
it's got a mutation down here.
The other one, T2 has got the

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:53.000
mutation here but it's wild type for
there.  That's the kind of thing we

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000
were talking about,
a gene A and a gene B,

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
although it's more general than that.
But what happens when these things

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
are growing together is under rare
circumstances this interesting thing

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:15.000
happens.  Since this is the two
strands of DNA and since these

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:21.000
phages are almost identical and this
piece of DNA is the same as that

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
piece of DNA.  And if a break every
happened in one of these strands,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:32.000
what can happen is it can invade the
other strand and displace it.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:38.000
And this strand can do a little
switcheroo and come over here like

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:45.000
this.  So now we've got the plus and
the plus and the minus and the minus.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:52.000
So this is an intermediate but
these things happen.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000
You get little breaks in DNA from
DNA damage and other things.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
And the other piece of DNA can go
off and pioneer and find another

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
molecule.  And then there are
enzymes that resolve this.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
And if we cut it right here,
we'd just go back to what we had

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
before.  But if you cut this strand
here, and you may have to sit down

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
and draw this out because this,
for me, was not intuitive when I was

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
learning this thing.
You'll see what happens now.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
The end of this strand will go over
and join to there.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
The end of this strand will join
and go here.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:32.000
And what you will get out of that is
one phage that's got both of the

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
pluses and one of the phage that's
got both of the minuses.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.000
And I'll call this sort of T1,
T2 to indicate that it has got both

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:49.000
of the mutations.
So this would be what we could

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:55.000
detect over there.
That would be one of the rare wild

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
types.
And I'll assert to you that this guy

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
here has two mutations in
it instead of one.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:13.000
What's the phenotype of the one that

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
has both mutations?
It cannot grow.  It can make

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000
plaques at 30 degrees.
It cannot make plaques at 37.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
If I got up and said I'm sure this
phage has two mutations.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000
It has both T1 and T2 mutations in
it.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
And I say prove it to me.
Anybody see how you could do it

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:40.000
given what I've already told you?

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Exactly.  If I tried it in a
complementation test with T1 it

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:48.000
wouldn't compliment because both
would be broken in T1.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000
If I tried to complement T2 it
wouldn't work because it's broken in

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
T2.  And just by using these tiny
little simple manipulations that

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I've told you,
I can even see that something that

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:05.000
has got a double mutant we could
sort it out at the bench.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000
You could walk in and tell me the
next morning what the result was.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
In fact, phage grows so fast you
might even be able to do it in the

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000
morning and tell me before you went
home at night.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:21.000
So this is, as I say,
called a recombination test.

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000
And it's giving you a different
kind of information,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000
but it's an extraordinarily powerful
technique for another reason,

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000
is that the recombination frequency
can be measured.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:41.000
We'll call RF.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And this is the recombinants over
the total.  So,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
in our case, this would be the
number of wild type,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
plus the number of these double
mutants over the total of T1 plus

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
the total of T2,
which would be the dominant members

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
of this population.
Because this is a relatively rare

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:10.000
event, plus the wild type,
plus the T1, T2.  And the thing that

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:17.000
is so useful is the probability of,
geneticists call this a crossover,

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:24.000
this kind of crossover happening is
proportional to the distance between

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:30.000
these things.
If they're a very long distance

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
apart there's a lot of DNA,
and the chances of it happening are

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
much higher than if the two
mutations are very close together.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
It makes sense just from First
Principles.  So the recombination

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:52.000
frequency varies as the distance --

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000
-- between the mutations.
So let's imagine that I do a cross

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:05.000
like this.
We'd grow T1 plus T2 and we measure

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:11.000
the recombination frequency,
and I find that it's 4%.  4% of the

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000
plaques are mutants out of
everything that's in there.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.000
And let me try another one.
I'll take T2 and I'll cross it with

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:29.000
the next mutant phage of isolated T3.
And let's say,

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:35.000
in this case, the recombination
frequency is 5%.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Because I know they're different
distances, but if you think about it

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:45.000
you'll realize there are two kinds
of maps we can draw.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
These data are compatible with the
gene order being one,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:55.000
two, with this being a distance that
corresponds to a 4% recombination

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:00.000
frequency, and three with this being
the distance that corresponds

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000
to the 5%.
But it's also compatible,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
isn't it, with this where we have
one, two and three here.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
There's the 4%.  And from there to
there is the 5%.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Yeah, that's right.
Two to three.  One to two is 4% and

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000
two to three is 5%
in both of these.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:36.000
One to two is 4%.
What did I do wrong?

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Two.  I guess I've got to do it
this way, two,

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:51.000
one.  Is that going to do it?
What did I do with my example here?

00:43:51.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Yeah.  Hang on a second.  OK.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Let's go back to where I was and see
if I can reconstruct this.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
OK.  There's one, and two is 4%,
and we want two to three 5%.  OK,

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:13.000
right.  So it's going to be here.
Here we go.  Two to three.  Excuse

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
me.  It's got to be farther over
here.  There's three.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:25.000
There's the 5%.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:32.000
OK.  Now we've got it,
once I change these numbers.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000
The 4%, the 5%,
the 4%, the 5%.  OK.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:44.000
I thought I was over this cold.
I guess I'm not quite over this

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:50.000
cold.  OK.  Could you devise an
experiment that would distinguish

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000
between those maps?
Yeah?  Yeah.  You've got it.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Take T1 and T3.
One of those you'll get a 9%.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:08.000
One of them you'll get a 1%.  Isn't
that amazing?  I mean it's so simple,

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000
but I think you can perhaps see some
of the power of genetics here.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:19.000
All we've done is we've got things
that we know can form plaques at 30

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:25.000
and not at 37.
We haven't done anything other than

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:31.000
mix them with bacteria and
then count plaques.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
And we've been able to make
inferences in a living organism

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
about mutations in genes that are
absolutely essential for that

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
organism to grow.
So what phage geneticists were able

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
to do over the years then was they
would make a map of all of these

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:53.000
different genes down to the phage
genome and then the biochemist would

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:57.000
go in and work it out.
And people studying mice would make

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
maps of genes along mice.
And it's only been in the last

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
handful of years we've been able to
go in and sequence the DNA and find

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
out where all of these things are.
So I will see you guys after.  I

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
hope you have a wonderful spring
break.  And I think you'll really

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
enjoy hearing Penny.
And we'll start in on diploid

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
genetics and Mendel and stuff as
soon as we get back.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
OK?  So see you in a little bit.

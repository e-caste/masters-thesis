00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.960
We'd like to consider
a system of particles.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.200
Let's say we have object one.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.440
We'll call this the
j-th object, object n.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.460
And somewhere in this system of
particles is a center of mass.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.240
Now, we know that
the external force

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.680
is causing the momentum
of the system to change,

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.510
and what we'd now
like to show is

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.520
that we can reduce
this system to

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.630
an effective single particle.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.220
The way we'll do that is recall
that the momentum of the system

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.670
is given by the sum of
the individual momentums.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.950
We'll call that the
j-th particle where

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.370
we're summing j from 1 to n.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.330
And that's the sum
of the momentums

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.040
of the various particles.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.220
Now when you
differentiate the momentum

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.830
of the system with
respect to time,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:59.490
we're just differentiating
the velocity.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.670
And so that becomes
the acceleration

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.230
of the j-th particle.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.130
Now we saw when we
define the center of mass

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:08.660
that the acceleration
of the center

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.960
of mass times the total
mass of the system

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.530
was equal to the sum of mj aj.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.890
j goes from 1 to n.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.460
So we see that
another way to think

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.480
about how the momentum of the
system of particles is changing

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.750
is simply the total mass
times the acceleration

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.820
of the center of mass.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.770
And our combination of
Newton's second and third law

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.920
now becomes that only
the external forces

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.590
cause the momentum of the
system to change so that's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.960
equal to the total mass times
the acceleration of the center

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.039
of mass.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:55.340
Now what does this
equation really mean?

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.140
So let's draw our
pictures again.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.140
Here's our system.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.810
We have particles 1, et cetera.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.110
That's the j-th
particle, n particles.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.259
And in here is the
center of mass.

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.680
Now I'm going to outline
my system like this

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.240
and what this
equation is telling

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.220
us is that we can just focus
by putting all of the mass

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.750
and total at the center of mass.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.770
And that center of
mass is going to move

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.180
according to some trajectory.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.780
And all we have
to think about is

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:47.850
this is a point particle
of total mass m, m total.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.350
So what we've done is we've
done a very important reduction.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.050
We've taken a complicated
system of particles

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.230
and reduced it to a
single point particle

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.780
of total mass m located at cm.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.390
And the dynamics of
that total particle

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.010
is if there is external
force acting on this system,

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.520
we place this external
force at the center of mass.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.030
And now we can calculate
the acceleration

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.760
of the center of mass is just
that external force divided

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.650
by the total mass.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.520
And that's how we can reduce
this complicated system

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:36.360
of particles to a translational
motion of the center of mass.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.489
Now we still cannot describe
the individual interactions

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.780
in the system, but we're not
trying to do that anymore.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.500
We're not trying to trace
how each particle moves.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.170
We're just looking at as our
system is a point particle

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.110
and talking about how
that point-like object is

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.300
translating the space.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.880
And this is a powerful
tool that we use again

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.647
and again and again.

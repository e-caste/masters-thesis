00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.080
PROFESSOR: This is our
first introductory meeting

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.380
of the course, which is 9.04.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.100
And we are going to cover vision
and audition in this course,

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.550
and there are going to
be two of us lecturing.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.950
My name is Peter Schiller,
and this is Chris Brown.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.280
And I will be talking
about the vision portion,

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.070
and Chris will be lecturing
about the auditory portion.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.850
Now, what I'm going
to do is I'm going

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:04.230
to hand out the syllabi
that we have, in this case,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.410
for the first half
of the course.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.150
And that we are going to
discuss in some detail

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.630
today for the first
half of the lecture,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.920
and Chris is going to discuss
it for the second half.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.090
So that is the basic
plan for today.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.500
And I will go through some of
the basic procedures and issues

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.330
that we may want to deal with at
this very introductory portion.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.770
So first of all, let me talk
about the reading assignments.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.480
If you have the handout,
they are ready for you.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.170
If you look at the
second page, that's

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.570
where we have the assigned
readings for the vision

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.445
half of the course.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.780
Now, for that half
of the course,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.140
the top eight assignments
are all articles

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.440
in various journals.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.455
We don't have a textbook for
this portion of the course.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.560
And then in addition to
the assigned readings,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.850
we have recommended readings
that are listed there.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.820
And then another
important factor

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.630
that is listed
there-- let me first

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.150
say that the lectures will be
put on Stellar, in most cases,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.380
after each lecture.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:45.120
And in addition, the videos
that we are now recording

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.850
will also become available,
but they will not

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.240
be available until well
after each lecture.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.590
So I would advise each of
you to come to the lectures

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.840
rather than hoping to read
the assigned material only

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.610
or to eventually
look at the videos.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.650
The reason I'm
telling you this is

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.620
that our analysis has shown
that those students who

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.310
attend the lectures
regularly get

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.180
much better grades on the exams
than the students who do not.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.550
So I strongly will
urge all of you

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.580
to come to as many lectures
as you possibly can.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.630
Now, the additional
requirement that you're

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.660
going to have for this course is
to write two research reports,

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.770
one for vision and
one for audition.

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:52.800
And the assigned written report
that you need to put together

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.830
is in a paper at the
bottom of the second page.

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.820
In this case, it's
going to be a paper that

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.550
was written quite
some years ago,

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.390
a very important and remarkable
paper that has been published

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.120
by Oster and Barlow,
as you can see.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.310
And the task for you will
be to not just report

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.089
what they had reported,
because that's repetitious,

00:04:17.089 --> 00:04:22.300
but to do a bit of
research and write

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.430
about what has been discovered
since the remarkable findings

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.475
that these two people
had made at the time.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.000
All right.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.140
So that's the research report.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.960
And then I want to
specify the exams.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.870
We are going to
have a midterm exam,

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:46.880
and the exact date for this has
already been set on October 23.

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:49.540
All right?

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.390
But as I say, you
can find this, and I

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.985
will specify that in more
detail in just a minute.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.792
And then we are going
to have a final exam

00:04:58.792 --> 00:04:59.750
at the end of the term.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.800
The exact date for
this, as always at MIT,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:08.420
will not have been set until
probably sometime in November.

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:12.670
So now let me also specify
the grade breakdown.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.370
I think that's
important for all of us.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:20.110
The written report for
each half of the course--

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.260
there's going to be one
report, as I've already said,

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.780
for vision and
one for audition--

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:32.790
and that will constitute
10% of the grade for each.

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:35.890
And the midterm exam,
this constitutes 25%.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.760
The final exam constitutes
55% of the overall grade.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:51.410
And in that, 15% will be on
vision and 40% on audition.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.870
So if you add that up, you can
see that vision and audition

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.885
are set up to be exactly
equally weighed for the exams.

00:06:00.157 --> 00:06:00.698
MICHELLE: Hi.

00:06:00.698 --> 00:06:01.670
I'm Michelle.

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.586
I'll be helping the professors,
especially with [INAUDIBLE].

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.580
PROFESSOR: So I'm Chris Brown,
and I'm one of the instructors.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:13.900
I'll be teaching
the second half.

00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:19.600
And my research is on two areas,
brain stem auditory reflexes,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.745
like the startle reflex and
the middle ear muscle reflex.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:27.760
And I also work on animal models
of the auditory brain stem

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.450
implant, which is a
neural prosthesis that's

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:32.005
used in deaf individuals.

00:06:33.735 --> 00:06:34.610
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.250
And I'm Peter Schiller, and
I work on the visual system.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.040
And I'm a professor
here in our department.

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.340
So that's very nice.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.240
Thank you for the introductions.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.520
And I hope, you guys, we
all get to know each other.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.470
I'm very impressed that
there's so many seniors here.

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.360
That's actually unusual.

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.400
I don't remember having
this high a percentage

00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.860
of seniors in the class.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.200
That's really very
nice, very nice.

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:01.840
OK.

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.840
So now we are going to
talk, for the first part

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:15.040
of today's lecture, about what
aspects of visual processing

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.900
we are trying to
understand and, therefore,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.650
what we are going
to try to cover

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:22.800
in this course in
terms of topics.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.300
OK?

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.030
So first of all,
what we are going

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:31.990
to do for several lectures
is to talk about the layout

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:35.620
and organization of the
visual system itself.

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:42.520
Most of it we will discuss as
it applies to higher mammals,

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.280
in particular monkeys
and primates and humans.

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:53.580
Then we are going to talk
about specific aspects

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.390
of visual processing.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:08:00.220
We're going to try to understand
how we adapt in vision,

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:03.370
and, very interestingly,
how we are

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.995
able to perceive colors and
process them accurately.

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:11.180
Another fascinating
topic is how we

00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:15.350
are capable of analyzing motion.

00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.740
That's a complex, very
interesting topic,

00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:19.820
as is depth perception.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.220
And the reason depth
perception is particularly

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:25.120
interesting is
because, as you know,

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.560
the retinal surface
is essentially

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.975
a two-dimensional arrangement.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.169
And yet from whatever falls
on these two dimensions

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:36.010
in the left and right
eyes, somehow the brain

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:40.270
needs to convert to be able
to see the third dimension.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:42.330
And as a result,
several mechanisms

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:45.220
have evolved to
accomplish that, and we

00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:47.620
are going to discuss them.

00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:49.930
Then, again, another
very complex topic

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:52.400
is how we can recognize objects.

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.070
Perhaps the most
complex of those

00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:57.125
is our incredible ability
to recognize faces.

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:00.560
And that is
highlighted, of course,

00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:03.910
by the fact that if you look
at more simple organisms,

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:07.250
like, I don't know, monkeys,
they all look the same to you.

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.710
But human beings,
who are actually

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:11.930
more similar to each other
than perhaps monkeys are,

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:13.750
we are really capable
of telling them

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:19.460
apart and readily recognize
them over long periods of time.

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.855
So it's a very
interesting topic.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:25.000
And yet another topic
that we will discuss

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.220
is how we make eye movements.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.230
As you probably know,
or you're aware of,

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.450
that we are constantly
moving your eye.

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:35.560
You make saccadic eye movements
about three times a second,

00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:39.290
thousands of times a day,
hundreds of thousands of times,

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.980
to be able to see things
clearly in the world.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:44.730
So we are going to
try to understand

00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:48.490
how that incredible
ability has evolved

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:55.291
and how it is
realized by the brain.

00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:55.790
OK.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:59.390
So now to look at exactly how
we are going to cover this,

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:00.840
let me go through this.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:05.790
During the next lecture,
which is September 9,

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:09.310
we are going to look at the
basic layout of the retina

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:12.150
and the lateral
geniculate system,

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:17.040
as well as how the visual
system in general is wired.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.396
Then on September
11, we're going

00:10:19.396 --> 00:10:21.760
to look at the
visual cortex, then

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.880
at the ON and OFF
channels, so-called,

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.040
that you'll realize what they
are once we talk about it.

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.890
And then there's
another set of channels

00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:30.390
that originates in
the retina, which

00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.690
are the midget and
parasol channels.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:36.850
We'll discuss those, try to
figure out why did they evolve

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.000
and what is their role
in being able to see

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.400
the world in realistic fashion.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:46.520
Then we're going to talk about
adaption and color, depth

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.920
perception, form perception.

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.670
And then we're going to have
a lot of fun on October 2,

00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:54.760
and we're going to look
at illusions and also

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.846
visual prosthesis,
because one of you,

00:10:56.846 --> 00:10:59.250
in particular, is
interested in that topic.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.260
Then we are going to talk about
the neural control of visually

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.135
guided eye movements.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.300
That's going to consist
of two sessions.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.770
And then we're going to
talk about motion perception

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:14.050
and another aspect
of eye movements

00:11:14.050 --> 00:11:17.610
when we pursue something
with smooth eye movements.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.780
And then we're going
to have an overview.

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:22.230
And then, lastly,
on October 23rd,

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:24.410
we are going to have
the midterm exam.

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:28.680
That's going to cover questions
from all of these lectures.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.760
I should tell you right now
that the midterm exam is going

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.080
to consist of
multiple-choice questions.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.605
So you're not going to, maybe,
asked to write anything.

00:11:38.605 --> 00:11:39.980
You're going to
have to just pick

00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:43.370
from each of the questions
the correct answer.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:45.080
All right.

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.020
So now what I would like to talk
about next in a summary fashion

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:53.320
are what we call the
tools of the trade.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.990
What has happened
over the many years

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.740
that scientists
tried to understand

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.400
how the visual system and, for
that matter the brain, works,

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.800
what kinds of methods
have been employed.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.560
And so I'm going to talk about
each of these just very briefly

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:13.770
this time, and then they
will come up repeatedly

00:12:13.770 --> 00:12:15.320
during all of the lectures.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.453
Now, the first method
I'm going to talk about

00:12:19.453 --> 00:12:20.453
is called psychophysics.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:23.435
I'm sure most of you
know what that is.

00:12:23.435 --> 00:12:30.530
It's a scientific way to study
behavior of humans and animals

00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:33.437
to determine how
well they can see.

00:12:33.437 --> 00:12:35.270
Now, there are several
procedures with this.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.950
I'm going to describe
one that's used

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:39.760
both in humans and monkeys.

00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:44.620
And what you can do nowadays,
you can use a color monitor,

00:12:44.620 --> 00:12:47.540
and I will describe
that in just a second.

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.920
After that, I will
talk about anatomy.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.320
I will talk about
electrophysiology,

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:56.500
pharmacology, brain lesions,
imaging, and optogenetics.

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:01.220
So now let's start with
psychophysics in more detail.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:06.060
So here is a color monitor,
and either monkeys or humans

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:11.010
can be trained to first
look at a fixation spot.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:14.420
And that's important
because we want to always

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.150
be able to present
stimuli in selected

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:19.300
locations of the visual
field or selected

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.700
locations along the retina.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:23.920
This is particularly
important, because when

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:29.950
you study the brain, different
regions of the visual field

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.100
representation are located
in different areas,

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.880
for example, in
the visual cortex.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.920
So what you do then is you
can present a single stimulus

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.070
like this, and the task
of the human or the monkey

00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:45.600
is to either make a
saccadic eye movement to it,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.740
say that's where
it is, or to press

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:49.530
a lever that's in front of them.

00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:54.890
And then on each trial,
it appears someplace else.

00:13:54.890 --> 00:13:57.830
You can present it in
many different locations,

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.590
and maybe one of
those locations will

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:03.450
be relevant to what part of
the brain you are studying.

00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.040
And then what you do,
you can systematically

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.130
vary all kinds of
aspects of the stimulus.

00:14:09.130 --> 00:14:10.590
You can vary the color.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:12.450
You can vary the contrast.

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.160
You can vary the size.

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.160
You can vary the shape.

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:18.460
And by systematically
varying this,

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:24.730
you can create curves to
describe exactly how well you

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:27.410
can see any
particular thing like,

00:14:27.410 --> 00:14:30.830
for example, just
how much contrast you

00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.150
need to perceive something.

00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:33.840
All right.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:37.170
So that's called
the detection task.

00:14:37.170 --> 00:14:40.310
Now, a related task, which has
also been used extensively,

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:42.540
is called the
discrimination task.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.090
In this case, you present
a fixation spot again.

00:14:46.090 --> 00:14:48.250
The person or the
monkey fixates,

00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:51.140
and then you present a whole
bunch of stimuli, one of which

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.020
is different from the others.

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:56.260
And you have to select
where that one had appeared,

00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.920
the one that's different,
by making an eye movement

00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:01.120
or pressing the
appropriate lever.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.900
Now, when you do this,
you systematically

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:09.040
can vary the difference between
the so-called distractor

00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.880
stimuli, which
are all identical,

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.420
and the target
until the person is

00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.470
no longer able to
tell the difference.

00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:17.520
And that way you can,
again, generate a curve.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.500
And you can specify just what
is the amount of difference

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.500
that you need to
put in this, say,

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:29.400
how good are you at perceiving
slightly different colors.

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.880
All right?

00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.110
And by doing that
systematically,

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:36.430
you can generate
these functions using

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:38.960
these psychophysical
procedures to determine

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.800
pretty well how
you're able to see.

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:46.560
And now this particular
approach is also very useful

00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.750
when it comes to studying
individuals, humans

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:53.690
in this case, who have
some problems with vision.

00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.810
So if they have a
problem in seeing colors,

00:15:57.810 --> 00:16:02.300
you can readily
determine, well, what's

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:03.640
the magnitude of that problem?

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:09.900
And thereby it can tell
you what procedures

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.210
might be used to try to
ameliorate their shortcoming.

00:16:15.210 --> 00:16:19.380
Now, another method that
has been used extensively

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.640
in not only vision, but in
many, many different areas

00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:26.500
of studying the brain, including
audition of course, is anatomy.

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:34.610
Numerous methods have evolved
in the course of anatomists

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:38.990
working on these problems, and
the first is a very simple one.

00:16:38.990 --> 00:16:41.190
You just look at
the whole brain.

00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:43.870
And I'm showing this because
this is a monkey brain,

00:16:43.870 --> 00:16:47.250
and you will encounter the
monkey brain repeatedly.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:50.730
And it so happens
that after people

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.520
have studied this
extensively, they

00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.610
were able to give
names to just about

00:16:55.610 --> 00:17:00.870
every gyrus or every brain
area and also relate it

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.400
to what the function
is of those areas.

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.190
And so, for example, just
to name a few of these,

00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:08.349
this is called the
central sulcus.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:12.420
I need to do one
more thing here.

00:17:19.491 --> 00:17:19.990
OK.

00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:22.680
So this here is
the central sulcus.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.280
All right?

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.690
Just for you to
remember, humans also

00:17:25.690 --> 00:17:27.710
have a central
sulcus, of course.

00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:30.230
And this is the lunate sulcus.

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:33.720
And this region back here--
let's see, did I label this?

00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.685
Oh, here's a couple more, the
arcuate and the principalis.

00:17:37.685 --> 00:17:39.960
You will encounter
these repeatedly.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:43.850
And this region
back here is the one

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:50.100
which is the primary visual
cortex in monkeys that

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.250
has been extensively
studied and has

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:57.990
yielded remarkable discoveries
about the way it works.

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:03.470
So that is called area V1,
or primary visual cortex.

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.970
All right.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:06.600
So now just another
example, if I

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.820
can show you just a few
examples of anatomy.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:13.520
Here's another example showing
what the eye looks like.

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:16.310
And the remarkable thing
about the human eye,

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.280
and the eye of monkeys
as well and primates,

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.170
is it has become
highly specialized.

00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:25.890
There's a region here
which is called the fovea.

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:32.140
And in that region, you have a
very, very dense distribution

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:36.080
of photoreceptors and
other cells in the retina.

00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.470
And because of that, you
have very high acuity there.

00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:43.180
Now, because of that,
the eye movements

00:18:43.180 --> 00:18:48.630
have to become effective for you
to be able to see fine detail.

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.772
So even, for example,
when you read,

00:18:51.772 --> 00:18:52.980
what do you do when you read?

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:55.490
You make saccadic eye
movements across a line.

00:18:55.490 --> 00:18:58.840
Then you go down the next line
three or four saccadic eye

00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.425
movements, and so
on down the page.

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:05.690
And you do that because you
cannot make out the details

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.100
of letters in the
periphery because, there,

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.810
the distribution of the
photoreceptors and the cells

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:17.195
in the retina in general
become less and less dense.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.200
So that is a high
degree of specialization

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:24.560
that we will discuss in
much more detail next time.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:27.980
Now then, all the fibers
from the retinal ganglion

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.940
cells course across the
inner surface of the retina

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.820
and go to the so-called
optic nerve through which

00:19:36.820 --> 00:19:40.370
over a million fibers
from the retina project

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:44.070
into the nervous system.

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:47.700
And how they project
exactly, what that's

00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:50.940
like I will discuss
in considerable detail

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.170
the next time.

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.600
Now, this area here
is often also called

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.330
the blind spot,
and that you don't

00:19:59.330 --> 00:20:01.460
see even if you close one eye.

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:05.100
But if you do a
careful experiment--

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.150
I'll explain that the next
time-- you can actually map out

00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:10.845
this little region where
you don't see anything.

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:14.710
They're in different
locations in the two eyes,

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:19.640
so the two blind
spots do not overlap.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.900
And so, consequently, when
you look with both eyes,

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.590
you don't have a,
quote, blind spot.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:29.230
So that's an example of what
the human retina looks like,

00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:31.460
and this has been
studied extensively

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:35.150
using a whole array of
anatomical procedures.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:39.610
Now, the third anatomical
procedure I want to tell you

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:42.910
is labeling individual cells.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:46.640
Now, the way this was done,
or still is being done,

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.500
is that you slice the brain
into very, very thin sections.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.380
And you put them on
a glass, and then you

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:56.440
can look at them
under a microscope.

00:20:56.440 --> 00:21:00.900
Now, here's an example of
a cross-coronal section

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:03.430
of the monkey lateral
geniculate nucleus.

00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:06.170
That's one region in the brain
to which the retinal ganglion

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.770
cells project.

00:21:07.770 --> 00:21:09.880
And it's a beautifully
layered structure,

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.380
which I'll describe in
detail the next time.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:16.220
And these little spots
that you see here

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:24.110
are actual cells, which are
labeled using a so-called Nissl

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.610
stain.

00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:30.780
Now, another method
used in staining cells

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:35.170
is the famous Golgi stain,
which was discovered, invented,

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:38.370
perhaps, you could say, by
Golgi, for which he received

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:41.010
the Nobel Prize in 1906.

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:45.960
The remarkable quality
of those productions

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:51.910
is that this label-- it's a
silver label-- stains not only

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:55.260
the cell bodies, as the Nissl
stain you have just seen,

00:21:55.260 --> 00:22:00.520
but also all the processes, the
dendrites as well as the axons.

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.430
So you see a whole
cell as a result

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.590
of that staining procedure.

00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:08.370
Yet another way
to do this, which

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:11.240
is more sophisticated
nowadays, is

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:18.485
to record intracellularly from
a cell and then inject a label.

00:22:19.890 --> 00:22:23.605
This happens to be the so-called
Procion Yellow labeling

00:22:23.605 --> 00:22:24.105
substance.

00:22:24.105 --> 00:22:27.340
You inject in the eye, and then
you process the tissue again

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:28.500
in thin layers.

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:31.330
And this is an example
of what that looks like.

00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:35.260
So this also stains all
the processes of the cell.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.290
And the advantage
here is that you

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:40.310
can study this cell
electrophysiologically

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:42.520
and determine what
it is like, and then

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.050
stain it so you can establish
the relationship what

00:22:45.050 --> 00:22:48.451
the cell does and what
the cell looks like.

00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:48.950
All right.

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:53.270
So now let's turn to the
electrophysiological method,

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:58.320
which is a consequence of this,
logical consequence of it.

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.900
Once again, here we
have a monkey brain.

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:07.170
And what you do here, we put
microelectrodes into the brain.

00:23:07.170 --> 00:23:09.310
Now, this was a
discovery that was

00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:12.470
made around the turn of the
century, little bit after.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.160
Initially,
microelectrodes were made

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:21.260
from very thin tubes of
glass, which were heated

00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:25.485
and then pulled so that the tip
became smaller than a micron.

00:23:26.730 --> 00:23:28.200
So it was very, very small.

00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.205
Subsequently, other
methods were developed.

00:23:31.715 --> 00:23:36.870
They etched fine pieces a wire
until the tip was very, very

00:23:36.870 --> 00:23:39.170
small, and then they corded it.

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:43.880
And they then we were able
to put these electrodes

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:48.440
into the brain and record single
cells just like with glass

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.600
pipettes.

00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:54.420
So the example here then is
that you take a microelectrode,

00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.700
put it into the brain,
and then that is connected

00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:03.430
to an amplifier
system and a computer.

00:24:03.430 --> 00:24:07.980
And when you do that, you can
record from a single cell.

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:10.500
Now, as you well
know, single cells

00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.755
generate action potentials.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:17.850
And that is shown here
on an oscilloscope

00:24:17.850 --> 00:24:19.800
in a schematic fashion.

00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.930
And what some
clever people did is

00:24:22.930 --> 00:24:29.720
that they decided that an easy
way to process information

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:35.420
about the manner
single cells generated

00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.990
action potentials is to put
this signal onto a loudspeaker

00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:41.080
system.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:44.020
And so every time a cell fired,
what you would literally hear

00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.700
is beep, beep, like that.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:46.400
OK?

00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.720
And so if you shown a
light on it several times,

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:52.770
it will go like
brrrp, like that.

00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:55.300
And the big
advantage of this was

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.284
that many cells see only a
tiny portion of the world.

00:24:58.284 --> 00:24:59.700
And if you don't
know where it is,

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.980
you have to take some
projector or something

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.190
and move it around.

00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:05.875
And if the receptive
field is here,

00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:10.040
you go, brrrp, brrrp,
brrrp, brrrp, like that.

00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:10.550
OK?

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:13.090
And so then you can map
it out very accurately.

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:16.370
Instead of having to like with
the oscilloscope, you hear it,

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:21.180
and that enables you to do all
kinds of things, experiments,

00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:23.435
and you don't have to
look at the oscilloscope.

00:25:23.435 --> 00:25:25.310
But you can perform all
sorts of experiments,

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:29.240
and you can hear the
responses of the cell.

00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.250
Now, another method
that is used extensively

00:25:32.250 --> 00:25:37.570
in electrophysiology is
called electrical stimulation.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:38.800
It's a similar process.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:41.540
You take a microelectrode,
for example, you

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:48.610
put it in the brain, and then
you pass electric current.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:52.120
Typically, that electric current
is passed in such a way as

00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.360
to mimic action potentials.

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:58.380
So if you are to listen to when
it's activated, again, brrrp,

00:25:58.380 --> 00:25:59.780
you hear that.

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:02.110
But this time, instead
of the cell firing,

00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:06.740
you are firing the area
there, and that then

00:26:06.740 --> 00:26:11.170
can elicit a response, all
right, all kinds of responses.

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:15.040
If you stimulate here, for
example-- remember now,

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.380
this is the visual
system in the monkey-- as

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:22.480
has been shown in humans,
electrical stimulation elicits

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.390
a percept, a small
spot, a star-like image.

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.730
In the auditory system
when you stimulate,

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:29.835
you can hear something.

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:38.020
And if you stimulate
in the areas that

00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.690
are related to moving your
eyes, then the simulation

00:26:42.690 --> 00:26:44.870
causes a saccadic eye movement.

00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:47.790
So all those methods
are very, very good

00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:54.950
in trying to understand better
the organization of the brain

00:26:54.950 --> 00:27:00.940
for, in this case for vision,
and for eye movements.

00:27:02.030 --> 00:27:04.320
Now, yet another
method that is used--

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.740
several methods I should
say-- is pharmacology.

00:27:07.740 --> 00:27:12.230
And when you do
pharmacological experiments,

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:14.830
one procedure is-- and
many different procedures,

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:17.640
I'll just describe
one here-- once again,

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:23.000
you can stick a glass
pipette into the brain,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.960
and then you can inject it.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.200
You can inject it either
with actually a syringe

00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.510
or using several
other methods, and you

00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:32.600
can inject all kinds of agents.

00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.840
For example, you can inject
a neurotransmitter analog

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:42.270
or a neurotransmitter antagonist
to determine what effects it

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:46.130
has in various parts of
the brain and, in our case,

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:50.270
in the visual system or
the ocular motor system.

00:27:50.270 --> 00:27:54.140
Now, yet another method
that has been used

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.855
is brain inactivation.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:03.285
Several procedures are available
to inactivate the brain.

00:28:05.410 --> 00:28:06.940
Once again, here's
a monkey brain.

00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:10.170
And this region
here that I already

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:12.950
told you a little
bit about because

00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:19.870
of naming the gyri there, OK, is
called the frontal eye fields.

00:28:19.870 --> 00:28:23.910
This region has something
to do with moving your eyes.

00:28:23.910 --> 00:28:27.390
So what you can do if you
want to study and find out

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:30.240
just what does this
area do, one procedure

00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:34.265
is to-- again, here is
V1-- is to make a lesion.

00:28:35.971 --> 00:28:38.880
Now, sometimes you actually
do that in a monkey.

00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.570
But sometimes in
some experiments,

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:49.160
humans may have an
accident, some event when

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.700
you served in
Vietnam or something,

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:55.230
and a region of
the brain has been

00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:57.860
removed by virtue of
a bullet or something.

00:28:57.860 --> 00:29:00.700
And that way you
can find out what

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:04.830
is the consequence of
having a lesion like that.

00:29:04.830 --> 00:29:07.120
You can study, use a
psychophysical procedure,

00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.570
as I described to
you, to determine just

00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:15.050
what is the consequence
of having lost this area.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:17.750
This is a huge
region of research.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:20.930
A great many types of
experiments have been done.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:24.180
One of the famous individuals
who had done this kind of work

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:27.830
is Hans-Lukas Teuber,
who used to be

00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:31.430
the chairman of our department
starting way, way, way

00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:33.790
back in 1962.

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:40.320
And his specialty was to study
Second World War veterans who

00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.370
had sustained various
kinds of brain injuries.

00:29:43.370 --> 00:29:45.480
And the basis of
that, studying them

00:29:45.480 --> 00:29:52.280
using psychophysical
procedures, to assess what

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:57.990
various areas in the brain, what
kind of functions they have,

00:29:57.990 --> 00:30:00.950
what kinds of tasks
do they perform.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:05.550
Now, yet another method, which
has some major advantages,

00:30:05.550 --> 00:30:08.940
is to make reversible
inactivations rather than

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.890
permanent ones.

00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:14.640
And this you can
do by, for example,

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.590
using a method of cooling.

00:30:16.590 --> 00:30:19.810
There's a device, the
so-called Peltier device,

00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:22.430
that you can put on
top of the brain.

00:30:22.430 --> 00:30:26.410
And then electronically, you
can cool the surface that

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:28.880
is in touch with
the brain, and then

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.050
you can see what happens
when you cool it.

00:30:31.050 --> 00:30:33.920
And then when you
warm it up again,

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.000
you can see what happens to
recovery, which, in this case,

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.740
in almost all cases
like this, leads

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.645
to full recovery and
the same performance

00:30:43.645 --> 00:30:46.540
as prior to starting
the cooling.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:47.040
Yes?

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:50.310
AUDIENCE: Can you only use this
method for surface structures

00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:50.810
or?

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:51.780
PROFESSOR: No.

00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:54.590
They have now developed
methods where you can actually

00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:57.190
lower them into the brain.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:31:02.250
And they're usually much
finer, and very often they're

00:31:02.250 --> 00:31:05.060
sort of a loop type device.

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.560
And you can lower that into
the gyri or wherever you like,

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.661
and, again, do the
reversible cooling.

00:31:10.661 --> 00:31:11.160
Yes.

00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:15.230
That's a fairly recently
developed device,

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:17.115
and it works extremely well.

00:31:17.115 --> 00:31:21.370
Now, yet another approach
is to inject substances

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:25.200
into the brain that
anesthetize, if you will,

00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:29.000
a particular region
after the injection,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.450
but only for a limited time.

00:31:31.450 --> 00:31:36.790
And then you can see how
the behavior is affected.

00:31:37.820 --> 00:31:39.490
Now, a variant of
that that I referred

00:31:39.490 --> 00:31:44.040
to before, of course, is
that you can use agents that

00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:48.790
are selective, that don't
inactivate the whole area,

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:57.360
but for example, only affect
excitatory neurotransmitters

00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:59.570
or only affect inhibitory ones.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:01.790
So you can do kinds
of selective things.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.490
And so you can
establish the role

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:09.120
of various neurotransmitters
in the role

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:12.990
they play in
various brain areas.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:17.270
Now, yet another method
very recently developed,

00:32:17.270 --> 00:32:20.025
which has been incredibly
successful, is imaging.

00:32:21.320 --> 00:32:23.230
As you probably
all know, you all

00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:28.550
know we do have an
MRI facility here

00:32:28.550 --> 00:32:31.270
in our department on the
ground floor, and some of you

00:32:31.270 --> 00:32:33.850
may even have been
subjects in it.

00:32:33.850 --> 00:32:37.100
What that does is
when you put a subject

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.480
into this-- the variant
of that is called

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:43.470
fMRI, functional Magnetic
Resonance Imaging.

00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:45.980
And so if you put a person
in the magnet and you present

00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:50.700
a certain set of
stimuli repeatedly, OK,

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:55.340
or differential ones,
whatever, the brain areas

00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:58.710
that are active
performing the analysis

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:03.050
that you ask them
to do light up.

00:33:04.330 --> 00:33:08.620
So that method-- here's a
complex picture of that.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.030
This is one that is
in Freiberg, Germany.

00:33:12.370 --> 00:33:14.510
This is done with monkeys again.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:16.830
You have this device and
you put the monkey in there.

00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:19.820
You lower the device
on it, and then you

00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:24.890
can have the subject
perform trained tasks.

00:33:24.890 --> 00:33:26.820
And then you can
analyze the brain

00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:29.120
and look at the
nature of activation.

00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:31.530
And here's an example
of that, whatever

00:33:31.530 --> 00:33:33.310
this task is, doesn't matter.

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:34.890
You can see that
a particular brain

00:33:34.890 --> 00:33:37.580
region has been very
heavily activated

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.780
as a result of whatever
manipulation they did.

00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.780
Now, there are lots and
lots and lots of experiments

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:46.960
of this sort, and we will
talk about several of those

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:50.960
as we look at various
aspects of the visual system.

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:54.870
Now, the last method I want to
just mention very, very briefly

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:56.310
is optogenetics.

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:59.040
That's a new method, and we
have actually several people

00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.510
in our department here
who are using this method.

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.460
Now, this particular
method-- let

00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:09.285
me explain just very quickly
what this is all about.

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.870
Does everybody know
what an opsin is?

00:34:15.030 --> 00:34:15.530
OK.

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:16.738
How about if I say rhodopsin?

00:34:17.989 --> 00:34:18.610
OK.

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:19.795
Most of you will know that.

00:34:19.795 --> 00:34:23.770
A rhodopsin is a
set of molecules

00:34:23.770 --> 00:34:27.780
that are in the rods
in the photoreceptors,

00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:29.579
and they are sensitive to light.

00:34:29.579 --> 00:34:31.120
Now, there are all
kinds of variants.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:33.774
That's why I mentioned opsins
rather than rhodopsins.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:39.960
And what can be done is
that you can selectivity

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:44.989
place these various substances
into selected types of cells

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:46.489
in the brain.

00:34:46.489 --> 00:34:52.370
And then, because these cells
become light sensitive just

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:58.670
like the photoreceptors are,
then when you shine light

00:34:58.670 --> 00:35:09.150
onto the area where you had
placed these opsins in cells,

00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:10.360
you can drive them.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:14.120
You can make them respond
by turning the light on.

00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:16.130
Now, the amazing
thing about that

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:18.600
is that makes it a
more powerful technique

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.010
than electrical stimulation,
that you can set this up

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:33.040
in such a way that, for
example, if you use a rhodopsin

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:39.010
substance that is
sensitive to red light,

00:35:39.010 --> 00:35:43.560
it will be excited
by the red light.

00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:49.810
But if you have a slightly
different substance that

00:35:49.810 --> 00:35:52.220
would be inhibited
by blue light,

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:55.020
then you can see what happens
if you excite those cells,

00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:56.910
and then you
inhibit those cells.

00:35:56.910 --> 00:36:00.210
So this gives you two
sides to the coin,

00:36:00.210 --> 00:36:03.340
whereas electrical stimulation
provides only one side.

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:04.970
So that's a wonderful technique.

00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:08.200
And here's sort of a
good example of that.

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.650
Here we have
injected-- I shouldn't

00:36:11.650 --> 00:36:15.980
say injected-- but
genetically labeled

00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.490
cells with
channelrhodopsin, so-called.

00:36:20.490 --> 00:36:24.700
And when that's done, when
you shine in a blue light,

00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:27.340
OK, you excite the cell.

00:36:27.340 --> 00:36:33.120
And then instead, if you put
in so-called halorhodopsin, OK,

00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:36.130
halorhodopsin, then if
you use yellow light

00:36:36.130 --> 00:36:37.970
you inhibit the cells.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:39.560
So that's a
remarkable technique.

00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.520
It's just at the very
beginning of things,

00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.430
so we won't talk too
much about this technique

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:48.400
in studying the
visual system yet.

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.930
But I bet you that
in another 10 years

00:36:50.930 --> 00:36:52.870
this is going to
be a central topic.

00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:53.370
All right.

00:36:53.370 --> 00:36:55.520
So to summarize
these techniques,

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.730
other than the psychophysics,
just remind you again,

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:02.444
number one, we have
electrical recording

00:37:02.444 --> 00:37:03.360
using microelectrodes.

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:05.940
OK?

00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.325
Then secondly, we have
electrical stimulation.

00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:14.110
Thirdly, we have injection
of pharmacological agent.

00:37:14.110 --> 00:37:18.140
Then we have methods
to inactivate regions,

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:21.420
either permanently by lesions
or reversibly by cooling

00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.320
or by injecting
various substances.

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:27.030
And lastly, we have
optogenetics that

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:31.200
enables you to activate
cells or inhibit cells

00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:34.760
by shining light onto the brain.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.480
So these are quite a
remarkable set of techniques.

00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:44.060
And individuals who want
to become neuroscientists,

00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.960
they're going to have to
learn to master not maybe

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.390
all of these techniques,
but certainly some of them

00:37:49.390 --> 00:37:52.880
so that they can carry out
new and original experiments

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.990
in determining how
the brain works

00:37:55.990 --> 00:37:59.070
and, in our case, of course,
how the visual system works.

00:37:59.070 --> 00:38:02.390
So that is, in essence then,
what I wanted to cover.

00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:08.040
And now we are going to move
on and have Chris tell you

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:16.980
about his portion
of the course, which

00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:22.095
will be taught during the
second half of this semester.

00:38:22.095 --> 00:38:24.840
So as I said, next
time we are going

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.250
to start talking
about, first of all,

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:31.960
about the wiring of the visual
system, the basic wiring.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:35.040
And then we're going to talk
about the retina in detail

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.950
and a little bit about the
lateral geniculate nucleus.

00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:39.030
That's the next lecture.

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.876
Please.

00:38:39.876 --> 00:38:43.278
AUDIENCE: So for the eigtht
readings, the eight assigned

00:38:43.278 --> 00:38:45.870
readings that you
have on here, how

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:48.138
will we know when to read what?

00:38:50.090 --> 00:38:51.945
PROFESSOR: Well,
that's a good question.

00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.870
The sections that have
to do with eye movements

00:38:58.870 --> 00:39:03.250
that you can see, that you
don't have to read until we

00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:06.792
get to the eye movements,
the latter part.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:13.520
Initially, when we talk about
the retina, for example,

00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:21.290
you definitely want to
read the [INAUDIBLE] paper

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:25.325
and the Schiller paper on
parallel information processing

00:39:25.325 --> 00:39:25.825
channels.

00:39:32.660 --> 00:39:35.243
Then the ones that have to
do with the Hermann grid

00:39:35.243 --> 00:39:37.664
illusion and visual
prosthesis, that you

00:39:37.664 --> 00:39:39.080
don't have to cover
until you come

00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.160
to the section on illusions
and visual prosthesis.

00:39:43.697 --> 00:39:44.280
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.270
Welcome, everybody.

00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:47.520
I'm Chris Brown.

00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:51.060
And I just, in the
remaining time,

00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.730
wanted to give you
a synopsis of what's

00:39:53.730 --> 00:39:56.170
going to happen during the
second half of the term.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.190
So I'll be giving the lectures
during the second half

00:40:00.190 --> 00:40:02.180
on the topic of
audition, or hearing.

00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:05.670
And there's my email,
chris_brown@meei.harvard.edu.

00:40:10.330 --> 00:40:13.370
So as you can see
by my email, I'm

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:16.990
associated with Harvard, in
fact, Harvard Medical School.

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:23.450
And I'm in the so-called ENT
department at Harvard Med

00:40:23.450 --> 00:40:27.060
School, and that stands
for Ear, Nose, and Throat.

00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:30.840
So some of you who are going
to be going to medical school

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.450
will certainly do
an ENT rotation,

00:40:33.450 --> 00:40:36.600
where you learn about the
various aspects of ENT.

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:39.290
And much of it, of
course, is the subject

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:43.020
of otology, what happens
when people have disorders

00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.820
of hearing, problems
with their hearing.

00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:48.930
And in addition,
many ENT doctors

00:40:48.930 --> 00:40:51.650
also operate on people who
have head and neck cancers.

00:40:52.730 --> 00:40:55.160
So surgeries of
those two types go

00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.610
on at my hospital, which is
Massachusetts Eye and Ear

00:40:58.610 --> 00:40:59.110
Infirmary.

00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.120
And that's across
the river in Boston,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:08.860
and it is, of course, one of the
main teaching hospitals for ENT

00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.720
as well as ophthalmology.

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.260
There's a big
Ophthalmology department

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:15.460
where the ophthalmologists
deal with disorders

00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.350
of sight and vision.

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:25.580
So I have an
introductory reading,

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:29.380
which is a book chapter
that I wrote, and also

00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:33.580
with Joe Santos-Sacchi,
which is actually

00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.880
now in the fourth
edition of a textbook

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.690
called Fundamental Neuroscience.

00:41:37.690 --> 00:41:41.700
And I believe this book chapter
is on the course website now.

00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.690
And it summarizes
pretty much what

00:41:44.690 --> 00:41:48.020
I'll cover during the
semester in a reading

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.005
that you could probably
do in an hour or less,

00:41:50.005 --> 00:41:52.290
and it has many of the
figures that I'll use.

00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:55.030
So if you're shopping
around for a course

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:57.760
and want to know what's going to
happen in the second half here,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.540
you can look at
that book chapter.

00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:03.610
There's a nice
textbook that I'll also

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:05.700
be assigning a
number of readings

00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:07.880
from throughout
the term, and it's

00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:13.040
called Auditory Neuroscience,
Making Sense of Sound

00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:16.910
by Schnupp, Nelken, and King.

00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:22.490
And these fellows are, in the
case of the first and the last,

00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:27.400
at Oxford University, and they
work on psychophysics, that is,

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:29.360
how we perceive hearing.

00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:31.140
And they test
humans, and they also

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.000
do a fair amount of
animals psychophysics.

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.150
And in the case
of Israel Nelken,

00:42:37.150 --> 00:42:40.360
he's at Hebrew
University in Israel.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:43.040
And he does a lot of
electrophysiological

00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.300
recordings-- you heard
about electrophysiology

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:48.470
from Peter's talk just
now-- and recordings

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:50.830
especially from the
auditory cortex.

00:42:50.830 --> 00:42:55.310
But this is a very nice
book for coverage especially

00:42:55.310 --> 00:42:58.780
of the central auditory
pathway in psychophysics.

00:42:58.780 --> 00:42:59.980
And it's pretty cheap.

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:01.520
I think it's $30.

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.640
And I believe I was told
earlier that you can get it,

00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:08.250
as an MIT student, online free.

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:10.310
And what's good about
the online edition

00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:12.950
is there are lots
of demonstrations,

00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:16.370
each indicated by the little
icon in the margin of the text.

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:18.250
And when you click on
that demonstration,

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:19.820
if you have your
earbuds in you can

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.820
hear what the sound
demonstration is.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.427
And I'll be doing quite a
lot of sound demonstrations

00:43:25.427 --> 00:43:27.510
through the course of the
semester because I think

00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:29.290
it livens up the
class a little bit,

00:43:29.290 --> 00:43:32.410
and this book is especially
good for sound demos.

00:43:34.184 --> 00:43:35.600
So I encourage you
at least to get

00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:38.150
the online edition
of that textbook.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.620
So also on the course
website is the syllabus

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:46.990
for what the audition
lectures will cover,

00:43:46.990 --> 00:43:50.210
and I just put a couple
here to give you a flavor.

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:54.170
In the first lecture
on October 28th,

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:58.070
we'll talk about the physical
characteristics of sound

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:00.110
and what happens
to that sound when

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.940
it strikes your
external, and then

00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.820
your middle, and inner ears.

00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:12.120
And associated with each lecture
is an original research article

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.420
that, in this case,
is Hofman, et al.,

00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.700
and the title is "Relearning
Sound Localization

00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:20.490
with New Ears."

00:44:20.490 --> 00:44:23.770
And so, in a nutshell, what
they did in that research report

00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:26.510
was they took little
pieces of clay,

00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:31.050
and they inserted them into
their external ears or pinna,

00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:35.070
and therefore distorted
quite a lot your pinnae.

00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.550
They couldn't do
what van Gogh did,

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:39.270
which was cut off the
pinna, but they certainly

00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:42.140
distorted their pinnaes
quite a lot on both sides.

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.430
And then they tested,
using themselves

00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:47.690
as subjects and
other volunteers,

00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:51.115
how good their ability
to localize sound was.

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:56.310
And especially in terms of when
the sound varied in elevation,

00:44:56.310 --> 00:44:58.500
they found that there
were huge differences,

00:44:58.500 --> 00:45:02.140
that they couldn't localize
sounds that were straight ahead

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:05.585
versus sounds that were
coming from above themselves

00:45:05.585 --> 00:45:06.543
with these distortions.

00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:10.470
But what was funny
and what harks back

00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:13.310
to the title of the
article is that when

00:45:13.310 --> 00:45:17.550
they had the volunteers go out
and live their normal lives

00:45:17.550 --> 00:45:21.600
with these pinna distortions
in for a few weeks,

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:25.520
then they came back into the
lab and tested them again,

00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:30.760
they found that they could now
localize sounds in elevation

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:32.560
with these new ears.

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.790
They relearned how
to localize sound.

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:38.570
So this is a nice demonstration
of learning or plasticity,

00:45:38.570 --> 00:45:40.560
at least in
psychophysical responses.

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.370
And it also emphasizes
the function

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:47.750
of your external ear, which
helps you localize sounds

00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:48.250
in space.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:54.390
In the second lecture, we'll
be talking about the receptor

00:45:54.390 --> 00:45:57.940
cells for hearing, which are
called hair cells because they

00:45:57.940 --> 00:45:59.930
have these little
appendages at their top

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:04.360
that looked to the early
neuroanatomists like hairs.

00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:07.970
And of course, sound
is a mechanical energy

00:46:07.970 --> 00:46:11.760
that moves the fluid in which
these hair cells are immersed

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:14.220
and moves these little
hairs or appendages

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.100
at the top of the
cell, and that's

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:19.650
how the cell can
respond then to sound.

00:46:19.650 --> 00:46:23.040
And so hair cells are the
very important receptor cells

00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:27.070
for hearing, which are, of
course, the analogs of the rods

00:46:27.070 --> 00:46:28.665
and cones in the visual system.

00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:32.300
And the research
report associated

00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.630
with our talk about
hair cells will

00:46:35.630 --> 00:46:40.500
be how a special protein
called prestin is required

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:44.330
for electromotility, which
is a function of outer hair

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:47.040
cells, one of the two
types of hair cells,

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:51.360
which allows them to actually
move and flux and change

00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.560
their membrane links
when they sense

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.950
these mechanical disturbances
by their stereocilia.

00:46:57.950 --> 00:47:01.025
So it's a pretty
interesting paper

00:47:01.025 --> 00:47:03.740
in what we call a
knockout animal.

00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.760
So the prestin is
genetically knocked out

00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:09.910
in this particular animal,
and the sense of hearing

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:12.650
is then tested again in
these knockout animals.

00:47:14.730 --> 00:47:16.930
So we have a whole
bunch of lectures.

00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:19.441
I haven't indicated all them.

00:47:19.441 --> 00:47:20.690
They're on the course website.

00:47:22.210 --> 00:47:25.900
Toward the end of the semester,
we'll have, as Peter indicated,

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.410
a written assignment
for audition.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:33.510
So I haven't actually
thought it up yet,

00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:35.940
but let me just
give you an example.

00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:40.160
Last year and this year,
we'll be talking a lot

00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:42.900
about neural prostheses
for audition.

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:46.140
And the most famous neural
prosthesis for audition,

00:47:46.140 --> 00:47:47.892
of course, is the
cochlear implant,

00:47:47.892 --> 00:47:49.600
which I'll talk a
little bit about later,

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.860
and it works quite well.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:54.430
There's also a neural
prosthesis that

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:56.790
goes into the
auditory brainstem.

00:47:56.790 --> 00:47:59.390
It's called the auditory
brainstem implant,

00:47:59.390 --> 00:48:01.640
and it's used in
some other types

00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.760
of individuals who are deaf.

00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:06.870
And it doesn't work anywhere
near as well as the cochlear

00:48:06.870 --> 00:48:07.710
implant.

00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:11.580
It's sometimes called a
lip reading assist device

00:48:11.580 --> 00:48:14.570
because people who have
the brainstem implant

00:48:14.570 --> 00:48:17.960
usually can't understand
speech over the telephone.

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.900
They need to be facing you
and looking at your lips

00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:22.370
as you're speaking.

00:48:22.370 --> 00:48:24.460
They need additional cues.

00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:26.965
And so there'll be
a lot of discussion

00:48:26.965 --> 00:48:29.840
this term about the
differences between these two

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:31.440
types of the implant,
where they're

00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:34.315
put in the auditory
pathway, and why

00:48:34.315 --> 00:48:37.110
one works much better
than the other.

00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:38.830
And that was the
written assignment

00:48:38.830 --> 00:48:43.800
for last year, which was a
discussion of why the cochlear

00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:46.725
implant works a lot better than
the auditory brainstem implant.

00:48:46.725 --> 00:48:50.260
So I'll have something
along those lines that

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.920
uses the material
from our course

00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.370
that you can take to
answer a question.

00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:00.830
OK.

00:49:00.830 --> 00:49:04.380
Let me just go through in
a half a dozen slides or so

00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:06.230
what I consider to
be the high points

00:49:06.230 --> 00:49:08.805
of the auditory
part of the course.

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:13.030
About the first third of the
auditory part of the course

00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:15.520
will be a discussion of
the auditory periphery.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.200
And the periphery
is usually divided

00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:24.230
into these three basic
divisions, the external ear,

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:28.360
which most of us think about as
the ear, the pinna and the ear

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:33.010
canal, which leads to
the tympanic membrane

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:34.545
here in yellow, or eardrum.

00:49:36.150 --> 00:49:39.740
And at that point
begins the middle ear.

00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:41.705
The middle ear is
an air-filled space.

00:49:42.915 --> 00:49:45.110
If you've been on a
recent plane flight

00:49:45.110 --> 00:49:47.630
and your ears are a
little bit stuffed up,

00:49:47.630 --> 00:49:50.020
it can be very uncomfortable,
especially when

00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.930
the plane is coming
down in altitude.

00:49:52.930 --> 00:49:56.010
And your eardrum bulges
because the eardrum is just

00:49:56.010 --> 00:50:00.080
a very thin layer of skin,
and it can bulge very easily.

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:02.400
But it's painful
when the eardrum

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.170
bulges when the
change in pressure

00:50:05.170 --> 00:50:07.060
happens as you're
descending in a plane.

00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:11.560
In the air-filled
space of the middle ear

00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:16.420
are three small bones,
the malleus, the incus,

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.620
and the stapes.

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:22.590
If you remember from high school
biology, the hammer, the anvil,

00:50:22.590 --> 00:50:23.640
and the stirrup.

00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.950
The stirrup looks like what
a cowboy has on his saddle

00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:29.820
that he puts the
cowboy boots through.

00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:31.530
It's a very, very small bone.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:33.820
In fact, it's the
smallest bone in the body.

00:50:35.406 --> 00:50:37.030
These bones are very
small because they

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:39.950
have to vibrate in
response to sound,

00:50:39.950 --> 00:50:41.740
and so they can't
be big and massive.

00:50:41.740 --> 00:50:43.870
Massive things don't
vibrate very well.

00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:53.230
And so the stapes is sometimes
encompassed by bony growths

00:50:53.230 --> 00:50:56.320
around it and prevented
from vibration

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:57.920
in a disease called
otosclerosis.

00:50:59.430 --> 00:51:01.625
And so at my hospital,
the Massachusetts Eye

00:51:01.625 --> 00:51:04.370
and Ear Infirmary,
they do an operation

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:08.280
to cure that type of deafness
called the stapedectomy.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.770
So what's an -ectomy?

00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:12.116
You medical types,
what does that mean?

00:51:12.116 --> 00:51:12.930
AUDIENCE: Removal.

00:51:12.930 --> 00:51:14.388
PROFESSOR: It means
removal, right.

00:51:14.388 --> 00:51:15.790
So they take the stapes out.

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:19.330
And that's because if
they just loosen it up,

00:51:19.330 --> 00:51:23.210
the bone regrows and re-adheres
the stapes from vibration.

00:51:23.210 --> 00:51:26.920
So they replace the
stapes, the natural stapes,

00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:32.160
with a stapes prosthesis, either
a little piston or a tube,

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.740
that they hook on with
a wire to the incus,

00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:39.850
and they put into the so-called
foot plate area or oval

00:51:39.850 --> 00:51:42.840
window of the cochlea, which
is the next structure I'll

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.060
talk about.

00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:47.440
And that very nicely restores
the sense of hearing.

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.046
In fact, when I was a postdoc
fellow at Mass Eye and Ear,

00:51:51.046 --> 00:51:54.890
I could go watch the surgeries,
and I watched a stapedectomy.

00:51:54.890 --> 00:51:57.970
And the patient was
anesthetized, but not

00:51:57.970 --> 00:52:00.380
so much that she was really out.

00:52:00.380 --> 00:52:01.550
She was more sedated.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.690
And at the end of the
operation, the surgeon

00:52:04.690 --> 00:52:08.050
was adjusting the
artificial prosthesis,

00:52:08.050 --> 00:52:10.710
and the surgeon said,
well, can you hear me?

00:52:10.710 --> 00:52:12.900
And the patient didn't respond.

00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.720
So he moved it around a little
bit or adjusted the wire,

00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.800
I don't know which.

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:18.350
He says, can you hear me now?

00:52:18.350 --> 00:52:21.180
And there was no response
from the patient.

00:52:21.180 --> 00:52:23.510
And he did a little more
manipulation and adjustment.

00:52:23.510 --> 00:52:25.480
And he finally said,
can you hear me?

00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:27.500
And the patient said, why
are you yelling at me?

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:28.605
I can hear you just fine.

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:31.680
So usually at the
end of the operation,

00:52:31.680 --> 00:52:34.320
the patient has
become more light.

00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:36.860
The anesthesiologist
turns off the anesthesia.

00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:40.930
And they adjust the stapes
prosthesis so it works well.

00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:46.530
So that type of operation
is fairly common

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:50.640
and very successful to
restore the so-called types

00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:52.250
of conductive hearing loss.

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:56.735
These bones conduct the acoustic
sensation into the cochlea.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:02.570
Now, in the cochlea-- this
is the structure here.

00:53:02.570 --> 00:53:05.180
The "cochlea" is the
word for the inner ear.

00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:09.770
It comes from the Greek word
"kokhlias," which means snail,

00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:14.570
and it is certainly a
snail shell-shaped capsule.

00:53:14.570 --> 00:53:18.510
The cochlea looks like
a coiled snail shell.

00:53:18.510 --> 00:53:22.650
And inside it are
the receptor cells

00:53:22.650 --> 00:53:25.690
for hearing, the hair
cells and the dendrites

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:27.700
of the auditory nerve fibers.

00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:28.200
OK?

00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:31.930
And the cochlea is a
bony-filled capsule

00:53:31.930 --> 00:53:35.025
filled with fluid and
membranes and cells inside.

00:53:36.250 --> 00:53:38.600
And this anatomy is
a little bit complex,

00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.970
so I brought in a model here
of the auditory periphery.

00:53:41.970 --> 00:53:45.960
So we have the external
ear, the long ear canal

00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:47.430
here, the eardrum.

00:53:47.430 --> 00:53:50.220
It's kind of slanted here.

00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:52.850
And this part here
that I'll lift out here

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:58.010
is the cochlea or the inner ear,
the snail shell-shaped area.

00:53:58.010 --> 00:54:01.650
And leading from it is the
yellow-colored, in this case,

00:54:01.650 --> 00:54:05.470
auditory nerve, which sends
messages from the cochlea

00:54:05.470 --> 00:54:07.160
into the brain.

00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:10.790
And these funny, loop-shaped
structures that I'm grasping

00:54:10.790 --> 00:54:15.450
are the semicircular
canals, which

00:54:15.450 --> 00:54:18.336
mediate the sense of balance
or angular acceleration.

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:22.610
When you rotate your head,
those hair cells in there

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:24.625
are sensitive to
those rotations.

00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:26.480
OK.

00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.380
So I'll pass this model around.

00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:30.760
You can take a
closer look at it.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:35.830
And in our hospital,
the surgeons practice

00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:41.620
on real, live specimens like
that from postmortem material

00:54:41.620 --> 00:54:44.440
because in otologic
surgery there's

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:49.150
a lot of drilling to access,
for example, the middle ear

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:50.960
or the inner ear.

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:53.680
And there's a lot of
important structures

00:54:53.680 --> 00:54:56.210
that you don't want to run
into with your drill bit,

00:54:56.210 --> 00:54:59.880
like the jugular bulb
is that red thing there.

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.620
The facial nerve goes right
through the middle ear.

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.030
And so the surgeons need to know
their way around the middle ear

00:55:07.030 --> 00:55:09.700
so that they can avoid
important structures

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:13.158
and go to the right structure
that they intend to operate on.

00:55:18.911 --> 00:55:19.410
OK.

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:24.390
So you heard Dr. Schiller
talk about electrophysiology

00:55:24.390 --> 00:55:27.880
and recordings from
individual neurons.

00:55:27.880 --> 00:55:32.250
And a lot of what we know
about how the inner ear works

00:55:32.250 --> 00:55:34.316
comes from such
types of experiments.

00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:40.280
And this is an experiment
at the top here

00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:43.915
that gives the responses in
the form of action potentials.

00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:48.750
Each one of these blips is
a little action potential,

00:55:48.750 --> 00:55:54.180
or impulse, or response from
one single auditory nerve

00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:58.860
fiber recorded in the
auditory nerve of a cat, which

00:55:58.860 --> 00:56:02.500
is the very common model
for auditory neuroscience,

00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.730
or at least it
was in years past.

00:56:06.750 --> 00:56:13.410
So this response area is a
mapping of sound frequency.

00:56:13.410 --> 00:56:16.160
So this axis is tone frequency.

00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.360
And the frequency
of a sound wave form

00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:22.450
is simply how many times
it repeats back and forth

00:56:22.450 --> 00:56:23.085
per second.

00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:27.390
Frequencies that are
common in human hearing

00:56:27.390 --> 00:56:30.810
are, for example, 1,000 hertz.

00:56:30.810 --> 00:56:34.165
This is a graph of kilohertz,
tone frequency in kilohertz.

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:36.960
And the upper limit
of human hearing

00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.895
is approximately 20 kilohertz.

00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:45.590
The lower limit of human hearing
is down around 50 or 100 hertz.

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:48.580
In terms of smaller
animals like the cat,

00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:53.230
they're shifted up in frequency
of perhaps an octave, maybe

00:56:53.230 --> 00:56:56.800
a doubling of the frequencies
that they're most sensitive to.

00:56:57.880 --> 00:57:00.780
This auditory nerve
fiber responded

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:04.650
to a variety of frequencies,
except at the very lowest

00:57:04.650 --> 00:57:06.090
sound level.

00:57:06.090 --> 00:57:09.160
The y-axis is a
graph of sound level.

00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:12.910
This is very low
level or soft sound,

00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:14.930
this would be a
medium sound, and this

00:57:14.930 --> 00:57:16.600
would be a very
high level sound.

00:57:17.930 --> 00:57:21.650
At the lowest levels of sound,
the auditory nerve fiber

00:57:21.650 --> 00:57:24.490
only gave a response
to frequencies

00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:29.680
around 10 kilohertz, or
10,000 cycles per second.

00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:34.470
There are some spontaneous
firings from the nerve fiber,

00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:37.630
and those can happen even if
there's no sound presentation.

00:57:37.630 --> 00:57:39.830
These neurons can be
spontaneously active.

00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:44.280
If you outline
this response area,

00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.950
you can see that it's
very sharply tuned

00:57:46.950 --> 00:57:48.030
to sound frequency.

00:57:48.030 --> 00:57:51.140
It only responds
around 10 kilohertz.

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:55.190
And this exquisitely sharp
tuning of the auditory nerve

00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:58.550
is the way, perhaps, that the
auditory nerve sends messages

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:02.480
to the brain that there is only
10 kilohertz that the ears are

00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:06.395
hearing and not 9 kilohertz
and not 11 kilohertz.

00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:08.280
OK?

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:12.350
If you increase the sound
level to higher levels,

00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:14.510
this auditory nerve
fiber, like others,

00:58:14.510 --> 00:58:17.670
responds to a wide variety
of sound frequencies,

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:21.530
but it has a very sharp cut
off at the high frequency edge.

00:58:21.530 --> 00:58:24.390
Maybe at 11 kilohertz,
it responds,

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:27.860
but 11.1 kilohertz
there's no response.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:30.450
So the tuning becomes
broader, but there's still

00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:33.870
a really nice, sharp,
high-frequency cut off.

00:58:33.870 --> 00:58:35.660
So what good is this for?

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:39.610
Well, the ear is very good at
resolving frequency, saying

00:58:39.610 --> 00:58:42.790
there's 10 kilohertz
but not 9 kilohertz.

00:58:42.790 --> 00:58:46.610
And that's very important
for identification of sounds.

00:58:46.610 --> 00:58:50.700
For example, how do we know, if
we're talking on the telephone

00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:54.000
or not seeing the subject
who's talking to us,

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.110
that it's a female
speaker or a male speaker

00:58:57.110 --> 00:58:58.980
or an infant speaker?

00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.900
Well, male speakers
have lower frequencies

00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.510
in their speech sounds.

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:08.350
And so right away, if we
hear a lot of low frequencies

00:59:08.350 --> 00:59:10.460
in the speech sounds,
we assume we're

00:59:10.460 --> 00:59:12.200
talking to a male speaker.

00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:15.330
And that's, of course, a very
important identification.

00:59:15.330 --> 00:59:19.220
How do we know we're
hearing the vowel A and not

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:22.930
the vowel E, ah or eh?

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:25.500
Because of the different
frequencies in the speech

00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:28.540
sounds for those two vowels.

00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:32.320
So frequency coding is
a very important subject

00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:35.640
in the auditory pathway
for identification

00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.015
and distinguishing
different types of sounds.

00:59:39.450 --> 00:59:43.650
And one way we know what
frequencies we're listening to

00:59:43.650 --> 00:59:46.190
is if the auditory
nerve fiber's tuned

00:59:46.190 --> 00:59:48.080
to a particular
frequency [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:49.760
responding and not the others.

00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:54.240
Now, some very
elegant studies have

00:59:54.240 --> 01:00:00.100
been done to look at
the mapping of frequency

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:02.105
along the spiral of the cochlea.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:05.700
And what those show
is that way down

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:09.370
at the base of the cochlea,
the very highest frequencies

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:12.730
are sensed by the hair cells
and the auditory nerve fibers

01:00:12.730 --> 01:00:13.230
there.

01:00:14.530 --> 01:00:17.330
And as you go more
and more apically,

01:00:17.330 --> 01:00:21.630
you arrive at first middle,
and then lower frequencies.

01:00:21.630 --> 01:00:24.390
So there's a very
nice, orderly mapping

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:29.020
of frequency along the
receptor epithelium,

01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.450
or along the cochlea in
the sense of hearing.

01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:35.150
And so, obviously,
the hearing organ

01:00:35.150 --> 01:00:38.170
is set up to distinguish
frequencies and identify

01:00:38.170 --> 01:00:38.670
sounds.

01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:42.670
OK.

01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:48.030
So that's not the only code for
sound frequency that we have.

01:00:48.030 --> 01:00:51.840
We'll talk extensively
about another code

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.190
that uses a time-coding sense.

01:00:56.190 --> 01:01:00.420
And this comes from the way
that auditory nerve fibers

01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:04.070
so-called phase lock to
the sound's waveform.

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:11.270
Here's a sound stimulus, and
here's auditory firing, first

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:12.450
with no stimulus.

01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:13.905
It's a fairly random pattern.

01:01:15.310 --> 01:01:18.520
And here is with a
stimulus turned on,

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:24.070
and you can see that the spikes
line up during a certain phase

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:27.210
or part of the
stimulus waveform.

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:29.490
And that's not that
impressive until you

01:01:29.490 --> 01:01:32.660
look at the time scale here.

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:36.910
As I said before, sounds that
are important in human hearing

01:01:36.910 --> 01:01:40.275
are as high in frequency
as 1 kilohertz.

01:01:41.470 --> 01:01:46.360
So if this is going back and
forth 1,000 times per second,

01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:50.200
then the scale bar here for one
period would be 1 millisecond.

01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:55.400
And so the auditory nerve is
keeping track and firing only

01:01:55.400 --> 01:02:00.070
on a certain or preferential
phase of the stimulus waveform

01:02:00.070 --> 01:02:02.940
with the capability
of milliseconds.

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:03.440
OK?

01:02:03.440 --> 01:02:08.350
And this is a much better
phase-locking pattern

01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:09.790
than you get in other senses.

01:02:09.790 --> 01:02:12.160
For example, in
the visual system,

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:17.680
when you flash the light on
and off just even 100 flashes

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.590
per second, everything
sort of blears out,

01:02:21.590 --> 01:02:24.360
and you sort of don't
have any phase locking

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:27.560
the way you do in the
auditory nerves firing.

01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:32.290
So this is a very nice coding
for sound frequency that

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.960
is sort of a
secondary way to code.

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:40.050
This is a very important
coding for musical sounds.

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:44.400
Musical sounds, for
example, like an octave,

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.570
1 kilohertz and 2 kilohertz,
a doubling of sound frequency,

01:02:49.570 --> 01:02:53.960
have very similar patterns
in their temporal responses

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.320
to those two frequencies
that probably

01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.290
makes an octave a very beautiful
musical interval to listen to.

01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:05.860
And it appears in music of many
different types of cultures.

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.600
So one of the
demonstrations that I'll

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:12.170
play for you is
an A for 40 hertz

01:03:12.170 --> 01:03:15.990
and an octave above that,
880 hertz, and you'll

01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:19.310
hear how beautiful the
two sound together.

01:03:19.310 --> 01:03:21.900
And then I'll mistune
them, which is easy for me

01:03:21.900 --> 01:03:24.670
to do because I'm an
amateur violinist,

01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:26.410
and I'll be doing
this on a violin.

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:30.680
And it's pretty easy to
have a mistuned octave,

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.550
and it sounds so awful
and very dissonant

01:03:33.550 --> 01:03:35.160
when you listen to it.

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.730
And one of the reasons for
that, the reason for that,

01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:41.090
is the difference
in phase locking

01:03:41.090 --> 01:03:45.382
for the two dissonant sounds
versus the two consonant

01:03:45.382 --> 01:03:45.881
sounds.

01:03:50.341 --> 01:03:50.840
OK.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.960
So we will talk
about what happens

01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:56.395
when you have problems
with your hearing.

01:03:58.410 --> 01:04:01.100
One of the main
problems with hearing

01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.340
that causes loss,
complete loss of hearing,

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:10.200
is when the receptor
cells are attacked

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.770
by various types of
insults, diseases, drugs,

01:04:15.770 --> 01:04:20.120
the aging process,
stimulation, or listening

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.370
to very high-level sounds.

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:24.270
These can all kill
the hair cells.

01:04:25.550 --> 01:04:28.890
And in the mammalian cochlea,
once the hair cells are lost

01:04:28.890 --> 01:04:30.700
they never grow back.

01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:33.070
And there's very active
interest in trying

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.720
to get hair cells to
regenerate by using

01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:38.910
stem cells or various
growth factors,

01:04:38.910 --> 01:04:40.485
but so far that
can't be achieved.

01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:45.160
Luckily, in the
auditory periphery,

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:47.860
even if you lose the
hair cells, which

01:04:47.860 --> 01:04:50.700
is the major cause
of deafness, you

01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.310
retain your auditory
nerve fibers.

01:04:53.310 --> 01:04:57.050
So these blue structures here
are the auditory nerve fibers

01:04:57.050 --> 01:04:59.070
coming from the hair cells.

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:02.480
And even if the hair
cells are killed

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.330
by these various insults,
the auditory nerve fibers,

01:05:05.330 --> 01:05:06.745
or at least many
of them, remain.

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:12.550
So you heard Dr. Schiller talk
about electrical stimulation.

01:05:13.700 --> 01:05:16.880
You can put an electrical
stimulating electrode

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:21.590
in the inner ear and stimulate
those remaining auditory nerve

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:25.510
fibers to fire impulses
that are sent to the brain.

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:27.490
And if you hook that
system up right,

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.065
you have a so-called
cochlear implant.

01:05:30.065 --> 01:05:35.530
The cochlear implant has a
microphone that detects sound.

01:05:35.530 --> 01:05:41.760
It has a processor that converts
that sound into various pulses

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.990
of electrical stimulating
current, which

01:05:43.990 --> 01:05:46.700
can be applied to a
system of electrodes

01:05:46.700 --> 01:05:49.360
that is inserted
into the cochlea.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:53.710
The cochlea is a
beautiful bony capsule.

01:05:53.710 --> 01:05:55.990
You can snake this electrode in.

01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:57.100
It doesn't move away.

01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:58.360
You can glue it in place.

01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:02.830
You can lead the electrode
out to the processor that

01:06:02.830 --> 01:06:08.160
activates it when the
subject hears a sound that's

01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.830
detected by the microphone.

01:06:09.830 --> 01:06:14.520
And this cochlear implant
is the most successful

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:17.460
neural prosthesis
that's been developed.

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:21.700
It's implanted all the time
at Mass Eye and Ear Infirmary.

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.950
It's paid for by insurance.

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:27.680
These days, insurance pays
for a cochlear implant

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.545
in your left cochlea
if you're deaf,

01:06:29.545 --> 01:06:32.230
and it will also pay for
another cochlear implant

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:35.310
in your right cochlea
if you're deaf.

01:06:35.310 --> 01:06:38.790
So the metric for how
successful this is,

01:06:38.790 --> 01:06:41.940
is whether the subject who's
using the cochlear implant

01:06:41.940 --> 01:06:43.090
can understand speech.

01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:47.750
And so you can have
various tests of speech.

01:06:47.750 --> 01:06:51.510
A speaker can give a sentence,
and the person can respond.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:55.780
The speaker can give
various simple words,

01:06:55.780 --> 01:06:57.710
and the cochlear implant
user can respond.

01:06:57.710 --> 01:07:02.021
You can test these individuals
in a very straightforward

01:07:02.021 --> 01:07:02.520
manner.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.310
And we will have a demonstration
by a cochlear implant user.

01:07:07.310 --> 01:07:11.720
I have an undergraduate
demonstrator who's here at MIT.

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:15.300
And she'll come in and
she'll describe and show you

01:07:15.300 --> 01:07:18.790
her cochlear implant, and
you can ask her questions.

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:23.150
And there, I guarantee you with
this particular demonstration

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:25.720
that I have in mind,
that she won't always

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.870
understand your questions.

01:07:27.870 --> 01:07:31.780
I have had really great
cochlear implant users

01:07:31.780 --> 01:07:34.810
who are superstars, that
understand every word.

01:07:34.810 --> 01:07:38.470
But the more norm is they
understand much of what you say

01:07:38.470 --> 01:07:40.150
but not everything.

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:42.840
And this particular room is
a little bit challenging.

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:44.545
There's some noise
in the background.

01:07:45.750 --> 01:07:49.100
It's not one-on-one,
so the implant user

01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:52.080
won't know exactly
who's speaking at once.

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.780
And in this case, the person
just has one ear implanted,

01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:01.840
so her ability to localize
sounds is compromised.

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.980
And she won't know who's asking
the question until she sort

01:08:04.980 --> 01:08:07.200
of zeroes in a little bit on it.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:11.700
So you'll see the cochlear
implant is not perfect,

01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:15.200
but it's pretty
good in its metric

01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:16.899
for speech comprehension.

01:08:22.230 --> 01:08:22.730
OK.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:27.340
Now, I said this particular
cochlear implant user only

01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:29.149
has one implant in one ear.

01:08:30.565 --> 01:08:34.590
To really be good
at localizing sound,

01:08:34.590 --> 01:08:37.770
we need to have
two ears, and there

01:08:37.770 --> 01:08:40.809
are the so-called binaural
cues for sound localization.

01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:46.779
Here's a subject listening
to a sound source.

01:08:46.779 --> 01:08:49.420
The sound source is
emitting sound here,

01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:52.454
and it gets to the
subject's left ear first.

01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.950
And a short time later, it gets
to the subject's right ear.

01:08:56.950 --> 01:09:01.580
And that's one of the cues for
binaural localization of sound,

01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:03.800
which is interaural
time difference.

01:09:04.830 --> 01:09:10.814
The velocity of sound in air
is 342 meters per second.

01:09:12.279 --> 01:09:14.490
And depending on how
big your head is,

01:09:14.490 --> 01:09:18.080
you can calculate the
Interaural Time Difference.

01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.890
And of course,
that ITD is maximal

01:09:20.890 --> 01:09:25.529
if the sound source is
located off to one side,

01:09:25.529 --> 01:09:27.791
and it's exactly zero
if the sound source

01:09:27.791 --> 01:09:29.390
is located straight ahead.

01:09:30.290 --> 01:09:30.790
OK?

01:09:30.790 --> 01:09:34.340
So that is a cue for
localization of sounds.

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:38.051
We'll listen to sounds that
differ in interaural time

01:09:38.051 --> 01:09:38.550
difference.

01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:41.080
We can play these through
headphones for you.

01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.990
And we'll have some
demonstrations of that.

01:09:44.290 --> 01:09:47.189
The other binaural cue
for sound localization

01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:50.500
is the interaural
level difference.

01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.075
Here is the same sound
source, same subject.

01:09:54.380 --> 01:09:59.370
This ear will experience a
slightly higher sound level

01:09:59.370 --> 01:10:02.840
than the other ear because
sound can't perfectly

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:04.305
bend around the head.

01:10:04.305 --> 01:10:06.670
The head creates a sound shadow.

01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:10.670
And this is especially important
for high frequencies of sound,

01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:13.130
like above 3 kilohertz.

01:10:13.130 --> 01:10:17.340
So that is a second binaural
cue for sound localization.

01:10:18.470 --> 01:10:21.160
We'll listen to those cues.

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:26.120
And we'll talk a lot about
the brainstem processing

01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:28.593
of those binaural cues
for sound localization.

01:10:29.610 --> 01:10:33.930
If you compare the visual
and the auditory pathways--

01:10:33.930 --> 01:10:36.470
this is a block diagram
of the auditory pathway,

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:39.440
and there are a lot
of brainstem nuclei.

01:10:40.670 --> 01:10:45.900
We have the cochlear nucleus,
the superior olivary complex,

01:10:45.900 --> 01:10:48.065
and the inferior colliculus.

01:10:48.065 --> 01:10:53.030
And these latter two get input
from the two ears on the two

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:56.190
sides, and they
probably do the bulk

01:10:56.190 --> 01:10:59.406
of the neural processing
for sound localization.

01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:04.020
You don't have to do that
so much in the visual system

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:05.910
because the visual
system, in a sense,

01:11:05.910 --> 01:11:09.515
has a mapping of external
space already on the retina.

01:11:10.540 --> 01:11:13.920
But remember, the inner
ears map sound frequency.

01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.850
And so the inner ears
themselves don't know

01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:19.730
or don't have a
good cue for where

01:11:19.730 --> 01:11:22.220
the sound is localized in space.

01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:25.750
Instead, you need input
from the two sides,

01:11:25.750 --> 01:11:28.610
and you need a lot
of neural processing

01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:31.640
to help you determine
where that sound source is

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.200
coming from in space.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:35.380
OK.

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.440
So we'll talk about
the neural processing

01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.815
of those binaural cues.

01:11:41.060 --> 01:11:42.920
We'll talk toward
the end of the course

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.940
about the various
auditory cortical fields.

01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:50.780
These are the cortical fields
in the side of the cat's brain.

01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:54.090
So this is the
front of the brain.

01:11:54.090 --> 01:11:56.220
This is looking at the
left side of the brain.

01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.360
This is the rear of the brain
where the occipital lobes are,

01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:01.650
where V1 is.

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:03.650
And on the side or
temporal cortex,

01:12:03.650 --> 01:12:06.340
you have the auditory
fields, including

01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.000
A1 or primary auditory cortex.

01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:13.720
And we'll talk, at least
touch upon a little bit,

01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.190
toward the end of the course
the human auditory-- primary

01:12:18.190 --> 01:12:21.820
auditory cortical field is right
here on the superior surface

01:12:21.820 --> 01:12:25.850
of the superior temporal gyrus.

01:12:25.850 --> 01:12:29.930
And just near it, it could be
called an auditory association

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:33.090
area, is an area
called Wernicke's area

01:12:33.090 --> 01:12:35.925
that's very important in
processing of language.

01:12:36.970 --> 01:12:38.480
And of course,
connected with that

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:41.790
is the Broca's area, which
is another important language

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:46.270
center, in the dominant
hemisphere at least, of humans.

01:12:46.270 --> 01:12:49.880
So we'll touch upon that at
the very end of the course.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:54.240
And we'll also have a special
topic called bat echolocation,

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:59.320
how bats use their auditory
sense to navigate around

01:12:59.320 --> 01:13:01.670
the world at night even
without their vision.

01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:07.730
And finally, at the very last
class period before the review

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:11.950
sessions, we'll all go over
for a tour of the research lab

01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:14.650
where I work at the
Massachusetts Eye and Ear

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:15.810
Infirmary.

01:13:15.810 --> 01:13:19.150
So it's across the Longfellow
Bridge right at the end

01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:21.530
there where the arrow is.

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:24.570
And we'll have some
demonstrations there.

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:27.210
I think last year we
had a demonstration

01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:31.640
on single-unit recording
from an awake animal that's

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:32.735
listening to sound.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:38.140
We had measurements from humans
of the so-called otoacoustic

01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:38.860
emissions.

01:13:38.860 --> 01:13:41.540
These are sounds
that can be detected

01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:44.630
in the ear canal with a
very sensitive microphone.

01:13:44.630 --> 01:13:47.100
They're used in
tests of hearing.

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.890
And I also think
we had a discussion

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:52.560
of imaging of the
auditory system.

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:56.720
And of course, if you've ever
listened to an MRI machine,

01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.620
it's sort of described
sometimes as being

01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:01.850
as loud as being inside
a washing machine.

01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:04.670
And it's very
challenging for people

01:14:04.670 --> 01:14:07.650
that image subjects
who are listening

01:14:07.650 --> 01:14:10.270
to especially very
low-level sounds

01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:14.270
when there's all this background
noise coming from the imaging

01:14:14.270 --> 01:14:14.770
machine.

01:14:14.770 --> 01:14:16.640
So there's some
special things that

01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:19.390
are done to minimize
the noise coming

01:14:19.390 --> 01:14:23.550
from the imager in
auditory studies.

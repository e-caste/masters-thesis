[DIGITAL EFFECTS]

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.280
NANCY KANWISHER:
So to remind you,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.090
we've been talking last
week about doing two things

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.137
at once-- asking all sort of
questions of what we might want

00:00:18.137 --> 00:00:20.220
to know about face perception
in the brain-- there

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.450
are some questions.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.957
But at the same
time, the agenda has

00:00:22.957 --> 00:00:24.540
been to consider the
different methods

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.030
available in human cognitive
neuroscience and what kinds

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.400
of questions each
one can answer.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.422
So last week, we talked
about a bunch of them,

00:00:31.422 --> 00:00:32.880
and today, we're
going to wrap this

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.245
up talking about TMS
and animal studies.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:38.370
But first, I just want to
remind you very briefly--

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.720
I won't go through in
excruciating detail--

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.690
we talked about
behavioral methods, which

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.360
are great for characterizing
internal representations,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.410
as you saw with face
inversion effects and some

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.510
of the other
behavioral data, they

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.330
have major disadvantages, which
is that with behavior, you're

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:55.650
just measuring the output.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.000
It's pretty sparse.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.880
And from that, you have to infer
all the stuff that happened in

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.754
between the retina-- or whatever
your sensory modality is--

00:01:03.754 --> 00:01:04.379
and the output.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.970
All that internal
mental stuff you

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.780
have to infer just
from the output.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.572
So it's amazing that
that works at all,

00:01:09.572 --> 00:01:11.280
and you have to be
really smart to do it.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.890
And lots of people have been
doing that for a long time,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.270
but it's challenging.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.980
So why not look inside?

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.940
And one of the best ways
to do that, of course,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:19.690
is functional MRI.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.420
It has the best
spatial resolution

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.880
available for normal subjects.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.890
But as you guys all
seem to pick up on,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.040
its temporal
resolution is lousy,

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.390
and its ability to tell you
whether the neural activity

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.970
you're looking at is
causally involved in behavior

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.457
is like nil.

00:01:38.457 --> 00:01:39.540
Now, at least one of you--

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.700
I only read a few
of the assignments--

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.200
but at least one
of you was confused

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.690
about which causal role
we're talking about.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.130
And this is actually
really important.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.700
So let's take a moment
to talk about this.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.680
Causality, the
idea of causality--

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.550
if x causes y, that means,
essentially, y wouldn't have

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.580
happened without x,
or y happened more

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.520
because x happened,
when x happens

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.050
than when x doesn't happen.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.270
So that's pretty basic.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.330
So that means if you want to
test the causal role of x on y,

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.460
you have to mess with x.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.950
That's the key challenge.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.790
OK, so with that in mind,
here's this whole causal chain.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.500
A stimulus lands on a retina.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.270
A bunch of neural
activity happens,

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.950
and some behavioral
output happens.

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.720
So there's a whole
causal chain there.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.620
Now, let's consider what kind of
causality we're talking about.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.830
There's one kind which is
that the stimulus causes

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.530
neural activity in the brain.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.290
That's a kind of causality
that we can absolutely

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.810
test, even if we're measuring
that with functional MRI,

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.790
because we can mess
with the stimulus.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.800
We can present different
stimuli and produce

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.960
different neural activity, OK?

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.680
So in that case, we can
look at the causal effect

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.510
of the stimulus on
the neural activity.

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:52.380
No problem.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.170
That's standard.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.870
That's what we do, pretty much,
in every experiment with ERPs,

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:59.310
or functional MRI, or so forth.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.600
Is that clear?

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.510
OK, on the other
hand, if we want

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.350
to know this kind of causality
from some neural activity we

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.680
measure in the brain to
either a behavioral response,

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.680
or a subjective feeling reported
by a behavioral response,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.290
or something like that,
that's the challenging part.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.080
That's the kind of causality
that we can't infer

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.030
from ERPs or functional MRI.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.010
Everyone got that?

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.170
Yeah, OK, it's sort of
obvious and not obvious.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.128
OK, so let's talk
a little bit more

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:33.420
about that temporal resolution.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.280
I know I kept saying
the temporal resolution

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.190
of functional MRI is lousy,
but I had run out of time

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.410
and skipped through the key
slide, So let me back up

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.770
and do that here.

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.910
This is the BOLD or MRI
response as a function of time.

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:47.430
This is an idealized
version of it,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.830
but it looks kind of like that.

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.430
And sorry these things are tiny
here, but these are seconds--

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.360
5 seconds, 10 seconds.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.240
So let me show you
what that means.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.300
If you're recording
neural activity,

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.720
back here, in the first stage of
visual processing in the cortex

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.640
coming up from the
eyes-- which is where?

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.110
AUDIENCE: The occipital lobe.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.818
NANCY KANWISHER: The
occipital lobe, yes.

00:04:14.818 --> 00:04:15.560
What area?

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.560
AUDIENCE: Primary visual cortex.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.560
NANCY KANWISHER: Primary
visual cortex, exactly.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.990
OK, so suppose that
we stuck an electrode

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:25.470
in my primary visual
cortex, and we flashed up

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.570
a very brief visual display.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.900
OK, here's a visual stimulus, on
for maybe a tenth of a second--

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.390
bright, flashing
thing V1 loves--

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.210
V1, also primary
visual cortex, right?

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.090
OK, the neural activity would
happen in less than 1/10

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.170
of a second-- super fast.

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:43.020
We know that from
work in animals

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.820
and even some work
in humans, OK?

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.715
So super fast
after the stimulus.

00:04:47.715 --> 00:04:50.370
It just goes straight up
from the retina, the LGN V1--

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.630
boom, there it is.

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.180
So all the neural activity
happens right there,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.850
and it ends right there.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.810
But the MRI response is
five, six seconds later--

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:04.650
this big, sloppy, slow
thing as the blood slashes

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.260
into V1 many seconds after
the relevant neural activity.

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:13.140
So what's relevant here is
not just that it's delayed,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:15.630
but it's big and sloppy.

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.480
And so both of those
things are the reasons

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.340
why functional MRI responses
aren't good for distinguishing

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.940
what happens on a fine temporal
scale of, say, events less

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.890
than a second.

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:34.120
All right, OK, in
contrast, as I mentioned,

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.790
when you glue
electrodes on the scalp,

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:39.270
or stick these fancy magnetic
sensors in the big hairdryer

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.700
device around your
head, there you

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.620
get beautiful
temporal resolution,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.720
but it's like the
Heisenberg principle

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.950
of cognitive neuroscience.

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.200
You want time, you
don't get space.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:53.700
OK, and similarly,
here, we can measure

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:59.910
the causal effect on scalp
response neural responses,

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.470
but not the causal role of those
neural responses on behavior.

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.200
Everyone clear with this?

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.030
OK.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.490
OK, then I talked
about these rare cases

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.550
where we can record
directly from the surface

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:17.130
of the human brain with
electrical activity, where

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.020
we now get both space and
time at the same time.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.950
And the key disadvantage
there, of course,

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:25.710
is that it's extremely invasive.

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:29.220
You have to take a big piece
of skull off to get in there.

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:30.960
And, of course, that
would only happen

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.410
in the case of people
who are already in pretty

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.500
serious medical circumstances.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.620
OK, so now, when we have
this incredible opportunity

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.980
to record this amazing data
from the center of the brain,

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.950
does that enable us to make
this kind of causal inference

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.525
from neural activity
to behavior?

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:53.910
Yes?

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.255
What do you think, yes?

00:06:55.255 --> 00:06:55.755
No?

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.140
Isabelle?

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:02.010
Is that Isabelle?

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.000
Yes.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.936
Why are you shaking your head?

00:07:04.936 --> 00:07:06.720
AUDIENCE: Because
it just tells us

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.170
which neurons are
responsible for [INAUDIBLE]..

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.420
NANCY KANWISHER: That's right.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.340
It's cooler, it's
fancier, it's more

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.000
impressive than
functional MRI or ERPs,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.630
but it's still the same deal.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:22.520
We're just recording
responses, OK?

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.670
So we can do this
causality, from the stimulus

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.260
to those neural
responses, but it

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.420
doesn't tell us which
of those responses

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.640
are related to behavior yet.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.730
I showed you other methods that
do, but this one alone doesn't.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.230
Everybody got that?

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:41.390
All right, so then I talked
about studying patients

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.880
with focal brain damage.

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.000
And here, you really can
make a strong causal link

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.580
between a bit of brain
and a behavioral ability.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.100
You lose that bit of brain,
you can no longer do that task.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.870
That's a really direct
kind of causal role.

00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:59.360
I talked about
double associations.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.920
I gave it short shrift, but
it's actually really important.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.710
You should know it.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:07.490
A double dissociation is when
you have one patient who can do

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:11.240
A but not B-- say, recognize
objects but not faces--

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.690
and another patient who
can do B but not A--

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.850
say, recognize faces
but not objects.

00:08:16.850 --> 00:08:19.820
And when you have in the
literature two cases like that,

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.130
now you're in a
really strong position

00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:24.770
to infer that there's something
fundamentally different

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.900
about face recognition
and object recognition

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:27.960
in the brain.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.170
OK, so that's really
important-- the senses

00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.350
in which a double association
is more inferentially powerful

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:35.280
than a single association.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.277
OK, "more important" means
I'm sure to test you on it.

00:08:40.277 --> 00:08:42.860
No, it's also important, whether
I was going to test you on it

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:43.429
or not.

00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:44.510
[LAUGHS]

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:47.540
OK, and so, of course,
in focal brain damage,

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:52.430
we can absolutely infer causal
role from a bit of brain

00:08:52.430 --> 00:08:53.660
to a behavioral ability.

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:57.850
Lose that bit of brain,
lose the ability, yeah?

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.830
OK.

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.850
And the case that I showed
you with that amazing movie

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:06.820
of the guy getting stimulated
in his fusiform face area

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:09.760
and seeing percepts of faces on
top of whatever he looked at,

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.580
that's a quintessential
beautiful example

00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.220
of the causal role of
neural activity there.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:18.670
We're basically directly
manipulating neural activity.

00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:21.490
We're injecting neural
activity there electrically

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:26.410
and looking at the behavioral
and cognitive result that

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:26.980
occurs--

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.480
The guy.

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.570
Sees a hallucinatory face.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.190
OK, now, that is amazing
data, but as I mentioned,

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:37.310
they're very rare.

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.470
We have no control over it.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:41.020
When we get those data, we
celebrate and are all excited,

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.550
but mostly, we don't
get those data.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:48.610
Plus, those people have serious
problems with their brains.

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:50.680
That's why their brains
are being opened up.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.520
So is there any way
to test a causal role

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.850
of a particular part of the
brain in a normal subject

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:00.430
who doesn't have their
skull open for neurosurgery

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:03.530
and who has not
had brain damage?

00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.140
Well, there's one
way, and that's

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:08.380
called transcranial
magnetic stimulation, OK?

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.720
So in transcranial
magnetic stimulation,

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.650
you take a coil of
wire about yea big.

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.430
That's a tight-wrapped coil
of wire embedded in plastic,

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:21.100
connected to a
ginormous capacitor,

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.032
and you hold it
next to your head.

00:10:23.032 --> 00:10:24.490
Of course, that's
what you would do

00:10:24.490 --> 00:10:25.910
if you were a neuroscientist.

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.860
And you discharge and
make an enormous current

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:33.670
through that coil that's very,
very strong and very brief.

00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:36.310
The whole thing lasts
less than one millisecond.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:38.650
And you guys know from
8.02, another case

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:41.560
of the right-hand rule
coming to our service.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.690
You have a hell of a
current going in a coil.

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:46.282
What's going to happen in
brain tissue underneath?

00:10:49.495 --> 00:10:51.370
AUDIENCE: Increase the
magnetic [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:53.630
AUDIENCE: The electric
field will [INAUDIBLE]..

00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:55.680
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, exactly.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.820
And so you'll get electric
fields perpendicular

00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:01.820
to the coil sticking right
into the brain like that.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.490
And what do you think
happens if you stick a big,

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:07.220
huge transient electric
field-- boom!--

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:09.290
into your head like that.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.630
AUDIENCE: Isn't that a
magnetic field [INAUDIBLE]??

00:11:11.630 --> 00:11:12.380
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yeah, you're right.

00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:13.460
Right-hand rule
is magnetic field.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.252
I was thinking I was
misremembering, right?

00:11:15.252 --> 00:11:17.490
Electric current makes
magnetic field, right?

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.510
It was a long time
ago I took 8.02.

00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:23.900
I did-- just a long time ago.

00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:26.120
Anyway, for current
purposes, doesn't matter.

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.272
Either would do it.

00:11:27.272 --> 00:11:28.730
Actually, there's
a variant of this

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.800
where it's an electric
field, but it's

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.360
debated how well that works.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:35.690
OK, anyway, what
happens is you affect

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:39.740
neural activity in tissue right
underneath the skull, right?

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:45.853
OK, so if you want to
see a picture, a video

00:11:45.853 --> 00:11:47.270
of that happening,
there's a video

00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:49.465
of me getting zapped
with TMS on my website.

00:11:49.465 --> 00:11:50.340
You can check it out.

00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.440
It's kind of ludicrous.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:52.123
Yes, question?

00:11:52.123 --> 00:11:53.790
AUDIENCE: What's the
spatial resolution?

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.420
NANCY KANWISHER: Oh,
we're getting there.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.210
We're getting there.

00:11:56.210 --> 00:11:58.250
OK, here's an early
version of this.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.190
To generate these very strong
and brief magnetic fields,

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.500
they had these stacks
of coils like this,

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:04.940
and they rotated them around.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:06.170
It's a little crazy.

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:07.412
Here's a more recent version.

00:12:07.412 --> 00:12:08.870
It looks like a
big torture device,

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.120
but it's actually no big deal.

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.095
The guy's just holding
his head on a chin rest

00:12:12.095 --> 00:12:13.730
to hold his head
still, and there's

00:12:13.730 --> 00:12:18.240
a person holding the coil
next to his head like that.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.580
And so that enables us
to briefly and somewhat

00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:25.340
selectively disrupt a
little patch of cortex

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:29.180
there by sticking in
this big random field.

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:31.970
Now, spatial resolution
is not amazing--

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:35.362
maybe 1, 2 centimeters,
something like that, OK?

00:12:35.362 --> 00:12:37.070
It's better than you
might guess for such

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.755
an incredibly crude device--

00:12:38.755 --> 00:12:41.130
like something people would
have done hundreds years ago,

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.730
and yet we still do it today.

00:12:43.730 --> 00:12:48.620
You can also use a lovely method
where you scan the subject with

00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.770
functional MRI first, find a
particular functional region

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:54.350
that you're interested in in
that person's brain-- remember,

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:56.720
these things can vary in
their exact location across

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.650
subjects--

00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:02.060
and then find a way to register
externally on the scalp,

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:05.630
what is the closest spot to that
region you found in their brain

00:13:05.630 --> 00:13:07.070
previously with functional MRI?

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.950
And stick the coil right
there, and exactly titrate

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:13.310
its location with reference
to that brain image.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:17.010
So that makes this whole
enterprise more worthwhile.

00:13:17.010 --> 00:13:20.930
So what can TMS tell us
about face perception?

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.580
Well, here's the problem.

00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:25.940
Here's my fusiform face
area-- that guy right there.

00:13:25.940 --> 00:13:29.960
It's a few centimeters in from
the scalp-- from the skull.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.980
So that's a drag.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.620
Unless we opened up my head,
we can't reach it there

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:34.910
with the TMS coil.

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.920
Believe me, the first
time I had a chance

00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.140
to use a TMS coil, the
very first thing I did

00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.720
was stick the coil there,
crank it to the max,

00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:43.370
and try to see
what would happen.

00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.600
Not a damn thing happened.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.070
It was very disappointing.

00:13:46.070 --> 00:13:48.110
I knew lots of friends
who tried the same thing.

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:49.360
It was the most obvious thing.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.370
It just doesn't work;
it's too medial.

00:13:51.370 --> 00:13:51.870
Yeah?

00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:54.740
Well, there was a question
over here a moment ago?

00:13:54.740 --> 00:13:58.428
AUDIENCE: If you use TMS
near someone's brainstem--

00:13:58.428 --> 00:14:00.470
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah,
that wouldn't be so smart.

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.930
Luckily, the brainstem
is kind of deep in there.

00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:06.650
So if you were really
stupid and stuck it down,

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:09.320
I don't know, way in here, you
might be able to cause trouble.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:11.670
But mostly, people don't
stick it back there.

00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:13.670
And actually, the subjects
won't let you anyway,

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:15.295
because there is a
lot of neck muscles,

00:14:15.295 --> 00:14:18.980
and it really hurts when
you do TMS over muscles.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:21.620
And so if anybody had
such a stupid ideas

00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:25.610
to try to zap the
brainstem, the subject

00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:27.200
would probably
object immediately

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.600
before they got very far with
it, because it would hurt.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.900
[LAUGHS] And you
guys are all probably

00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:35.480
wondering, how safe is this?

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.707
It's not totally clear.

00:14:36.707 --> 00:14:38.540
There have been lots
of studies in animals--

00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:39.680
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:43.847
--where they zap a
rabbit 100,000 times

00:14:43.847 --> 00:14:45.680
or something like that
and say, well, rabbit

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:48.824
seems fine, hops around.

00:14:48.824 --> 00:14:51.320
And the best they can
do in animal studies.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.200
When I first used TMS
around 20 years ago,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.770
I read a few basic
safety studies,

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:59.540
and I thought,
god, I don't know.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.820
But I also realized that
if you look at the papers,

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:04.520
the initials of the subjects
were the same as the authors.

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:09.080
So I called them up, and I
said, hey, tell me honestly,

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:14.090
did you guys ever notice any
ill effects from getting zapped?

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:16.100
And the guy I talked
to said, yeah, I've

00:15:16.100 --> 00:15:19.610
been zapped about 10,000 times,
and I never noticed anything

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.770
except for one thing.

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.870
After a whole hour
of getting zapped,

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.930
it gave me a hell of a
craving for ice cream.

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:29.300
So I decided, OK, I
can live with that.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.460
We got it through the
human subjects committee,

00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.760
and we do-- not a lot,
but some TMS in my lab.

00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.233
And I'm probably now been
zapped at least as many times

00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:39.650
as that kind, and I guess you
guys can judge for yourself.

00:15:39.650 --> 00:15:41.275
So you don't have
the before condition,

00:15:41.275 --> 00:15:42.440
so it's a little hard.

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:46.050
Anyway, as far as anybody can
tell, it's perfectly safe.

00:15:46.050 --> 00:15:46.550
Yes?

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.425
AUDIENCE: So there are
some contraindications

00:15:48.425 --> 00:15:50.220
if you are prone to
seizures or if you're

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:50.753
on certain medications.

00:15:50.753 --> 00:15:51.560
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes, yes, yes.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.602
AUDIENCE: So if you ever
sign up for a TMS study,

00:15:53.602 --> 00:15:54.560
read the fine print.

00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:57.290
NANCY KANWISHER:
Good point, yep.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.570
OK, so back to this.

00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:02.090
It would be lovely
to zap that guy,

00:16:02.090 --> 00:16:04.430
but it's too hard to reach.

00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:07.610
OK, so then, this guy
David Pitcher came along,

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.440
and he had a very good idea.

00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:14.810
And my 1970s synopsis
of his idea--

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:17.690
paraphrasing still--
is if you can't

00:16:17.690 --> 00:16:20.810
zap the region you love,
love the region you can.

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:24.500
And so Pitcher said, hey, what
about that other guy there?

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.980
We haven't talked
a lot about it.

00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.340
It's sometimes called
the occipital face area.

00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.820
I think of it as a kind of
crappy version of the FFA.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.260
It's kind of face-selective.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.820
It's not as face-selective.

00:16:34.820 --> 00:16:37.340
It's more variable, so
it's not as fun to study,

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.350
but it's there in most people.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:41.720
I have a damn fine
one, I have to say--

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:46.130
many people do-- and it is right
out there next to the scalp,

00:16:46.130 --> 00:16:47.410
just asking for it.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:47.960
Right

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.070
OK, so here's what
David Pitcher did.

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:53.983
He gave subjects a--

00:16:53.983 --> 00:16:55.400
you need a behavioral
task, right?

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.010
Because in this case, we're
testing the causal role

00:16:58.010 --> 00:16:59.460
of a bit of brain on behavior.

00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:01.020
So we're going to
measure behavior.

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.300
And so what is our task?

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:04.760
OK, so here's his task.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.339
Sorry, it's a little tiny,
but this is one trial.

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:08.630
Time is going this way.

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:09.800
You present a face.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:10.849
There's a brief interval.

00:17:10.849 --> 00:17:12.260
You present another face.

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.690
And the task is just, are those
two faces same or different?

00:17:15.690 --> 00:17:18.290
It's your basic face
perception task.

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:22.040
But then, what you can do is
you can zap the occipital face

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.470
area at different time--

00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:27.500
during presentation
of that second face,

00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.510
and you can do it at
different time intervals.

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:32.120
Remember, its effect
is very brief.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.360
The actual magnetic change
is less than a millisecond.

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.100
OK, so here's what David
Pitcher found in that study.

00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:43.040
This is accuracy at the
same different matching

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:47.390
task when you stimulate
the right occipital face

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:48.860
area versus vertex--

00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:51.320
that means you stick the coil
up here, which is pretty far

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.520
away from face regions.

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.340
It's a control condition--
not a perfect one,

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.840
but better than nothing.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.990
By the way, TMS usually doesn't
hurt unless you stick it

00:17:59.990 --> 00:18:00.620
over muscles.

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:02.838
You stick it over the
frontal lobes, and--

00:18:02.838 --> 00:18:03.380
I don't know.

00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:06.140
Every time I try to disrupt
my language abilities,

00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:08.723
it hurts too much, because
there are muscles up there.

00:18:08.723 --> 00:18:11.390
But most places, like the top of
the head, there aren't muscles,

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.012
and it doesn't really hurt.

00:18:13.012 --> 00:18:14.720
But it still makes a
loud cracking noise,

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:15.890
and it's kind of
like somebody went--

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:16.390
[TAPS SKULL]

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:17.235
--like that.

00:18:17.235 --> 00:18:19.610
So you might imagine you need
a control condition, right?

00:18:19.610 --> 00:18:21.470
Because if people are--

00:18:21.470 --> 00:18:23.228
that also has a
TMS pulse, right?

00:18:23.228 --> 00:18:24.770
If you bang somebody
on the head when

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:26.478
they're trying to do
a task, you probably

00:18:26.478 --> 00:18:27.735
disrupt their performance.

00:18:27.735 --> 00:18:29.360
So you need to bang
them somewhere else

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.120
to see if it's specific
to that location.

00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:37.160
OK, so OK, so here's a little
effective on the accuracy.

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.260
It's not a huge effect size.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:45.830
So here, it's going from
85% correct to 78% correct

00:18:45.830 --> 00:18:49.580
when you zap occipital face
area compared to vertex.

00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:51.960
Everybody gets
what's going on here?

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.220
So that's good.

00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:54.620
That tells us something.

00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.720
Zapping here messes
up face perception

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.580
more than zapping here, OK?

00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:04.100
OK, so that tells us
something about causal role,

00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:06.620
but what else would
you want to know?

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:09.890
That's a beginning,
but having just learned

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.870
what I told you
about TMS, what else

00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:14.810
could you do that
would tell you more?

00:19:14.810 --> 00:19:15.460
Yeah.

00:19:15.460 --> 00:19:17.227
AUDIENCE: You see
the face [INAUDIBLE]..

00:19:17.227 --> 00:19:19.310
NANCY KANWISHER: Ah, well,
that's a good question.

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:20.300
It wasn't what I
was fishing for,

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:21.690
but it's a very good point.

00:19:21.690 --> 00:19:25.160
So this shows disruption, but
I showed you with that video

00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:27.260
before that if you
electrically stimulate the FFA,

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:28.700
you see a face.

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:31.310
Well, unfortunately,
nobody has reported

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.580
that when you zap a face area,
you see a percept of a face.

00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:37.190
Boy, that would be fun if
true, but it doesn't work.

00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.740
And there's much
debate about why.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.330
It probably has to
do with the fact

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.550
that your ability to
target just that region

00:19:43.550 --> 00:19:47.960
is less good than it is
with direct stimulation.

00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.510
There are many reports
and many published studies

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:56.450
where if you zap V1, you
see a flash of light, OK?

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.160
I don't see the
damn flash of light.

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.500
I've tried, and
tried, and tried,

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.340
and people in my lab
who I trust promised me

00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.330
they actually see it.

00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:06.500
It isn't just BS.

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.870
But I don't know;
I don't see it.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.860
Anyway, so probably,
the question

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:15.890
of when you get disruption and
when you get a positive percept

00:20:15.890 --> 00:20:18.320
is a very interesting,
complicated one.

00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.090
I think it will
ultimately have to do

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:24.110
with how those batches
of neurons not only

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:26.450
respond to faces, or
light, or whatever,

00:20:26.450 --> 00:20:28.460
but how they code
for that information,

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:34.580
such that when you put a big
artifactual, non-biological

00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.920
signal in there, will
it have any meaning

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:38.930
that the subject can interpret?

00:20:38.930 --> 00:20:40.940
I don't know if that's helpful.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.400
I think nobody really
understands that, when

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.607
you get a positive percept.

00:20:44.607 --> 00:20:46.190
But I hope you can
at least understand

00:20:46.190 --> 00:20:48.500
that at least if you mess
with it and muck it up,

00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:49.550
you can disrupt.

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.140
That logic is clear.

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:53.440
When you will be able to
actually stick in a signal

00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:55.210
and get a positive,
coherent percept

00:20:55.210 --> 00:21:00.010
is a more subtle thing, OK?

00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:01.790
OK, what else would
you want to know?

00:21:01.790 --> 00:21:02.290
Yes.

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.610
AUDIENCE: Whether it messes
up object perception, or not?

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:08.250
NANCY KANWISHER:
Absolutely, absolutely.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:10.980
All we're showing here is it's
messing up face perception.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:12.960
Maybe the guy can't see here.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.557
Maybe he's just globally blind.

00:21:14.557 --> 00:21:16.890
Maybe he'd have the same
problem with object perception,

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:18.060
absolutely.

00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:20.040
The assigned reading
for Wednesday

00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.135
shows exactly that
experiment, OK?

00:21:23.135 --> 00:21:24.510
What else would
you want to know?

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:35.320
Remember, a TMS pulse lasts
less than a millisecond.

00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:40.280
That enables us to ask a whole
interesting kind of question.

00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:41.960
What else could we find out?

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:43.060
Yeah.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:45.070
AUDIENCE: Oh, just [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.390
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, yeah.

00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.890
I'm sorry.

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.710
It's probably-- I don't mean to
be insulting your intelligence.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:50.570
You're probably sitting there
saying, this is too obvious.

00:21:50.570 --> 00:21:51.830
That's what I'm talking about.

00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:54.260
You can zap at
different times and ask,

00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:56.390
when is the information
going through there?

00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:59.240
When is that region playing
a causal role in behavior?

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:02.000
And here is a very beautiful
data that David got.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.980
And there's basically
no effect at any point

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:11.030
other than that interval between
60 and 100 milliseconds, OK?

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:12.020
So that's cool.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:14.210
Tells you that's when
that region is likely

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:15.860
engaged in processing.

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:17.540
Make sense?

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:22.910
OK, and is it Shardul?

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:24.507
Yes, already made the point.

00:22:24.507 --> 00:22:26.090
I was going to ask
you guys, does this

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:27.620
tell us this region
is specifically

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.880
involved in face perception?

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.630
Absolutely not.

00:22:29.630 --> 00:22:31.370
We'd have to test other things.

00:22:31.370 --> 00:22:34.050
It could affect
every visual percept.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.710
OK, so you can read
more about that.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.680
All right, just so to
collect all the advantages,

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.630
it gives you strong
causal evidence

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.310
that a particular
part of the brain

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:49.370
is involved in
perception or behavior.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.320
It has good temporal
information,

00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:54.890
unlike studying patients
with focal brain damage.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:57.080
And it is the only
disruption method

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.960
that can be used in
normal humans, OK?

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:03.050
So that's why, even though
it's so crude and rudimentary,

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:07.940
we use it, because it's the only
thing that fills that niche.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:09.620
A couple other
unimportant things.

00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.750
Spatial resolution isn't
as good as we'd like,

00:23:11.750 --> 00:23:15.740
but it's surprising how much
you can learn nonetheless.

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:18.140
And it doesn't reach
very far below the scalp,

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:20.060
although Ed Boyden--
the amazing Ed Boyden--

00:23:20.060 --> 00:23:24.230
is working on a crazy new
version of it that might.

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:29.670
OK, so where have all this
menagerie of methods gotten us

00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:30.170
to?

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.820
I won't go through
all this in detail.

00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:33.860
We listed all these
questions before.

00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:36.920
I gave you some of the
answers from previous methods.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:39.870
The ones we've just talked
about show, for example,

00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:42.780
that the fusiform face area--
or the occipital face area.

00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.390
In the case of TMS--

00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:47.360
are causally involved in
face perception, apparently

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:49.640
not in object
perception, pending

00:23:49.640 --> 00:23:51.962
the paper you're going to read.

00:23:51.962 --> 00:23:53.420
And so that's
important, because it

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:56.210
says when we try to
come up with theories

00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:58.003
of how face
recognition works, we

00:23:58.003 --> 00:24:00.170
might think about having a
different theory for face

00:24:00.170 --> 00:24:04.250
recognition from our theory
of object recognition.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:08.390
OK, so this is all
magnificent and wonderful,

00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.670
but I finessed this list of
questions so that the methods

00:24:13.670 --> 00:24:16.700
would be able to address
them-- at least a little bit--

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.510
and I sneakily left off a
whole suite of other questions

00:24:20.510 --> 00:24:22.940
that are extremely
important-- arguably more

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.420
important-- that those
methods don't address, OK?

00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.900
So we want to know not just
that a region responds to faces.

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:32.060
We want to know exactly
what is represented

00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:35.600
in that region or other regions
that respond to other things.

00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:37.775
We want to know, what is
the neural code for faces?

00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:43.730
We want to know, what are the
actual computations that go on

00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:46.530
in a given region, how
do they unfold over time,

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:48.830
and how do those
computations produce

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:51.050
the representations and
behavioral abilities

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.360
that we measure?

00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:56.293
We want to know, what are the
actual anatomical connections?

00:24:56.293 --> 00:24:57.710
I showed you that
little occipital

00:24:57.710 --> 00:25:01.760
face area right nearby but
discontiguous from the fusiform

00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.840
face area.

00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:05.990
I've wanted to know for 20 years
whether those damn things are

00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:07.910
connected anatomically.

00:25:07.910 --> 00:25:12.320
Shockingly, we still
don't know that.

00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.127
We want to know what
is the causal role

00:25:14.127 --> 00:25:15.335
of each region in perception.

00:25:15.335 --> 00:25:17.900
And I showed you a few ways that
we get little bits of data--

00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.760
kind of, sort of-- but there's
a lot of cases where we don't.

00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:25.280
And we want to know, how does
all this stuff get wired up

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.320
over development, right?

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.880
What is the role of experience?

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:31.580
Do you need to see faces to
wire up the phase region,

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:35.910
or is it there at birth
before you ever see a face?

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:38.580
The sad truth is,
for the most part,

00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:40.440
we don't have good
methods to answer

00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.530
these questions in humans.

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.710
So that's just a big
bummer, but it's true.

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.600
Most of these
questions can only be

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.810
answered by research in
animals, or can be best answered

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:54.750
by research in animals.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.550
So I'm going to take
a moment to talk

00:25:56.550 --> 00:25:58.770
about ethical issues
in animal research,

00:25:58.770 --> 00:26:02.850
just to note that I
think there is an issue.

00:26:02.850 --> 00:26:04.890
And I'll say that
it's not unreasonable

00:26:04.890 --> 00:26:05.730
if you have qualms.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:07.320
I noticed in an
earlier lecture, I

00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.145
started talking about
recording from animal brains,

00:26:10.145 --> 00:26:12.270
and I didn't have time at
that moment to mark this,

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.800
but I do think it's important.

00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.863
If it makes you uneasy,
that's totally legitimate.

00:26:16.863 --> 00:26:18.780
You should think about
that, and respect that,

00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:20.880
and think hard about
whether that's--

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.070
what you make of that.

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:26.250
Unambiguously, causing
animals pointless suffering

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.660
is just completely
unacceptable, OK?

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.360
So I think we can
all agree on that.

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:33.900
And I think there's a
very difficult trade-off

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:38.250
between avoiding suffering
in animals and research

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.960
that has saved countless lives.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.150
So people can
legitimately come down

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:45.930
on different sides of this, but
many lives have been saved--

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:48.330
including mine-- based
on animal research

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:52.380
that enabled treatments
that were life-saving.

00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:55.380
And a few things to
think about to help you

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.860
inform how you handle
that trade-off.

00:26:58.860 --> 00:27:01.740
First of all, know that animal
research in the United States

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:04.650
is very heavily regulated, OK?

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.060
So animals receive
excellent vet care--

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.830
shockingly, better
than probably lots

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.040
of citizens of this country.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.270
That's another topic.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:20.130
Also, there's a very major
emphasis on avoiding pain.

00:27:20.130 --> 00:27:22.320
So I think it's
probably generally true

00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.710
that it's infrequent that lab
animals suffer a lot of pain.

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:29.260
Researchers and vets are
very careful to avoid that.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.290
So the bigger issue
is not so much

00:27:31.290 --> 00:27:34.350
are the animals physically
suffering from pain, per se,

00:27:34.350 --> 00:27:36.840
but what kind of life
is it to live in a lab

00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:38.370
and be a lab animal?

00:27:38.370 --> 00:27:41.730
And I think that's a
legitimate question.

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:45.120
For monkeys, at least, where
I, at least-- and maybe

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.570
in my speciesist bias, being
more sympathetic to similar

00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:49.530
species.

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:54.180
I don't know if that's
legitimate, but it's a natural.

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.020
There are increasing efforts
to improve the quality of life

00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.180
for monkeys in labs.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:03.210
Many monkeys are now
housed in social groups

00:28:03.210 --> 00:28:05.640
where they can hang out
with their families,

00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.000
and that certainly improves
their quality of life.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.780
Many monkeys basically
play video games all day.

00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.987
In DiCarlo Lab, they're
studying visual perception,

00:28:14.987 --> 00:28:15.820
and what do they do?

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.720
They get the monkeys in there
basically doing visual tasks

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.240
in exchange for juice rewards.

00:28:21.240 --> 00:28:22.830
Not all that
different from what,

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.920
probably, lots of you guys do.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.500
Now, maybe they'd be
happier in nature.

00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.050
Probably, much of the time,
they'd be happier in nature.

00:28:31.050 --> 00:28:32.640
But I think that's
complicated, too.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.450
Nature can be pretty nasty.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:39.450
So it's not totally obvious that
quality of life in a random lab

00:28:39.450 --> 00:28:43.200
is worse than quality
of life in nature.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.080
The third point, I'd say, is
that the benefits of research

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:46.920
are forever.

00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:49.350
You discover something
major about how brains work,

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.543
that's forever, right?

00:28:50.543 --> 00:28:51.960
So you've got to
amortize whatever

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:54.780
cost of animal suffering there
is against the forever-ness

00:28:54.780 --> 00:28:57.540
of that insight.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.160
And so in my view--

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:00.340
not that you need to agree--

00:29:00.340 --> 00:29:04.200
but in my view, animal research
is vastly more justifiable

00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.300
than things like
eating meat or buying

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:10.620
leather, which is just transient
entertainment or convenience,

00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:12.180
right?

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.607
So anyway, you guys,
I encourage you all

00:29:14.607 --> 00:29:17.190
to think hard about this and to
come to different conclusions.

00:29:17.190 --> 00:29:21.840
I just wanted to note that
these are issues that are worth

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.990
thinking about.

00:29:24.990 --> 00:29:29.490
That said, the methods in animal
research are breathtaking,

00:29:29.490 --> 00:29:32.580
and they get more and more
breathtaking every day.

00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:34.500
In this building,
people are constantly

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.140
inventing astonishing
new ways to answer

00:29:37.140 --> 00:29:38.200
all kinds of questions.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:40.033
And I wanted to give
you just a gist of some

00:29:40.033 --> 00:29:41.970
of the kind of
stuff that you can

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.400
do to answer that
list of questions

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.420
that I said we can't
really answer in humans.

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.428
So just very briefly--

00:29:47.428 --> 00:29:49.470
this used to be a whole
lecture, but I've decided

00:29:49.470 --> 00:29:50.760
to cut it to one slide--

00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.570
very briefly, about
10-plus years ago,

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.810
these two amazing people, Doris
Tsao and Winrich Freiwald--

00:29:57.810 --> 00:30:00.990
who, mark my words, will
get a Nobel Prize someday,

00:30:00.990 --> 00:30:04.800
or at least they
should, and they might--

00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:07.200
they popped a monkey
in the scanner

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:10.560
and did the very same experiment
that we do on humans, OK?

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.160
So here's a monkey brain.

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.630
Again, the cortex is unfolded so
you can see the whole surface.

00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:18.450
The dark bits are the bits
that used to be inside a fold.

00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:20.430
The little yellow
patches are the patches

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:22.950
that respond more to
faces than objects--

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.450
just analogous to
the FFA in humans,

00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:28.080
but there are six little
patches in monkeys.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.992
OK, so that's so far,
that's like, OK, fine,

00:30:30.992 --> 00:30:31.950
monkeys have them, too.

00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:33.240
That's cool.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.570
But the thing is,
because that's a monkey,

00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:39.590
you can then stick electrodes
straight into that region

00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:42.170
right there, and you
can record from hundreds

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:43.370
of neurons in that region.

00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:45.140
And you can record
the response of each

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:47.450
of those hundreds of neurons
to hundreds or thousands

00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:48.350
of stimuli.

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.300
You can characterize
the neural code

00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.770
for faces in monkeys in a way
that you just can't for humans.

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:57.320
In fact, Doris now
published a paper last year

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.850
called "The Neural
Code for Faces,"

00:30:58.850 --> 00:31:00.680
based on a decade
of this research.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.660
It's quite breathtaking.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:08.090
OK, second, you can watch
those representations change,

00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:10.980
those neural population
codes change over time.

00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:15.140
You can see, at one time
point, what the code seems

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.840
to be saying here, and
then here, and then here,

00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:19.340
and you can watch that--

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:21.673
those codes-- change over
time in each of those regions.

00:31:21.673 --> 00:31:23.382
And you can see
different representations

00:31:23.382 --> 00:31:24.530
in each of those regions.

00:31:24.530 --> 00:31:27.398
It's quite breathtaking.

00:31:27.398 --> 00:31:28.940
You can answer this
question of, what

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.215
are the anatomical connections
between these regions,

00:31:31.215 --> 00:31:32.840
with a whole bunch
of different methods

00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:34.048
that I won't go through here.

00:31:34.048 --> 00:31:37.585
But you can actually answer
what's connected to what.

00:31:37.585 --> 00:31:38.960
And what these
guys have found is

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:41.090
that all of those
yellow face patches

00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:43.640
are connected to each other
by long-range connections that

00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.030
go through the white matter
underneath the gray matter.

00:31:47.030 --> 00:31:49.790
Those regions are
not connected at all

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.980
to the intervening
other patches of cortex.

00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.490
So that set of
six little regions

00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:59.270
is like a computational
unit with different hubs

00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:02.480
that talk to each other.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.730
And you can see all
that in monkeys in a way

00:32:04.730 --> 00:32:08.270
that we still don't
know in humans.

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:11.390
You can electrically stimulate,
or disrupt with other methods,

00:32:11.390 --> 00:32:13.790
any one of those
patches one at a time.

00:32:13.790 --> 00:32:16.280
You can disrupt them
for 50 milliseconds

00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:20.810
here, 200 milliseconds
there, whatever you like.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.960
And you can study this whole
system over development.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.300
How does it change from
shortly after birth

00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:29.210
to monkey adolescence?

00:32:29.210 --> 00:32:32.270
And you can control
experience during development.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:33.710
You can raise
monkeys without ever

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:36.320
letting them see faces, and
ask whether seeing a face

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:38.390
is necessary for the
development of that region.

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:40.400
We'll talk about that
in a few lectures.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.250
My point is just that
with animal research

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:47.000
you can answer vastly
richer, more sophisticated

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.080
questions than you could
ever answer in humans,

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:50.120
and that's just life.

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.140
Yes, what's your name?

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:51.860
AUDIENCE: I'm Esther.

00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:52.560
NANCY KANWISHER: Esther, hi.

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.080
AUDIENCE: So in
these experiments,

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:55.860
they showed them
monkey faces, right?

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:56.520
Not humans?

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:58.228
NANCY KANWISHER: Done
all different ways.

00:32:58.228 --> 00:33:00.110
Remember, monkeys
see other monkeys,

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:01.730
but they see a lot
of humans, too.

00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:04.580
And monkey face patches respond
pretty similarly to human

00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.410
faces and monkey faces.

00:33:06.410 --> 00:33:09.020
Human faces respond pretty
similarly to human faces

00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:10.220
and monkey faces, too--

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.440
even if you don't
work in a monkey lab.

00:33:15.230 --> 00:33:18.080
OK, so just to say that there
are loads of other methods,

00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.050
and we'll get these
later in the course.

00:33:21.050 --> 00:33:27.440
OK, so that snake assignment,
I hope that seemed--

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.840
I thought you guys, for the
most part, did very well

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.927
and did exactly the kind of
things that we had in mind.

00:33:33.927 --> 00:33:36.260
And I just want to go through
a few bits of terminology,

00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:38.990
because I realized, some of
you who messed up the wording,

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:42.080
I hadn't really fully explained
what the different words mean.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.960
OK, so first of all, there's
this incredibly boring words

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:47.270
of independent variables
and dependent variables.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:49.370
And frankly, I
didn't know which was

00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:52.850
which until I started teaching
this stuff a few years ago.

00:33:52.850 --> 00:33:54.980
But the concept is
really important.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:58.760
An independent variable,
that's a factor that you,

00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.850
the experimentalist,
manipulate and change,

00:34:01.850 --> 00:34:04.610
so that you can then
measure what effect it

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:07.610
has on a brain or behavior.

00:34:07.610 --> 00:34:10.732
The effect you measure is
the dependent variable.

00:34:10.732 --> 00:34:13.190
The independent variable is
called the independent variable

00:34:13.190 --> 00:34:14.600
because you, the
experimentalist,

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.270
get to mess with it, get
to manipulate it, OK?

00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:19.639
The dependent one, you're
measuring its dependence

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:21.350
on the independent one.

00:34:21.350 --> 00:34:23.540
So just basically,
in the experiment,

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.820
you muck with
something in the world,

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:27.320
and you measure
the consequences.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:29.929
The thing you muck with is
the independent variable.

00:34:29.929 --> 00:34:32.750
The muckee, the thing you
measure the effect on,

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:34.460
is the dependent variable.

00:34:34.460 --> 00:34:35.489
Make sense?

00:34:35.489 --> 00:34:35.989
OK.

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.762
All right, so for example,
the bold response,

00:34:40.762 --> 00:34:43.429
that's a dependent variable, and
pretty much all the experiments

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:45.409
we'll talk about here.

00:34:45.409 --> 00:34:47.870
All right, the hypothesis,
most of you got that.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:50.943
The hypothesis is the
statement about the world

00:34:50.943 --> 00:34:52.610
that you're trying
to figure out if it's

00:34:52.610 --> 00:34:56.840
true in your experiment, OK?

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:59.240
A prediction-- most of you
got this, but let me just say,

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.340
a prediction is supposed
to be extremely precise.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.380
It's the exact
statement of what you

00:35:03.380 --> 00:35:06.420
will see when you measure
your dependent variable

00:35:06.420 --> 00:35:08.083
if the hypothesis is true.

00:35:08.083 --> 00:35:09.500
What is the crucial
thing you have

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:12.350
to look for in the data
you measure that tells you

00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:13.895
if the hypothesis
is true or not?

00:35:13.895 --> 00:35:16.160
And the prediction
is what you will find

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:20.750
if the hypothesis is true, OK?

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.700
Confound-- we haven't
talked about this yet.

00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.360
A confound is a difference
between your conditions

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.180
that you're manipulating
other than the one you

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.600
intend to manipulate.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:36.230
And hence, confounds give
you alternative accounts.

00:35:36.230 --> 00:35:38.690
Case in point, we
compare the response

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:42.260
in the brain when people look
at faces versus when they look

00:35:42.260 --> 00:35:44.810
at a bunch of random objects.

00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:47.450
The fact that the faces
have more curvy surfaces,

00:35:47.450 --> 00:35:50.840
or are animate, or
are more interesting,

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:54.440
those are all confounds with
respect to the hypothesis

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.650
that that region is responding
specifically to faces.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:59.150
Everybody got that?

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:02.510
OK, it's very common,
amid undergraduates,

00:36:02.510 --> 00:36:05.780
to use confound to mean anything
bad about an experiment.

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:06.710
That's not right.

00:36:06.710 --> 00:36:09.050
A confound is a very
particular thing.

00:36:09.050 --> 00:36:11.780
It's another dimension that
co-varies with the thing

00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.090
that you care about.

00:36:14.090 --> 00:36:15.650
It's like a nuisance
variable that's

00:36:15.650 --> 00:36:17.930
correlated with the thing
you're manipulating,

00:36:17.930 --> 00:36:22.520
and hence is giving you
a difficulty inferring

00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:27.180
a clean inference
from your data.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:30.270
All right, a contrast.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:32.220
We talked about
activations in the brain,

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:34.637
like those little yellow patches
I showed in monkey brains

00:36:34.637 --> 00:36:35.280
a moment ago.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:38.790
That shows you the bits
that responded more

00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:40.620
in functional MRI
when that monkey was

00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:42.540
looking at faces than objects.

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:46.010
The contrast is faces
versus objects, right?

00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:48.240
It's looking for
a higher response

00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.980
in one condition than another.

00:36:49.980 --> 00:36:50.550
Make sense?

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:52.110
OK, these should
all be fairly clear.

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:55.050
I just know that not
everybody got this.

00:36:55.050 --> 00:37:01.000
OK, now, the point of a contrast
is to isolate a mental process,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.500
OK?

00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:05.140
So let's talk about
that for a second.

00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:08.760
So how do we decide
what contrasts to use?

00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.740
OK, well, first
thing you have to do

00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:12.420
is get clear about
your hypothesis.

00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:13.590
State it explicitly.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.590
Most of you guys did
that really well.

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:19.230
Often, your hypothesis-- with
functional MRI, at least--

00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:23.520
will concern a particular mental
process that you're studying--

00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.890
like face recognition.

00:37:25.890 --> 00:37:27.720
Now, remember,
importantly-- I said

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.340
this briefly way
back-- functional

00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.100
MRI can only tell
you about differences

00:37:32.100 --> 00:37:34.110
between two conditions.

00:37:34.110 --> 00:37:36.750
The absolute number, you're
going to measure the MR signal

00:37:36.750 --> 00:37:38.850
intensity in one
condition-- say,

00:37:38.850 --> 00:37:40.320
when people are
looking at faces--

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:44.040
and it's going to be
something like 726.

00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:46.260
And it's totally meaningless.

00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:49.020
That's just how strong the
MRI signal is from that point.

00:37:49.020 --> 00:37:52.080
It doesn't mean a
damn thing on its own.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.860
But then, if we also measure,
in that same part of the brain,

00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.010
the MR signal intensity when the
subject is looking at objects,

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:04.620
and it's 720, then now
we're in business, OK?

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:07.270
All right, so everything
is a difference.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:09.450
So that means that in
any imaging experiment,

00:38:09.450 --> 00:38:12.840
you'll need to compare
two or more conditions.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.170
One condition will
never get you anything.

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.750
And if you want to isolate
a particular mental process,

00:38:18.750 --> 00:38:22.770
you need to turn that
mental process on or off,

00:38:22.770 --> 00:38:25.715
or you need to vary how
strongly it's turned on.

00:38:25.715 --> 00:38:27.090
So this is all in
the service of,

00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:29.090
how are we going to decide
what contrast to use?

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:32.430
That's our goal, is to turn
on or off one little thing.

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:35.800
OK, and here's the problem.

00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.240
If I told you, OK,
look at my face,

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:43.890
and don't process low-level
visual information,

00:38:43.890 --> 00:38:45.540
and don't think about
what I'm saying.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.520
Just see my face.

00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:48.270
It's like, what?

00:38:48.270 --> 00:38:49.830
You can't do that, right?

00:38:49.830 --> 00:38:51.210
There's a whole
processing chain.

00:38:51.210 --> 00:38:55.320
You can't just do one little
mental process at a time.

00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.110
And so that means
we can't just have

00:38:58.110 --> 00:39:00.600
a task where you do
only mental process x,

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.060
and a task where you
don't do mental process x,

00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:06.150
If you're not doing other stuff.

00:39:06.150 --> 00:39:10.650
So what that means is we need to
choose two tasks, each of which

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:14.400
has lots of mental processes,
but that differ in only one.

00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:19.530
And then, we can
compare those two.

00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.680
So this is called
subtraction logic,

00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:24.780
and it comes from
work over 100 years

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.250
ago in cognitive
psychology and people

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:28.830
who were just
measuring behavior.

00:39:28.830 --> 00:39:31.740
This dude, Donders, he's
a Dutch physiologist,

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:35.670
and he invented the subtraction
method to measure reaction

00:39:35.670 --> 00:39:38.400
times in humans, way back.

00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:41.170
And so with functional MRI,
we're doing the same thing.

00:39:41.170 --> 00:39:44.070
So we're going to come up
with two different tasks which

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.310
involve the whole suite, from
input, to mental processing,

00:39:47.310 --> 00:39:49.140
to output.

00:39:49.140 --> 00:39:51.630
And yet, we're going to try
to make them differ in just

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:53.520
one particular mental process.

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.930
Everybody with the program here?

00:39:54.930 --> 00:40:00.870
OK, all right, so what you
aspire toward in the contrasts

00:40:00.870 --> 00:40:04.470
that you choose is something
called a minimal pair, right?

00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:07.290
So the idea is we're going
to have these two tasks that

00:40:07.290 --> 00:40:10.860
are identical in every respect,
except for that one thing

00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:12.000
we care about, OK?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.170
So here's a task,
and here's a task.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:16.350
This one involves
snake perception,

00:40:16.350 --> 00:40:18.640
and this one is
identical to this one,

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:22.310
except for snake perception.

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:23.720
That's what we want.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.260
OK, and if you get
those two things, that's

00:40:27.260 --> 00:40:29.030
called a minimal pair.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:30.890
And this is the single
most important thing

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.150
in experimental design.

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.530
All the other stuff--

00:40:33.530 --> 00:40:36.260
like how you arrange
your stimuli over time

00:40:36.260 --> 00:40:37.650
and all that kind of stuff--

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:40.317
OK, it matters a little bit, but
this is the crux of the matter.

00:40:40.317 --> 00:40:41.960
What are those
conditions, and are they

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.030
the right kind of minimal pair?

00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:47.450
And you guys got the gist,
but I felt like most of you

00:40:47.450 --> 00:40:49.470
didn't really engage.

00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:52.068
OK, what exactly were
those non-snake conditions?

00:40:52.068 --> 00:40:53.735
So that's really the
crux of the matter.

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:59.870
So the most common problem
with imaging experiments

00:40:59.870 --> 00:41:02.930
is not that the scanner wasn't
as fancy as it could have been,

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:05.790
or they didn't use the latest
cutting-edge analysis method.

00:41:05.790 --> 00:41:08.570
The most common problem is
that people's contrasts--

00:41:08.570 --> 00:41:10.070
their conditions--
were not designed

00:41:10.070 --> 00:41:13.550
beautifully enough to isolate
a single mental process, OK?

00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:19.160
That is that the conditions
were not minimal pairs.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.500
Any other difference
between the two conditions

00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:23.735
other than the one you
intend is a confound.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:28.970
All right, so let's
engage on this.

00:41:28.970 --> 00:41:32.540
Now, if we ran a
whole experiment only

00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:36.690
on male subjects,
is that a confound?

00:41:36.690 --> 00:41:37.740
No.

00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:39.448
Why not, Isabelle?

00:41:39.448 --> 00:41:41.740
AUDIENCE: Because it's not
a difference between the two

00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.940
experimental conditions.

00:41:42.940 --> 00:41:45.190
NANCY KANWISHER: Yeah, it's
just a bad design feature,

00:41:45.190 --> 00:41:47.620
or something that limits your
ability to draw inferences.

00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:52.230
Again, sub-optimal design it's
not the same as a confound.

00:41:52.230 --> 00:41:54.280
A confound is this
very particular thing.

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.630
OK, if all the snake pictures
have grassy backgrounds,

00:41:58.630 --> 00:42:03.520
and all the non-snake conditions
do not, is that a confound?

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.000
Yeah, exactly a confound, right.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.360
OK, so I just said all this,
so I'll stop boring you.

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:13.570
OK, and the reason that
the grassy background

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:16.222
thing is a confound is it gives
you an alternative account

00:42:16.222 --> 00:42:16.930
of that contrast.

00:42:16.930 --> 00:42:18.550
Maybe it's grassiness,
not snake-ness,

00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:20.110
that's the key difference.

00:42:20.110 --> 00:42:21.100
You don't know.

00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:23.560
OK, all right.

00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:26.140
OK, so all of that
said, minimum pairs

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:29.290
are like a platonic ideal
of experimental design.

00:42:29.290 --> 00:42:33.100
What you aspire toward, but
you can never really do it.

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.300
If the two conditions were
identical except for this one

00:42:37.300 --> 00:42:39.250
little thing,
they'd be identical.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.320
You can never
totally pull it off,

00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.110
but you can track the little
ways in which you fail,

00:42:44.110 --> 00:42:48.930
and you can test them one at a
time in later experiments, OK?

00:42:48.930 --> 00:42:50.667
All right, good.

00:42:50.667 --> 00:42:52.500
All right, so here's
what we're going to do.

00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:53.910
We're going to
break into groups,

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.535
and you guys are going to think
how to take the kind of designs

00:42:56.535 --> 00:42:58.590
that you already put
together and turn them

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:02.885
into actual experiments-- which
is going to require deciding

00:43:02.885 --> 00:43:04.260
on a whole bunch
of other things,

00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:06.760
and then we're going to discuss
the things you come up with.

00:43:06.760 --> 00:43:08.730
OK, what are the
exact conditions

00:43:08.730 --> 00:43:10.210
you'll run in your experiment?

00:43:10.210 --> 00:43:13.230
So we could spend a whole
class talking about this.

00:43:13.230 --> 00:43:15.180
So I'd love to
hear your best-ofs,

00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:18.210
but I don't want to engage
on that for a whole class.

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.680
A lot of the keys,
some of you guys

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.220
had very clever
non-snake conditions

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:26.310
to test to get close
to minimal pairs.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:28.260
I want to hear about those.

00:43:28.260 --> 00:43:30.060
But then, beyond
that, here's something

00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.220
that probably none
of you mentioned.

00:43:32.220 --> 00:43:34.620
It's understandable; I don't
think I said much about it.

00:43:34.620 --> 00:43:37.680
What are subjects
doing in the scanner?

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:40.020
Are they just lying there,
and the stimuli are just

00:43:40.020 --> 00:43:42.530
flashing up, and they're
going dumdy-dumdy-dum?

00:43:42.530 --> 00:43:44.280
Are they doing something
with the stimuli?

00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.040
Go think about what you would
want to have happen, OK?

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:49.680
So what is the task?

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.920
Third, some of you mentioned
baseline conditions

00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.960
but didn't really
say what they are.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.640
What would a baseline
condition be?

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.820
And do you want them, or
is it a waste of scan time?

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.810
Think about that.

00:44:03.450 --> 00:44:05.790
OK, next, suppose
you get to scan

00:44:05.790 --> 00:44:08.580
10 subjects for one hour each.

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.940
Now, think about how that
design is actually going to go.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.040
Are you going to assign
different conditions

00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:16.770
to different subjects--
so these five people will

00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:19.110
see all the snake images,
and these five people will

00:44:19.110 --> 00:44:21.532
see all the non-snake images?

00:44:21.532 --> 00:44:23.490
Or, are you going to have
snakes and non-snakes

00:44:23.490 --> 00:44:26.520
within each subject?

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:33.090
Next, it's nice to not make
the subject do their task

00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:34.097
non-stop for an hour.

00:44:34.097 --> 00:44:35.430
We usually give subjects breaks.

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.660
So we break an experiment into
pieces of 3 to 10 minutes--

00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:41.700
or whatever I wrote, yeah.

00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:43.710
And so those are called runs.

00:44:43.710 --> 00:44:46.470
So think about how
you want to allocate

00:44:46.470 --> 00:44:48.120
those conditions to runs.

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.543
And how many runs
will you include?

00:44:53.543 --> 00:44:54.960
And then, think
about what's going

00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.163
to happen within each run.

00:44:56.163 --> 00:44:58.080
So if you're going to
have multiple conditions

00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:01.148
within a run, are you going
to stick all of the snake

00:45:01.148 --> 00:45:03.690
conditions in the first half
and all the non-snake conditions

00:45:03.690 --> 00:45:04.710
in the second half?

00:45:04.710 --> 00:45:08.080
If not, why not?

00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.133
And if there are multiple
conditions within a run,

00:45:11.133 --> 00:45:13.050
yeah, are you going to
clump them all together

00:45:13.050 --> 00:45:19.050
or interleave them randomly, and
what are the trade-offs there?

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:24.750
And, what is the order of
conditions within a run?

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:27.150
And we won't get to
number 10 for the moment.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:30.998
OK, so we're going to break
you guys into four groups,

00:45:30.998 --> 00:45:32.790
and you're going to
talk amongst yourselves

00:45:32.790 --> 00:45:34.498
and try to come up
with your best answers

00:45:34.498 --> 00:45:37.988
to these in five, 10,
minutes, something like that.

00:45:37.988 --> 00:45:39.780
And then, we're going
to pull your thoughts

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:43.590
on this when we get back, OK?

00:45:43.590 --> 00:45:46.950
OK, so part of my
agenda in doing this

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.960
is just to break up the
monotony of me going blah,

00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:53.080
blah, blah, because experimental
design is like, it's important,

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.910
but it's not the
most riveting thing.

00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:57.750
The other thing is,
experimental design is basically

00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:59.440
just organized common sense.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:00.997
And so most of this
stuff, you guys

00:46:00.997 --> 00:46:02.580
just answered all
these questions just

00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:03.580
by thinking about them.

00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:06.000
You need to know a few
things about the methods,

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.448
but really, in experimental
design, the biggest, the best

00:46:10.448 --> 00:46:12.990
guideline, the best way to think
about design is think about,

00:46:12.990 --> 00:46:14.040
OK you're the subject.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.207
You're lying in the scanner.

00:46:15.207 --> 00:46:16.560
You're doing that.

00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.425
Does that work?

00:46:17.425 --> 00:46:19.050
Are you actually
going to be doing what

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:20.217
you're supposed to be doing?

00:46:20.217 --> 00:46:23.393
Are you going to be selectively
turning on and off this one

00:46:23.393 --> 00:46:24.935
little mental process
you care about,

00:46:24.935 --> 00:46:26.602
or are you doing a
million other things,

00:46:26.602 --> 00:46:29.738
like falling asleep, and
getting bored, and all of that,

00:46:29.738 --> 00:46:31.530
and predicting what's
going to happen next,

00:46:31.530 --> 00:46:32.880
and all that kind of stuff?

00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:36.990
OK, all right, so let's
just take a few examples.

00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.660
What were some good kinds
of control conditions-- that

00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:47.970
is, non-snake stimuli that are
good to compare to snakes that

00:46:47.970 --> 00:46:49.980
maybe aren't perfect
minimal pairs,

00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.050
but that get partway there?

00:46:52.050 --> 00:46:54.990
I saw a few, just in the
few papers that I looked at.

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:56.542
Yeah, I've got a--

00:46:56.542 --> 00:46:58.500
I'm sorry, I've asked
your name like six times.

00:46:58.500 --> 00:46:59.250
But I'm going to--

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:01.470
on my trusty sheet, tell
me again how you say it?

00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.940
AUDIENCE: Achay.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:02.898
NANCY KANWISHER: Achay.

00:47:02.898 --> 00:47:03.810
OK.

00:47:03.810 --> 00:47:07.097
AUDIENCE: So for ours, we
compared snakes to worms.

00:47:07.097 --> 00:47:08.430
NANCY KANWISHER: To worms, yeah.

00:47:08.430 --> 00:47:10.800
AUDIENCE: Because they
have really similar shapes.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.560
NANCY KANWISHER: Awesome,
and they're both animate.

00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:15.690
That's great, love it.

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:17.010
What else?

00:47:17.010 --> 00:47:19.306
Who else had a good
control condition?

00:47:22.778 --> 00:47:25.500
Or who had an interest
in control condition?

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:27.972
Yes, sorry, your name is--

00:47:27.972 --> 00:47:28.680
AUDIENCE: Lauren.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.330
NANCY KANWISHER: Yes, OK.

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.000
AUDIENCE: Yep, our group had
pretty much the same baseline

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.130
background, and we
would just superimpose

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:38.620
images of different objects on
it so that remained consistent

00:47:38.620 --> 00:47:39.120
throughout.

00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.920
NANCY KANWISHER: Uh-huh, and
the background was like what?

00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:41.878
AUDIENCE: Forest floor.

00:47:41.913 --> 00:47:43.080
NANCY KANWISHER: Uh-huh, OK.

00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.930
So you stick a toaster
on the forest floor

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:48.360
or something like that, versus
a snake or something, yeah?

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:51.120
AUDIENCE: The idea was
more like other animals,

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.212
or stuff that would
make more sense.

00:47:53.212 --> 00:47:54.420
NANCY KANWISHER: That's good.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:56.880
That deals with the grass
confound problem, right?

00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:58.230
Absolutely, very good.

00:47:58.230 --> 00:48:00.360
What else?

00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:02.090
David, you had
interesting ideas.

00:48:02.090 --> 00:48:05.160
AUDIENCE: Well, we
were talking a lot

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.300
about animate versus
inanimate things,

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.020
so like comparing
to a garden hose.

00:48:09.020 --> 00:48:10.560
NANCY KANWISHER:
Yes, garden hose!

00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:11.370
Love it!

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.600
I actually ran this experiment
a bunch of years ago,

00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:15.270
and we used a garden hose--

00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:17.768
or a bunch of garden hoses,
coiled up in the grass.

00:48:17.768 --> 00:48:19.560
We tried to make them
slither and all that.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:21.940
Anyway, but garden
hose is great.

00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:22.440
Say more.

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.480
You had other good
ideas in your--

00:48:24.480 --> 00:48:27.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we also-- we
talked about some of my ideas

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.378
were looking at
videos, with motion.

00:48:31.378 --> 00:48:32.253
NANCY KANWISHER: Why?

00:48:32.253 --> 00:48:33.000
AUDIENCE: What'd you say?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:33.875
NANCY KANWISHER: Why?

00:48:33.875 --> 00:48:38.950
AUDIENCE: Oh, because
when you get a snake,

00:48:38.950 --> 00:48:41.800
it kind of slithers and has
this very distinctive thing,

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:44.320
that it feels like the
motion is what creeps me

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.490
out when I see a snake.

00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:46.540
NANCY KANWISHER: Totally.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:47.170
Me, too.

00:48:47.170 --> 00:48:49.630
AUDIENCE: And if you
have a rigid thing that

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:53.560
looked like a snake, but it
was just sliding rigidly,

00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.338
then it wouldn't
really creep me out.

00:48:55.338 --> 00:48:56.380
NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.

00:48:56.380 --> 00:48:57.940
This is a key insight, right?

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.120
So think about if we're
interested in how you perceive

00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:04.180
snakes, we want to know not just
how you do it in some weird lab

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:04.700
environment.

00:49:04.700 --> 00:49:06.070
We want to know how
you'd actually do that.

00:49:06.070 --> 00:49:07.690
The whole reason
to choose snakes

00:49:07.690 --> 00:49:10.360
is it seems like something that
could be biologically relevant.

00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:12.730
There might be special hardware.

00:49:12.730 --> 00:49:15.410
When I'm out hiking and I
see even a curved stick,

00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:17.967
I, like, jump and shriek
before I can censor myself.

00:49:17.967 --> 00:49:18.550
It's horrible.

00:49:18.550 --> 00:49:19.660
I find it very embarrassing.

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.285
It's not consistent
with my self-image.

00:49:21.285 --> 00:49:23.810
But I have no control
over it; it just happens.

00:49:23.810 --> 00:49:25.310
And so I've thought
for a long time,

00:49:25.310 --> 00:49:27.768
there's some damn bit of my
brain that's making me do that,

00:49:27.768 --> 00:49:29.830
and it pisses me off,
and I'm going to find it.

00:49:29.830 --> 00:49:31.288
Well, we looked
and didn't find it.

00:49:31.288 --> 00:49:34.600
But anyway, you go
from those intuitions.

00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:37.037
Often, your own introspections
are very informative,

00:49:37.037 --> 00:49:38.870
and I think your intuition
is exactly right.

00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:41.920
There's a very characteristic
motion that snakes have,

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.690
and it could be
that that's the cue.

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:46.975
So then, the trick is you have
slithery motion versus what?

00:49:49.628 --> 00:49:50.170
I don't know.

00:49:50.170 --> 00:49:50.670
That's hard.

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:53.170
What other kinds of
motions could you have?

00:49:53.170 --> 00:49:56.200
AUDIENCE: Right, so you could
have just even rigid motion,

00:49:56.200 --> 00:50:01.320
where it's not slithering,
or it's not changing shape.

00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:03.192
It's just sliding or rotating.

00:50:03.192 --> 00:50:04.150
NANCY KANWISHER: Right.

00:50:04.150 --> 00:50:05.320
Right, exactly.

00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.570
Anyway, all those
are all good ideas.

00:50:07.570 --> 00:50:12.850
Good, so what should the
subject do in the scanner?

00:50:12.850 --> 00:50:15.760
Should they lie there
and go dumdy-dumdy-dum?

00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.150
Should they do a task?

00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:18.085
If so, what task?

00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.580
Oh, if you guys
don't volunteer, I'm

00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:26.860
going to start
calling on people--

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.020
even though, as
the Jenkins study,

00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.170
showed it's nearly impossible to
look at these damn photographs

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:35.290
and figure out who's who.

00:50:35.290 --> 00:50:37.737
David, in the back.

00:50:37.737 --> 00:50:38.320
AUDIENCE: So--

00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:38.890
NANCY KANWISHER: Task.

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:39.800
Task, or no task?

00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:40.300
What task?

00:50:40.300 --> 00:50:44.920
AUDIENCE: Yes, we talked about
having the subjects find a way

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:49.270
to indicate that they're paying
attention and not just dozing

00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:49.900
off.

00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:50.858
NANCY KANWISHER: Right.

00:50:50.858 --> 00:50:56.110
AUDIENCE: So one idea was to
have them essentially indicate

00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:59.080
the source, make [INAUDIBLE]
think about a bunch of problems

00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:01.610
like, well, we don't want
them thinking about snakes

00:51:01.610 --> 00:51:02.860
for the entire our experiment.

00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.070
So--

00:51:04.070 --> 00:51:05.150
NANCY KANWISHER: Also, if
they're going to tell you

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:07.370
they're seeing a snake,
maybe by pushing a button,

00:51:07.370 --> 00:51:09.495
then on the snake trails,
they're pushing a button,

00:51:09.495 --> 00:51:11.203
and on the non-snake
trials, they're not.

00:51:11.203 --> 00:51:12.870
AUDIENCE: Well, on
the non-snake trials,

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:14.330
they would push another button.

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:15.950
NANCY KANWISHER: Ah, but then
they have two different motor

00:51:15.950 --> 00:51:16.450
responses.

00:51:16.450 --> 00:51:19.460
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so then we would
have them run the experiment

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:21.203
again, but switch buttons.

00:51:21.203 --> 00:51:22.370
NANCY KANWISHER: Good, good.

00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:24.620
Smart, very nice.

00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:26.390
AUDIENCE: Ideally,
we might just have

00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:30.632
them perform a task that's
completely unrelated to looking

00:51:30.632 --> 00:51:32.090
at snakes or thinking
about snakes,

00:51:32.090 --> 00:51:34.750
just so that they're
not affecting--

00:51:34.750 --> 00:51:36.500
NANCY KANWISHER:
Absolutely, and the point

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:37.670
you made before is a good one.

00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:39.670
If you're looking for
snakes all the time, maybe

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:43.147
even if it's apples and dogs,
you're thinking, is it a snake?

00:51:43.147 --> 00:51:43.730
Is it a snake?

00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:46.640
And maybe you're using that
region, and it's a mess, right?

00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.860
Absolutely, yeah.

00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:50.527
All right, so this
is a common challenge

00:51:50.527 --> 00:51:52.193
in experimental design,
and these things

00:51:52.193 --> 00:51:53.490
don't have clear right answers.

00:51:53.490 --> 00:51:55.532
What I want you to do is
just see the trade-offs.

00:51:55.532 --> 00:51:58.670
On the one hand, just
passive viewing, lying there,

00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:59.720
is good in a way.

00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:02.420
The things are just
impinging on your sensoria,

00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:03.980
and it's doing
whatever it will do.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:06.320
But the downside is subjects
fall asleep and get bored,

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:07.890
and you don't know
if they're awake.

00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:08.723
So that's a problem.

00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.420
OK, but the key thing
is whatever the task is,

00:52:14.420 --> 00:52:17.250
you don't want the task
to engage asymmetrically

00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:19.250
with the stimulus condition,
because then you're

00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.830
building in a confound, right?

00:52:21.830 --> 00:52:24.590
So in the group I was in, we
were talking about, well, you

00:52:24.590 --> 00:52:25.640
could have people--

00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:27.590
well, we were talking, actually,
about faces and objects

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:28.132
in that case.

00:52:28.132 --> 00:52:30.522
So you could have
people name the things,

00:52:30.522 --> 00:52:32.480
but if they're naming
snakes versus non-snakes,

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.230
it's not very good if
they're going snake,

00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:38.220
snake, snake, snake,
snake, dog, toaster, apple.

00:52:38.220 --> 00:52:41.210
One is easier than the
other and more repetitive.

00:52:41.210 --> 00:52:43.730
There are all kinds
of problems there.

00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:45.590
All right, baseline conditions.

00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:47.690
I didn't really say what
a baseline condition was.

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:49.700
Sorry about that.

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:52.520
What I meant by a baseline
is different from a control

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.120
condition.

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:55.400
The control condition
would be like non-snakes

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:57.620
contrasted with the snakes.

00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.040
Baseline tends to be like a
minimalist condition that's

00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.710
supposed to turn the brain off.

00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:05.870
Can we turn the brain off?

00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:09.050
No, of course not, but
we can aspire toward it.

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:11.240
We can go partway out there.

00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:13.760
We can say, OK, if
we're studying vision,

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.950
let's minimize activity in the
visual system as best we can,

00:53:18.950 --> 00:53:19.880
OK?

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.950
So you could just
have a blank screen

00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:23.660
that feels like a
pretty minimal thing.

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.880
You can have people
close their eyes.

00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.710
The reason that, in
vision experiments,

00:53:27.710 --> 00:53:30.290
people tend to have fixation,
where there's a tiny dot

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:33.170
and subjects are supposed
to hold their eyes on it,

00:53:33.170 --> 00:53:36.210
is that in natural- left
of their own devices,

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:38.810
people move their eyes a
lot-- several times a second.

00:53:38.810 --> 00:53:41.720
And moving your eyes produces
all kinds of activity and lots

00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:42.980
of neurons.

00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:46.370
And so it's a very
active visual thing,

00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:48.120
even if there's
nothing on the screen.

00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:51.440
And so staring at dot is
closer to shutting off

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.710
your visual system, even though
it's not shutting it off.

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:58.640
OK, so given that most of the
contrasts we've talked about

00:53:58.640 --> 00:54:01.340
are like faces versus
objects or snakes

00:54:01.340 --> 00:54:04.610
versus non-snakes, and all the
activations that I've shown you

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:09.320
guys are contrast between
an experimental condition

00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:12.753
and a control condition, why
are we bothering with baseline?

00:54:12.753 --> 00:54:14.420
It doesn't even figure
in that contrast.

00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:18.780
Yes, Jimmy?

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:20.460
AUDIENCE: Well, if
the region is truly

00:54:20.460 --> 00:54:24.770
selective for only snakes,
you could use the baseline as,

00:54:24.770 --> 00:54:27.180
in this sense, like a control,
because you can compare

00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:28.470
the other control to it.

00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:30.450
If it's really
selective for snakes,

00:54:30.450 --> 00:54:33.940
then the non-snake object should
respond in the same as the

00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:34.830
[? minimal. ?]

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:36.705
NANCY KANWISHER: Awesome,
everybody get that?

00:54:36.705 --> 00:54:38.310
So that was exactly right.

00:54:38.310 --> 00:54:40.760
And this is, I think, a
very interesting point.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.300
So suppose we have--

00:54:42.300 --> 00:54:44.440
remember, with MRI, you
just have two numbers.

00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.580
So here's the snake
response, and here's

00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:50.170
the non-snake response.

00:54:50.170 --> 00:54:52.770
If we don't have a baseline,
that's all we have--

00:54:52.770 --> 00:54:55.920
two numbers, OK?

00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:57.150
And that's fine.

00:54:57.150 --> 00:55:00.400
If we run enough subjects,
that could be significant.

00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:03.570
But now, let's think what else
we know if we have a baseline.

00:55:03.570 --> 00:55:06.510
Suppose we have a baseline
of staring at dot.

00:55:06.510 --> 00:55:09.038
And that's down here.

00:55:09.038 --> 00:55:10.080
We'll call that fixation.

00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:13.790
Are you impressed?

00:55:13.790 --> 00:55:15.498
And you've run enough
subjects, so that's

00:55:15.498 --> 00:55:16.760
significantly different.

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.660
Are you impressed?

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:24.470
Yeah.

00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:27.110
AUDIENCE: Less so than if
the fixation were higher up.

00:55:27.110 --> 00:55:28.760
NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly!

00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:29.870
Why?

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.720
AUDIENCE: Because then, if
the results are higher up--

00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:35.840
or if the fixation is the
second one that you just drew--

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:39.418
then the response to a snake
is twice as much as non-snake.

00:55:39.418 --> 00:55:40.460
NANCY KANWISHER: Exactly.

00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:42.835
Does everybody see how-- yeah,
that might be significant,

00:55:42.835 --> 00:55:44.090
but who cares, right?

00:55:44.090 --> 00:55:47.150
Some tiny little
ratty-ass effect,

00:55:47.150 --> 00:55:51.830
versus if it's like
here, or even--

00:55:51.830 --> 00:55:54.680
this is the case Jimmy was
talking about, like that.

00:55:54.680 --> 00:55:57.290
No response at all
more than staring at a

00:55:57.290 --> 00:56:01.237
dot to the non-snakes, and yet
this response to the snakes.

00:56:01.237 --> 00:56:02.570
That would even more impressive.

00:56:02.570 --> 00:56:05.990
So there are different
degrees of selectivity, right?

00:56:05.990 --> 00:56:07.970
Not just does it
respond differentially,

00:56:07.970 --> 00:56:09.740
but how selective is it?

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:11.210
Oh, boy, I'm going
way over time.

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:13.370
I'm sorry.

00:56:13.370 --> 00:56:17.127
So you guys did great
thinking through these things.

00:56:17.127 --> 00:56:19.460
And, of course, I didn't get
halfway through my lecture.

00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:21.590
That's OK, we'll roll over
the best parts for later,

00:56:21.590 --> 00:56:22.965
and the ones that
aren't that fun

00:56:22.965 --> 00:56:25.430
will just go by the wayside.

00:56:25.430 --> 00:56:27.810
I will put notes on the rest
of some of these things,

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:29.605
but I think all of
you guys pulled out--

00:56:29.605 --> 00:56:31.730
just thinking hard about
it and using common sense,

00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:33.890
you can see that a lot
of experimental design

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:35.370
is common sense.

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:37.990
All right, see you
guys on Wednesday.

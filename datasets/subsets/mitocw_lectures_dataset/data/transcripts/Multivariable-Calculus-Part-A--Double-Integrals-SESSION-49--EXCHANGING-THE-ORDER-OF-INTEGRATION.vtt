DAVID JORDAN: Hello, and
welcome back to recitation.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:09.010
So the problem I'd like
to work with you today

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.090
is this one here.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.427
It's just to compute this
two-variable integral,

00:00:13.427 --> 00:00:15.510
and the integrand that
we're going to be computing

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.390
is e to the u over u.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.210
And what you might
notice right away

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.700
is that this inner integral,
it's an integral over u of e

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.990
to the u over u, and
this is not an integral

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.790
that we have a nice formula
for from one-variable calculus.

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.460
So I'm going to suggest that,
as you try to solve this,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.470
you think about how can
you use the fact that this

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.984
is a multivariable
integral, maybe

00:00:38.984 --> 00:00:40.400
swapping the order
of integration,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.390
et cetera, to solve this.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.230
So why don't you go ahead and
work this problem on your own.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.730
Check back with me
in a few minutes,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.353
and I'll see how I did it.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.014
OK, welcome back.

00:00:56.014 --> 00:00:57.430
So as I suggested,
I think what we

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.799
should do is we should see
what happens if we switch

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:02.840
the order of integration.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.835
I don't know how to do
this inside integral,

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:06.960
and so maybe if we switch
the order of integration,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.740
then something's
going to work out.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.780
So in order to get
started doing that, we

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.890
need to draw the
region of integration,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.370
so why don't we
do that over here.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.030
So I'll just walk over here.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:28.140
So we've got-- our variables
are t and u, so I've

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.019
drawn the t- and u-axes here.

00:01:30.019 --> 00:01:32.060
And now, let's look at
the region of integration.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.630
So t is running from 0 to 1/4.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.730
So we'll just draw
1/4 about there.

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.235
And now the range for
u, the bottom range

00:01:47.235 --> 00:01:49.355
is the square root
of t, so I'm going

00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:52.255
to draw the curve u is
the square root of t.

00:01:52.255 --> 00:01:55.710
It just looks like a
parabola on its side.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.050
And then the top bound
is at u equals 1/2.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.920
And notice that
when t is 1/4, that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.490
means that u is 1/2, because u
is just the square root of t.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.260
And so what we're
really interested in

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.180
is this region here,
the region between u

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.040
is the square root of
t and between u is 1/2,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.560
so this is our region.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.275
So let's rewrite the
integral by swapping

00:02:29.275 --> 00:02:31.670
the order of integration,
so I'll do that here.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:43.580
So now on the outside, we want
to put the range of u first.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.190
So the range of u, we can
see on the graph here,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.180
u ranges from 0 to 1/2, so
that's going to be easy.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:00.190
And now t, so t is always
starting right here at t

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.610
equals 0, and it's always
ending at this curve, which

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.350
is t equals u squared.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.570
So we have these
little integrals here.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.280
And so our ranges for
t is going to be t

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.580
is running from 0 to u squared.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.920
Then we have the same
integrand e to the u over u,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.370
and now we have dt du.

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.957
All right.

00:03:28.957 --> 00:03:30.790
Now we see that this
was a nice thing to do,

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.420
because look: The first
integral that we need to take

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.485
is an integral in
t, but our integrand

00:03:35.485 --> 00:03:37.110
doesn't involve the
variable t, so this

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.943
is going to be a very
easy integral to take.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.450
So I just take that integrand
and I just multiply it

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.580
by the constant t, so we just
have e to the u over u times t,

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.460
and then it's a
definite integral which

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.160
ranges from u squared to 0, du.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.070
And so this is just
going to be-- 1/2

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:18.320
here-- this is really just
going to be u e to the u du,

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.820
all right?

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.200
So let me write that
up over here again.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.270
So we're at integral from
u equals 0 to 1/2 of u

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.650
e to the u du.

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.724
And now we want to remember
the method of integration

00:04:39.724 --> 00:04:41.223
by parts from
one-variable calculus.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.520
So integration by
parts, you'll remember,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.660
will tell us that the
integral of u e to the u

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:07.010
is going to be u e to
the u minus e to the u.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.480
So that's just applying
integration by parts.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.340
And then this is a
definite integral,

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.350
so we have a range 1/2 to 0.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:21.880
Well, now, we can just plug
this in, so we get 1/2 e

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:31.330
to the 1/2 minus e to the
1/2 minus the quantity--

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:38.680
so we just get 0
minus e to the 0.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.270
And so altogether,
we have-- let's see,

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:50.790
we have a negative e to the
1/2 and then we have a plus 1.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.930
And negative e to
the 1/2 over 2,

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.700
because we had 1/2 and a minus
a whole, and then plus 1.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.540
And that's our solution.

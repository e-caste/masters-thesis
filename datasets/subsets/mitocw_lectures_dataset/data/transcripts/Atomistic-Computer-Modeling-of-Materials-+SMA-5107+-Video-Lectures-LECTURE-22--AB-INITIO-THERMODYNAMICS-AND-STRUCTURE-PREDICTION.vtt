WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.583
GERBRAND CEDER: What
we're going to do

00:00:01.583 --> 00:00:04.750
is work through
several case studies

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.010
so you'll see it get
more and more applied.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.485
I'll start with doing a
little more of alloy theory

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:13.440
and cluster expansions,
which is really

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.360
a follow up on the
Monte Carlo work

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.180
we did and you'll see how that
fits in with course grading.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.480
It's essentially the part we
didn't get to when I finished.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.270
And then I'll do a variety
of things on Tuesday.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.405
One of them is [INAUDIBLE]
accelerated molecular dynamics

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:31.280
technique, which is sort
of a specialty topic

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.040
but it gives you an
idea of where people are

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.000
trying to push the boundaries.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.550
And then on Thursday, we'll
actually have a guest lecture.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.298
We'll have Chris Wolverton from
Ford Motor Company lecture.

00:00:44.298 --> 00:00:46.340
It's kind of cool, he
actually lectures from Ford

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.382
so you're going to see
him project on the screen.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.355
He does that every year
and people usually find

00:00:50.355 --> 00:00:51.480
that a really good lecture.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.300
He essentially
talks about how they

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.650
use modeling in general but in
particular, first principles

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.850
methodology at
Ford Motor Company.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.519
He has a few really
cool stories.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.280
He won't tell you how much
money they save the company,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.210
but it's actually in the
tens of millions of dollars

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.920
so that's why
they're still there.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.670
He won't tell you that,
but I can tell you

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:15.110
that before his talk show.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.110
That's on Thursday, and then
we go into the last week

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.360
and I think we have only
one more lecture left there.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.330
So one of the things
I want to do today

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.920
is be a little more systematic
about some of the models we've

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.020
introduced for your lab.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.270
We introduced this lattice
model, for example,

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.417
to model hydrogen
absorption on palladium

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:42.250
and several people have
questions, you know?

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.920
How do you know that
this is a good model?

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.220
Those lattice models
actually occur

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.360
all the time in a solid
state structure equilibration

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.780
thermodynamics and I'll go
through them a little more

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.970
systematic today and
then towards the end

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.770
prove to you that
they actually are

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.580
a very accurate representation
of the thermodynamics

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.350
of real systems.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:15.870
So let me show you again where
they will tend to show up.

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.050
I introduced the
lattice model too simply

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.480
as a magnetic spin model,
and that's how we started.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.260
You model a magnet and you
have up and down spins.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.110
But as soon as you realize
that those spins are really

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.360
just general
occupation variables,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.030
they tell you the result
of a binary outcome,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.540
you can also use
them to represent

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.100
a whole lot of other things.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.130
For example, if you
look at superstructures

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.470
in the copper-gold system--

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.100
copper is FCC, gold is FCC,
all the structures in between

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.750
are in an FCC lattice.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.750
So if you really want to know
how they look, the question is,

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.290
how do you distribute copper
and gold on an FCC lattice?

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.900
So really all you need to
know is on every lattice site,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.210
is there a copper there
or is there a gold?

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.970
Again, that's a binary
outcome, so you can represent

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.190
that with spin variables.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.410
So essentially the energetics
and thermodynamics of this

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.640
will be represented by a spin
model, also by a lattice model.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.970
It doesn't necessarily
have to be atoms,

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.928
it can be atoms and vacancies.

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:20.720
This is an example I'll
come back to later,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.910
this is lithium cobalt oxide.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.160
The purple things up there
are lithium, red is oxygen,

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.240
and the green is cobalt. You
can actually extract lithium

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.850
from these materials,
and so start

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:36.650
removing some of the lithiums.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.270
And so essentially
what you have then

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.900
is a distribution problem
of lithiums and vacancies

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.100
on a given set of sites.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.650
In this case, those planes
that you're looking head on

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.990
are actually triangular
lattices, OK?

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:49.680
And I'll come back
to that as well.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.150
So here the spin variable would
indicate whether the site is

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.920
occupied by a lithium or not.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.850
You can do surfaces.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.370
Lattice models are
classics for surfaces.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.410
Here's a typical 111 surface
with stuff absorbed on it.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.930
So if you look at an
FCC metal like platinum

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.810
and you look at the 111
surface, the absorption sites

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.860
have the same symmetry.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.890
For example, the hollows,
which I've indicated here.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.160
So the hollows form a
triangular lattice, OK?

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.540
And so if you look
at absorption,

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.880
again, all you need to
know is, is there something

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.040
at the absorption site or not?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.770
So again, you would
use a binary variable.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.570
So what I first
want to show you is

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.250
that an Ising-like model
or a lattice Hamiltonian,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.930
as you've seen
before, is actually

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.020
a very natural way
of writing the energy

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.400
and actually, I
extend that later

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.120
to any property
of configuration.

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.190
So I'm going to do that
a little more formally

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.740
than we've done before.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.570
Essentially if you
want to study all

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.490
of these models that
are lattice models,

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.033
you need some
Hamiltonian for them.

00:05:11.033 --> 00:05:12.450
And so I'm going
to use this sigma

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.910
between these squiggly
brackets as a variable

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.850
to indicate the configuration
on the whole lattice.

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:25.080
So the variable sigma is
essentially a combination

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.840
of sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 3.

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.050
So you can think of as a vector
in the configurational space

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.030
of all the occupation variables.

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.450
So what you need
is a practical way

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:41.410
of writing that
configurational Hamiltonian,

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.160
and the way you make
you write almost

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.563
any practical Hamiltonian
or any practical energy

00:05:46.563 --> 00:05:48.480
function that you want
as accurate as possible

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:51.630
is that you write it as some
expansion in a suitable basis

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.200
set of functions.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.940
OK?

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.250
Think of how you
explain wave functions

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.720
in plane waves,
how you sometimes

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.690
expend in sines or cosine.

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:02.430
The typical basis
that's used here

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:05.670
is what's called
cluster functions.

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.120
A cluster function, which I'm
going to label by phi alpha,

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:12.540
is essentially the spin
product of all the sites

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.380
of that cluster alpha.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:22.740
So if I make a pair cluster,
let's say this one, i and j,

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:27.750
the cluster function phi alpha
then is sigma i times sigma j.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:30.240
But I can make many other ones.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.780
I could make a four body
one, they don't even

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.350
have to be connected.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.255
And so for the red,
phi alpha would be--

00:06:39.255 --> 00:06:42.990
let's call it i, j,
k, l, would be sigma

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.014
i, sigma j, sigma k, sigma l.

00:06:47.014 --> 00:06:47.514
OK?

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.630
I think the computer gets more
tired as well as we proceed.

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.970
OK.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:12.930
The first thing, so when
you expend in a basis,

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.290
you want to make sure that the
basis is complete to describe

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.170
your full space and
then sometimes it's

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.520
useful that your basis
set is orthogonal,

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.690
although that's not
really necessary,

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:27.330
but it can be practical.

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:29.760
It's easy to see here
that it's complete.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.100
I mean, if you have
n lattice sites,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.740
what's the size of the space?

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.990
What's the size of the
configurational space?

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.150
Well, it's 2 to the n.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:43.830
On each lattice point you can
put two things, essentially,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:46.440
so the number of
combinations is 2 to the n.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.690
Well, how many basis
functions are there?

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:52.560
Well, if you think of what's
the choice of basis function,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:59.630
it's essentially picking
a combination of sites.

00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:01.630
So that's also 2 to the n.

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.910
There are 2 to the n
combinations of sites

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:05.650
because it's also
a binary problem.

00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.950
For every site, you include
it or you don't include it

00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:10.640
in the basis function.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.420
So there are 2 to the
n basis functions.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.380
I'm going to show you in a
second that they're orthogonal.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.060
The basis that is complete,
in a very trivial sense,

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:22.300
there are as many basis
functions as states.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.080
OK?

00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:25.900
So you may ask yourself,
what have you won?

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.930
We're actually going to expend
things in this basis set,

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.070
but there's as many
basic functions as state.

00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:34.130
Well, the hope is that we can
formulate these basis functions

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:36.340
so that whatever
quantity we expend

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.990
is more rapidly convergent.

00:08:41.679 --> 00:08:45.690
So let me prove you that the
basis set is orthogonal if you

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:48.460
take a suitable scalar product.

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.330
The way I'm going to define the
scalar product between, say,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:54.000
any two functions of
configuration, which

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.160
I'll call f sigma and g sigma.

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.730
OK?

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.700
I'm going to define the
scalar product simply

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.130
as the sum over the
configuration space

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:03.830
properly normalized.

00:09:03.830 --> 00:09:04.470
OK?

00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.410
So this is equivalent
to if you're

00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:12.180
working in a continuous
space defining your scalar

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.370
product as the integral
of the product of the two

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.323
functions over the
configuration space,

00:09:16.323 --> 00:09:18.240
and you might be more
familiar because we have

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.190
a discrete configuration space.

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:22.380
That integral is
essentially a sum

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.170
over all the possible
configurations.

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.730
Let me prove you that the
functions are orthogonal.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:32.370
First you can note
that for any basis

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:36.840
function, if you sum its value
over the space it gives you 0.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.987
And you can easily see that--

00:09:39.987 --> 00:09:41.820
let's say that function
would look something

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.150
like sigma i, sigma j, sigma
k, maybe even more terms,

00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:48.270
essentially these
terms will alternate

00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:53.040
as having plus and minus 1
and so they will sum to 1.

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:56.220
Using that, you can easily
prove that the functions

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.910
are orthogonal.

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:02.160
So if you [? adopt ?]
the two basic functions

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.960
into each other, so
you're essentially

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:07.860
summing their product, OK?

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.730
So let's say we have a cluster
alpha and a cluster beta,

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:16.440
maybe this is the
cluster alpha and maybe

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.730
this is the cluster beta.

00:10:20.358 --> 00:10:22.105
OK, so they have
a partial overlap.

00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:27.010
So you can write the
product of alpha and beta

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:29.650
then as first as the
product of the spins

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.410
that are in both alpha and beta.

00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:34.990
And for those, you
get sigma i squared,

00:10:34.990 --> 00:10:37.930
and then the spins
that are only in alpha

00:10:37.930 --> 00:10:40.240
and the spins that
are only in beta.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.850
Of course, sigma i
squared is always one

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.200
because sigma is plus or minus
1 your occupation variable

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.650
in a spin model, so
essentially this goes away.

00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:51.940
OK?

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.595
And this is simply a function.

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.620
You could write
this as the basis

00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:09.960
function of alpha plus theta
minus alpha intersection beta.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.460
OK?

00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.330
You're essentially
here multiplying

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.090
all the spins that are
only in alpha or only

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:18.030
in beta, but not in both.

00:11:18.030 --> 00:11:20.790
So that's trivially 0.

00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:25.110
So the only time that
this product is not 0

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.260
is when this part
doesn't exist, so that

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:31.843
means when all things are
in both alpha and beta.

00:11:31.843 --> 00:11:32.770
OK?

00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:36.720
So this product is equal
to the Kronecker delta.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.730
It's actually not this
product, I'm sorry.

00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.458
It's this product summed
over all configuration,

00:11:42.458 --> 00:11:43.500
so I should correct this.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.770
It's 1 over 2 to
the n some stigma

00:11:48.770 --> 00:11:50.480
and then that should
go in front of here.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:56.320
So the basis set
is orthogonal, OK?

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.450
So we have a very
practical expansion now,

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.150
we have a complete and
orthogonal expansion.

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.910
So one of the first
things we're going to do

00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:19.090
is expend the energy
in this basis set,

00:12:19.090 --> 00:12:21.820
because the energy is a
quantity we'll need in things

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:23.680
like Monte Carlo simulation.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:26.170
But you should right
away see that this

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:28.180
is much more powerful, huh?

00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:31.090
You can expend any
property of configuration

00:12:31.090 --> 00:12:33.420
in this basis set.

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.970
They may have different
rates of conversions,

00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:39.210
but essentially
this is a basis set

00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:42.780
in which you can expend anything
that depends on how you arrange

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.460
the items on a lattice.

00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.710
So people have done
things like expend

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:49.540
the band gap of materials.

00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.360
And if that converges
fast, you have

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:54.120
a model that you can
rapidly search then.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:58.950
People have expended things like
the vibrational entropy in it,

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.740
people have expended
things like--

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:03.930
even tried to expend
things like connectivity,

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:05.418
and so which goes not as well.

00:13:05.418 --> 00:13:06.960
But essentially
anything that becomes

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.590
a property of the arrangement
of atoms on that lattice,

00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:14.070
so in that substitution
space can be expended.

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:16.780
For now we're going to
stick to the energy.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.950
So if we expend the energy as
a function of configuration,

00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:24.330
so we get an expansion over all
the possible clusters alpha,

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:27.757
the basis function, and then
the expansion coefficient,

00:13:27.757 --> 00:13:30.090
which we'll call v alpha, and
so of course the expansion

00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:31.548
coefficient that's
going to contain

00:13:31.548 --> 00:13:34.690
all the energetic information.

00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:37.720
And I'll show you in a
second how it's defined,

00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.770
but first I want to write out
what this cluster expansion,

00:13:41.770 --> 00:13:43.720
as it's called, looks like.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.310
I mean, if you pull out what
these cluster functions are you

00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:51.730
essentially get something
that looks like this.

00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:57.320
There'll be an empty cluster
function, so that's this term.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.450
When alpha is just a point
you'll have this term.

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:05.780
So this is almost like point
site energies or chemical

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:07.070
potential like.

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:10.310
If alphas are pairs, you'll
get the standard pair term

00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:13.670
that we see in lattice models,
but this keeps on going.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:17.310
You'll have triple terms,
quadruplet terms, and so on.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.880
So essentially the
cluster expansion

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.130
is the same as what's
called a generalized Ising

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:24.590
model or "Easing" model, OK?

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:29.780
So where you go away from
relying only on two body terms

00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:34.040
to higher body terms as well,
and what it essentially is

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.410
is a generalization
of that approach.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.950
I'm sorry, I'm going
back and forth.

00:14:39.950 --> 00:14:44.060
I'm interchanging and using e
and h, h for the Hamiltonian,

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:46.190
e for the energy, and
one of the reasons

00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:48.050
is that I
cut-and-paste equations

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:51.620
from various PowerPoint
slides and wasn't

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:57.350
quite able to modify them due
to the great Microsoft software.

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:58.970
OK.

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:00.920
But I think what's
the really nice thing

00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:06.810
is that this formal expansion
will allow you to define

00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:10.430
exactly what these v's are
because you may have asked

00:15:10.430 --> 00:15:12.950
yourself when you
were doing in the lab

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.770
and are probably still doing
the hydrogen on palladium,

00:15:15.770 --> 00:15:17.900
what those interactions
actually are?

00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:19.400
Are they sort of
physical potentials

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.660
between the hydrogen or not?

00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:22.400
You'll see in a second
that they're not,

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.890
they're much more
complex than that.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.940
OK.

00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:39.820
So whenever you write an
expansion in orthogonal basis

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:42.530
functions, how do you get
the expansion coefficient?

00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:45.700
Well, the expansion
coefficient is essentially

00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:49.540
the projection of your function
onto the corresponding basis

00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.670
function, and that's
what you'll see here

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.040
and you'll get something
really interesting come out.

00:15:55.040 --> 00:16:00.160
So the way to know how
a v alpha is defined,

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.290
you can essentially
take the scalar product

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:05.980
of this expression on
both sides with phi beta.

00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.860
So you multiply with
phi beta and then

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.582
some overall configurations.

00:16:11.582 --> 00:16:13.540
So you're essentially
taking the scalar product

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:20.940
here, phi beta, phi beta.

00:16:20.940 --> 00:16:25.790
On this n, we know that
this is the Kronecker delta,

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.000
so this is v beta.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:28.780
OK?

00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.150
So we've projected out v
beta out of this expansion,

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:34.570
and then we have to
work out essentially

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:39.400
what this is to know
exactly what v beta means.

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.970
And you'll see this is the
projection of the energy

00:16:42.970 --> 00:16:44.530
onto the basis
function [? phi a, ?]

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:46.540
but it's interesting
when you work that out

00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:48.720
what it physically looks like.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.220
So that's what I'm
going to do here,

00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.570
so I've written out the
scalar product here.

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.040
OK.

00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.230
What I'm going to
do is I'm going to--

00:16:56.230 --> 00:17:00.190
this is the sum over all
possible configurations

00:17:00.190 --> 00:17:01.880
of the lattice.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.010
Since I have a basic
function phi beta here,

00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:08.540
I'm going to separate that into
a sum over the configurations

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.829
on the spins that
belong to beta.

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:15.440
So let's say this is
beta, sum triplet.

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.810
So I'm going to sum
over those spins

00:17:17.810 --> 00:17:21.260
and then separate that and
sum over all the other spins

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:23.069
on the rest of the lattice.

00:17:23.069 --> 00:17:27.170
So I've written that here
as a sum over all the i's--

00:17:27.170 --> 00:17:29.300
sorry, this should be sigma i--

00:17:29.300 --> 00:17:32.750
that are in beta and summing
over all the configurations,

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.880
you get that by just
making all the sigma

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.640
i's plus or minus 1, OK?

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:40.940
And then summing over
the configuration space

00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.850
minus what lives on beta,
and this is a bit shorthand

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:44.400
notation.

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.130
It's a little hard to write
formally what you're actually

00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.970
doing here.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:52.400
But those of you who are
familiar with quantum mechanics

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:55.490
and so may recognize
this as a reduced trace.

00:17:55.490 --> 00:18:00.620
You're essentially tracing over
all of the configuration space

00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.830
except what lives on beta, OK?

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:06.020
OK, so what I want
to do is work out

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:10.670
the example for pair interaction
since the math is about just

00:18:10.670 --> 00:18:12.050
the right level to do in class.

00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.820
The three body gets
a little harder.

00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:17.690
So we're going to work
this out when phi--

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.550
sorry, when beta consists
of sites i and j,

00:18:21.550 --> 00:18:24.110
so it's a pair interaction.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.450
So you see that
in this first term

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:31.600
I'm going to get four terms
because I have two sides.

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.660
I can do a or b, let's say.

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:45.090
Let me call plus 1 is [? ac ?]
and minus 1 is [? b. ?] So

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:51.390
let's say I do the term i
equals plus 1, j equals plus 1.

00:18:51.390 --> 00:18:52.170
OK?

00:18:52.170 --> 00:18:57.590
So the basis function
is going to be 1

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:59.750
because I have plus
1 times plus 1,

00:18:59.750 --> 00:19:02.390
and then what is this really?

00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:04.950
Think about this.

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:10.710
So when i and j are plus
1, that means I essentially

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:14.580
decorate this cluster
of sites i and k

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.860
with an a atom and an a atom.

00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.510
So it's an a, a pair.

00:19:18.510 --> 00:19:19.530
But what is this term?

00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:28.130
Essentially I'm summing over
all the configurations outside

00:19:28.130 --> 00:19:31.470
of this cluster, all the spins.

00:19:31.470 --> 00:19:35.420
So this is essentially
the average energy

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:40.047
of the configuration
with a, a pairs at i,

00:19:40.047 --> 00:19:43.200
j, because look at
what I'm summing over.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.670
So I'm summing it
over the energy of all

00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:49.460
the possible
configurations, but it's

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:52.790
configurations that have a fixed
theta occupancy because I'm not

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:54.680
summing over beta.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.620
So this first term
is essentially

00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:04.030
what I'll call EAA averaged
So you see what it is?

00:20:04.030 --> 00:20:11.130
It's I put a at i,
a at j, and then

00:20:11.130 --> 00:20:16.300
I essentially trace over the
remaining configuration space.

00:20:16.300 --> 00:20:18.000
So I put all possible
configurations

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.114
on the rest of the system and
calculate that average energy.

00:20:22.114 --> 00:20:22.614
OK?

00:20:25.490 --> 00:20:28.070
So you can do that
for the other terms.

00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.330
So I'll write out
explicitly now V ij,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.450
because beta is a cluster
consisting of i and j.

00:20:37.450 --> 00:20:41.530
We're going to find this n beta
is the number of sites in beta,

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:45.850
so we get 1 over 4 because
the number of sites is 2.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.330
So the first term I got was EAA.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.740
OK.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.340
If I do i equals minus 1 and
j equals minus 1 I'll get,

00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:00.310
again, plus 4 phi beta.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:02.440
So I get plus EBB.

00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.680
And then if I do i and j a
different spin, so plus 1

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:19.525
and minus 1, I'm going to
get minus EAB minus EBA.

00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.610
OK?

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:26.230
Does everybody roughly
see where that comes from?

00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:29.880
So I essentially
explicitly evaluate

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.200
the four terms in that sum
and every time, I essentially

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.780
get the average energy
of that configuration.

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:46.910
If your system is symmetric,
if i and j are equivalent,

00:21:46.910 --> 00:21:48.680
then these are the same.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:49.180
OK?

00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:51.460
If you have translational
symmetry between i and j,

00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.850
so then you'll get
something like minus 2EAB.

00:21:54.850 --> 00:21:57.730
And those of you who've seen
regular solution thermodynamics

00:21:57.730 --> 00:22:02.060
may recognize this very
much as a sort of effective

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.360
pre-factor in the
entropy of mixing.

00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:07.480
You'll get something like the
AA interaction plus the BB

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.270
interaction minus 2
times the AB interaction,

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.800
just sort of pointing that out.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:13.217
But it's sort of
interesting, this

00:22:13.217 --> 00:22:15.880
is the formal definition of
the expansion coefficients.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.610
First of all, note that
they are not potentials,

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.510
they are energies.

00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:21.620
OK?

00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:24.390
And they are energies
of configurations.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:32.480
So this is not the potential
between the a atom at i

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.810
and the a atom at j, OK?

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:39.050
The reason is that the
configuration around it

00:22:39.050 --> 00:22:43.600
modifies that interaction
substantially, OK?

00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:47.780
Typically what you'll find
is that these v's are much,

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.473
much smaller than direct
interaction energies,

00:22:50.473 --> 00:22:52.390
and the reason is they
contain enormous amount

00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.860
of cancellation.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.630
If you think about it, this
is AA energy, BB energy,

00:22:58.630 --> 00:23:00.530
and minus 2 times the AB energy.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.860
So they're often several
orders of magnitude

00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:08.560
smaller than direct interactions
if such a thing were to exist.

00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:13.990
The other thing is
that indirect effects

00:23:13.990 --> 00:23:18.400
can be included, like if
you truncate your lattice

00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:21.780
model at pair terms.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.350
OK?

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.030
Because it's an infinite
expansion, at some point

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:25.290
you'll have the truncate it.

00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:28.740
You are still including many
body quantum mechanical effects

00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.490
because the many body quantum
mechanical effects enter

00:23:32.490 --> 00:23:36.090
in the calculation of
the energy of these, OK?

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:39.450
So what you should understand
is that the level of physics

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:43.200
or the level at which
you truncate the cluster

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.030
expansion, the
lattice Hamiltonian,

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:47.910
has no correspondence to the
level of physics for, say,

00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:49.710
your electron physics.

00:23:49.710 --> 00:23:52.140
OK?

00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.840
Let me give you an
example just to think

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.270
through what these things are.

00:23:57.270 --> 00:24:01.920
Let's say you had a model on
a lattice where things just

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.840
interacted with
pair potentials, OK?

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.090
So a very simplistic
energetic scheme.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:15.350
If the atoms don't relax
away from the lattice points,

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:21.700
then these energies can really
be written as a pairwise sum

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:23.680
because then the total
energy of a system

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:27.153
is really the pairwise
sum between all the pairs.

00:24:27.153 --> 00:24:28.570
Then now what
you're going to find

00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:32.850
is that essentially,
all of the pairwise sum

00:24:32.850 --> 00:24:37.260
cancels in this
difference except the AA

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:40.570
interaction, the BB interaction,
and the AB interaction.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:44.760
So if you do just a
pairwise energy expression--

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:48.030
and should try this one,
it's very pedagogical--

00:24:48.030 --> 00:24:51.570
and the atoms don't relax
away from the lattice,

00:24:51.570 --> 00:24:56.550
then you'll find exactly that
these are pair energies, pair

00:24:56.550 --> 00:24:57.910
potentials.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:00.620
Now as soon as you let the atoms
relax away from the lattice

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:04.170
point, like maybe the a one
is bigger than the b one,

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:07.620
even in a pairwise energy
Hamiltonian these will not be

00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:13.510
the pair interactions because
you cannot remove from these

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:14.010
energies.

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:19.050
You cannot cancel the energetic
effects between a and the rest

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:22.770
of the material and b and
the rest of the material, OK?

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.400
So the really cool thing about
these expansion coefficients

00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.940
is that they will include
all that extra physics,

00:25:29.940 --> 00:25:34.350
like relaxation away from
the equilibrium lattice site,

00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:36.420
and I'll come back
to that later.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:51.320
Come on.

00:25:54.650 --> 00:25:55.650
Shouldn't write so much.

00:26:18.015 --> 00:26:19.732
I think class is over, no?

00:26:28.096 --> 00:26:31.470
Ah, there we go.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:37.490
So I'll go back and forth
between writing the cluster

00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:41.210
expansion in terms of the phi
alpha, so the basis function,

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:43.310
or being more
explicit and writing

00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:47.720
the basic functions out as the
products of spins right away.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.630
So all your physics
of your system,

00:26:50.630 --> 00:26:55.170
all the energetics sits in
those coefficients v of course.

00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:57.560
So the question is,
how do you get them?

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.663
Well, there's a lot
of different ways

00:26:59.663 --> 00:27:01.080
that people have
tried to get them

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.900
and it depends a little
bit on the problem.

00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:08.240
For simple Hamiltonians,
you can often really

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.180
just calculate them directly
by their definition,

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:13.220
essentially as the
projection of the energy

00:27:13.220 --> 00:27:15.890
onto that basis function.

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:19.490
You can do that for
pairwise Hamiltonians even

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:21.740
including forced relaxation.

00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:24.530
So even when atoms
don't sit on a lattice,

00:27:24.530 --> 00:27:27.650
you can do it by
Fourier transforming,

00:27:27.650 --> 00:27:30.860
and that's in one of the
reference that I give you.

00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:33.980
But as soon as your
physics is very multibody,

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.770
it becomes very hard
to do it analytically.

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:39.260
There are people who do
it numerically very much

00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:41.430
according to the definition.

00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:44.960
So you literally take a
system and put an AA atom here

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.330
and then calculate a lot
of different configurations

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:48.360
around that.

00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.960
And so literally start to
approximate those averages,

00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.840
EAA average, EBB average.

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:59.120
The practical way that people
pretty much do it now most

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.790
of the time, which is also
the least elegant way,

00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:05.180
is that essentially, you fit
your whole expansion at once

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.920
to a large number of
energy calculations.

00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.680
So the first thing you
have to do, of course,

00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:13.070
is to truncate your
Hamiltonian because this

00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.640
is an infinite expansion.

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.070
You should really see this,
this is a trivial expansion.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:21.440
You're expending 2 to
the n quantities and 2

00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.840
to the n basis function, OK?

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.720
So it's only practical
if you truncate it,

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:29.660
but once you truncate you have
a finite set of coefficients

00:28:29.660 --> 00:28:30.890
to determine.

00:28:30.890 --> 00:28:34.100
So what you can do is literally
calculate the Hamiltonian,

00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:38.540
or in this case, the energy for
a lot of these configurations.

00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:42.020
Let's say there's 20 of these
v's you have to determine, then

00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:44.330
essentially if you
have the energy at 20

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:49.730
different configurations you
could determine the interaction

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:51.050
coefficients.

00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:54.140
Typically people use very
over-determined sets.

00:28:54.140 --> 00:28:58.130
So if you want 20 of these,
you may do 50 of 50 energies

00:28:58.130 --> 00:29:00.800
and do a squares
fitting just to make

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.490
the determination of
interactions much more stable.

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:06.080
So that's essentially
how it's done.

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.550
You have an energy method.

00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.620
I wrote it as a first
principles method

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:11.690
here, could be
any energy method.

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.930
You calculate a lot of energies
of different configurations

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:18.720
and then you fit the Hamiltonian
and you plot the interactions

00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.220
out.

00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:22.250
It's really that simple.

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.580
And once you have your
lattice model Hamiltonian,

00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.420
you now know that it's fairly
easy to equilibrate that.

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:32.510
So you can get ground
states out of that,

00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.173
you can do a Monte
Carlo simulation on it

00:29:35.173 --> 00:29:36.590
just like you're
doing in the lab,

00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.740
and then get phase diagrams
thermodynamic properties out.

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:45.220
So essentially you can get
both the structures and all

00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.275
the thermodynamic information
and more important,

00:29:47.275 --> 00:29:48.650
as I'll show you
in a second, all

00:29:48.650 --> 00:29:50.590
the information
you can derive from

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:53.320
the thermodynamic information,
which is something people

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.658
often forget.

00:29:55.658 --> 00:29:57.200
So what I was going
to do is show you

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:01.880
a few examples of how this
is used and then in the end,

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:06.000
essentially come back to
some of the theory of that.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.030
So here's one that shows
how elegant it can be.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:15.130
What I'm going to show
you is a calculation

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:18.310
to try to get the solid
part of the calcium oxide,

00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:21.060
magnesium oxide phase diagram.

00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:24.400
This is perfect for
a cluster expansion.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.960
Calcium oxide and
magnesium oxide

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.980
are both rock salt structures.

00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.000
So a rock salt is
essentially an FCC lattice

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.040
of oxygens, which I think are in
this picture, the purple ones.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.680
And then the cations,
either calcium or magnesium,

00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:41.770
sit in the octahedral sites,
octahedral interstitials.

00:30:41.770 --> 00:30:44.260
And the octahedral
interstitials of an FCC lattice

00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:46.300
also form an FCC lattice.

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:49.090
So you can think of rock salts
as two interpenetrating FCC

00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:52.240
lattices, one of
cations, one of anions.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:55.540
So when you mix the
two, you're essentially

00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.960
asking the question,
at each interstitial

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:01.430
is there a calcium or a
magnesium sitting there?

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:03.280
So again, you have a
perfect binary problem.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:05.050
It's a lattice model.

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:09.070
But this already illustrates
a nice thing of this approach,

00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.010
in your whole lattice model,
the oxygens won't appear.

00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:17.600
So the variables
you use are only

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:21.120
going to be defined on
the cation lattices.

00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.920
So the cations are
the smaller ones.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.940
So on this one, you'll
have sigma i say plus 1

00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:30.110
and on this one, you'll
have sigma j equals minus 1.

00:31:30.110 --> 00:31:35.010
So you're essentially going
to express the energy solely

00:31:35.010 --> 00:31:42.630
in terms of spin variables
on the cation sites,

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:43.920
and that makes sense.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.590
There's nothing unknown
about the anion sites.

00:31:46.590 --> 00:31:48.990
They're always
fully occupied, OK?

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:51.540
So the anions will show
up when you calculate

00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.880
the energies of these
configurations, of course,

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.840
but there's really no
need to expend the energy

00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:00.550
in their occupation variables
because they're always there.

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:02.190
They're always minus 1.

00:32:02.190 --> 00:32:03.570
So you see, we're
going to end up

00:32:03.570 --> 00:32:07.890
with an effective Hamiltonian
between the cations that

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:12.420
includes the energetic
intermediary of the anions

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.100
without explicitly
including them.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:19.784
So how do you do
something like that?

00:32:19.784 --> 00:32:25.560
Well, you truncate your
Hamiltonian [? number, ?]

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.360
it's always going to
be the same procedure.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:31.500
You calculate the energy, a lot
of different configurations.

00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.470
This is old work, so it wasn't
fully quantum mechanical.

00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:37.260
There are two sets of points--
so this is actually energy--

00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.765
I'm sorry, this is in
electron volt per cation.

00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.640
The blue points are done
with empirical potentials.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:50.140
Remember, we did that all the
way in the beginning of class?

00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:53.350
These are essentially
Buckingham potentials

00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:57.370
with electrostatics and shell
models attached to them.

00:32:57.370 --> 00:33:03.310
And the open red circles
is a self-consistent PIB,

00:33:03.310 --> 00:33:07.150
which is a really poor
man's quantum mechanics.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:10.540
It's a sort of intermediate
between Thomas Fermi theory

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.730
and better quantum
mechanics, but think of it

00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:16.660
as a poor man's
quantum mechanics,

00:33:16.660 --> 00:33:18.400
and these are mixing energies.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.170
So they're referenced to
0 here and here, that's

00:33:23.170 --> 00:33:26.200
why they have that parabolic
shape because you force them

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.200
to 0 at 0 and 1.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.600
First of all,
they're positive so

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.310
that means the two
things don't want

00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:36.220
to mix, which is in accordance
to the phase diagram,

00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:37.720
but you may notice
something already

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.040
that's kind of interesting.

00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.530
The quantum mechanical
values actually

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:44.230
tend to be lower than
the potential ones,

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.960
and this is very common.

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:52.720
Typically a better
energy model will

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.140
lower the energy of
low symmetry states

00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.380
more than a bad energy model.

00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:04.680
And the reason is that usually
a good energy model has

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.830
more degrees of freedom, OK?

00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.699
If you think of your potential
model has no electrons in it.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:14.340
There can be no
electronic relaxation

00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:17.610
by definition in a model
with empirical potentials

00:34:17.610 --> 00:34:20.100
because you don't
have electrons.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:22.780
A quantum mechanical
model has electrons in it

00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:27.860
so you have more ways
for the system to relax.

00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:31.219
And the lower the
symmetry, the more a system

00:34:31.219 --> 00:34:33.170
can actually use those methods.

00:34:33.170 --> 00:34:35.989
If your system is fully
constrained by symmetry,

00:34:35.989 --> 00:34:38.750
then there's barely any
way the system can relax.

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:39.320
OK?

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:42.050
So this is something
you very typically see.

00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:46.639
If you have energy methods
that are fitted to perfect bulk

00:34:46.639 --> 00:34:49.489
properties, so they're fitted
in high symmetry environments,

00:34:49.489 --> 00:34:51.672
if you then use them
on defect properties,

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:53.130
the better the
physics of the model

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.310
or the more degrees
of freedom usually

00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:58.560
the lower the defect
energy will be.

00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:02.700
But anyway, so you use this.

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.370
You'd fit your Hamiltonians
to it, your cluster expansion

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:11.000
to it, and you'd get a
bunch of pair interactions.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.990
So the first six are
pair interactions.

00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:16.940
Again, blue-- oh, dear.

00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:18.190
Changed the color scheme here.

00:35:18.190 --> 00:35:20.350
Blue is the quantum mechanics,
now the open circles

00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:24.530
are the potentials,
and then there

00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:26.450
are some triplets
interactions and

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:28.700
some quadruplets interactions.

00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:33.122
And notice that the first
pair interaction is negative,

00:35:33.122 --> 00:35:34.080
so what does that mean?

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.997
That means the nearest
neighbor's spin product

00:35:35.997 --> 00:35:39.000
wants to be positive,
get your energy down.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.070
So that means like things
want to be together.

00:35:41.070 --> 00:35:42.590
Plus ones want to
be with plus ones,

00:35:42.590 --> 00:35:44.173
minus ones want to
be with minus ones,

00:35:44.173 --> 00:35:45.497
so that's phase separation.

00:35:45.497 --> 00:35:47.330
You can already see it
from the interaction,

00:35:47.330 --> 00:35:50.100
but notice the scale
of the interaction.

00:35:50.100 --> 00:35:55.190
So this is now about 40 milli
electron volt per cation.

00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:56.540
So this is a far cry.

00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:59.900
This is much lower than
any direct electrostatic

00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:04.850
interaction or even any direct
evaluation of a Buckingham

00:36:04.850 --> 00:36:09.120
potential because you have
effective interactions.

00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.860
Actually, if you think
of the definition

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.770
of the effective pair
interaction in this case--

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.830
so let me write it out.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:19.950
So Vij would be 1/4.

00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:24.900
Let me actually put calcium
and magnesium on here.

00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:33.050
So it would be E magnesium,
magnesium averaged plus E

00:36:33.050 --> 00:36:40.955
calcium, calcium minus 2e
calcium, magnesium on the i,

00:36:40.955 --> 00:36:43.430
j sites.

00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:48.140
So you should think about where
that effective interaction

00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.760
comes from because look
at the electrostatics.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.970
Does the electrostatics
contribute?

00:36:55.970 --> 00:36:57.930
Magnesium and calcium
are both 2 plus.

00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:07.860
Essentially if you froze those
two on their lattice sites,

00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:12.480
you'd have in the first term 2
plus 2 plus plus the 2 plus 2

00:37:12.480 --> 00:37:14.970
plus minus 2 times
the 2 plus 2 plus.

00:37:14.970 --> 00:37:17.070
So the electrostatics
completely vanishes

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.740
from the effective
cluster interaction.

00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:22.530
So it's interesting,
the fact that you

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:27.820
do this projection essentially
filters out the largest

00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:30.310
part of the energy
here in the system,

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:33.407
but because it's the same
for both magnesium, magnesium

00:37:33.407 --> 00:37:35.740
and calcium, calcium and
magnesium, calcium interactions

00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:38.770
it's irrelevant for the
configurational thermodynamics

00:37:38.770 --> 00:37:41.560
and the projection
essentially filters that out.

00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:44.345
So where does the
remaining Vij come from?

00:37:44.345 --> 00:37:45.720
Where does the
balance come from?

00:37:51.950 --> 00:37:55.280
If you remember what we taught
you empirical potentials,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:58.040
the way you set up an empirical
potential model for rock sites

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.760
is that you usually have, of
course, the electrostatics,

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.460
then you usually have an
oxygen, oxygen potential--

00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.310
because the oxygen is the
biggest ion, they touch--

00:38:07.310 --> 00:38:10.460
and then you have a
cation, oxygen potential.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:14.510
Rarely do you have a
cation, cation potential.

00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:19.270
So there's not even a direct
potential between the two.

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:23.170
So if you actually froze these
things on their lattice site,

00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:28.420
that Vij is 0 because we just
said that the electrostatics

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.640
disappears.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.390
There is no direct
cation, cation term,

00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:36.600
so Vij is 0 in the case.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.395
So I sort of give
the answer away

00:38:38.395 --> 00:38:41.260
and I said if you freeze these
things on their lattice site,

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.008
where does the
interaction come from?

00:38:43.008 --> 00:38:45.050
Well, if you freeze them,
there's no interaction.

00:38:45.050 --> 00:38:47.850
So all the interaction
comes from relaxation.

00:38:47.850 --> 00:38:48.360
OK?

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.818
The interaction
comes from the fact

00:38:49.818 --> 00:38:52.770
that calcium is
bigger than magnesium

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:54.930
and so that sets up an
effective interaction.

00:38:54.930 --> 00:38:59.340
So it's kind of cool because
with these interactions

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:03.480
you have a Hamiltonian
and a lattice model,

00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.280
which people always
tend to associate

00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:11.380
with frozen positions, but the
interaction comes essentially

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:14.050
from the positions
not being frozen,

00:39:14.050 --> 00:39:17.140
from the fact that the bigger
atom pushes the smaller

00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.040
one away.

00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:18.590
OK?

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:20.170
And so this is
maybe the key point

00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:23.800
to remember that once you
parameterize your Hamiltonian

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:29.270
with relaxed calculations,
that Ising model represents

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:31.400
the energy of those
relaxed configuration.

00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:33.590
Not the ones where you're
frozen at lattice sites.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.590
So when you do
hydrogen on palladium,

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:39.590
a lot of that interaction
that you get between hydrogen

00:39:39.590 --> 00:39:41.840
on one spot on the
surface and the other one

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.243
has nothing to do with
hydrogen, hydrogen interaction.

00:39:44.243 --> 00:39:46.910
It's actually all has to do with
relaxation of the surface sites

00:39:46.910 --> 00:39:48.020
around the hydrogen.

00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:51.350
You put a hydrogen here, the
palladium around it relaxes.

00:39:51.350 --> 00:39:53.990
That's how it sees the
other hydrogen, not because

00:39:53.990 --> 00:39:55.280
of a direct interaction.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:58.400
And with hydrogen
that's not so dramatic.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.530
If you that with other
absorbents like oxygen,

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:02.190
it's very dramatic.

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:05.525
They largely interact through a
strain induced in the surface.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.440
OK.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:22.412
So then you do Monte Carlo,
and here's the phase diagram.

00:40:22.412 --> 00:40:24.120
It's a bit too many
things on this slide,

00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:27.370
but essentially this is the
line you should be looking at.

00:40:27.370 --> 00:40:29.640
This is the one with
potentials, so these

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:34.050
are the solubility limits
at low temperature.

00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:35.790
So it's a two phase
region in between,

00:40:35.790 --> 00:40:42.180
but you have some solubility of
MgO and CaO and of CaO and MgO,

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.890
and this is the
quantum mechanical one.

00:40:46.530 --> 00:40:48.540
So of course this
becomes a miscibility gap

00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:50.750
because there's no
liquid in the calculation

00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:54.060
so if you somehow could include
the free energy of the liquid

00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.800
it would cut off
that miscibility gap

00:40:55.800 --> 00:40:57.030
and form a [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:57.570
OK?

00:40:57.570 --> 00:40:59.070
But because you
don't have a liquid,

00:40:59.070 --> 00:41:02.033
you're essentially looking at
only solid state transitions.

00:41:02.033 --> 00:41:03.450
And again, you see
the same thing.

00:41:03.450 --> 00:41:09.450
The quantum mechanics gives you
a higher solubility limit, so

00:41:09.450 --> 00:41:14.460
a lower temperature which
you can get full solution.

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.030
Because it's sometimes
easier it can deal better

00:41:18.030 --> 00:41:19.460
with the lower symmetry state.

00:41:24.250 --> 00:41:25.060
OK.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.730
So this is the
classic technique now

00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:32.260
to deal with any substitutional
problem and I would say almost

00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:36.250
any crystalline problem
because even if you

00:41:36.250 --> 00:41:39.370
work on systems where
there are multiple lattice

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:40.960
types in play--

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:43.280
I mean, if you think of
simple metals you could think,

00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:44.950
well, maybe there's
some that ordered

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:47.920
on a BCC lattice and some
that order on FCC lattice,

00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:52.030
you can cluster expend
them separately and obtain

00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:55.480
free energies from Monte Carlo
and then put them together.

00:41:55.480 --> 00:41:58.330
That's why this is essentially
the method by which

00:41:58.330 --> 00:42:04.103
any multicomponent crystalline
problem is equilibrated,

00:42:04.103 --> 00:42:05.770
but I'll show you
some of the older work

00:42:05.770 --> 00:42:08.740
just because historically
it's kind of cool.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.240
This is the lithium
aluminum system,

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:13.750
which was I think only the
second or third system that

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.920
was done at [INAUDIBLE]
by this method.

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:19.140
This was done in the early '80s.

00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.585
So the reason they did
this in the early '80s

00:42:22.585 --> 00:42:24.960
because everybody thought we
were going to make airplanes

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.910
out of lithium aluminum
because lithium

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:31.000
is the lightest solid element
in the periodic table.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.090
So any lithium you
can put in an alloy

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:36.060
makes it really
considerably lighter,

00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.180
and the interesting piece
occurs here, which you can see.

00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:43.050
There's a delta phase
here, which is metastable,

00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.310
sits about here.

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:46.740
And what typically people
do is they solution

00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.820
to heat up high temperature then
[? quench ?] down so that you

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:55.740
precipitate out delta phase
to strengthen the alloy.

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.170
It's difficult to
do experimentally

00:42:58.170 --> 00:43:00.330
because this is a
metastable phase,

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:02.070
so it's a little
hard to study it.

00:43:02.070 --> 00:43:07.688
But of course computationally,
all metastability means

00:43:07.688 --> 00:43:10.230
is that there's something else
that's more stable, so as soon

00:43:10.230 --> 00:43:12.480
as you remove that from the
picture and the simulation

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:14.710
you can stabilize it.

00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:18.060
And so this was one of those
early calculations where

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:20.190
they did exactly
what we showed here,

00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:22.200
build a cluster
expansion, parameterize

00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:24.070
it, [INAUDIBLE]
functional theory.

00:43:24.070 --> 00:43:28.530
In this case, did Monte Carlo
do the statistical mechanics

00:43:28.530 --> 00:43:30.420
to find temperature
and essentially get

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:32.520
this calculated phase diagram?

00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:35.863
And this is the
equilibrium phase diagram,

00:43:35.863 --> 00:43:37.530
but then you can also
do the metastable.

00:43:37.530 --> 00:43:40.350
This is the delta phase
precipitated by essentially

00:43:40.350 --> 00:43:43.440
removing the free energy
curves of the stable phases

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:45.510
and look at them.

00:43:45.510 --> 00:43:48.150
The liquid was kind of
empirically added, I think,

00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:49.170
to this calculation.

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.890
This was my own PhD thesis,
so I have to show it.

00:43:56.890 --> 00:43:59.320
Most of my PhD thesis
were just what is 1,

00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:04.120
2, 3, 4, lines, so
I got off easily.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:08.740
But this is the phasing
[INAUDIBLE] copper oxide,

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.340
which probably most
of you familiar

00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:13.270
is a fairly well known high
temperature superconductor.

00:44:13.270 --> 00:44:15.730
And the critical issue, or
one of the critical issues

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.270
was, how the material behaves
as a function of oxygen content.

00:44:19.270 --> 00:44:21.640
Essentially that z
up in the formula

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:25.240
can go anywhere from 6 to 7 and
at 7 it's a high temperature

00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.270
superconductor,
at 6 and 1/2 it's

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.860
a low temperature
superconductor,

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.190
and at 6 it's an
anti ferromagnet.

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:36.100
And so figuring out what the
phase ion looked like was,

00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:39.070
I guess, worth the PhD thesis.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:41.410
And essentially it's, again,
a lattice model problem.

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:43.750
You have a bunch of sites
where the oxygen can sit.

00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:45.560
When you start
taking out the oxygen

00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.850
it's now the site can be
vacant or filled with oxygen.

00:44:49.850 --> 00:44:51.410
So it's a binary problem.

00:44:51.410 --> 00:44:54.160
So you cluster expended
the same thing.

00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:56.680
In those days, the quantum
mechanics wasn't all that good

00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.050
and you did Monte Carlo and
you get a phase diagram.

00:44:59.050 --> 00:45:03.580
And what's neat about this O2,
to my knowledge, this phase--

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.860
I think there's just
some history with it--

00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:08.800
was probably the
first structure I

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:11.380
think that ever was predicted
with quantum mechanics

00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:13.180
before it was seen
experimentally.

00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:15.130
Now there have been a
lot of cases of that,

00:45:15.130 --> 00:45:18.820
but this was actually
in the late '80s,

00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.550
and it may have been
the first case where

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.810
the experimental
evidence came afterwards.

00:45:24.810 --> 00:45:26.190
OK.

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:28.080
Here's a lot more
complicated systems,

00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:30.840
so this is the
lithium cobalt oxide

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.280
I showed you in the beginning.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.220
There's cobalt layers,
there's oxygen layers,

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.890
but the key component
is the lithium layer.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:42.490
As you take lithium out you
have a vacancy lithium problem.

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:45.000
So again, you
expend in variables

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.350
that only describe the
occupation on this layer, OK?

00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.810
So you don't really have
to deal with the cobalt,

00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:53.610
with the oxygen, you
just deal with that

00:45:53.610 --> 00:45:55.890
when you do the
energy calculations

00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:58.810
and you get a bunch of
effective interactions.

00:45:58.810 --> 00:46:03.720
And again, let me stress
that these ECI are

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.340
effective interactions.

00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:07.080
If you look at the
first neighbor,

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.940
it's only 30 milli
electron volt, OK?

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:14.600
To give you an idea, those
first neighbor distances

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.150
in the lithium plane
are about 3 Angstrom.

00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:20.300
If you evaluated the
electrostatic source of a plus

00:46:20.300 --> 00:46:22.910
1 charge and a plus 1
charge over 3 Angstrom,

00:46:22.910 --> 00:46:26.343
you'd get something that's
close to an electron volt. OK?

00:46:26.343 --> 00:46:27.760
But you see, because
you're taking

00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.270
effective interactions
you essentially

00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:32.680
remove most of that.

00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.200
Well, first some
of it is screened--

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:37.600
because you're not in a vacuum
doing your electrostatic,

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.120
some of it is screened
by the oxygens that

00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:42.100
are close by-- but
you're also canceling

00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:45.100
a lot of energetic
effects and really seeing

00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:48.670
the only part that's relevant
for the thermodynamics.

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:51.010
And then you can,
again, do Monte Carlo

00:46:51.010 --> 00:46:54.670
just like we've done in the
lab, get a phase diagram.

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:56.410
This is the kind
of phase diagram

00:46:56.410 --> 00:46:59.380
that you would not get out
of straight Monte Carlo.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:02.840
The hydrogen and palladium
problem we gave you,

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:04.660
you can do that
literally by looking

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:06.070
at the output of
the Monte Carlo,

00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:09.190
by looking at the heat
capacity, looking at the energy,

00:47:09.190 --> 00:47:11.297
because the system
equilibrates very well.

00:47:11.297 --> 00:47:12.880
When it doesn't
equilibrate you really

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:14.500
have to do free
energy integrations

00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:17.290
and look at where
they intersect.

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:20.020
This space also was predicted
three years before it

00:47:20.020 --> 00:47:25.090
was seen experimentally, so
this approach has a really very

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:28.300
powerful predictive
capability because you control

00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.730
almost all the approximations.

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:34.720
So essentially, you have to
live with the approximations

00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.980
in density functional theory.

00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:40.540
So whatever the accuracy of
your electronic Hamiltonian,

00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.320
you can't do any better.

00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:42.970
OK?

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:46.240
But from there, you control
all the approximations.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.490
So if you don't like the
convergence of your cluster

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:51.080
expansion, well, you
add more terms to it.

00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:51.940
OK?

00:47:51.940 --> 00:47:55.810
So essentially you can make
as accurate a representation

00:47:55.810 --> 00:47:58.520
of your quantum
mechanics as you want.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:01.150
And that's why you
can make Hamiltonians

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:04.340
that are very accurate, but
they live on a lattice model

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.430
so they're extremely
fast to search.

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:08.440
I mean, you've done the
hydrogen on palladium.

00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:12.280
Hydrogen on palladium, that
trivial job [INAUDIBLE],,

00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:18.010
this 4, 5 million spin flips
per second on a stupid, old IBM

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:18.940
computer.

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:20.980
So on a new machine,
you can run 10,

00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.480
15 million spin
flips per second,

00:48:23.480 --> 00:48:27.120
so you can search configuration
space extremely fast.

00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:27.790
OK?

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:30.916
And so that's why it's so good
at finding new structures.

00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.170
OK, I was going to show
you a surface problem.

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.810
So here's platinum 111.

00:48:43.810 --> 00:48:45.220
Reason I took
platinum, it's sort

00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:49.300
of an important material for
all kinds of catalysts and so.

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:52.150
And every time you have
these FCC surfaces,

00:48:52.150 --> 00:48:54.670
the possible absorption
sites essentially

00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:56.140
form a triangular lattice.

00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.020
I should go to a
different color here.

00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:04.405
So you have these really old
form of triangular lattice.

00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:16.330
There we go.

00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:18.860
Triangular lattice.

00:49:18.860 --> 00:49:23.840
So if you want to study
the absorption of something

00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:29.373
like hydrogen or oxygen, again,
you build a lattice model.

00:49:29.373 --> 00:49:31.790
Then you have to do density
functional theory calculations

00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:33.500
to parameterize it
and I think you've

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:34.970
done that now in the lab.

00:49:34.970 --> 00:49:38.000
So because this is surface you
would set up a slab geometry.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.050
So you essentially would
take a few layers of platinum

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:46.280
and then put stuff on
the surface to absorb it,

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:53.300
and you arrange a vacuum above
it and do the DFT calculations.

00:49:57.270 --> 00:49:57.770
OK.

00:49:57.770 --> 00:50:00.650
So here's that
result. Again, this

00:50:00.650 --> 00:50:05.090
shows both LD [? and GGA ?]
but again, we plot them--

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:08.030
this is oxygen absorbed
on platinum 111.

00:50:08.030 --> 00:50:11.697
We reference the full coverage
and the zero coverage to 0.

00:50:11.697 --> 00:50:13.280
You may be a little
surprised that you

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:15.618
can set two points to
0 on the energy scale,

00:50:15.618 --> 00:50:16.910
but one, of course, is obvious.

00:50:16.910 --> 00:50:20.408
So you can always reference
one point to 0 on energy scale.

00:50:20.408 --> 00:50:21.950
The reason you can
set the second one

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:23.900
to 0, what you're
essentially doing

00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:27.320
is setting it 0 for
the chemical potential

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.170
because the chemical
potential is, in some sense,

00:50:30.170 --> 00:50:32.780
the slope of that curve.

00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:36.415
It's the energy changed just
by adding oxygen in this case.

00:50:36.415 --> 00:50:37.790
So you're essentially
referencing

00:50:37.790 --> 00:50:43.220
the chemical potential to 0
by setting two points to 0.

00:50:43.220 --> 00:50:45.530
So you do that, same thing.

00:50:45.530 --> 00:50:46.730
You fit interactions.

00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:52.670
I've actually made some
copies of real notes

00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:54.650
so you see how this
is really done.

00:50:54.650 --> 00:50:56.990
So people sketching out
on triangle lattice,

00:50:56.990 --> 00:50:58.400
different interactions.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:01.430
You find their value,
again, they're very small.

00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:04.310
The black points is
for oxygen or platinum,

00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:05.960
the other one is on ruthenium.

00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.680
You know it's about 75 for
a near neighbor interaction

00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.945
and then it decays
very quickly very fast.

00:51:14.540 --> 00:51:17.000
And you know that they actually
have to be in that range

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.270
because if you're going to see
phase transitions in the range

00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:24.500
of, say, 0 to 1,000
Kelvin, your energies have

00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:27.890
to live on that energy scale
and 1,000 Kelvin is what?

00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:30.950
About 100,000--
well, 1,000 Celsius

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:34.280
is about 100 milli electron
volt so your interactions

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:38.780
have to be in that range
for stuff to happen.

00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:42.190
So I thought I'd show you,
rather than a nice picture

00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:44.500
of a phasing-- hold on.

00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.510
So how would you look
for phase transitions?

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:48.380
You do the same stuff
you do in the lab,

00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:51.830
you track heat capacities,
you track energies.

00:51:51.830 --> 00:51:54.250
So this is for the same run,
different oxygen chemical

00:51:54.250 --> 00:51:55.490
potentials.

00:51:55.490 --> 00:52:00.966
So with your experience, what's
happening here at about 940k?

00:52:00.966 --> 00:52:03.520
This clearly looks like
a phase transition,

00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.660
first or second order.

00:52:19.390 --> 00:52:21.370
What's your guess?

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:23.168
Second?

00:52:23.168 --> 00:52:25.210
It's hard to say, but it
looks like second order.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:27.970
I mean, it's maybe not
refined enough to look,

00:52:27.970 --> 00:52:31.780
but there's clearly a
peak in the heat capacity.

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.520
Let's say we take, I don't
know, the green curve,

00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:36.613
which is at the
particular oxygen there's

00:52:36.613 --> 00:52:37.780
a peak in the heat capacity.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:41.440
It's not very well defined, you
shouldn't let yourself mislead.

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:44.710
If you didn't draw the lines
here but just the points,

00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:48.080
that peak is essentially
defined by one point.

00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.880
I mean, you should
always be careful.

00:52:49.880 --> 00:52:52.160
You may have very
spurious behavior going on

00:52:52.160 --> 00:52:54.380
in one similar Monte
Carlo solution.

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:56.300
The other peaks have
slightly more points,

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.950
but normally if
you really wanted

00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:59.840
to know which is
first or second order

00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.500
you would refine it a lot more
near the phase transition.

00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:07.820
Again, the energy
seems to be continuous,

00:53:07.820 --> 00:53:09.800
but don't let the
lines fool you.

00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.110
You've taken, say, this
point and that point

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:14.990
and connected them, so of
course they're continuous,

00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:18.500
but maybe what this thing does
is it continues and then shoots

00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:23.480
down to the other vertically, so
it could still be first order.

00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.573
So you would normally
refine this a lot more.

00:53:25.573 --> 00:53:26.990
And the other
thing, if you really

00:53:26.990 --> 00:53:29.060
want to know that
something's second order,

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.000
you look at the scaling of the
heat capacity with system size

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.730
and that's the
really accurate way

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:36.770
to know that something's
second order.

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:40.160
You're normalized heat capacity
in a second order transition,

00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:42.020
so the heat capacity
per side scales

00:53:42.020 --> 00:53:46.890
like the square root of the
number of lattice sites, OK?

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:49.320
You'll find that already
in your simple example,

00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:52.710
your simple homework problem
of hydrogen on palladium,

00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:57.300
you'll find it remarkably hard
to identify in certain regions

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.210
whether the phase transition
is first or second order.

00:54:00.210 --> 00:54:01.710
That's why you put
them in, they are

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:04.620
are both first and second order.

00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.220
So [INAUDIBLE]
beautiful phasing,

00:54:06.220 --> 00:54:09.540
I thought I'd show you
guys how it's really done.

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:14.340
When we do Monte Carlo, this is
really like a puzzle, you know?

00:54:14.340 --> 00:54:16.980
In papers we always show
these nicely drawn things,

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:19.200
but this is how you get to it.

00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:22.080
You do an enormous
amount of scans in mu.

00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:25.320
So you scan this way, then
you scan in temperature,

00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.410
and you slowly start
piecing together

00:54:28.410 --> 00:54:31.800
which phases exist where,
where they disappear,

00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:34.760
how they disappear, first
or second order reactions.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:40.800
So this is one that is near
completion with a few question

00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:44.080
marks whether these are
like first or second order.

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.110
And then later you
draw nice lines,

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:48.960
but this is one of the
problems with Monte Carlo

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:51.690
because it's a
stochastic method.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:54.510
It really is a lot
a lot of puzzling.

00:54:54.510 --> 00:54:57.570
And what you'll find is
that the last thing that's

00:54:57.570 --> 00:54:59.370
useful, the least
useful thing is actually

00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.290
looking at the spins.

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:02.730
That's people's first intuition.

00:55:02.730 --> 00:55:05.310
I'm going to actually look at
the configuration in my system.

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:09.240
You know, any time systems
are partially disordered,

00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.793
just looking at them is
the best way to fool you.

00:55:11.793 --> 00:55:13.710
If you look at something
partially disordered,

00:55:13.710 --> 00:55:16.252
half of the class will say it's
ordered and half of the class

00:55:16.252 --> 00:55:18.060
will say it's disordered,
and it's really

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:21.190
the thermodynamic behavior
that tells you in which phase

00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:22.200
it still is.

00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:25.470
If it's in an ordered state,
so in a compound state,

00:55:25.470 --> 00:55:28.110
that means that you
should be able to push it

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:29.800
to a disordered state.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:30.300
OK?

00:55:30.300 --> 00:55:32.760
That means you should see
somewhere a phase transition

00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:35.400
as you raise the temperature
or drive the chemical potential

00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:36.270
to another phase.

00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:39.150
If it's already disordered,
if you heat it further up

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:44.280
it won't go to a phase
transition anymore.

00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:44.780
OK.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:51.080
Just to show you that you
can push this a lot harder

00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.720
and make it a lot
more complicated.

00:55:55.540 --> 00:55:59.130
I'll show you something that
gets a little more abstract,

00:55:59.130 --> 00:56:03.060
and it's from a problem that
I worked on quite recently.

00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:05.400
It's absorption
induced segregation,

00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.850
and here's the problem.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:13.350
So the problem before was
oxygen absorbing on platinum,

00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:15.660
but if you have actually
a platinum metal

00:56:15.660 --> 00:56:19.170
alloy like a platinum metal
catalyst, in this case,

00:56:19.170 --> 00:56:21.240
platinum ruthenium,
then you have

00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.710
two configurational problems.

00:56:22.710 --> 00:56:25.670
So the first question is,
what's on the surface?

00:56:25.670 --> 00:56:27.180
Is it oxygen or vacancy?

00:56:27.180 --> 00:56:28.850
Is the site oxygen or vacancy?

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:31.640
But there's also segregation
thermodynamics now.

00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:34.730
On the surface, you now
may not have pure platinum,

00:56:34.730 --> 00:56:39.170
you may have either platinum or
ruthenium and the two interact.

00:56:39.170 --> 00:56:45.010
What segregates to the surface
is influenced by what absorbs.

00:56:45.010 --> 00:56:48.700
You see, you may think of
that as a quaternary problem

00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.380
because essentially,
what's in play now?

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:53.080
Platinum is in play, ruthenium
is in play, oxygen's in play,

00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:54.460
and vacancies are in play--

00:56:54.460 --> 00:56:57.280
vacancies being vacant
absorption sites.

00:56:57.280 --> 00:56:59.870
But it's actually
a 2 plus 2 problem.

00:56:59.870 --> 00:57:01.690
It's really a binary
configuration problem

00:57:01.690 --> 00:57:04.720
in the surface layer and
then a binary configuration

00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.150
problem on top of
the surface layer,

00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:09.580
and so you can still
perfectly solve

00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:13.090
this with a binary
cluster expansion.

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:15.952
It's just that your spin
means something different

00:57:15.952 --> 00:57:17.410
whether you're in
the surface layer

00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:19.900
or whether you're in
the absorbent layer.

00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:22.013
So you could call
them different,

00:57:22.013 --> 00:57:22.930
but you don't have to.

00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:25.910
You could say, well, there
are variables that is,

00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:29.560
say, this describes what's
in the absorption layer

00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.980
and I could just call a
new set of variables delta,

00:57:32.980 --> 00:57:35.830
this describes within
the surface layer,

00:57:35.830 --> 00:57:37.510
and then I could
literally expend

00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:39.510
in the products of these.

00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:42.350
But to be honest, you could
just all call them sigmas.

00:57:42.350 --> 00:57:43.823
OK.

00:57:43.823 --> 00:57:45.240
They just mean
something different

00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:50.050
whether they're defined on
this site or on that site, OK?

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:51.640
And so you can do
the same technique

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:57.640
and now essentially expend
a quaternary problem.

00:57:57.640 --> 00:57:59.890
And you do the same whole
thing, you calculate

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:01.750
a lot of configurations.

00:58:01.750 --> 00:58:04.390
Because your configuration
space is essentially bigger,

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:07.600
you'll need more information
to parameterize it.

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:10.580
And then you do Monte
Carlo and equilibrate it

00:58:10.580 --> 00:58:12.550
and here's an example.

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:16.660
This is, at a given temperature,
driving up the oxygen chemical

00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:19.420
potential so we expect
more oxygen to absorb,

00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:22.340
and that's what you see.

00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:25.160
But you can actually track the
amount of ruthenium segregating

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.952
to the surface and as you bring
more oxygen to the surface,

00:58:28.952 --> 00:58:31.160
you actually start increasing
the amount of ruthenium

00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.850
in the surface as well.

00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:40.260
And so you can really
solve the thermodynamics

00:58:40.260 --> 00:58:42.260
of these problems by
[INAUDIBLE] initial methods

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:43.927
by going through this
cluster expansion,

00:58:43.927 --> 00:58:47.930
but you can actually
look at the sites.

00:58:47.930 --> 00:58:51.750
Orange is the platinum surface,
red is the oxygen absorbed,

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:55.820
and this picture
here is the same

00:58:55.820 --> 00:58:59.000
with the oxygen stripped off so
you see underlying ruthenium.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.033
So as you increase
the oxidation,

00:59:01.033 --> 00:59:02.450
you essentially
get more ruthenium

00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:04.610
to the surface and
more oxidation.

00:59:04.610 --> 00:59:06.620
This is sort of more and
more, higher and higher

00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:09.780
oxygen pressure.

00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:10.280
OK.

00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.810
Let me show you one more
quickly before I continue

00:59:16.810 --> 00:59:18.850
the theory and the
reason I want to show you

00:59:18.850 --> 00:59:22.490
this is because it's sort
of a little different.

00:59:22.490 --> 00:59:25.000
This is a structural
problem from hydrogen

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.335
modified aluminum fracture.

00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.930
OK.

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:34.680
The problem there is that
impurity embrittlement

00:59:34.680 --> 00:59:36.730
in metals is a big issue.

00:59:36.730 --> 00:59:41.520
There's a lot of metals whose
ductile behavior becomes very

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.160
poor when there's
impurity present,

00:59:44.160 --> 00:59:47.430
and hydrogen embrittlement
in particular is a bad one.

00:59:47.430 --> 00:59:48.930
And it's not that
hydrogen's so much

00:59:48.930 --> 00:59:51.480
worse than other impurities
but first of all,

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:55.240
hydrogen tends to be a common
impurity because it's available

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:55.740
everywhere.

00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:58.920
Any time you have corrosion
reactions going on,

00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:00.795
you often produce hydrogen.

01:00:00.795 --> 01:00:02.670
Any time you're working
in acid environments,

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:06.108
you produce hydrogen, and it
tends to be a fast diffuser.

01:00:06.108 --> 01:00:07.650
So there's a lot of
other impurities,

01:00:07.650 --> 01:00:09.442
but a lot of other
impurities sort of never

01:00:09.442 --> 01:00:11.670
make it to the problem
areas in the material

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:15.030
but hydrogen tends
to be a fast diffuser

01:00:15.030 --> 01:00:19.020
So the way people have dealt
with this in quantum mechanics

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:23.730
is literally by looking at
how planes decohere here

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:25.140
with and without hydrogen.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.060
And of course, if you
hydrogen in between it,

01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:28.810
it decoheres more easily.

01:00:28.810 --> 01:00:32.070
There's less work of decohesion.

01:00:32.070 --> 01:00:35.070
But if you want to look at
the structural problem of what

01:00:35.070 --> 01:00:41.955
happens when you do
this with hydrogen,

01:00:41.955 --> 01:00:43.580
if you want to
equilibrate the hydrogen

01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.230
it becomes a lot harder.

01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:46.730
So let me sort of
first tell you how

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.680
would you do this
without hydrogen.

01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:54.080
You could make a slab, you
would define a plane where

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:58.125
you open up the slab
and you remove the two

01:00:58.125 --> 01:00:59.750
slabs farther and
farther apart so it's

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:00.960
like you're opening a crack.

01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.418
You keep track of the energy
and the derivative of that is,

01:01:03.418 --> 01:01:06.543
of course, the force required
to separate the slab.

01:01:06.543 --> 01:01:08.210
But think of the
problem now if you want

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:10.850
to do that with an impurity.

01:01:10.850 --> 01:01:14.840
You have to now equilibrate the
impurity at every separation

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.510
of the slab.

01:01:16.510 --> 01:01:17.110
OK?

01:01:17.110 --> 01:01:21.310
So you pull the crack open
a little more, you now

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:23.560
have to figure out what
happens to that impurity

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:27.820
there because as that
impurity equilibrates,

01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:30.580
not only its structure
equilibrates by the way,

01:01:30.580 --> 01:01:34.210
but also its composition because
segregation to those surfaces

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:37.840
is an open system problem.

01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:39.790
The concentration
there is not fixed

01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:42.610
because it comes from the
bulk or from a gas phase.

01:01:42.610 --> 01:01:44.980
So it's actually a
grand canonical problem,

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.770
it's a constant chemical
potential problem rather than

01:01:47.770 --> 01:01:49.700
a constant composition problem.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:51.580
So you see that the
hard problem you have.

01:01:51.580 --> 01:01:53.920
Not only do you have to
arrange the impurities

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.020
in the most stable
way because that's

01:01:56.020 --> 01:01:58.390
going to determine the energy
and therefore the force

01:01:58.390 --> 01:02:01.570
it requires to open
up those planes,

01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:05.900
but you also need to equilibrate
the amount of impurity

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.370
in that crack.

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:10.970
And so this is actually why it's
so hard to include chemistry

01:02:10.970 --> 01:02:13.880
in mechanical calculations,
because you're really

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.680
working on two different
time scales that

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:17.630
are very hard to combine.

01:02:17.630 --> 01:02:20.990
And so the solution
here was essentially

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:26.360
to calculate the relevant
free energy of hydrogen

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:30.878
for any state of crack opening,
for any state of separation

01:02:30.878 --> 01:02:33.170
of the planes you tried to
get the equilibrium hydrogen

01:02:33.170 --> 01:02:36.020
content by a cluster
expansion and then

01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.660
from that envelope of free
energies you get the force.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.360
So it's again, the same thing.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:48.540
You define a lattice model.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:52.110
This was hydrogen on one
side of the crack opening,

01:02:52.110 --> 01:02:55.540
hydrogen sites on another
side of the crack opening.

01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.470
So now you have interactions
within one plane,

01:02:58.470 --> 01:03:02.100
but also between the two.

01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:04.870
You do a bunch of first
principles computations,

01:03:04.870 --> 01:03:08.130
so it's, again, the same thing
to fit those interactions.

01:03:08.130 --> 01:03:09.870
Then you're going
to do Monte Carlo.

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:12.270
You're going to, in this
case, get your free energies

01:03:12.270 --> 01:03:14.580
in the derivatives of the
free energy with respect

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.510
to the separation is
going to be the force.

01:03:19.290 --> 01:03:22.080
So in this case,
this is the force

01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.540
as a function of slab
separation for all

01:03:24.540 --> 01:03:27.820
the different
hydrogen coverages.

01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.770
So I plotted the force.

01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:32.912
I really should have plotted
the energy because the energy is

01:03:32.912 --> 01:03:34.120
the quantity that's expended.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:38.750
And then you get interactions.

01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:40.730
In this case, I'm
only showing two.

01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:44.060
So there's an in-plane
hydrogen interaction,

01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:47.060
that's the red one here,
and there's an inter-plane.

01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.000
The inter-plane is between
the two openings of the crack

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.920
and of course, that
one tends to go to 0

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.930
as you separate more and more.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:54.860
OK?

01:03:54.860 --> 01:03:58.220
So now the cool thing is
at every state of the crack

01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:02.540
opening, you can actually get
the free energy of the system

01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:04.430
fully equilibrated.

01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:07.670
And so if you get
the free energy,

01:04:07.670 --> 01:04:14.340
you can actually find
the force, and this

01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:17.460
is the fully equilibrated
thermodynamic trajectory,

01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.900
that red line.

01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:24.630
And what's really surprising
is that because you fully

01:04:24.630 --> 01:04:26.550
equilibrate the
system, it suddenly

01:04:26.550 --> 01:04:28.985
looks very different from
what you thought it would be

01:04:28.985 --> 01:04:30.360
and what you would
have gotten in

01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:32.730
an unequilibrated calculation.

01:04:32.730 --> 01:04:35.110
These black lines,
this is what you

01:04:35.110 --> 01:04:37.130
got in an unequilibrated
calculation.

01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:38.505
It sort of makes
sense, you know?

01:04:38.505 --> 01:04:41.010
As you pull, the force goes up.

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:42.330
No surprise, I mean.

01:04:42.330 --> 01:04:45.240
And then you reach
a critical point,

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.710
a point of maximum force.

01:04:46.710 --> 01:04:50.280
At that point, you're unstable
because essentially the force,

01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.920
as you pull further, goes
down so you're unstable.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.740
On the downslope you're
essentially unstable.

01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.980
But look at the red line.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.800
So this as a chemically
equilibrated system

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.390
behaves very different.

01:05:00.390 --> 01:05:04.290
Essentially you
pull a little bit,

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:06.360
you open the crack a
little bit, and then

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:11.380
the crack opens with
no increase in force.

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:11.880
OK?

01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:15.640
And then you pull the
saturated crack apart.

01:05:15.640 --> 01:05:18.567
And essentially what this
is is, because you've

01:05:18.567 --> 01:05:20.400
done your thermodynamics
right, you actually

01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:24.550
have a first order
transition in length space.

01:05:24.550 --> 01:05:31.320
OK, this is a length
discontinuity.

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:33.330
It's just like a
volume discontinuity

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:36.420
in a regular first
order transition, OK?

01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:42.530
Here, essentially the crack is
separating at constant force.

01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:43.700
OK?

01:05:43.700 --> 01:05:48.320
It's like when you do a
first order transition.

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.030
Upon heating, you're
putting an entropy

01:05:50.030 --> 01:05:52.520
at constant temperature
for example,

01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:57.170
or if you do a pressure
induced phase transition,

01:05:57.170 --> 01:05:59.840
you get a volume change
at constant pressure.

01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:00.500
OK?

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.760
So it's the same thing.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.470
But you see that by
doing the chemistry

01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:07.200
right and the equilibration,
you get very different results.

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:07.700
OK.

01:06:10.640 --> 01:06:17.330
So the last thing I want to
do is come back to the idea

01:06:17.330 --> 01:06:21.530
that we started with
and I wrote down

01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:25.330
the energy as a function
of configuration

01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:28.430
and and then showed you
how you cluster expended.

01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:31.100
What I want to do is
now come back again

01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.920
to what the definition
should be of that energy,

01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:38.183
and we did that at the back
end of the Monte Carlo lecture

01:06:38.183 --> 01:06:39.600
but because it's
kind of important

01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:44.160
I want to come back to it
because it's not totally clear

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:46.530
what that energy or that
Hamiltonian in the lattice

01:06:46.530 --> 01:06:48.595
model should be.

01:06:48.595 --> 01:06:50.970
So let me take a step back--
and I know you've seen this,

01:06:50.970 --> 01:06:53.010
but I'm going to go through it.

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:55.800
If you want to get the
free energy of a system

01:06:55.800 --> 01:07:00.405
you normally want to include all
excitations because essentially

01:07:00.405 --> 01:07:02.280
you have to calculate
the partition function,

01:07:02.280 --> 01:07:04.080
you have to trace
over all excitations,

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.240
and that will give you the
full partition function

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.800
and the [INAUDIBLE] will
give you the free energy.

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:13.810
So if you think of
the most basic system,

01:07:13.810 --> 01:07:17.080
we'll always have
vibrational excitations, OK?

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:20.602
If we have anything with a
binary problem like A's or B's

01:07:20.602 --> 01:07:22.060
or something and
vacancies, we will

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:24.580
have configurational
excitations,

01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:26.440
and then unless
you're in an insulator

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:29.740
you'll have electronic
excitations.

01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:32.080
The idea we talked
about last time

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:35.890
is that the way you can
define a Hamiltonian that

01:07:35.890 --> 01:07:38.560
lives in this space, which is
the one with the slower time

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:42.610
scale, is by integrating
over the faster timescale.

01:07:42.610 --> 01:07:45.130
And I started to
show you last time

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:51.530
I think when we finished
the Monte Carlo lecture.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:58.950
And let me sort of go through
that formal description

01:07:58.950 --> 01:08:02.910
again so we see exactly what
our latest model Hamiltonian is.

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:05.190
So I'm going to do it
here only with vibrations

01:08:05.190 --> 01:08:08.430
of the fast time scale
and substitutions

01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:10.140
as the slow timescale,
and after you'll

01:08:10.140 --> 01:08:13.480
see how it would go with
electronic excitations as well.

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:18.990
So I replace the coordinate ri,
so this is a set of coordinates

01:08:18.990 --> 01:08:23.609
that describe the atom,
into a lattice site

01:08:23.609 --> 01:08:27.559
position and a deviation
from that lattice site.

01:08:27.559 --> 01:08:28.439
OK?

01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:33.090
The lattice site
position, that is fully

01:08:33.090 --> 01:08:35.819
defined by the set of
configurational variable,

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:40.920
sigma, and the deviation from
the ideal lattice site position

01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:43.260
are called configuration nu.

01:08:43.260 --> 01:08:47.310
So the combination
of sigma and nu

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:51.670
is really the same as the
set of vectors ri, OK?

01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:56.545
So what I'm going to do is--

01:08:56.545 --> 01:08:58.670
you already see where I'm
going probably with this.

01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:01.729
I'm going to trace
over the nus to get

01:09:01.729 --> 01:09:02.915
a Hamiltonian in the sigmas.

01:09:06.149 --> 01:09:07.410
OK.

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:10.050
So the full
partition function is

01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:14.040
the sum of the exponential
of the energy, which

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.040
depends both on
sigma and nu, and I

01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:21.830
sum over the sigma
states and the nu states.

01:09:21.830 --> 01:09:22.359
OK?

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:27.240
What I'm going to do is I'm
going to do the inner sum

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:32.310
so that I'm only left with
the sum over sigmas of sum

01:09:32.310 --> 01:09:36.340
f, which is the Hamiltonian
in the configurational space.

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:39.660
And if you look to make
these to the same, what

01:09:39.660 --> 01:09:40.800
that f should be?

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:45.840
Well, f is the free energy that
I get by tracing over the nus.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:46.740
OK.

01:09:46.740 --> 01:09:48.960
I mean, there's no physics here.

01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:54.400
This is pure and simple
substitution of variables.

01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.390
So I call, essentially,
this sum here

01:09:57.390 --> 01:10:07.170
is the exponential
of minus beta f,

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:11.110
which means that f is the
log of that exponential.

01:10:11.110 --> 01:10:17.220
So look at what I
formally end up with.

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.950
I have a partition
function that only sums

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:22.300
over substitutional states.

01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:25.600
So this is a problem that lives
in the same space as a lattice

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:30.270
model because I'm only coming
over discrete configurational

01:10:30.270 --> 01:10:32.350
states.

01:10:32.350 --> 01:10:36.540
So what I'm really saying is
that if I do this partition

01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.998
function correctly, I have
the full partition function

01:10:38.998 --> 01:10:40.290
and therefore, the free energy.

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:45.290
But to do it correctly, my
Hamiltonian in my lattice model

01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:48.500
state needs to be f, not e.

01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.036
And what is that f?

01:10:50.036 --> 01:10:52.170
Well, f is essentially
a free energy.

01:10:52.170 --> 01:10:54.810
It's the log of a
partition function.

01:10:54.810 --> 01:10:56.640
And what partition
function is it?

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:58.980
It's the partition
function by summing over

01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:01.460
all the faster states.

01:11:01.460 --> 01:11:05.080
So the problem is,
essentially, simple.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:10.390
The Hamiltonian you should use
in your slow time scale space

01:11:10.390 --> 01:11:12.160
is the one you
get by integrating

01:11:12.160 --> 01:11:14.680
or by calculating the free
energy of your fast time

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:15.800
scales.

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:20.510
So in this case,
what should you do?

01:11:20.510 --> 01:11:22.700
In everything I showed
you earlier this morning,

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:25.710
I used the energy
as the Hamiltonian.

01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:26.210
OK?

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:30.050
I use the direct to DFT
energy in my Hamiltonian.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:33.620
What I really should have used
is the vibrational free energy

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.410
to be correct.

01:11:35.410 --> 01:11:38.730
If I use the vibrational free
energy in that Hamiltonian,

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:41.347
I would have gotten the
full partition function

01:11:41.347 --> 01:11:43.680
and therefore, I would have
gotten the total free energy

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.110
of the system.

01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:48.110
So what did I do instead?

01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:50.030
I didn't calculate this.

01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:54.110
I approximated
this by something.

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:57.290
I approximated this by
the state in this ensemble

01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:59.410
with the lowest energy.

01:11:59.410 --> 01:12:01.880
I mean, if you think of
this as a free energy,

01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.290
this is going to be a free
energy plus some entropy term,

01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:08.240
which you could think
of as a ground state

01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:13.110
energy plus contributions
from excited states.

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.610
OK?

01:12:13.610 --> 01:12:17.940
I've basically said, I'm taking
this just as the ground state

01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:22.900
energy in this
[? ensemble ?] because I'm

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:27.850
taking the lowest energy
configuration that I

01:12:27.850 --> 01:12:30.780
can get by varying over this.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.320
OK?

01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:33.420
And what is varying over this?

01:12:33.420 --> 01:12:34.170
What are the nus?

01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:36.690
The nus are the displacement
from the lattice sites.

01:12:36.690 --> 01:12:38.700
So essentially I'm
relaxing my system,

01:12:38.700 --> 01:12:40.890
letting it displace
from the lattice site,

01:12:40.890 --> 01:12:43.080
I get the lowest energy
state in the ensemble,

01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.350
and that's what I expend.

01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:49.410
So when I'm done,
what do I have?

01:12:49.410 --> 01:12:51.930
When I'm done and I do Monte
Carlo with that Hamiltonian,

01:12:51.930 --> 01:12:54.390
I have essentially
the right energetics,

01:12:54.390 --> 01:12:56.160
I have configuration
entropy, but I

01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.740
don't have vibrational entropy.

01:12:58.740 --> 01:13:01.920
To have vibrational entropy,
I would have to do this sum,

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:04.670
not just take the
lowest energy term.

01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:05.170
OK.

01:13:29.700 --> 01:13:30.200
Come on.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.760
OK, let me sort of skip that.

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:44.450
OK.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:50.640
People actually
have done examples

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.820
where they do the
full integration

01:13:53.820 --> 01:13:57.810
over vibrational states
rather than just approximating

01:13:57.810 --> 01:13:59.730
that ensemble with its
lowest energy term.

01:13:59.730 --> 01:14:02.040
You see that it's
a lot more work.

01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.920
Remember that to parameterize
the cluster expansion,

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:09.390
I need the Hamiltonian evaluated
for a bunch of configurations.

01:14:09.390 --> 01:14:14.260
Even in the simplest case that's
easily 40, 50 configurations.

01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:17.970
So if you want to
include the vibrations,

01:14:17.970 --> 01:14:21.780
you actually have to do, for 50
configurations, the full phonon

01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:26.040
DOS or do molecular dynamics on
them and integrate the phonon

01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.230
and get the vibrational
free energy through that.

01:14:28.230 --> 01:14:31.150
So it's like two orders
of magnitude more work.

01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:32.940
So rather than just
the energy, you

01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:34.740
want to get the whole
vibrational spectrum,

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.597
and that's why people
usually don't do it.

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:38.430
But the nice thing is
that in this approach,

01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:40.790
you can do it if
you really want to.

01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:43.290
And I'll show you one example
where people did it and looked

01:14:43.290 --> 01:14:44.380
at the difference.

01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:47.070
It was the very simple case
of the cadmium magnesium phase

01:14:47.070 --> 01:14:48.060
diagram.

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:52.630
It was done by Mark Asta,
who's now at Northwestern.

01:14:52.630 --> 01:14:56.000
So this is the experimental
phase diagram actually.

01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.840
So this is the calculation
with no vibrational entropy

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:01.650
and with vibrational entropy.

01:15:01.650 --> 01:15:04.250
So the first one is
the one that I sort of

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.660
showed you as the standard one.

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:08.720
You just take the lowest
energy for a lattice model

01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:11.580
configuration and you do
Monte Carlo then with that.

01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:14.180
And this is if you literally
do the whole phonon

01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:16.040
DOS for every configuration.

01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:18.800
And what you see is that there
is some change in topology.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.630
I mean, look at this point
has come down considerably

01:15:21.630 --> 01:15:25.430
and even has changed
the topology somewhat,

01:15:25.430 --> 01:15:28.970
and usually that's what you see.

01:15:28.970 --> 01:15:31.910
You rarely see new phases
new ground states come

01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:35.120
in when you include
vibrations, but you

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:38.600
will change the topology of
phase diagrams, for example.

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.130
There are a few known cases.

01:15:40.130 --> 01:15:42.410
Usually people write a
physical review letter

01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:44.570
whenever they find
one where phrases

01:15:44.570 --> 01:15:48.530
come in purely stabilized by
their vibrational entropy.

01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:50.130
It's a bit of a
puzzle, actually, why

01:15:50.130 --> 01:15:53.060
it doesn't happen more because
the vibrational entropy is

01:15:53.060 --> 01:15:54.440
large.

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.530
It's essentially 3r.

01:15:57.530 --> 01:16:00.440
Remember the law
of the [INAUDIBLE]??

01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:02.150
The entropy is 3rt.

01:16:02.150 --> 01:16:05.900
The [INAUDIBLE] is 3r,
so the entropy is 3rt.

01:16:05.900 --> 01:16:12.170
The configurational entropy at
its maximum is only r log 2.

01:16:12.170 --> 01:16:16.040
At 50-50, in a binary alloy,
you have the maximum entropy

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:19.880
and it's actually
the logarithm of 1/2,

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.100
so it's minus the
logarithm of 2.

01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:24.020
So you either have--

01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:26.340
that's about, what, 0.67?

01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:29.420
So the configurational
entropy only about 0.67r,

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:33.640
the vibration one is 3r,
so it's a lot bigger.

01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:36.370
But of course, what
matters is the difference

01:16:36.370 --> 01:16:38.530
in that quality between
different structures

01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:40.360
and different states.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.640
And even though the
configurational entropy

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:45.940
is the smaller one, it
tends to be the one that's

01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:49.300
more different between different
states than the vibration one,

01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:52.240
and that's why we
sort of all hope

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.170
that it's OK to often leave
the vibrational entropy out

01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:59.200
because often most
of it tends to cancel

01:16:59.200 --> 01:17:00.370
between different states.

01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:09.110
OK.

01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:13.910
So sometime in 1994, somebody
compiled all the systems

01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:15.290
done with these methods.

01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:17.330
This was 1994.

01:17:17.330 --> 01:17:20.360
We stopped compiling after '94
because that was just way too

01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:23.720
many studies going on,
but this kind of approach

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.090
has now been used for
the study hundreds

01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:28.850
and hundreds of
[INAUDIBLE] structure

01:17:28.850 --> 01:17:30.185
and thermodynamics problems.

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.600
People do higher
component now, ternary's

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:37.063
it's still a lot more work.

01:17:37.063 --> 01:17:38.105
This is a simple ternary.

01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.520
And then I gave you a
series of references.

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.160
I wanted to show you some of
the older work, that's actually

01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.870
the last references here.

01:17:48.870 --> 01:17:51.990
Often the older work, even
though it's not up to date,

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:56.380
but it's also not confused
by a lot of complications

01:17:56.380 --> 01:18:00.490
so it's often very easy to
read, very elegant to read.

01:18:00.490 --> 01:18:02.970
But the key review
paper is essentially

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:07.320
this one, which is like
150 pages or something

01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:11.700
like that which contains the
ideas of the cluster expansion

01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.750
and a lot more.

01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:19.600
And then my own work is just a
short review on how that works,

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.560
how you apply the [INAUDIBLE]
sites, and the one by Alexander

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.060
Zunger is essentially
the same thing

01:18:24.060 --> 01:18:27.070
but how you apply that
in semiconductors.

01:18:27.070 --> 01:18:30.130
And the fourth one is
the most recent one,

01:18:30.130 --> 01:18:33.450
which my own grad student
wrote, Axel Van de Walle,

01:18:33.450 --> 01:18:36.750
because he's been
kind of instrumental.

01:18:36.750 --> 01:18:39.450
He's gone to making this
into automated codes

01:18:39.450 --> 01:18:41.670
and so on, has a whole
code suite and the paper

01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:44.880
is about that, how
you train Monte Carlo

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.880
and so to automatically look
for phase transitions and things

01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.290
like that.

01:18:49.290 --> 01:18:50.730
OK.

01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:52.960
I think that's it.

01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:54.510
So let's see, what day's today?

01:18:54.510 --> 01:18:57.935
Today's Thursday, so Tuesday
we'll meet again here.

01:19:00.690 --> 01:19:04.170
I'll start talking about
accelerated molecular dynamics

01:19:04.170 --> 01:19:07.500
and find another topic
to talk about as well,

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.360
and then Thursday
is Chris Wolverton.

01:19:09.360 --> 01:19:11.500
So I'll see you,
have a good weekend.

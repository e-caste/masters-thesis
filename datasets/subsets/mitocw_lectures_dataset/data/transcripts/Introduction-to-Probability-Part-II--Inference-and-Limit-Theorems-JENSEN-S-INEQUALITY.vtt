00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.490
Let X be a random variable,
and let g be a function.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.090
We know that if g is linear,
then the expected value

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.070
of the function is the same
as that linear function

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.970
of the expected value.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.190
On the other hand, we know
that when g is nonlinear,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.910
in general, these two
quantities will not be related.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.340
But there is a
special case in which

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.730
we can establish some relation
between these two quantities

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.020
in the form of an inequality.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.440
This is Jensen's inequality,
which we're going to develop.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.020
Jensen's inequality
applies to the special case

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.800
where g is a convex function.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.140
I'm going to define
more precisely what it

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.710
means to be convex shortly.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.210
But in terms of a
picture, it's a function

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.570
that has a shape of this kind.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.770
So it tends to curve upwards.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.660
So let us look at
a simple example.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.660
Suppose that X is a
random variable that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.010
can take two values
with equal probability.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.080
So these two values have
both probability 1/2.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.050
And this is our
function, g of x.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:15.090
Since they take the two
values with equal probability,

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.190
the expected value is
going to be in the middle.

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.260
So this here is the
expected value of X.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.860
And in particular,
this value here

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.320
is going to be g of the
expected value of X. Now,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.070
the random variable g of
X will take this value

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.950
with probability
1/2, and it's going

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.390
to take that value
with probability 1/2.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.800
What is the average of g of X,
the expected value of g of X?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.350
It's going to be
1/2 of this value

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.440
plus 1/2 of this value, which
you can find as follows.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.850
If you draw a straight line,
it's going to be this much.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:10.320
So this quantity here is the
expected value of g of X.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.080
And we see that in this example,
the expected value of g of X

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.100
is above the value
of g evaluated

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.560
at the expected value of X.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.560
So this is what Jensen's
inequality says,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.579
but for a more
general distribution

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:33.960
for the random variable X. Let
us now step back and define

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.625
more precisely what it means
for a function to be convex.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.579
The most general definition
is the following.

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.990
If I take any two
points, x and y,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.200
and I take some number
p between 0 and 1.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.680
So in that case, the
number px plus 1 minus py

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.170
is a weighted
average of x and y--

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.660
so it's somewhere in the middle.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.960
And if I look at the
value of my function

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.470
at that particular
point-- so this value here

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.930
corresponds to
this-- this is less

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.120
than or equal to the weighted
average of the values of g

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.980
of x and g of y.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.750
So this is g of x.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.190
This is g of y.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:44.020
This value here is the weighted
average of the two values.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:51.780
So this quantity here is p times
g of x, which is this value,

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.840
plus 1 minus p, g of y.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.670
Convexity means that this
value is below that value.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.050
Or in other words, whenever I
take two points on this curve

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.760
and join them by a
segment, then the function

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.450
lies underneath that segment.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.160
This is one possible definition.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.250
Now, in terms of
a picture, we see

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.540
that a convex function
tends to curve upwards.

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.260
This means that the derivative
or the slope of the function

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.450
keeps increasing.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.440
An increasing slope means
that the second derivative

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.080
of that function
is non-negative.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.409
And that could be an alternative
definition of convexity.

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:42.330
It turns out that if you
have a function that's

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.836
twice differentiable, these
two definitions are equivalent.

00:04:47.836 --> 00:04:49.460
On the other hand,
the first definition

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.270
is a little more
general, because it also

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.890
applies to functions
that are not smooth.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:58.860
So for example, the
function absolute value of x

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.960
is a convex one.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.575
But it's not
differentiable at zero.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.010
Finally, there's another
way of defining convexity,

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.630
and it is the
following property,

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.170
again for differentiable
functions.

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.010
What it says is the following.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:27.910
If I fix a certain point,
c-- to use the same diagram

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.780
let's say that this
is c-- this value here

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.630
is going to be g of c.

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:40.610
I look at the derivative
of that function and take

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.690
this quantity, which is the
derivative times how far I

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:46.830
am going.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.290
This quantity here is a
first-order Taylor series

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:52.820
approximation of my function.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.320
So it corresponds
to this black line.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.460
What this condition says
is that the function

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.596
lies on top of that tangent
line to my function.

00:06:06.596 --> 00:06:11.950
It is not too difficult to
show that this condition,

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.370
non-negative second derivatives,
implies this condition.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.820
What you do is that you write
down the second order Taylor

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:22.220
approximation of
your function g.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.135
And then because the
second order term

00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:26.880
is going to be non-negative
because of that condition,

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.770
you're going to get an
inequality in this form.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.960
But in any case, this
inequality is pretty intuitive.

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.220
And we could take this
one just as our definition

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.700
of convexity-- that is,
a function is convex

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:41.520
if it has the property
that whenever I draw

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:44.970
a tangent to my curve,
the function lies

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:48.740
on top of this linear function.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.680
So now let's move
back to probability.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.750
Suppose that g is convex.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.190
This is true for every x.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.820
So in particular, if I
have my random variable,

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:08.710
capital X, no matter what
my random variable is,

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:22.750
we're going to get this kind
of inequality, no matter what.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:26.280
And here what I they
left blank is c.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.040
Now, c is a number.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.110
This is true for any number.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.020
So in particular, it's
true if I use as my number

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:46.610
the expected value of X.
So we have this inequality

00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.460
that's true now in terms
of random variables.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.220
No matter what capital X happens
to be, this will be valid.

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:58.100
And now let us take
expectations of both sides.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.550
What we obtain is that the
expected value of g of X

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:05.300
is larger than-- now,
this is a number,

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.160
so the expected
value of that number

00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:15.820
is the number itself plus the
expected value of this term.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.790
This quantity is a number.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:22.240
The expected value of X
minus the expected value of X

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:25.200
is equal to 0.

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.450
And we have established
this particular fact,

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.599
which is true for
any convex function.

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.520
So this is Jensen's inequality.

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:41.480
Let's apply it to some examples.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.890
Let's consider the
function g, which

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:48.690
is the quadratic function.

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.860
Clearly, this is
a convex function.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.700
It has this kind of shape.

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.810
And the second derivative of
this function is positive.

00:08:55.810 --> 00:08:58.800
That's another way
of verifying it.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.980
Jensen's inequality
is going to tell us

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:05.620
something about the
expected value of X squared.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:07.770
Now, for this
expectation, we already

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.970
know that this is equal to the
variance of X plus the square

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:15.310
of the expected value.

00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:18.150
And since the variance
is always non-negative,

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.210
we obtain this inequality.

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.280
This is consistent with
Jensen's inequality.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.720
Jensen's inequality tells
us that E of g of X,

00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.780
with g the quadratic
function, is

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:37.270
larger than or equal
to the square-- that

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:41.270
is, g of the expected value.

00:09:41.270 --> 00:09:43.480
So for the case of
the square function,

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.440
Jensen's inequality did
not tell us anything

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.800
that we didn't know.

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:51.180
But it's nice to confirm
that it is consistent.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.620
But we could use
Jensen's inequality

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.490
in another setting where the
answer might not be as obvious.

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.400
For example, take the
function X to the fourth.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.680
This is also a convex function.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:06.070
And Jensen's inequality
is going to tell us

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:12.510
that the fourth power of the
expected value is less than

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:17.555
or equal to the expected
value of X to the fourth.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:23.160
Another case of
a convex function

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.860
is the negative logarithm.

00:10:30.650 --> 00:10:33.370
Remember that the
logarithmic function

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:38.040
has a shape of this kind,
which curves the opposite way.

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.300
So it's called a
concave function.

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.910
But if you take the
negative of this function,

00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:47.820
then you're going to get
something that is convex.

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:50.010
So by applying
Jensen's inequality

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.400
to this setting,
what we obtain is

00:10:53.400 --> 00:11:02.020
that g, which is minus log
of the expected value of X,

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:12.860
is less than or equal to the
expected value of minus log X.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:18.230
And then we can remove the
minus signs from both sides.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:21.370
And that is going to
reverse the inequality.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:28.120
And we will obtain that the
logarithm of the expected value

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:38.190
of X is larger than or equal
to the expected value of log X.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:41.170
So in this case for the
logarithmic function,

00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:44.840
the inequality goes in
the opposite direction.

00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.320
The reason is that the
logarithmic function

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:51.800
is a concave function,
not a convex one.

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.560
And by arguing similar
to this example,

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.080
a concave function is the
negative of a convex function.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.200
And for concave functions,
Jensen's inequality still

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.800
holds, but the inequality
goes the opposite way.

00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.650
Jensen's inequality turns
out to be quite useful.

00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:12.010
In many cases, we
want to say something

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:14.180
about the expected
value of g of X,

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:17.661
and Jensen's inequality
allows us to do that.

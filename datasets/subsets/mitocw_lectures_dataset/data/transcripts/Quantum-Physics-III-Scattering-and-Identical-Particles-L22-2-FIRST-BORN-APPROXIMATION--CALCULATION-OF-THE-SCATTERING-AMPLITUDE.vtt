00:00:00.322 --> 00:00:01.780
PROFESSOR: What
are we going to do?

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.820
We're going to explore only
the first Born approximation.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.090
And the first Born
approximation corresponds

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.105
to just taking this part.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:25.350
So this would be the
first Born approximation.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.770
It corresponds to what
we were doing here.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.040
What did we do here?

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.040
Well, we're simplifying the
second term, the integral term,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.980
by using what the Green's
function looked like.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.260
We simplified this term.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.400
So all what we did
here was valuable,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.980
except that there's
one little difference.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.490
We-- in that Born
approximation, we

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.350
replaced the psi that
appears inside the integral

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.700
by the incident psi,
which is the psi in here.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.260
So we will do that
now to simplify

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.640
this quantity in the so-called
first Born approximation.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.060
When can we use it?

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.140
So, very good.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.440
So when is the
Born approximation

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.260
a good approximation?

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.980
Well, we are throwing
away terms, in general.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.200
When we're putting an expansion
of this form, we're saying, OK,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.690
we can set the wave function
equal to the free part

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.640
plus the interacting part.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.560
So we have the free part,
and it gave us this quantity.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.410
And the interacting part
gave us the second one.

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.640
So the Born
approximation is good

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.940
when sort of the
free Hamiltonian

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.510
dominates over the perturbation.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:11.210
So if a scattering center
has a finite-energy bump,

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.620
and you're sending things
with very high energy,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.390
the Born approximation
should be very good.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.230
It's a high-energy
approximation,

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.830
in which you are
basically saying

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.120
that inside the
integral, you can

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.950
replace the plane-incident
wave, because that dominates.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.540
That's not the whole solution.

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.630
The whole solution then
becomes the plane integral wave

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.820
plus the scattered wave.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.080
But the plane wave dominates
over the scattering process.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.160
So it should be
valid in high energy.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.760
It's better and better in
high-energy approximation.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.240
So we have it here.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.750
And let's, therefore,
clean it up.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.670
So if we call this equation
"equation A," we say,

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:17.420
back to A. The first Born
approximation, back to A.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:31.950
The first Born approximation
gives us psi of r equals

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.580
e to the i k i r.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:39.510
Now we put all the-- and
this is all the arrows.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.790
And we have here minus 1 over
4 pi, integral d cubed r prime,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:55.720
e to the minus i k n dot
r prime, u of r prime,

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:02.790
and e to the i k i dot r prime.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.320
All this multiplied by
e to the i k r over r.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.180
So let's put a few vectors here.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.459
That's it.

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:20.070
OK.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.850
So it's basically
this same thing here,

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.120
but now replacing the
incident wave here.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.840
That's the so-called
first Born approximation.

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.380
But now this is really good.

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:42.405
We can compare this with what we
usually called f theta of phi.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.740
The expression of our brackets
is the scattering amplitude

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.990
f theta phi.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.390
So here we have an answer.

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:04.860
f at wave number k of theta and
phi is equal to this integral.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:06.090
Let's write it out.

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:13.340
Minus 1 over 4 pi,
integral d cubed r prime.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.100
And now we will combine
the exponentials.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:21.940
Happily, the two exponentials
depend on r prime.

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.470
So it's a difference
of exponents,

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.930
and we will call it
e to the minus i,

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:44.410
capital-K vector dot
r prime, u of r prime,

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:55.340
where this capital-K
vector is equal--

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:56.480
I kept the sign--

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:05.430
k n minus-- this time we'll
enter with a minus in that k--

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:16.440
k i or k s, the scattering k,
minus the incident i vector.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.970
Remember, we defined
there, on that blackboard,

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.420
the scattered momentum
as k times the direction

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:30.420
of observation,
that unit vector.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:39.190
So in combining these two
exponentials into a single one,

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:42.960
we have this
capital-K vector that

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.660
is a pretty important vector.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.520
And now, this is a nice formula.

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:54.400
It kind of tells you story
that there are not many ways

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.460
to generate things
that are interesting.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.170
Here it says that f k,
the scattering amplitude,

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.480
as a function of theta and phi,
is nothing else than a Fourier

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:17.130
transform of the potential
evaluated at what we would

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.150
call the transfer momentum.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:26.960
So the scattering and bridges
are doing Fourier transforms

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.390
of the potential.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.470
Pretty nice.

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.070
Pretty pictorial way
of thinking about it.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:37.190
Fourier transforms
are functions of--

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.910
I think when people
look at this formula,

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:44.060
there's a little uneasiness,
because the angles don't

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.900
show up on the right side.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:49.350
You have theta and
phi on the left,

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:53.690
but I don't see a theta,
nor a phi, on the right.

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.492
So I think that has to
be always clarified.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:04.285
So for that, if you want to
use, really, theta and phi,

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:08.675
I think most people will assume
that k incident is indeed

00:08:08.675 --> 00:08:11.460
in the z-direction.

00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.360
z-direction.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.905
So here is k incident.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.640
And it has some length.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.810
k scattered has the same length.

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:28.290
It's made by the same wave
number k without any index,

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:32.590
but multiplied by
the unit vector n.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:36.390
As opposed to k incident,
that is the same k multiplied

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:38.650
by the unit z vector.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:43.770
So the scattered vector is
the vector in the direction

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.520
that you're looking at.

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.370
So this is k s.

00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.900
It's over here.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:09:00.870
And therefore this vector is the
one that has the phi and theta

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:03.120
directions.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.280
That is that vector.

00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.900
And the vector k is k
scattered minus k initial.

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:17.260
So the vector k is
the transfer vector--

00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:22.680
is the vector that takes
you from k initial to k

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:27.510
s, is the vector that
must be added to k initial

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:31.060
to give you the
scattered vector.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:34.100
So this vector,
capital vector K--

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.260
it's a little cluttered here.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:37.860
Let me put the z in here.

00:09:41.070 --> 00:09:46.970
That vector is over
there, and that vector

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:53.575
is a complicated vector, not so
easy to express in terms of k i

00:09:53.575 --> 00:09:57.270
and k s, because it
has a component down.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:01.560
But it has an angle phi as well.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:09.250
But one thing you can say about
this vector is its magnitude

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:14.060
is easily calculable, because
there is a triangle here

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:21.530
that we drew that has
k incident and k s.

00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:22.530
And here is k.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:26.640
So this has length
k, this has length k,

00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:34.260
and this has length capital K.
The triangle with angle theta.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:38.300
So if you drop a
vertical line, you

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:44.500
see that k is twice
this little piece, which

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:49.820
is little k sine theta over 2.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:59.240
So that's one way that
formula on the right-hand side

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.030
has the information of theta.

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:04.370
It also has the
information of phi,

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:10.760
because you also need phi
to determine the vector k.

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.880
So this is an
approximation, but look

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:19.040
how powerful approximations
are, in general, in physics.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.920
This approximation
is an approximation

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:25.540
for the scattering amplitude.

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:29.720
It-- first, it's a very nice
physical interpretation,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.560
in terms of a Fourier
transform of potential.

00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:36.910
Second, it gives
you answers even

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:41.570
in the case where the potential
is not spherically symmetric.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.890
You remember, when potentials
were spherically symmetric,

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.430
the scattering amplitude
didn't depend on phi,

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:50.770
and we could use partial waves.

00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:53.350
And that's a nice way
of solving things.

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:59.290
But here, at the expense
of not being exact,

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.730
we have been able to calculate
a scattering amplitude

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.620
when the potential is not
spherically symmetric.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:13.660
So you manage to go very
far with approximations.

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.170
You don't get the
exact things, but you

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:23.480
can go into results that
are a lot more powerful.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:30.170
So this is an explanation
of this formula.

00:12:30.170 --> 00:12:31.620
And we can use this formula.

00:12:31.620 --> 00:12:33.410
In fact, we'll do
a little example.

00:12:33.410 --> 00:12:36.560
And these are the
things that you still

00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:39.390
have to do a bit in
the homework as well.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:41.630
Many of them are in Griffiths.

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:45.590
And indeed,
technically speaking,

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:49.870
what you need to finish
for tomorrow hinges a bit

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:50.990
in what I'm saying.

00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:55.220
But the final formulas are
well written in Griffiths

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:59.330
explicitly, and in fact, half of
the problems are solved there.

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:03.190
So it shouldn't be so difficult.

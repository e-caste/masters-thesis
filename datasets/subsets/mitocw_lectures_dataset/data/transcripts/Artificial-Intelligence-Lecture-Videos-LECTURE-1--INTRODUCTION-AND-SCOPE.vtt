00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.190
PATRICK WINSTON: Welcome
to 6034.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.230
I don't know if I can deal
with this microphone.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.405
We'll see what happens.

00:00:29.405 --> 00:00:30.380
It's going to be a good year.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.530
We've got [INAUDIBLE] a bunch
of interesting people.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.790
It's always interesting to see
what people named their

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.820
children two decades ago.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.510
And I find they were overwhelmed
with Emilys.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.420
And there are not too many
Peters, Pauls, and Marys, but

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.540
enough to call forth a suitable
song at some point.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.630
We have lots of Jesses
of both genders.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.220
We have a [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.890
of both genders.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.810
And we have a Duncan,
where's Duncan?

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.080
There you are, Duncan.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.900
You've changed your hairstyle.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.130
I want to assure use that the
Thane of Cawdor is not taking

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.390
the course this semester.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.890
What I'm going to do is tell
you about artificial

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.680
intelligence today, and what
this subject is about.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.100
There's been about a 10% percent
turnover in the roster

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.320
in the last 24 hours.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.680
I expect another 10% turnover
in the next 24 hours, too.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.600
So I know many of you are
sightseers, wanting to know if

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.720
this is something
you want to do.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.140
So I'm going to tell you about
what we're going to do this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.229
semester, and what you'll know
when you get out of here.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.620
I'm going to walk you through
this outline.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.539
I'm going to start by talking
about what artificial

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:48.630
intelligence is, and
why we do it.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.160
And then I'll give you a little
bit of the history of

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.000
artificial intelligence, and
conclude with some of the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.570
covenants by which we
run the course.

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.140
One of which is no
laptops, please.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.620
I'll explain why we have these
covenants at the end.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.360
So what is it?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.220
Well, it must have something
to do with thinking.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.280
So let's start up here, a
definition of artificial

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:21.820
intelligence, by saying that
it's about thinking,

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.850
whatever that is.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.100
My definition of artificial
intelligence has

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.560
to be rather broad.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.710
So we're going to say it's
not only about thinking.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:39.110
It's also about perception,
and it's about action.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.060
And if this were a philosophy
class, then I'd stop right

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.120
there and just say, in this
subject we're going to talk

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.370
about problems involving
thinking,

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.860
perception, and action.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.890
But this is not a philosophy
class.

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.050
This a Course six class.

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.350
It's an engineering
school class.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.000
It's an MIT class.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.940
So we need more than that.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:12.380
And therefore we're going to
talk about models that are

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.329
targeted at thinking,
perception, and action.

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.800
And this should not be strange
to you, because model making

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.900
is what MIT is about.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.540
You run into someone at a bar,
or relative asks you what you

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.200
do at MIT, the right knee jerk
reaction is to say, we learned

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.130
how to build models.

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.990
That's what we do at MIT.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:40.570
We build the models using
differential equations.

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.450
We build models using
probabilities.

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.829
We build models using physical
and computational simulations.

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.300
Whatever we do, we
build models.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.710
Even in humanities class, MIT
approach is to make models

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.290
that we can use to explain the
past, predict the future,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.050
understand the subject,
and control the world.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.290
That's what MIT is about.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.400
And that's what this subject
is about, too.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.650
And now, our models are
models of thinking.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.060
So you might say,
if I take this

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.840
classic will I get smarter?

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.760
And the answer is yes.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.500
You will get smarter.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.980
Because you'll have better
models of your own thinking,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.120
not just the subject matter of
the subject, but better models

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.840
of your own thinking.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.370
So models targeted at thinking,

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.670
perception, and action.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.460
We know that's not quite enough,
because in order to

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.790
have a model, you have to
have representation.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.040
So let's say that artificial
intelligence is about

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:52.470
representations that support
the making of models to

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.040
facilitate an understanding
of thinking,

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.500
perception, and action.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.409
Now you might say to me, well
what's a representation?

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:00.170
And what good can it do?

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:02.780
So I'd like to take a brief
moment to tell you about

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.540
gyroscopes.

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.380
Many of you have friends in
mechanical engineering.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.980
One of the best ways embarrass
them is to say here's a

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.210
bicycle wheel.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:16.720
And if I spin it, and blow hard
on it right here, on the

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.110
edge of the wheel, is
going to turn over

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.160
this way or this way?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.250
I guarantee that what they will
do is they'll put their

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.400
hand in an arthritic posture
called the right hand screw

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.870
rule, aptly named because people
who use it tend to get

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.460
the right answer about
50% of the time.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.560
But we're never going to make
that mistake again.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.780
Because we're electrical
engineers,

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:46.820
not mechanical engineers.

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.300
And we know about
representation.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.290
What we're going to do is we're
going to think about it

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:52.486
a little bit.

00:05:52.486 --> 00:05:54.780
And we're going to use some
duct tape to help us think

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.730
about just one piece
of the wheel.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:01.270
So I want you to just think
about that piece of the wheel

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.050
as the wheel comes flying
over the top, and I

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:04.810
blow on it like that.

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.090
What's going to happen
to that one piece?

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.520
It's going to go off
that way, right?

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.400
And the next piece is going
to go off that way too.

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.610
So when it comes over, it
has to go that way.

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:19.440
Let me do some ground f
here just to be sure.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.450
It's very powerful feeling.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.730
Try it.

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.540
We need a demonstration.

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.010
I don't anybody think that
I'm cheating, here.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:39.840
So let's just twist it
one way or the other.

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.100
So that's powerful
pull, isn't it.

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:46.820
Alex is now never going to get
the gyroscope wrong, because

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.870
he's got the right
representation.

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:52.130
So much of what you're going to
accumulate in this subject

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:54.560
is a suite of representations
that will help you to build

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.990
programs that are intelligent.

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:00.330
But I want to give you a second
example, one a little

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:01.300
bit more computational.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.990
But one of which was very
familiar to you by the time

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:06.690
you went to first grade,
in most cases.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:09.610
It's the problem of the farmer,
the fox, the goose,

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.020
and the grain.

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.070
There's a river, a leaky rowboat
that can only carry

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.340
the farmer, and one of
his four possessions.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.080
So what's the right

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.220
representation for this problem?

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:24.370
It might be a picture
of the farmer.

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:29.570
It might be a poem about the
situation, perhaps a haiku.

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:33.240
We know that those are not
the right representation.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.340
Somehow, we get the sense that
the right representation most

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.440
involve something about the
location of the participants

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.270
in this scenario.

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:48.480
So we might draw a picture
that looks like this.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.150
There's the scenario, and
here in glorious green,

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:58.450
representing our algae infested
rivers is the river.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:05.306
And here's the farmer, the fox,
the goose, and the grain.

00:08:05.306 --> 00:08:07.900
An initial situation.

00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.743
Now there are other situations
like this one, for example.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.200
We have the river, and
the farmer, and the

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.590
goose is on that side.

00:08:21.590 --> 00:08:26.160
And the fox and the grain
is on that side.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:31.520
And we know that the farmer can
execute a movement from

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.929
one situation to another.

00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:36.980
So now we're getting somewhere
where with the problem.

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.120
This is at MIT approach
to the farmer, fox,

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.010
goose, and grain problem.

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.669
It might have stumped you when
you were a little kid.

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:46.870
How many such situations
are there?

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.632
What do you think, Tanya?

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:56.280
It looks to me like all four of
individuals can be on one

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.740
side or the other.

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.480
So for every position the farmer
can be, each of the

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.530
other things can be on either
side of the river.

00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:09.500
So it would be two to the fourth
she says aggressively

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.060
and without hesitation.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.020
Yes, two to the fourth,
16 possibilities.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:17.590
So we could actually draw
out the entire graph.

00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.770
It's small enough.

00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.620
There's another position over
here with the farmer, fox,

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:25.832
goose, and grain.

00:09:25.832 --> 00:09:28.560
And in fact that's
the one we want.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.660
And if we draw out the entire
graph, it looks like this.

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.250
This is a graph of the
situations and the allowed

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.960
connections between them.

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:47.280
Why are there not 16?

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.420
Because the other--

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:49.170
how many have I got?

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:49.625
Four?

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:51.720
10?

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.600
The others are situations in
which somebody gets eaten.

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.490
So we don't want to go to
any of those places.

00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.850
So having got the
representation, something

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:02.750
magical has happened.

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.030
We've got our constraints
exposed.

00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:19.860
And that's why we build
representations.

00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:23.080
That's whey you algebra in high
school, because algebraic

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.410
notation exposes the constraints
that make it

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:29.630
possible to actually figure out
how many customers you get

00:10:29.630 --> 00:10:31.510
for the number of advertisements
you place in

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:32.760
the newspaper.

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.870
So artificial intelligence is
about constraints exposed by

00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:39.760
representations that support
models targeted to thinking--

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.450
actually there's one
more thing, too.

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:42.800
Not quite done.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:48.500
Because after all, in the end,
we have to build programs.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:11:04.820
So it's about algorithms enabled
by constraints exposed

00:11:04.820 --> 00:11:09.510
by representations that model
targeted thinking, perception,

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:11.000
and action.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.520
So these algorithms, or we might
call them just as well

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.620
procedures, or we might call
them just as well methods,

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.030
whatever you like.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.980
These are the stuff of what
artificial intelligence is

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:24.860
about-- methods, algorithms,
representations.

00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.470
I'd like to give you
one more example.

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.570
It's something we call, in
artificial intelligence,

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:31.770
generated test.

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.640
And it's such a simple idea,
you'll never hear it again in

00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:34.840
this subject.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:37.130
But it's an idea you need to
add to your repertoire of

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:40.780
problem solving methods,
techniques, procedures, and

00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:42.900
algorithms.

00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:44.150
So here's how it works.

00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.370
Maybe I can explain to best by
starting off with an example.

00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:55.590
Here's a tree leaf I picked
off a tree on

00:11:55.590 --> 00:11:56.760
the way over to class.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:11:59.950
I hope it's not the last
of the species.

00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:01.540
What is it, what kind of tree?

00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:06.720
I don't know.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.870
I never did learn my trees,
or my colors, or my

00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:11.910
multiplication tables.

00:12:11.910 --> 00:12:17.060
So I have to go back to this
book, the Audubon Society

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:18.870
Field Guide to North
American Trees.

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:21.160
And how would I solve
the problem?

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:21.790
It's pretty simple.

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:26.490
I just turn the pages one at a
time, until I find something

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:28.700
that looks like this leaf.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:33.190
And then I discover it's a
sycamore, or something.

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:35.930
MIT's full of them.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:39.660
So when I do that, I do
something very intuitive, very

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:41.070
natural, something you
do all the time.

00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.550
But we're going to
give it a name.

00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:43.850
We're going to call it
generate and test.

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:59.790
And generate and test method
consists of generating some

00:12:59.790 --> 00:13:04.260
possible solutions, feeding
them into a box that tests

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:10.760
them, and then out the other
side comes mostly failures.

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:14.890
But every once in a while we
get something that succeeds

00:13:14.890 --> 00:13:17.240
and pleases us.

00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.960
That's what I did
with the leaf.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:21.340
But now you have
a name for it.

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:25.490
Once you have a name
for something, you

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:26.860
get power over it.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.970
You can start to
talk about it.

00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:32.180
So I can say, if you're doing
a generate and test approach

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:37.280
to a problem, you better build
a generator with certain

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.210
properties that make
generators good.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:42.940
For example, they should
not be redundant.

00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:46.210
They shouldn't give you the
same solution twice.

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.680
They should be informable.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.620
They should be able to absorb
information such as, this is a

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:53.650
deciduous tree.

00:13:53.650 --> 00:13:56.260
Don't bother looking
at the conifers.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:58.130
So once you have a name for
something, you can start

00:13:58.130 --> 00:13:59.370
talking about.

00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:02.580
And that vocabulary
gives you power.

00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.610
So we call this the
Rumpelstiltskin Principle

00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:10.530
perhaps The first of our
powerful ideas for the day.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.180
This subject is full
of powerful ideas.

00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.300
There will be some
in every class.

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.480
Rumpelstiltskin Principle says
that once you can name

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.250
something, you get
power over it.

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:19.220
You know what that little
thing is on

00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:20.470
the end of your shoelace?

00:14:23.650 --> 00:14:24.280
It's interesting.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.480
She's gesturing like mad.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.920
That's something we'll talk
about later, too--

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.070
motor stuff, and how
it helps us think.

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:33.310
What is it?

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.500
No one knows?

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.780
It's an ag something, right?

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.910
It's an aglet, very good.

00:14:38.910 --> 00:14:41.460
So once you have the name, you
can start to talk about.

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:44.320
You can say the purpose of an
aglet is pretty much like the

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.590
whipping on the end of a rope.

00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:48.140
It keeps the thing
from unwinding.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.140
Now you have a place to
hang that knowledge.

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.730
So we're talking about this
frequently from now into the

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.680
rest of the semester,
the power of being

00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:58.010
able to name things.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:01.850
Symbolic labels give us
power over concepts.

00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:04.290
While we're here I should also
say that this is a very simple

00:15:04.290 --> 00:15:06.570
idea, generate and test.

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.770
And you might be tempted to
say to someone, we learned

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.470
about generate and test today.

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.290
But it's a trivial idea.

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:17.030
The word trivial is a word I
would like you to purge from

00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:22.340
your vocabulary, because it's
a very dangerous label.

00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:25.970
The reason it's dangerous is
because there's a difference

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.360
between trivial and simple.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.310
What is it?

00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:33.320
What's the difference between
labeling something as trivial

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.570
and calling it simple?

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:35.820
Yes?

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.450
Exactly so.

00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:44.950
He says that simple can be
powerful, and trivial makes it

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:48.830
sound like it's not only simple,
but of little worth.

00:15:48.830 --> 00:15:53.060
So many MIT people miss
opportunities, because they

00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.270
have a tendency to think that
ideas aren't important unless

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.660
they're complicated.

00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:59.965
But the most simple ideas in
artificial intelligence are

00:15:59.965 --> 00:16:02.120
often the most powerful.

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:04.130
We could teach an artificial
intelligence course to you

00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:06.180
that would be so full of
mathematics it would make a

00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:09.150
Course 18 professor gag.

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:11.900
But those ideas would be
merely gratuitously

00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:15.590
complicated, and gratuitously
mathematical, and gratuitously

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:16.940
not simple.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.790
Simple ideas are often
the most powerful.

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.570
So where are we so far?

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.165
We talked about the
definition.

00:16:27.165 --> 00:16:29.660
We talked about an example
of a method.

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:32.560
Showed you a representation, and
perhaps also talked about

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.220
the first idea, too.

00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:36.690
You've got the representation
right, you're

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.440
often almost done.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:41.030
Because with this
representation, they can

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:44.580
immediately see that there are
just two solutions to this

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:48.930
problem, something that wouldn't
have occurred to us

00:16:48.930 --> 00:16:50.630
when we were little kids, and
didn't think to draw the

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:51.880
[? state ?] diagram.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.890
There's still one more thing.

00:17:01.410 --> 00:17:04.740
In the past, and in other
places, artificial

00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:09.108
intelligence is often taught
as purely about reasoning.

00:17:09.108 --> 00:17:12.515
But we solve problems with
our eyes, as well as

00:17:12.515 --> 00:17:15.420
our symbolic apparatus.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:18.858
And you solved that problem
with your eyes.

00:17:18.858 --> 00:17:22.839
So I like to reinforce that by
giving you a little puzzle.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:24.630
Let's see, who's here?

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.420
I don't see [? Kambe, ?] but
I'll bet he's from Africa.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.610
Is anyone from Africa?

00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:37.180
No one's from Africa?

00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.960
No?

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.210
Well so much the better--

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:47.760
because they would know the
answer to the puzzle.

00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.230
Here's the puzzle.

00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:53.270
How many countries in Africa
does the Equator cross?

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.290
Would anybody be willing
to stake their

00:17:58.290 --> 00:17:59.750
life on their answer?

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.770
Probably not.

00:18:06.910 --> 00:18:16.550
Well, now let me repeat
the question.

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.475
How many countries in Africa
does the Equator cross?

00:18:21.995 --> 00:18:23.040
Yeah, six.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.970
What happened is a miracle.

00:18:25.970 --> 00:18:29.770
The miracle is that I have
communicated with you through

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.660
language, and your language
system commanded your visual

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:38.590
system to execute a program that
involves scanning across

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:41.390
that line, counting as you go.

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:43.770
And then your vision system
came back to your language

00:18:43.770 --> 00:18:45.950
system and said, six.

00:18:45.950 --> 00:18:47.575
And that is a miracle.

00:18:47.575 --> 00:18:50.600
And without understanding that
miracle, we'll never have a

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.330
full understanding of the
nature of intelligence.

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:55.720
But that kind of problem solving
is the kind of problem

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.950
solving I wish we could teach
you a lot about it.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:00.420
But we can't teach you about
stuff we don't understand.

00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:01.500
We [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.750
for that.

00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.930
That's a little bit about the
definition and some examples.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:10.460
What's it for?

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.530
We can deal with that
very quickly.

00:19:12.530 --> 00:19:16.440
If we're engineers, it's for
building smarter programs.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.690
It's about building a tool kit
of representations and methods

00:19:20.690 --> 00:19:22.660
that make it possible to
build smarter programs.

00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.660
And you will find, these days,
that you can't build a big

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.520
system without having embedded
in it somewhere the ideas that

00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:31.230
we talk about in the subject.

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.420
If you're a scientist, there's
a somewhat different

00:19:33.420 --> 00:19:33.970
motivation.

00:19:33.970 --> 00:19:36.420
But it amounts to studying
the same sorts of things.

00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:40.800
If you're a scientist, you're
interested in what it is that

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:43.800
enables us to build a
computational account of

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.110
intelligence.

00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:46.910
That's the part that I do.

00:19:46.910 --> 00:19:49.620
But most this subject is going
to be about the other part,

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:52.440
the part that makes it possible
for you to build

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.510
smarter programs.

00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:56.990
And some of it will be about
what it is that makes us

00:19:56.990 --> 00:20:02.900
different from the chimpanzees
with whom we share an enormous

00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.130
fraction of our DNA.

00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:08.010
It used to be thought that we
share 95% of our DNA with

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:09.840
chimpanzees.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.660
Then it went up to 98.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.470
Thank God it stopped
about there.

00:20:15.470 --> 00:20:16.770
Then it actually went
back a little bit.

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:23.350
I think we're back down to 94.

00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:25.190
How about if we talk a little
bit now about the history of

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:28.940
AI, so we can see how we got
to where we are today?

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:31.040
This will also be a history of
AI that tells you a little bit

00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.420
about what you'll learn
in this course.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:42.730
It all started with Lady
Lovelace, the world's first

00:20:42.730 --> 00:20:47.750
programmer, Who wrote programs
about 100 years before there

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:50.500
were computers to run them.

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.140
But it's interesting that even
in 1842, people were hassling

00:20:54.140 --> 00:20:57.200
her about whether computers
could get really smart.

00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:03.370
And she said, "The analytical
engine has no pretensions to

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:05.500
originate anything.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:10.080
It can do whatever we know how
to order it to perform."

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.600
Screwball idea that persists
to this day.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.730
Nevertheless, that was
the origin of it all.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:17.330
That was the beginning
of the discussions.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:22.050
And then nothing much happened
until about 1950, when Alan

00:21:22.050 --> 00:21:24.110
Turing wrote his famous
paper, which

00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:27.090
introduced the Turing test.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:29.340
Of course, Alan Turing had
previously won the Second

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:34.090
World War by breaking the German
code, the Ultra Code,

00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.240
for which the British government
rewarded him by

00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.180
driving him to suicide, because
he happened to be

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:41.040
homosexual.

00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:44.260
But Turing wrote his paper in
1950, and that was the first

00:21:44.260 --> 00:21:48.720
milestone after Lady Lovelace's
comment in 1842.

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:53.140
And then the modern era really
began with a paper written by

00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.120
Marvin Minsky in 1960, titled
"Steps Toward Artificial

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:59.530
Intelligence." And it wasn't
a long after that Jim

00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.490
[? Slagle, ?]

00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:03.830
a nearly blind graduate student,
wrote a program that

00:22:03.830 --> 00:22:07.270
did symbolic integration.

00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.850
Not adding up area under a
curve, but doing symbolic

00:22:09.850 --> 00:22:11.870
integration just like you learn
to do in high school

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:14.470
when you're a freshman.

00:22:14.470 --> 00:22:16.560
Now on Monday, we're going to
talk about this program.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.730
And you're going to understand
exactly how it works.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:21.570
And you can write
one yourself.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:23.730
And we're going to reach way
back in time to look at that

00:22:23.730 --> 00:22:27.400
program because, in one day
discussing it, talking about

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.500
it, will be in itself a
miniature artificial

00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:30.360
intelligence course.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:35.250
Because it's so rich with
important ideas.

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:39.310
So that's the dawn age,
early dawn age.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:49.810
This was the age of speculation,
and this was the

00:22:49.810 --> 00:22:51.060
dawn age in here.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:57.600
So in that early dawn age , the
integration program took

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.390
the world by storm.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:00.280
Because not everybody knows
how to do integration.

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.580
And someone, everyone, thought
that if we can do integration

00:23:03.580 --> 00:23:05.420
today, the rest of intelligence
will be figured

00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.882
out tomorrow.

00:23:06.882 --> 00:23:10.580
Too bad for our side it didn't
work out that way.

00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:14.200
Here's another dawn age
program, the Eliza

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.220
[? thing ?].

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.590
But I imagine you'd prefer
a demonstration to

00:23:17.590 --> 00:23:19.455
just reading it, right?

00:23:19.455 --> 00:23:22.870
Do you prefer a demonstration?

00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:24.120
Let's see if we can
demonstrate it.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:11.400
This is left over from a
hamentashen debate of a couple

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:13.411
of years ago.

00:24:13.411 --> 00:24:15.050
How do you spell hamentashen,
anybody know?

00:24:19.450 --> 00:24:20.600
I sure hope that's right.

00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:21.390
It doesn't matter.

00:24:21.390 --> 00:24:22.640
Something interesting
will come.

00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:28.580
OK, your choice.

00:24:28.580 --> 00:24:31.310
Teal?

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:32.560
Burton House?

00:24:35.890 --> 00:24:37.140
Teal.

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:49.710
So that's dawn age AI.

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:53.700
And no one ever took that stuff
seriously, except that

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.900
it was a fun [INAUDIBLE]

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.980
project level thing to work
out some matching

00:24:57.980 --> 00:24:59.810
programs, and so on.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:01.310
The integration program
was serious.

00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:03.240
This one wasn't.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:06.940
This was serious, programs that
do geometric analogy,

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.020
problems of the kind you find
on intelligence tests.

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:09.990
Do you have the answer
to this?

00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:11.340
A is to B as C is to what?

00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:15.610
That would be 2, I guess.

00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:19.520
What's the second best answer?

00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:24.750
And the theories of the program
that solve these

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.990
problems are pretty much
identical to what you just

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:30.460
figured out.

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:35.970
In the first case you deleted
the inside figure.

00:25:35.970 --> 00:25:38.280
And the second case is, the
reason you got four is because

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:44.340
you deleted the outside part
and grew the inside part.

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:46.670
There's another one.

00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.510
I think this was the hardest one
it got, or the easiest one

00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:50.110
it didn't get.

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:51.300
I've forgotten.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.170
A is to B as C is to 3.

00:25:57.490 --> 00:26:00.180
In the late dawn age, we began
to turn our attention from

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.010
purely symbolic reasoning to
thinking a little bit about

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.600
perceptual apparatus.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.410
And programs were written that
could figure out the nature of

00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:11.800
shapes and forms,
such as that.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.200
And it's interesting that those
programs had the same

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:19.920
kind of difficulty with
this that you do.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.410
Because now, having deleted
all the edges, everything

00:26:22.410 --> 00:26:23.840
becomes ambiguous.

00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.790
And it may be a series of
platforms, or it may be a

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:27.615
series of--

00:26:27.615 --> 00:26:30.520
can you see the saw blade
sticking up if you go through

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:31.770
the reversal?

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:35.750
Programs were written that
could learn from a small

00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:37.600
number of examples.

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.490
Many people think of computer
learning as involving leading

00:26:41.490 --> 00:26:46.030
some neural net to submission
with thousands of trials.

00:26:46.030 --> 00:26:48.280
Programs were written in the
early dawn age that learned

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.980
that an arch is something that
has to have the flat part on

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.180
top, and the two sides can't
touch, and the top may or may

00:26:55.180 --> 00:26:56.430
not be a wedge.

00:26:59.630 --> 00:27:01.880
In the late dawn age, though,
the most important thing,

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:06.302
perhaps, was what you look at
with me on Wednesday next.

00:27:06.302 --> 00:27:09.120
It's a rule-based
expert systems.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.740
And a program was written at
Stanford that did diagnosis of

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:16.520
bacterial infections
of the blood.

00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:21.040
It turned out to do it better
than most doctors, most

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:22.860
general practitioners.

00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.990
It was never used,
curiously enough.

00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.360
Because nobody cares what your
problem actually is.

00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:33.420
They just give you a broad
spectrum antibiotic that'll

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.670
kill everything.

00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:39.700
But this late dawn age system,
the so-called [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:46.440
system, was the system that
launched a thousand companies,

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.960
because people started building
expert systems built

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.040
on that technology.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.130
Here's that you don't know
you used, or that was

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:53.430
used on your behalf.

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.570
If you go through, for example,
the Atlanta airport,

00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:59.380
your airplane is parked by a
rule-based expert system that

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:03.430
knows how to park aircraft
effectively.

00:28:03.430 --> 00:28:09.841
It saves Delta Airlines about
to $0.5 million a day of jet

00:28:09.841 --> 00:28:13.780
fuel by being all smarter
about how to park them.

00:28:13.780 --> 00:28:15.760
So that's an example of an
expert system that does a

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.160
little bit of good for
a lot of people.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.600
There's Deep Blue.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:27.930
That takes us to the next stage
beyond the age of expert

00:28:27.930 --> 00:28:30.410
systems, and the business age.

00:28:30.410 --> 00:28:33.250
It takes us into this age
here, which I call the

00:28:33.250 --> 00:28:43.260
bulldozer age, because this is
the time when people began to

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.390
see that we had at our disposal

00:28:46.390 --> 00:28:48.700
unlimited amounts of computing.

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.880
And frequently you can
substitute computing for

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.930
intelligence.

00:28:52.930 --> 00:28:56.420
So no one would say that Deep
Blue does anything like what a

00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.230
human chess master does.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:04.180
But nevertheless, Deep Blue,
by processing data like a

00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:06.700
bulldozer processes gravel,
was able to

00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:07.950
beat the world champion.

00:29:11.910 --> 00:29:13.100
So what's the right way?

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.390
That's the age we're
in right now.

00:29:15.390 --> 00:29:18.420
I will of course be inducing
programs for those ages as we

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.940
go through the subject.

00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.950
There is a question of what
age we're in right now.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:24.840
And it's always dangerous
to name an age when

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.640
you're in it, I guess.

00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:30.660
I like to call at the age
of the right way.

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:33.270
And this is an age when we begin
to realize that that

00:29:33.270 --> 00:29:36.750
definition up there is actually
a little incomplete,

00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:41.630
because much of our intelligence
has to do not

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:47.920
with thinking, perception, and
action acting separately, but

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:55.510
with loops that tie all
those together.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:57.490
We had one example
with Africa.

00:29:57.490 --> 00:30:02.270
Here's another example drawn
from a program that has been

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:04.960
under development, and continues
to be, in my

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.210
laboratory.

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:13.500
We're going to ask the system
to imagine something.

00:30:18.670 --> 00:30:19.610
SYSTEM: OK.

00:30:19.610 --> 00:30:22.406
I will imagine that a ball
falls into a bowl.

00:30:33.098 --> 00:30:33.584
OK.

00:30:33.584 --> 00:30:38.930
I will imagine that a man
runs into a woman.

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:40.240
PATRICK WINSTON: You see, it
does the best that it can if

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:43.440
it doesn't have a good memory
of what these situations

00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:45.005
actually involve.

00:30:45.005 --> 00:30:48.130
But having imagined the
scene it can then--

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:48.620
SYSTEM: Yes.

00:30:48.620 --> 00:30:52.110
I have learned from experience
that contact between a man and

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:56.240
a woman appeared because a
man runs into a woman.

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.110
PATRICK WINSTON: Having imagined
the scene, it can

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:01.740
then read the answers using its
visual apparatus on the

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.580
scene that it imagined.

00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.530
So just like what you did with
Africa, only now it's working

00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:08.790
with its own visual memory,
using visual programs.

00:31:12.026 --> 00:31:12.507
SYSTEM: OK.

00:31:12.507 --> 00:31:17.330
I will imagine that a man
gives a ball to a man.

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:21.050
PATRICK WINSTON: I know this
looks like slugs, but they're

00:31:21.050 --> 00:31:22.300
actually distinguished
professors.

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:27.750
It always does the
best it can.

00:31:30.465 --> 00:31:31.451
SYSTEM: OK.

00:31:31.451 --> 00:31:33.600
I will imagine that
a man flies.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.480
PATRICK WINSTON: It's the
best that it can do.

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:51.920
So that concludes our discussion
of the history.

00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.240
And I've provided you with a
little bit of a glimpse of

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:57.880
what we're going to look at
as the semester unfolds.

00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.410
Yes, Chris?

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.880
CHRIS: Is it actually a
demonstration of something?

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.200
Does it have a large
database of videos?

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.676
PATRICK WINSTON: No, it has
a small database videos.

00:32:08.676 --> 00:32:13.480
CHRIS: But it's intelligently
picking among them based on--

00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.140
PATRICK WINSTON: Based
on their content.

00:32:16.140 --> 00:32:20.570
So if you say imagine that a
student gave a ball to another

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:23.170
student, it imagines that.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:26.430
You say, now does the other
student have the ball?

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:27.590
Does the other student
take the ball?

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:30.030
It can answer those questions
because it can review the same

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:33.250
video and see the take as well
as the give in the same video.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:42.840
So now we have to think about
why we ought to be optimistic

00:32:42.840 --> 00:32:44.460
about the future.

00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:47.210
Because we've had a long history
here, and we haven't

00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:48.830
solved the problem.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:51.350
But one reason why we can feel
optimistic about future is

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.580
because all of our friends
have been on the march.

00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:57.950
And our friends include the
cognitive psychologists, the

00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:58.930
[? developmental ?]

00:32:58.930 --> 00:33:02.200
psychologists, the linguists,
sometimes the philosophers,

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.450
and especially the
paleoanthropologists.

00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:09.430
Because it is becoming
increasingly clear why we're

00:33:09.430 --> 00:33:12.780
actually different from the
chimpanzees, and how we got to

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.690
be that way.

00:33:14.690 --> 00:33:19.910
The high school idea is that
we evolved through slow,

00:33:19.910 --> 00:33:23.540
gradual, and continuous
improvement.

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:25.730
But that doesn't seem to
be the way it happened.

00:33:25.730 --> 00:33:30.210
There are some characteristics
of our species that are

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:34.010
informative when it comes to
guiding the activities of

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.120
people like me.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.950
And here's what the
story seems to be

00:33:37.950 --> 00:33:40.600
from the fossil record.

00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:45.330
First of all, we humans have
been around for maybe 200,000

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:49.210
years in our present
anatomical form.

00:33:49.210 --> 00:33:53.140
If someone walked through the
door right now from 200,000

00:33:53.140 --> 00:34:00.990
years ago, I imagine they
would be dirty,

00:34:00.990 --> 00:34:03.750
but other than that--

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.100
probably naked, too--

00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.070
other than that, you wouldn't
be able to tell the

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.320
difference, especially at MIT.

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:21.900
And so the ensuing 150,000 years
was a period in which we

00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:25.159
humans didn't actually
amount to much.

00:34:25.159 --> 00:34:30.070
But somehow, shortly before
50,000 years ago, some small

00:34:30.070 --> 00:34:34.500
group of us developed a
capability that separated us

00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:37.520
from all other species.

00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:40.409
It was an accident
of evolution.

00:34:40.409 --> 00:34:43.310
And these accidents may or may
not happen, but it happened to

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:45.199
produce us.

00:34:45.199 --> 00:34:47.920
It's also the case that we
probably necked down as a

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.600
species to a few thousand, or
maybe even a few hundred

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.219
individuals, something which
made these accidental changes,

00:34:55.219 --> 00:34:57.210
accidental evolutionary
products,

00:34:57.210 --> 00:35:00.500
more capable of sticking.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.820
This leads us to speculate on
what it was that happened

00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.750
50,000 years ago.

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:10.520
And paleoanthropologists, Noam
Chomsky, a lot of people

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.580
reached similar conclusions.

00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.050
And that conclusion is--

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:16.700
I'll quote Chomsky.

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.990
He's the voice of authority.

00:35:18.990 --> 00:35:22.020
"It seems that shortly before
50,000 years ago, some small

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.040
group of us acquired the ability
to take two concepts,

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.020
and combine them to make a
third concept, without

00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:33.540
disturbing the original two
concepts, without limit." And

00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:37.110
from a perspective of an AI
person like me, what Chomsky

00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:39.490
seems to be saying is, we
learned how to begin to

00:35:39.490 --> 00:35:42.270
describe things, in a way
that was intimately

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:43.790
connected with language.

00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:46.360
And that, in the end, is what
separates us from the

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:49.150
chimpanzees.

00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:50.790
So you might say, well let's
just study language.

00:35:50.790 --> 00:35:53.580
No, you can't do that, because
we think with our eyes.

00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:55.510
So language does two things.

00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:57.790
Number one, it enables us
to make descriptions.

00:35:57.790 --> 00:36:00.040
Descriptions enable us
to tell stories.

00:36:00.040 --> 00:36:02.400
And storytelling and story
understanding is what all of

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.730
education is about.

00:36:03.730 --> 00:36:04.810
That's going up.

00:36:04.810 --> 00:36:09.370
And going down enables us to
marshal the resources of our

00:36:09.370 --> 00:36:12.950
perceptual systems, and even
command our perceptual systems

00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:17.450
to imagine things we've
never seen.

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:20.120
So here's an example.

00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:22.420
Imagine running down
the street with a

00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.640
full bucket of water.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.890
What happens?

00:36:27.810 --> 00:36:29.100
Your leg gets wet.

00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.780
The water sloshes out.

00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:34.600
You'll never find that fact
anywhere on the web.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:37.470
You've probably never been told
that that's what happens

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.910
when you run down the street
with a full bucket of water.

00:36:39.910 --> 00:36:43.400
But you easily imagine this
scenario, and you know what's

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:43.990
going to happen.

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:47.150
There was internal imagination
simulation.

00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:49.030
We're never going to understand
human intelligence

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.670
until we can understand that.

00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.540
Here's another example.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:53.670
Imagine running down
the street with a

00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:55.620
full bucket of nickels?

00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:56.870
What happens?

00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.415
Nickels weigh a lot.

00:37:00.415 --> 00:37:01.395
You're going to be bent over.

00:37:01.395 --> 00:37:03.850
You're going to stagger.

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:05.690
But nobody ever told you that.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:08.080
You won't find it anywhere
on the web.

00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:10.720
So language is at the center of
things because it enables

00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.380
storytelling going up, and
marshalling the resources of

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:18.240
the perceptual apparatus,
going down.

00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:20.950
And that's where we're going
to finish the subject the

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:23.320
semester, by trying to
understand more about that

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:25.950
phenomenon.

00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:28.150
So that concludes everything
I wanted to say about the

00:37:28.150 --> 00:37:30.520
material and the subject.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:32.290
Now I want to turn my attention
a little bit to how

00:37:32.290 --> 00:37:34.090
we are going to operate
the subject.

00:37:34.090 --> 00:37:36.915
Because there are many
characteristics of the subject

00:37:36.915 --> 00:37:38.715
that are confusing.

00:37:43.610 --> 00:37:46.840
First of all, we have
four kinds of

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.180
activities in the course.

00:38:17.930 --> 00:38:22.870
And each of these has
a different purpose.

00:38:39.580 --> 00:38:40.850
So I did the lectures.

00:38:40.850 --> 00:38:43.910
And the lectures are supposed
to be an hour about

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:46.740
introducing the material
and the big picture.

00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:48.880
They're about powerful ideas.

00:38:52.138 --> 00:38:56.060
They're about the experience
side of the course.

00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:59.130
Let me step aside and
make a remark.

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.390
MIT is about two things.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:06.200
It's about skill building,
and it's about big ideas.

00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.120
So you can build a skill at
home, or at Dartmouth, or at

00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:13.830
Harvard, or Princeton, or all
those kinds of places.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.280
But the experience you
can only get at MIT.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.000
I know everybody there is
to know in artificial

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:18.940
intelligence.

00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:20.190
I can tell you about
how they think.

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:21.250
I can tell you about
how I think.

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.620
And that's something
you're not going to

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:25.120
get any other place.

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.640
So that's my role, as I see it,
in giving these lectures.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:34.160
Recitations are four buttressing
and expanding on

00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.430
the material, and providing a
venue that's small enough for

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:38.680
discussion.

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.200
Mega recitations are
[? a usual ?]

00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:43.380
components of the course.

00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.230
They're taught at the same
hour on Fridays.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:48.100
Mark Seifter, my graduate
student,

00:39:48.100 --> 00:39:49.510
will be teaching those.

00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:53.140
And those are wrapped around
past quiz problems.

00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:55.700
And Mark will show you
how to work them.

00:39:55.700 --> 00:40:00.050
It's very important component
to the subject.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.400
And finally the tutorials
are about helping

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.890
you with the homework.

00:40:04.890 --> 00:40:09.160
So you might say to me,
well, do I really

00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.590
need to go to class?

00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:15.170
I like to say that the answer
is, only if you like to pass

00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:17.870
the subject.

00:40:17.870 --> 00:40:19.920
But you are MIT students.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.190
And MIT people always like
to look at the data.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:29.640
So this is a scattergram we
made after the subject was

00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:33.010
taught last fall, which shows
the relationship between

00:40:33.010 --> 00:40:38.680
attendance at lectures and the
grades awarded in the course.

00:40:38.680 --> 00:40:40.820
And if you're not sure what
that all means, here's the

00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:42.070
regression line.

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:50.400
So that information is a
little suspect for two

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:55.520
reasons, one of which is we
asked people to self report on

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.330
how many lectures they thought
they attended.

00:40:58.330 --> 00:41:02.340
And our mechanism for assigning
these numerical

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.590
grades is a little weird.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.470
And there's a third thing, too,
and that is, one must

00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:12.860
never confuse correlation
with cause.

00:41:12.860 --> 00:41:15.150
You can think of other
explanations for why that

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:21.230
trend line goes up, different
from whether it has something

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:25.840
to do with lectures producing
good grades.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.070
You might ask how I feel about
the people up there on the

00:41:28.070 --> 00:41:30.580
other upper left hand corner.

00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:32.970
There are one or two people who
were near the top of the

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:37.190
subject who didn't go
to class at all.

00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.890
And I have mixed feelings
about that.

00:41:40.890 --> 00:41:41.550
You're adults.

00:41:41.550 --> 00:41:43.460
It's your call.

00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:46.490
On the other hand, I wish that
if that's what you do

00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:49.780
habitually in all the subjects
you take at MIT, that you

00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.450
would resign and go somewhere
else, and let somebody else

00:41:52.450 --> 00:41:53.780
take their slot.

00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:57.050
Because you're not benefiting
from the powerful ideas, and

00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:58.930
the other kinds of things
that involve

00:41:58.930 --> 00:42:01.150
interaction with faculty.

00:42:01.150 --> 00:42:02.350
So it can be done.

00:42:02.350 --> 00:42:03.310
But I don't recommend it.

00:42:03.310 --> 00:42:06.970
By the way, all of the four
activities that we have here

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:08.440
show similar regression lines.

00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.930
But what about that
five point scale?

00:42:12.930 --> 00:42:14.940
Let me explain how that
works to you.

00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:18.060
We love to have people
ask us what the class

00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:20.430
average is on a quiz.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.480
Because that's when we get
to use our blank stare.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:26.180
Because we have no idea
what the class average

00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:28.740
ever is on any quiz.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:29.990
Here's what we do.

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:48.660
Like everybody else, we
start off with a score

00:42:48.660 --> 00:42:50.680
from zero to 100.

00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:54.750
But then we say to ourselves,
what score would you get if

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:57.260
you had a thorough understanding
of the material?

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.400
And we say, well, for this
particular exam, it's this

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.480
number right here.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.630
And what score would you
get if you had a good

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:05.500
understanding of the material?

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.340
That's that score.

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:10.040
And what happens if you're
down here is that you're

00:43:10.040 --> 00:43:12.670
following off the edge of the
range in which we think you

00:43:12.670 --> 00:43:14.940
need to do more work.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.830
So what we do is, we say that if
you're in this range here--

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:21.520
following MIT convention
with GPAs and stuff,

00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:23.440
that gets you a five.

00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.300
If you're in this range
down here, there's a

00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:28.170
sharp drop off to four.

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:29.710
If you're in this range
down here, there's a

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:33.070
sharp fall off to three.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:34.950
So that means if you're in the
middle of one of those

00:43:34.950 --> 00:43:37.790
plateaus there's no point
in arguing with this.

00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:40.550
Because it's not going
to do you any good.

00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:43.020
We have these boundaries where
we think performance break

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.430
points are.

00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.870
So you say, well that seems
a little harsh.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.850
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
and start arguing.

00:43:49.850 --> 00:43:53.560
But then we will come back with
a second major innovation

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.860
we have in the course.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:44:00.300
That is that your grade is
calculated in several parts.

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:06.970
Part one is the max of
your grade on Q1, and

00:44:06.970 --> 00:44:09.830
part one of the final.

00:44:09.830 --> 00:44:12.780
So in other words, you get
two shots at everything.

00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:18.080
So if you have complete glorious
undeniable horrible F

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.540
on the first quiz, it gets
erased on the final if you do

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.910
well on that part
of the final.

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:25.590
So each quiz has
a corresponding

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.080
mirror on the final.

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:32.680
You get the max of the score you
got on those two pieces.

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.540
And now you say to me,
I'm an MIT student.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:38.066
I have a lot of guts.

00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:39.740
I'm only going to
take the final.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:46.060
It has been done.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:49.400
We don't recommend it.

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.970
And the reason we don't
recommend it is that we don't

00:44:51.970 --> 00:44:53.730
expect everybody to do
all of the final.

00:44:53.730 --> 00:44:55.740
So there would be a lot of time
pressure if you had to do

00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:00.200
all of the final, all five
parts of the final.

00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:02.890
So we have four quizzes.

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:05.590
And the final has a fifth part
because there's some material

00:45:05.590 --> 00:45:08.710
that we teach you after the last
date on which we can give

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:11.010
you a final by institute
rules.

00:45:11.010 --> 00:45:12.050
But that's roughly
how it works.

00:45:12.050 --> 00:45:16.690
And you can read about more of
the details in the FAQ on the

00:45:16.690 --> 00:45:17.940
subject homepage.

00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:21.050
So now we're almost done.

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:24.190
I just want to talk a little bit
about how we're going to

00:45:24.190 --> 00:45:27.840
communicate with you in the
next few days, while we're

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.710
getting ourselves organized.

00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:32.560
So, number one-- if I could ask
the TAs to help me pass

00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:34.570
these out--

00:45:34.570 --> 00:45:37.890
we need to schedule you
into tutorials.

00:45:37.890 --> 00:45:39.970
So we're going to ask you to
fill out this form, and give

00:45:39.970 --> 00:45:41.220
it to us before you leave.

00:45:44.250 --> 00:45:48.910
So you'll be hearing from
us once we do the sort.

00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:58.100
There's the issue of whether
we're going to have ordinary

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.500
recitation and a mega recitation
this week.

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.460
So pay attention.

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.630
Otherwise, you're going to be
stranded in a classroom with

00:46:03.630 --> 00:46:04.990
nothing to do.

00:46:04.990 --> 00:46:07.450
We're not going to have any
regular recitations this week.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.410
Are we having regular recitation
this week,

00:46:11.410 --> 00:46:11.720
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:14.270
No.

00:46:14.270 --> 00:46:19.890
We may, and probably will, have
a mega recitation this

00:46:19.890 --> 00:46:24.480
week that's devoted to
a Python review.

00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.810
Now we know that there are
many of you who are

00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:31.250
celebrating a religious holiday
on Friday, and so we

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:34.680
will be putting a lot of
resources online so you can

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:38.060
get that review in
another way.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:42.740
We probably will have a Python
review on Friday.

00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:45.640
And we ask that you look at
our home page for further

00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:49.520
information about that as
the week progresses.

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:50.640
So that's all folks.

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:52.470
That concludes what we're
going to do today.

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:56.750
And as soon as you give us
your form, we're through.

WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So class
1 as you all will recall

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.960
was about direct
innovation factors.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.550
And we looked at the growth
economists, Solow and Romer

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.270
in particular.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.050
And they essentially gave us
two direct innovation factors

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.830
that you really can't account
for in an innovation system

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.270
unless those are inputs.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.680
So what we could
translate Solow as saying,

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:54.080
you need to do R&D. And we
can translate Romer as saying,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.660
you need to--

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.610
it's the talent in
the system that's

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.150
working in this system
that's a critical input.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.550
So that gives us our first
two innovation factors.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.000
Class 2 brought us our third.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.080
And we began to consider
innovation as not just factors,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.790
but as a system.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.580
And Liz Reynolds' discussion
earlier this afternoon

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.520
was a good reminder of a
systems approach to innovation.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.820
So we read Richard
Nelson, and he

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.978
introduced the idea of looking
at national innovation systems.

00:01:29.978 --> 00:01:31.520
He wasn't the first
to use that term.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.228
Chris Freeman at the
University of Sussex

00:01:33.228 --> 00:01:36.590
was, but he really
explored the dimensions

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.660
and taught us to look
at the innovation

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.890
institutions and the
strengths and weaknesses

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.750
of those institutions.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.670
And with that
concept then, you can

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.180
begin to explore any
innovation system.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.320
Our third direct
innovation factor,

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.050
then, is really all about
innovation organization.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.900
The strength of the actors, the
connections between the actors,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.220
and then the gaps in
that innovation system.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.350
You can analyze all of
those and understand a lot

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.570
about the strength of a
particular innovation system,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.460
whether it's national,
whether it's regional,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.110
whether it's local.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.380
And Liz gave you a
reading of her study

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.880
of the state of
Massachusetts, which

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.570
is a good glimpse
into those issues.

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.900
So classes 3 and 4 I
won't recap because Liz

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.760
gave us a good reminder
of those issues.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.300
But we studied manufacturing,
and how it evolved

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.410
in two different periods--

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.890
both the 1980s competition
period and the current decline

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.350
of US manufacturing in the
first decade of this century,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.510
the early 2000s.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.660
And that was a good
case study for us

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.540
on how to take these
ideas of innovation system

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.620
and look at a system,
the manufacturing system.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.820
Class 5 pulled back and
got us into the framework

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:59.360
again, looking at innovation
at the institutional level.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.870
How does R and D and
prototype, how do those stages

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.890
operate in innovation
organizations, R

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.190
and D organizations?

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.690
And then, how does
the handoff occur

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.023
in an innovation system and
the strength of those actors

00:03:14.023 --> 00:03:15.110
as well?

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.530
So that got us into thinking
about looking at innovation

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.270
at the institutional level.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.690
Class number six was about
the Valley of Death problem.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.740
The gap that was in effect
built in into the US innovation

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:32.540
system because we focused
the federal role on research,

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.240
it didn't really focus on
the follow-on later stage

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.580
development in
subsequent stages, right?

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.640
So it guaranteed a gap
between our innovation actors,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.940
between the research world
and the implementation world.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:54.620
And we talked about innovation
at the face-to-face level.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.970
So innovation doesn't just occur
at the institutional level,

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.150
it occurs amongst people.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.910
People innovate,
not institutions.

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.280
Institutions help organize
an innovation system,

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.810
but in the end it's people.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.370
And what are the rule sets that
govern the way innovation looks

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.590
like at the face-to-face level?

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.279
And we got deeply into
great group theory.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.200
Class number 8 was
about DARPA, which

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.870
is a very different innovation
model than the bulk of the US

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:25.697
system, organized around--

00:04:25.697 --> 00:04:28.280
predominately around they end
of the World War II time period.

00:04:30.853 --> 00:04:32.270
It's an organization
that attempts

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.260
to combine capabilities at
both the institutional level,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.130
but also the great
group forming innovation

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.720
at the face-to-face level.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.430
Working on
breakthrough technology

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.603
is what DARPA calls
a right/left model.

00:04:45.603 --> 00:04:47.270
It wants to think
about what it gets out

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.080
of the end of the
innovation system.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.460
It's not just curiosity-driven.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.590
So what do they
want, and then how

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.630
to go back to the early
stages and develop

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.730
the breakthroughs to get there?

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.490
So a very different
organizational model.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.840
Class 9 was a case study on NIH.

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.550
And again it brought
home to us how

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.420
to look at an innovation
system, in this case,

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.630
in the life science
research world.

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.190
And what are the institutional
barriers and problems

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.660
in that system?

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:22.750
Class 10 was around
energy technology,

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.160
we introduced the idea of
the difficulty of innovating

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.130
in a legacy economic sector--

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.520
and established,
complex, existing legacy

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.690
sector that builds up its
own paradigm to protect

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:40.350
its models that
are technological,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:43.900
they are economic, they are
political, they are social.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.720
And they build barriers
to disruptive threats

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.300
from the outside,
from new entrants

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.670
that would attempt to
disrupt that model.

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.235
And how do you begin to think
about bringing innovation

00:05:54.235 --> 00:05:57.373
into these legacy sectors is
a really important question,

00:05:57.373 --> 00:05:59.290
because most of the
economy is legacy sectors.

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:03.190
And if you're walling off
80% or more of your economy

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.770
from innovation, then you're
going to dramatically affect

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.200
your ability to grow,
and your growth rate,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:09.700
and your societal well-being.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:13.960
So in effect that's the
problem with legacy sectors,

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:14.870
and that's the need--

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.662
that's the reason why
we need to figure out

00:06:16.662 --> 00:06:18.460
how to innovate in them.

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.480
Class 11 was all
about education.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.110
Again, another legacy sector.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.370
And we talked about
a whole set of ways

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.270
to think about science
education, technology

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:34.240
education, and then education
for innovation itself.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:38.410
Could we ever attempt to
think about that as a teaching

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:39.460
approach?

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:42.040
And today will be all about
the future work, which

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.840
I think is an issue that is
going to affect all of you,

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.500
and will kind of dominate
a lot of your time

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.920
over ensuing decades.

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.640
So we're going to try and sort
this one out and try and figure

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:57.130
out what it means by
reading some of the leading

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:59.650
thinkers in this area.

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:05.260
And then Liz was great
by doing the whole--

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.640
innovation is like real estate.

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.450
It's location,
location, location.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:12.317
So it really forms in
these geographic regions.

00:07:12.317 --> 00:07:14.650
You really need to understand
it in geographical region.

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:16.460
We didn't have time for
everything in this class,

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:17.740
but that's certainly one
of the classes I would

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.540
have added if I had the time.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:24.070
So Liz walked us through some
of those initial concepts

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.500
in that field, which she does
really important work in,

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.150
by the way.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:31.600
All right you've got
Brynjolffson Johnson

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.730
and you've got the
first David Autor piece.

00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:36.490
So why don't I do
those together,

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.830
because they're they
critique each other, right?

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.370
And this is a big debate that's
going on, on the MIT campus

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.810
with different perspectives
here as we're going to see,

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.660
about what's going to
happen to work here.

00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:57.400
And so after the
Great Recession,

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.840
the economy went through
a very slow period

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.930
of putting people back to work.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:07.210
Now, we're now back to
5% or lower employment,

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.810
but we still have a large number
of people that never went back

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.400
into the workforce.

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.960
A shockingly high number.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.540
So this problem-- we're
not past this problem.

00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:21.440
So this is an early piece by
Erik Brynjolffson and Andrew

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.940
McAfee.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:22.990
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.160
Brynjolffson.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.630
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Brynjolffson.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:26.330
Forgive me, Tom.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.330
AUDIENCE: Just in case--

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:28.350
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
No, I appreciate it.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:30.070
I'm glad we're going
to get that right.

00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:30.790
AUDIENCE: Brynjolffson.

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:31.900
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Brynjolfsson.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.400
All right.

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.330
Good.

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:35.789
So Eric and Andrew--

00:08:35.789 --> 00:08:41.320
how's that-- brought us a
whole set of new thinking

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.555
about this territory.

00:08:42.555 --> 00:08:44.680
And there's a debate about
what their findings are.

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.470
This is an early
piece they produced.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:51.760
Their book on this topic is
called The Second Machine Age.

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.530
So they looked at
this problem of why

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:55.240
wasn't the economy
putting people back

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.530
to work at a rate that
was more acceptable?

00:08:59.530 --> 00:09:03.760
And they argued that
the 2007, 2008 recession

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:07.450
wasn't a typical
business cycle recession.

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:10.960
In other words, you didn't lose
your job and then get it back.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.190
You lost your job, period.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.320
Right?

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.110
Your job did not come
back after this recession,

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:19.390
in many sectors,
particularly manufacturing

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.760
as we talked about.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:25.060
So one explanation was, gee,
it's just not a normal business

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.340
cycle.

00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.590
It's stagnation.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:32.770
And there's a long-term
decline in certain sectors

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.750
that you have to
understand and look at.

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:40.150
A third explanation, which
they venture to set out,

00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.720
was that it wasn't
really stagnation either,

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.300
and it wasn't too
little innovation--

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.920
a signal of stagnation--

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.210
it was too much
innovation for the economy

00:09:52.210 --> 00:09:54.010
to manage and handle.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:55.900
And so they embarked,
then, on kind

00:09:55.900 --> 00:10:01.700
of a history of this concern
about the end of work,

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:05.050
which they argue started
in 1995 with a growing

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:09.460
concern at that time about
technological job displacement.

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.410
And they look at the
surrounding technologies

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:13.000
that are emerging--

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:18.010
Google's driverless
cars, Watson's Jeopardy,

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:22.420
Ray Kurzwell, in his book,
The Age of Spiritual Machines:

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:25.030
When Computers Exceed
Human Intelligence,

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:27.705
began to portray some
of these concerns.

00:10:27.705 --> 00:10:29.830
In other words, people were
going to get displaced.

00:10:29.830 --> 00:10:31.990
Their work was going
to be displaced

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:36.100
by the advent of the IT
technology revolution

00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:41.560
as it moves into artificial
intelligence areas.

00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:45.070
What is clear is that there
has been exponential growth

00:10:45.070 --> 00:10:47.380
in the computing sector.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.150
And computers are
thousands of times

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:53.380
better than they
were 30 years ago.

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.430
But there are areas that
Eric and Andrew point out,

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.090
where computers are not
good at particularly

00:11:01.090 --> 00:11:06.630
the sort of combination of both
physical and knowledge areas,

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:09.218
and are not yet good at
general problem solving,

00:11:09.218 --> 00:11:11.010
and they're not good
at creative abilities.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.790
But there has been
exponential progress.

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:16.240
So there's still a significant
distance here they note.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:19.570
But their concern is
that is on the way,

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:23.590
and it's going to disrupt
a lot of employment

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:25.720
in the economy over time.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:33.160
And then they argue that given
that exponential advance,

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.130
there are two fundamental
strategies in response.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:41.140
One is an organizational
innovation strategy.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.910
And the core idea
here is there's

00:11:42.910 --> 00:11:44.980
an opportunity for
creative entrepreneurs

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:51.190
that can create new business
models that combine the growing

00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:56.320
numbers of mid-skilled workers
with ever-cheaper technologies

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.270
to create new kinds of value.

00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.110
All right?

00:11:59.110 --> 00:12:02.320
That could be one way
out of this unemployment

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.780
social disruption box.

00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:06.910
And they argue that
digital technologies

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.980
do create great
opportunities for individuals

00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.780
to use their own kind
of unique capabilities.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.430
They ask, are we running
out of innovation?

00:12:16.430 --> 00:12:19.960
And when businesses are based
on bits instead of atoms,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:23.260
then each new product adds
to the set of building blocks

00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.570
that are available to
the next entrepreneur,

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.240
instead of depleting
the stock of ideas.

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:31.480
So this truly is an exponential
growth kind of territory.

00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.910
There's no denying
it, they argue.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:35.992
But it does create a new
set of building blocks

00:12:35.992 --> 00:12:37.450
that are potentially
available here

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.030
that you can think about
organizational innovation

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.800
to get around.

00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.960
The second argument
they make is that we

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.410
need to make significant
investments in human capital

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:52.240
as a way of dealing with
this oncoming set of issues.

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.460
So improving the
education and skill sets

00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.990
to get the most out of our
kind of racing technology, they

00:12:58.990 --> 00:13:01.900
argue, is important.

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.370
And they posit that there's
a third Industrial Revolution

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.440
really around computing
and information,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.600
which is based on
information that,

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.280
in effect, doesn't get used up.

00:13:15.090 --> 00:13:20.380
So that's Eric and
Andrew's picture.

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:23.110
And it's a dark picture, right?

00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:24.962
Their concern is
that a lot of people

00:13:24.962 --> 00:13:26.170
are going to get left behind.

00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:29.860
Let's frantically do
organizational reforms,

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:36.190
let's do other kinds of changes
in the educational system.

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:40.360
They argue for a
set of tax changes.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.490
They really propose in the
end-- not in this piece,

00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:46.000
but in later pieces-- a negative
income tax to kind of redress

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.150
the inequality wealth
balance in the society.

00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:52.960
They're concerned that
this is upon us, right?

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.720
And then David
Autor, MIT economist

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:59.590
who's been doing some remarkable
work in a series of areas,

00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:01.972
we read his work
on manufacturing.

00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.720
He writes a responsive piece.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.130
Why are There
Still so Many Jobs?

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:13.990
is his response.

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:17.920
And he argues that Eric
and Andrew are only

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.010
taking a partial look
at this phenomena.

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:27.440
So let's do a little bit
of historical material.

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.900
Historically,
economics has always

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.480
found that technological
advance, historically,

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:35.110
always creates net new jobs.

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.860
And it's been going on since
the Industrial Revolution.

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:41.900
And every time you study one of
these great ways of innovation,

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:46.160
net, there are people affected,
disrupted by the new innovation

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.480
waves, right?

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.400
Buggy whip manufacturers
had a real problem

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.650
with the advent of the
automobile internal combustion

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:52.818
engine, right?

00:14:52.818 --> 00:14:54.860
So you can think about a
lot of displacement that

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.250
has occurred historically, but
net, the amount of employment

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:01.770
overall was a net gain.

00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:08.040
And David said, is that
era over, is the question.

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.530
And his basic answer is no.

00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:11.970
That's not over.

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:14.790
And what he would
argue, in a way,

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:16.570
is an assessment and
counting problem.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:19.260
It's not that there is not
going to be disruption.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:28.320
It's just that automation
can also complement labor

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:31.470
and can raise outputs
in ways that lead

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.660
to higher demand for labor.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:34.290
Right?

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:38.010
So automation does indeed
substitute for labor,

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:42.210
but in this complimentary
way, automation

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:47.400
can also lead to new
kinds of output, that lead

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:48.690
to new kinds of employment.

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.580
And you've got to
understand and assess that--

00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:53.890
the combination of these
factors, the substitution

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.990
as well as the complementarity--

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:59.590
in understanding what's
going to happen ahead.

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:01.390
And he argues that
commentators tend

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:04.180
to overstate the extent
of machine substitution

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:07.840
for the human labor and ignore
the strong complementarities

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.440
between automation and labor,
that in the end increase

00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:16.190
productivity, raise earnings,
and augment demand for labor.

00:16:16.190 --> 00:16:18.850
So there's one important
thing that has not changed

00:16:18.850 --> 00:16:21.690
in the economy here, right?

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:27.820
So if we look at agriculture
in the 19th century,

00:16:27.820 --> 00:16:32.640
we employed approaching-- over
40% of our population in 1900

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.870
was employed in agriculture.

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.960
Now, we employ less than 1%.

00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.510
Much greater output.

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:42.110
So that's a story of
intense productivity gains.

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.690
But agriculture is different
than the production of goods--

00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.480
non-agricultural goods.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.180
If you look at food
consumption per human being

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:58.640
in the United States,
it's not very different

00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:01.520
now than it was in 1900.

00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:04.543
Even in America there's only so
many calories we can consume.

00:17:04.543 --> 00:17:05.710
I mean, we're working on it.

00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:09.349
But even here there are limits.

00:17:09.349 --> 00:17:13.790
That's not true in the
production of goods.

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:18.550
We seem to have an insatiable
appetite for more goods.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.675
And occasionally a movement
will hit society like,

00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:21.800
let's get rid of our stuff.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.339
But it never last very long.

00:17:25.339 --> 00:17:27.780
So it's a different world.

00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.530
We can't make the
agricultural analogy

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:33.440
to non-agricultural
good production, right?

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:35.060
They're different worlds.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.070
And part of the
story that the David

00:17:37.070 --> 00:17:40.070
otter is attempting
to illustrate here

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:42.080
is that the limit--

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:44.120
there is no limit
on goods, all right?

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.030
So that complementarity,
that combination

00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.980
of people and machines can lead
to new kinds of technologies,

00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.620
new kinds of advances,
new kinds of goods that

00:17:54.620 --> 00:17:56.720
fit evolving sets of needs.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:04.100
And he provides an interesting
example of complementarity.

00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:10.282
He notes that ATMs, the
cash machines in every bank

00:18:10.282 --> 00:18:11.990
that you know of, and
all over the place,

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:15.350
they were introduced in 1970.

00:18:15.350 --> 00:18:18.980
The assumption at the time
was that, well, there's

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:20.840
not going to be any
more bank tellers.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:23.150
That job is over, right?

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.610
And there were a lot of those.

00:18:25.610 --> 00:18:32.510
But what ended up happening,
was that by 2010, there

00:18:32.510 --> 00:18:37.550
were actually somewhat more
bank tellers, but their job

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:41.450
and been repurposed to not
just doing, counting up cash

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:42.800
and handing it to customers.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.860
Their jobs got repurposed
into, frankly considerably more

00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:50.000
sophisticated, customer
service kind of job.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.980
So an upgrading of the skills
required in a way for that job,

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:57.170
but no loss in employment.

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:59.690
In fact, a very modest gain.

00:18:59.690 --> 00:19:01.640
Despite the fact that
everybody thought

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.890
that sector was going to go.

00:19:03.890 --> 00:19:06.420
So he argues that
that's not unique.

00:19:06.420 --> 00:19:09.900
This is going to occur
in other sectors as well.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.990
So the gains in
productivity have not

00:19:11.990 --> 00:19:14.670
led to a shortfall of demand
for goods and services.

00:19:14.670 --> 00:19:17.090
These keep growing,
which is a big offsetting

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:23.710
factor to the substitution
of automation for work.

00:19:23.710 --> 00:19:25.670
And he provides an
interesting description

00:19:25.670 --> 00:19:28.550
of how you could look at
the different economies

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:32.870
in recent decades,
right, the 1940 to 1970

00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:35.240
economy versus the
current economy.

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.800
His characterization
of the economy

00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:40.460
that has been taking hold since
1980 through the current time,

00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:44.270
is that it's increasingly
professional and technical

00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:46.490
with managerial occupations,
and that they're

00:19:46.490 --> 00:19:48.380
growing pretty rapidly.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.830
Whereas skilled blue collar
occupations are shrinking,

00:19:51.830 --> 00:19:54.080
and that clerical and
sales occupations, which

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.390
are the kind of vulnerable
equivalent of production

00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:59.490
jobs in the information
age, those are in decline.

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:02.600
There's a powerful piece
in The Economist this week

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.510
about the decline in
retail sales operations

00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:07.280
overall in the United
States, in light

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.060
of the explosion of Amazon
and online delivery ordering

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.620
system.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.578
And how are those changes
going to take place?

00:20:14.578 --> 00:20:15.620
What does that look like?

00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.160
And what stores-- location-based
stores are thriving

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.480
and which ones aren't, right?

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.570
It's a very
interesting assessment.

00:20:22.570 --> 00:20:23.070
Steph?

00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:28.960
AUDIENCE: I'm try to figure
out if this is a good time

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:29.870
to ask it.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:35.437
I'm curious about like,
drone technology is still

00:20:35.437 --> 00:20:38.020
not at the point in which it can
take over the entire delivery

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:40.030
system for a
company like Amazon,

00:20:40.030 --> 00:20:42.040
but it seems like the
Federal Government is

00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.290
defunding the Postal Service.

00:20:44.290 --> 00:20:49.120
So what then happens to the
increase in labor, or I guess,

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.000
the increase in demand
of these products

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.298
if there isn't an equal rise
in delivery infrastructure?

00:20:56.298 --> 00:20:57.840
I guess that would
be a consideration

00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.923
that I would hope that The
Economist article would

00:20:59.923 --> 00:21:00.590
address.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:02.020
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah, it
doesn't deal with the Postal

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:02.650
Service question.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:04.300
We can kind of think
it through, right?

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:07.313
So what happened, right?

00:21:07.313 --> 00:21:08.980
I don't know about
the number of letters

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:11.560
you're writing longhand
per day these days,

00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.990
but mine is not high.

00:21:13.990 --> 00:21:16.390
So we've shift over
to online systems.

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:21.100
So the bulk of what
used to be mail is gone.

00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.390
The Postal Service however,
missed the revolution, right?

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:29.350
They missed the fact that
online delivery of goods

00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:32.000
was going to explode.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.370
FedEx had a better model, and
they captured that marketplace.

00:21:37.370 --> 00:21:40.330
So FedEx is thriving
hand-in-glove

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:45.190
with Amazon and other similar
comparable delivery systems.

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:48.150
The Postal Service missed
that revolution by-and-large--

00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:51.190
although they've been
trying to catch up--

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:53.470
to their own detriment
over time, right?

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:54.640
That's kind of the story.

00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:57.160
And when you look in
terms of net employment,

00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.390
we'll see how this sorts out.

00:21:58.390 --> 00:22:02.020
But again, this is an
example of complementarity,

00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.810
the whole Federal
Express and similar--

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.540
DHL, and other express
delivery services--

00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:09.460
that's a complimentary
service that

00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.610
happened to compliment
very nicely the evolution

00:22:12.610 --> 00:22:16.360
of the distribution
of goods originating

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:18.010
through online services.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:19.860
So that helps us think
about some of this.

00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:20.440
Martin?

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.523
AUDIENCE: I mean, [INAUDIBLE]
is like maybe that's

00:22:22.523 --> 00:22:24.610
an industry that is OK
to maybe be disrupted,

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:27.250
because probably when it
began it wasn't profitable.

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:29.188
And so you needed the
government to have it,

00:22:29.188 --> 00:22:30.730
to have it as an
infrastructure for--

00:22:30.730 --> 00:22:31.960
it was a tool for communication.

00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.043
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:22:33.043 --> 00:22:35.805
AUDIENCE: And there is a there's
a huge societal gain from this,

00:22:35.805 --> 00:22:37.180
even though it
wasn't profitable.

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.630
And then with less letters, and
because you have the internet,

00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:43.030
and probably what happened
is all these other companies

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.620
optimized their
logistics really well,

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:45.730
because they're getting
better and better

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:48.070
and they have more money, those
companies became profitable,

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.600
and it was probably way
easier and way cheaper

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.070
to send it through their way.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:53.695
And now you have all
this kind of stagnation

00:22:53.695 --> 00:22:56.690
in innovation inside that--

00:22:56.690 --> 00:22:58.600
you have the Postal
Service, that sector.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.370
So it just wasn't
viable for them

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:01.960
to keep going because it's
just it's just a huge waste.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.710
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right they?

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:04.127
Have a whole set
of disadvantages.

00:23:04.127 --> 00:23:06.190
The government
handed them the task

00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:08.770
of having to deliver
mail and parcels

00:23:08.770 --> 00:23:11.950
to every single neighborhood
in the United States,

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.620
no matter how empty your
neighborhood was, right?

00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.810
If you were out there
in rural South Dakota,

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:18.970
you can imagine that
the economic base

00:23:18.970 --> 00:23:21.400
for a strong delivery system
is probably not there.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.350
So there were a lot
of disadvantages

00:23:23.350 --> 00:23:25.390
they faced going into
this, but in the end,

00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.320
they missed that package
delivery mechanism.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.360
But you make a
good point, Martin.

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.160
Let me wrap up with David Autor.

00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.630
There is, in the end
then, an interplay

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.300
between people and machines.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.370
And the comparative
advantage will

00:23:42.370 --> 00:23:45.310
allow computers to substitute
for workers in performing

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:49.300
routine codifiable tasks.

00:23:49.300 --> 00:23:52.270
But it also amplifies
the comparative advantage

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:55.450
of workers in supplying
problem solving skills,

00:23:55.450 --> 00:23:56.960
adaptability, and creativity.

00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.187
So the people-like capabilities.

00:23:59.187 --> 00:24:01.270
And maybe computers will
get to these some decade,

00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:05.060
but that's not happening
anytime real soon.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.190
So re-addressing the
balance between those two

00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:14.140
is the key to managing the
entry of these new IT-based

00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.590
technologies into the economy,
David Autor would argue.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.630
The frontier of
automation, he recognizes,

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.540
is rapidly advancing.

00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.340
So the challenge of substituting
machines remains intense.

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.360
But if you focus
only on what's lost,

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.300
you miss a really central
economic mechanism.

00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:37.300
So automation affects
the demand for labor

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.210
by raising the
value of the tasks

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:44.650
that workers uniquely
supply, right?

00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:52.650
So that's-- Eric and Andrew tell
us about the challenge ahead

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:58.110
from the IT revolution in
substituting IT for work.

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.030
David Autor begins to
put us on a pathway

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:03.070
to make an assessment of just
what that's going to mean,

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:05.070
and what the balance
between people and machines

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:08.280
is going to be, and how we need
to think about that balance,

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.000
right?

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.150
So that's the core issue
in his article, how come

00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:13.620
there's still so many jobs?

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:18.900
His argument in the end
is, in this territory,

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:23.770
there's going to be
substantial numbers of jobs.

00:25:23.770 --> 00:25:26.010
Beth, it's all yours.

00:25:26.010 --> 00:25:27.760
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:30.260
So there are a lot of really
good questions this week.

00:25:30.260 --> 00:25:34.270
So I want to spend most of
the time discussing those.

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:37.650
Just a few points that I noted.

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:39.620
So maybe perhaps a
little differently,

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:42.850
I found Eric and Andrew's
piece more optimistic

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:43.750
than I expected.

00:25:43.750 --> 00:25:46.060
Especially how it
ends, kind of saying

00:25:46.060 --> 00:25:48.430
like we've been through
these revolutions before,

00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:49.572
we'll get through this one.

00:25:49.572 --> 00:25:51.280
Which I found kind of
weird, because they

00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.160
spent most of the beginning of
the article talking about how

00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:59.320
this was fundamentally different
given its exponential growth.

00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:01.390
So that was a little
hard for me to reconcile.

00:26:01.390 --> 00:26:03.360
I think they're trying to
end it a little more upbeat,

00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.902
but maybe if I read
their whole book,

00:26:04.902 --> 00:26:08.450
I'll see that it's a little
bit more nuanced than that.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:13.660
And then, yeah, as Bill
said, Professor Autor kind of

00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:15.513
portrays a different
story in that,

00:26:15.513 --> 00:26:17.680
like, yes, we need to be
aware of these changes that

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.550
are coming, but they aren't
as bleak as we might think.

00:26:21.550 --> 00:26:22.930
And then he also does talk--

00:26:22.930 --> 00:26:25.000
I think it's in this article--

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.280
about how additional
technological advances,

00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.360
such as machine
learning could cut

00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.450
in a little bit to his
conclusions about the skills

00:26:34.450 --> 00:26:39.170
that humans have that
are unique from machines.

00:26:39.170 --> 00:26:43.480
But starting first with
this Eric Andrew piece,

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:45.370
Matt brought up a really
interesting question

00:26:45.370 --> 00:26:48.250
that I think is
worth discussing.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:50.260
So one of the things
that they talk about

00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:55.420
is this new ecosystem will
have a lot of opportunities

00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:56.530
for entrepreneurs.

00:26:56.530 --> 00:27:00.280
But Matt noted that, especially
like in Silicon Valley,

00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.380
we see that a lot
of IT entrepreneurs

00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:07.420
are kind of creating apps
or other new advances that

00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:10.180
don't have a lot of value for
economic growth, that might

00:27:10.180 --> 00:27:14.850
just be like making like,
solving first world problems

00:27:14.850 --> 00:27:16.750
as they like to say.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:20.560
So what do you think the reality
is with these entrepreneurs

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.150
actually creating
new companies that

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:26.180
are going to be able
to foster job growth?

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.270
AUDIENCE: Oh, yeah I'll
put a quick point on that.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.530
I would say that right
now what's happened

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:31.060
is that because
the IT revolution

00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:33.160
there were these sectors that--

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:35.448
it's pretty much the scaling
and cycle distribution.

00:27:35.448 --> 00:27:37.240
So things that don't
matter, you can scale,

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.770
but you make a lot
of money off them.

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:40.090
But we're entering a
period where people are

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.530
going to do things that matter.

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:43.480
And now you have
the capital markets,

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.270
you have the
infrastructure of how

00:27:45.270 --> 00:27:47.830
you grow companies
quickly, how you on board.

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:51.040
So this whole infrastructure has
already been built out, right?

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:53.350
So the way I would compare
is like when Amazon started,

00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:55.308
they built this
infrastructure, and it was just

00:27:55.308 --> 00:27:56.963
to distribute books, right?

00:27:56.963 --> 00:27:59.380
And then later, they evolved
to all these other platforms.

00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:01.797
So the benefit now is that you
have these capital markets.

00:28:01.797 --> 00:28:05.800
So that, say, somebody does
do like a very important

00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.140
innovation to
the-- like CRISPR--

00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:11.530
you can get it passed on faster.

00:28:11.530 --> 00:28:15.760
So right now, I would say, like,
you should think of Snapchat,

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:18.340
Facebook is kind of like
little to middle leagues.

00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:20.640
But it creates the
environment that if someone

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.590
does do something significant
with a real innovation

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:26.520
and creates an industry,
you will get maybe

00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.810
a trillion dollar company.

00:28:28.810 --> 00:28:31.143
And you'll have somebody who
becomes very, very wealthy.

00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:33.352
AUDIENCE: Would you-- I'm
interested in your opinion.

00:28:33.352 --> 00:28:35.530
Would you argue that
those first world problem

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:39.250
solvers are necessary steps to
allow the big players to exist?

00:28:39.250 --> 00:28:43.673
Like if the market was
dominated first by the CRISPR--

00:28:43.673 --> 00:28:45.340
AUDIENCE: I wouldn't
say it's necessary,

00:28:45.340 --> 00:28:46.965
but I'd say that's
how it is right now.

00:28:46.965 --> 00:28:49.240
And it's just been built on.

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.330
There's also a common strategy
where it seems really stupid

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.820
until it's not.

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:56.540
So it can also go
back and forth.

00:28:56.540 --> 00:28:57.790
If you look at Silicon Valley.

00:28:57.790 --> 00:29:00.520
Silicon Valley took 57 years
to become what it is today.

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.370
It really started off with
Stanford using their funding

00:29:03.370 --> 00:29:05.847
from World War II, and
making a decision--

00:29:05.847 --> 00:29:07.180
which was different than MIT's--

00:29:07.180 --> 00:29:09.808
that I don't want to keep
the money inside the lab.

00:29:09.808 --> 00:29:11.350
You built something,
you research it,

00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:13.532
and then you go out and
make a company off of it.

00:29:13.532 --> 00:29:14.990
But it takes a long
period of time.

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:16.120
And that was hard tech.

00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.170
But it was just hard to scale.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:19.295
Because what used to happen
is-- like in the '90s--

00:29:19.295 --> 00:29:22.280
so if you wanted to make
computer science company, so

00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.280
like something like
Facebook, there was actually

00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:26.162
15 Facebooks before Facebook.

00:29:26.162 --> 00:29:28.120
And what happened is
you'd have to buy servers,

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.328
you'd have to configure them.

00:29:29.328 --> 00:29:33.610
And you'd probably spend about
like $100,000 to $750,000

00:29:33.610 --> 00:29:34.960
to buy all your servers, right?

00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:36.600
And then you got to
start it with the idea.

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:38.580
So like if somebody had to do
a Snapchat and be like, OK,

00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.622
I paid a million dollars,
now I have to build it.

00:29:40.622 --> 00:29:42.197
It's such a huge problem.

00:29:42.197 --> 00:29:44.530
And so the issue, the reason
that hard tech didn't scale

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:47.020
before, is because you
would ask for that money,

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:48.485
and you would give up about 30%.

00:29:48.485 --> 00:29:50.860
What would happen is the
founder would start the company,

00:29:50.860 --> 00:29:52.060
and then what would
happen is because you

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:53.200
don't have any
management experience,

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.110
they'd kick you out.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:56.570
So there wasn't much
control in the founder.

00:29:56.570 --> 00:29:58.570
So now what's happened
is because of the funding

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.057
environment,
everybody has capital,

00:30:00.057 --> 00:30:01.390
but there's very few good ideas.

00:30:01.390 --> 00:30:04.955
And in fact, the
moniker of VCs is

00:30:04.955 --> 00:30:07.330
that there's only really like
five really great companies

00:30:07.330 --> 00:30:09.430
that we should
invest in this year.

00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:10.870
So there's a lot of money.

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:14.270
And I would say that it's more
like, it's more like E News,

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:14.770
right?

00:30:14.770 --> 00:30:17.187
All these companies you hear
of is just like scandal, just

00:30:17.187 --> 00:30:18.843
like gossip tabloids.

00:30:18.843 --> 00:30:20.260
There's a couple
of good companies

00:30:20.260 --> 00:30:22.360
that every year will come out
and create really substantial

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.800
technologies, and
those are the people

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.660
that you won't hear about
today, you won't hear about them

00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:26.600
a year from now.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:29.705
But they'll be around 20 years
from now, 10 years from now.

00:30:29.705 --> 00:30:30.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:30:30.330 --> 00:30:32.590
AUDIENCE: Do you think
that capital system--

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.930
I mean, I imagine it would
need to change a bit once.

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.610
You start having
like IT companies

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.400
that are matching like
lot mid-scope workers

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.490
with the technology.

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:45.300
So say you have a VC person
that's interested in startups

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:47.740
right now in the
software industry.

00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.320
They have like almost
100% profit margin,

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:53.730
now you start hiring people and
your profit margins are lower.

00:30:53.730 --> 00:30:58.750
Do you think this
system that's being

00:30:58.750 --> 00:31:01.535
put in place by what we have now
will be able to adapt for that?

00:31:01.535 --> 00:31:03.910
AUDIENCE: Can you specify that
question a little bit more

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:04.850
and give an example?

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:06.960
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So I think
you make an interesting point,

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.752
Matt, and this takes
us back to the reading

00:31:08.752 --> 00:31:11.570
that we did about the
engine and cyclotron road.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:14.590
And the fact that the venture
capital system in the US

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:18.130
is really focused on software
companies at this point.

00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:23.310
And what Martin is
telling us is early stage,

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.030
the foundations
are built, they'll

00:31:25.030 --> 00:31:27.880
able to move to
hard technologies.

00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.150
We're not seeing
that yet, frankly.

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:34.090
Again, biotech is
a separate world,

00:31:34.090 --> 00:31:36.250
and they've built a
system there by which

00:31:36.250 --> 00:31:39.700
they can manage the scale up
with their current financial

00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.630
model.

00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:42.340
But I think there's--

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:45.280
you've given us a
hopeful perspective

00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.180
of what could evolve.

00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:47.390
AUDIENCE: I would say that
an example of now going

00:31:47.390 --> 00:31:49.015
to the physical world
from the IT world

00:31:49.015 --> 00:31:50.590
will be like in Uber
and Airbnb where

00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.697
it's starting to filter
out, and then hard tech

00:31:53.697 --> 00:31:55.030
will be a whole different field.

00:31:55.030 --> 00:31:56.405
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
But the model

00:31:56.405 --> 00:31:58.690
is still job
displacement, right?

00:31:58.690 --> 00:32:01.410
And that's how you
get your return.

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.690
So it's a really
difficult model.

00:32:04.690 --> 00:32:06.900
And we don't necessarily
have to go that way,

00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:10.350
as we talked about
in the energy class.

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.180
A country like
Germany is organized

00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:15.300
around manufacturing-led
innovation.

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.480
They're producing-- there's no
shortage of demand for goods

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.230
worldwide.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:21.750
If anything, it's growing as
a lot of the developing world

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:24.805
becomes emerging economies.

00:32:24.805 --> 00:32:27.180
And Germany is well positioned
to take advantage of that.

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:29.263
And they've just organized
their innovation system

00:32:29.263 --> 00:32:30.300
very differently.

00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:32.370
But Martin, you
make a good point.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.120
This may be staging
that we could

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:36.540
move hard technologies into.

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.720
Much as I mean, biotech
is a separate world.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:42.240
But CRISPR, in a
way, will result

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:44.220
in what we could
call hard, maybe

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.630
they're soft technologies
that could be in effect

00:32:48.630 --> 00:32:52.890
a platform off an IT base.

00:32:52.890 --> 00:32:54.380
How about another
question, Beth?

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.150
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:32:55.150 --> 00:32:56.950
So I think just
yesterday there was

00:32:56.950 --> 00:32:59.980
an article in The Washington
Post or New York Times--

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.670
I forget-- talking about
how one of the downsides

00:33:03.670 --> 00:33:06.400
to a lot of the lower paying
jobs that college graduates are

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.250
getting, such as
counseling or teaching,

00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:11.560
is that they are harder
to displace by automation.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.980
So they're talking about how
so many investment banking

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:17.020
jobs have already been
replaced by automation,

00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.210
so you shouldn't feel
so bad that you're

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.950
taking a lower paying job
because it's a safer job.

00:33:21.950 --> 00:33:23.950
And so this reminded me--

00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:25.950
this question from Chris,
I think, gets to that.

00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:29.440
So how do we accelerate
growth in these job areas

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.810
when we're admitting that
they're seemingly less

00:33:31.810 --> 00:33:36.100
desirable right now for a lot
of people because they pay less?

00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:39.280
And if these are the jobs
that maybe more people should

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:42.500
be going into, how do we
convince people to do that?

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:47.170
AUDIENCE: Well, [INAUDIBLE]
there is an article [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:49.990
Washington Post about
how San Francisco is

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:52.390
creating teacher housing.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:55.485
Because they felt like they
were getting a lot of stories

00:33:55.485 --> 00:33:56.860
about how teachers
had to commute

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:59.620
in for several hours a day
into the greater Bay Area,

00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:02.350
and then how some people
were living in people's

00:34:02.350 --> 00:34:04.840
kitchens because they
couldn't afford the rent.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:07.660
And so what San Francisco,
the municipal government, you

00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.940
know again, the role of
municipalities, decided

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:12.940
was that they needed to
build housing specifically

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:13.637
for teachers.

00:34:13.637 --> 00:34:15.429
This wasn't going to
be affordable housing,

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:17.179
this isn't going to
be low-income housing.

00:34:17.179 --> 00:34:19.810
This is going to be housing
for teachers to live in so they

00:34:19.810 --> 00:34:21.400
can teach at the schools.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.080
And I feel like
perhaps there is going

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:25.600
to have to be sort of
additional incentives in terms

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:29.600
of infrastructure and
housing to support this,

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.969
I guess to support that
population of workers,

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:37.719
because it doesn't seem
like it's politically

00:34:37.719 --> 00:34:40.449
viable to increase
salary, but it

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:42.580
does seem like a
reasonable proposition

00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.909
to say, so long as you're
working for our schools,

00:34:44.909 --> 00:34:47.230
and so long as you are
providing a public service that

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:49.600
is going to provide a
net benefit to society,

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:53.290
then you should have access to
housing and food, at a minimum.

00:34:55.090 --> 00:34:57.090
AUDIENCE: Seems like--
remember that one article

00:34:57.090 --> 00:34:59.040
you showed me about
unicorns, and how they're

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:03.300
very masculine and immature?

00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.975
AUDIENCE: That is
not what it said.

00:35:04.975 --> 00:35:06.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:06.870
AUDIENCE: Well, if you're
going to talk about--

00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:08.240
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
That's an unrelated topic.

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:08.760
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.110
Because it has exit rounds and--

00:35:10.110 --> 00:35:10.770
AUDIENCE: Yeah, OK.

00:35:10.770 --> 00:35:11.380
AUDIENCE: --seed rounds.

00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.410
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I guess
I can also talk about.

00:35:13.410 --> 00:35:15.870
Yeah, so I would be I would be
happy to send it to all of you

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:16.200
as well.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.617
It was an article
that was written

00:35:17.617 --> 00:35:20.430
by a woman on-- or two women
on Medium who had done research

00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:23.160
on the unicorn economy, that
is the creation of a billion

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:24.810
dollar company.

00:35:24.810 --> 00:35:26.790
And thinking about
how that's not

00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.073
sustainable in the long run.

00:35:28.073 --> 00:35:30.240
What we actually need to
be focusing venture capital

00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:33.390
funds are our zebra
companies, which

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.378
are companies that
care not only about--

00:35:35.378 --> 00:35:37.920
they're sort of like the triple
bottom line companies, right?

00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.000
There is going to be a benefit
to the company economically,

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.285
there's going to be a benefit
to society economically,

00:35:44.285 --> 00:35:45.660
and there's going
to be a benefit

00:35:45.660 --> 00:35:48.720
to society as a result of the
product that they're creating.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.960
And so they introduced
the zebra model,

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.650
because zebras are sort
of mutualistic animals

00:35:54.650 --> 00:35:56.580
that travel in a
pack, as opposed

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.510
to these unicorns
that don't exist.

00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:59.010
Right?

00:35:59.010 --> 00:36:03.000
They're not real animals
that sort of promote

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.790
any sort of benefit
to the public.

00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:06.720
And so I'd be happy
to pass it along.

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.220
AUDIENCE: I mean the article
makes a really good point

00:36:08.220 --> 00:36:10.470
about how like these other
companies that are unicorns

00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:12.930
are kind of like a
bull in a China shop.

00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.592
They go and they ruin like a
lot of societal structures,

00:36:15.592 --> 00:36:17.550
and they displace people,
and they don't really

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:20.215
consider it, or take
any consideration.

00:36:20.215 --> 00:36:22.590
And how it kind of-- yeah, it
was an interesting article.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:23.940
AUDIENCE: And the one
point that it doesn't hit,

00:36:23.940 --> 00:36:25.620
I will underscore
for all of you,

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.000
is the way in which
companies like Uber,

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.250
and I think some of us know
this, but are essentially

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.360
informalizing our
economy, right?

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:36.720
Like, one of the things that
we treasure about economy

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:38.095
in the developed
world is that it

00:36:38.095 --> 00:36:41.227
is a formal economy
in which people

00:36:41.227 --> 00:36:42.810
have labor protections,
in which there

00:36:42.810 --> 00:36:44.227
are trade unions,
in which workers

00:36:44.227 --> 00:36:46.680
have rights and protections
against their employers,

00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:47.550
and have that--

00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:49.440
they can use their
citizenship as a means

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.570
of leveraging against
discrimination

00:36:51.570 --> 00:36:54.600
that might occur to them in
the labor economy, right?

00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:57.450
We, as wage laborers,
should get protections.

00:36:57.450 --> 00:36:59.850
But the way that these
companies are introducing models

00:36:59.850 --> 00:37:02.790
and perhaps, in Alibaba's
case, the kind that they're

00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.190
bringing to the
US, is that they're

00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:06.810
removing the labor protections.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:10.110
So what happens if you
expose citizens to--

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.020
or if you revert citizens
from wage laborers

00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:17.220
with protections to informal
laborers who sort of are

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.770
itinerant in the economy.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:21.210
I mean, that's an
incredible consideration.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:21.980
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Look, we went through

00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:23.070
in the 19th century.

00:37:23.070 --> 00:37:25.260
I mean, with the advent
of industrialization there

00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:27.210
were no worker protections.

00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:31.050
And massive problems
with the workforce.

00:37:31.050 --> 00:37:32.280
We've all read Dickens.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:36.450
So we went through
that phase, and will

00:37:36.450 --> 00:37:38.520
more formalized
protection systems

00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:42.910
evolve over time, even
for the unicorn world?

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:44.150
Let's move to David Autor

00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.270
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:47.800
All right, so as we
kind of mentioned,

00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:50.820
Autor seems to be
slightly less concerned

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:55.290
with the immediate
impacts of automation.

00:37:55.290 --> 00:38:00.270
But Lily pointed out that there
is some really startling job

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:01.980
loss in some sectors.

00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.320
So even if some of
these jobs are replaced,

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:09.120
if we see an entire sector, such
as the retail sector, collapse,

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.490
is that something that the
economy can bounce back from?

00:38:11.490 --> 00:38:13.728
What does that mean
for social order?

00:38:13.728 --> 00:38:16.020
I mean, we've already seen
the effects of manufacturing

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:20.430
downturns have had pretty
dramatic effects on social ways

00:38:20.430 --> 00:38:21.930
that we are
constructing ourselves.

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:24.840
So even if we can replace
some of these jobs,

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.530
what do you think that means
for the rest of society?

00:38:30.792 --> 00:38:32.250
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Here's a trick.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.180
Ask Lilly since she
wrote the question.

00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:36.430
AUDIENCE: Well, I was just
thinking about it because--

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.030
I don't know-- my
husband was listing to me

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:41.520
more than a dozen
retail companies

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:44.690
that are entering bankruptcy.

00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:48.990
I think JCPenney,
Sears, et cetera.

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:53.910
Retail stores that are huge
and employ a lot of people.

00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:55.770
And we thought of
as like staples

00:38:55.770 --> 00:39:01.410
in our economy and
our consumer needs.

00:39:01.410 --> 00:39:06.030
Also, there is talk of the
mall industry going under.

00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:10.230
Just this like-- because
people don't go to the mall

00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.293
like they used to all the time.

00:39:12.293 --> 00:39:13.710
So I'm just wondering
if those are

00:39:13.710 --> 00:39:17.580
going to have almost a
domino effect of well,

00:39:17.580 --> 00:39:20.972
a couple of retailers
not that impactful,

00:39:20.972 --> 00:39:21.930
not that big of a deal.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.513
But then if you start to think
about the infrastructure that's

00:39:24.513 --> 00:39:27.990
built up around malls, even
the parking lots for malls,

00:39:27.990 --> 00:39:30.655
like what's going
to happen to those?

00:39:30.655 --> 00:39:32.280
What are we going to
replace them with?

00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:35.056
I just think it might
get a little desolate?

00:39:35.056 --> 00:39:40.455
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I would
look into vacancies in malls.

00:39:40.455 --> 00:39:42.330
The way I would do it
was like, if everything

00:39:42.330 --> 00:39:44.330
was statistical analysis
of the malls in the US,

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:46.170
and if they have vacancies.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:48.705
Because what I'm pretty
much thinking is probably

00:39:48.705 --> 00:39:52.103
would happen is like the
JCPenney model was optimized

00:39:52.103 --> 00:39:53.520
for the '90s, and
it didn't evolve

00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:56.270
into what the new consumer
needs would turn more niche.

00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:58.640
And so they just lost their
edge and are losing money.

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.930
But there's probably
new stores like Lush

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:05.913
or like Kroger coming in
and taking over those.

00:40:05.913 --> 00:40:07.830
That's probably what I
think that the business

00:40:07.830 --> 00:40:09.240
models of the past
have been disrupted,

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.320
and now there's new
people coming in.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.737
Because people
still go to malls--

00:40:11.737 --> 00:40:14.740
AUDIENCE: But what if Lush,
say like, you know how people--

00:40:14.740 --> 00:40:16.380
I actually don't
shop at Lush, but I

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:18.420
know that they make
the products in stores.

00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.700
I mean, what if machines
come into Lush, and then

00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:23.510
the products, I mean the
laborers become irrelevant?

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:24.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:25.707
My little sister loves Lush.

00:40:26.723 --> 00:40:28.140
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I think you're

00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:30.057
making an important point
there, Martin, which

00:40:30.057 --> 00:40:36.120
is that there may well be ways
to adapt a face-to-face store

00:40:36.120 --> 00:40:38.290
model to these new realities.

00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:41.413
And there's a slew of companies
that are actually working hard

00:40:41.413 --> 00:40:42.330
on doing exactly this.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:43.050
AUDIENCE: I mean--

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:44.550
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
And then there's

00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:47.490
a whole set of companies
that specialize

00:40:47.490 --> 00:40:50.980
in kind of last year's goods.

00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:54.990
Think TJ Maxx, right,
that are thriving, right?

00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:56.720
And suppose you built
your mall around--

00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:57.120
AUDIENCE: H & M.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:57.870
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
--a combination

00:40:57.870 --> 00:40:58.710
of those two models.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:01.510
Maybe that's a more
interesting mall model.

00:41:01.510 --> 00:41:03.420
So again, I'm not sure.

00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:05.670
I think we've got to
keep in mind just how

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:10.050
fast these changes are upon us,
and what the strategies are.

00:41:10.050 --> 00:41:13.950
I think David Autor would argue
that there's a new delivery

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:16.740
model emerging here, right?

00:41:16.740 --> 00:41:20.310
A new kind of role for
people that's just like we

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:23.730
saw with the ATM machines,
that's actually a significantly

00:41:23.730 --> 00:41:25.320
upgraded kind of occupation.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.350
And can we move on
those kinds of steps,

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:32.670
right, and then readjust some
of the existing models for that?

00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:34.010
I mean, it's an open question.

00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:35.910
In this piece in The
Economist this week,

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:38.190
which I recommended
earlier, reiterates

00:41:38.190 --> 00:41:39.690
some of the things
you were raising,

00:41:39.690 --> 00:41:42.470
Lily, which is
that there's going

00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:44.640
to be a lot of grief
in malls unless they

00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:47.783
get their models sorted out.

00:41:47.783 --> 00:41:49.200
And they note a
number of examples

00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.755
of models of malls that are
actually working to do that.

00:41:51.755 --> 00:41:53.880
AUDIENCE: I think there's
two main things happening

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.135
that are probably going to
be disruptive to retailers.

00:41:57.135 --> 00:41:59.760
Because I've studied retail for
a bit looking at a whole market

00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.570
analysis.

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.720
And there's a reason
Amazon's going to retail,

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:05.580
is because all of e-commerce
is only 30% of what people buy.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.922
People still buy like,
and go to places.

00:42:07.922 --> 00:42:08.880
It's just a lot better.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.360
They get to see it,
they get to feel it.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.840
And that's why they go to malls.

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.340
Their disruption though,
is that they're not

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.440
going to really have workers.

00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:16.110
I don't know if you've
seen how they're

00:42:16.110 --> 00:42:17.152
going to do their stores.

00:42:17.152 --> 00:42:18.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.410
AUDIENCE: The other--
that's one disruption where

00:42:19.410 --> 00:42:21.180
if you don't have employees.

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:22.710
But issues like
teenagers, right?

00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:23.432
Like, it's not--

00:42:23.432 --> 00:42:25.140
I don't know if somebody
expects to raise

00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:28.440
a family on like an H & M
salary, or like a Zara salary.

00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:32.078
The second disruption would
be 3D printers, and what

00:42:32.078 --> 00:42:34.620
it does when you do materials,
and when you do like, fashion,

00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:35.420
even.

00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.780
Because if you go into a store--

00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:39.470
because most of their
cost is all inventory.

00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:41.095
And it leads to a
lot of logistics.

00:42:41.095 --> 00:42:43.470
If I can make my store in such
a way that you can come in

00:42:43.470 --> 00:42:45.992
and you'll get a tailored
dress is probably better

00:42:45.992 --> 00:42:48.450
because it's very unique and
you can make like a 3D printer

00:42:48.450 --> 00:42:50.460
for a dress, that'd
be really cool.

00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.560
And somebody can go in
and get a perfect dress

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.227
based on their style,
based on a picture

00:42:54.227 --> 00:42:56.007
that they have on
their like, Instagram.

00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:58.090
Then you don't have inventory
and they can sell it

00:42:58.090 --> 00:42:59.965
at like a decent price,
and it would probably

00:42:59.965 --> 00:43:01.980
be a relatively
cheap dress, right?

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.780
Or if you can go and
get a tailor-made suit

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.900
if you're a guy, and it's
like perfect for you,

00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.310
and it costs you like, $100,
$200, and it's in the fabric

00:43:08.310 --> 00:43:08.700
that you want.

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.270
Especially with
synthetic fabrics.

00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:12.478
I don't know if we talked
about in this class-- well,

00:43:12.478 --> 00:43:14.970
we talked about in
the industrial center.

00:43:14.970 --> 00:43:16.440
But those are the
big disruptions.

00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.050
Or if you're like,
instead of having--

00:43:18.050 --> 00:43:20.280
being an auto store, instead
of having all the inventory

00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:22.620
that cost a lot of money, and
it gets old, and it gets rusty,

00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.745
you can build a part when
somebody comes in exactly

00:43:24.745 --> 00:43:27.270
for their car because you
have the data for that piece.

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.120
That's the big disruption.

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:31.240
And it will-- and
it's like-- it'll

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.460
be quick toppling of a
lot of core businesses

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:34.390
that-- because
all you have to do

00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:36.723
is look at their balance
sheet, see where they spent all

00:43:36.723 --> 00:43:39.070
their money, and then you
make that your business model

00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:40.760
as a startup completely
the opposite.

00:43:40.760 --> 00:43:42.670
And then they cant'
compete against you.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:44.587
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And
against this backdrop,

00:43:44.587 --> 00:43:50.890
remember, too, that the entire
movement of computer-like goods

00:43:50.890 --> 00:43:56.560
was towards these big box stores
in distant low-cost suburbs

00:43:56.560 --> 00:43:57.910
with gigantic parking lots.

00:43:57.910 --> 00:44:00.540
That was the entire
movement of that sector.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.760
Until Apple completely
reinvented the model,

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:08.320
and decided that, let's have
fabulous face-to-face, highly

00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:14.170
personal, employee-heavy,
great service,

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:17.250
beautiful designed stores.

00:44:17.250 --> 00:44:19.180
It is the most valuable
retail property

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.440
in the planet is an Apple Store.

00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.703
There's nothing like it, right?

00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:25.870
They've managed to create
more value per square foot

00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:30.160
than any real estate magnate
ever dreamed of, right?

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:33.190
Again, through a very
different kind of model,

00:44:33.190 --> 00:44:36.280
and again, taking advantage
of a new kind of way

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.590
of looking at employees,
and in effect,

00:44:38.590 --> 00:44:41.960
upskilling that
whole employee base.

00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.560
So these are ways in
which David Autor would

00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:50.020
argue are ways of creating
complementarity to these new,

00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:52.430
evolving technologies.

00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:54.310
How about one more
Auto question then?

00:44:54.310 --> 00:44:55.060
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:58.330
So the other kind
of controversial, or

00:44:58.330 --> 00:45:01.320
thought-provoking topic that's
brought up in these articles

00:45:01.320 --> 00:45:06.250
was the idea that if we reach
a state where so many jobs are

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:08.560
eliminated and
automation takes over,

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.660
we'll really be in
a state of abundance

00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:14.980
rather than deficiency.

00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:16.972
So they bring up
the idea of we'll

00:45:16.972 --> 00:45:19.180
still have to figure out
how to allocate these goods,

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:22.150
and allocate how much money
people have even there's

00:45:22.150 --> 00:45:23.830
no jobs for working.

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:27.290
So I think that's a pretty crazy
thing to think about right now.

00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:29.842
But I'd be interested
to hear what you

00:45:29.842 --> 00:45:31.050
think could happen with that.

00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:31.300
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:33.550
In other words, if we're
aiming at ever more efficient

00:45:33.550 --> 00:45:36.710
production, we're going to
create productivity gains,

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:39.490
which in turn generate
new resources in a society

00:45:39.490 --> 00:45:43.090
that you could use for
additional societal well-being.

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:46.210
So that's the
society-wide picture.

00:45:46.210 --> 00:45:47.860
But then if you
look at it in terms

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:51.070
of a particular line of
goods, or a particular region,

00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:54.700
there is more wealth potentially
being created, right,

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:56.440
for any given line of goods.

00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:58.210
And that indeed
can be distributed,

00:45:58.210 --> 00:46:01.750
and that can be a part of
a new kind of employee,

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:03.670
a new kind of
generation of employees,

00:46:03.670 --> 00:46:05.170
and what their return is.

00:46:05.170 --> 00:46:06.460
AUDIENCE: Mm-hmm.

00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:10.010
So I guess, kind of what do you
see as a hypothetical picture

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:11.038
for how that would work?

00:46:11.038 --> 00:46:12.580
Is this something
that the government

00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:14.460
would have to kind of regulate?

00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:16.140
Is this coming from the markets?

00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:17.220
AUDIENCE: Are you talking
about like universal income

00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:17.965
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:17.965 --> 00:46:18.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:46:18.590 --> 00:46:19.760
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.260
Anybody have interest in that?

00:46:22.260 --> 00:46:24.742
No, I'm not too socialist.

00:46:24.742 --> 00:46:26.450
AUDIENCE: I was going
to make an analogy.

00:46:29.530 --> 00:46:31.532
I have heard this is a fact.

00:46:31.532 --> 00:46:32.990
I have not done
research on it so I

00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:34.940
don't know if it's speculation,
but the way in which

00:46:34.940 --> 00:46:36.470
the diamond industry
operates, which

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:38.220
is that there is an
abundance of diamonds,

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:40.070
but there is a
control of the market,

00:46:40.070 --> 00:46:43.190
and thus they raise the price
on the diamond significantly.

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:46.390
And so the reason I bring
this as an example in which

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:50.947
to draw a parallel is because
universal basic income,

00:46:50.947 --> 00:46:53.280
and the both of you, I think
the place where both of you

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.460
are coming from, is an
assumption that people

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:57.590
want to distribute
those resources, right?

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.420
And that people
want other-- that we

00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:02.450
want to create those
productivity gains

00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:05.930
rather than decrease, or rather
if we increase our productivity

00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:08.270
gains, then we
won't act upon them.

00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:10.040
And I don't necessarily--

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:12.050
I don't know if that's true.

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.237
And that's, I think my concern.

00:47:14.237 --> 00:47:15.320
AUDIENCE: Can you clarify?

00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.280
AUDIENCE: Like, just because
we can make more, say, food.

00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.850
Just because we will have the
capacity to make more food

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:24.980
doesn't mean we will.

00:47:24.980 --> 00:47:27.290
Just because we have
the capacity to--

00:47:27.290 --> 00:47:29.930
AUDIENCE: Or doesn't mean that
everyone will be, on a whole,

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:30.698
healthier.

00:47:30.698 --> 00:47:31.365
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:47:31.365 --> 00:47:32.115
AUDIENCE: Oh yeah.

00:47:32.115 --> 00:47:34.340
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:47:34.340 --> 00:47:37.820
Just because we will have
access to more things,

00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.770
and we will have more rapid
access to these goods,

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:45.560
does not mean that
it will be a--

00:47:45.560 --> 00:47:49.700
that people will have access to
them, or that it will be like

00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:51.620
you were saying a
good thing overall.

00:47:51.620 --> 00:47:54.320
AUDIENCE: I mean I
think the idea of giving

00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:56.420
people hope that if
they lose their job

00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.550
their whole life isn't
going to really, really suck

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:02.375
and they'll be
poor is important.

00:48:02.375 --> 00:48:05.000
I don't know if universal basic
income would be the best thing,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.588
just because the incentives.

00:48:07.588 --> 00:48:10.130
And I think that will be really
a question of our generation.

00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:12.980
Like, how do you make sure
that these people end up

00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.540
having a place in society,
and being productive?

00:48:15.540 --> 00:48:18.440
And not going into depression,
or not spending their days just

00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:20.150
like not doing anything.

00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:21.340
Like, how do you--

00:48:21.340 --> 00:48:24.380
I think a big thing that will
have to happen, probably,

00:48:24.380 --> 00:48:26.690
is that governments, or
even private organizations,

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.720
because governments now might
not be adequate at this,

00:48:29.720 --> 00:48:31.220
will need to figure
out key business

00:48:31.220 --> 00:48:35.150
opportunities for
micro entrepreneurs

00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:37.760
that could give them
sustainable income,

00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:40.240
and give them the
ability to capital lines

00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:45.140
so that they'd be able to
generate wealth and create

00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:47.360
businesses in areas that
need these businesses.

00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:49.220
Because I think a lot of the
problem is in businesses.

00:48:49.220 --> 00:48:50.320
Like, you start a business
and you don't know

00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:51.440
if you will succeed or not.

00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:52.940
But if somebody
could do an analysis

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.100
like they do for McDonald's,
where it's like, OK,

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.490
we know this area this
will be successful.

00:48:56.490 --> 00:48:57.160
We know there's a need.

00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:59.320
The government probably
knows where there's needs.

00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.028
If you can do an
analysis to figure out--

00:49:01.028 --> 00:49:02.870
data to figure
out, OK, a company

00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:04.160
that does this would
be really useful here,

00:49:04.160 --> 00:49:06.180
a company that does this
would be really useful here.

00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.472
These will be the requirements.

00:49:07.472 --> 00:49:11.000
You can do a franchise model
for people to start companies.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.340
I'm not against like
universal basic income.

00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:15.523
I just worry about the
incentives of not having

00:49:15.523 --> 00:49:17.440
the ability-- or maybe
you create an incentive

00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.050
that you study and
you become a teacher.

00:49:20.050 --> 00:49:23.000
It's a thing that, no
matter what you say--

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.270
I can say like what it is, but
it's more about how you do it.

00:49:26.270 --> 00:49:27.980
Because you could
incentivize and create

00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:30.215
more teachers, but if you
don't respect those teachers,

00:49:30.215 --> 00:49:32.270
or if they don't value them,
then it'll be very weird.

00:49:32.270 --> 00:49:34.220
If you create it and
people just use the money

00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.137
and build these businesses,
and they're really

00:49:36.137 --> 00:49:39.270
going out and having
fun, I don't know.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.630
AUDIENCE: I think for me,
universal basic income is one

00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:43.922
of those things where like
economists really talk about

00:49:43.922 --> 00:49:52.110
and we can, in a sense, there's
like a lot of literature

00:49:52.110 --> 00:49:55.290
and kind of journal articles
kind of fielding this idea like

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:57.340
what if we don't.

00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:58.897
But in the US,
I'm trying to see,

00:49:58.897 --> 00:50:01.230
if we have this sort of
widening of this barbell effect,

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:03.622
where we had this erosion
of this middle class,

00:50:03.622 --> 00:50:04.830
and kind of like this large--

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:11.400
like, basically the
people getting rich

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.950
aren't increasing in
number fast enough,

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:15.510
but like, there's
a lot of people

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:17.070
kind of regressing this way.

00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:19.830
And so I'm trying to see like,
what are the conditions that

00:50:19.830 --> 00:50:22.858
will allow for us to call
for a universal basic income?

00:50:22.858 --> 00:50:24.900
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Rashid,
I think you're really

00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:27.540
onto an important point here.

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:34.230
If you've got a declining
middle class, their incentives

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:38.190
to, in effect, take money
out of their own incomes

00:50:38.190 --> 00:50:41.063
and redistribute them,
that's going to be a problem.

00:50:41.063 --> 00:50:43.230
If that's a threatened
community, which increasingly

00:50:43.230 --> 00:50:48.480
it is, then politically, that is
a very difficult step to take.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.120
So I would argue
that we probably

00:50:51.120 --> 00:50:53.340
need to look at education,
which is a great way

00:50:53.340 --> 00:50:56.820
to lead into our next reading.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.750
So another terrific
David Autor piece.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:03.090
David, for my money is doing
the best work in economics

00:51:03.090 --> 00:51:03.968
anywhere.

00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.800
This is his-- this builds
on the Goldin and Katz piece

00:51:10.800 --> 00:51:12.510
that we talked about
in the last class,

00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:15.600
right, and kind of takes it
another kind of step further.

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:22.710
And this piece is
all about skills,

00:51:22.710 --> 00:51:27.100
and education, and the rise
of earnings inequality.

00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:33.720
And now, there is a
steep and persistent rise

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:35.430
of earnings inequality
in the US labor

00:51:35.430 --> 00:51:37.770
market that has been going
on for more than a couple

00:51:37.770 --> 00:51:39.840
of decades now.

00:51:39.840 --> 00:51:41.730
And it's not just true
in the United States.

00:51:41.730 --> 00:51:47.370
This is a phenomenon in the
developed world in general.

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:48.942
But why look at inequality?

00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:53.760
And what do we start to see?

00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.940
First, the earnings
premium for education

00:51:56.940 --> 00:52:03.810
has risen very significantly
as we talked about last week.

00:52:03.810 --> 00:52:07.940
So 2/3 of the overall rise of
earning dispersion between 1980

00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:11.780
and 2005 is accounted for by
this increased premium that's

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:14.300
associated with
schooling in general,

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.390
and post-secondary
education in particular.

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.640
So let me just jump
to a slide of this.

00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.730
So this is a projection
that comes out

00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:24.710
of the quite respected
Georgetown University

00:52:24.710 --> 00:52:26.540
Center on Education
and Workforce, which

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:31.280
does really first-rate
work on the workforce.

00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:36.500
And they found that looking at
what projections were for 2024,

00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:40.130
they found that in
terms of job openings,

00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:42.740
high school diploma and less
than a high school diploma

00:52:42.740 --> 00:52:45.320
was going to be about
19.7 million job

00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:47.960
openings in that time period.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:51.140
Job openings for those with
college associate degrees--

00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:55.100
some college associate degrees
and college plus college--

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:57.830
36.5 million jobs, right?

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:02.540
So this is a profound
upskilling of the workforce

00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.700
that's going on.

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:07.970
And look, by the way, the
higher education system

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:11.190
isn't necessarily going
to produce these numbers.

00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:13.737
So what that means is that
the people on this end

00:53:13.737 --> 00:53:16.070
are going to be able to charge
a premium because there's

00:53:16.070 --> 00:53:18.560
going to be a shortage of
demand for their skill sets.

00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:19.730
That's what's going on.

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.170
That's what David
Autor is telling

00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:26.270
us has been going on now for
several decades in the US.

00:53:26.270 --> 00:53:30.020
It's exactly that phenomena.

00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:37.930
And the earnings gap, then,
between college and high school

00:53:37.930 --> 00:53:40.270
graduates has more than
doubled in the United States

00:53:40.270 --> 00:53:43.340
over the last three decades.

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:47.000
So lifetime earnings expectation
with a college degree

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.540
is now very powerful compared
to your lifetime earning

00:53:50.540 --> 00:53:55.400
expectation if you have
a high school degree.

00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:59.780
And the skill
premium concept here,

00:53:59.780 --> 00:54:03.950
offers real insight into
the evolution of inequality

00:54:03.950 --> 00:54:04.700
in the US society.

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:08.750
Now of course, this is all
related to the employment

00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:11.390
issues, and particularly
the future employment

00:54:11.390 --> 00:54:15.580
issues that we've just
been talking about.

00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:18.460
One more statistic
that underscores this.

00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:20.185
This is the fall
in real earnings.

00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:27.760
In a Hamilton project study
that was done for Brookings,

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:30.040
this is the percentage
of real earnings

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:38.370
in working age from 1990 to
2013 for men aged 30 to 45.

00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:41.490
No high school diploma,
median income decline

00:54:41.490 --> 00:54:44.880
went down 20 points
in that time period.

00:54:44.880 --> 00:54:50.570
High school diploma down 13
points in that time period.

00:54:50.570 --> 00:54:53.570
So we've got a profound
societal issue.

00:54:53.570 --> 00:54:58.070
This is just a big signal
of an inequality problem

00:54:58.070 --> 00:55:01.340
that's a problem now, and
because of the phenomenon

00:55:01.340 --> 00:55:05.990
we've just been talking about
in two previous readings.

00:55:05.990 --> 00:55:09.510
Is potentially going to get
significantly worse over time.

00:55:09.510 --> 00:55:11.360
So this is a big
societal dilemma

00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:14.750
that you guys are going to
have to figure out, right?

00:55:14.750 --> 00:55:19.970
And it looks like Autor is
telling us that a lot of this

00:55:19.970 --> 00:55:21.980
has to do with the
education system.

00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:23.900
How are we going to
alter the education

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:28.940
system to move a lot of people
to higher levels of education?

00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:30.980
How is that phenomenon
going to work?

00:55:30.980 --> 00:55:33.170
What are we going to do
in terms of designing

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:37.140
new institutions and new
mechanisms to do that?

00:55:37.140 --> 00:55:40.310
So the rising demand
for educated labor

00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:45.590
in advanced economies, including
the US, it's a profound rise.

00:55:45.590 --> 00:55:47.540
And if the supply
of educated workers

00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:50.660
doesn't keep pace with the
persistent outward shifts

00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.140
in demand for the
skills, then you just

00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:58.580
multiply your
inequality problem.

00:55:58.580 --> 00:56:06.540
And it forces a public policy
response around upskilling,

00:56:06.540 --> 00:56:07.040
right?

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.190
That's a societal task we're
going to have to accomplish.

00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:13.730
Now, Rashid pointed out,
I think very astutely,

00:56:13.730 --> 00:56:16.760
that, with this
barbell phenomena,

00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.970
which is another David
Autor concept, right,

00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:22.220
that the society looks
increasingly like a barbell.

00:56:22.220 --> 00:56:26.360
You've got a very successful
and growing upper middle class,

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.410
you've got the middle
of the economy,

00:56:28.410 --> 00:56:31.130
which is being in
decline and being--

00:56:31.130 --> 00:56:33.440
we just saw the
median income data--

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:38.690
and moving towards lower-end
service delivery jobs, right?

00:56:38.690 --> 00:56:43.880
Personal service delivery
kinds of positions.

00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:48.740
The politics of that make
it problematic to deal with,

00:56:48.740 --> 00:56:51.050
say income distribution
in the United States.

00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:54.170
It's just not going to
be politically simple.

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:55.910
If everybody was
rising together that's

00:56:55.910 --> 00:56:57.670
an easier problem to tackle.

00:56:57.670 --> 00:56:59.600
But they're not.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:02.450
So education is probably
the way in which we're

00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:04.150
going to have to address this.

00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.872
All right?

00:57:04.872 --> 00:57:06.830
We're going to have to
up skill that workforce.

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:10.260
And look, by doing that,
as Martin pointed out,

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.050
you're addressing the
underlying problem.

00:57:12.050 --> 00:57:14.750
You're helping people
realize their talents

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:16.940
and their capabilities, right?

00:57:16.940 --> 00:57:20.540
And that's, frankly,
a better solution

00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:22.880
to the problem than just
throwing money at people,

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:24.020
I would argue, right?

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:25.730
It's probably not the
only thing you do,

00:57:25.730 --> 00:57:27.920
and it's not going
to help everybody,

00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:32.630
but can we find
strategies to do this?

00:57:32.630 --> 00:57:35.750
So I've been working on this,
and I've been thinking about it

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:41.720
and talking to Sanjay Sarma,
who runs the online education

00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:46.820
effort at MIT, and MIT has
developed these new platform

00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:47.700
technologies.

00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.200
MITx and edX is another
platform provider,

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.840
pervasive online capability.

00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:57.350
But on the other hand,
it's hard to envision

00:57:57.350 --> 00:57:59.480
a steelworker in
southeastern Ohio

00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:04.080
who's lost their job, at
being willing or able to spend

00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.620
a substantial amount of
time in front of a computer

00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:09.037
blue screen in their basement
while their kids are running

00:58:09.037 --> 00:58:10.100
around upstairs, right?

00:58:10.100 --> 00:58:11.342
Just not terribly likely.

00:58:11.342 --> 00:58:13.550
AUDIENCE: Or, if there was
a case brought up recently

00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:15.820
that somebody was worried about
losing their job because they

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.860
would lose their insurance,
and their kid might not be

00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:19.040
able to get proper [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:20.582
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yes, the problems

00:58:20.582 --> 00:58:22.960
multiply when you
get into this box.

00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:25.820
And we've had two
recent-- recently two

00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.130
very interesting
books that start

00:58:28.130 --> 00:58:32.580
to portray this problem for us.

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:38.570
And so Hillbillology is a
very interesting story of one

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:43.430
of the big diasporas in US
history out of the South,

00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:47.570
out of the Appalachians,
into industrial employment

00:58:47.570 --> 00:58:49.070
in the Middle West.

00:58:49.070 --> 00:58:51.020
And with the decline
of US manufacturing,

00:58:51.020 --> 00:58:53.450
that community
really got nailed.

00:58:53.450 --> 00:58:55.410
And what do you do
with that community?

00:58:55.410 --> 00:58:58.190
This book is a pay-on
to that community,

00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:00.980
and how to even think
about the kind of problems

00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.120
they've got into.

00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:05.060
Opioids are one example
cited in that book.

00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:10.910
There's a new book just
out by Annie Goldstein

00:59:10.910 --> 00:59:16.550
about a town in Wisconsin.

00:59:16.550 --> 00:59:18.800
Town of about 60,000 people.

00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.785
The major employer was
a General Motors plant

00:59:21.785 --> 00:59:24.110
that employed 9,000 people.

00:59:24.110 --> 00:59:26.690
It had survived the Rust
Belt. It was a quality plant.

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:30.740
But when General Motors
went bankrupt in 2008,

00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.980
all those people lost their
jobs, every single one of them.

00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.470
And it put that community--

00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:38.840
tax revenues declined,
housing values

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:41.690
declined, everything
is going down, right?

00:59:41.690 --> 00:59:46.590
Community services collapse,
charitable contributions drop,

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:48.500
right?

00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.410
It's painful to watch what
happens in that community.

00:59:51.410 --> 00:59:53.390
Finally, one good thing happens.

00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:56.630
Dollar store opens a
distribution plant.

00:59:56.630 --> 00:59:58.460
The jobs pay way less
than half of what

00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:01.010
the General Motors jobs paid.

01:00:01.010 --> 01:00:03.640
So that's the kind of problem
that we're up against here.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.510
And in light of all
we've just been talking

01:00:05.510 --> 01:00:07.910
about technological job
displacement occurring

01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:11.810
over time, we've got
a big upskilling job

01:00:11.810 --> 01:00:15.320
to do here, I would
argue, in our economy.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:20.180
So online capabilities are
one piece, but that's not

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:21.520
going to be the answer here.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.270
It's probably going
to be a blended model.

01:00:23.270 --> 01:00:26.600
And can we think about how
to enlist community colleges,

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:29.600
and how to join them
with universities

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:30.680
developing curriculum?

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.750
And how do we know
what the curriculum is?

01:00:32.750 --> 01:00:36.200
What's the content education
in a society that's going

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:38.000
to change the nature of work?

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.560
How do we begin to
understand that?

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.990
What's the changing nature of
work that these technologies

01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:43.290
are going to drive?

01:00:43.290 --> 01:00:44.450
How do we educate for that?

01:00:44.450 --> 01:00:46.940
So we've got a big task ahead.

01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:49.050
But a mix of employers,
community colleges,

01:00:49.050 --> 01:00:51.560
universities, and
labor organizations

01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:54.140
is probably going to be the way
we try to figure some of this

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:55.100
out.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.850
So I'm just extrapolating
from David Autor's point

01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:01.070
about the underlying
importance of education

01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:03.867
to this inequality
problem, and emphasizing

01:01:03.867 --> 01:01:05.450
that education is
probably going to be

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:07.580
the fix we're going to use.

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.380
But then, how are going
to do that, right?

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:11.420
So a big challenging problem.

01:01:11.420 --> 01:01:13.867
So who's got this one?

01:01:13.867 --> 01:01:15.950
Sanam, you want to lead
us through some questions?

01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:17.723
AUDIENCE: Sure.

01:01:17.723 --> 01:01:18.890
Yeah, so a couple of points.

01:01:18.890 --> 01:01:20.630
I thought the
focus on inequality

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:23.000
was really interesting
here, especially

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.690
he touches on briefly why
inequality is actually

01:01:26.690 --> 01:01:27.733
good for innovation.

01:01:27.733 --> 01:01:29.150
And this is something
that we talk

01:01:29.150 --> 01:01:32.640
a lot of that in econ classes,
and how, of course there

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.430
are greater
incentives to be more

01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:36.980
productive because the rewards
and returns are better.

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:39.410
And then also,
generally in countries

01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:43.942
that have more unequal
distributions of income,

01:01:43.942 --> 01:01:45.650
that attracts people
from other countries

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:48.560
with more equal distribution of
income to come to that country

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.100
and stay.

01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:52.970
So in terms of attracting
talent for our innovation system

01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:55.500
from abroad, it's actually
kind of a benefit.

01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.150
But obviously there
are a lot of problems

01:01:58.150 --> 01:02:00.320
as well that she talks about.

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:04.940
Especially the intergenerational
mobility problem.

01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:09.890
So that there's a decline
in wages for people who

01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:11.510
are not in college educated.

01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:14.570
And that tends to perpetuate
within families and communities

01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:15.570
as well.

01:02:15.570 --> 01:02:19.260
So one of my big
questions here, which

01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:22.250
is just kind of a
general question,

01:02:22.250 --> 01:02:25.070
is how do we make sure
that in discussions

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:27.620
about innovation and
technological advancement,

01:02:27.620 --> 01:02:30.790
that we address these problems
of systemic inequality, that

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:32.840
still persist in the country?

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:36.380
And kind of tying onto
that, to what extent

01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:40.190
are the systems of privilege
of educational and skill

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:42.465
advancement in attainment
embedded in this framework

01:02:42.465 --> 01:02:44.548
that we've been studying
throughout this semester?

01:02:44.548 --> 01:02:46.888
So I kind of want to get
your thoughts on that.

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:51.830
AUDIENCE: Can you repeat that?

01:02:51.830 --> 01:02:52.670
Just like the main question?

01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.970
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Why don't you

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:54.260
break them into the two pieces?

01:02:54.260 --> 01:02:55.135
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sure.

01:02:55.135 --> 01:02:58.437
So my first question was how--

01:02:58.437 --> 01:03:00.020
in these discussions
we've been having

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:03.110
about encouraging innovation
and technological advancement,

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:08.330
how do we address problems of
systemic inequality as well?

01:03:08.330 --> 01:03:10.580
AUDIENCE: Just for the
limiting down of your question,

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:14.510
would you mind
defining for us what

01:03:14.510 --> 01:03:17.090
is systemic inequality
is in your definition?

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:20.150
Because I have my own very
many definitions, right, around

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:22.520
my field in political science.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.230
And then, two, what
systemic inequalities

01:03:24.230 --> 01:03:25.070
do you want to talk about?

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:25.700
Is it race?

01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:26.870
IS it income inequality?

01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:27.930
Is it social class?

01:03:27.930 --> 01:03:28.990
Is it what durable inequalities?

01:03:28.990 --> 01:03:30.250
AUDIENCE: Educational
disparities?

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:30.875
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:03:30.875 --> 01:03:33.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, so I'm going
to go up with Autor's piece was

01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:35.630
and talk about--

01:03:35.630 --> 01:03:37.340
so by systemic
inequality he was talking

01:03:37.340 --> 01:03:40.910
about how the
educational attainment

01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:43.190
gap tends to persist
within families,

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:45.910
and then extrapolate that into
like larger communities which

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:47.810
these families are in.

01:03:47.810 --> 01:03:51.600
And then it just kind of gets
perpetuated in that sense.

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:54.050
So I think, maybe
specifically talk

01:03:54.050 --> 01:03:57.710
about like when it comes
to educational attainment,

01:03:57.710 --> 01:04:01.160
and then the later on how
that translates into income

01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.860
and into wages.

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:09.720
We can just talk about how that
kind of factors in [INAUDIBLE]..

01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.100
AUDIENCE: Bernie had it right.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.720
Free education.

01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.600
That's the crux.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.683
AUDIENCE: I think there's
an important point here

01:04:17.683 --> 01:04:19.600
that you said about
intergenerational mobility

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:21.810
and educational attainment.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:23.640
And now that there's
just this transition

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.640
in this additional premium
on like having a bachelors

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:31.650
and a post-secondary
degree that didn't exist,

01:04:31.650 --> 01:04:33.948
but like it's sort of
too late to fix that once

01:04:33.948 --> 01:04:36.240
you've already matriculated
sort of into the workforce.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:39.900
And now, I mean, I don't have
my post-secondary or college

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:43.230
degree, but I'm 45 and I
have all these other problems

01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:44.190
to deal with.

01:04:44.190 --> 01:04:47.320
And so I think just
like maybe Bill

01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.558
was starting to say, like
there are some fixes with maybe

01:04:50.558 --> 01:04:52.350
community college and
kind of night classes

01:04:52.350 --> 01:04:59.670
that are like sort
of kind of segues

01:04:59.670 --> 01:05:03.480
back in to the system
of like getting back

01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.180
that educational premium
that maybe you didn't have

01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.590
the opportunity to previously.

01:05:07.590 --> 01:05:10.560
And I think maybe
that's a lot easier

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:13.650
than these giant kind
of skill retraining

01:05:13.650 --> 01:05:14.877
or repurposing maybe.

01:05:14.877 --> 01:05:16.460
I can imagine like
a larger gym filled

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.040
with like computers that
kind of people come in

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.420
and like take online
classes of how to do

01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:22.770
better or something like that.

01:05:22.770 --> 01:05:25.775
But you really have to
focus, I would say, on

01:05:25.775 --> 01:05:27.420
like there's this
large subset as we

01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:31.140
saw in this last election of
people who have shifted out

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.490
of jobs, particularly
in manufacturing,

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:36.265
who are intergenerationally
speaking on

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:39.000
like the I've been out of
school or been out of college

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:40.230
for 20 plus years.

01:05:40.230 --> 01:05:42.860
And like, is it too late for me
to go back, or switch, or gain

01:05:42.860 --> 01:05:45.177
these skills, these
educational skills that I need?

01:05:45.177 --> 01:05:46.260
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:49.740
So Rashid, I think you make
a very good point here.

01:05:49.740 --> 01:05:53.970
We're going to need
that steelworker

01:05:53.970 --> 01:05:55.680
I was talking about
before who lost

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.743
his job in southeastern Ohio.

01:05:57.743 --> 01:05:59.910
He's not going to go back
and get a four-year degree

01:05:59.910 --> 01:06:00.660
in college.

01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:01.770
It is not going to happen.

01:06:01.770 --> 01:06:03.660
Whether Bernie wants
to make it free or not,

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.910
Lily, it's not going to happen.

01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:09.240
We need an entirely
different set

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.760
of institutional
models that's going

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.170
to work with this community.

01:06:13.170 --> 01:06:18.030
And as we have this
technological job

01:06:18.030 --> 01:06:19.230
displacement--

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:23.610
and I personally will talk
more about this later,

01:06:23.610 --> 01:06:25.560
I don't think this is
going to be something

01:06:25.560 --> 01:06:26.580
that happens tomorrow.

01:06:26.580 --> 01:06:28.980
I think we've got time to
work on this, all right?

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:32.010
I think it's going to be a
more gradual process than some

01:06:32.010 --> 01:06:36.240
of the technological
dystopians have portrayed.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.160
But we're going to
have to use that time,

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.868
and I think we're
going to have to create

01:06:39.868 --> 01:06:43.200
a whole new set of institutional
arrangements to begin to cope.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.730
Otherwise, we're just leaving
too many people behind.

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:49.087
And the price in our society
and the price in our democracy--

01:06:49.087 --> 01:06:51.420
as we just learned from the
last presidential election--

01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:53.760
is pretty high.

01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.040
That's my case, right?

01:06:55.040 --> 01:06:56.290
That's what I want to work on.

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:01.480
But other of you I know
have thoughts on this.

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:06.260
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:07.875
AUDIENCE: Three small thoughts.

01:07:07.875 --> 01:07:10.250
The first of which is that
this conversation is making me

01:07:10.250 --> 01:07:12.800
think of education as a
sort of social security

01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:15.090
for young people.

01:07:15.090 --> 01:07:16.427
That's our social safety net.

01:07:16.427 --> 01:07:18.135
AUDIENCE: Like it's
our insurance policy?

01:07:18.135 --> 01:07:18.740
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
it's our insurance.

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:19.090
AUDIENCE: OK.

01:07:19.090 --> 01:07:19.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:20.470
Yeah.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:23.690
And I mean I--

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:27.300
like I said earlier in the
semester, I took a course--

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:30.770
or I just finished yesterday,
a course in computer science.

01:07:30.770 --> 01:07:32.440
And it was so hard.

01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:35.640
I mean it was really
challenging and really positive

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.010
experience for me, personally.

01:07:38.010 --> 01:07:40.438
But I also, as I was
doing these assignments,

01:07:40.438 --> 01:07:42.480
considered what it would
be like to have a family

01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:45.240
and to have obligations
beyond myself,

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.880
and to have to be
retrained in a vocation.

01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:50.728
And that's almost
insurmountable.

01:07:50.728 --> 01:07:53.020
I can't imagine what it would
be like for my father who

01:07:53.020 --> 01:07:55.380
is a single income earner
in the service industry,

01:07:55.380 --> 01:07:57.450
to lose his job and
to have to think

01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:01.487
about the ways in which he can't
help our family anymore, right?

01:08:01.487 --> 01:08:02.820
I come from a low-income family.

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:05.610
That's a consideration
I have to have.

01:08:05.610 --> 01:08:10.080
And then secondly, about
not so much inequality,

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:14.370
but I did research for
a political science

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:17.779
course on global inequality
on waste pickers in the world,

01:08:17.779 --> 01:08:19.529
and the role that they
play in the economy

01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:22.229
specifically in solid waste
and the recycling process

01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:23.910
in the global supply chain.

01:08:23.910 --> 01:08:25.920
And one of the things
that came up a lot

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:29.100
was social exclusion
as the mechanism

01:08:29.100 --> 01:08:30.840
by which inequality happens.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:32.340
And I feel like we
need to talk more

01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.970
about things in the terminology
of social exclusion,

01:08:35.970 --> 01:08:38.370
because then we
understand how it happens

01:08:38.370 --> 01:08:41.700
and who commits
the action, and who

01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:43.109
is the receiver of the action.

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:45.067
AUDIENCE: What do you
mean by social exclusion?

01:08:45.067 --> 01:08:47.850
AUDIENCE: So social exclusion
is preventing individuals

01:08:47.850 --> 01:08:51.810
from accessing a sector as a
result of a durable inequality.

01:08:51.810 --> 01:08:53.580
And so I'll break
that down further.

01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:56.189
It's essentially in the
case of, say, waste pickers.

01:08:56.189 --> 01:08:58.770
The way in which they have
been excluded in, say, Brazil,

01:08:58.770 --> 01:09:01.750
from accessing education
because of their race.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:02.250
Right?

01:09:02.250 --> 01:09:04.170
So that's a very
complicated picture.

01:09:04.170 --> 01:09:08.680
But what we can determine
is that because families,

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:12.270
in sort of the middle and
upper class in Brazil,

01:09:12.270 --> 01:09:14.470
have always had
access to education,

01:09:14.470 --> 01:09:17.189
they want to sustain
that standard of living

01:09:17.189 --> 01:09:18.359
for their progeny.

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:20.520
And so then their
progeny gets educated.

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.160
But at the same
time, there's only so

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:25.402
many spots at the national
universities, right?

01:09:25.402 --> 01:09:26.819
And so those spots
are never going

01:09:26.819 --> 01:09:30.359
to go to the children of
the low income parents.

01:09:30.359 --> 01:09:32.910
They're always going to go
to the wealthier families.

01:09:32.910 --> 01:09:36.297
And if we think about things in
a process of social exclusion

01:09:36.297 --> 01:09:38.130
rather than inequality,
which is the outcome

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:42.000
of social exclusion, I think
we can start rectifying some--

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.760
at least some of the
dimensions by which

01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:46.200
we oppress other people.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.810
Because it's really easy to
say, oh, there's inequalities,

01:09:48.810 --> 01:09:50.560
and to identify all of them.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.109
But I think it's
much harder to think

01:09:52.109 --> 01:09:54.090
about the ways in which
we ourselves either

01:09:54.090 --> 01:09:57.690
uphold those inequalities,
perpetuate those inequalities,

01:09:57.690 --> 01:10:00.460
or benefit from those
inequalities, right?

01:10:00.460 --> 01:10:02.100
And so we have to,
I think that if we

01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:05.130
talk about things in the
language of exclusion,

01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:08.100
there's almost a responsibility
and accountability

01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:12.396
to the effects that
those exclusions have.

01:10:12.396 --> 01:10:13.890
AUDIENCE: What's the third one?

01:10:13.890 --> 01:10:16.410
AUDIENCE: And yeah I was
just-- that was little--

01:10:16.410 --> 01:10:20.730
I've had a lot of thoughts
about that for a long time.

01:10:20.730 --> 01:10:24.310
But I think it's
really important

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:26.310
that we are accountable
for the ways in which we

01:10:26.310 --> 01:10:27.720
benefit from inequalities.

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:29.430
And I'm not an exception.

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:30.548
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:10:30.548 --> 01:10:32.340
I had a quick point,
but if yours is quick.

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:34.850
I think to Steph's
point just super quick.

01:10:34.850 --> 01:10:36.630
I think there are
a lot of studies

01:10:36.630 --> 01:10:39.600
that say like,
inequality in a sense

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:44.187
like we're OK with, like,
it's OK that Martin makes

01:10:44.187 --> 01:10:46.770
more money than I did this week,
like, we're all OK with that.

01:10:46.770 --> 01:10:48.640
But I think in the
rising inequality,

01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:51.570
in this barbell effect,
like, you have people--

01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:53.040
like this growing
subset of people

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.960
who just aren't earning as much.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.360
And there's sort
of a lot of them.

01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.330
And there's not really this
distribution of inequality,

01:11:00.330 --> 01:11:04.650
then we get to say, we
have more reason to say,

01:11:04.650 --> 01:11:06.840
like, I'm not OK with
once I have less.

01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.660
And then I think there's a
difference between inequality

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.870
and unfairness, which I think
Steph was trying to get at.

01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:15.833
And it's when unfairness
in a sense like,

01:11:15.833 --> 01:11:17.250
I didn't have the
same opportunity

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:19.580
that Martin did to
get to that point.

01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:21.690
Like, I didn't have the
same college education

01:11:21.690 --> 01:11:25.470
that Martin did to get to
that point, that's sort

01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:26.710
of when these problems arise.

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:29.130
And I think once we
have this rising--

01:11:29.130 --> 01:11:31.180
we have sort of a rising
sentiment of inequality,

01:11:31.180 --> 01:11:33.180
and I think it's going
to be a lot easier for us

01:11:33.180 --> 01:11:36.390
to say that these systems
are sort of bringing things

01:11:36.390 --> 01:11:37.928
that are kind of on the whole.

01:11:37.928 --> 01:11:40.470
And so the systems are unfair
and causing these inequalities,

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:45.090
and now we can have, I'm going
to say political pressure,

01:11:45.090 --> 01:11:46.590
and not kind of
the social impetus

01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:49.157
to really change things.

01:11:49.157 --> 01:11:51.240
AUDIENCE: I'll make one
quick point on this paper,

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.637
and then one on just inequity.

01:11:53.637 --> 01:11:55.470
So what's interesting
to me about this paper

01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:57.930
is that there is another
article that came out

01:11:57.930 --> 01:12:00.070
about inequality in education.

01:12:00.070 --> 01:12:02.160
On, it was like one of
the major publications,

01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:04.050
like Time or Wall
Street Journal.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:06.550
And what they did is they looked
at people who actually went

01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:09.090
to college that were
minorities or from low income

01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:10.020
versus high income.

01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:10.320
Yeah.

01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.903
But what they did
is they mapped where

01:12:11.903 --> 01:12:13.260
they were like in the future.

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:15.780
And it turned out that it was
pretty much the same, right?

01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:17.558
So they don't go up the ladder.

01:12:17.558 --> 01:12:19.350
And so what I question
when I see something

01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:22.820
like this is like, OK, well
if you actually go and get

01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:25.300
a college education are
you better off financially?

01:12:25.300 --> 01:12:27.720
And is that the
metric of success?

01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:30.090
You might get personal
fulfillment, better lifestyle.

01:12:30.090 --> 01:12:31.890
But I think it's a
flawed idea to say

01:12:31.890 --> 01:12:33.390
if you go to college
you will end up

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:34.910
making more money that way.

01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:36.910
Because it might have
been based on the paradigm

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:39.077
then in the '50s, yeah,
you'd get a really good job,

01:12:39.077 --> 01:12:41.867
and you have great benefits.

01:12:41.867 --> 01:12:43.950
But to start to say that,
OK, if you go to college

01:12:43.950 --> 01:12:44.910
then you'll be set.

01:12:44.910 --> 01:12:46.440
And then to say, OK, we
just need to get everybody

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.400
through college.

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:50.170
That's a very big
bubble mentality.

01:12:50.170 --> 01:12:52.570
And I think we'll be
paying very heavily for it.

01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:55.777
I just recently saw an
interview on like Goldman Sachs,

01:12:55.777 --> 01:12:57.360
and how they saw the
financial crisis.

01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.027
And they explained
it in terms of, well,

01:12:59.027 --> 01:13:00.585
we built the road, right?

01:13:00.585 --> 01:13:02.460
But when we were giving
out these securities,

01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:04.460
we didn't make decision
put our money into them.

01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:06.150
It was all these
people were trying to--

01:13:06.150 --> 01:13:08.160
they thought that this
was the factor to success

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.210
and kept buying them
and buying them.

01:13:09.210 --> 01:13:10.560
Every time they bought one
they would crack the road,

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.852
crack the road, crack the road.

01:13:11.852 --> 01:13:14.760
But we had the duty to give
certain kinds of bonds,

01:13:14.760 --> 01:13:17.880
and other people sold them
again, which we didn't do.

01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:21.143
And so ultimately we get--

01:13:21.143 --> 01:13:23.810
it's easy to point the finger at
us because the road was broken.

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:25.602
But it's because the
actions of individuals

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:28.940
buying, and buying, and
buying, going into grief.

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:31.380
And so I think that's
an interesting point.

01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:32.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So that
is an example of a bubble

01:13:32.940 --> 01:13:33.480
economy [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.355
AUDIENCE: A bubble
economy, yeah.

01:13:34.355 --> 01:13:35.410
And also this point--

01:13:35.410 --> 01:13:37.160
and I think Stephanie's point--

01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:38.110
I forget which one--

01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:41.400
on, oh, the insurance policy
was made by Peter Thiel

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:44.440
in 2010 about why--

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.200
he questioned if
you go to college

01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:48.740
would you be better off?

01:13:48.740 --> 01:13:51.270
And so that's not an
inequality of education.

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:55.110
On the issue of inequity what
I find really interesting

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:58.290
is that we talk about
equality, but we're

01:13:58.290 --> 01:14:00.930
living in a relatively
prosperous time.

01:14:00.930 --> 01:14:03.343
Also, the US, it is a
land of opportunity.

01:14:03.343 --> 01:14:05.760
And so I thought it was really
interesting, or even ironic

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.560
during the 1%
movement, that it was

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:11.370
like the 1% of the world
getting angry at the 1%.

01:14:11.370 --> 01:14:13.380
And it is this
thing that we have

01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:15.500
this kind of social
contract that in the US

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:19.300
you will be able to
advance and move forward.

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:21.040
But I think inequity
is a big issue.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.550
Like, how do you make it
so that people can move up?

01:14:23.550 --> 01:14:26.160
Warren Buffett talks
about the lottery of life.

01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:29.100
That say you were about to
be born in five minutes.

01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:31.490
If you had to design
the world any which way,

01:14:31.490 --> 01:14:32.360
and you don't know
if you're going

01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:33.710
to be born a woman,
a man, if you're

01:14:33.710 --> 01:14:35.460
going to be born
disabled, if you're going

01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:37.140
to be born mentally retarded.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:37.330
AUDIENCE: With a
mental disability.

01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:39.150
AUDIENCE: Or if you're
going to be born--

01:14:39.150 --> 01:14:40.060
you know what I mean.

01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.060
If you would be born
somewhere else in the world

01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:43.200
where you don't
have an opportunity

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.575
and you have to pick up scraps
for the rest of your life.

01:14:45.575 --> 01:14:47.840
What kind of world would
you want to create,

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.168
and how do you go
building about that world?

01:14:50.168 --> 01:14:51.960
And I think that's a
really interesting way

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:52.830
of looking at it.

01:14:52.830 --> 01:14:55.550
Because really, I don't think
equal outcome I don't think

01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:56.670
will ever be a thing.

01:14:56.670 --> 01:14:59.370
And to say that that will be
a thing is a very flawed idea

01:14:59.370 --> 01:15:02.940
and would just
lead to self-anger,

01:15:02.940 --> 01:15:04.860
and you will get
jealousy of other people.

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:07.620
There's also things in
life that you can't buy.

01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:09.510
If you focus on
building that, if you

01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:12.360
build great relationships,
if you're good to people

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.710
they'll be good to you.

01:15:13.710 --> 01:15:15.252
Because there's a
lot of billionaires

01:15:15.252 --> 01:15:16.770
that everybody hates them.

01:15:16.770 --> 01:15:19.710
You can look at the
President, right?

01:15:19.710 --> 01:15:22.013
And so I think
that's a big issue.

01:15:22.013 --> 01:15:23.180
And there's just been that--

01:15:23.180 --> 01:15:25.290
well, there's also the idea
of a capitalist society

01:15:25.290 --> 01:15:26.850
where we have to have
these figureheads that

01:15:26.850 --> 01:15:27.683
made a lot of money.

01:15:27.683 --> 01:15:29.350
And we have to have
the proper incentive

01:15:29.350 --> 01:15:30.690
to want to become like them.

01:15:30.690 --> 01:15:31.800
And we have to push that--

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.750
that's why the system is built
for us to want to revere people

01:15:34.750 --> 01:15:37.710
on the Forbes list, so
that we can continue

01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:39.270
growing capitalistically.

01:15:39.270 --> 01:15:40.650
But I think definitely what
will happen-- especially

01:15:40.650 --> 01:15:42.108
my generation-- is
people are going

01:15:42.108 --> 01:15:44.490
to start to question capitalism,
especially the issues

01:15:44.490 --> 01:15:45.578
that Marx brought up.

01:15:45.578 --> 01:15:47.370
So that we'll say, how
do we build a better

01:15:47.370 --> 01:15:52.090
capitalist system where
we can be better humans?

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:55.162
Or there might be a lot
more assholes, I don't know.

01:15:55.162 --> 01:16:00.990
AUDIENCE: Also to Martin's
point about your college degree

01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.180
may not be the
right path, or it's

01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:06.240
kind of hazardous to say that if
we just give everyone a college

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.183
degree and kind
of subsidize that,

01:16:08.183 --> 01:16:10.350
they'll just make higher
incomes and like everything

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:11.310
will be fine.

01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:14.890
I think there's-- and I can't
remember which slide it was.

01:16:14.890 --> 01:16:18.565
Like, what percent-- like
what degree level and like

01:16:18.565 --> 01:16:19.690
how it affects your income.

01:16:19.690 --> 01:16:20.930
AUDIENCE: The change
in real earnings?

01:16:20.930 --> 01:16:22.763
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the
change in real earnings.

01:16:24.112 --> 01:16:25.320
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: This one?

01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:27.750
AUDIENCE: This one.

01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:29.030
AUDIENCE: Seems uneven.

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:30.150
AUDIENCE: It seems uneven.

01:16:30.150 --> 01:16:35.520
But I think there's something
to be said about kind

01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:37.590
of generational nobility here.

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:41.070
So like those who had a
bachelors degree coming out

01:16:41.070 --> 01:16:43.230
in maybe 1970 or a
little bit earlier,

01:16:43.230 --> 01:16:46.770
that income level was
relative to the time.

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.930
Like, it allowed me
to live comfortably,

01:16:48.930 --> 01:16:51.153
whereas my bachelor's
degree now,

01:16:51.153 --> 01:16:53.070
and whatever bump in
income level I get, like,

01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:54.220
am I living comfortably?

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:57.000
Am I going to be
able to subsist?

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.977
And that might be
like an indicator

01:16:58.977 --> 01:17:00.810
where it's like, yeah,
it's unequal in here,

01:17:00.810 --> 01:17:03.360
but like there's actually a
bigger social problem here.

01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.990
So even though I might be
making more than I was in 1990,

01:17:06.990 --> 01:17:11.160
like is my 1990 salary, at
that level is it enough for me

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.030
to live in 1990?

01:17:12.030 --> 01:17:14.060
And like, is my 2013
salary, is that enough?

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.727
AUDIENCE: These are
real earning, right?

01:17:15.727 --> 01:17:18.100
So these are
inflation adjusting.

01:17:18.100 --> 01:17:18.600
Yeah.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:19.225
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:17:19.225 --> 01:17:21.355
Inflation adjusted, but
like cost of living.

01:17:21.355 --> 01:17:22.730
AUDIENCE: There's
also one factor

01:17:22.730 --> 01:17:24.240
I think is really important.

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.550
And I think the recent
election showcased--

01:17:26.550 --> 01:17:27.250
were you done with your point?

01:17:27.250 --> 01:17:27.875
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:17:27.875 --> 01:17:28.937
No, I'm done.

01:17:28.937 --> 01:17:31.520
AUDIENCE: Which is, I think the
real issue happening right now

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:34.640
is that we are in a stagnation
in terms of actual real term

01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:37.220
prospect-- like real
prosperity growth.

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:41.090
The numbers can say we grew,
but everything costs a lot more.

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:44.900
The way the system is
created to show that, oh,

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:45.860
we're doing well.

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.690
I think like the
poverty line, right,

01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:49.708
is flawed the way we're
calculating it now,

01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:51.500
because it's not really
showing what people

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.820
can buy with what they have.

01:17:52.820 --> 01:17:55.070
And that's how we create it.

01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:57.620
Because everything costs a lot
more, but they've adjusted it

01:17:57.620 --> 01:17:59.453
and they've fudged the
numbers in such a way

01:17:59.453 --> 01:18:01.310
that it seems to be
kind of a big picture.

01:18:01.310 --> 01:18:01.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So we're going to--

01:18:01.940 --> 01:18:03.440
Martin, we're going
to get into this

01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:05.232
when we get to the last
reading and lay out

01:18:05.232 --> 01:18:07.220
this whole issue of
secular stagnation,

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.130
and what the implications
of that historically

01:18:10.130 --> 01:18:13.430
low productivity rate we're at,
and historically low investment

01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:15.260
rates that we're at.

01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:16.610
And that may be--

01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:18.440
I think you're about
to drive at this--

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:23.280
that may be a really, big
time, near time problem.

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.820
Whereas the technological job
displacement maybe a little

01:18:25.820 --> 01:18:26.665
further off.

01:18:26.665 --> 01:18:27.290
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:27.930
AUDIENCE: Well,
yeah, I was going

01:18:27.930 --> 01:18:29.360
to finish with when
people don't see

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:31.040
like what is going
to be the next step,

01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.150
they kind of start
to lose hope and they

01:18:32.150 --> 01:18:34.400
start fighting over things
that really are non-issues.

01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:36.858
This happens in a lot-- it's
a common organizational thing.

01:18:36.858 --> 01:18:38.240
When you lose your
vision, people

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.615
start fighting
over really like--

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:41.550
very intensely--
about things that

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:43.640
maybe don't matter as
much, or wouldn't have been

01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.483
an issue when they had vision.

01:18:45.483 --> 01:18:47.150
And I think that's
one of the reasons we

01:18:47.150 --> 01:18:49.400
see such intense
infighting right now.

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.928
Because we're really
starting to question

01:18:51.928 --> 01:18:53.720
like what will-- well,
not really question,

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:54.960
but we should just
see America as it is,

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:56.602
and no one has said
this what America

01:18:56.602 --> 01:18:58.060
will be 50 years
from now and we'll

01:18:58.060 --> 01:19:00.020
start working towards that.

01:19:00.020 --> 01:19:03.140
And I think that's a big factor
that I saw in the last four

01:19:03.140 --> 01:19:04.262
years.

01:19:04.262 --> 01:19:05.720
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Sanam, you want

01:19:05.720 --> 01:19:09.290
to give us a closing point after
all of our discussions on this?

01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:11.330
AUDIENCE: There's a
slight point, I think.

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:12.872
We might be able to
talk about later,

01:19:12.872 --> 01:19:14.690
but like the GI Bill as like--

01:19:14.690 --> 01:19:17.330
I wanted to mention it as
like the last big, kind

01:19:17.330 --> 01:19:19.730
of governmentally-subsidized,
like, real movement

01:19:19.730 --> 01:19:24.050
towards kind of educating
en masse a large subset

01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:28.370
of the population for
the sake of education

01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:29.870
and all the other reasons.

01:19:29.870 --> 01:19:32.670
But there's [INAUDIBLE]
if I didn't say,

01:19:32.670 --> 01:19:36.392
there's a whole subset of like
social inequities that exist

01:19:36.392 --> 01:19:38.725
within the GI Bill that we
don't have to get into, but--

01:19:38.725 --> 01:19:40.267
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
But you're right.

01:19:40.267 --> 01:19:43.490
I mean, the two mass
higher education

01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:46.760
bills that the US did--
so the Land Grant College

01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:50.750
Act that created, in effect, the
institutional base, and the GI

01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:54.560
Bill that took this huge
population returning from World

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:57.230
War II and stuck
them in college,

01:19:57.230 --> 01:20:03.320
those created gigantic
returns for the society.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:06.710
So I understand
your point, Martin,

01:20:06.710 --> 01:20:09.680
which is that just
getting a college degree

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:14.130
doesn't necessarily fit you
for the life worth living.

01:20:14.130 --> 01:20:15.780
I think we will
all agree on that.

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:17.680
But it sure helps.

01:20:17.680 --> 01:20:18.847
It sure moves you a step up.

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:20.305
AUDIENCE: Better
than [INAUDIBLE]..

01:20:20.305 --> 01:20:22.703
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: And
gets you closer in range.

01:20:22.703 --> 01:20:24.870
Sanam, how about a closing
thought from you on this,

01:20:24.870 --> 01:20:26.187
and we'll take a short break.

01:20:26.187 --> 01:20:28.520
AUDIENCE: I think it's a lot
of good points, definitely.

01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:31.730
And I think that when
we're thinking about policy

01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:34.190
and how to move
forward, the discussion

01:20:34.190 --> 01:20:38.150
about systems of
privilege and exclusion

01:20:38.150 --> 01:20:39.510
are really important as well.

01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:41.510
And also to think about
kind of like what can we

01:20:41.510 --> 01:20:44.434
define as success both
individually and as a system

01:20:44.434 --> 01:20:48.760
is also an interesting
and problematic thing

01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:51.580
that we should
continue to talk about.

WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
OK, so I'd like to go now to the
next segment of the course.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Think you can probably appreciate
little bit better this triangle I

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:17.000
had on before about how what
biochemists did was they tended to

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
break cells open,
look at the component parts,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000
through other things in there,
and then proteins.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But an awful lot of stuff having to
do with function is proteins,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and what geneticists, the discipline
of genetics would do,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
which made mutants of living
organisms, and that looked at how

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
function was affected by mutating
individual genes,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
how those were both very powerful
approaches.  Genetics told you what

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
was really important,
and biochemistry told you how it

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
worked at a molecular level,
but the real problem is knowing

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
whether this thing you had doing
something in the test tube was

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000
actually the one that
did it in life.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And I think it'll do when Arthur
Kornberg isolated the very first DNA

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
polymerase, he was able to copy DNA.
And he got a Nobel prize, and it

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
was the first enzyme that could copy
DNA, and then John Karens made a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
mutant that was lacking the enzyme.
And the organism was still alive.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So therefore, it couldn't have been
the DNA polymerase that was copying

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the chromosome.
It actually turned out to be a DNA

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
repair enzyme.
So, if you can actually unite

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
genetics and biochemistry,
if you can take a mutant that's

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
broken in a function and you found
your protein was missing,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
or vice versa, then you had a very,
very powerful insight because you

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
connect your knowledge of what was
physiologically important to the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
biochemistry that you're doing.
But it was really, really hard for

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
years, and only in very rare
occasions did some geneticists have

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
a mutant that suggests so strongly
that some biochemists would look,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
or some biochemists would have such
a powerful result that they talked

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000
to a geneticist and seen if anybody
had found the result.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And the power of recombinant DNA,
although it started a biotech

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
industry, and it made possible the
sequencing of the genome,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
there's another level up one higher
in conceptual understanding.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And what it did was, it let you go
back and forth between here and here.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You wouldn't have any problem now
if I gave you the sequencing of the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
gene, you can order it.
You could stick it in a cell and

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
make massive amounts of the protein.
You purified it twenty-fold and it

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
would be pure,
whereas before you might have had to

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
purified it fifteen thousand-fold
out of 1,000 g of cells,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
and you would have had to been a
very good biochemists with 15 steps

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
in order to purify it.
So, you can go from the sequence of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
the gene to the protein,
or if we got a protein and we wanted

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
to know which gene we'd just
sequence a bit of the protein,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
use that genetic code, work
ourselves backwards to some possible

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000
sequences, then go looking for the
sequences, and then go

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
find the gene.
So, what recombinant DNA allows us

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
to do is close that loop.
You can go from genetics to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
biochemistry at back and forth.
Now everybody does everything

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
instead of it being isolated
disciplines, which it was when I

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
entered the field.
So, all of the stuff depended on

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
the development to clone particular
pieces of DNA.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And I want to make clear right at
the beginning,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
there's a couple of uses of cloning
that are in popular

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
usage right now.
What we're talking about in this

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
lecture is cloning a piece of DNA.
What that means, is I'm going to

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
take a particular segment of DNA,
say, cut it here, and cut it there.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And I'm going to take that piece,
and I'm going to do something to it

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that lets me amplify it and make
many, many copies of that piece of

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
DNA.  And cloning of anything else
you make a whole lot of copies.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
So that's one use of the word
cloning.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The other use,
which you see in the popular press

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000
all the time, is cloning an
individual, but not being there but

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
you would take the nucleus from the
cell of the individual,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
he put that nucleus into an egg that
didn't have its own nucleus moved,

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
and now you hope what you get out of
that is an organism that has all the

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
same genetic content as the
starting individual.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
And in fact, although it sounds very
good in paper,

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
is you're probably beginning to see
it's not the panacea that people

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
thought it was,
or that we'd have to worry that in

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
10 years, all of my MIT students
would be clones of the brightest

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
person in the class or anything like
that, because other stuff happens,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000
because unless you go on to advanced
biology courses,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
but there are modifications of DNA.
There's all sorts of stuff that

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
happens to it, so it's
not identical.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
And so many of these cloned
organisms, like Dolly the sheep,

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
that was famous, died early with,
I forget, arthritis and things.  So,

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000
there are a lot of problems on that
score.  But that's the other use of

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
the word cloning and that's not what
these next three lectures that we

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
are talking about cloning a piece of
DNA.  And that was the big problem

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
that faced the field,
certainly when I was an undergrad

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
and even when I was a grad student I
was interested in synthesizing

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
pieces of DNA,
and it was one of those things that

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
people said, why are you doing it?
Well, because you could try to do

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
it.  What if you got a piece of DNA,
like Gobind Khorana, who's my

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
colleague, who got the Nobel prize
for synthesizing the first gene.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
He synthesized it.
It was a tRNA gene that was 120

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
nucleotide base pairs long or
something.  He synthesized it.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
He'd shown you could do it.  But
you couldn't do anything with it.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
And there were sort of two big
problems.  One was the fact that

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:04.000
this DNA, although it's not its a
monotonous tetranucleotide.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
It's pretty hard to tell.
Each one of these things is a base

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
pair, and human DNA has 3 billion of
those.  And a bit down here,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
doesn't look very different than the
bit out there.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And it certainly wouldn't looks
very different than the bit of DNA

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000
that's 2 billion base pairs over on
the other side of campus or

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000
something.  So,
there is no way to take DNA and cut

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000
it reproducibly, so you
to get fragments.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
What you could see from first
principles was what you would need

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000
was magic scissors.
And what would the scissors look

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
like?  Well, it would have to be
scissors that could be sequenced

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000
because there's nothing else
different.  You know it's a regular

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000
backbone, and it's only four
nucleotides.  So,

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000
if you wanted to cut DNA in
particular places,

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:55.000
you had to have scissors that could
see a sequence.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000
And furthermore,
you can see they couldn't just,

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
there are the hydrogen bonding parts
of ANT or GNC because those are

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
stuck together there in
the middle of the DNA.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000
So, you'd need scissors that could
somehow find a sequence and make a

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
cut.  And those were found.
I'm going to till you about those.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000
They're called restriction enzymes.
So that was part of the thing.  The

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
other thing was,
imagine I could cut out this

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
fragment.  And they gave it to you,
and I said, great.  Now I've got it.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Would you make me a lot of copies
of this DNA?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Could you do that?
Let's say, you now know how to

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000
transform the principle that we saw
back with Avery.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.000
We could take naked DNA and put
this fragment into the cell.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Would it replicate?  What do you
think?  Anybody remember?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.000
No?  OK, we talked about some other
languages, right?

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
But one of the things that's in the
DNA is the genetic code with all the

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000
genes.  And we can find the reading
frame.  Remember when we talked

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000
about an origin of replication.
I said that was sort of, at least

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
for E. coli there's one origin.
In eukaryotes the origins are

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
spaced out along the DNA.
And every time you have a round of

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000
replication, it starts with one of
those origins and then goes.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000
So the chance of this piece of DNA
by chance is going to have an origin

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000
is pretty small.
So if I put it into an organism,

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000
it's going to sit there, if you're
lucky, make it degraded because it's

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000
got [blend ins?
, or even if I made it into circle

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000
it probably wouldn't replicate
because it probably doesn't have the

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000
word in the DNA that says start a
round of DNA replication.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000
So, the other overarching principle
of DNA replication is you somehow

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
have to take the fragment of DNA
that you're looking at,

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:02.000
and you have to attach it to an
origin of replication.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Now, if you have an origin of
replication and you have a fragment

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000
of DNA, and you put it in the cell,
now you'll get a lot of copies of

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
that piece of DNA.
So that's what recombinant DNA is

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000
all about in a really,
really simple form.  I'm just going

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
to take you now into increasing sort
of levels of detail.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
So, let me just sort of give you
just sort of a really broad view of

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.000
this cloning, and then we'll sort of
start to dive in to some of the

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
fancier techniques that
have come out of this.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
We'll talk about DNA sequencing,
and PCR, and stuff in the next

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000
lecture.  So the first principle
here is to cut the DNA,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
and I know you may think this is
sort of baby talk,

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000
but this is how I think.
If you really think about this

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000
stuff, this is what it really is.
With sequence specific molecular

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000
scissors, these have the
rather odd name.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000
They're called restriction enzymes.
I don't know if any of you know why

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000
they're called restriction enzymes,
and although I'm sure that some of

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
you have used them in your op to cut
up pieces of DNA.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
But what that does,
these are enzymes, as I'll tell you,

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
that recognize a particular sequence.
And they always cut at that

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000
sequence.  In the value of that is
you can reproducibly cut DNA exactly

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
the same spot,
and the spots are specified by

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000
whatever sequence that particular
pair of scissors knows how to read.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Then the next thing we have to do is
we need to join the piece of DNA to

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000
an origin of replication.
So the thing that carries the

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000
origin of replication is called a
vector.  And usually,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
not always, these are circles.
We'll consider the ones that grow

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
in E. coli are most of the time,
or in bacteria, mostly circles.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000
They are the ones that are broadly
used for most cloning.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:12.000
So, we'll talk about those.
What makes a vector?  When it has

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:19.000
to have is an origin of DNA
replication.  They usually have

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000
something else.
We could call it a selectable

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:34.000
marker, but something like
a drug resistance.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
If any of you have done cloning in a
UROP usually it's something like a

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000
gene for making the cell ampicillin
resistant, or tetracycline resistant,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000
some antibiotic that would normally
kill the cell.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
So you can tell,
does that cell have that vector or

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000
not because the cell starts at
either ampicillin sensitive.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000
It acquires the vector that's
replicating it,

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
also acquires the gene that gives it
the drug resistance.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
But if we're going to cut that,
if we're going to join a piece of

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
DNA to that, we can't join into a
circle without breaking it.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:18.000
So, we need to cut the vector at a
unique site.  And we would use a

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000
restriction enzyme for that.
And you can also see in designing a

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.000
vector, you'd want something that
only has one site.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000
So, what we would have achieved from
this conceptually as we've now got

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:41.000
this, this is the vector,
its origin of replication here,

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
and let's say ampicillin resistance,
for example, as a selectable marker,

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
the gene for that could be encoded
here.  And we have the fragment of,

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000
if you want to that down, just put
it down on the floor,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
I think.  We've made the point at
this stage.  Thanks.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000
What one has to do is to join this
piece of DNA to that.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And we'll go to the molecular
details of this.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
But, we'll join the fragment to the
vector, and actually this was

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
something that was already in
molecular biologists' toolkits,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
have been studying DNA replication.
That's DNA ligase.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
When we finish an Okazaki fragment,
we had to seal [UNINTELLIGIBLE] and

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
the enzyme that did that was an
enzyme called DNA ligase.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
So, molecular biologists basically
had the scotch tape or the glue to

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.000
join stuff back together.
What they were missing for many,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
many years where the sequence
specific molecular scissors.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
So at this stage, if we were doing
the recombinant DNA,

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000
we now have a vector.
We now have a piece of DNA joined

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000
to it.
In fact, we probably have a whole

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:09.000
other mess of things that happens
along the way.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But at the moment,
they're in a test tube.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000
So, if we want to have this thing
grow, what do we have to do next?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
We are going to have to get the DNA
from outside the cell inside the

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.000
cell.  That's the word; we need to
transform the DNA into a cell.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Again, the word transform,
that goes back to those

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000
transformation experiments with the
Streptococcus pneumonia going from

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000
smooth to rough,
and you are taking stuff from the

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
cell that transformed them from
rough to smooth,

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
whatever, that's where the word came
from, but we now know it's getting

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
naked DNA inside the cell where it
can be replicated.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
And then the next thing we need to
know is, what cells have acquired

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
this vector that at least
as the vector.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:09.000
We'll settle for that in the
beginning, and to do that,

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000
you need to select for the marker on
the vector.  In the case of this one,

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000
we would start with a strain that
killed my ampicillin,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000
and then we just play it out and ask
for guys that are ampicillin

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
resistant.
And, you can see that there is

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
another class of problem because if
we had uncut vector,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
and there would probably be,
for sure, some of that in our mix,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
that would make the cells ampicillin.
And if we had an insert,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
it would also be ampicillin.
So, if we really wanted to get into

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
this, we'd have to do some more work
to sort out what's on there.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.000
But that's the basic stuff.  I
suspect most of you know this

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
practically since kindergarten.
But that's the overall framework

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
into which, now,
I'm going to start layering

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000
different pieces of detail.
And the next part,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
again, some of you may know.
I don't think it will be a totally

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
foreign concept.
You are probably familiar with this,

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
that what are these restriction
enzymes?  The actual word is

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.000
restriction endonuclease.
They are often usually called

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000
restriction enzymes in a lab
[parlons?].  Nuclease is something

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
that cuts the nucleic acid,
and endonuclease is one that doesn't

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
need a free end.
So, it can cut in the middle of the

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000
sequence instead of nibbling at the
end.  That would be

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
an exonuclease.
So, these things have names that

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000
tend to be something like ECO-R1,
which has something to do with where

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:50.000
they are derived from.
And a typical one, one of the very

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
first ones that is still in really
wide use, is ECO-R1.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And this recognizes the sequence G
A A T T C.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Now, you'll notice that if you read
the sequence in this way it's the

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000
same sequence when you read it on
the other strand.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000
It's called a palindrome but be
careful because palindromes in

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000
English, those are words that you
read from the front to the back;

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:23.000
they're the same.
In an English letter,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000
it doesn't matter whether it's in A
here or an A there.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
But you guys know something about
DNA structure.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000
There's a five to three prime
polarity.  So,

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000
reading this way doesn't look at all
the same.  It's totally different.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000
But reading in this strand, we say
that's five to three.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000
The thing that's identical is the
reciprocal sequence on the other

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
side.  So there is this,
you see G A A and G A A but it's not

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000
like the English word palindrome,
so get yourself mixed up about that.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Anyway, what this will then,
what this enzyme then does, is it

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
cuts to the side here.
It cuts symmetrically.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
And what it generates them is a G
three prime hydroxyl.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Remember the ribose?  If we have,
say, an A there, this is the three

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000
prime position,
and that's the five prime position

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000
in the sugar.  So,
it leaves a three prime hydroxyl,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000
and is also then leaves a five prime
phosphate.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:45.000
So, we'd have A A T T C here,
and then on the other side, we would

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:54.000
get the reciprocal thing.
So, we'd have G with a three prime

00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:03.000
hydroxyl, and then over
A A T T C like that.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000
So now we've got a break here.
We can pull those apart.  But one

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000
of the nice things you can see right
from this is that we're generating

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:17.000
five prime single stranded ends,
and this one is the sequence A A T T

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:22.000
C.  This is A A T T C here,
and these guys, if they could get

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000
together and line up as they would
here, they'd be able to

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
form hydrogen bonds.
So, if you take an enzyme like

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
ECO-R1,  and we took,
let's say, a circle that had a

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
single ECO-R1 site,
G A A T T C, if we cut it with the

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000
restriction enzyme we would make
[nicks?].  And if we kept a cold,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000
all that we'd have is DNA nicks.
And if we warm things up a little

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
bit, there's only four hydrogen
bonds that are holding that together.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So, the thing would linearize and
just flop around in the breeze.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
If we cooled it slowly, the
thermodynamically most favorable

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
state, the lowest energy state,
would be with those ends coming back

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
together.  So,
we could then add DNA ligase.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
If we added these up and added DNA
ligase, we could reverse the process

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000
and go back and forth,
ECO-R1 to cut it, DNA to ligate it.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And then, the beauty of recombinant
DNA is this rejoining part doesn't

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:30.000
see what's out here or
what's out there.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:34.000
All it sees is the little ends that
are generated by an ECO-R1 site.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
So they take some of my DNA, and
I'll cut it up.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000
I'll get a zillion ECO-R1 fragments,
but they'll all have the same little

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000
overhanging bit that's complementary
to the vector.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
So if I take a vector cut with
ECO-R1, and I take some of my own

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
DNA and I mix them,
I can get a little fragment,

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
get in between the vector, and it
does exactly that joining that I was

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
diagramming right here.
So again, it was the discovery of

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:10.000
these restriction enzymes that made
possible almost all the stuff that's

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
happened in biology since 1975.
The development of restriction

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
enzymes was essentially,
I was a postdoc at Berkeley at that

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000
point and the labs,
Stan Cohen at Stanford,

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Herb Boyer at UCSF, and a two others
around the country were

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000
working on this.
They were almost all labs that had

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:41.000
worked on bacterial plasmids.
Plasmids are little circles of DNA,

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000
so the labs that started were ones
who have been busy studying little

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000
circles of DNA that usually carry
drug-resistances between cells.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000
And so that was happening while I
was a postdoc.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
And when I got to MIT and '76 the
technology was just beginning.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
I was one of the first labs trying
to cut pieces of DNA and join

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000
them back together.
So, it's a pretty recent development.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.000
At that point,
DNA sequencing hadn't been invented.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000
The idea that you could pull out a
piece of DNA and do something with

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:16.000
it or produce a protein was just a
thought.  It didn't exist.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
So it's hard to overemphasize how
critical the discovery of these

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000
restriction enzymes were.
Now, I just want to tell you where

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000
they came from,
or how people found them.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
And they'll try and do this quickly
because I know some of you get

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000
impatient with history.
But this is really important because

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000
it's very easy to make fun of basic
research.  You can ridicule anything

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
pretty easily,
and you might just ask because I'm

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
telling you the story.
Somebody proposed doing this.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
I'm going to tell you the
experiment that basically is the

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
basis of the biotech industry,
and would you have been smart enough

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000
to recognize that it was the
discovery of a phenomenon called

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
restriction, restriction in
bacteriophage growth on bacteria?

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
And it was, here are actually a
couple of EM's and these little

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
plasmids.  This is an electron
micrograph one.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
In these little circles it's been
shadowed.  And this is actually

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
artificially colored,
but that was the kind of plasmids

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
that people were cutting up.
So, as I said, trying to get

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
through this DNA,
and the stuff, what's made possible

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
the sequencing at the Whitehead
Genome Center and stuff that I'll

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
tell you about is going on.
I didn't really set this one up.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000
But that's Eric Lander who teaches
701 in the fall.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I told you a picture from that DNA
50th.  Well, they had a banquet at

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:44.000
the end of it,
and I was there.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000
This is [Savandi Pabo?
from Europe who is sequencing the

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.000
chimp genome.  And that's Francis
Collins who is head of the entire

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Human Genome Project.
This is Evelyn Witkin,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
who was a big discoverer of early
DNA repair events.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
And I put that one in because it
was sort of interesting.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
There was Eric,
and Savandi, and Francis were

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
talking about what would happen when
they knew the sequence of the chimp

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
genome, which wasn't done.
And there was an advertisement,

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000
a poster advertising Jim Watson's
latest book.  And they ripped that

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
in half, and were writing notes on
the back all the way through dinner.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
So if you want to see what
scientists on the cutting edge,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
including someone who teaches 701
the fall looks like when they are

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
not teaching 701,
there is a picture.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
So anyway, the discovery of
restriction enzymes was Salvador

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Luria, who I've mentioned.
He was a member of the biology

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
department, and one of our Nobel
Prize winners.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000
He started the cancer center.
He also trained at Jim Watson,

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
when I showed you that picture.
This is Salvador standing over here.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Another thing that Salvador did, he
was a Nobel Prize winner but he

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
thought introductory biology.
So I am basically following in the

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
footsteps of Salvador.
He wrote a book called,

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000
even though he was a Nobel Prize
winner, a book called 36 lectures in

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:06.000
introductory biology.
And some universities,

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000
the intro to biology is taught by
whoever is at the bottom of the food

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
chain.  The most junior professor
gets stuck with intro to biology.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
And here it's the other way.  I
mean you're getting Eric and Bob,

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000
for example, Weinberg to teach in
the fall, tells you that.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000
And really where that comes from is
the fact that Salvador Luria had

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.000
such an interest in replication.
So he trained at Jim Watson,

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
started the cancer center here,
and he also carried out this

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000
phenomenon of restriction.
And to get this working with

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
bacteriophage.
And I know a [couple he wrote?

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000
, he didn't like to see old guys on
porches.  So I got freaked out,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000
and I took this next picture out for
this morning.  Oh,

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:51.000
I've got to show it anyway for two
reasons.  This is Salvador sitting

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.000
on a porch at Cold Spring Harbor
with Max Delbrook who started,

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
really, much of the work on
bacteriophage that gave us the

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
underpinnings of microbiology.
And then put it partly on A because

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
it shows the informality of the
molecular biology culture which

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:08.000
persists to this day,
and also because Salvador had such

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
an impish sense of humor.
You would have really enjoyed had

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
he been teaching this course.
Anyway, Salvador was studying this

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.000
bacteriophage.
Remember we talked about it?

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000
And they basically [with syringe?
they injected their DNA into the

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
cell.  There's an electron
micrograph.  The DNA is up top there.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
It goes in, and then the DNA takes
over the cell,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
reprograms it, and makes babyphage.
And I showed you how we make plaques.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:38.000
So that was what Salvador was
studying.  And it's a little like

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.000
what we are talking about with
Mendel.  He didn't have very many

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
techniques available to him at the
time.  He couldn't sequence DNA.

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:55.000
He couldn't do a lot of things.
But he could [plate phage?

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.000
and count, and things like that.
And what Salvador was looking at,

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000
he had a bacteriophage, and he had
two strains of bacteria.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I'll call them A and B.
OK, here comes the experiment that

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:20.000
founded the biotech industry.
You ready?  You going to fund me?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:27.000
All right, so what I propose doing
is I'm going to grow the phage on

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:34.000
strain A, and  now I'm going to
plate on strain A and strain B.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:38.000
I laid awake all last week thinking
of this experiment.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:43.000
So what did I get?  I got a lot of
plaques on strain A,

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000
probably something like 109 or 1010
per mil because that's what this

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
phage lysate usually looks like once
you've grown them up.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:57.000
And if I plate them over on strain
B, no phage, maybe an

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
occasional phage.
So, I bristly the bacteriophage can

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:08.000
grow mine on strain A.
It can't grow on strain B most of

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
the time, but some variant has
managed to figure out how to grow on

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
strain B.  Give our foray into
genetics, I think many of you would

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:24.000
think, probably as I suspect
Salvador did at the time,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
the things mutated.  It's learned.
It's made some change in its

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
genomes that's allowed it to grow on
strain B.  So,

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:40.000
I wonder if it learned to grow on
strain B, couldn't

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000
grow on strain A?
So, basically what he took was the

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:57.000
phage from that experiment,
and then he plated them on strain A

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:04.000
and strain B.
And, well, as you might guess,

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:10.000
since it was growing on strain B,
lots of plaques, and there were lots

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.000
of plaques over here.
OK, so it didn't forget how to grow

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
on strain A.  So,
better check over here,

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000
too, need a control experiment,
so take this guy, plate it out,

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
strain A, strain B,
some plaques over here.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:37.000
That's not a surprise going in
strain A.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
We are back to where we started from.
It doesn't sound like a mutant,

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.000
does it?  And if it was a mutant,
everybody should have been the same.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Instead, when you grew a phage on
strain A, it didn't have the ability

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000
to grow on strain B.
But if you gave it a chance to grow

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:04.000
on strain B, most of them
wouldn't make it.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
But if it ever did,
it had now acquired the ability to

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:15.000
grow on strain B.
So it could still grow on both.

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:21.000
But if you take somebody who had
been growing, something had been

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:27.000
growing at strain A,
it lost it.  And so, the idea there

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
was then that it wasn't a mutation.
Something was happening in the

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
strain B that enabled it
to grow on strain B.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000
And if it ever got away from that
environment, [it?

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:48.000
lost it.  So, the phenomenon was
called restriction.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:53.000
It wasn't a mutation.
It was something else.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
And it turned out, then,
that restriction was due to an

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000
enzyme.
An example of this kind of thing,

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:11.000
then, would be this ECO-R1 activity
that's able to cut at a very

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.000
specific sequence.
Now, if you are going to have a set

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:25.000
of molecular scissors inside of you
that could cut a G A T C sequences,

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:32.000
you'd have a problem unless you did
something else because every one of

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:39.000
your G A T C sequences would be cut
by the restriction enzymes.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.000
So what the cells that have a
restriction enzyme have,

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:54.000
as a modification enzyme that
recognizes the same sequence,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:32:02.000
and then modifies it in some way
that makes it resistant to the

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:09.000
restriction enzyme.
And in the case of the ECO-R1,

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.000
it puts on a methyl group on this A.
You might have thought that that

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.000
would interfere with base pairing,
but it doesn't because adenine looks

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000
like this.  These are the guys that
do the base pair refining,

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:35.000
if you look back, and you'll see
that you could put a methyl

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.000
group in there.
It wouldn't interfere with the base

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
pairing, but would allow this to go.
So, it was the discovery of this

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
phenomenon of restriction of
bacteriophage grew on one strain,

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
not on another.  It could learn to
grow on the other strain.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
It could lose that acquisition.
It was that phenomenon.  People,

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
didn't have any other reason other
than it was an interesting problem

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
in biology to understand it.
Once they understood the basis of it,

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
another whole world opened up
because you could see from basic

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
principles, now I could cut any
piece of DNA.  I could generate

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
these little overhanging sticky ends.
I could take a plasmid.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
People knew about those.
I could find one that only has one

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
restriction site.
I could stick things in.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Now I've attached an origin of
replication to each of those pieces.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000
And I'm in business.
I can now, for the first time ever,

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:38.000
take a particular piece of DNA and
make as many copies as I want.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.000
And that was an absolute
transformation to the way people

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000
were able to think about biology.
So I'm going to just kind of give

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:56.000
you an idea of how people would
start.  So the way people began and

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:02.000
still began most things is they'd
call it, the usual term is you call

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000
constructing a recombinant
DNA library.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:17.000
And there are a variety of different
ways of doing this.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:26.000
But this principle is the same.
We'd take the DNA from whatever

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:36.000
organism you're interested
in, [and studying?].

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:43.000
And we cut with some restriction
enzyme.  And this restriction enzyme

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:51.000
will cut wherever there happened to
be sites.  They might be close

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:59.000
together.  They might be far apart.
But whatever, still generate some

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:05.000
characteristic set of fragments.
And we'll now have,

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
in this case, fragment number one,
fragment number two, fragment number

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
three, fragment number four,
and so on.  And if it's my DNA,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:18.000
there's a lot of fragments.  And of
course, they're all mixed up.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
I can't tell where any of them are.
They're just all mixed together in

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
the test tube.
Then we'll take that vector that

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000
we've opened.
And now, we'll mix all of these

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:37.000
fragments together with this vector.
And then we join it just the way

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:43.000
[that it's cut?
.  And now what we'll get,

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:49.000
it's a collection of plasmids that
have different inserts.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.000
So, one of the plasmids will have
that fragment number one.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Another one of them will have
fragment number two, number

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:06.000
three, and so on.
Then this whole thing is what's

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:11.000
known as a library.
You can see if it's DNA from me,

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
there were 3 billion base pairs to
start.  Given the human DNA,

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
G A T C sequences are pretty common.
You can calculate the frequency

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:27.000
yourself for how many sites on
average there would be for a

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000
restriction enzyme within a piece of
DNA and figure out roughly how the

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.000
fragments there would be in the
library of human DNA.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
So, we are partway there.
We can now make a library.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000
We can make it from bacterial DNA.
We can make it from human DNA.  But

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:51.000
the next thing that people had to
learn how to do was to figure out

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.000
how to find a particular fragment
that had the gene that you

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
are interested in.
And there's a whole variety of

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
things.  I mean,
ultimately today since the human

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
genome is sequenced,
you go on a computer and a type and

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
you find it because the sequence is
all known.  But the only reason we

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
can do that is because of all the
work that was done in between.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
So, I'll give you several ways of
doing this.  But one of the ways I

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
think you can see very easily,
and it's actually going back to the

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
term complementation.
Remember complementation?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
We had something that was mutant,
and then we'd put in a wild type

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
gene, and fixed it up again.
So, for example,

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000
suppose I was studying histidine
biosynthesis in E.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000
coli, and I wanted to find the gene
that encoded the enzyme that I had

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000
just disabled in my histidine minus
mutant.  So, if I have a

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
[hisoxotroph?],
I'll call it a [his G?

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000
gene, for example, that's one of
the genes involved in making

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
histidine.  So,
since it's a histidine auxotroph,

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
if I have it on just minimal glucose
plates, and I streak it out,

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:07.000
it's not going to grow.
But if I grow it on minimal glucose

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:13.000
plus histidine,
then it will be able to grow,

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000
right?  So, I've got a variant of
this organism.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000
It's got a single mutation in it
that's affecting one gene.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
And because I don't have that gene,
I can't grow on minimal.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
If I made a library of E.
coli DNA, which is going to have a

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
lot of fragments as well,
and I took that library and I put it

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
into this mutant,
I'm going to get a big mess of

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000
things, all the different plasmids
with all the different fragments

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000
that go into that mutant.
How am I going to find the one that

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
I want?  Anybody see that?
It's not that hard.  I'm the mutant.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.000
I can't grow on minimal because I
can't make this enzyme.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Therefore, I can't make histidine.
What do I need?  How could you fix

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:14.000
me up if you were a doctor?
What's the gene we want out of here?

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:20.000
The one that makes that particular
enzyme that makes histidine.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Yeah, take the whole library,
stick it in this mutant.  If the

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:31.000
gene coming in encodes DNA
polymerase, I'm not going

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
to help this guy.
It still won't grow in minimal,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:42.000
take a gene involved in making part
of the cell wall would help.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.000
But if I put in the, I get a
fragment of DNA that includes the

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:53.000
his G plus gene,
and I put it in here,

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000
it's going to grow up.
If it has the plasmid that has,

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
or let's say the vector that has the
his G plus gene.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
So what you've done is a really,
sort of, you've used that principle

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:12.000
of complementation that some of you
were sort of wondering about when we

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
were doing genetics.
So, you'd break a copy of a gene.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
In the things we talked about, we
bring in a whole chromosome that

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
included in it just a wild type copy
of the gene.  With recombinant DNA,

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000
we can really narrow it down in the
extreme.  We can bring in a piece of

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
DNA that is only the gene
that's broken.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.000
And we can take the gene back to the
wild type.  One thing,

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000
just to close, you'll see,
if you remember back when I talked

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
about language that are not
universal, although the genetic code

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:50.000
is universal, promoters and things
are not.  So I couldn't ever do this

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000
with a human DNA,
could I, because it wouldn't get

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:59.000
expressed.  So,
we need some other ways of finding

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000
those.  We'll talk about those on
the next lecture, OK?

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.060
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: OK.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.960
Social movements remind
you of the picture

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.600
we had the first day,
and once or twice--

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.860
I should have done
it more often since--

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.820
but on the first day we've been
talking about policy making.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.690
We did on Monday.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.310
We talked mainly
about interest groups

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.460
here, a little bit about
regulatory processes.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.430
We'll come back to
that on Wednesday.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:57.100
But up here at the top is
this vague outside the box--

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.600
outside these boxes, at least,
category of norms and customs

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.700
and values and traditions
and institutions

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.910
that we had movements in
their, social movements.

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.140
And that's what we're
going to talk about today.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.520
We're going to talk about
what they are, how they differ

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.840
from other policy
actors, how they work,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.800
and briefly, what impacts can we
see on energy and environmental

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.700
policy.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.910
So if you think about
who effects policy,

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.420
there are obviously individual
firms or households.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.560
And in the US setting
you have to think about

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.562
for federal policy.

00:01:36.562 --> 00:01:38.770
You have to think about some
federal governments that

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.530
occasionally tribes.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.090
What we talked
about last time were

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.210
all of these, this alphabet
soup of interest groups

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.640
that you will find on
K Street in Washington,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.400
and you'll find various
analogs in state capitals.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.500
Sometimes they fly in.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.380
For those who don't live
in this world, that's

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.410
the National Rifle Association,
the American Forrest Products

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.730
Association, the Environmental
Defense Fund, the AFL/CIO,

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.670
the Union Organization,
the American Association

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.419
of Retired People, which sends
you mailings when you turn 50

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:12.370
to show you're really old.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.920
The American Petroleum
Institute, the National Coal

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.600
Institute, and
there are many more.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.140
Then there are
political parties.

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.540
Republican, Democrat,
or Democratic,

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.480
depending on which parity
you affiliate with.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.140
Green parties in lots of places,
Whig parties in US history,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.020
plenty of other parties
in various places.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.840
And then social movements.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.410
So the best way I find to
think about a social movement

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.010
is to think about examples.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.322
So as I go back to my
period of consciousness,

00:02:48.322 --> 00:02:50.530
there are a number of them
that come to mind, and let

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.930
me just walk through a few.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.120
There is the Civil
Rights Movement.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.050
That's the group gathering to
hear Dr. Martin Luther King.

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.530
Not all those people were
paying dues to anything

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.260
or had membership
cards to anything,

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.410
but they had all
come to Washington.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.810
Most people would probably
call the Civil Rights

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.510
Movement successful, maybe not.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.990
This is the Anti-Vietnam
War Movement.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.330
That, of course, is at MIT.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.890
This was in 1970.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.930
The picture-- and that's
some other campus,

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.730
and this is Washington.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.300
The picture I looked for
very hard but couldn't find,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.430
and I know it
exists, is a picture

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.100
of the then President
of MIT, Howard Johnson,

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.040
marching with a
group of students

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.270
down Mass Avenue with
an anti-war banner.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.260
That movement, you might
call successful ultimately.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.120
But I'm going to
come back to this.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.870
You might ask, why?

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.030
Most of those people were
too young to vote, so why was

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.755
that movement successful?

00:04:02.755 --> 00:04:04.380
Or did the movement
have anything to do

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.630
with ending the war, actually?

00:04:08.082 --> 00:04:09.540
This is the
environmental movement.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.890
That's an early rally.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.170
Senator Muskie in Washington--

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.540
I think that's in Washington,
addressing a group.

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.390
And the tree hugger on the
right, I couldn't resist.

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.100
So there you've got the
environmental movement.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.150
Successful?

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:25.710
Maybe, maybe not.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.960
Also, you'll notice one
of the interest groups

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.080
I had up there was the
Environmental Defense Fund.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.930
So one might want to think
about where that boundary is,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.960
and we'll come back to that.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.450
The Women's Movement.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.520
You see there, the--

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.790
I think that's the entirety
of the Equal Rights

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:51.120
Amendment, for which
there was also opposition.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.750
As regards the Equal
Rights Amendment,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.880
you could argue that
was pretty successful.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.510
Those-- you don't see
votes like that anymore.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.760
The Equal Rights Amendment
phrased on the left

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:10.050
passed the House in 1972 354
to 24, in the Senate, 84 to 8.

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.400
That means there were a lot
of Republican votes for it.

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:22.800
30 states ratified it by the
end of 1973, but it failed.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.020
They needed 38 to pass.

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:27.630
It got 35 by 1979.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.130
Never got to 30--

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.075
all of these pieces of--

00:05:31.075 --> 00:05:33.450
all of these amendments have
a deadline for ratification.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.350
The deadline here was
'79, and it didn't make it

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.380
and some states
rescinded ratification.

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.510
And I don't think
you could get that--

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.740
I don't think you could get that
Amendment voted on in Congress

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:49.020
now, let alone passed.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.130
So you've got to ask, was
that movement successful?

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.060
That was a movement.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:56.920
I mean, you got
troops turning out.

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:58.210
You got rallies.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.530
You got an anti movement.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:01.450
Was that movement successful?

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:03.580
What did it do?

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.010
This is a more recent one.

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:10.510
You may recall the meetings of
the World Trade Organization,

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.600
the International Organization
that basically sets trading

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.630
rules for international trade.

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.300
For a period, those
meetings were dangerous.

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.300
I don't know whether this
is the one in Seattle,

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.000
but Downtown Seattle
got sort of trashed

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.460
by people who were
protesting globalization,

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.020
protesting the WTO, which is
a bunch of bureaucrats who

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.830
deal with trade disputes
and associated it

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.110
with global injustice.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.530
1999.

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.030
That movement failed.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.030
I think that's
fair to say, right?

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.980
We have globalized.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.350
Trade has not turned
back, and that movement

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:52.060
has pretty much vanished.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.230
How come?

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.410
How come some succeed
and some fail?

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:58.240
This is the
anti-nuclear movement.

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.230
This is international.

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.720
This is-- that's Germany,
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.860
That's Japan, and
that, of course,

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.680
is Vermont, where the future
of the Vermont Yankee Nuclear

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.930
Plant is much debated.

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:16.768
Is that movement successful?

00:07:16.768 --> 00:07:18.310
That movement start--
well, I'm going

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:20.852
to come back to that movement,
because we'll talk about that,

00:07:20.852 --> 00:07:22.870
actually, at some length.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.608
But that movement is global.

00:07:26.608 --> 00:07:28.150
A lot of power plants
have been built

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.300
since that movement started,
a lot of nuclear plants still

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.170
active.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.530
This is the anti-fracking
movement, more recently.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.870
That's New York, as you see.

00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:46.330
That's somewhere in Paris, and
that, I believe, is Bulgaria.

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.480
So it, like the
anti-nuclear movement,

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.020
is fairly broad geographically.

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:55.320
Has succeeded in some places,
succeeded at least tentatively

00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.498
in New York and in France.

00:07:57.498 --> 00:07:59.415
I have no idea what the
status is in Bulgaria.

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:06.570
The Tea Party movement,
look at those numbers.

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:08.970
Has the Tea Party movement
succeeded? will the Tea Party

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:09.690
movement last?

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:13.730
How does the Tea
Party movement work?

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:17.130
And, of course, on
the other side--

00:08:17.130 --> 00:08:18.920
by the way, that's impressive.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.630
That's Washington.

00:08:20.630 --> 00:08:24.590
That's Pennsylvania
Avenue full of people.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:30.080
This is the opposite side of
the coin, the Occupy Movement.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:39.350
Again, jobs not cuts whereas
the-- we want less over here.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.799
And jobs not cuts over here.

00:08:42.799 --> 00:08:47.630
So you have two opposed
social movements as we speak.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:52.770
And then most
dramatically, this is

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:58.200
a good time for this topic, most
dramatically, the Arab Spring.

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.900
So as you go around, there's
Tahrir Square in Egypt.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.430
There's Tunisia.

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:07.860
There's Yemen.

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.540
Government toppled, government
toppled, government toppled.

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.080
Bahrain, protests continuing.

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.930
Syria, Civil War.

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:22.430
Libya, government toppled.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:26.130
Social movements.

00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.030
OK, there are a lot of them.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.850
This is just one
slice of history,

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.340
a recent slice of history.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:36.850
I'm going to come back and
talk about some of them.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:38.910
But the first thing we
ought to worry about

00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:44.400
is, what are these things?

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:48.120
How are they distinct
from other actors?

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.760
Certainly, they're trying
to influence policy.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.030
That's what they're there for.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:56.310
Not always in a
coherent way, not always

00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.230
in a well-defined way.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:05.470
The anti-globalization movement,
what exactly did they want?

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:07.203
What's the Occupy Movement want?

00:10:07.203 --> 00:10:09.370
But in any case, they're
trying to-- not necessarily

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:10.840
with a specific
agenda, but they're

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.120
trying to have some influence.

00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.340
This is easy.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.210
I listed these
actors at the start.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:21.420
They're not a formal
part of the process.

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:22.530
They're not on the ballot.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.910
They're not registered.

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:27.240
They don't have national
committees and slates

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.070
of candidates formally.

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.280
The boundary between a social
movement and an interest group,

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:37.500
though, and Burstein
talks about, this

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.030
is a little blurrier, right?

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:43.440
[? Lowey, ?] whom
we read earlier,

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.960
has this italicized phrase,
which is interesting.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:53.980
All established interest
groups are conservative.

00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.080
And he means conservative
not in the sense

00:10:56.080 --> 00:11:00.910
of left, right, in the sense
of less government, more

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.370
government, but in the
old-fashioned sense

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:06.710
of less change, more change.

00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:08.740
So he means they are
conservative in the sense

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.420
that interest groups tend
to resist radical change.

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:13.450
They're part of the system.

00:11:13.450 --> 00:11:16.780
The American Forrest
Products Association

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.600
has some laws it likes, has
some laws it doesn't like,

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.610
lobbies here, lobbies there.

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:25.180
If you said, let's fundamentally
rethink the way we do timber,

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.575
they'd be appalled
because that's not

00:11:28.575 --> 00:11:31.940
what they're there for.

00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:32.440
OK.

00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:38.560
So that's-- and they also tend
to be more structured, right?

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.620
The Environmental Defense Fund
has members, has a budget,

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:45.160
has offices, has
lobbyists, writes papers.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:48.070
They do routine influence.

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:49.210
They lobby.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.520
They enter briefs in court.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.180
They send in petitions.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:58.690
Social movements tend
to be on the margins,

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:00.700
tend to be on the
margins of the system.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.680
Membership is not well defined.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.800
Who was a member of the
Civil Rights Movement?

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.870
Who was a member of
the anti-war movement,

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:09.790
anti-Vietnam movement?

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:11.620
Almost everybody I
knew did something.

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.410
None of us had cards.

00:12:14.410 --> 00:12:17.650
And they tend to engage in what
you'd call non-routine actions,

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:20.350
like marches and demonstrations
and chaining themselves

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.040
to fences and all of that stuff.

00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.860
They vary, resources,
organization, tactics.

00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:28.930
Greenpeace is an
interesting example, right?

00:12:28.930 --> 00:12:33.880
Greenpeace is noted for its
anti-whaling activities,

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.900
has ships, intercepts,
interferes with whaling.

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.240
That's a non-routine action.

00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.810
It also has lobbyists
in various capitals

00:12:44.810 --> 00:12:46.700
to push for various things.

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:51.020
So Greenpeace is
an interest group

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.000
in the sense of being
organized and having

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
members and dues and
stuff, but it also

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.930
engages in non-standard tactics.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:08.780
But all of the examples
social movements I had

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:14.590
tend to be without a
defined membership.

00:13:14.590 --> 00:13:16.540
Who was part of the Arab Spring?

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.800
Varied from day to day.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.010
Who showed up for
the demonstrations?

00:13:21.010 --> 00:13:23.800
Who's part of the anti-Putin
movement, to the extent

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.750
it is a movement, in Russia?

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.180
Who comes?

00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:29.830
Who was part of the
anti-war movement?

00:13:29.830 --> 00:13:31.580
Who was part of the
Civil Rights Movement?

00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.250
So the membership
tends to be unclear.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:37.090
The actions tend
to be non-standard.

00:13:37.090 --> 00:13:39.160
The anti-Vietnam
movement did engage

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.530
in massive letter
writing campaigns,

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.180
which is pretty standard.

00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.110
But it also occupied the
MIT president's office

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:49.450
and various other University
presidents offices,

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.970
which is pretty non-standard.

00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:54.850
So it's a mixture.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:58.650
Thoughts about this so far?

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.230
OK.

00:14:01.230 --> 00:14:04.330
So how do they work
when they work?

00:14:04.330 --> 00:14:08.290
How might any of these
affect public policy?

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:09.670
What are the mechanisms?

00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:11.620
Why do they matter?

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.160
What do they ever matter?

00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.660
What are they doing?

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:19.033
Yeah?

00:14:19.033 --> 00:14:20.700
AUDIENCE: Sometimes,
it's trying to show

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.530
that if a politician
does something

00:14:22.530 --> 00:14:24.720
that these social
movements-- or back

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.320
something these social
movements find distasteful,

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:33.256
unpopular, [INAUDIBLE]
less likely to get elected.

00:14:33.256 --> 00:14:37.298
[INAUDIBLE] an example might
be that [INAUDIBLE] People

00:14:37.298 --> 00:14:39.960
made it very clear that
this was not something

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.900
they supported, and so
politicians backed away

00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:42.890
from it.

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:46.490
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: So one
mechanism is in a sense,

00:14:46.490 --> 00:14:54.740
they provide information or
they demonstrate salience.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.520
Salience is awareness.

00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.073
So an issue's salient
to me if I'm aware of it

00:15:13.073 --> 00:15:14.240
and I consider it important.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:17.750
So you could argue that the
anti-Vietnam protests made

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.950
it clear that, to at least
a segment of the population,

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:25.040
all of us who could get
drafted, we were very

00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.880
aware of what was going on.

00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:29.160
It was very important to us.

00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.950
We felt strongly.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.820
OK, so they can provide
information about salience,

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.070
about the population's feelings.

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:40.980
How else might it work?

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.690
Yeah, Brendan?

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:42.960
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
You could just--

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.627
not necessarily
motivate the politician.

00:15:44.627 --> 00:15:48.222
You also motivate other
people to come on board.

00:15:48.222 --> 00:15:49.680
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So you might--

00:15:54.490 --> 00:15:59.590
well, there are two ways
you might do that, right?

00:15:59.590 --> 00:16:02.020
One way is to
change preferences.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.790
You could persuade people that--

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:17.540
by getting them to think about
it, that this group is right.

00:16:17.540 --> 00:16:20.300
You could argue that was a
large part of what Martin Luther

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.050
King did, and the effective
leadership of the Civil Rights

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:25.550
Movement.

00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:28.700
It persuaded a lot of people
that the current state

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:33.530
of affairs was just
wrong, full stop, wrong.

00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:36.800
It blurs with raise salience.

00:16:43.990 --> 00:16:46.000
I think these two
are hard to separate,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.670
because it could be that
an awful lot of people

00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:51.310
in the North were
unaware of just how

00:16:51.310 --> 00:16:53.830
segregated the South was.

00:16:53.830 --> 00:16:58.600
So you made people aware of
it by increasing awareness.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:00.890
That works, of course,
if they agree with you.

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:01.712
Charlotte?

00:17:01.712 --> 00:17:03.580
AUDIENCE: I also think
that, going along

00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.560
with the trend of getting
more people involved,

00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.010
just having a group makes people
who already have that belief,

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.260
maybe are already aware of
the issue, but just unaware

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:13.329
of how they could affect
it, join together.

00:17:13.329 --> 00:17:17.235
And then it [INAUDIBLE] just
because there are more bodies.

00:17:17.235 --> 00:17:18.610
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So this is--

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:21.730
AUDIENCE: Like attract
people, I guess [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.780
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: The-- yeah.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.280
Yeah.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.510
The model Burstein
has is that works

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:31.810
if it makes a politician
rethink, rethink

00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:34.100
their prospects.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:38.020
And so I guess I'd sort of
put that one in a way here.

00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.530
But you'd say it not only
demonstrates to politicians

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.720
that a lot of people
care about, it

00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.460
demonstrates to a
lot of other people

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:46.700
that people care about it.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:50.170
And that's a lot of the story
of the Arab Spring, I think,

00:17:50.170 --> 00:17:52.840
is you've got a few
people who are just

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:57.550
sufficiently outraged that they
would risk getting shot at.

00:17:57.550 --> 00:17:59.900
And other people said,
well, I feel that way, too,

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:03.500
and if they're going to do
that, maybe I should do that.

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:06.760
And at some point you
demonstrate to the regime

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.880
that it lacks popular support.

00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:13.360
And regimes that
aren't Democratic

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.270
tend to not have much idea
how much support they have,

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:19.115
and it's easy to exaggerate
how much support you have.

00:18:19.115 --> 00:18:20.740
Because every time
you go out in public

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:22.930
and have a parade, people cheer.

00:18:22.930 --> 00:18:25.630
Because they-- why
wouldn't you cheer?

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.143
The dictator's going by.

00:18:27.143 --> 00:18:28.060
So that's interesting.

00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:31.750
You can say it sort
of rallies people,

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:37.660
and I think those are the most
plausible ways we've got them.

00:18:37.660 --> 00:18:42.970
The others-- Burstein
looks at people

00:18:42.970 --> 00:18:49.540
who argue that these
somehow persuade, as

00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.430
in a logical sense.

00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.650
But that's not
plausible, he says,

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:58.752
and I agree with
him, that they're not

00:18:58.752 --> 00:19:00.460
going to-- you don't
march in the streets

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.400
to make an
intellectual argument.

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:06.640
You march in the streets
to do something else.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.890
And if it isn't going to
affect re-election, why bother?

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:16.030
And if it is, why is
the group necessary

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:17.620
if the person knows it?

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:24.420
You could argue that the
anti-Vietnam demonstrations

00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:29.970
simply made it inescapable that
there was widespread opposition

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:31.590
to the war.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:34.650
Public opinion polls
said the same thing,

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.430
but marching in the streets made
us all feel better, of course.

00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:43.800
But also, brought it home.

00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:49.830
The other point I'm making
here in that second bullet

00:19:49.830 --> 00:19:50.790
is donors.

00:19:50.790 --> 00:19:53.550
I mean, gun control is
an interesting example

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:57.000
of the impact of salience
and the impact of an interest

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.620
group.

00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:01.560
Polls say that 70% of
Americans-- typically,

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.680
the number varies a little
bit, but 70% of Americans

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:07.320
would favor some gun
control, say limits

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.565
on assault weapons on campus.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:16.965
You-- or some restrictions
on carrying weapons.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.080
But most people don't care much.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.750
Every police chief
favors gun control.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:27.000
Most people don't care much.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.400
People who support
the National Rifle

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:33.630
Association, who oppose
gun control, care a lot,

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.980
and they win.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.800
Because the fact that
I favor gun control

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.480
is not going to cause
me, in most cases,

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:48.010
to change my vote on anything,
because that's rarely

00:20:48.010 --> 00:20:50.240
a big campaign issue.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.710
If I'm elected, I will enact--

00:20:53.710 --> 00:20:54.940
no.

00:20:54.940 --> 00:20:58.010
That's rarely a campaign issue.

00:20:58.010 --> 00:21:02.300
So those of us who care a
little bit don't do anything,

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:07.910
and those who care a lot and
have some money have control.

00:21:07.910 --> 00:21:10.150
So that's a concentrated
interest diffuse interest

00:21:10.150 --> 00:21:14.570
example of some importance.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:17.500
So the other ways we talked
about providing information.

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:21.970
You could argue that's
what happened in Vietnam.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.060
That's what happened
in East Germany.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:30.310
When-- I didn't put up
the demonstrations that

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:33.970
brought down the Berlin Wall,
but as distinct from the Arab

00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.730
Spring, nobody got shot, right?

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:38.750
That happened quickly.

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:40.520
They talked about
the Velvet Revolution

00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:47.380
in Czechoslovakia, talked
about in East Germany,

00:21:47.380 --> 00:21:49.390
nothing much happened.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:52.960
Crowds turned out,
crowds turned out.

00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.660
They didn't seize the
government buildings.

00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.460
They didn't overrun the
president's or prime minister's

00:22:00.460 --> 00:22:02.060
house.

00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:04.730
The government just
gave up and left.

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:09.420
So I think the argument
here is that they provided

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:11.540
enormous amount of
information to voters

00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:15.170
that you have no support.

00:22:15.170 --> 00:22:18.020
You're loathed.

00:22:18.020 --> 00:22:21.440
Changing preferences.

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.570
This often has to do
with reframing an issue.

00:22:24.570 --> 00:22:28.510
Think about the
pro-life movement,

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:31.610
which is a brilliant
piece of reframing.

00:22:31.610 --> 00:22:34.072
How can you be against life?

00:22:34.072 --> 00:22:36.280
I mean, you're for choice,
but what's more important,

00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:37.730
choice or life?

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:40.570
So you could argue that
reframing the issue as,

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:47.340
are you for or against life,
has an impact on preferences.

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:49.930
The attacks on the
health care legislation

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.730
by making it Obama's legislation
as opposed to, by the way,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.340
no pre-existing condition,
universal insurance, blah,

00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:00.310
blah, blah, changes
how it's thought of.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:02.860
It's something Obama is
shoving down our throats.

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:09.564
And you can argue that
Civil Rights did that,

00:23:09.564 --> 00:23:13.300
that that was the essence of
the Civil Rights Movement.

00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:19.390
That if you saw in real time
the marchers being taken down

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:24.340
with fire hoses, it was hard
not to think, that's just wrong.

00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.600
These people are marching.

00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.610
How can they--
why is that right?

00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:30.880
So and you don't do--

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:38.300
King's speeches were important,
but watching people peacefully

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:43.130
protest being beaten changes
your views of the people

00:23:43.130 --> 00:23:45.560
beating them and of the issue.

00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:48.260
So part of what they
do social movements

00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.290
is theater that changes
preferences as well

00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:57.290
as signals information.

00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:02.330
You can raise salience by
making people aware of an issue,

00:24:02.330 --> 00:24:06.740
but it only works if they
agree with you, right?

00:24:06.740 --> 00:24:09.070
I mean, think about
globalization,

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.040
the anti-globalization movement.

00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.320
So they protested globalization.

00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.980
They protested poor working
conditions in poor countries,

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.310
and they trashed Starbucks.

00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.890
And most people said what?

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.845
I'm sorry.

00:24:26.845 --> 00:24:29.440
If you're very sympathetic to
poor people, you say, yeah.

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.107
They should pay people
more in poor countries.

00:24:32.107 --> 00:24:33.690
And if you're not,
you say, well, they

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:35.273
don't have to take
the jobs, you know?

00:24:35.273 --> 00:24:39.220
I mean, they're not being forced
to work in these factories.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:41.600
It's more fun than
being in a village.

00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:49.540
So the example-- one of the
optional readings, C and G--

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:51.370
I forget now what
their initials are--

00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:54.250
make the point that
among people who

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:56.950
are for environmental
change and who

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:01.240
were opposed to environmental
change in a survey,

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:05.900
awareness of environmental
issues was equal.

00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.480
Values differed.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:11.630
So the policy
implications differed.

00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.400
So you make people
aware that there's

00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:16.400
a lot of international trade,
and a lot of what you buy

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.790
is produced by people
in poor countries,

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.890
one response is,
that's really terrible.

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.400
Another response is,
well, that's a market.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.010
And if people
mainly think, that's

00:25:28.010 --> 00:25:33.110
a market because
that's what they value,

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:36.760
making them more aware
of an issue won't help.

00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.430
You could argue the same thing
happens with climate change.

00:25:40.430 --> 00:25:42.370
There's been a lot of work--

00:25:42.370 --> 00:25:45.040
I wouldn't call it a movement,
but an awful lot of people

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:48.520
have spent a lot of time
trying to educate people

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.470
about climate change.

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.780
It has not produced
a groundswell.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.340
Quite the contrary.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.770
And the argument is that
it comes up against it's

00:25:59.770 --> 00:26:01.420
a conflict of values.

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.060
Do you want to have
economic growth,

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.440
or do you want to have
environmental protection?

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:10.990
We can both be aware of
climate change and its issues,

00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.360
but reach very different
policy conclusions.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:19.270
So raising salience only
works, raising awareness

00:26:19.270 --> 00:26:25.710
only works if there's agreement
or potential agreement,

00:26:25.710 --> 00:26:29.700
or something like agreement.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:33.838
And the final way, and
this is the borderline--

00:26:33.838 --> 00:26:35.255
this isn't really
social movement.

00:26:35.255 --> 00:26:39.060
I think the Burstein article
is, nonetheless, a good article.

00:26:39.060 --> 00:26:42.090
For interest groups, how do
interest groups affect policy?

00:26:42.090 --> 00:26:45.540
Well, they do all this
other stuff, right?

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:49.740
The National Rifle Association
does advertise, does--

00:26:49.740 --> 00:26:52.410
the Environmental Defense
Fund does send out mailings

00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.330
to people, so these
people do engage

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:59.400
in the organized petition
drives that do all this.

00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:04.880
But interest groups
work on implementation.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:07.460
That's inside baseball, right?

00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:11.810
So we'll talk about it
in the environmental case

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:14.780
next time when we
talk about what

00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:20.210
EPA did to set standards
a couple of times.

00:27:20.210 --> 00:27:25.160
But the Dodd-Frank law is the
big current example, right?

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.410
You can read about it in
the paper all the time.

00:27:27.410 --> 00:27:31.835
The law required lots
of regulations, set up

00:27:31.835 --> 00:27:34.430
some new entities, and it
required this regulation,

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:35.180
that regulation.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:38.000
Spell this out, make
this clear, hundreds,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.880
thousands of
regulations required.

00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.860
No votes in Congress.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:48.040
Really, really boring stuff.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.050
Who wins?

00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:54.070
The people who have
offices in Washington,

00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:57.670
who have lawyers, who have
staff, who have resources.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:01.090
It's not a matter of buying
votes in regulatory agencies.

00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:02.920
It's a matter of
providing information,

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.850
lobbying, per the piece we
had assigned for last time.

00:28:09.460 --> 00:28:14.710
When the issue has low
salience to the public--

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.920
interchange fees
on debit cards I

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.310
will tell you exercise the
entire banking industry,

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:23.770
and it may have
been in the Globe

00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:28.480
twice on the third
business page.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.840
Every banker in the
country was up in arms.

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.180
The Federal Reserve was
required to regulate that.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.750
It had enormous discretion.

00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:44.320
It was required to regulate
that fee paying due attention

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.240
to incremental costs.

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.090
Incremental costs
varied all over the lot.

00:28:49.090 --> 00:28:52.840
Hundreds of submissions went
into the Federal Reserve.

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:53.840
They made a decision.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.930
Yeah?

00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:57.272
AUDIENCE: So that's the
Durbin Amendment, right?

00:28:57.272 --> 00:28:59.230
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: The
Durbin Amendment, yep.

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:00.950
AUDIENCE: So when that--

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:04.810
so when that was approved,
the fact that, for instance,

00:29:04.810 --> 00:29:07.210
Bank of America started
charging monthly fee

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:08.710
for people when
they use their debit

00:29:08.710 --> 00:29:11.530
card to try to offset the
fact that they couldn't make

00:29:11.530 --> 00:29:15.302
as much money from
marginal cost--

00:29:15.302 --> 00:29:17.260
like the marginal revenue
that they had before.

00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:18.343
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:29:18.343 --> 00:29:20.920
AUDIENCE: But wouldn't that
cause people to care a lot?

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.045
Because at the end of the
day, the regular customer

00:29:23.045 --> 00:29:25.750
was the one who kind of got
screwed over a little bit,

00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:29.230
and the merchants
were the ones who won.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.140
But wouldn't
eventually like people

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:33.787
be against the Dodd-Frank?

00:29:33.787 --> 00:29:36.245
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Well, you
mean against that Amendment.

00:29:36.245 --> 00:29:37.000
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.750
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, I mean here's--

00:29:41.420 --> 00:29:46.930
here are the-- this was a
fight in which I participated.

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:50.080
Here's what happens
in the short run.

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:53.920
What happens in the short run
is merchants save a little bit

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:55.960
on debit card transactions.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.810
Not enough to cause
them to cut prices,

00:29:58.810 --> 00:30:00.700
because it's only a little bit.

00:30:00.700 --> 00:30:05.905
So one person, one large chain
said on a conference call--

00:30:05.905 --> 00:30:07.030
I think it was Home Depot--

00:30:07.030 --> 00:30:09.010
said on a conference
call that that

00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.820
was worth about $100 million
to them, short run profits.

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:14.740
So prices don't go down.

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.050
What happens to
banks is checking

00:30:17.050 --> 00:30:19.700
accounts are now
less profitable,

00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:23.200
so they look to
recoup in other ways.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:25.600
They tried the monthly fee.

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:26.470
That didn't work.

00:30:26.470 --> 00:30:30.490
The easiest thing to do, and
what they've done quietly,

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:32.620
is they've raised the
minimum balances required

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:35.740
for free checking.

00:30:35.740 --> 00:30:38.050
And we'll see the
numbers, but checking,

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:42.520
because of these fees, if
you use the debit card a lot,

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:44.380
the bank is--

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.690
you're profitable to the
bank even if you don't leave

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:49.120
a lot of money on deposit.

00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:52.070
Take away those fees,
you're no longer profitable.

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:54.070
So they start raising
the minimum requirement

00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:55.900
for free checking,
and the number

00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.950
of people without
checking accounts goes up.

00:30:58.950 --> 00:31:01.260
So, I mean, that's the
predictable consequence

00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.450
of the amendment.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:11.127
It was pushed by merchants,
and Senator Durbin

00:31:11.127 --> 00:31:13.710
talked about his friend, I think
it was a hardware store owner

00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.280
or drug store owner, who was
being taken to the cleaners

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.980
by these fees.

00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:20.010
So he's presumably happy.

00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:22.920
In the long run, costs
get passed through.

00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:24.990
It's just they're frictions
to changing prices,

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:28.110
so in the short run they don't.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:31.140
In the long run,
prices adjust up.

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:37.150
People pay slightly
more if they use cash.

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.950
So-- but this is a typical--

00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:45.550
this is a-- this is an
extreme piece of legislation.

00:31:45.550 --> 00:31:48.810
It was not debated, really.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:49.940
It got a floor vote--

00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:56.850
a quick floor vote, not much
material on it anywhere.

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:58.710
It said to the Federal
Reserve, neglect

00:31:58.710 --> 00:32:02.005
the fixed costs of running these
programs when you set a price.

00:32:02.005 --> 00:32:04.350
Wait, what?

00:32:04.350 --> 00:32:05.850
They have to cover
the fixed cost.

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.570
OK, neglect the fixed costs,
and it instructed the Fed

00:32:09.570 --> 00:32:11.010
to consider marginal cost.

00:32:11.010 --> 00:32:13.200
The Fed ran a survey.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:15.840
Marginal costs varied by
roughly an order of magnitude

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:17.640
across banks.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:20.610
OK, now what do you do?

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.180
And they came out
with a proposed rule.

00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:26.010
There was the expected howling.

00:32:26.010 --> 00:32:28.810
They doubled the ceiling.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:29.970
There was less howling.

00:32:29.970 --> 00:32:31.170
Life goes on.

00:32:31.170 --> 00:32:33.570
But yeah, it'll have
the effect of increasing

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:35.650
the number of unbanked people.

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:37.230
It's not as serious
as it used to be

00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:40.560
not to have a bank account,
but it's still pretty serious.

00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.967
So yeah.

00:32:41.967 --> 00:32:43.800
The Durbin Amendment,
you follow this stuff.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.090
That's amazing.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.130
It's not even energy.

00:32:47.130 --> 00:32:49.410
Anything else while I pause
for breath and anecdote?

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:49.910
Yeah?

00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.118
AUDIENCE: Can you tell us
a little bit about the role

00:32:52.118 --> 00:32:54.090
that social media has
paid like how to mobilize

00:32:54.090 --> 00:32:55.450
all these different publics?

00:32:55.450 --> 00:33:01.210
Like, I can see with Occupy Wall
Street and Occupy Everything

00:33:01.210 --> 00:33:02.460
how [INAUDIBLE] come together.

00:33:02.460 --> 00:33:02.973
I saw that.

00:33:02.973 --> 00:33:04.890
But something like the
Civil Rights Movement--

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:06.855
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: But it's
a little less clear, isn't it,

00:33:06.855 --> 00:33:07.650
how--

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:10.320
the Occupy Movement,
I find mysterious.

00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:11.910
Because the Civil
Rights Movement

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:14.310
had a set of
charismatic leaders.

00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:18.000
It had some clear objectives,
and it had great media

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.770
coverage, right?

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:23.790
I mean, when those
kids went to-- where

00:33:23.790 --> 00:33:27.210
was it that the Civil
rights workers got shot?

00:33:27.210 --> 00:33:28.830
Selma, maybe?

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:30.810
Boy, that coverage of
three college students

00:33:30.810 --> 00:33:33.060
go down to help the
black community organize

00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:37.620
in Selma, Alabama and get shot
for their troubles, that woke

00:33:37.620 --> 00:33:40.020
people up in an amazing way.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:43.920
And when you watch them
fire hose the marchers,

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:45.210
that was galvanizing.

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:49.380
And when Dr. Martin Luther
King spoke, that was, oh, gee.

00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:51.180
There is something here.

00:33:51.180 --> 00:33:53.610
Occupy was mysterious.

00:33:53.610 --> 00:33:55.995
Occupy just happened.

00:33:55.995 --> 00:33:57.418
I don't know.

00:33:57.418 --> 00:33:57.960
I don't know.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:03.330
These things-- and the
anti-globalization, similarly.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:07.680
What was-- I can point
to triggering events.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:11.130
You go back to the
Rosa Parks refusing

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:15.780
to sit in the back of the bus,
people moving into integrated

00:34:15.780 --> 00:34:19.610
lunch counters, all of this
getting media attention.

00:34:19.610 --> 00:34:21.780
I can see-- the triggering
events in Civil Rights

00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:22.280
were clear.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:24.969
The triggering event in
Vietnam was pretty clear.

00:34:24.969 --> 00:34:30.670
It just went on and on, and
thinking about thousands

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.560
of people chanting,
hey, hey, LBJ.

00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.804
How many kids did
you kill today?

00:34:35.804 --> 00:34:37.179
Those are pretty
dramatic things.

00:34:37.179 --> 00:34:41.637
But Occupy, I don't know
what triggered Occupy.

00:34:41.637 --> 00:34:43.929
I also don't know what
triggered the anti-globalization

00:34:43.929 --> 00:34:45.760
movement.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.110
We know the Arab Spring.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.090
We know it was the--

00:34:49.090 --> 00:34:51.190
normally, there's something.

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:54.070
The guy in Tunisia who burned
himself to death in protest.

00:34:54.070 --> 00:34:56.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
but like how people

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.330
are mobilizing come together.

00:34:58.330 --> 00:35:00.020
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, now you--

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.620
now people point
to, particularly

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:06.970
in the case of Egypt, it was
much discussed social media.

00:35:06.970 --> 00:35:09.700
You can organize through
Twitter and Facebook

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.460
and various other
connections, and just things

00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:15.310
going viral in a variety
of ways through people's

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:16.600
personal networks.

00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:18.610
You can organize.

00:35:18.610 --> 00:35:20.590
Vietnam was posters.

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.490
There will be a rally today,

00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:25.050
AUDIENCE: There was a
leader that called it all.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:26.800
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
There were people who

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.415
appointed themselves leaders.

00:35:28.415 --> 00:35:30.040
You put up a poster
and you say there's

00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.010
going to be a demonstration
today in [INAUDIBLE] well,

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:38.410
it was then the great court,
nobody had to show up.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.960
If people weren't
ready to do something,

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:43.720
you can imagine calling
a rally and nobody comes.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:44.860
That happens often enough.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:54.713
This, as far as I know,
and undoubtedly there's--

00:35:54.713 --> 00:35:56.380
people have written
boring papers on it,

00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:59.290
but it strikes me just
as an observer of history

00:35:59.290 --> 00:36:01.840
that it's a bit
mysterious what does it.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.010
It's a bit mysterious.

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:09.790
So guy burns himself
to death in Tunisia.

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:11.910
Why does that spread?

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.530
What triggers that?

00:36:13.530 --> 00:36:16.860
Did somebody in Egypt set
himself up or herself up

00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:18.540
as a leader and began
saying, hey, we're

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.340
going to meet in
the square tomorrow,

00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:24.240
and then gradually it
built. It did build

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.090
from a relatively small group.

00:36:28.090 --> 00:36:33.220
But in Moscow, there are
protests that have lost,

00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.360
have plainly lost.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:38.110
Their anti-Putin protests
in Russia, they were small.

00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.640
I don't know how they happened.

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:40.690
They weren't sufficient.

00:36:40.690 --> 00:36:42.670
They dissipated.

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:44.843
So it doesn't always happen.

00:36:44.843 --> 00:36:45.760
Doesn't always happen.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.010
Andrew?

00:36:48.010 --> 00:36:51.340
AUDIENCE: Just as-- it
might be an extreme,

00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:54.080
could someone argue
that, especially

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:58.270
in, say, for the Arab Spring
movements, that violence

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.960
or the threat of
violence, or blackmail

00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:05.410
or the threat of just
physically destroying something

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:08.640
is a means of affecting
public policy?

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.800
So not votes, just
the fact that there's

00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.975
a big body out there that will
affect the way the country

00:37:14.975 --> 00:37:15.475
is run.

00:37:15.475 --> 00:37:18.520
So let's read their demands.

00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:20.320
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Well, a standard thing

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.710
that happens, although in France
it tends to be well organized,

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.810
mass strikes.

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:28.870
You can call it-- you
call a general strike.

00:37:28.870 --> 00:37:31.420
And if the general
strike is effective,

00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:34.305
you've demonstrated
that you have the--

00:37:34.305 --> 00:37:35.680
that enough--
you've demonstrated

00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:38.980
there are enough people
care enough about the issue

00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.880
to do something.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.230
I don't know if it has
to be physical violence,

00:37:42.230 --> 00:37:44.050
but I think it has
to be an action.

00:37:44.050 --> 00:37:47.210
Because that's how you
demonstrate that you care,

00:37:47.210 --> 00:37:47.710
right?

00:37:47.710 --> 00:37:50.380
I mean, now, of course, you
just send an email to Congress.

00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.005
No, that doesn't
really say that you're

00:37:52.005 --> 00:37:54.280
very excited about the issue.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.720
If you go out and
march, you stand

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:58.210
in the hot sun for a few
hours, it demonstrates it.

00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:03.850
The story of the
Civil Rights Movement

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:05.620
is kind of the reverse, right?

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:10.540
There was no threat of
violence from the activists.

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:14.560
It was the violence from
those acting against them

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.940
that really built support.

00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.330
It was Dr. King's
nonviolent strategy

00:38:19.330 --> 00:38:23.980
which worked beyond
anything I've seen.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:27.670
In the anti-Vietnam, people
were pretty nonviolent, too.

00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:30.880
I don't think it mattered much.

00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:33.160
Occupy has been nonviolent.

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:37.570
The Tea Party, been a little
shrill but nonviolent.

00:38:37.570 --> 00:38:40.360
Tea Party's had some effect
politically in the Republican

00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:40.990
Party.

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:45.670
The Occupy Movement seems to
have vanished in the night.

00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:48.514
So it's a little bit mysterious.

00:38:48.514 --> 00:38:50.940
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] because
you mentioned strikes.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.680
Because one another where
would that category [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.040
So say some people
said, I don't know,

00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.790
like tomorrow all
bus drivers decided

00:39:00.790 --> 00:39:01.980
that they want to strike.

00:39:01.980 --> 00:39:05.910
So for some reason actually
that's more pertinent in Europe

00:39:05.910 --> 00:39:08.460
where transportation is, but
I guess I've seen it happen.

00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:09.960
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Those are those

00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.280
tend to be very heavily union.

00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.460
That's why I talked
about a general strike.

00:39:13.460 --> 00:39:16.440
AUDIENCE: So I was going
to say, even for a union.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.860
So because it's a
relatively small body,

00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:22.170
but because it exhibits a big--

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:24.060
a lot of power and
the fact that we

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:27.350
will have buses or
the subway tomorrow,

00:39:27.350 --> 00:39:33.840
will bother a bigger
majority of people.

00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.060
And basically, that's
almost like blackmail.

00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.292
So you're influencing what
the majority of people

00:39:39.292 --> 00:39:40.500
is thinking about this issue.

00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:43.500
It's not that it's
directly influencing

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.543
what you're asking for, which
could be wages for bus drivers.

00:39:46.543 --> 00:39:48.960
But they're so frustrated that
we don't have buses, so OK,

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.730
let's give them the
wages because they're

00:39:50.730 --> 00:39:51.480
causing all this--

00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:52.500
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
But it can fail.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.220
It could fail.

00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.020
There was a-- I was
reading recently

00:39:55.020 --> 00:39:59.190
a fictionalized treatment of the
famous police strike in Boston

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:00.990
in 1919.

00:40:00.990 --> 00:40:03.420
That strike, police
hadn't been paid.

00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.030
They were underpaid, hadn't
gotten a raise in 30 years

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:08.670
kind of thing, badly underpaid.

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:09.780
They struck.

00:40:09.780 --> 00:40:12.570
There was a crime wave.

00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:15.420
The police completely
lost the popular sympathy,

00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.420
and lots of them were fired and
jailed and all kinds of things.

00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:20.910
So that was the threat.

00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:22.680
They carried out the threat.

00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.630
People got very, very angry,
made Calvin Coolidge president

00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:32.050
because of how drastically he
reacted against the strike.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:37.830
So it's not necessarily
a winning strategy.

00:40:37.830 --> 00:40:41.338
It's not necessarily
a winning strategy.

00:40:41.338 --> 00:40:41.880
Another hand?

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.433
Yeah?

00:40:42.433 --> 00:40:44.850
AUDIENCE: I'm confused by the
difference between the first

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:46.477
and the second strategies.

00:40:46.477 --> 00:40:48.060
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
The first-- yeah.

00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:49.620
I must say reading
that reading the paper,

00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.620
I was a little confused
about his argument, too.

00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:55.650
He said, well, can you
just walk in and say,

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.450
I'm opposed to the Vietnam War.

00:40:57.450 --> 00:41:02.310
I've got-- there are bunch of
us and here are my arguments.

00:41:02.310 --> 00:41:05.640
And I think what he's saying
is, that's not going to work.

00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:09.870
Social movements
work by demonstrating

00:41:09.870 --> 00:41:14.070
that it matters
to enough people,

00:41:14.070 --> 00:41:16.050
that you have to
take it into account.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:19.290
And if the policymaker
knows that it

00:41:19.290 --> 00:41:21.510
matters enough to
a lot of people,

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:23.870
you don't need a
social movement.

00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:25.620
And if it doesn't--

00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:30.250
Occupy-- if it doesn't, the
movement won't have any effect.

00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:32.430
I think that's what he's saying.

00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:34.620
In my money, in
social movements,

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:38.820
what you want to think about
is to think about these three.

00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:42.420
Are you persuading people
that a lot of people care?

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:45.210
Are you making-- changing
people's preferences

00:41:45.210 --> 00:41:46.110
toward an issue?

00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:48.690
Are you making them
more aware of an issue

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:50.850
and making it more important?

00:41:50.850 --> 00:41:52.770
You could be aware of fracking.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.800
You could make it more important
in people's-- in people's minds

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.120
by providing information.

00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:59.190
You could raise salience
either by awareness

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:02.670
or on the important side.

00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:05.580
And this is an inside
baseball story.

00:42:05.580 --> 00:42:07.770
So I share your confusion
about the first.

00:42:07.770 --> 00:42:10.400
I confess, I read his
argument on the first one

00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:14.450
and I said, well, what
would that look like?

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:21.570
The closest thing I can
think of is maybe in Vietnam

00:42:21.570 --> 00:42:23.550
there was some
persuasion, but I think

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.850
what Vietnam was
all about was this,

00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:30.690
was letting people know that
a large part of the population

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.160
was passionate.

00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.650
And that's what happened
in Czechoslovakia,

00:42:34.650 --> 00:42:39.450
in East Germany, and generally
throughout Eastern Europe.

00:42:39.450 --> 00:42:41.040
Once it became
clear the Russians

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.350
weren't going to
intervene militarily,

00:42:43.350 --> 00:42:45.330
and it became clear
to the government

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:49.650
that they had no popular
support, game over.

00:42:49.650 --> 00:42:50.310
Game over.

00:42:50.310 --> 00:42:50.977
Yeah?

00:42:50.977 --> 00:42:52.560
AUDIENCE: I'm not
sure if I'm correct,

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:57.270
but my theory, my [INAUDIBLE]
theory for the Occupy Movement,

00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:59.730
is that it wasn't
necessarily [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:59.730 --> 00:43:00.930
by any particular event.

00:43:00.930 --> 00:43:04.428
However, there was-- since
the financial crisis and then

00:43:04.428 --> 00:43:06.970
all the economic problems that
were happening in the country.

00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:09.720
I think there were just a
lot of people unsatisfied

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.070
with the current status.

00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:13.740
But I don't think that would
have been enough to trigger

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.585
that movement in--

00:43:15.585 --> 00:43:16.860
for this particular case.

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:20.460
I think the actual people,
the initial leaders

00:43:20.460 --> 00:43:22.335
who tried to convince
people, those

00:43:22.335 --> 00:43:23.460
are really the key players.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.460
I don't think that's
something that would have--

00:43:25.460 --> 00:43:27.840
that was bound to happen,
regardless of whether or not

00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:29.100
someone had started.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:30.300
I don't think it would
have been something

00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:32.010
that if it didn't
happen then, it would

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:33.450
have happened two months after.

00:43:33.450 --> 00:43:35.940
I just think that the people
who initially organized it

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:37.410
did a really good job.

00:43:37.410 --> 00:43:42.580
They [INAUDIBLE] this
anarchy concept of--

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:47.010
they had all those masks of
that movie V for Vendetta.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:49.800
And they [INAUDIBLE]
that image, and they

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:53.220
were just very secretive about
how they attracted people.

00:43:53.220 --> 00:43:54.930
They became viral
and [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:54.930 --> 00:43:55.700
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Became viral,

00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:57.158
but what's interesting
is you point

00:43:57.158 --> 00:43:59.340
to the particular leaders.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:02.945
I mean, they occupied Portland,
Oregon for heaven's sakes.

00:44:02.945 --> 00:44:03.810
What was that about?

00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:05.850
This was a protest
against global capitalism?

00:44:05.850 --> 00:44:07.330
Have you been to
Portland, Oregon?

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.350
I mean, this is not
the financial hub

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:11.910
of the Western
world with millions

00:44:11.910 --> 00:44:14.470
of people getting rich on the
backs of the masses, right?

00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:15.600
It's a pretty mellow place.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:17.280
But they occupied Portland.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:22.590
So they occupied
a lot of places.

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:23.160
I give up.

00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:23.790
Let me move on.

00:44:23.790 --> 00:44:24.600
Yeah, Julian?

00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:27.097
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:27.097 --> 00:44:29.430
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: I was
going to try, but undoubtedly

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:30.390
as profound.

00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:32.010
Give it a shot.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:36.285
AUDIENCE: I think, [INAUDIBLE]
it's kind of the precipitation

00:44:36.285 --> 00:44:43.840
of a general sentiment that the
government isn't necessarily

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:47.937
benefiting [INAUDIBLE]
I feel like [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:47.937 --> 00:44:50.270
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Which
is exactly what the Tea Party

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:52.670
people thought, too,
which is interesting.

00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:53.610
I mean that's it.

00:44:53.610 --> 00:44:55.610
There's something wrong
in Washington, something

00:44:55.610 --> 00:44:58.830
wrong with a
different diagnosis.

00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:00.080
AUDIENCE: Different diagnosis.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:03.770
I mean, very different ideas
in the Tea Party movement.

00:45:03.770 --> 00:45:11.150
But it's just a general
precipitation of some things

00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:16.220
wrong you don't necessarily like
it from a financial statement.

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.550
The grand majority of
people that took place in--

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:22.730
they don't necessarily
know what is wrong

00:45:22.730 --> 00:45:24.720
or exactly how to
fix it to begin with.

00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:28.910
So I think that's one of
the reasons why it died out

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:32.357
is that it just became a
general shout of, I'm angry.

00:45:32.357 --> 00:45:33.440
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yeah.

00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.542
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] nothing--

00:45:35.542 --> 00:45:38.000
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: And you
saw a lot of movements of the,

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.390
I'm angry variety during
the Great Depression,

00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:42.710
from both left and right.

00:45:42.710 --> 00:45:47.360
So it does-- you do
get this in hard times.

00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:49.046
There was a--

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:53.720
I think sometime in the
'30s, there was a World War I

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.850
veterans March on
Washington because pensions

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:56.960
weren't adequate.

00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:00.500
And you got the rise of both
extreme left and extreme

00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:02.810
right political
groups on the grounds

00:46:02.810 --> 00:46:04.590
that it's just not right.

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:09.050
The Tea Party movement has
more heft because it actually

00:46:09.050 --> 00:46:12.260
has clearer objectives, right?

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.480
There's a caucus in Congress.

00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:17.000
There are relatively
organized groups

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.730
in some congressional districts.

00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:21.410
Tea Party backing is a big deal.

00:46:21.410 --> 00:46:24.020
They have a convention,
so they've made themselves

00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:30.100
into an interest group from a
movement, interestingly enough.

00:46:30.100 --> 00:46:32.395
With a little incoherence.

00:46:32.395 --> 00:46:34.480
There was a split
between the Boston Tea

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:37.570
Party and the Worcester
Tea Party recently,

00:46:37.570 --> 00:46:40.432
so they had separate rallies.

00:46:40.432 --> 00:46:41.890
The Worcester Tea
Party said, we're

00:46:41.890 --> 00:46:45.130
all about low taxes and limited
government and stuff like that.

00:46:45.130 --> 00:46:46.840
And the Boston Tea
Party said, yeah,

00:46:46.840 --> 00:46:48.558
and we hate gay marriage, too.

00:46:48.558 --> 00:46:50.350
And the Worcester people
said, no, maybe we

00:46:50.350 --> 00:46:51.880
ought to just stay focused.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.930
So they split.

00:46:52.930 --> 00:46:54.790
Anyway.

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:56.620
OK.

00:46:56.620 --> 00:47:00.520
To get a little
closer to this course

00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:05.350
and a little less abstract,
there's an interesting--

00:47:05.350 --> 00:47:08.080
the other assigned
paper is [INAUDIBLE]

00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.550
which is about nuclear power.

00:47:14.140 --> 00:47:19.510
And they trace the partial
evolution of the politics here.

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:21.160
What did the politics
of nuclear power

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.530
look like in the '50s and '60s?

00:47:23.530 --> 00:47:25.420
Movements, interest
groups, what?

00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.303
That was a hand?

00:47:30.303 --> 00:47:31.220
No, it was not waving.

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.340
OK.

00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:32.917
Yeah.

00:47:32.917 --> 00:47:33.750
Brandon, you got it.

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:34.632
OK.

00:47:34.632 --> 00:47:36.840
AUDIENCE: I think it was
kind of like, let's do this.

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:39.378
This is gonna be-- it's gonna
cost pennies to-- it's going

00:47:39.378 --> 00:47:40.170
to cost you penny--

00:47:40.170 --> 00:47:42.462
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Too
cheap to meter was the phrase.

00:47:42.462 --> 00:47:43.358
Too cheap to meter.

00:47:43.358 --> 00:47:44.816
AUDIENCE: It was
very enthusiastic.

00:47:44.816 --> 00:47:46.110
The navy was going nuclear.

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:47.902
There was a lot of
proliferation technology

00:47:47.902 --> 00:47:51.090
out there so these reactors
were ready to build.

00:47:51.090 --> 00:47:53.420
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
And the politics

00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:56.810
was industry interest
groups, right?

00:47:56.810 --> 00:48:01.650
There were-- the paper
labeled a bunch of them.

00:48:01.650 --> 00:48:03.320
The big thing, their
big win was there's

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:07.730
a limit still in force
on the liability of any--

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.530
related to any nuclear facility.

00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:11.600
The Atomic Energy
Commission was regulatory,

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:16.790
but it also was promoting Atomic
Energy as well as regulating.

00:48:16.790 --> 00:48:20.330
So it was like the early
years of airline travel

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:25.700
where what politics
there was was positive,

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:31.040
industry groups dominated,
inside the beltway stuff.

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:34.520
Not much in the media, except
for cheap, swell, good, clean,

00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:36.950
et cetera.

00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:38.150
What happened in the '70s?

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:42.420
Yeah?

00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:44.980
AUDIENCE: It was a
combination of a movie called

00:48:44.980 --> 00:48:47.700
The China Syndrome that came
out and then Three Mile Island--

00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.310
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
China Syndrome

00:48:48.310 --> 00:48:49.590
might have been a little
later, but go ahead.

00:48:49.590 --> 00:48:50.250
Not much later.

00:48:50.250 --> 00:48:50.942
AUDIENCE: They were similar.

00:48:50.942 --> 00:48:51.290
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:52.820
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It followed
Three Mile Island a little bit.

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:55.450
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Three Mile Island happened,

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:58.270
which seemed to mimic the
movie with like, oh geez,

00:48:58.270 --> 00:48:59.200
this is reality.

00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.510
It's actually dangerous.

00:49:00.510 --> 00:49:01.927
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
And you began

00:49:01.927 --> 00:49:03.960
to get a different kind
of politics, right?

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.280
Politically, what did you get?

00:49:10.516 --> 00:49:12.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.520
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
I showed you.

00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.260
What was on that slide?

00:49:16.260 --> 00:49:17.800
You've got an
anti-nuclear movement.

00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.140
You've got people marching.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.850
You've got protests.

00:49:20.850 --> 00:49:23.910
All of a sudden, you had these
industry groups in Washington

00:49:23.910 --> 00:49:28.200
with guys in suits and other
capitals for that matter.

00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:30.030
It wasn't just an
American phenomenon.

00:49:30.030 --> 00:49:33.780
And then you begin to
have those German marchers

00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:38.220
and the Japanese marchers
and Vermont is recent,

00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.660
but you had American marchers.

00:49:39.660 --> 00:49:43.500
You began to get an anti-nuclear
movement with protests.

00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:48.570
And after Three Mile Island,
the industry stopped.

00:49:48.570 --> 00:49:50.640
Now this is the neat
part, which I actually

00:49:50.640 --> 00:49:53.850
wasn't aware of until
I saw the article.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:57.760
What did the industry try
to do to react to this?

00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.658
Do you have the guys
in suits in Washington?

00:49:59.658 --> 00:50:00.700
Are they a good reaction?

00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:01.200
Yeah?

00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:03.850
AUDIENCE: They tried to form
their own pro-nuclear movement.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.880
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: They try
to do a pro-nuclear movement.

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.945
Did it work?

00:50:07.945 --> 00:50:09.340
AUDIENCE: Not really.

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.230
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: How come?

00:50:11.230 --> 00:50:14.440
AUDIENCE: Well, the article
mentions like the anti-nuclear

00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:19.204
movement came from the people,
and they all felt like he--

00:50:19.204 --> 00:50:22.550
or that an industry-backed
movement [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:26.300
so they were set
apart from the masses.

00:50:26.300 --> 00:50:28.850
And then [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:28.850 --> 00:50:30.920
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
So they tried to do it,

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:34.870
but they really had trouble
making it authentic.

00:50:34.870 --> 00:50:39.200
The anti-nuclear movement was
mom and pop and your uncle

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.600
and people really upset,
and the pro-nuclear movement

00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:46.790
was industry people
with their ties off.

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.580
The phrase they use
in the businesses

00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:54.470
to distinguish between
grassroots and AstroTurf.

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.900
Grassroots movements
are really genuine

00:50:56.900 --> 00:50:58.910
and reflect popular sentiment.

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:02.390
AstroTurf is created, right?

00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:05.240
You can see it when
you get emails--

00:51:05.240 --> 00:51:08.630
when a congressional office gets
emails on an issue and they're

00:51:08.630 --> 00:51:11.030
all identical.

00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:12.620
You say, oh.

00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:14.570
That's AstroTurf.

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:18.410
Somebody is really
pushing people to send--

00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:23.120
somebody's saying to all their
employees, send this email.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:25.640
That's not people
being passionate.

00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:29.510
And it just didn't
work, didn't work.

00:51:29.510 --> 00:51:31.640
It was an attempt
to create a movement

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:33.740
to affect energy policy.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:34.400
Didn't work.

00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:40.700
There's not a lot of social
movements in energy directly.

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:44.300
You see them more on
the environmental side.

00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.510
And the piece by [? Rooked-- ?]
but environmental movements

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:49.370
affect energy, so it's
worth talking about.

00:51:52.210 --> 00:51:56.950
That's a depressing article,
if you read the first part

00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:58.570
in a bad mood.

00:51:58.570 --> 00:52:00.490
Because he says the
environment's gotten worse

00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:02.770
and species are getting
extinct, and we're

00:52:02.770 --> 00:52:04.570
depleting natural resources.

00:52:04.570 --> 00:52:07.420
I would just argue that he's
measuring against the past,

00:52:07.420 --> 00:52:08.920
not against what
would have happened

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:12.520
but for the environmental
movement since the air

00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:15.370
and the water in US and
Europe and many other places

00:52:15.370 --> 00:52:17.950
has improved notably.

00:52:17.950 --> 00:52:22.240
Nobody believes that, but
those are the numbers.

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:26.650
He argues-- so he's
trying to be quantitative.

00:52:26.650 --> 00:52:31.510
He says that an
environmental movement can

00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:34.600
work through lobbying, can
work through public opinion,

00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:38.290
can work through
individual attitudes,

00:52:38.290 --> 00:52:42.830
or through a Green Party,
as exist in some countries.

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.980
And the reason he does
this rather than thinking

00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.950
about the ways we just finished
talking about, the more general

00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:53.145
ways, is he's got measures
of all these things.

00:52:53.145 --> 00:52:57.510
He's got measures of how
big the green movement is.

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:59.520
He's got measures
of public opinion.

00:52:59.520 --> 00:53:03.243
He's got measures of
attitudes of various kinds,

00:53:03.243 --> 00:53:05.160
and he certainly knows
whether there's a Green

00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:06.870
Party that gets any votes.

00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:09.630
So he can measure
these channels,

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:14.470
and he gives you
this nice picture.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:19.620
So environmental movements
react to environmental problems.

00:53:19.620 --> 00:53:21.780
I think interpreted
largely via sciences

00:53:21.780 --> 00:53:24.340
is a little too
optimistic, but perceive

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:26.310
problems they can lobby.

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.620
They can be an interest group.

00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:32.700
The Environmental Defense Fund,
the Natural Resources Defense

00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:35.910
Council, the Friends of
the Earth, the Sierra Club.

00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.260
There are more.

00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:43.800
I'm trying to think of a few,
but they lobby as well as do

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.970
other things.

00:53:45.970 --> 00:53:48.240
And so here are his channels.

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:56.430
So he has this very
interesting table.

00:53:56.430 --> 00:53:59.340
Based on a set of
measures, he looks

00:53:59.340 --> 00:54:03.870
at the strength of
environmental pressure groups.

00:54:03.870 --> 00:54:06.870
He looks, based on
opinion polls, attitudes

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:08.560
toward the environment.

00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:14.100
Is there a Green Party, and
how strong is the policy

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:17.340
and what's happened
to the environment?

00:54:17.340 --> 00:54:22.890
It's interesting, the
US scores high in terms

00:54:22.890 --> 00:54:26.510
of the environmental
pressure group.

00:54:26.510 --> 00:54:29.660
We're kind of in the middle
in terms of attitudes.

00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.640
We don't have a Green Party.

00:54:31.640 --> 00:54:33.470
A lot of places don't
have green parties,

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:36.680
and we're kind of in the
middle on policy efforts, which

00:54:36.680 --> 00:54:40.110
I think is, compared
to these countries,

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:46.790
I think is not far
off the mark roughly.

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:49.240
And we're in the middle in
terms of Environmental Quality.

00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.830
I forget how he measures that.

00:54:50.830 --> 00:54:54.650
That's a tough one because he's
got so many different things.

00:54:54.650 --> 00:55:00.220
But this is the summary, his
summary of how these work.

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:02.590
And I must say--

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:03.760
so what he did was--

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:10.010
to be clear, the US
gets a three here.

00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:11.750
It gets a two here.

00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:13.550
It gets a one here.

00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:15.350
It gets a one there.

00:55:15.350 --> 00:55:18.330
And a one-- sorry, a two
there and a two there.

00:55:18.330 --> 00:55:19.220
This is three.

00:55:19.220 --> 00:55:20.240
This is two.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.380
This is one.

00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:24.140
And then he looks
at correlations,

00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:27.460
which is not obviously
the right way to do it.

00:55:27.460 --> 00:55:30.930
It's not, I would say,
the wrong way to do it.

00:55:30.930 --> 00:55:32.300
But here they are.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:36.540
OK.

00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:41.160
So reading across, an
environmental pressure group

00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:44.790
is most strongly associated
with the strength of policy

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:46.890
across countries.

00:55:46.890 --> 00:55:50.610
Has very little to do with
whether there's a Green Party

00:55:50.610 --> 00:55:53.910
or not, the stars or
statistical significance.

00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:57.930
Very little to do with whether
there's a Green Party or not.

00:55:57.930 --> 00:56:00.210
Why don't we have a Green
Party in the United States?

00:56:05.470 --> 00:56:06.469
Brendan?

00:56:06.469 --> 00:56:07.594
AUDIENCE: I thought we did.

00:56:07.594 --> 00:56:09.490
Wasn't that Ralph
Nader [INAUDIBLE]??

00:56:09.490 --> 00:56:10.670
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Oh.

00:56:10.670 --> 00:56:12.500
Is that what he called it?

00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:13.660
OK.

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:14.903
We might have once.

00:56:14.903 --> 00:56:15.820
We don't have one now.

00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.110
They do in Germany.

00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:20.330
Various other countries do.

00:56:20.330 --> 00:56:23.093
Well, Julian?

00:56:23.093 --> 00:56:25.518
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
it's just insignificant.

00:56:25.518 --> 00:56:26.810
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: It's what?

00:56:26.810 --> 00:56:27.710
AUDIENCE: It's
just insignificant.

00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:28.580
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Insignificant.

00:56:28.580 --> 00:56:28.850
Yeah.

00:56:28.850 --> 00:56:29.900
Well, maybe that's it.

00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.845
Why don't we have one
that's significant?

00:56:31.845 --> 00:56:33.553
AUDIENCE: Well, we've
always been heavily

00:56:33.553 --> 00:56:36.496
polarized [INAUDIBLE]
Democrats or Republicans.

00:56:36.496 --> 00:56:38.912
It's really hard for any
party to break into that

00:56:38.912 --> 00:56:40.620
and make a three party
system, especially

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:45.022
a Green, which is like a
subset of the Democratic party.

00:56:45.022 --> 00:56:46.730
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
It's very important.

00:56:46.730 --> 00:56:49.940
Our electoral rules are
pretty important as they

00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:51.770
are in some countries.

00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:58.250
In some countries, you vote for
the party, not the candidate.

00:56:58.250 --> 00:57:01.700
And the party has
representation in parliament,

00:57:01.700 --> 00:57:04.280
depending on the percentage
of the votes it gets.

00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.630
In that case, a Green Party
could get 5%, 6% of the votes

00:57:08.630 --> 00:57:11.510
and have somebody in Washington.

00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:14.540
Here, you've got to win a
majority to get into the house,

00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:16.700
to get into the Senate.

00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:18.680
It's very tough
for third parties

00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.840
of any kind in our system.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.490
Not in all systems.

00:57:22.490 --> 00:57:25.400
I wouldn't say we're heavily--
we're heavily polarized now.

00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:28.235
The Republican and Democratic
parties used to overlap more.

00:57:28.235 --> 00:57:31.040
You used to actually have
conservative Democrats who

00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.200
were more conservative
than liberal Republicans,

00:57:33.200 --> 00:57:35.730
believe it or not.

00:57:35.730 --> 00:57:42.020
So one of the reasons for
this is electoral laws.

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:50.470
But it's-- this is the
strongest correlation he's got.

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:52.090
And that's between
the importance

00:57:52.090 --> 00:57:55.660
of environmental pressure groups
and the strength of policy

00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.510
efforts to preserve
the environment, which

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:00.790
is sort of interesting.

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:04.660
He says the environmental
movement does matter.

00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:08.140
He called-- the environmental
movement pressure.

00:58:08.140 --> 00:58:12.640
If you think about it in
the US, we don't actually

00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:18.960
have a lot of marches and
rallies for the environment.

00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:22.140
We have interest
groups in Washington.

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.560
The Environmental Defense Fund,
the Sierra Club, the this,

00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.290
the that.

00:58:25.290 --> 00:58:28.080
So there are not a lot of
non-conventional actions being

00:58:28.080 --> 00:58:29.670
done to save the environment.

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:32.280
There was a time in
the Pacific Northwest

00:58:32.280 --> 00:58:34.740
when people would drive
iron spikes into trees

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.300
to prevent logging.

00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:38.910
You don't hear much
of that anymore.

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:42.720
You don't hear people chaining
themselves to a nuclear power

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.650
plant much anymore.

00:58:44.650 --> 00:58:47.220
So at this point,
we're lobbying.

00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:48.845
Other places, stronger.

00:58:48.845 --> 00:58:50.220
The other interesting
correlation

00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:52.590
is how much stronger
the correlation

00:58:52.590 --> 00:58:55.320
between environmental
movement pressure and policy

00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.510
is than between
movement pressure

00:58:57.510 --> 00:59:03.480
and his measure, at least, of
changes in the environment.

00:59:03.480 --> 00:59:07.370
And part of that has to
do with where you are

00:59:07.370 --> 00:59:09.530
and what the natural
conditions are, right?

00:59:09.530 --> 00:59:13.040
Policy efforts in Los
Angeles are extraordinary.

00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:16.630
Los Angeles has dirty air.

00:59:16.630 --> 00:59:20.830
I don't think there's a European
country that takes as much pain

00:59:20.830 --> 00:59:24.310
to preserve air quality as
there is done in the Los Angeles

00:59:24.310 --> 00:59:25.040
basin.

00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.470
It's just really hard.

00:59:26.470 --> 00:59:28.450
It just doesn't ventilate.

00:59:28.450 --> 00:59:32.380
So the notion that--
and if you're highly--

00:59:32.380 --> 00:59:34.420
if it's a very
dense country, it's

00:59:34.420 --> 00:59:38.770
kind of hard to preserve species
against development and so

00:59:38.770 --> 00:59:40.190
on and so forth.

00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:41.725
So, I don't know.

00:59:41.725 --> 00:59:44.830
You believe the-- are you
persuaded by the article?

00:59:44.830 --> 00:59:46.590
Comments on it?

00:59:46.590 --> 00:59:50.410
Does that actually seem
like a plausible description

00:59:50.410 --> 00:59:53.215
of interest group, of
environmental politics?

00:59:56.390 --> 01:00:01.400
And I would notice also
that the difference--

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:05.870
the link between-- and, again,
causation is an inference.

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:08.480
Its correlation
is all we measure.

01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:12.080
The link between individual--

01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.030
between environmental
pressure and attitudes

01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:17.780
isn't that great, which
makes sense in the US, right?

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:22.170
Because the Sierra Club isn't
trying to persuade you and me.

01:00:22.170 --> 01:00:25.400
It's trying to persuade
Congress and the EPA.

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:30.920
So if it's successful
there, it wins.

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.190
Individual attitudes and
policy, not that strong either.

01:00:34.190 --> 01:00:36.690
Not that strong a correlation.

01:00:36.690 --> 01:00:42.650
So this is sort of a
picture of lobbying

01:00:42.650 --> 01:00:45.500
where the environmental movement
acts directly on policy.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:49.190
Doesn't act indirectly,
seems to me,

01:00:49.190 --> 01:00:53.240
through parades, mass marches,
demonstrations, and any

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.420
of those other mechanisms.

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.890
I think that's a
fair description

01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:59.270
of the movement now in the US.

01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:00.320
Yeah?

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:02.480
AUDIENCE: Seems to me,
seems pretty reasonable

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.720
even though it's correlation
not causation, right?

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.610
Because although one
can make the argument

01:01:07.610 --> 01:01:11.150
that interest groups [INAUDIBLE]
people would come out

01:01:11.150 --> 01:01:13.490
after certain policy is made.

01:01:13.490 --> 01:01:16.850
It seems to me that
the more logical flow

01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:19.520
would be for information--

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.130
for those groups to be
formed initially and then

01:01:22.130 --> 01:01:24.470
the policy is made.

01:01:24.470 --> 01:01:26.900
So even though he
proved only correlation,

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.070
I think that that
flow makes more sense.

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:30.320
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Oh, yeah.

01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:30.530
No.

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:31.530
It's not-- is not from--

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:37.430
in fact, it can
go the other way.

01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:41.210
Because when Reagan
basically declared war

01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:44.900
on environmental policy, the
memberships of those groups

01:01:44.900 --> 01:01:48.590
soared because
they saw a threat.

01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:52.668
And the groups sent out
mass mailings, saying, look

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:54.710
what this guy is trying
to do to the environment,

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.060
and the money flowed in.

01:01:58.890 --> 01:02:02.780
So the question of, are
they exerting pressure?

01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:05.510
Yes, but in that case, they
were exerting more pressure

01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:08.720
in a much more hostile
environment politically.

01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:11.300
So yeah.

01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:17.360
I think that the direction
is generally right.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:20.470
Any other comments?

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.688
Yeah, Charlotte?

01:02:21.688 --> 01:02:22.480
AUDIENCE: I guess--

01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:24.250
I know he had a system
for doing all this,

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.290
but it seems like you could
come up with a different system

01:02:26.290 --> 01:02:27.430
and get different results.

01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:28.602
And--

01:02:28.602 --> 01:02:31.060
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: You're
just not a natural sociologist.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:31.602
You're just--

01:02:31.602 --> 01:02:33.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
apply to this.

01:02:33.350 --> 01:02:35.890
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE:
Yeah, well--

01:02:35.890 --> 01:02:42.250
but this raises a general
problem in social science.

01:02:42.250 --> 01:02:46.090
In economics, we get
lucky because you

01:02:46.090 --> 01:02:49.720
have dollars and quantities
and tons and stuff.

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.550
This is sociology.

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:52.390
What have you got?

01:02:52.390 --> 01:02:54.010
You've got attitudes.

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:56.012
You've got some
ill-defined measures

01:02:56.012 --> 01:02:57.220
of this, that, and the other.

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:02.440
You want to say, are
environmental groups effective?

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.700
It seems to me you're stuck
doing something like this.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.710
You could do it well or poorly.

01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:11.292
I think this is pretty good.

01:03:11.292 --> 01:03:13.250
I'm still not-- I hadn't
thought about it much,

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:14.833
but it just didn't
strike me that just

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:18.070
running ordinary correlations
is quite the right way to do it.

01:03:18.070 --> 01:03:20.818
But there's no obviously
better way that comes to mind.

01:03:20.818 --> 01:03:21.360
I don't know.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:22.110
What would you do?

01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:25.030
AUDIENCE: I think I'd be more
persuaded by case studies where

01:03:25.030 --> 01:03:27.850
it did work in the case
where there was a Green Party

01:03:27.850 --> 01:03:29.267
or wasn't a Green
Party, or didn't

01:03:29.267 --> 01:03:32.350
work in that sort of case.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:35.832
I think I'd be able to
relate to that more.

01:03:35.832 --> 01:03:38.317
And I know that's not
as general as what

01:03:38.317 --> 01:03:39.317
he's trying to do here--

01:03:39.317 --> 01:03:39.760
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: Yep.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.400
AUDIENCE: --but I think that
maybe he makes it too general.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.108
Like, what's the
difference between a 0.6

01:03:44.108 --> 01:03:45.910
and a 0.7 on his little scale?

01:03:45.910 --> 01:03:47.436
That doesn't mean
anything to me.

01:03:47.436 --> 01:03:49.930
RICHARD SCHMALENSEE: No,
I'm sort of with you.

01:03:52.690 --> 01:03:57.250
I'd prefer to understand one
or two cases well than 18 cases

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.530
badly.

01:03:59.530 --> 01:04:06.190
The issue he's-- well, it's
a general problem, right?

01:04:06.190 --> 01:04:08.410
You do a case study.

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:12.010
You have a study where
n equals 1, right?

01:04:12.010 --> 01:04:14.770
You can't test the
hypothesis with n equals 1.

01:04:14.770 --> 01:04:18.280
So if you're interested in
testing a hypothesis, say,

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.470
environmental movements
operate mainly

01:04:20.470 --> 01:04:25.690
through individual attitudes,
you can't do n equals 1.

01:04:25.690 --> 01:04:29.290
You could probably do before
and after in a case study.

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:31.000
You could try it.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.090
But, of course, you can't
hold everything else constant.

01:04:34.090 --> 01:04:36.910
No, I'm sympathetic.

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:42.220
I'm not excited about
uni-dimensional measures

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:44.380
of policy efforts, right?

01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:46.308
I mean, US policy is
stronger than some

01:04:46.308 --> 01:04:48.100
of those other countries
on some dimensions

01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:49.090
and weaker on others.

01:04:52.030 --> 01:04:54.910
European tax systems
favor use of diesels.

01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:56.470
Diesels produce
small particulates.

01:04:56.470 --> 01:04:59.970
Small particulates have
terrible health effects.

01:04:59.970 --> 01:05:01.720
So are they more
environmentally conscious

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.180
than we are because
they recycle or more,

01:05:04.180 --> 01:05:05.860
or are we more
environmentally conscious

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:08.200
because we avoid diesels?

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:09.380
Very hard to do.

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:09.880
Yeah.

01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.440
No, I take the point.

01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.090
Anybody else?

01:05:16.490 --> 01:05:19.200
OK.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:23.940
We will, Wednesday, talk
about US environmental policy,

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.290
walking through the case
study and looking beyond it.

01:05:26.290 --> 01:05:28.810
So please read that.

01:05:28.810 --> 01:05:31.260
And for those of
you who came late,

01:05:31.260 --> 01:05:33.210
Monday we will
see if we can find

01:05:33.210 --> 01:05:34.830
a guest speaker for
an hour, and we'll

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:38.100
do an hour's soft shoe on--
a half an hour soft shoe

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:43.400
on green growth, reflecting
the will of a narrow majority.

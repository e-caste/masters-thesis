WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I just got the feedback from the one
minute things just a few minutes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
before class, so I think I may defer
commenting on the couple of them

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
until the beginning of next lecture.
But there are a couple of things

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
that I think I can say.
One is, several people were

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
wondering, how does the cell decide
whether to do mitosis or meiosis?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But the mitosis, which is ordinary
cell division is what happens

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
everywhere in your body,
in your intestine, on your skin,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
in your eye, anywhere except, since
that I you make all the different

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
cells you have.
The meiosis, which creates the sex

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
sells, or gametes,
happens in a very specific place,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
either in the testes if you are male
or the ovary if you are a female.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
So, there's a dedicated place where
meiosis takes place,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and just your knowledge of human
anatomy and physiology can make a

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
pretty good guess as to where that
is.  Everywhere else, it's mitosis.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
There's a very special place where
that happens.  A couple of you still

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
got confused when I was talking
about meiosis and I were showing you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
a progression through,
and I put a double headed arrow,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
meaning that's was with that period
was called.  The process is

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
unidirectional.
It only goes in one way.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
It's not a reversible process.
There were some questions about the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
chiasmata or the chiasma: why is
there a crossover in chiasma in

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
meiosis but not mitosis?
I will tell you about that today

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
very specifically.
Why was there a tall and a short

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
pair of chromosomes?
That was arbitrary.  I made up a

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
simple cell for us to consider these
properties in,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
one with a long,
and what with a short,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
nothing else.  I wasn't trying to
represent any particular organism.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And I'll pick up on a couple of
other things.  I just want to

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
quickly mention something.
Since I've seen you, I flew out to

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
San Diego, gave a talk yesterday
morning at a major meeting,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
hopped on a plane, got back at
midnight, and here and again.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
As part of being a scientist,
come teacher, at a place like MIT,

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
you guys tend not to see, but my
research life goes on

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
while I'm teaching.
And I just want to briefly mentioned

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
one thing I talked about yesterday,
because just in my own life it

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
captures a couple of things that
I've been trying to tell you,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
that the textbook is not the
ultimate authority.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
That's just what we think up until
today.  A new finding to change the

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
way you think about things,
and what I'm telling you, and some

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
of your frustrated at,
that I'm not just parroting back the

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
textbook is because this is the way
it is.  If you guys are going to be

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
leaders in whatever field you're in,
you're going to be dealing with this

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
process of shifting sands as we gain
new knowledge.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000
So, in fact what I was talking about
has some relationship to the cell

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
cycle that I talked about.
Lee Hartwell particularly helped us

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
understand that there is what's
called a G1 phase,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
which you could think of as a
preparation for DNA synthesis for

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000
what's known as the S-phase where
DNA synthesis actually occurs.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
And now, you're at 4N.  You've
doubled the DNA content,

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and there's G2 where it cleans up
from S-phase, gets ready for mitosis,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
and mitosis is what you,
then, separate the daughter

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
chromatids, go back to 2N,
and then ultimately the cell divides.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And we are back to 2N.
And what we were talking about DNA

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000
replication, I told you how
replicative DNA polymerases test for

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Watson-Crick shape,
and remember that little movie I

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
showed you where they flipped the
base pair into a very narrow slot in

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
the protein, and they check that
it's there.  And they said at that

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
time, that's why polymerases have a
problem when they hit a lesion such

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000
as a thymine dimer that we get we go
out into the sun.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And then one of the recent pieces of
excitement in the DNA repair field

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
that I work in,
was the discovery of a whole class

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.000
of translesion DNA polymerases that
are very flexible,

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
active sites and we are able to copy
over a lesion.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Right at this point,
you will find in the literature all

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
sorts of reviews about polymerase
switching, where people are

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
envisioning the replicate of
polymerase coming along.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
It hits a lesion, gets stuck.
It recruits one of these translesion

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
polymerases that comes in,
copies of the lesion; it switches

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
back to the replica of polymerase,
[and then it goes?].  And there are

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000
reviews like that coming out in the
literature.  So,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.000
one of the genes that's needed for
this sort of error prone kind of

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
translesion synthesis in yeast and
in humans is a gene called [rev-1?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
.  You don't have to notice for the
exam, this bit.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
But if you knock out the function of
that gene, the yeast aren't mutated

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
by UV or chemicals anymore.
So, you know it has an essential

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
function somehow in this process of
translesion synthesis.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So, one of our big surprises was I
was trying it.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
We were trying to actually fish out
partners that might interact with it

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
cause we thought it would be
regulated.  And we were surprised.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
The experiments revealed something
we hadn't expected.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
We found out that this protein that
was critical for mutagenesis was

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000
extremely strongly cell
cycle regulated.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Well, given the reviews I've told
you, or if somebody you're writing a

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000
textbook today,
this is what they would tell you:

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000
polymerase switching during S-phase.
So you might have thought it would

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000
be high and S-phase,
but it isn't.  We can barely detect

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
it during S-phase.
But instead, the rev-1 levels are

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
at least 50 times in the G2M phase.
Actually, it goes right through

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
this part of the cell cycle,
50 times what they are during

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000
S-phase.
And so, there's a couple of

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000
possibilities right now.
Either these very tiny amounts that

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
are doing S-phase are what everybody
thinks and current models would

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
predict: you're getting polymerase
switching.  And it makes 50 fold

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
more during this phase for something
else.  If so, I don't know what that

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000
is.  The other possibility is that
we have to rethink our model,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
and that it isn't polymerase
switching during replication.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Actually, the replication for it
just keeps moving,

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000
and it leaves behind little masses.
And when the cell is busy starting

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
to line up as chromosomes,
and even while it's pulling them

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000
apart, that's when this translesion
synthesis stuff comes in,

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000
and it cleans up the damage.
Now, I don't know what the right

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000
answer is.  That was one of the
things I was talking about yesterday

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
morning.  But it's an example of how
something that you guys can now

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
hopefully at least understand in
principle is being debated

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000
right now.
And the finding from my lab changed

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000
the way I'd been thinking about it
at least.  I can now see another

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
very real possibility.
So, just to move on, so we are

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
going back to Mendel now,
who did an awful lot more than I

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
told you.  A few of you thought it
was pretty frustrating and it had

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000
all that.  But Mendel was doing
other things.  You already know what

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000
he could do.  He knew how to do
crosses.  He knew how to count.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
And he could think, which was
really important.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:37.000
And he's our ratios instead of just
numbers.  So it was another class of

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000
experiment that he could do,
and that was he could do a cross

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000
where he looked at more than one
trait at once.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000
And he didn't have all that many
options for things he could do,

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000
but he did what are known as
dihybrid crosses,

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000
where he followed two traits at once.
And I showed you some of the traits

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
that he studied.
In fact, that picture I showed you

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
is actually a cross that we can
think of right now.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
He's got smooth, and yellow,
wrinkled, and green, and yellow,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000
and you'll see them in all four
combinations.  So,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
an example of the kind of crust that
Mendel carried out,

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000
then, was he took smooth yellow,
which actually is the dominant

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000
allele, and [both?
, which he learned from his other

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
crosses.
And he crossed it with wrinkled

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000
green, which I'll represent as a
little s, little s,

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000
little y, little y,  where he
previously known the little s and

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:04.000
little y alleles,
the wrinkled and green were the

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000
recessive alleles.
And then, the F1 generation,

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
wouldn't be surprising to you at
this point, I think,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
that they were all smooth,
yellow.  And, they all were ss yy.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:22.000
And if you think about the possible
gametes you get out of this,

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000
you could only get a big S, big Y
out of this one,

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000
and little s, little y out of that
one.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:39.000
So if they came together,
it would have to be that.  So then,

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:48.000
what he did the self crossed the F1,
and what he got out of that was the

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:57.000
kind of mixture of things
that he saw there.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.000
He saw smooth yellow,
smooth green, wrinkled yellow,

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:13.000
and wrinkled green.  In doing the
same kind of experiments that we

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:21.000
talked about before,
he counted them, he looked to see if

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:30.000
he saw characteristic
ratios.  He did.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000
The ratios he saw were 9:3:3:1.
So, I think we know how his head

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:42.000
worked at this point.
He was try to figure out if he

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000
could explain these results by the
kind of model that he was developing

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000
where hereditary information came in,
in particles.  And he could.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:11:02.000
But he had to make a critical
assumption.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000
And if you've just seen the next
square going to draw,

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:17.000
without realizing the assumption
underlies it, then you've missed a

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000
great deal of his thinking.
And that was that the two genes of

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.000
sort, or the two traits anyway,
because he didn't know they were

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000
genes yet independently.
And the way we could see that would

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:46.000
be to think about what were the kind
of gametes that you could make from

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:54.000
those F1s.  So,
we could get a big S and a big Y

00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:01.000
from here, or a big S and a little y,
or a little s and a big Y,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
or a little s and a little y.
And, since this is [selfing?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:16.000
, it's the same thing.  So I won't
fill this whole thing in,

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000
but we get two S's, two big Y's here.
Down here we'd have little s,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:31.000
little y like that.  I'll fill in a
couple up here where we've got big S,

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.000
big S, big Y, and a little Y.
Here we have big S,

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000
big S, but two little Y's.
Here we'd have big S, little s,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.000
big Y little y.  And over here we'd
have big S, little S,

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:52.000
two little y's.  So, if you were to
make out [then?

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.000
a table or a chart like this that
showed the phenotypes,

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.000
you'll find that all of these wild
type, we can see it here.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
However, this one would be smooth.
But it's got the two alleles.  So

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:12.000
it would be green.
This one would be smooth and yellow.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:17.000
And this, again,
would be smooth but green.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000
And down on the corner it is the
wrinkled green.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000
And if you follow that out,
draw out the rest of that, you'll

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000
discover there the 9:3:3:1 ratios.
That was what Mendel observed in

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000
all of his experiments.
But he was particularly bothered by

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000
it because he'd shown particular
information.  The fact [they sorted?

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
randomly wasn't an issue.  However,
that was before people knew about

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000
the chromosomes,
which we spent quite a bit of time

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
talking about the other day.
As I said, when people saw those

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:06.000
chromosomes that gave rise to what's
known as the chromosomal

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
theory of inheritance.
And what was interesting about

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
chromosomal theory of inheritance
was that it predicted a different

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
outcome depending on whether the
traits you were studying were

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
encoded by genes on the same
chromosome or by genes on different

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.000
chromosomes.  Now,
as it happened, what I think Mendel

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
did was he found traits that were
well behaved and he could study.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:40.000
And those all happened to be on
separate chromosomes.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.000
So, his results didn't disclose
this issue that was raised by the

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:50.000
discovery of chromosomes.
The chromosomal theory of

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000
inheritance gives,
as I said, predicts different

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
outcomes depending whether things
are on the same or different

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000
chromosomes.
So let's consider that by taking the

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:16.000
F1.  So, say they are on separate
chromosomes.  And let's take the F1

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:25.000
from the previous cross over here.
So, big S., little s, big Y, little

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:34.000
y, and then we'll cross it with the
homozygous recessive parent.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.000
That was a cross that I mentioned
the first lecture was very important.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:42.000
It's important enough that it's
given a special name.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000
It's called a test across.
Well, here we are using it here.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Well what are the possible outcomes
that could come from this sort of

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.000
thing?  Well, I think the way you
could think about it most easily is,

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:00.000
what kind of gametes or sex cells
could we get out of this?

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Well, from here we could get a big S
and a big Y.  Or,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
we could get a big S.
and the little y, a little S and a

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
big Y, or a little S and a little y.
So, we could get four different

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:21.000
types of sex cells.
The gametes we can get out of this

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:26.000
sign, there's only one type.
So, if we start combining those,

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.000
I think you can see what the outcome
would be.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000
It's so simple.
We don't even need to draw out the

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
square.  If we had big S,
big Y over, they're all going to be

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
over.  Well actually,
I'll draw up this way because I

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
think it's a little easier to see.
So, there would be four possible

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:02.000
things that would come out
of this test cross.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:06.000
This would be the smooth and yellow.
Here would be, what have I done

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.000
wrong here?  No,
this is right.  This should be

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000
smooth and green.
This would be wrinkled and yellow.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
And this would be wrinkled and
green.  And, do you see what the

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000
ratio would be?
It would be 1:1:1:1 because we have

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000
an equal probability of
making any of those.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000
And, I'm going to rearrange these
because the way that it'll help us

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.000
think about it,
this is one of the types that we've

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000
found in the original cross.
That's a parental phenotype,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000
smooth and yellow.  It was one of
the parents up there.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000
This is the other one that looks
like one of the original parents.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So, I can divide these into
parental or nonparental phenotypes.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:09.000
These are 1:1,
and then these others were ones

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:16.000
where the progeny differed from the
parent.  And they're all 1:1:1:1.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Now, that's what the chromosomal
theory of inheritance would predict

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000
if they were on separate chromosomes.
That's what Mendel saw when he was

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:36.000
doing his crosses.
What if they were on the same

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:44.000
chromosome?  So,
we are going to have to go back to

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:52.000
the original cross now to think this
one through.  So,

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.000
what Mendel started with was a
smooth, yellow parent.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
So that was SYSY.
But because these are on the same

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000
chromosome, I'm going to depict them
this way so we can see they're going

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000
to travel as a unit.
So that was then crossed with the

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:20.000
wrinkled green,
which would be a little s,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
little y.  In each case,
[UNINTELLIGIBLE] should be F1 in

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
this case will be all
smooth and yellow.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
The recessive traits disappear,
but this time they're only, what the

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000
progeny will have,
they will have gotten one of the

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000
possible alleles from this one,
which would be the SY on the same

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
chromosome, and one from the other
parent, the little s,

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000
little y again on the same
chromosome and one from the other

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000
parent, the little s and y,
again, on the same chromosome.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000
So now if you start to ask, what
will happen if I do a test cross,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
you're going to get a different
outcome.  So here's the test

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000
cross in this case.
So, we've got this F1.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
It's smooth and yellow,
but it's actually at the chromosomal

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
level now.  It's like this,
and we're crossing it with the

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000
homozygous recessive parent that's
now going to look like that.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000
So if you think through, what kind
of gametes could we get out of this?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Well, there's only two
possibilities.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000
We could get this one or this one.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And over here,
the kind of gametes we could get,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:43.000
there's only one type.  So, what are
we going to get out of this cross?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:50.000
What we'll end up getting is big SY,
over the little sy,

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:57.000
or little sy over the little sy like
that.  That's smooth and yellow,

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.000
wrinkled and green, the ratio of
these 1:1.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
But you see the difference from what
we saw before?

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
These are the parental phenotypes.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:22.000
The chromosomal theory of

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.000
inheritance doesn't predict that you
will get, or it predicts that you

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
will not get the nonparental
phenotypes.  So,

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000
if you wanted to distinguish between
these two hypotheses,

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:38.000
and figure out where your genes were,
you'd do the experiment.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
And what happened when this was
done, again, what often happens in

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000
science, you think you've got it
straightened out.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000
You got hypothesis A and hypothesis
B, and you do experiment planning to

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:54.000
do the scientific method and show it.
And you get a result that isn't

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.000
what you expected with either model.
And that's in fact what happened in

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
this case.
And it led to the discovery of

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:07.000
genetic recombination.
And to show you actually the

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000
experiments where that was
discovered, I'm going to switch to

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000
another widely used genetic model,
which is the Drosophila melanogaster,

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000
or the fruit fly,
which you see in the summer around

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000
rotting fruit.
Or if you're in the biology

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000
building, one is apt to land on your
sandwich because there's just a few

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000
stragglers that get out of the
Drosophila genetics labs.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000
But the one thing you can see from
this is the eyes,

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
pretty cool.  It's got red.
The wild type is a red eye,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.000
and the body's brown.  And, you can
see the red eyes.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000
If you look at a fruit fly
carefully, you'll be able to see,

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
the summer if you take a look,
you'll see that they have red eyes.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
So, they've been a very useful
model organism for genetics partly

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000
because they grow pretty fast and
they are easy to handle in a lab.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:09.000
And so, I'll introduce you to a
couple of features.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000
So, the wild type you find in
nature is a brown body.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:23.000
We'll call it a plus, and it has
normal wings, and which I'll refer

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:30.000
to as plus.  And some mutant
phenotypes that geneticists have

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:37.000
been able to find is a black body
which I'll refer to as little b.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And vestigial wings,
which I'll refer to as VG.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.000
So, these are fairly easy to score.
They look like little tiny wings.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
It's fairly easy if you're crossing
Drosophila, and that looking at

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000
progeny to go through and score,
what color are their eyes?  And do

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
they have ordinary wings
or little wings?

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.000
So, this is the kind of cross that
was carried out.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
We are going to switch now to an
organism that has male and female.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Up until now, plants are both.
They make pollen,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
and they have the eggs that are
going to develop into the seeds once

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
they're fertilized.
But, Drosophila are more like us.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:28.000
They come in males and females.  So,
we're going to have to specify which

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:32.000
is which.  And I think most of you
are probably familiar with

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.000
this terminology.
This is the symbol geneticists use

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
for female.  And this is the one
that is used for male.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:46.000
So, in this case, let's set up
exactly the same kind of thing that

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000
we start here.
We're going to cross a homozygous

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000
parent versus a homozygous recessive
parent.  That's just exactly the

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
kind of thing we have up here.
But I'm going to do at this time

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.000
using Drosophila genetics speak.
And so, we'll be taking female whose

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:10.000
wild type for both traits,
we're going to cross with a male

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
that's homozygous recessive for both
traits.  This is the way Drosophila

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:21.000
geneticists tend to represent this
kind of thing.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
So it's exactly the same kind of
cross we got before.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.000
And at this point, what we get out
of the F1, it shouldn't

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:36.000
be news for you.
You can see genetically what it's

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
going to be.  They'll have to get
one allele from here,

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000
one allele from there.
So, by definition, the only

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:50.000
possibility that you can get out of
this, the F1s,

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
will all have one allele dominant,
and one recessive allele just like

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.000
up there.  And this will be,
since the wild type is the dominant

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.000
allele, this will be brown and
normal, and normal wings.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:12.000
And then, at this point they then
will set up a test cross,

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:19.000
exactly the same idea.  We're going
to take the F1.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:26.000
And in this case,
we'll take a female whose got this,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:34.000
and we'll cross her with a male who
is homozygous recessive.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:40.000
So that will be black over black,
and vestigial over vestigial.  And

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:47.000
out of this, there are four
possibilities.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:54.000
We can get parental phenotypes.
So, there will be, from that, black

00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:00.000
over, if you look to the various
combinations of how these things

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000
could go together,
you'll find we can get vestigial

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000
plus.
Or, we can get black over black,

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000
and vestigial over vestigial.  For
example, this one,

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000
coming from those two getting
together, and this one coming from

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:25.000
this one and this one getting
together.  So this is just exactly

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.000
the same kind of thing we've done
but done using Drosophila traits.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:38.000
And then, nonparental,
so now we get, for example,

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:46.000
black over black, and vestigial over
plus, black but normal wings,

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:54.000
or we could have black over plus,
vestigial over vestigial, which

00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:02.000
would be a brown body,
but with vestigial wings.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
So, if we were trying to do this
kind of cross,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000
we are doing this kind of cross,
and we are trying to see what the

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:15.000
outcome would be,
Mendel, every trait [assorts?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:20.000
independently would predict the
1:1:1:1.  And the chromosomal theory

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
of inheritance would predict we'd
get 1:1 here, and we wouldn't see

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:29.000
those at all.  Instead,
what happened when this experiment

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
was done where numbers that
didn't really fit.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.000
This part works pretty well.
These are numbers from an

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:45.000
experiment of this type.
So these are pretty close to 1:1.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
That's OK.  That fits with both of
the models.  The surprise is over

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:56.000
here where there is [2/6 to 185?
.  So, these are in the ballpark of

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
1:1.  But what you can see is the
result is not what was predicted

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000
by the model.
This is the kind of thing I've sort

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
of been trying to tell you through
the course.  It keeps happening in

00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000
biology.  It's not a QED sort of
thing where you can work it out by

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
logic.  Very often,
you do an experiment,

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
you get a result that doesn't fit
within your current framework.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And then you have to go back and
redo your thinking.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000
So what was going on here,
as it turned out, and it all got

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
sorted out, was scientists had just
discovered genetic recombination.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:40.000
And here is where,
what was going on.  So when we

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:50.000
talked about Meiosis I,
and we had duplicated the DNA,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:30:00.000
so we now had to chromatids, and I
showed you the chiasma when it was

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:11.000
drying, it looked sort
of like this.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000
And, I said that you always sought
these physical attachments that once

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000
the homologous pairs were duplicated,
they would always be in contact.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And I said there was actually a
physical interaction going on there.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Well what was going on in there was
an exchange, a recombination event

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
at the DNA level that's just exactly
equivalent to what was happening

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000
when I showed you the
phage cross.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Remember, we had a phage cross,
and if we got a recombination in

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:47.000
between the two genes,
then we could get progeny that were

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000
a mixture of the two traits.
So, if we were plus plus, for

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:59.000
example, these are on the same
chromosome.  And the other one is

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:06.000
like this, black,
vestigial, black, and vestigial.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
If we get a genetic recombination
going on here where these two

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
intersect and recombine in between
these two genes,

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:20.000
what you get out of that,
then, is this chromatid is still the

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
same.  It's got both wild type
alleles.  But in this case,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:29.000
now, the black allele has moved from
here to the tip of this one,

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
pairing it with that.
And the other chromatid over here,

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
the other homologous pair, now has
the plus together with the vestigial

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000
here and then here.
So, if you, then, draw out the

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
possible gametes one will look like
one parent.  One will look like the

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:55.000
other parent.  This one can give
rise to a nonparental phenotype in a

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
test cross.  And that one can give
rise to a nonparental phenotype

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:07.000
and a test cross.
And that's what's going on in this

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:14.000
experiment I've described.
But the nice thing about this since

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:22.000
this sort of thing is happening is
one can calculate,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:29.000
then, a recombination frequency in
just the same way that we calculated

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:36.000
it when we were doing phage cross.
And in this case,

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:44.000
it was the recombinants,
which in this context I'm referring

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:52.000
to the nonparentals,
the recombinants over the total of

00:32:52.000 --> 00:33:00.000
the parental types and
the nonparental.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
So in this case,
this would be 206 plus 185 over 965

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:11.000
plus 944 plus 206 plus 185.
And if I haven't blown the

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
arithmetic, that would be a
recombination frequency of 17%.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:22.000
Now, we were back talking about
that phage cross.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000
Remember, we did a pair of crosses
between gene one and two,

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:33.000
and between two and three,
and then we were trying to figure

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.000
out if they were in the linear order,
how we could explain it.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:43.000
And we finally worked out the order
by crossing allele one and three.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
And we made a little genetic map
that could show the order of gene 1,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000
2, and 3, based on nothing more than
the recombination frequency.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
So, that's exactly what people were
able to do by this kind

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
of measurement.
And that, then,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
led to the generation of chromosome
maps.  This is a publication from

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Science in 1994.
This is before the human genome was

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000
done.  And they were mapping a kind
of genetic marker that we'll talk

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000
about [when?] we do restriction
enzymes.  But they were able to

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:26.000
associate it with [banning?
patterns they had seen on the

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.000
chromosome.
This is the sort of thing that

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
cytologists saw,
and as scientists were working this

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
out, then they were able to
associate these genetic maps of loci,

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:46.000
and begin to associate them with the
physical maps of banning patterns

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000
[in?] chromosomes.
Now we have the sort of ultimate

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:56.000
genetic map, which is the sequence
of the human chromosomes.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:01.000
So now we know exactly, to the base
pair, how far different genes are.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Part of the way that the human
genome was assembled from all these

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
little tiny fragments of DNA that
were sequenced were taking advantage

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
of these kind of maps that told the
scientists assembling all these

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
little fragments of DNA sequence
what order they had to be in,

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:21.000
what part of the chromosome they
were on, and that kind of thing.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000
There is, this, then, leads us,
though, to other issues since I've

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:29.000
now started to talk about
chromosomes.  And one more thing,

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:33.000
let me just say before I leave this.
So, from this kind of thing,

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:39.000
if the recombination frequency is
much less than 50%,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:45.000
then they're on the same chromosome.
And the word geneticists use to

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:51.000
describe  this is they say genes are
linked.  If the recombination

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:57.000
frequency is 50%,
then they are on different

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
chromosomes.
At this point,

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
it's just random assortment.
[You go?] one way or the other [as

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
you get?] a number of 50% if you do
this kind of calculation.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000
And these are referred to as
unlinked.  And those of you who are

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
thinking about it can probably
imagine that there might be a

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
problem, that if you had a very long
chromosome, so the two genes you are

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
studying were very far apart,
you might get so many recombination

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
events in between that it would
begin to look,

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
the recombination frequency might
come close to 50%.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
And you would perhaps have a
difficult time in that genetic cross

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
telling whether the genes are really
unlinked.  They were on separate

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
chromosomes, or they were linked but
very far apart.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:50.000
So this kind of thing could be a
little hard to resolve that kind of

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
situation.  But there are other
things you can do to look at that.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
So, the chromosomes we've been
talking about are what are

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000
known as autosomes.
These are identical pairs.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:10.000
But there's an exception.  And
those are the genes that are

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
involved in sex determination.
It's the chromosomes that are

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:22.000
involved in sex determination.
These are known as heterozomes.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000
And, they're on this picture that I
showed you where they used this

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:34.000
technique of chromosome
painting to show it.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:40.000
You can see how all these autosomes
are in identical pairs.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:46.000
But this is a male, obviously,
because there's the Y-chromosome,

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000
and there is an X.  If you're a
female, you'd have two copies of the

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000
X, something I think most of you
know.  So, if we think about how

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:04.000
this works in humans,
females have two X's, and males have

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:10.000
an X and a Y.
In Drosophila,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.000
the fruit fly, it's the same thing.
Males have two X.  Females have two

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.000
X's, and males have an XY.
But there isn't anything magic in

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000
nature about females having two of
the same, and males having one of

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000
each because in birds where it's
different enough they use

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000
different notation.
The females have one of each.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:44.000
And let me make sure I got my
notation right.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:50.000
I think it's ZZ,
excuse me.  And the females have one

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:56.000
of each.  So, nature tends to use
these differences as far

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:01.000
as sex determination.
And this, then,

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:06.000
poses a new kind of problem.
And that is, what would happen if

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:10.000
you were doing a cross,
and the allele that you are studying

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:15.000
happened to be a sex chromosome
instead of one of these?

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:20.000
You might guess that since females
have two of one and males have one

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
of each that I would not give the
results that are predicted by what

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
we've talked about so far.
And so, this led to the discovery

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.000
of what's known as sex linkage.
And that's important.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:41.000
And in fact, as you'll see in a
minute, affects stuff that we are

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000
familiar with in our lives.
I want to just quickly introduce

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:53.000
you to this, and show you how it was
discovered.  It was done by Thomas

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Morgan in 1910 actually,
this discovery.  What he was doing

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
was he took a white eyed male,
crossed it with a red eyed female

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
wild type, and yet the expected
result that the F1s

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:18.000
were all red eye.
But then when he took the F1 female,

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:25.000
which was red, and crossed it with a
red eyed male,

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:32.000
you got something that was very
puzzling at the time.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.000
The females were all red.
The males, half of them had red

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
eyes, and half of them had white
eyes.  If you followed the logic up

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:47.000
until now, where you try to work
this out, you would find that you

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000
couldn't generate this pattern by
the stuff that we've talked about

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.000
now.  So once again,
this led to the need to create a new

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:03.000
model, something that expanded
our thinking.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000
So, the way the thinking went was,
well, there must be something to do

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000
with the sex of the fruit fly in
this.  And so,

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000
here was the hypothesis,
and that was that the white eyed

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:20.000
male had this genotype.
They had an allele that caused the

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
white eyeness.
But it was located on the X

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:28.000
chromosome so that the male would
have had a Y chromosome

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:34.000
paired with that.
And, the red eyed female used in the

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000
first cross would have a wild type
allele on both X chromosomes.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:46.000
And so, if that were the model,
what's going to happen to them when

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:53.000
we do this cross that we've
described here?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:59.000
Well, let's think it through.
So, we've got female whose X plus.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:09.000
We're crossing with the male who's

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:21.000
got the X with the white allele over
the Y.  So, the females can either

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:34.000
be, they'll get an X plus XW,
and the males, yeah, right.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:40.000
The males are going to get,
they will get this allele for Y.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:46.000
So now, if he takes us red eyed
female, that was the F1 from the

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:52.000
cross up here,
which will be this,

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.000
and crossed with a red eyed male.
Now, that means the male has to

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:05.000
have the good allele.
What are we going to get?

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Well, for the females in this cross,
we've got a couple of possibilities.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:17.000
This one, we could get just the
wild type female back,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:23.000
or we could get this one pairing
with this one,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:30.000
which will give us this.
So, these are all red that fit.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000
But, the males,
then, if you see what happens,

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000
they have to have, each have to have
a Y, and then they can either get

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
this allele or that allele.
If they get this allele, they're

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
red.  If this allele,
they're white.  If you stand back

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000
and look at that,
you will see that is the outcome

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000
that was observed.
Females were all red.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
The males are half red,
half white.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Well, this is a characteristic of,
this would be an X-linked trait.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.000
And I want to just point out one
thing.  This female,

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000
excuse me, wrong female.
This female here is what's referred

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:24.000
to as a carrier.
She's got this allele that causes a

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:30.000
white guy, but she's not expressing
it herself.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000
But she's able to transmit it to her
sons.  And when she has progeny,

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:39.000
on average, half of her sons will
have the trait.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000
And now, X-linked traits,
there are a number of them that we

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000
know about.  Some of you may know
hemophilia.  Queen Victoria was a

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:53.000
carrier of this gene causing
hemophilia, where there is a problem

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.000
with the clotting mechanism.
And if you get a cut, then you can

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000
bleed a lot.
So, some of her sons had this.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:06.000
A more common one, which has to
apply to some people in this room,

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:10.000
is red-green color blindness.  If
you're a male,

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:15.000
you have a much higher probability
of being colorblind because it's an

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
X-linked trait.
And I want to just close by showing

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
you how human geneticists think
about the sort of thing.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:28.000
And we have to think about things
differently if we are doing human

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000
genetics because as most of you know,
I think all of us would be very

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:37.000
uncooperative subjects in a kind of
genetic cross that a fruit fly

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
geneticist [or most?
geneticists would like to have us

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
do, in which we'd be put in a cage
with a member of the other

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:49.000
sex and say, mate.
That was your choice in life.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Well, that would be a different
kind of existence for us all.

00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:56.000
So, human geneticists don't have
that luxury of having pure breeding

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
strains and doing controlled
crosses.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
We all have very strong feelings
about the kind of crosses that we

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:08.000
want to engage in.
And so, what they have to do,

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
they have to make use with what they
find.  And they use a couple of

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
symbols here that I'll just show you.
They look at pedigrees,

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
and then they look for patterns.
And, they use a little shorthand

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
for doing this.
Males are squares,

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
which I don't know if there's any
symbolism to that or not,

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
but if they are affected they show
it as a shaded square,

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:38.000
and unaffected as an open symbol.
So, affected males are solid squares.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Affected females are solid circles.
So, let's take a look at the sort

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.000
of pedigree that human geneticists
might see.  And let's consider

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:52.000
something.  Let's consider red-green
color blindness,

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
which is an X-linked trait.
So, let's take a male, which there

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:02.000
is probably one in this room at
least, maybe more, who have this.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.000
So, since the colorblindness trait
is on the X chromosome since he's a

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:10.000
male, the other pair will be Y.
That means if you're a male and

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.000
you've got it,
you're going to display the

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:18.000
phenotypes.  So this is,
George, let's say, who is colorblind.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.000
They leave a lot of the romance out
of these things,

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:26.000
as you'll see, who had progeny with
Mary.  Let's say,

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
they got married after they
graduated from MIT.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:35.000
It was very happy.
They had a, let's see,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:41.000
son.  He had to get the Y from dad.
So, he had to get a good allele

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:48.000
from his mother.
But they also had a daughter,

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:55.000
and she had to get the color
blindness allele on an X chromosome

00:47:55.000 --> 00:48:02.000
because the dad only had one of them,
and then a good one from her mom.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:08.000
So at this point,
everybody's normal.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:15.000
But you'll notice, this daughter
has this trait of being a carrier

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:21.000
because even though she doesn't
display the trait herself,

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:28.000
she's got it in her genome.
So, let's say, [UNINTELLIGIBLE

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:35.000
PHRASE], a woman who doesn't have
any colorblindness allele.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000
So, if we have,
let's say, a daughter,

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
and a son, a daughter, and a son,
this is not much happening over on

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:48.000
the part of the pedigree.
Everybody would be normal.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:52.000
Yeah, did I miss something?
Pardon?  Oh, it's over Y.  Excuse

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:57.000
me, yep, I'm going too fast here.
Over Y, here we go.  I don't need

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:01.000
to introduce any genetic
abnormalities on top of what we're

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000
already trying to do here.
This is complicated enough.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
OK, so what happens,
let's say then that the daughter

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.000
that married a guy,
and they had four children.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:18.000
I'm going to help us with the
genetics of it,

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
from the geneticist,
that sort of a perfect family in

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
this case would be four kids
representing all four possibilities.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
And so, first off let's think what
would happen with the daughters.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Well, the daughters could either
have the colorblindness allele

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:45.000
paired with this one.
Or, they could get a wild type

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:52.000
allele with this one.
So actually, I'd better put this in.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:50:00.000
So this is a daughter.
So this would be [CB?] over plus,

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:06.000
or it could be plus over plus.
This one would,

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:12.000
again, be a carrier.
Now, with the sons, they're both

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:18.000
going to get the Y since they're
male.  But there's a possibility of

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:24.000
either getting the good allele,
which means he'll be unaffected.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:30.000
But, if you get the other one,
he'll be affected.

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Now, this would be sort of a typical
pedigree.  And you realize,

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
depending on the number of kids,
you might or might not see this.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
But this, you're going to get to do
some more of these and to do some

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000
other traits.  But let me just sort
of point out, if you're a human

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
geneticist, what you would recognize
here, the trait's more frequent in

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000
males.  The frequency of color
blindness is about 8% on the X

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000
chromosome.  So,
if you're a female,

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
you've got to have two of them.
So that means, you've got 0.64%

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000
because you've got to get two
together.  It's a much smaller

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:01.000
probability.  The trait skips a
generation, [you'd often say?].

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
You see it here.
You see here. But you don't see it

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000
in between, and that's because you
have this carrier.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
The affected males don't transmit
to their sons because what they give

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000
to their sons is the Y.
So, they [kept giving?] the

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
colorblindness thing.
And then, the heterozygous females

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:22.000
who are carriers will transmit the
trait to their sons about half the

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
time.  And that's a pattern that a
human geneticist would look for.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:29.000
And they'd say, ah-ha, it must be
an X-linked trait.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000
And you'll see in your problem sets
and [recitation?

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000
sections are the patterns.
OK, I'll see you on Friday.

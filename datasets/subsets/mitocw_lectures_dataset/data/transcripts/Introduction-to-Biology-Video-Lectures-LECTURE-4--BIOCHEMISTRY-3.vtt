00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Among the issues that some people
asked that should be discussed in

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
greater detail should be
the structure of proteins.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I'll touch on it very briefly this
morning, different kinds of bonding,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
tertiary and quaternary structure,
condensation or dehydration

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
reactions. And, in fact,
many of those issues should

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
be addressed in the
recitation sections.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That's the ideal place to begin to
clarify things which although they

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
were mentioned here may not have
been mentioned in the degree of

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
detail that you really need
to assimilate them properly.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And I urge you to raise these
issues with the recitation section

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
instructors. That's exactly
what they're there for.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Having said that I just want to dip
back briefly into protein structure,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
even though we turned our back
on it at the end of last time,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
just to reinforce some things that
I realized I should have mentioned

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
perhaps in greater detail. Here
for the example are different

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
ways of depicting the
three-dimensional structure of the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
protein. And, by the
way, we see that these are

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
beta pleated sheets in the light
brown and these are alpha helices.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
There are two of them here
in green, one going this way,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
the other going this way,
a third one going this way.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
And the other blue areas
are not structured, i.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
., they're not structured in the
sense that they are in any way

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
obviously alpha helices
or beta pleated sheets.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Here's a space-filling model,
a space-filling depiction of a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
protein. We talked about that
last time. Here is a trace of the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
backbone, of the peptide backbone
of the same protein where the side

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
chains are left out, and
obviously where one is only

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
plotting the three-dimensional
coordinates of each of the backbone

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
atoms, CCN, CCN, CCN.
Here is yet another way of

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
plotting exactly the same
protein in terms of indicating,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
as we just said, the structure
of these alpha helices in

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
the other regions. That is
the secondary structure of

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
this protein. And here's
yet a fourth way of plotting,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
of depicting the same structure
of the protein where roughly one is

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
depicting the configuration of
the amino acids in terms of a large

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
sausage. Excuse me. If one
were to use a space-filling

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
model we'd go up to here. So
these are just four ways of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
looking at the same protein with
different degrees of simplification.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Another point that I thought I would
like to reinforce and make was the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
following. We've talked about
transmembrane proteins in the past.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
That is, proteins which protrude
through a membrane from one side to

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000
the other. And a point that I
realized I'd like to make is that if

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
we look at a transmembrane protein
here's one that is starting out in

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000
the cytoplasm of a cell. And,
by the way, the soluble part

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000
of the cytoplasm is
sometimes called the cytosol.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Here is the lipid bilayer that we
talked about at length and here is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
the extracellular domain
of this same protein. Now,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
how is all this organized? Well,
the fact of the matter is we

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
discussed the fact that this
hydrophobic space in the lipid

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
bilayer is so hydrophobic that it
really doesn't like to be in the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
presence of hydrophilic molecules,
including in this case amino acids.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And what we see here is the fact
that almost all of the amino acids

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
in this region of the protein,
which is called the transmembrane

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
region of the protein because it
reaches from one side to the other,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
are all hydrophobic or neutral
amino acids which are reasonably

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
comfortable in the hydrophobic
space of the lipid bilayer.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
There happens to be two
apparent violators of this,

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
glutamine and histidine. You
see these two here? I mean

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
glutamic acid and histidine.
Glutamic acid and histidine.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
One is negatively charged and
therefore is highly hydrophilic.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The other is positively charged
and is therefore highly hydrophilic.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
And on the surface that would
seem to violate the rule I just

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
articulated. But the fact is that
as it turns out in the particular

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
protein these two charges, these
two amino acids are so closely

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
juxtaposed with one another that
their positive and negative charges

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000
are used to neutralize one another.
And as a consequence in effect

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.000
there is no strong charging
or polarity in this area

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.000
or in this area. The take-home
lesson is that somehow

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
proteins manage to insert themselves
and to remain stable in the lipid

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
bilayer by virtue of either using
only stretches of hydrophobic or

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000
nonpolar amino acids or they use
tricks like this of neutralizing any

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
charges that happen to be there.
Note, by the way, that because

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
there are hydrophilic amino acids
down here and there turn out to be

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
hydrophilic amino acid around here,
arginine, and here there's a whole

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000
bunch of basic amino acids.
Note that this keeps the

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
transmembrane protein from getting
pulled in one direction or the other

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000
because this arginine likes
to associate with the negative

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000
phosphates on the outside
of the phospholipids.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
And the same thing is here.
And all that means is that this

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
transmembrane protein is firmly
anchored in the lipid bilayer,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
a point we'll talk about later in
greater detail when we talk about

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
membrane structure. One other
little point I'll mention

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
here in passing, which we'll
also get into in greater

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
detail, is that once a protein has
been polymerized that polymerization

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
is not the last thing that happens
to it once it's polymerized and

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000
folded into place because we know
that proteins undergo what is called

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.000
post-translational modifications.
And, as we'll talk about in the

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
coming weeks, the process
of synthesizing a protein

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
is called translation.
And when we talk about

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000
post-translational modification what
we're talking about is opening our

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000
eyes to the possibility that
even after the primary amino acid

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000
sequence has been polymerized there
are chemical alterations that can

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000
subsequently be imposed on the amino
acid side chains to further modify

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000
the protein. One such modification,
by example, is a proteolytic

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000
degradation. And when I talk
about proteolytic degradation,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000
I'm talking about the fact that
one can break down a protein.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Proteolysis is the breaking down
of a protein. And when we talk about

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
degradation we're talking about
destroying what has been synthesized.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
In the case of many proteins,
once they're synthesized there may

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
be a stretch of amino acids at one
end or the other that simply clipped

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000
off therefore creating a protein
which is smaller than the initially

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
synthesized product of
protein synthesis, i.e.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
the initially synthesized
product of translation.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Here we see yet another kind of
post-translational modification,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000
because it turns out that in many
proteins which protrude into the

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000
extracellular space there is
yet another kind of covalent

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
modification which is the process
of glycosylation in which a series of

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000
sugar side chains,
carbohydrate side chains is

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000
covalently attached to the
polypeptide chain usually on serines

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000
or threonines using the hydroxyl
of the side chain of serines or

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000
threonines to attach these
oligosaccharide side chains.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000
We know from our discussion the
last time oligosaccharide means an

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000
assembly of a small
number of monosaccharides.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000
And each of these blue hexagons
represents a monosaccharide which

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000
are covalently linked and also
modify the extracellular domain of

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000
this protein as it protrudes
into the extracellular space.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So I'm just opening our eyes to the
possibility that in the future we're

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:15.000
going to talk about yet other ways
in which proteins are modified to

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:20.000
further tune-up their structure
to make them more suitable,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
more competent to do the various
jobs to which they've been assigned.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Let's therefore return to what
we talked about the last time,

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
the fact that the structure
of nucleic acids is based on

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000
this simple principle.
Here, by the way,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I'm returning to the notion
of this numbering system.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
We're talking about a pentose
nucleic acid. The fact that there

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
are two hydroxyls here right away
tells us that we're looking at a

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
ribose rather than a deoxyribose
which, as I said last time,

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
lacks this sugar right there.
Note, as we've said repeatedly,

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000
that the hydroxyl side chains
of carbohydrates offer numerous

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000
opportunities for using dehydration
reactions, or as they're sometimes

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000
called condensation reactions
where you remove a water,

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000
where you take out a water,
dehydration, or we can call them

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000
condensation reactions to
attach yet other things. And,

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:30.000
in fact, in principle there are
actually four different hydroxyls

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
that could be used here to
do that. There's one here,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
there's one here, one here and
one here. There are four different

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
hydroxyls. The 1, the 2,
the 3 and the 5 hydroxyl are,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
in principle, opportunities
for further modification.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000
In truth the 2-prime hydroxyl
is rarely used, as we'll discuss

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000
shortly, but the main actors are
therefore this hydroxyl here in

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000
which a condensation reaction
has created a glycosidic bond.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000
That is a bond between a
sugar and a non-sugar entity.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Glyco refers obviously to sugars
like glycogen or glycosylation we've

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000
talked about before. Here a
bond has been made between a

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000
base, and we'll talk about
the different bases shortly,

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:25.000
and the 1-prime hydroxyl of the
ribose. Over here at the 5-prime

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
hydroxyl yet another
condensation reaction.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Sometimes this is called
an esterification reaction.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.000
And again esterification refers
to these kinds of condensation

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
reactions where an acid and
a base react with one another,

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
and once again through
a condensation reaction,

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
yield the removal of a water.
And let's look at what's happening

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
here, because not only is one
phosphate group attached to the

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000
5-prime carbon, to
the 5-prime hydroxyl.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000
In fact, there are three. And
they are located, and each of

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000
them has a name. The
inboard one is called alpha,

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
moving further out is beta,
and furthest out is gamma.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
And it turns out that this chain
of phosphates have very important

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.000
implications for energy
metabolism and for biosynthesis.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
Why? I'm glad I asked that
question. Because these are all

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000
three highly negatively charged.
This is negatively charged,

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
this is and this is. And, as you
know, negative charges repel one

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000
another. And as a consequence,
to create a triphosphate linkage

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
like this represents pushing
together negative charged moieties,

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000
these three phosphates, even though
they don't like to be next to one

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.000
another. And that pushing together,
that creation of the triphosphate

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000
chain represents an investment
of energy. And once the three are

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000
pushed together that represents
great potential energy much like a

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
spring that has been compressed
together and would just

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
love to pop apart. These
three phosphates would love to

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.000
pop apart from one another by virtue
of the fact that these negative

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
charges are mutually repelling.
But they cannot as long as they're

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
in this triphosphate configuration.
But once the triphosphate

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
configuration is broken then the
energy released by their leaving one

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
another can then be exploited
for yet other purposes.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Keep in mind, just to reinforce
what I said a second ago,

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000
the difference between a ribose and
a deoxyribose is the presence or the

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:42.000
absence of this oxygen. And
now let's focus in a little

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000
more detail on the bases because the
bases are indeed the subject of much

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
of our discussion today. And
we have two basic kinds of

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000
bases. They're called
nitrogenous bases, these bases,

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
because they have nitrogen in them.
And if you look at the five bases

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:03.000
that are depicted here you'll see
that they are not aromatic rings

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
with just carbons in them
like a six carbon benzene.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Rather all of them have a
substantial fraction of nitrogens

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
actually in the ring, two in
the case of these pyrimidines.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
And here you see the
number actually is four.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
In fact, one of these
nitrogenous bases indicated here,

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
guanine has actually a fifth
one up here as a side chain.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000
This is outside of the chain, it
represents a side group. And if

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000
we begin now to make distinctions
between the ring itself and the

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
entities that protrude out of the
ring, they really represent some of

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000
the important distinguishing characteristics.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
It's important that we understand
that pyrimidines have one ring and

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
these have two rings in them.
The purines have a five and a six

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
membered ring fused together,
as you can see. The pyrimidines

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000
have only a six membered ring.
And what's really important in

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
determining their identity is
not the basic pyrimidine or purine

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
structure. It's once again the side
chains that distinguish these one

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000
from the other. Here in
the case of cytosine we see

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000
that there's a carbonyl here, an
oxygen sticking out, and there's

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
an amine over here. We see
uracil which happens to be

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000
present in RNA but not DNA which
has two carbonyls here and here.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Obviously, therefore what
distinguishes these two from one

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
another is this oxygen
versus this amine.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
And here we see the thymine which
is present in DNA but not RNA.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
And this will become very
familiar to you shortly.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
This looks just like uracil except
for the fact that there's a methyl

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
group sticking out here.
Now, very important for our

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:51.000
understanding of what's happening
here is the fact that this methyl

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.000
group, although it distinguishes
thymine from uracil is itself

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.000
biologically actually
very important.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.000
It's there to be sure and it's a
distinguishing mark of T versus U,

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000
but the business end of T versus
U in terms of encoding information

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
happens here with these two oxygens
sticking out. They're the important

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000
oxygens, here and here. And
therefore from the point of

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
view of information content,
as we'll soon see, T and U are

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000
essentially equivalent. It
may be that one of them happens

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000
to be in RNA and the other in
DNA, but from the point of view of

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000
understanding the coding information
they carry it's these two carbonyls

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
here and here which dictate
essentially their identity.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
We have the same kind of dynamics
that operate here in the case of A

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
and G where once again this one has
only an amine side chain and this

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
one has a carbonyl and an
amine side chain right here.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Now, very important there is a
confusing array of names that are

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
associated with all this.
I don't know if it you can,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
well, it reads reasonably
well. Because once a base,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
and I just showed you bases which
are unattached to the sugars,

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000
once bases are attached to the
sugars they change their name

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
slightly. So keep in mind that here,
when we talk about these nitrogenous

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
bases, the bases are just free
molecules where in each case this

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:23.000
lowest nitrogen is the one that
participates in the formation of a

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000
covalent glycosidic bond with
the ribose or the deoxyribose

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:32.000
underneath it. And here
we can see one indication

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
of how that, you see this N,
in all cases via a condensation

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.000
reaction, forms a covalent
bond with a five carbon sugar,

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000
once again deoxyribose or ribose.
Once the base associates with the

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000
sugar, that is the base plus
the sugar is called a nucleoside.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
So when we talk in polite company
about a nucleoside we're not talking

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:02.000
about free bases. We're
talking about the covalent

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
interaction of a pentose binding to
a base. The pentose could be one or

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
the other of these two. And
that's what a nucleoside is.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
If on top of that we add
additionally one or more phosphates

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
then we even modify our language
even further because a base attached

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.000
to a sugar which in turn is
attached to a phosphate is called

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:34.000
a nucleotide.
The nucleotide,

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.000
the T is there to designate
the fact that there's actually,

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:42.000
in addition to the base and the
sugar there's a phosphate which is

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:46.000
attached and extends off the end.
And there are slightly different

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000
names. For the purposes of this
course we won't get into this very

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000
arcane nomenclature because it is,
to be frank, and you know I always

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000
am frank with you,
confusing. Here is U.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And when uracil, the base
becomes linked to a ribose

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
it changes its name from uracil to
uridine. Cytosine changes its name

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
to cytidine when it becomes a
nucleoside by a covalent linkage to

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
either ribose or deoxyribose.
Thymine becomes thymidine. And the

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000
same nomenclature exists, the
shift in their names exists in

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:26.000
the case of the purines as well,
adenine becomes adenosine and so

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
forth. We need to
focus mostly on the

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
notion of A, C, T, G and
U. Those are the things we

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
need to think about. And
why is this nomenclature

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
confusing? Well, here the
nucleoside ends with osine,

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
O-S-I-N-E. You see that here?
You say that's easy to remember,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
but look up here. Here the
base ends with O-S-I-N-E.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:56.000
And so this nomenclature which was
cobbled together in the early 20th

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
century will bedevil us and
generations of biology students to

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:05.000
come. Oh well, that's life.
Now, one of the things we're

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000
interested in and which I talked
about briefly last time was the

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
whole notion of polymerization,
i.e., how we actually polymerize a

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
chain. Let's look at this
illustration which I think is more

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.000
useful. Recall the fact that I
emphasized with great seriousness

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:27.000
the fact that nucleic acid synthesis
always occurs in a certain polarity.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
It goes in a certain direction.
You cannot add nucleotides on one

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
end or the other end willy-nilly.
You can only add them onto the

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.000
3-prime end. And keep in mind that
the reason why this is defined as

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000
the 5-prime end is that this is,
the last hydroxyl sticking out at

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000
this end comes out of the
5-prime carbon right here,

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000
the 5-prime hydroxyl. And
conversely at this end we're

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.000
adding another base at the
3-prime hydroxyl, at this end,

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.000
which creates the 3-prime
end of the DNA or the RNA.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:08.000
In fact, the polymerization always
occurs between the 5-prime end of a

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:13.000
deoxyribonucleotide indicated here
where the bases remain anonymous and

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
the 3-prime hydroxyl. That's
the way it always happens.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:24.000
And here we begin to appreciate
the role of the high energy

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000
phosphate linkage.
Because this high energy

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000
triphosphate linkage, which
is synthesized elsewhere in

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
the cell like a coiled spring and
which contains a lot of potential

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.000
energy by virtue of this mutual
negative repulsion of the phosphate

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000
groups, this energy is used to form
the bond here between the phosphate

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000
in this condensation reaction
and the 3-prime hydroxyl.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
So that requires an investment of
energy. And the resulting linkage

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:03.000
which is formed is sometimes
called a phosphodiester linkage.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000
Why phosphodiester? Well,
obviously it's phospho.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000
And there actually are two
esterifications that are occurring

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
here. If we look at one of these
phosphodiester bonds we see that an

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000
ester linkage has been made with
this hydroxyl and an ester linkage

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
has been made with this hydroxyl.
And for that reason it's called a

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:25.000
phosphodiester linkage.
Therefore we come to realize that

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000
polymerization of nucleic acids
doesn't take place spontaneously.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000
It requires the investment
of a high-energy molecule,

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
the investment of the energy that
it carries. And when this linkage is

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
formed the diphosphate here,
the beta and the gamma phosphates

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:47.000
float off into interstellar space.
It's only the alpha phosphate that

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000
is retained to form the resulting
diphosphate, a phosphodiester

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000
linkage. And this process can be
repeated literally thousands and

00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000
millions of times. An
average human's chromosomes

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
contains on the order of tens,
fifty, a hundred mega-bases of DNA.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000
A mega-base is a million
bases or a million nucleotides.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
So there you can understand that
there's no limit to the extent of

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.000
elongation of these various
kinds of molecules. Now,

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
note by the way yet another
feature of this which is that the

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
distinguishing feature between
DNA and RNA, the most important

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
distinguishing feature
is this 2-prime hydroxyl.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And here we're talking about DNA,
but we could almost in the same

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
breath be talking about the
way that RNA gets polymerized.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Why? Because this 2-prime hydroxyl
or this 2-prime hydrogen in this

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000
case is out of the line of fire.
The business action is happening

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
right along here. Look
where the business action is

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.000
in terms of the backbone. The
2-prime hydroxyl is off to the

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000
side. And whether it's oxygen
or just whether it's OH,

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:02.000
that is in ribose, a hydroxyl
group or just a hydrogen,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
as is indicated here in the case
of deoxyribose, is irrelevant

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
to the polymerization. And
therefore we can guess or intuit,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
and just because we guessed
doesn't mean it's wrong,

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.000
often it's right, it
doesn't really make much

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
difference whether we look at DNA or
RNA. Here's a polymerization scheme

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
of RNA and it's absolutely
identical to that of DNA.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.000
In this case it's ribonucleotide
triphosphates that are used for the

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:35.000
polymerization reaction. Now
here I just uttered the phrase

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000
ribonucleoside triphosphates.
Why did I say that? Well,

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:47.000
ultimately only the good
Lord knows why I said that.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000
But let's look at this phrase. I
said ribonucleoside triphosphate

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000
rather than ribonucleotide
triphosphate because the fact that I

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000
added this on the end makes
the T there unnecessary.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
The T is there to indicate the
phosphate being attached to the

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
ribose or the deoxyribose. But
if I'm adding this phrase over

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.000
here, triphosphate,
that obviates, that makes

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
unnecessary my saying ribonucleotide
triphosphate. If I'm looking at UTP

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.000
or ATP, I would say I'm a
ribonucleotide if I don't mention

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000
the triphosphate. But the
moment this comes from my

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.000
lips then we'll say ribonucleoside
indicating that a ribonucleoside,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000
that is a base and a sugar are
then attached to one or more

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
phosphate linkages. Now,
the ultimate basis of the

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
biological revolution comes from
the realization that these different

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
bases have complementarity to one
another. That is they like to be

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000
together with one another. And
if we look at this and we think

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
about the DNA double helix we come
to realize that these bases have

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
affinities for one another.
And the general affinity is one

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
purine likes to be facing
opposite one pyrimidine.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000
One pyrimidine opposite one purine.
And if we have two pyrimidines

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000
facing one another they're not
close enough to one another to kiss.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
And if we have two purines
they're too close to one another,

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000
they're bumping into one another,
they take up too much space. And

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000
therefore the optimal configuration
is one purine and one pyrimidine.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
And you can see these two pairings
here in the case of what happens

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
with DNA. In fact, the
realization of this diagram

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
right here is what triggered
the discovery of DNA in 1953.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
This diagram right here is what
triggered the biological revolution.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000
And though it's been depicted in
many, many ways it's worthwhile

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000
dwelling on it because this is
perhaps the most important diagram

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
that we'll address all semester.
Although this doesn't mean we have

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
to spend all semester assimilating
it. It's not so complicated.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
It's relatively straightforward.
And let's look at its features.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000
Let's dwell on them momentarily
because this is a microscopic

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000
snapshot of what DNA is composed
of. You all know it's a double helix

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
and therefore there are two
strands of DNA in a double helix.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
And one of the interesting
things about the double helix,

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000
although we're not showing it yet,
we're just showing a little section

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000
of a double helix, is the
polarity of the two chains

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000
that constitute the double helix.
Let's look at that polarity.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
This one is running in
one direction and this one,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
the opposite one, the complementary
one is running in the other

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000
direction. And therefore we talk
about the double helix as being

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.000
anti-parallel. Well,
I guess I should have a

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
bandage on the other finger to
convince you but you get the idea.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:59.000
They're running in
opposite directions.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000
They're not both pointed the same.
And the other thing to indicate is,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000
to repeat what I said just seconds
ago, that there's a complementarity

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.000
between the purines and the
pyrimidines. So we use the word

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
complementary with great frequency,
with great promiscuity in biology.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Complementarity refers to the fact
that A and T here or A and U because

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:27.000
I said U and T are functionally
equivalent, they like to

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:32.000
be opposite one another. There's
a purine and a pyrimidine.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
And the converse is the case with C
and G, they like to be opposite one

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
another. Now, there
is specificity here.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000
You might say any purine can
pair up with any pyrimidine,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000
but it's not the case. For instance,
A doesn't like to be opposite C and

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
T doesn't like to be opposite G.
So one of the things we have to

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000
memorize this semester, and
it's not many and it's not hard,

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.000
is that A and T are opposite
one another, or A and U,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
and G and C are opposite one another.
That's one of the essential concepts

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000
in molecular biology. There
are now a thousand things you

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000
need to learn, but if
you don't understand that

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
then ultimately sooner or later
you'll find yourself in a swamp,

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
literally or figuratively. Now,
let's look at the different between

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:21.000
these two. One of the interesting
things is, to state the obvious,

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000
the way they're associating
with one another, hand in glove,

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.000
is via hydrogen bonds. That's
not any covalent interaction,

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.000
which means they're reversible.
We talked about that.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Which means that if we were to take
a solution of double stranded DNA

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
and boil it we would
break those hydrogen bonds.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Remember they only have 8
kilocalories per mole and boiling

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.000
water has far higher energetic
content. And consequently if we

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000
heat up a DNA double helix and we
break those double bonds of DNA that

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000
hold the two strands together,
the two strands come apart, the DNA

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.000
ends up being denatured,
that is the two strands are

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000
separated one from the other.
In fact, if there ever were a

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000
covalent cross-link between the two
strands that's really bad news for a

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000
cell carrying such a DNA double
helix. A covalently cross-link from

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000
one strand to the other DNA double
helix represents often a sign that a

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000
cell should go off and die because
it has a very hard time dealing with

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
that by virtue of the fact,
as we will soon learn or as you

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:27.000
already know, the cell has, with
some frequency, to pull apart

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000
these two strands. And
therefore this association must

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
be tight enough so that it's stable
at body temperature but not so tight

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
that it cannot be pulled apart when
certain biological conditions call

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
for it. You see that in fact here
there are three hydrogen bonds and

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000
here there are only two
hydrogen bonds. That also has its

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:51.000
implications. It turns out to be
the case that the disposition of

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
this hydrogen and this oxygen here,
they're far enough apart that for

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000
all practical purposes they
don't really make very good

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000
hydrogen bonds. And
therefore we think of this as

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:07.000
having two and this having three.
And if you were to try to put C

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000
opposite A or G opposite T you'd see
that they cannot form hydrogen bonds

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
well with one another. Instead
they kind of bump into one

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
another, and therefore are not
complementary to one another at all.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000
There's another corollary that
we can deduce from this diagram,

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000
and that is the following. If
it's always true that A equal

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:36.000
C and G
equal T --

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
A equals T and G equals C. By
the way, this is an interesting

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
story. This is the Chargaff Rule.
Because about a year or so before

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Watson and Crick figured out the
structure of the double helix there

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000
was a guy named Erwin Chargaff in
New York at Columbia University who

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
one day figured out that if you
looked at a whole bunch of nucleic

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
acids, different DNAs from
different cell types --

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:09.000
And in certain cell types what
he found was that G was equal to,

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:16.000
for example G equals 20%
of the bases. Therefore,

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:23.000
obviously we know C must equal also
20% because there always has to be a

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
C opposite a G in the double helix,
right? G and C always have to be

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:36.000
equal. And Chargaff discovered that,
in fact, A in such DNA always was

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:43.000
30% and T was also 30%. Well,
these together make up 100%

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:49.000
which is, we're not in higher math
yet, but A and T were always the

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000
same. If you looked at another type
of DNA he might find that G equals

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
23% and C also equals 23%. And
in this same DNA then A would

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:05.000
equal 27%, I guess,
and T also equals 27%.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000
And I hope that adds up to 100%.
So he looked at a whole bunch of

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000
DNAs and they always tracked
one another, A always tracked T,

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
G always tracked C. And then in
1953 up comes these two guys from

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Cambridge, England, Watson
and Crick whom Chargaff

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000
regarded as upstarts, as
smart-asses who thought they knew

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000
all the answers. And
Watson and Crick said,

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000
gee, this Chargaff rule really is
very interesting because it suggests

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
something about the structure of DNA.
These cannot just be coincidences.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000
There's something profoundly
important they said,

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000
correctly, in the fact that there
was always an equivalence between A

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000
and T and between G and C.
And that represented one of the

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000
conceptual cornerstones of
their elucidating the structure

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
of the double helix. And so
Chargaff who died last year

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:05.000
or the year before last, at an
advanced age, was for the next

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000
fifty years a very bitter man,
because he was this far away from

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000
figuring out this far. Not
this far, but this far away

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:17.000
from figuring out, making
the most important discovery

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000
in biology in the 20th century.
He had the information right there.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
And if he thought a little bit
about information theory and thought

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
a little bit about the way
information content is encoded he

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
could have already predicted,
not the detailed structure of the

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000
double helix, but at least the way
in which it encodes information.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Because, to state the obvious,
and as many of you know already,

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
if one looks at the structure
of a double helix one can,

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000
in principle, depict it in a two
or a three-dimensional cartoon.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Here's the way one can think of it.
This is the way we've been talking

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:58.000
about it over the last couple of
minutes. It's a two-dimensional

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000
double helix. And from
the point of view of

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
information encoding, it
doesn't really matter whether we

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000
draw it this way or that way. It
happens that the double helix is

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
turned around like that,
it's twisted around. It's very

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:18.000
difficult for biological molecules
to be totally flat for an extended

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
period. And the helix is,
in fact, something that is

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:26.000
frequently resorted to.
Witness the alpha helix in the

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.000
protein. So these are turned around.
It turns out that each of these

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
constitutes a base pair, and
each of these base pairs is,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000
in fact, 3.4 angstroms
apart. 3.4 angstroms thick.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000
So you have ten of them, the
DNA helix advances 3.4 angstroms

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.000
every ten turns. And
ten turns is roughly,

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:54.000
oh, I'm sorry. Ten base pairs is
roughly one turn of the alpha helix.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
So if you go here and you count up
ten, we should start again at the

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:04.000
same orientation. Another
ten is another turn.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Another ten is another turn. In
fact, I'm just recalling that I

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
was once a TA in 7. 1 in
1965. And there was a physics

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000
professor who became a biologist
who always talked about these double

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000
helices. And he always talked about
the measurements of different DNA

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:30.000
molecules. Now, you may
know that the term angstrom

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:36.000
is named after a Danish
person named Angstrom.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
That's why it got its name.
So whenever this professor,

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
whom I never corrected, God forbid,
ever talked about something that was

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
ten angstroms long, he
called these ten angstra.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Now, as you know, when you go in a
Latin verb from singular to plural

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
it's -um to -a, right?
So he pretended this was a

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Latin word.
What's a good word?

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Sorry? What's a common
Latin word we use? Sorry?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
Millennium. Yeah,
millennium, millennia.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000
So he went from angstrom to anstra.
And it went on for a whole year. I

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.000
never said anything but
I knew better. OK, anyhow.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Here you see the genius
of Watson and Crick. And,

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:28.000
by the way, Angstrom was a Dane,
as I said, and not a Roman soldier.

00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:32.000
So here we see. OK. So
here is the genius of their

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
discovery. And the elegance of
it is not how complicated it is.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.000
The elegance of it is how simple
it is, because information we see is

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000
encoded in two strands.
The information is redundant

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000
because if we know the sequence of
one strand we can obviously predict

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:55.000
the sequence in the other strand
because it's a complementary

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:00.000
sequence. If we always
realize that A is

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
opposite T and G is opposite C we
can know directly that a sequence in

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000
one strand, which may be A, C,
T, G, G, C and the other strand

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000
moving in the other anti-parallel
direction the sequence is like this.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:21.000
I don't need to know the
sequence of the other strand.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:26.000
I can predict it by using
these rules of complementary

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:31.000
sequence structure.
And that, in turn,

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.000
obviously has important implications.
If we look at the three-dimensional

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
structure, this is more of what's
called a space-filing model.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:44.000
This is the way the x-ray
crystallographer would actually

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
depict it. We talked about
space-filling models before.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:53.000
One of the things we appreciate is
the fact that the phosphates are on

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.000
the outside and these bases are in
the inside. And because these bases

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000
are able also to stack with one
another via hydrophobic interactions

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
importantly the bases are protected.
The face where they interact is

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000
protected from the outside world.
What do I mean by that? Well,

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000
let's go back to this figure right
here. You see the interaction faces

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.000
between A and T or C and G they're
not on the outside of the helix.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
They're hidden in the middle. And
that's important because it means

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
that these interactions
between A and C and G and T,

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:27.000
you can see it up here as well,
are biochemically protected from any

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000
accidents that might
happen on the outside.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000
They're sheltered from that.
And that's important because the

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000
information content in DNA
must be held very stable,

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
very constant. If it isn't then
we have real trouble like cancer.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
And therefore whenever a cell
divides and copies its DNA,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
its three billion base pairs of DNA,
whenever that happens the number of

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:55.000
mistakes that are made is only three
or four or five out three billion.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
A stunningly low rate. And
this DNA can sit around.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
I told you about Neanderthal
DNA that can sit around for 30,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
00 years and it's
chemically relatively stable.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
In part, a testimonial to the
fact that this base pairing,

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:16.000
the face where the two bases
interact across one another,

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
this is shielded from the outside
world because it's tucked into the

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
middle, these interaction faces
here. This is the inside of the helix.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
Here the sugar phosphate
groups are on the outside.

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
In fact, when Watson and Crick were
struggling with the structure of the

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
double helix they were in a horse
race with a man named Linus Pauling

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000
who was really the inventor, the
discoverer of the hydrogen bond

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000
pretty much who actually got two
Nobel Prizes in his lifetime who

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000
ended his life believing that if
you took enough vitamin C grams of it

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000
every day you would never get sick.
I don't know what he died of, but

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000
probably like Dr. Atkins
he probably died of an

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000
illness he was trying to ward off.
Or he might have died of kidney

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
failure from all the vitamin
C he was putting into his body.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Who knows? Anyhow, I digress.
The fact is that Pauling thought

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:14.000
that, in fact, DNA was
constituted of a triple

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
helix, with three strands,
and that the bases were facing

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.000
outward. Well, of course,
now we can snicker,

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
now we can laugh, but at
the time nobody had any idea.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Now we realize it's only a
double helix and the bases

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
are facing inward.
And, of course,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.000
because Pauling worked
with that preconception,

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
he was never able to figure
what was actually going on,

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000
even though Watson and Crick thought
that he had the answer and was about

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000
to scoop them. Implicit
in what I've just said is

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
the notion that the structure of
DNA, which we'll talk about later,

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
allows it to be copied, i.e.,
now we're referring in passing,

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:01.000
and we'll get into this in
greater detail later, to the whole

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000
process of replication. Because
if we have genetic material

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
and we've created in a certain
sequence we must be able to make

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:13.000
more copies of it. Keep in
mind that each one of us,

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
as I mentioned to you some lectures
ago, we start out with a fertilized

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.000
egg with one human genome, and
through our lifetimes we produce

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
how many cells?
Anybody remember?

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.000
I did mention it, right? Is
there one soul who remembers it?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Remember the whole story of Sodom
and Gomorrah where the Lord says if

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:41.000
there's one soul, one
righteous soul in the city I

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
will spare the city. And
of course there wasn't so he

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:52.000
wiped them all out.
30 trillion? Well,

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000
sorry. What do we do for him?
Something nice. [APPLAUSE]

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Excellent. OK. You'll
remain anonymous,

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.000
though. You won't be on that
video. OK. Ten to the sixteenth cell

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
divisions in a human lifetime.
And on every one of those occasions

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
the double helix is copied. I'm
telling you that only to give

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.000
you the most dramatic demonstration
of the fact that if you have one set

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:22.000
of DNA molecules you need to be able
to copy it, you need to be able to

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:26.000
replicate it. And that replicative
ability is inherent in the double

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000
helix as Watson and Crick
immediately said and as they noted

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
at the end of their paper when --
I think the last sentence says it

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.000
has not escaped our
attention that this structure,

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
i.e., the structure of the
double helix, allows for copying,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:44.000
allows for replication. Because
if you pull the two strands apart,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
recall we said earlier that in
certain biological situations you

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000
need to do that, if the
two strands are pulled apart

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000
not by putting them in boiling
water but by enzymes whose dedicated

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000
function it is to
separate the two strands.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Then when that happens one can begin
to create two new daughter double

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:10.000
helices by simply adding on new
bases and thereby replicating the

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:16.000
DNA. And how that happens
is, of course, as you know, IO

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:22.000
"Intuitively Obvious". OK.
Uh-oh, we're in a dyslexic

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:28.000
moment. Now, the fact is I
emphasized with great vigor

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
and conviction --
And remember, class,

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
when somebody is convinced of
something more often than not

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
they're just wrong in a loud voice.
But I nevertheless emphasized with

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000
great conviction that T and U are,
from an information standpoint,

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:49.000
functionally equivalent.
They're replaceable,

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:53.000
interchangeable. And
therefore if we want we can

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
make an RNA copy of a DNA molecule
by realizing that if this were DNA

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
we could make an RNA that was
complementary to a DNA strand

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
realizing that when the RNA
molecule was being polymerized,

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
instead of using T one would use
U. All the other three bases are

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
functionally equivalent. And
so we could, in principle,

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000
and indeed it happens transiently,
we could make a DNA-RNA hybrid helix

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.000
where a DNA molecule is wrapped
around an RNA molecule because the

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
two molecules are functionally
equivalent. The only difference

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:29.000
between the two strands would be,
well, there are two differences.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000
One, in the RNA strand we'd
have a U instead of a T.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
And, two, in the RNA strand all the
sugars would be ribose rather than

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000
deoxyribose. Right on. OK.
Good. So this structure,

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000
the simplicity of the structure
gives one enormous power in encoding

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000
all kinds of information
and replicating it.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.000
What it means, as we'll discuss
also in great detail later,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
is that if we have a certain
sequence of bases in the double

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000
helix of DNA an RNA molecule could
be made to copy one of the two

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
strands to make a
complementary copy.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000
And that RNA molecule could then
leave the DNA double helix having

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:15.000
lifted one of the sequences from it
and then move to another part of the

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
cell where it might do something
interesting. And therefore to

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:23.000
extract information out of the
double helix doesn't necessarily

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.000
mean to destroy it. If
one can copy one of the two

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.000
double strands in a complementary
form as an RNA molecule that may

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
enable the information that is
encoded in the DNA to be copied

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
without destroying the
double helix itself.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Again, that process, which
we'll also talk about later,

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:48.000
is called the process
of transcription.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
And so in the course of this
morning I have uttered the three

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
words which represent the cannon,
the basic fundaments of molecular

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
biology. What are the three words?
Replication, transcription and

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
translation. Transcription means
when you make an RNA copy of a

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000
strand of the DNA double helix.
Let's just add a couple more

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
footnotes to what I've been saying
just so we are on firm ground for

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:20.000
subsequent discussions. It
turns out that often in RNA

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000
molecules they can form
intramolecular double helices.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
There's no reason why you cannot
make a double helix out of RNA as

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:34.000
you can make out of DNA. And
therefore you see often in many

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:38.000
kinds of RNA molecules they will
hydrogen bond to themselves using

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
these complementary sequences.
And this is called a hairpin, by

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
the way for obvious reasons. And
so many RNA molecules, most of

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:51.000
them in fact have these
intramolecular hydrogen bonded

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000
double helices with confers on
them very specific structure.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000
One other aspect of the two
versus three hydrogen bonds

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000
is the following. If a double
helix has many Gs and Cs

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
then it's going to have more
hydrogen bonds holding it together

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
than if it has few Gs and Cs.
So let's look at the Chargaff

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
example. Chargaff who lived for
fifty years stewing in his own bile

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:23.000
in bitterness because he
couldn't figure this out,

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:28.000
which is exactly what
happened by the way.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
And so here this has a higher G plus
C content, the one on the right than

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000
this one. This is 23% or 46%
G plus C. This is 40% G plus C.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:40.000
If it's 46% G plus C that means
there are more hydrogen bonds

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
holding the two strands together.
And it turns out that if you want

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:48.000
to denature a double helix that has
high G plus C content you need to

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:52.000
put in more energy, you need
to heat the double helix up

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000
to a higher temperature. It's
more difficult to pull the

00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:00.000
strands apart. One other
side comment on what I

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
wanted to say is the following.
The presence or the absence of this

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
hydroxyl here in RNA has an
important consequence for the

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:12.000
stability of RNA and DNA.
Let's look at what happens to an

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000
RNA chain when a hydroxyl ion,
which happens to be floating around

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
at a low concentration,
happens to attack this

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.000
phosphodiester bond.
What happens is that this

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:28.000
phosphodiester bond will tend
to cyclize. It's forming this

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
five membered ring. And
ultimately that will resolve and

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:37.000
break causing a cleavage of the RNA
chain. This phosphodiester bond now

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
forming a cyclic structure here
as an intermediate representing the

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000
precursor to the ultimately cleaved
chain. That means that if you take

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:51.000
RNA molecules and you put them in
alkali they will fall apart very

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:56.000
quickly for this very reason.
What happens to DNA molecules when

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000
you put them in alkali?
Nothing. They're alkali resistant

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:05.000
because there isn't a hydroxyl there
to form this five membered ring.

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:09.000
And therefore alkali cannot
cleave apart the DNA or the DNA

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:13.000
phosphodiester bond. If
we imagine that OH groups,

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000
that hydroxyls, are present
at a certain, albeit a certain

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.000
concentration, albeit
a low concentration in

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.000
neutral water we can see that
even at neutral pH with a certain

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.000
frequency RNA molecules
will slowly hydrolyze.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
They'll certainly be slowly
broken down by the hydroxyl ions.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:40.000
DNA molecules, however, will not.
And that represents yet another

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000
important biochemical reason why DNA
is chemically stable and why it can

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:50.000
carry information over years,
decades or tens of thousands of

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.000
years, because the phosphodiester
linkage in DNA rather than RNA is

00:49:55.000 --> 00:50:00.000
very stable chemically and can hold
these adjacent nucleotides together,

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:05.000
one to the other. See
you on Friday morning.

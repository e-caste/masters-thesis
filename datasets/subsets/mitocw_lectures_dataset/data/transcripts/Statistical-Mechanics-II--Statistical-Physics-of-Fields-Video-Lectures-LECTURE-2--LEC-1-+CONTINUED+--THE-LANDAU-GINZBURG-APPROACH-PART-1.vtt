00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.420
PROFESSOR: OK, let's
start, so last lecture,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.790
we were talking about elasticity
as an example of a field

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:33.600
theory-- statistical
field theory.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.110
And I ended the class by not
giving a very good answer

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:39.690
for a question was asked.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.280
So let's go back and revisit it.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.710
So the idea that we
had was that maybe we

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.560
have some kind of a lattice.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:55.250
And we make a
distortion through a set

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:02.570
of vectors in however many
dimensional space we are.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.740
And in the continuum
format, we basically

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.590
regarded this u as being an
average over some neighborhood.

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.610
But before going to do that,
we said that the energy cost

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.100
of the distortion at the
quadratic level-- of course,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.540
we can expand to go
to a higher level--

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.620
was the sum over all
pairs of positions,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.180
all pairs of components,
alpha and beta data

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.065
running from one to
a higher whatever

00:01:34.065 --> 00:01:39.710
the dimensionality of space
is u alpha at r or u beta

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:40.880
at r prime.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.270
The components alphabet beta
of this vector u at these two

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.690
different locations-- let's
say r and r prime here.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.720
And then there was some
kind of an object that

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.800
correlated the changes here
and here maybe obtained

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.070
as a second derivative
of a potential energy

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.690
as a function of the
entirety of the coordinates.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.440
And this in principle
or a general function

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.250
of all of these
distortions depends

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.510
on all pairs of variables.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.980
But then we said that because
we are dealing with a lattice

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.200
and one pair of
coordinates in the lattice

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.930
is the same as another
pair of coordinates

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.590
that have the same spatial
orientations that this function

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.240
merely is a function
of the separation

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.890
r minus r prime,
which of course can

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.650
be a vector in this lattice.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.550
And the fact that
it has this form

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.410
then allows us to simplify
this quadratic form

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.990
rather than be a sum over
pairs and squared, if you like,

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.480
into a sum over one
coordinate which

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.550
is the wave vector obtained
by Fourier transform.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.810
So once we Fourier
transform, that V

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:25.450
can be written as a sum over
just one set of K vectors,

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.110
of course appropriately
discretized depending

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.580
on the overall
size of the system

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.950
and confined to a [INAUDIBLE]
zone that is determined

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.290
by the type of wavelengths
that lattice structure allows.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.790
And

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.660
Then this becomes
your alpha tilde.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.070
The Fourier
transform's evaluated

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.060
at K and the other point, which
is minus K that if I write it

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.730
again as K is really this.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.910
And this entity, once
we Fourier transform it,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:07.160
becomes a function of
the wave number K. Now,

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.390
there is one statement
that is correct,

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:16.279
which is that if I have to take
the whole lattice and move it,

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:20.180
then essentially there
would be no cost.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.820
And moving the
entire lattice only

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.840
changes the Fourier component
that corresponds to K

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.890
equals to 0-- translation
of everything.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:39.105
So you know for sure that this
K alpha beta at K equals to 0

00:04:39.105 --> 00:04:40.325
has to be 0.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:47.840
Now, we did a little bit
more than that, then.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:55.120
We said, let's look not only at
K equals to 0, but for small k.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.850
And then for small
k, we are allowed

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.800
to make an expansion of this.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.790
And this is the
expansion K squared,

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.020
K to the fourth,
et cetera, that we

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.570
hope to terminate at
low values of K. Now,

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.850
that itself is an assumption.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.830
That's part of the
locality that i

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.340
stated that I can make an
expansion as a function of K.

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:24.340
After all, let's
say K to the 1/2

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.720
is a function that goes
to 0 at K equals to 0.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.140
But it is non analytic.

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.075
Turns out that in order to
generate that kind of non

00:05:34.075 --> 00:05:37.070
analyticity in
this, this function

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.170
in real as a function
of separation

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.420
should decay very slow.

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:44.050
Sometimes something like
a Coulomb interaction

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.220
that is very long
range will give you

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.360
that kind of singularity.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.220
But things that are
really just interacting

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:55.340
within some neighborhood or
even if they are long range,

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.180
if the action falls of
sufficiently rapidly--

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:00.700
and that's one of the things
that we will discuss later

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.830
on-- precisely what
kind of potential

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.800
allow you to make
an expansion that

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.235
is analytical in powers
of k and hence consistent

00:06:09.235 --> 00:06:12.680
with this idea of locality.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.100
Let's also ignore
cases where you

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.350
don't have inversion symmetry.

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:22.100
So we don't need to start
and worry about anything

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:26.110
that is linear in K. So the
first thing that I can appear

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.272
is quadratic in K.

00:06:29.272 --> 00:06:33.030
Now, when we have things
that are quadratic in K,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.040
I have to make an
object that has

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.940
two indices-- alpha and beta.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.900
And, well, how can I do that?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.435
Well, the kinds of things
that I mentioned last time, we

00:06:43.435 --> 00:06:46.060
could a term that is K squared.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.980
And then we have a
delta alpha beta.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.350
If I insert that over
here, what do I get?

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.150
I get K squared delta alpha beta
will give me U tilde squared.

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.170
So that's the term that is in
an isotropic solid identified

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:07.840
with the shear modulus.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.250
Again, if the
system is isotropic,

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:16.960
I don't know any distance
apart from any other distance,

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.790
any direction, any
other direction.

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:23.540
I can still make another
tensor between this

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:28.240
is alpha and beta by
multiplying k alpha and k beta.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:31.480
If I then multiply
this with this,

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.640
I will get K.U-- the
dot product squared.

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.010
So that's the other term
that in an isotropic solid

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:43.610
was identified with
nu plus lambda over 2.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:49.380
Now, as long as any direction
for K in this lattice

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:53.080
is the same, those are
really the only terms

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.830
that you can write down.

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.210
But suppose that your
system was unisotropic,

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.290
such as for example a
rectangular lattice.

00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:07.360
Or let's imagine we put
a whole bunch of coins

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.250
here to emphasize that
rather than something

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:12.750
like a square lattice,
we have something

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:16.112
that is very rectangular.

00:08:16.112 --> 00:08:19.900
In this case, we can see
that the x and y directions

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.940
are not the same.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:26.760
And there is no reason why
this K squared here could not

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.440
have been separately kx
squared plus some other number

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:31.000
ky squared.

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.150
And hence, the type of
elasticity that you would have

00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:41.010
would no longer depend
on just two numbers.

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:45.470
But, say, over here with three,
in fact there would be more.

00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:50.110
And precisely how many
independent elastic constants

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:57.110
are given depend on the point
group symmetry-- the way

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:59.470
that your lattice is
structured over here.

00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:02.880
But that's another story that
I don't want to get into.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.520
But last time, I
was rather careless

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.920
and I said that just rotational
symmetry will give you

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.360
this k squared, k alpha, k beta.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.860
I have to be more
precise about that.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.790
So this is what's happened.

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:25.290
Now, given that you have
an isotropic material,

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.940
then the conclusion is
that the potential energy

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.870
will have two types of terms.

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:32.680
There is the type
of term that goes

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:39.080
with k squared u tilde squared.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:40.830
And then there's a
type of term that

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:48.600
goes with u plus lambda over 2k
tilde k times u tilde squared.

00:09:51.497 --> 00:09:53.080
Now you can see that
immediately there

00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:57.140
is a distinction between
two types of distortion.

00:09:57.140 --> 00:10:02.170
Because if I select
my wave vector K here,

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:07.420
any distortion that
is orthogonal to that

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.630
then will not get the
contribution from this.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:16.840
And so the cost of those so
called transverse distortions

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:20.160
only come from u.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:27.600
Whereas if I make a
distortion that is along k,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.570
it will get contribution
from both of those two terms.

00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:40.430
And hence, the cost of those
longitudinal distortions

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:43.450
would be different.

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:48.280
So when we go back
to our story of how

00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:56.620
does the frequency depend
on a whole bunch of ks,

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.400
you can see that when
we go to the small k

00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:03.130
limit in an isotropic
material, it

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.420
you've established that there
will be longitudinal mode.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:11.240
And we'll some kind of
longitudinal sound velocity.

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:13.790
And in three
dimensions, there will

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.200
be two branches of the
transverse mode that

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.170
fall on top of each-other.

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.820
As I said, once you go
to further larger K,

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.640
then you can include all
kinds of other things.

00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:29.680
In fact, the types of
things that you can include

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.040
at fourth order,
sixth order, et cetera

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:36.510
again are constraints
somewhat by the symmetry.

00:11:36.510 --> 00:11:38.850
But their number proliferates.

00:11:38.850 --> 00:11:42.160
And eventually you get
all kinds of things

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:47.290
that could potentially describe
how these modes depend.

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:51.050
And those things are
dependent on your potential

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.570
I don't know too much about.

00:11:54.570 --> 00:11:59.270
And why was this relevant
to what we were discussing?

00:11:59.270 --> 00:12:05.560
We said that basically, once
you go to some temperature other

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:10.630
than zero, you start putting
energy into the modes.

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:14.940
And how far in frequency you
can go given your temperature,

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.460
typically, the maximum frequency
at the particular temperature

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.990
is of the order of kt over hr.

00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.950
So that if you are at
very high temperature,

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:31.110
all of the r1 equals [INAUDIBLE]
and all of the vibrations

00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:32.680
are relevant.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.100
But if you go to
low temperatures,

00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:38.590
eventually you hit
the regime where

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:43.840
only these long wavelength, low
frequency modes are excited.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.020
And your heat
capacity was really

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:50.080
proportional to how
many modes are excited.

00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:52.720
And from here, you
can see since omega

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.610
goes like T, either the
case, for longitudinal

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:59.740
or the k for
transverse has to be

00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:02.750
proportional to T the maximum 1.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.940
Larger values of
k would correspond

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:07.840
to frequencies that
are not excited.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:12.140
So all of the nodes
that are down here

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.370
are going to be excited.

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:16.150
How many of them are there?

00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:20.215
Up to from 0 to
this k max that is

00:13:20.215 --> 00:13:25.120
of the order of kt over h
bar and some sound velocity.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.490
So you would say that
the heat capacity which

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:32.920
is proportional to the number of
oscillators that you can have,

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.960
you kt-- kb per oscillator.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.650
The number of oscillators
was roughly volume

00:13:41.650 --> 00:13:50.770
times kt h bar v, cubed if
you are in three dimensions.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:53.220
You saw that it was
one in one dimension.

00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:57.010
So in general, it will
be something like d.

00:13:57.010 --> 00:14:02.270
Of course, here, I was kind
of not very precise because I

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.300
really have to separate
out the contribution

00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:09.340
of longitudinal modes and
transverse modes, et cetera.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:13.320
So ultimately, the
amplitude that I have

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.692
will depend on a
whole bunch of things.

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:25.500
But the functional form is
this universal t to the d.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:30.090
So the lesson that we would like
to get from this simple, well

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:34.870
known example is
that sometimes you

00:14:34.870 --> 00:14:39.320
get results that are
independent in form

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:43.280
for very different materials.

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.480
I will use the
term universality.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.480
And the origin of
that universality

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.960
is because we are
dealing with phenomena

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:55.450
that involve
collective behavior.

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.260
As k becomes small, you're
dealing with large wavelengths

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:02.550
encompassing the
collective motion of lots

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.045
of things that are
vibrating together.

00:15:05.045 --> 00:15:08.480
And so this kind of
statistical averaging

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:13.330
over lots of things that are
collectively working together

00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:18.600
allows a lot of the details
to in some sense be washed out

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.990
and gives you a
universal form just

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.110
like adding random variables
will give you a Gaussian if you

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:27.920
add sufficient many
of them together.

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.420
It's that kind of phenomenon.

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:32.880
Typically, we will be
dealing with these kinds

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:34.940
of relationships
between quantities

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.330
that have dimensions.

00:15:36.330 --> 00:15:38.420
Heat capacity has dimensions.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.730
Temperature has dimensions.

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:44.410
So the amplitude
will have to have

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:47.620
things that have dimensions
that come from the material

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:49.640
that you are dealing with.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.325
So the thing that is
universal is typically

00:15:53.325 --> 00:15:58.200
the exponents that appear
in these functional forms.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.080
So those are the kinds
of things that we

00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:03.350
would like to capture
in different contexts.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:10.270
Now, as I said,
this was supposed

00:16:10.270 --> 00:16:14.546
to be just an illustration
of the typical approach.

00:16:14.546 --> 00:16:16.950
The phenomenon that
we will be grappling

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.405
with for a large
part of this course

00:16:20.405 --> 00:16:22.080
has to do with
face transactions.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:32.410
And again, this is
a manifest result

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:37.010
of having interaction among
degrees of freedom that

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.550
causes them to collectively
behave separately differently

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:45.810
from how a single
individual would behave.

00:16:45.810 --> 00:16:52.930
And the example
that we discussed

00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.370
in the previous
course and is familiar

00:16:55.370 --> 00:17:06.540
is of course that of
ice, water, steam.

00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:10.660
So here, we can look
at things from two

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.720
different perspectives.

00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:17.890
One perspective, let's say
we start by-- actually,

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:23.460
let's start with the
perspective in which I show you

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.500
pressure and temperature.

00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.330
And as a function of
pressure and temperature,

00:17:30.330 --> 00:17:33.410
low temperatures
and high pressures

00:17:33.410 --> 00:17:41.690
would respond to having
some kind of a-- actually,

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:45.830
let me not incur
the wrath of people

00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:50.400
who know the slopes of
these curves precisely.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.730
So there is at low
temperatures, you have ice.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:59.030
And then the more
interesting part

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:02.960
is that you have at high
temperatures and low pressures

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.350
gas.

00:18:04.350 --> 00:18:06.860
And then at
immediate values, you

00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.410
have, of course, the liquid.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:16.630
And the other perspective
to look at this

00:18:16.630 --> 00:18:23.800
is to look at isoterms of
the system for pressure

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:25.290
versus velocity.

00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:30.930
So basically, what I'm doing is
I'm staking at some temperature

00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:35.300
and calculating the behavior
along that isoterm of how

00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:38.950
pressure and volume of
the system are related.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:42.120
So then you are far
out to the right,

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.540
you'll have behavior that is
releasing of an ideal gas.

00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:52.100
You have PV be proportional
to the number of particles

00:18:52.100 --> 00:18:53.530
in temperature.

00:18:53.530 --> 00:18:58.830
As you lower the
temperatures and you

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:08.330
hit this critical isoterm at
TC, the shape of the curve

00:19:08.330 --> 00:19:11.710
gets modified to
something like this.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:15.260
And if you're looking
at things at isoterms

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:21.220
at an even lower temperature,
you encounter a discontinuity.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:24.490
And that discontinuity
is manifested

00:19:24.490 --> 00:19:29.700
in a coexistent interval
between the liquid and gas.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:35.600
So isoterms for T
and less than TC

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.070
has this characteristic form.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.280
So here, I have not bothered
to go along the way down

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:51.040
to the case of the solid.

00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.850
Because our focus is going
to be mostly as to what

00:19:54.850 --> 00:20:01.150
happens at this critical
point-- TC and TC,

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:08.310
where the distinction between
liquid and gas disappears.

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:17.670
So there is here the
first case of a transition

00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:21.050
between different
types of material

00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:26.130
that is manifested here,
the solid line indicating

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:31.250
a discontinuity in various
thermodynamic properties.

00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:34.910
Discontinuity here
being, say, the density

00:20:34.910 --> 00:20:36.820
as a function of pressure.

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:39.790
Rather than having a nice
curve, you have a discontinuity.

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:44.720
In these curves, isoterms
are suddenly discontinuous.

00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:49.320
And the question that we
posed last time last semester

00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.580
was that essentially,
all the properties

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.960
of the system, the
thermodynamic properties, I

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:59.940
should be able to obtain
through the partition function,

00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.490
log of the partition function,
which involves an integral,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:05.610
let's say, over all
of the coordinates

00:21:05.610 --> 00:21:13.180
and momenta of some
kind of energy.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.050
And this energy in
the part about momenta

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.851
is not particularly important.

00:21:22.851 --> 00:21:25.260
Let's just get rid of that.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.470
And the part about
the coordinates

00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:32.305
involves some kind of
potential interaction

00:21:32.305 --> 00:21:35.220
between pairs of particles.

00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:37.110
That is not that difficult.

00:21:37.110 --> 00:21:39.980
Maybe particles are slightly
attracted to each other

00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.370
when they're close enough.

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.170
And they have a hard core.

00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:48.960
But somehow, after I do this
calculation bunch of integrals,

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:51.540
all of them are
perfectly well behaved.

00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:52.630
There is no divergence.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:53.130
As

00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.590
The range of
integration goes to zero

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.820
and infinity, I get
this discontinuity.

00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:02.410
And the question
of how that appears

00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:06.210
is something that clearly is
a consequence of interactions.

00:22:06.210 --> 00:22:08.050
If we didn't have
interactions, we

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.560
would have ideal gas behavior.

00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:18.710
And maybe this place is
really a better place

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:21.080
to go and try to
figure out what's

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:26.350
going on than any other
place in the phase diagram.

00:22:26.350 --> 00:22:30.100
The reason for that is in
the vicinity of this point,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.400
we can see that the difference
between liquid and gas

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.650
is gradually disappearing.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:40.975
So in some sense, we
have a small parameter.

00:22:40.975 --> 00:22:44.590
There's some small
difference that appears here.

00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:49.130
And so maybe the idea that
we can start with some phase

00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:51.600
that we understand fully
and then perturb it

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.520
and see how the singularity
appears is a good idea.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.720
I will justify for you
why that's the case

00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:04.060
and maybe why we can even
construct a statistical field

00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.220
theory here.

00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:12.030
But the reason it
is also interesting

00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:16.580
is that there is a lot of
experimental evidence as to why

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.640
you should be doing this.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.770
We discussed the phase diagrams.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.430
And we noticed that a
interesting feature of these

00:23:23.430 --> 00:23:32.150
phase diagrams is that below TC
when the liquid and gas first

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:36.070
manifest themselves
as different phases ,

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:40.200
there is a coexistence interval.

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:44.530
And this coexistence interval
is bounded on two sides

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:50.630
by the gas and liquid volumes
or alternatively densities.

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.420
Now, the interesting
experimental fact

00:23:53.420 --> 00:24:00.770
is that when you go and observe
the shape of this curve,

00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:04.410
for the whole bunch of
different gases-- here,

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:09.600
you have neon, argon, krypton,
xenon, oxygen, carbon dioxide,

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.330
methane, things that
are very different--

00:24:12.330 --> 00:24:17.550
and scale them appropriately so
that all of the vertical axes

00:24:17.550 --> 00:24:18.440
comes to one.

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:20.580
So you divide P by PC.

00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.890
You appropriately normalize
the horizontal axis

00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:26.380
so the maximum is at 1.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.240
You see that all of the
curves you get from very, very

00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:34.430
different systems after you
just do this simple scaling

00:24:34.430 --> 00:24:37.960
fall right on top of each-other.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.800
Now, clearly something like
carbon dioxide and neon,

00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.320
they have very different
inter atomic potentials

00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:49.010
that I have to put
in this calculation.

00:24:49.010 --> 00:24:53.560
Yet despite that,
there has emerged

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:57.380
some kind of a universal law.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.780
And so I should be
able to describe that.

00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.250
Why is that happening?

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:08.490
Now I'll try to convince
you that what I need to do

00:25:08.490 --> 00:25:10.710
is similar to what I did there.

00:25:10.710 --> 00:25:14.300
I need to construct a
statistical field theory.

00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:16.550
But we said that
statistical field theories

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:20.050
rely on averaging
over many things.

00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:23.450
So why is that justified
in this context?

00:25:23.450 --> 00:25:27.920
So there is a phenomenon
called critical opalescence.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:29.320
Let's look at it here.

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.710
Also, this serves to show
something that people sometimes

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:36.950
don't believe, which is that
since our experience comes

00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:42.330
from no pressures, where we cool
the gas and it goes to a liquid

00:25:42.330 --> 00:25:44.790
or heat it and
liquid goes to a gas

00:25:44.790 --> 00:25:47.960
and know that these
are different things,

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.290
it's kind of-- they
find it hard to believe

00:25:50.290 --> 00:25:52.770
that if I repeat the same
thing at high pressure,

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:55.190
there is no difference
between liquid and gas.

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.330
They are really the same thing.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:26:00.260
And so this is an
experiment that

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:03.670
is done going more or
less around here where

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:05.060
the critical point is.

00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:09.970
And you start initially at
the low temperatures side

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.580
where you can see that at
the bottom of your wire,

00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:14.190
you have a liquid.

00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:19.540
And a meniscus separates
it nicely from a gas.

00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:23.170
As you heat it up, you approach
the critical temperature.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:29.250
Well, the liquid expands
and keeps going up.

00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:33.040
And once you hit TC and beyond,
that well, one is the liquid

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:35.660
and which one's the gas?

00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:38.040
You can't tell the
difference anymore, right?

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.960
There is a variation in density.

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.800
Because of gravity, there's
more density down here up there.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:47.330
OK, now what happens when
we start to cool this?

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.220
Ah, what happened?

00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:51.270
That's called
critical opalescence.

00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:54.880
You can't see through that.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.640
And why?

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.480
Because there are all
of these fluctuations

00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:01.190
that you can now see.

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:04.860
Right at TC when the
thing became black,

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:08.490
there were so many fluctuations
covering so different length

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:11.970
scales that light
could not get through.

00:27:11.970 --> 00:27:15.660
But now gradually, the
size of the fluctuations

00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:18.670
which exists both in the
liquid and in the gas

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:23.450
are becoming small but
still quite visible.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:27.830
So clearly, despite the
fact that whatever atoms

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:31.660
and molecules you have over
here have very short range

00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:36.220
interactions, somehow in
the vicinity of this point,

00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.286
they decided to move
together and have

00:27:39.286 --> 00:27:40.536
these collective fluctuations.

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.750
So that's why we should be able
to do a statistical theory.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:52.510
And that's why there is a hope
that once we have done that,

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.710
because the important
fluctuations are covering

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:59.540
so many large numbers
of atoms or molecules,

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.230
we should be able to explain
what's going on over here.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:07.170
So that's the task
that we set ourselves.

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:11.750
Anything about this
before I close the video?

00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.930
OK.

00:28:16.930 --> 00:28:17.500
Yes?

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:22.179
AUDIENCE: There are
Gaussians that when rescaled,

00:28:22.179 --> 00:28:27.100
their plots still
comply to that?

00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:27.960
PROFESSOR: No.

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:28.820
No.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.870
In the vacinity-- so maybe
the range of the things

00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:36.530
that collapse on top
of each-other is small.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:38.860
Maybe it is so
small that you have

00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.940
to do things at low
pressure differences

00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.020
in order to see that.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:46.300
But as far as we
know, if you have

00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:49.160
sufficient high
resolution, everything

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.011
will collapse on top
of that [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:52.011 --> 00:28:56.220
And what is more interesting
than that-- that is not

00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:57.355
confined to gases.

00:29:00.290 --> 00:29:03.650
If I had done an
experiment that involved

00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:10.815
mixing some protein that has a
dense phase and a dilute phase

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:13.020
and I went to the
point where there

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:17.150
is a separation between dense
and dilute and I plotted that,

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.700
that would also fall exactly
on top of this [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.575
So it's not even gases.

00:29:22.575 --> 00:29:24.380
It's everything.

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:35.937
And so-- so yes?

00:29:35.937 --> 00:29:38.811
AUDIENCE: I heard
you built a system

00:29:38.811 --> 00:29:43.595
where some [INAUDIBLE] damages?

00:29:43.595 --> 00:29:44.220
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.080
And we will discuss those too.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.230
AUDIENCE: And the
exponents will change?

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.990
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:52.460
AUDIENCE: So it's [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.540
PROFESSOR: You may
anticipate from that T

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.390
to the D over there,
the dimension is

00:29:56.390 --> 00:30:00.332
an important point, yes.

00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:00.832
OK?

00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:04.735
Anything else?

00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:09.300
All right.

00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:12.245
I'm going to rather
than construct

00:30:12.245 --> 00:30:17.320
this theory, this
statistical filter

00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:21.080
for the case of this
liquid gas system,

00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:24.540
I'm going to do it for the
case of the ferromagnet

00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:30.590
just to emphasize this fact
that this result, this set

00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:36.090
of results spans much more
than simple liquid gas

00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:39.960
phenomena-- a lot of different
things-- and secondly,

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:43.640
because writing it for
the case of ferromagnet

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.980
is much simpler because
of the inherent symmetries

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.550
that I will describe
to you shortly.

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:52.540
So what is the phenomenon
that I would like to describe?

00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.330
What's the phase
transition in the case

00:30:54.330 --> 00:30:58.300
of the ferromagnet
like a piece of iron?

00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:04.480
Where one axis that is always of
interest to us is temperature.

00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:11.600
And if I have a piece of iron or
nickel or some other material,

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.150
out here at high temperatures,
it is a paramagnet.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.700
And there is a
critical temperature TC

00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:31.330
below which it becomes
a ferromagnet, which

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:35.240
means that it has some
permanent magnetization.

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.040
And actually, the reason
I drew the second axis is

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:46.990
that a very nice way to
examine the discontinuities

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:52.480
is to put an external magnetic
field and see what happens.

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.280
Because if you put an
external magnetic field

00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:08.730
like you put your piece of
magnet enclosed in some parent

00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:11.435
[INAUDIBLE] loop so
that you have field

00:32:11.435 --> 00:32:14.240
in one direction or
the other direction,

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.130
then as you change
this [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:17.130 --> 00:32:21.060
of the field on the
high temperature side,

00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:27.190
what you'll find is that if I
plot where the magnetization is

00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:31.380
pointing, well, if you put
the magnetic field on top

00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:34.160
of a paramagnet,
it also magnetizes.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:38.440
It does pull in the
direction of the field.

00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.510
The amount of
magnetization that you

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:45.680
have in the system when you are
on the high temperatures side

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:47.200
looks something like this.

00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.600
At very high fields,
all of your spins

00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:52.990
are aligned with the field.

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:55.950
As you low the field because
of entropy and thermal

00:32:55.950 --> 00:32:58.660
fluctuations, they
start to move around.

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.710
They have too much
fluctuation when

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:06.090
you're in the phase
that is a paramagment.

00:33:06.090 --> 00:33:11.350
And it then when
the field goes to 0,

00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:13.846
the magnetization
reverses itself.

00:33:13.846 --> 00:33:17.100
And you will get a
structure such as this.

00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:20.390
So this is the behavioral
of magnetization

00:33:20.390 --> 00:33:23.920
as a function of the
field if you go along

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.685
the path such as this which
corresponds to the paramagnet.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:35.260
Now, what happens if
I do the same thing

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:40.110
but I do it along a
looped route such as here?

00:33:40.110 --> 00:33:43.730
So again, when you are out
here at high magnetic field,

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:44.510
not much happens.

00:33:47.170 --> 00:33:57.080
But when you hit 0, then
you have a piece of magnet.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.830
It has some magnetization.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:04.480
So basically, it goes to
some particular value.

00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.690
There is hysteresis.

00:34:05.690 --> 00:34:10.110
So let's imagine that you
start with a system down here

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.130
and then reduce
the magnetic field.

00:34:12.130 --> 00:34:16.940
And you would be getting
a curve such as this.

00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:22.280
So in some sense,
right at H equals to 0

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:27.000
when you are 4T less than
TC, there is a discontinuity.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.247
You don't know whether you are
one side or the other side.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:39.550
And in fact, these curves are
really the same as the isoterms

00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:41.380
that we had for the
liquid gas system

00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:45.949
if I were to turn them
around by 90 degrees.

00:34:45.949 --> 00:34:51.420
The paramagnetic curve looks
very much topologically

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:57.240
like what we have for their
isoterm at high temperatures

00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.230
where the discontinuity
that we have

00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:03.440
for the magnetization
of the ferromagnet

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:08.130
looks like the isoterm that we
would have at low temperatures.

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:11.180
And indeed,
separating these two,

00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:15.810
there will be some kind
of a critical isoterm.

00:35:15.810 --> 00:35:20.120
So if I were to go
exactly down here,

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:25.630
you see what I would
get is a curve that

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:31.780
is kind of like this-- comes
and hogs the vertical axis

00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:36.650
and then does that,
which is in the sense

00:35:36.650 --> 00:35:41.100
that we were discussing
before identical to the curve

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:47.530
that you have for the isoterm
of the liquid gas coexistence.

00:35:47.530 --> 00:35:48.740
What do I mean?

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:53.040
I could do the same
type of collapse of data

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:54.710
that I showed you
before that I was

00:35:54.710 --> 00:35:57.030
doing for the coexistence curve.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:36:01.570
I can do that for these
inverted coexistence curves.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:05.900
I can do the same collapse
for this critical isoterm

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:07.660
of the ferromagnet.

00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:11.490
And it would fall on top
of the critical isoterm

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:16.700
that I would have for neon,
argon, krypton, anything else.

00:36:16.700 --> 00:36:19.970
So that is that kind of
overall universality.

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:28.098
Now-- yes?

00:36:28.098 --> 00:36:30.222
AUDIENCE: In this
[INAUDIBLE], why didn't you

00:36:30.222 --> 00:36:33.300
draw the full loop
of hysteresis?

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.780
PROFESSOR: Because I'm
interested at this point

00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.990
with equilibrium phenomena.

00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:41.050
Hysteresis is a non
equilibrium thing.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:45.670
So depending on how rapid you
cool things or not cool things,

00:36:45.670 --> 00:36:49.070
you will get larger curves--
larger hysteresis curves.

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:51.236
AUDIENCE: So what
would it have been

00:36:51.236 --> 00:36:54.364
if we had high-- wasn't
[INAUDIBLE] fields

00:36:54.364 --> 00:36:58.220
that were slowly reduce it to 0?

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:00.450
And then go a little
bit beyond and then

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:04.050
just stay in that
state for a long time?

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:04.650
Will the--

00:37:04.650 --> 00:37:05.274
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:37:05.274 --> 00:37:08.636
If you wait sufficiently
long time, which

00:37:08.636 --> 00:37:10.010
is the definition
of equilibrium,

00:37:10.010 --> 00:37:13.450
you would follow the
curve that I have drawn.

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:16.060
There would be-- so the
size of the hysteresis loop

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:21.180
will go down as the amount
of time that you wait.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.080
Except that in
order to see this,

00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.789
you may have to wait longer
than the age of the universe.

00:37:25.789 --> 00:37:26.330
I don't know.

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:30.644
But in principle, that's
what's going to happen.

00:37:30.644 --> 00:37:33.380
AUDIENCE: I have
a question here.

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:37.040
PROFESSOR: Yes

00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.200
AUDIENCE: When you create
the flat line for temperature

00:37:41.200 --> 00:37:42.627
below the critical one--

00:37:42.627 --> 00:37:43.210
PROFESSOR: Yes

00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:45.390
AUDIENCE: --are you
essentially doing

00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:47.180
sort of a Maxwell
construction again?

00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:51.840
Or is that too
much even for this?

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:52.480
PROFESSOR: No.

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.720
I mean, I haven't done
any theoretical work.

00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:57.920
At this point, I'm just
giving you observation.

00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:00.420
Once we start to
give theory, there

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.370
is a type of theory
for the magnet that

00:38:03.370 --> 00:38:06.140
is the analog of
Maxwell's construction

00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:10.210
that you would do for the
case of the liquid gas.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:14.730
Indeed, you will have that
as the first problem set.

00:38:14.730 --> 00:38:16.435
So you can figure
it out for yourself.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.430
Anything else?

00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:23.980
OK.

00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:29.830
So I kind of emphasized
that functional forms

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:32.720
are the things
that are universal.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.465
And so in the context
of the magnet,

00:38:35.465 --> 00:38:40.970
it is more clear
how to characterize

00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:43.090
these functional forms.

00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:47.010
So one of the things
that we have over here

00:38:47.010 --> 00:38:52.850
is that if I plot the true
equilibrium magnetization

00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:57.230
as a function of temperature
for fields that are 0--

00:38:57.230 --> 00:38:58.660
so H equals to 0.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:03.450
If I start along
the 0 field line,

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:09.230
then all the way up
to TC, magnetization

00:39:09.230 --> 00:39:12.180
at high temperatures
is of course 0.

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:13.830
You're dealing
with a paramagnet.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:16.090
By definition, it
has no magnetization.

00:39:16.090 --> 00:39:18.950
When you go below
TC, you'll have

00:39:18.950 --> 00:39:22.210
a system that is
spontaneously magnetized.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.500
Again, exactly
what that means is

00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:28.260
it needs a little
bit of clarification.

00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.810
Because it does depend on
the direction of your field.

00:39:31.810 --> 00:39:35.150
The magnitude of
it is well defined.

00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:38.230
If I go from H to
minus H, the sine of it

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.870
could potentially change.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:43.786
But the magnitude has
a form such as this.

00:39:43.786 --> 00:39:48.030
It is again very
similar, if you like,

00:39:48.030 --> 00:39:51.020
to half of that
co existence curve

00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:53.560
that we had for the liquid gas.

00:39:53.560 --> 00:40:00.180
And we look at the behavior
that you have in this vicinity.

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:04.630
And we find that is
well-described by a power law.

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:13.880
So we say that M as T goes
to TC for H equals to 0

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:20.630
is characterized or is
proportional to TC minus T

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:25.345
to an exponent that is
given the symbol beta.

00:40:29.370 --> 00:40:32.880
Now, sometimes you can't
write this as TC minus T

00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:35.220
to the-- make it dimension.

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:36.070
It doesn't matter.

00:40:36.070 --> 00:40:37.730
It's the same exponent.

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.950
Sometimes in order not to have
to write all of this thing

00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:44.440
again and again, you
call this small T.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.160
It's just that
reduced temperature

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.620
from the critical point.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:55.440
And so basically, what we
have is that T to the beta

00:40:55.440 --> 00:40:59.860
characterizes the singularity
of the coexistence line,

00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:04.030
the magnetization [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:04.030 --> 00:41:11.750
Now, rather then sitting
at H equals to 0,

00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:16.060
I could have sat exactly
at T equals to TC

00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:22.310
and merely H. So essentially,
this is the curve.

00:41:22.310 --> 00:41:23.850
I say that T equals to TC.

00:41:23.850 --> 00:41:26.340
This is the blue curve.

00:41:26.340 --> 00:41:31.300
We see that new blue has this
characteristic form that it

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.380
also comes to 0 not linearly.

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:39.902
So there is an exponent
that characterizes that.

00:41:39.902 --> 00:41:45.200
that again is typically
written as 1 over delta.

00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:50.260
So you can see that if I go
back to the critical isoterm

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.760
of the liquid gas system.

00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.080
For the liquid gas system,
I would conclude that, say,

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.630
delta v goes like delta P
to the power of delta or one

00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:04.870
goes with the other to
the power of 1 if it.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:10.680
So essentially, the
shapes of these two things

00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:12.757
are very much
related, characterized

00:42:12.757 --> 00:42:13.715
by these two exponents.

00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:19.405
What else?

00:42:23.890 --> 00:42:28.159
Another thing that we can
certainly measure for a magnet

00:42:28.159 --> 00:42:29.075
is the susceptibility.

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:41.130
So chi-- let's measure it
as a function of temperature

00:42:41.130 --> 00:42:44.960
but for field equal to 0.

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:51.370
So basically, I sit eventually
at the equals to TC.

00:42:51.370 --> 00:42:53.660
But I put on a
small magnetic field

00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:56.970
and see how the
magnetization changes.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:43:00.310
You can see that as
long as I am above TC

00:43:00.310 --> 00:43:05.430
in the paramagnetic phase, there
is a linear relationship here.

00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:11.060
Chi is proportional to H.
But the proportionality here

00:43:11.060 --> 00:43:12.990
is the susceptibility.

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:17.820
As I get closer to C, that
susceptibility diverges.

00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:23.820
OK, so chi is
proportional to T diverges

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:27.230
with an exponent that
is indicated by gamma.

00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:30.180
Actually, let me be a
little bit more precise.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:35.980
So what I have said is that
if I plot the susceptibility

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:41.800
as a function of temperature
at TC, it diverges.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:50.550
I could also calculate something
similar to that below TC.

00:43:50.550 --> 00:43:52.290
Below TC, it is
true that I already

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:54.626
have some magnetization.

00:43:54.626 --> 00:43:57.480
But if I put on
a magnetic field,

00:43:57.480 --> 00:44:00.580
the magnetization will go up.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.510
And I can define
the slope of that

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.920
as being the
susceptibility below TC.

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:11.302
And again, as I
approach TC from below,

00:44:11.302 --> 00:44:14.600
that susceptibility
also diverges.

00:44:14.600 --> 00:44:19.520
So there is a susceptibility
that comes like this.

00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.770
So you would say, OK.

00:44:21.770 --> 00:44:24.870
There's a susceptibility above.

00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:27.340
And there is a
susceptibility below.

00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:30.975
And maybe they diverge
with different exponents.

00:44:30.975 --> 00:44:34.100
at this point, we don't know.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:35.620
Yes or no.

00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:40.970
We will show shortly that
indeed the two gammas are really

00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:45.476
the same and using one exponent
is sufficient for that story.

00:44:49.050 --> 00:44:53.650
And analog of susceptibility
in the case of the liquid gas

00:44:53.650 --> 00:44:55.860
would be the compressibility.

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.740
And the compressibility
is related somehow

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.260
to the inverse of
these PV curve slopes.

00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:07.590
We know that the sign of it has
to be negative for stability.

00:45:07.590 --> 00:45:09.980
But right on the
critical isoterm,

00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:14.180
you see that this slope goes
to 0 or its inverse diverges.

00:45:14.180 --> 00:45:19.550
So there is, again, the same
exponent gamma for some magnets

00:45:19.550 --> 00:45:20.897
also describes that divergence.

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:28.340
Susceptibility is an example
of a response function.

00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:31.360
You perturb the system
and see how it responds.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.250
Another response
function that we've

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:39.780
seen is the heat capacity where
you put heat into this system

00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.560
or you try to change
the temperature

00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:44.350
and see how the heat
energy is modified.

00:45:47.330 --> 00:45:53.400
And again, we
experimentally observe.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:55.590
We already saw
something like this

00:45:55.590 --> 00:45:57.470
when we were discussing
the super fluid

00:45:57.470 --> 00:46:00.640
transition, the lambda
transition-- that the heat

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:06.700
capacity as a function of
temperature at some transition

00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:09.785
temperatures happens to diverge.

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:16.450
And in principle,
one can again look

00:46:16.450 --> 00:46:19.250
at the two sides
of the transition

00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:24.460
and characterize them by
divergences that are typically

00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.300
indicated by the exponent alpha.

00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.990
Again, you will see
that there are reasons

00:46:30.990 --> 00:46:34.980
why there is only one
exponent [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:39.310
So this is essentially
the only part

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.640
where there is some
zoology involved.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.330
You have to remember
and learn where

00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:47.990
the different
exponents come from.

00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:51.390
The rest of it, I hope, is
very logical-- but which

00:46:51.390 --> 00:46:54.139
one is alpha, which one's
beta, which one's gamma.

00:46:54.139 --> 00:46:56.472
There's four things, five
things you should [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.900
OK?

00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.320
Now, the next thing
that I want to do

00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:11.000
is to show you that the
two things that we looked

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.480
at about the liquid
gas transition--

00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:16.870
in fact, one of them
implies the other.

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:20.440
So we said that
essentially by continuity,

00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:24.040
when I look at the shape
of this critical isoterm,

00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:27.260
it come down in this zero slope.

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:30.530
When, again, to continuously
join the type of curve

00:47:30.530 --> 00:47:33.465
that I have for T greater
than TC of magnetization

00:47:33.465 --> 00:47:36.230
and T less than
TC below, I should

00:47:36.230 --> 00:47:39.750
have a curve that
comes and hogs the axis

00:47:39.750 --> 00:47:41.510
or has infinite susceptibility.

00:47:44.300 --> 00:47:48.220
I will show you that the
infinite susceptibility does,

00:47:48.220 --> 00:47:52.510
in fact imply, that you must
have collective behavior.

00:47:52.510 --> 00:47:56.130
That this critical
opalescence that we saw

00:47:56.130 --> 00:47:59.870
is inseparable from
the fact that you

00:47:59.870 --> 00:48:03.130
have diverging susceptibility.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:04.940
I'll show that in the
case of the magnet.

00:48:04.940 --> 00:48:09.110
But it also applies, of course,
to the critical opalescence.

00:48:09.110 --> 00:48:12.290
So let's do a little
bit of thermodynamics.

00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:18.770
So I can imagine if I have
some kind of Hamiltonia that

00:48:18.770 --> 00:48:23.810
describes my interactions
among the spins in my argon

00:48:23.810 --> 00:48:26.540
or any other magnet that I have.

00:48:26.540 --> 00:48:31.060
And if I was to calculate
a partition function, what

00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:34.170
I need to do would
be to trace over

00:48:34.170 --> 00:48:38.310
all degrees of freedom
of this system.

00:48:38.310 --> 00:48:41.600
Now, for the case of the
magnet, it is more convenient

00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:46.030
actually to look at the ensemble
that is corresponding to this.

00:48:46.030 --> 00:48:49.810
That is, fix the magnetic field
and allow the magnetization

00:48:49.810 --> 00:48:51.960
to decide where it wants to be.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.110
So I really want
to evaluate things

00:48:54.110 --> 00:48:58.560
in this ensemble, which
really to be precise,

00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:03.280
is not the [INAUDIBLE] ensemble,
but the Gibbs ensemble.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.180
So this should be a
Gibbs free energy.

00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:07.290
This should be a Gibbs
partition function.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:11.100
But traditionally, most
texts including my notes

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:13.750
ignore that difference
and log of this.

00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:16.380
Rather than calling
it G, we will call F.

00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:20.600
But that doesn't
make much difference.

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:25.760
This clearly is a function
of temperature and H.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:32.040
Now, if I wanted-- let's
imagine that always we

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:33.810
put the magnetic field
in one direction.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:35.932
So I don't have to
worry for the time being

00:49:35.932 --> 00:49:37.510
about vectorial aspect.

00:49:37.510 --> 00:49:40.670
When you go back to
the vectorial aspect

00:49:40.670 --> 00:49:44.050
later on, clearly--
actually this

00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:48.420
is the net magnetization
of the system.

00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.045
If I have a piece
of iron, it would

00:49:50.045 --> 00:49:53.770
be the magnetization
of the entire iron.

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:57.190
And the average of
that magnetization,

00:49:57.190 --> 00:50:00.040
given temperature
and field, et cetera,

00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:07.890
I can obtain by taking
the log z by D beta H.

00:50:07.890 --> 00:50:11.830
Because when I do that, I
go back inside the trace,

00:50:11.830 --> 00:50:13.890
take a derivative in
respect to beta H.

00:50:13.890 --> 00:50:23.410
And I have a trace of M into
the minus beta H plus beta HM,

00:50:23.410 --> 00:50:29.720
which is how the different
probabilities are rated once

00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:32.520
because of the log z.

00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:34.620
In a derivative,
I have a 1 over z

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:38.730
to make this more properly
normalized probabilities.

00:50:38.730 --> 00:50:40.510
So that's the standard story.

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:49.740
Now if I were to take
another derivative,

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:54.160
if I were to take
a derivative of M

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:59.320
with respect to H, which is
what the susceptibility is,

00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.770
after all.

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:02.790
So the sensitivity
of the system--

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:04.660
there is the derivative
of magnetization

00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.240
with respect to H.

00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:11.270
It is the same thing
as beta derivative

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:16.540
of M with respect to
beta H, of course.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.690
So I have to go to this
expression that I have on top

00:51:19.690 --> 00:51:23.260
and take another derivative
with respect to beta H.

00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:29.220
The derivative can act on beta
H that is in the numerator.

00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:32.850
And what that does is it
essentially brings down

00:51:32.850 --> 00:51:42.750
another factor of M. And
the Z is not touched.

00:51:42.750 --> 00:51:46.650
Or I leave the
numerator as is and take

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:49.105
a derivative of the denominator.

00:51:49.105 --> 00:51:53.090
And the derivative of
z I've already taken.

00:51:53.090 --> 00:51:55.635
So essentially, because
it's in the denominator,

00:51:55.635 --> 00:51:58.110
I will get the minus 1.

00:51:58.110 --> 00:52:01.810
The derivative of 1 over z
will become 1 over z squared.

00:52:01.810 --> 00:52:04.020
It will also give
me that fact factor

00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:07.350
that multiplies
that factor itself.

00:52:07.350 --> 00:52:13.120
So I have e to the minus
beta H plus beta HM.

00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:17.870
And this whole
thing got squared.

00:52:17.870 --> 00:52:19.800
OK?

00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:23.590
So a very famous
formula-- always true.

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:27.530
Response functions such
as susceptibilities

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:31.880
are related to
variances-- in this case,

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.153
variance of the
net magnetization

00:52:36.153 --> 00:52:41.910
of the system of course
true for other responses.

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:46.300
OK, this doesn't seem
to tell us very much.

00:52:46.300 --> 00:52:49.782
But then I note the following
that-- OK, so I have my magnet.

00:52:53.050 --> 00:52:58.560
What I have been asking is
what is the net magnetization

00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:02.410
of piece of magnet and
its response to adding

00:53:02.410 --> 00:53:05.150
a magnetic field.

00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:08.340
If I want to think
more microscopically--

00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.360
if I want to think,
go back in terms

00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.200
of what we saw
for the liquid gas

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.640
system and the
critical opalescence

00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:18.990
where there were fluctuations
in density all over the place,

00:53:18.990 --> 00:53:23.610
I expect that the reality also
at some particular instance,

00:53:23.610 --> 00:53:26.205
when I look at this,
there will be fluctuations

00:53:26.205 --> 00:53:29.190
in magnetization
from one location

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:32.410
of the sample to another
location of the sample.

00:53:32.410 --> 00:53:35.020
It's kind of building
gradually in the direction

00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:36.720
of the statistical field.

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:40.970
I kind of expect to have these
long wavelength fluctuations.

00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:42.220
And that's where I want to go.

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.530
But at this stage, I cannot
even worry about that.

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:48.150
I can say that I
define in whatever

00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:51.440
way some kind of a
local magnetization

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:56.090
so that the net magnetization,
let's say in V dimension,

00:53:56.090 --> 00:53:59.490
is the integrated version
of the local magnetization.

00:53:59.490 --> 00:54:02.150
So magnetization
density I integrate

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.582
with the net magnetization.

00:54:04.582 --> 00:54:07.480
OK, I put that over here.

00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:10.920
I have two factors
of big M. So I

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:17.520
will get two factors of
integration over R and R prime.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.380
Let's stick to three dimensions.

00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.170
Doesn't matter.

00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:24.120
We can generalize
it to be dimensions.

00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:30.930
And here I have M
of R, M of R prime.

00:54:30.930 --> 00:54:32.980
And average would
give me the average

00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:38.340
of this M of R
minus M of R prime.

00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.320
Whereas in the
second part, there

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:43.600
are the product of
two averages-- M

00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:49.680
and R, average of M and R prime.

00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.726
So it is the covariance.

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:58.662
So I basically have
to look at the M

00:54:58.662 --> 00:55:02.680
at some point in my sample,
the M at some other point R

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:06.780
prime in the sample,
calculate the covariance.

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:13.900
Now, on average,
this piece of iron

00:55:13.900 --> 00:55:19.070
doesn't know its left corner
from its right corner.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:21.540
So just as in the
case of the lattice,

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:26.380
I expect once I do the
averaging, on average, M of R,

00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:31.650
M of R prime should be only a
function of R minus R prime.

00:55:31.650 --> 00:55:35.580
All right, so I expect
this covariance that's

00:55:35.580 --> 00:55:43.840
indicated by MNC is really only
a function of the separation

00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:50.160
between the two points, OK?

00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:52.340
Which means that one
of these integrations

00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:53.565
I can indeed perform.

00:55:53.565 --> 00:55:55.320
There's the integral
with respect

00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.650
to the relative coordinate and
the center of mass coordinate.

00:55:58.650 --> 00:56:00.940
For getting boundary
dependence, this

00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:04.350
will give you a factor of V.
There was a factor of beta

00:56:04.350 --> 00:56:07.100
that I forgot.

00:56:07.100 --> 00:56:09.850
There is an overall beta.

00:56:09.850 --> 00:56:13.320
So I have chi beta.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:19.600
And then I have the integral
over the relative coordinate

00:56:19.600 --> 00:56:26.150
of the correlations
within two spins

00:56:26.150 --> 00:56:28.870
in the system as a
function of separation.

00:56:59.490 --> 00:57:02.230
Now, of course, like
any other quantity,

00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:05.450
susceptibility is proportional
to how much material you have.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:07.490
It's an extensive quantity.

00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:10.520
So when I say that the
susceptibility diverges,

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:12.730
I really mean that
the susceptibility

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:15.050
per unit volume--
the intensive part

00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:17.830
is the thing that will diverge.

00:57:17.830 --> 00:57:20.870
But the susceptibility
per unit volume

00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:26.280
is the result of doing an
integration of this covariance

00:57:26.280 --> 00:57:29.810
as a function of position.

00:57:29.810 --> 00:57:33.730
Let's see what we expect
this covariance to do.

00:57:33.730 --> 00:57:38.990
So as a function
of separation, if I

00:57:38.990 --> 00:57:45.640
look at the covariance
between two spins-- OK,

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:48.300
so there's this note
that I have already

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:50.330
subtracted out the average.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:52.470
So whether you are in
the ferromagnetic phase

00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:55.120
or in the paramagnetic
phase, the statement

00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:57.960
is how much is the
fluctuation around the average

00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.100
at this point and this
other point are related?

00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:03.620
Well, when the two points come
together, what I'm looking

00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:09.680
is some kind of a variance
of the randomness.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:12.610
Now, when I go further
and further away,

00:58:12.610 --> 00:58:15.750
I expect that
eventuality, what this

00:58:15.750 --> 00:58:18.595
does as far as a fluctuation
around the averages

00:58:18.595 --> 00:58:24.910
is concerned, does not influence
what is going on very far away.

00:58:24.910 --> 00:58:28.570
So I expect that as a function
of going further and further

00:58:28.570 --> 00:58:33.050
away, this is something
that will eventually

00:58:33.050 --> 00:58:34.345
die off and go to zero.

00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:40.650
Let's imagine that
there is some kind

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:44.660
of characteristic
landscape below which

00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:48.930
the correlations
have died off to 0.

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:51.570
And I will say
that this integral

00:58:51.570 --> 00:58:55.710
is less than or equal
to essentially looking

00:58:55.710 --> 00:59:00.030
at the volume over which
there are correlations.

00:59:00.030 --> 00:59:02.190
The correlations
within this volume

00:59:02.190 --> 00:59:05.670
would typically be less
than sigma squared.

00:59:05.670 --> 00:59:10.580
But let's bound it by sigma
squared times the volume

00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:12.300
that we're dealing
with, which is either

00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:15.400
four pi over 3c cubed.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.950
Coefficients here
are not important.

00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:27.200
OK, so if I know that
my response function

00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:30.930
per unit volume, like
my compressibility

00:59:30.930 --> 00:59:34.700
or susceptibility, if I
know that the left hand

00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:40.430
side as I go to TC is diverging
and going to infinity,

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:41.910
variance is bounded.

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:43.190
I can't do anything with it.

00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:44.540
Data is bounded.

00:59:44.540 --> 00:59:47.260
I can't do anything with this.

00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:50.390
The only thing that I
conclude, the only knob I have,

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:54.040
is that C must go to infinity.

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:59.600
So K over V going
to infinity implies

00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.420
and is implied by
this [INAUDIBLE].

01:00:09.310 --> 01:00:11.740
So I was actually
not quite truthful.

01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:15.580
Because you need to
learn one other exponent.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:18.520
So then how the
correlation then divergence

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:23.710
as a function of temperature
is also important

01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:31.700
and is indicated by an
exponent that is called nu.

01:00:31.700 --> 01:00:39.430
So C diverges as T to some
x point under this nu.

01:00:39.430 --> 01:00:42.860
So this is what you were
seeing when I was showing you

01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:44.870
the critical opalescence.

01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:47.970
The size of these
fluctuations became so large

01:00:47.970 --> 01:00:50.690
that you couldn't see
through the sample.

01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:54.570
All kinds of wavelengths were
taking place in the system.

01:00:54.570 --> 01:00:59.590
And if I had presented
things as square,

01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:01.500
I could have given you
that as a prediction.

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:04.320
I should have shown you,
say, the critical isoterm

01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.080
looks like this.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.220
Therefore, if you
look at it at TC,

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:10.090
you shouldn't be able
to see through it.

01:01:10.090 --> 01:01:11.450
This is [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:22.560
All right, so those
are the phenomena

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:26.810
that we would like
to now explain,

01:01:26.810 --> 01:01:29.670
phenomena being these
critical exponent

01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:33.450
alpha, beta, gamma, and nu,
et cetera, being universal

01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:36.880
and the same across very
many different systems.

01:01:39.826 --> 01:01:40.808
AUDIENCE: Question.

01:01:40.808 --> 01:01:41.790
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:01:41.790 --> 01:01:47.682
AUDIENCE: Is [INAUDIBLE] in
elementary fundamental field

01:01:47.682 --> 01:01:50.873
theory, like-- I mean,
like, in the standard model

01:01:50.873 --> 01:01:53.910
or in quantum field theory where
something like this happens

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:57.100
where there's-- I mean, it's
not a thermodynamical system.

01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:58.400
It's like elementary theory.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.770
And yet--

01:01:59.770 --> 01:02:02.200
PROFESSOR: Yep.

01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:07.800
In some sense, the masses
of the different particles

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.900
are like correlation lengths.

01:02:10.900 --> 01:02:13.280
Because it is the
mass of the particles

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:15.680
like in the nuclear
potential that

01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.040
describes the range
of the interactions.

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.270
So there are phenomena
such as the case

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:25.910
of [INAUDIBLE] or whatever
where the range is infinite.

01:02:25.910 --> 01:02:28.220
So in some sense,
those phenomena

01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.254
are sitting at the
critical point.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:56.020
OK, so the name of the
statistical field theory

01:02:56.020 --> 01:02:59.760
that we will construct
is Landau Ginzburg

01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:03.025
and originally constructed
by Landau in connection

01:03:03.025 --> 01:03:05.350
to super fluidity.

01:03:05.350 --> 01:03:16.510
But it can describe a lot of
different phase transitions.

01:03:23.310 --> 01:03:26.340
Let's roughly introduce
it in the context

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:28.880
of these magnetic systems.

01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:32.380
So basically, I have my magnet.

01:03:36.290 --> 01:03:41.340
And again, in principle,
I have all kinds

01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:43.500
of complicated
degrees of freedom

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.530
which are the spins that
have quantum mechanical

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:49.420
interactions, the exchange
interactions, whatever

01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:51.610
the result of the
behavior of electrons

01:03:51.610 --> 01:03:54.230
and their common
interactions with ions

01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:58.040
is that eventually,
something like nickel becomes

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:01.760
a ferromagnet at
low temperatures.

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:06.390
Now, hopefully and actually
precisely in the context

01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:08.350
that we are dealing
with, I don't

01:04:08.350 --> 01:04:11.480
need to know any of
all those details.

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:14.045
I will just focus
on the phenomena

01:04:14.045 --> 01:04:16.720
that there is a
system that undergoes

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.600
a transition between
ferromagnetic and paramagnetic

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.755
behavior and focus
on calculating

01:04:24.755 --> 01:04:28.380
an appropriate partition
function for the degrees

01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:32.080
of freedom that change their
behavior ongoing through TC.

01:04:34.770 --> 01:04:39.140
So what I expect is
that again, just like we

01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:42.380
saw for the case of
liquid gas system,

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.490
on one side for
the magnet, there

01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:48.825
will be an average
zero magnetization

01:04:48.825 --> 01:04:50.160
in the paramagnet.

01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:53.690
But there will be
fluctuations of magnetization,

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:56.280
presumably with
long wavelengths.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:59.840
On the other side, there
will be these fluctuations

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.430
on top of some average
magnetization that

01:05:02.430 --> 01:05:04.790
has formed in the system.

01:05:04.790 --> 01:05:08.870
And if I stick
sufficiently close to TC,

01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:11.210
I expect that that
magnetization is small.

01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:13.290
That's where the
exponent beta comes from.

01:05:13.290 --> 01:05:15.820
So if I go sufficiently
close to TC,

01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:19.870
these new Ms that I have
at each location hopefully

01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:21.310
will not be very big.

01:05:21.310 --> 01:05:25.360
So maybe in the same sense that
when I was doing elasticity

01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:27.380
by going to low
temperature, I could

01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:29.500
look at small deformations.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.932
By sticking in the
vicinity of TC,

01:05:31.932 --> 01:05:36.430
I can look at small
magnetization fluctuations.

01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:39.990
So what I want to
do is to imagine

01:05:39.990 --> 01:05:46.500
that within my system that
has lots and lots of electrons

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:49.860
and other microscopic
degrees of freedom,

01:05:49.860 --> 01:05:55.350
I can focus on regions
that I average.

01:05:55.350 --> 01:05:57.275
And with each region
that I average,

01:05:57.275 --> 01:06:00.940
I associate magnetization
as a function

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:05.360
of position, which is
a statistical field

01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:14.740
in the same sense
that displacement was.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:26.370
See, over here, I will
write this quantity--

01:06:26.370 --> 01:06:29.800
the analog of the
U-- in fact by using

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.930
two different vectorial
symbols for reasons

01:06:34.930 --> 01:06:39.390
that will become obvious
shortly, hopefully.

01:06:39.390 --> 01:06:44.380
Because I would like to have
the possibility of having

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:52.730
R to describe systems
that live in D dimensions

01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:56.380
where D would be one if
I'm dealing with a wire.

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.750
D would be two if I'm
dealing with a flat plane.

01:06:59.750 --> 01:07:02.160
D equals to three in
three dimensional space.

01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:06.260
Maybe there's some relationship
to relativistic field theories

01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:10.520
where we would be
four for space time.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:15.480
But M I will allowed to
be something else that

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:20.030
has components M1, M2, Mn.

01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:29.120
And we've already seen two
cases where n is either 1 or 3.

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:34.120
Clearly, if I'm thinking about
the case of a ferromagnet,

01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.850
then there are three components
of the magnetization.

01:07:36.850 --> 01:07:38.640
N has to three.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.400
But then if I'm looking
at the analogous

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:44.300
thing for the liquid
gas system, the thing

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.460
that distinguishes
different locations

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:48.990
is the density--
density fluctuations.

01:07:48.990 --> 01:07:51.060
And that's a scalar quantity.

01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:54.520
So that corresponds
to N equals to 1.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:58.610
There's other-- then we are
dealing with super fluidity

01:07:58.610 --> 01:08:04.230
where what we are leaving it
is a quantum mechanical object

01:08:04.230 --> 01:08:07.230
that has a phase
and an amplitude.

01:08:07.230 --> 01:08:10.510
It has an x component-- real
and imaginary component that

01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:13.130
corresponds to n equals to 2.

01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:17.020
Again, n equals to 1
would describe something

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.180
like liquid gas.

01:08:19.180 --> 01:08:24.770
N equals to 3 would correspond
to something like a magnet.

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:27.310
And there's actually no
relationship between n

01:08:27.310 --> 01:08:30.130
and v. N could be larger than 3.

01:08:30.130 --> 01:08:33.340
So imagine that you take a wire.

01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:36.960
So x is clearly one-dimensional.

01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:40.160
But along the wire, you
put three component spins.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:42.770
So N could still be true.

01:08:42.770 --> 01:08:49.350
So we can discuss a whole
bunch of different quantities

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:55.056
at the same time by generalizing
our picture of the magnet

01:08:55.056 --> 01:09:00.479
to have n component and
existing D dimensions.

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:02.370
OK?

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:06.529
Now, the thing that I
would like to construct

01:09:06.529 --> 01:09:10.640
is that I look at my system.

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.510
And I characterize it by
different configurations

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:17.960
of this field M of
R. And if I have

01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:22.250
many examples of the same
system at the same temperature,

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:24.850
I will have different
realizations

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:27.210
of that statistical field.

01:09:27.210 --> 01:09:29.550
I can assign the
different realizations

01:09:29.550 --> 01:09:35.040
some kind of weight of
probability, if you like.

01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:38.840
And what I would
like to do is to have

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:42.580
an idea of what the
weight of probability

01:09:42.580 --> 01:09:46.479
of different configurations is.

01:09:46.479 --> 01:09:50.900
Just because I have a background
in statistical mechanics,

01:09:50.900 --> 01:09:54.680
in statistical mechanics, we
are used to [INAUDIBLE] weight.

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.744
So we take the log of
weight of probabilities

01:09:58.744 --> 01:10:00.860
and call them some kind
of effective Hamiltonian.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:12.850
And this effective
Hamiltonian is

01:10:12.850 --> 01:10:16.520
distinct from a true
microscoping Hamiltonian

01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:19.900
that describes the system.

01:10:19.900 --> 01:10:21.820
And it's just a
way of describing

01:10:21.820 --> 01:10:24.620
what the logarithm
of the probability

01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:28.560
for the different
configurations is [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:29.310
Say, well, OK.

01:10:29.310 --> 01:10:32.440
How do you go and
construct this?

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.360
Well, I say, OK.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:41.820
Presumably, there is really some
true microscopic Hamiltonia.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:44.800
And I can take whatever
that microscopic Hamiltonia

01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:48.880
is that has all of my
degrees of freedom.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:52.110
And then for a
particular configuration,

01:10:52.110 --> 01:10:58.106
I know what the probability of
a true microscopic configuration

01:10:58.106 --> 01:10:58.606
is.

01:11:01.320 --> 01:11:05.780
Presumably, what I did
was to obtain my M of R

01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:13.980
by somehow averaging over these
other two degrees of freedom.

01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.960
So the construction to go
from the true microscopic

01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:22.510
probabilities to
this effective weight

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:25.300
is just a change of variable.

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:29.825
I have to specify some
configuration M of R

01:11:29.825 --> 01:11:32.060
in my system.

01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:35.400
That configuration
of M of R will

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:40.780
be consistent with a huge number
of microscopic configurations.

01:11:40.780 --> 01:11:42.560
I know what the
weight of each one

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:45.390
of those microscopic
configurations is.

01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:47.890
I sum over all of them.

01:11:47.890 --> 01:11:50.370
And I have this.

01:11:50.370 --> 01:11:52.840
Now, of course, if
I could do that,

01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:54.880
I would immediately
solve the full problem

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.880
and I wouldn't need to
have to deal with this.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:12:00.720
Clearly, I can't do that.

01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:04.250
But I can guess what the
eventual form of this

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:07.920
is in the same
way that I guessed

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:11.150
what the form of the statistical
field theory for elasticity

01:12:11.150 --> 01:12:14.450
was just by looking at
symmetries and things

01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:17.220
like that, OK?

01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:34.750
So in principle, W from
change of variables starting

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:48.989
from into the minus beta H
in practice from symmetries

01:12:48.989 --> 01:12:52.210
and a variety of other
statements and constraints

01:12:52.210 --> 01:12:55.516
that I would tell you about.

01:12:55.516 --> 01:12:58.462
Actually, let's keep this.

01:12:58.462 --> 01:13:00.426
And let's illuminate this.

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.860
OK.

01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:25.090
So there is beta H,
which is a function of M

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:27.060
as a function of this vector x.

01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:33.000
First thing that
I will do is what

01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.600
I did for the case
of elasticity, which

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:44.730
is to write the answer
as an integral in D

01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:52.450
dimensions of some kind of
a density at location x.

01:13:52.450 --> 01:13:59.700
So this is the same
locality type of constraint

01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:06.920
that we were discussing before
and has some caveats associated

01:14:06.920 --> 01:14:08.910
with that.

01:14:08.910 --> 01:14:13.250
This is going to be a
function of the variable

01:14:13.250 --> 01:14:16.290
at that location x.

01:14:16.290 --> 01:14:18.540
So that's the field.

01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:21.385
But I will also allow
various derivatives

01:14:21.385 --> 01:14:28.250
to appear so that I go beyond
just single [INAUDIBLE]

01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:30.730
will just give me
independent things happening

01:14:30.730 --> 01:14:35.250
at each location by allowing
some kind of connections

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:36.860
in a neighborhood.

01:14:36.860 --> 01:14:41.010
And if I go and recruit higher
and higher order derivatives,

01:14:41.010 --> 01:14:45.000
naturally I would
have more pips.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.600
Somebody was asking me--
you were asking me last time

01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.080
in principle, if the
system is something

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:56.450
that varies from one
position to another position,

01:14:56.450 --> 01:15:01.010
the very function itself
would depend on x.

01:15:01.010 --> 01:15:07.100
But if we assume that
the system is uniform,

01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:10.150
then we can drop that force.

01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:25.720
So to be precise, let's do this
for the case of five 0 field.

01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:29.620
Because when you are at
zero field in a magnet,

01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:33.420
the different directions of
space are all the same to you.

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:36.230
There's no reason to be pointing
one direction as opposed

01:15:36.230 --> 01:15:38.060
to another direction.

01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:50.730
So because of this symmetry in
rotations, in this function,

01:15:50.730 --> 01:15:54.420
you cannot have M-- actually,
you couldn't have M for other

01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:55.290
reasons.

01:15:55.290 --> 01:15:57.020
Well, OK.

01:15:57.020 --> 01:16:00.170
You couldn't have M because it
would break the directionality.

01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:07.640
But you could have
something that is M squared.

01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:13.815
Again, to be precise, M
squared is some, let's say,

01:16:13.815 --> 01:16:18.250
alpha running from 1 to n and
alpha of x and alpha of x.

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:28.880
Now, if the different directions
in space are the same,

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:31.990
then I can't have a
gradient appearing by itself

01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:34.630
because it would pick
a particular direction.

01:16:34.630 --> 01:16:38.030
In the same sense
that M squared,

01:16:38.030 --> 01:16:40.745
two Ms have to be
appearing together,

01:16:40.745 --> 01:16:43.170
if the different
directions in space

01:16:43.170 --> 01:16:46.580
forward and backward are
to be treated the same,

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:51.452
I have to have gradients
appearing together

01:16:51.452 --> 01:16:52.440
in powers of two.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.190
So there's a term that,
before doing that,

01:16:56.190 --> 01:16:59.480
let's say also sometimes
I will write something

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.880
that is M to the fourth.

01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:10.280
M to the fourth is really
this quantity M dot M squared.

01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:16.340
If I write M to the
sixth, it is M dot n.

01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:18.780
Mute and so forth--
so there's all kinds

01:17:18.780 --> 01:17:21.990
of terms such as that can
be appearing in this series.

01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:26.400
Gradients-- there's a term
that I will write symbolically

01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:29.770
as gradient of M square.

01:17:29.770 --> 01:17:38.820
And by that, I mean to we
take a derivative of n alpha

01:17:38.820 --> 01:17:43.660
with respect to
the alt component

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:51.200
and then repeat
the same thing sum

01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:54.310
wrote over both alpha and alt.

01:17:54.310 --> 01:17:56.130
So that would be the gradient.

01:17:56.130 --> 01:18:01.050
So basically, the
xi appears twice.

01:18:01.050 --> 01:18:03.830
M alpha appears twice.

01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:07.660
And you can go and construct
higher and higher order terms

01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:12.380
and derivatives, again
ensuring that each index

01:18:12.380 --> 01:18:18.240
both on the side of the position
x and the side of the fields M

01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.199
is a repeated index to
respect the symmetries that

01:18:21.199 --> 01:18:21.740
are involved.

01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:34.310
So if we-- there is actually
maybe one other thing

01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:43.200
to think about, which
is that again like

01:18:43.200 --> 01:18:48.460
before, I assume that I can make
an analytical expansion in M.

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:50.852
And who says you
are allowed to do

01:18:50.852 --> 01:18:53.480
an analytical expansion in M?

01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:56.260
Again, the key to
that is the averaging

01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:59.110
that we have to
do in the process.

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:05.260
And I want you to think back
to the central limit theorem.

01:19:05.260 --> 01:19:09.380
Let's imagine that there
is a variable x where

01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:15.430
the probability of
selecting that variable x

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:18.220
is actually kind of singular.

01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.130
Maybe it is something
like e to the minus x

01:19:21.130 --> 01:19:23.550
that is a discontinuity.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:28.340
Maybe it even has an integrable
divergence at some point.

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.642
Maybe it has additional
delta function.

01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:35.480
All kinds of-- it's a very
complicated, singular type

01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:38.160
of a function.

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.590
Now, I tell you-- add
thousands of these variables

01:19:41.590 --> 01:19:46.390
together and tell me what the
distribution of the sum is.

01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:49.550
And the distribution of the sum,
because of the central limit

01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:53.580
theorem, you know
has to look Gaussian.

01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:59.200
So then take its log, it has
a nice analytical expansion.

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:03.660
So the point is that
again, part of the course

01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:07.920
grading that we did to get from
whatever microscopic degrees

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.680
of freedom that we
have, to reaching

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:13.350
the level of this
effective field theory,

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.870
we added many
variables together.

01:20:15.870 --> 01:20:18.320
And because of the
central limit theorem,

01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:21.615
I have a lot of confidence
that quite generically,

01:20:21.615 --> 01:20:25.410
I can make an analytical
expansion such as this.

01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:27.590
But I have not.

01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:31.540
So having done all
of this, you would

01:20:31.540 --> 01:20:40.550
say that in order to describe
this magnet, what we need

01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:45.150
is to evaluate the
partition function,

01:20:45.150 --> 01:20:50.970
let's say, as a
function of temperature,

01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:55.430
which if I had
enormous power, I would

01:20:55.430 --> 01:21:01.190
do by trace of into
the beta H microscopic.

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:04.950
But what I have done
is I have subdivided

01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:09.690
different configurations of
microscopic degrees of freedom

01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:13.590
to different configurations of
this effective magnetization.

01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:19.965
And so essentially, that sum
is the same as integrating over

01:21:19.965 --> 01:21:23.231
all configurations of this
constrained magnetization

01:21:23.231 --> 01:21:23.730
field.

01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:30.810
And the probabilities
of these configurations

01:21:30.810 --> 01:21:35.400
of the magnetization field are
exponential of this minus data

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.290
H that I'm constructing
on the basis of principles

01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:43.180
that I told you-- principles
where that I first of all

01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:45.270
have a locality.

01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:49.330
I have an integrality of x.

01:21:49.330 --> 01:21:51.320
And then I have to
write terms that

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:54.270
are consistent
with the symmetry.

01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:57.140
First term that we saw that is
consistent with the symmetry

01:21:57.140 --> 01:22:00.050
is this M squared.

01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:02.290
And let's give a name
to its coefficient.

01:22:02.290 --> 01:22:06.490
Just like the coefficient of
elasticity, I put it nu over 2.

01:22:06.490 --> 01:22:10.050
Let's get here a T over 2.

01:22:10.050 --> 01:22:11.840
There will be
higher order terms.

01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.580
There will be M to the fourth.

01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:15.046
There will be M to the sixth.

01:22:15.046 --> 01:22:17.170
There will be a whole bunch
of things in principle.

01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:22.280
There will be gradient
types of terms.

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:27.079
So there will be K over
2, gradient of M squared.

01:22:27.079 --> 01:22:31.160
There will be L over 2
Laplacian of M squared.

01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:33.600
There would be higher
order terms that

01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:37.070
involve multiplying M's
and various gradient

01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:40.460
of M, et cetera.

01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:42.590
And actually, in
principle, there

01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:44.240
could be an overall constant.

01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:48.280
So there could be up here
some overall constant

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:56.790
of integration-- let's call
it beta F0-- which depends

01:22:56.790 --> 01:23:00.530
on temperature and so
forth but has nothing

01:23:00.530 --> 01:23:04.970
to do with the ordering of these
magnetization type of degrees

01:23:04.970 --> 01:23:07.140
of freedom.

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:13.230
Actually, if I imagine that I go
slightly away from the H equals

01:23:13.230 --> 01:23:17.610
to 0 axis, just I did
before, I will add here

01:23:17.610 --> 01:23:27.260
a term minus beta H of M and
evaluate this whole thing.

01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:30.638
So this is the
Landau-Ginzberg theory.

01:23:36.570 --> 01:23:40.600
In principle, you have to put
a lot of terms in the series.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:45.360
Our task would be to
show you quite rigorously

01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.730
that just a few
terms in the series

01:23:47.730 --> 01:23:50.730
aren't enough just as in the
case of theory of vibration

01:23:50.730 --> 01:23:52.790
for small enough vibration.

01:23:52.790 --> 01:23:55.680
In this case, the analog
of small enough vibration

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:58.910
is to be close enough to
the critical point, exactly

01:23:58.910 --> 01:24:02.720
where we want to calculate
these universal exponents

01:24:02.720 --> 01:24:06.030
and to then calculate the
universal exponents, which

01:24:06.030 --> 01:24:07.990
will turn out to
be a hard problem

01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:11.836
that we will struggle with
in the next many lectures.

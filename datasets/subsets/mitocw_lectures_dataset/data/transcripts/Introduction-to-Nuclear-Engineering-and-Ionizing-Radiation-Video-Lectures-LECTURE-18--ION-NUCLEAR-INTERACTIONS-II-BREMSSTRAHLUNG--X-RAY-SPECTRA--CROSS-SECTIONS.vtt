00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:22.940
MIKE SHORT: All right.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.040
So I am super
excited about today

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.870
because this is, in my
opinion, the highest

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.060
point of the apex of
the course where we're

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.640
going to put together
everything you've done so far

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.400
and start to explain things
like Bremsstrahlung, radiation

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.430
damage, X-ray spectra that
you get in a scanning electron

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.700
microscope, and actually find
a way where cross-sections

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.558
are areas.

00:00:42.558 --> 00:00:44.600
Remember before, I told
you guys cross-section is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.910
measured in barns, in
centimeters squared?

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.425
Think of it kind
of like an area.

00:00:48.425 --> 00:00:50.300
We'll actually be able
to show mathematically

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.820
that some of them do
derive from actual areas.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.900
So it will make
a lot more sense.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.630
It's not just an
abstract concept.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.990
What I want to do
is a quick review

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.010
of the ionization and
excitation collisions

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.000
that we did last time.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:13.070
Remember we had this imaginary
hollow cylinder where

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.440
we said that there
is some ion traveling

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.590
in this direction with
charge, let's say,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:21.800
z times the electron
charge and it's colliding,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.810
kind of, with an electron
somewhere else separated

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.840
by some impact parameter b.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.730
And let's say this
hollow cylinder

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.780
head a shell of thickness db.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.820
And we started off
with this situation

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.680
where we wanted to say--

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.570
we can find the y momentum as
the integral of the y force.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.450
We did something.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:48.830
And one of the
intermediate steps

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.270
we came up with was that our
energy in part of the electron

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.740
is p squared over 2 times mass
of the electron, which came out

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.360
to 2z squared e to the 4th
over the mass of the electron

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.050
impact parameter squared
velocity squared.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.220
Then we multiplied by
the electron density

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.770
in the material, which was the
number density of atoms times

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.740
z, the number of
electrons per atom,

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.580
times the area, the
cross-sectional area

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.710
of this hollow cylindrical
shell, which came out

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.740
to 2 pi b, which is the
circumference of that circle

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.270
right there, times db dx.

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.150
I'm just going to leave
that there for now,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.723
and we'll come back
to it in a second.

00:02:44.723 --> 00:02:46.390
I will mention, though,
that at the end,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.940
we came up with our
stopping power expression.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.500
Let's call this
ionizations that came out

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.360
to 4 pi, this constant
k0 squared, which

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.940
comes from the Coulomb force
law, little z squared, big Z, e

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.796
to the 4th over mass of the
electron velocity squared--

00:03:11.796 --> 00:03:13.500
I'm running out of room--

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.730
times log of mass of
the electron v squared

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.680
over this mean
excitation energy, which

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.840
comes out to around,
let's say, 10

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.780
to 19 electron volts times z.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.320
And what this meant was that
if we graph stopping power

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:47.380
as a function of energy, there's
a couple components to it.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.400
One of them is this roughly
1 over energy component.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.550
So let's say there's
a component of it--

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.260
yes, I love when I can do that--

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.260
that actually-- that
follows 1 over e.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.060
And there's this logarithmic
component that goes that way.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:10.350
And if we sum them together,
we ended up with a much higher

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:11.910
stopping power at low energies.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.029
But around this local
minimum of about 3 times

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.240
the mass of the
electron c squared,

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.279
it starts to increase again.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:22.180
And that's due to this.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.870
How many excitations can you
make as a function of energy?

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.070
So if you think about it, this
is kind of like an energy term.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.850
How much energy do you have
divided by how many ionizations

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.380
can you make?

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.853
So it's kind of an intuitive
result in that it's

00:04:36.853 --> 00:04:39.270
how much energy you've got
versus how much energy it takes

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.220
for a single unit process.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.083
And that's all mediated
by this 1 over e term.

00:04:44.083 --> 00:04:45.750
The last thing that
we said is that this

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.170
curves back down here.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:56.320
And that's because at around
500 times this mean excitation

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.280
energy, which as you can see
is around 1 keV times z--

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.250
it's not a very high energy--

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.834
you start to get
charged neutralization.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:15.410
The reason for that is that
for-- in order for this formula

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.920
to work, we have to assume
that the deflection is really,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.010
really, really small,
infinitesimally small.

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:27.560
If it's not, and if the ion
manages to catch that electron,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.720
it's not going to lose energy
by undergoing a Coulomb

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:33.283
interaction.

00:05:33.283 --> 00:05:35.450
It's going to lose energy
by absorbing that electron

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:36.710
and neutralizing.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.260
And so for really
low energy, the ions

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.200
are moving so slowly
that they can capture

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.200
some of those electrons.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.560
And it gets less and less
effective at stopping

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.960
the material.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.190
And this led to--

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:52.210
let's see-- this,
we're distance,

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:58.550
and this, we're dt dx
times the energy required

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.980
to make an ion pair, which
we'll just call this i.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.393
We ended up with a curve that
looked something like this.

00:06:07.393 --> 00:06:08.810
This right here
we call the range.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.400
We just gave that the symbol r.

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:15.840
So that's the
review of last time,

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.870
but I left some extra space for
some reasons which will become

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.560
clear in about half an hour.

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.200
Right now I want to take
you through a little bit

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.030
of a whirlwind in terms
of Bremsstrahlung.

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.040
I'm not going to derive
anything about it.

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:32.310
We're just going to go over what
the cross-sections and stopping

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.470
powers look like, why they
take that form intuitively.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.160
But we're not going to go
through a rigorous derivation

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.920
because, well, we
simply don't have time.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.350
But I do want you to know
what sort of things exist.

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:46.786
So for Bremsstrahlung, better
known as braking radiation--

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.170
who's actually heard
of this before?

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.440
Does anyone know roughly--

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.120
let's say if we were to
say some cross-section

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:04.140
for Bremsstrahlung.

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:07.290
Let's call it
cross-section radiative.

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.210
Because in this
case, we're actually

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.570
talking about the charged
particle radiating away

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.240
photons.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:18.060
So let's say we had some
nucleus of charge big Z,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:20.990
and we had some ion--

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.430
we'll look at a
different color--

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.950
some ion of charge little
Z moving towards it.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.330
It will either be
attracted or repelled

00:07:30.330 --> 00:07:32.760
depending on what
the sign looks like.

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.405
And sometimes you might
get radiation of a photon.

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:44.650
Let's call it of energy
E equals hc over lambda.

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.500
That'll become
important in a sec.

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.688
So this radiative
cross-section--

00:07:51.997 --> 00:07:53.580
I don't care about--
particularly care

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:56.700
about the exact form, but
what is it proportional to?

00:07:56.700 --> 00:07:58.140
What sort of
factors do you think

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:02.370
would make the emission of that
photon more or less likely?

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.200
Yeah?

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.320
AUDIENCE: The energy of
the charged particle.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.528
MIKE SHORT: Sure, the energy
of the charged particle.

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:09.870
So you can-- there's one
expression I like you.

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:12.060
Can only take my money
until you take it all.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.340
Well, the same thing goes
for the energy of a photon.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:18.198
You can't radiate any
more than the energy

00:08:18.198 --> 00:08:19.740
of the particle
coming in, so there's

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:24.760
going to be some
maximum energy which

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.020
is going to correspond to
some minimum wavelength, which

00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:32.380
is-- let's say if we just put
our initial energy in here,

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:36.090
that gives us our minimum
wavelength right there.

00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:43.179
That's true.

00:08:43.179 --> 00:08:46.810
And it can radiate at any
energy smaller than that

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:48.700
or any wavelength
larger than that.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:50.710
I'm basically saying
the same thing.

00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:53.170
Because if this particle
started off further away

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:58.450
and felt less of a deflection,
it could still emit a photon,

00:08:58.450 --> 00:09:00.918
but of a longer wavelength.

00:09:00.918 --> 00:09:02.710
Don't have room to draw
enough wavelengths,

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.660
but I want to make sure
that's physically accurate.

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.600
So it's actually going
to be also proportional

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.990
to z of the large nucleus.

00:09:10.990 --> 00:09:14.027
The stronger the pull, the
more of that breaking radiation

00:09:14.027 --> 00:09:14.860
you're going to see.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:18.370
It's actually
proportional to z squared.

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:22.360
What this says is that heavier
z materials produce a lot more

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.560
of this breaking radiation.

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:28.120
And it's also proportional
to the inverse

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.950
of the mass squared.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:33.220
What this says intuitively is
a heavier particle deflects

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.390
less and emits less of
this breaking radiation.

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:40.480
Hopefully this makes a
lot of sense to you guys,

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.672
that the stronger the pull
of the nucleus, the more

00:09:42.672 --> 00:09:45.130
deflection you're going to get,
and the more Bremsstrahlung

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.330
you'll get.

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:48.490
The larger the mass
of the incoming ion--

00:09:48.490 --> 00:09:51.000
let's say that's mass m--

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.290
the less deflection you'll
get because the less--

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:54.790
what is it?

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:58.270
The less momentum transfer you
can apply with the same force

00:09:58.270 --> 00:10:01.582
if you've got a
heavier particle.

00:10:01.582 --> 00:10:04.040
Does this make
sense to everybody?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:11.270
So what this says is it's really
important for high z materials.

00:10:14.208 --> 00:10:15.500
And we'll see a little bit why.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.963
If I actually write the full
expression for stopping power--

00:10:19.963 --> 00:10:21.380
and I promise to
you I'm not going

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.270
to derive it because we don't
really have the time for that.

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:28.880
It's proportional to
the number density.

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.130
You should always think there
will be a number density

00:10:31.130 --> 00:10:33.347
and stopping power, because
the more atoms there are,

00:10:33.347 --> 00:10:34.430
the more they stop things.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:36.410
It's just directly proportional.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:40.860
Times that kinetic
energy plus mec squared.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:43.400
And again, this is not something
I want you to memorize,

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.900
but it is something
I want you to be

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:49.040
able to decompose and explain
why the parts are there.

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.580
Let's see.

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:56.320
Times some radiative
cross-section

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:04.550
where this sigma radiative is
some constant cross-section.

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:12.730
This ends up being about
1/500 barns times z squared

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:16.570
times this parameter b, which
if you see in the reading

00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:18.340
is actually given just--

00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:22.810
this b scales roughly
with the atomic--

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:26.500
I'm sorry-- yeah, with the
proton number of the material.

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:29.500
So you can see that in
here, in the stopping power

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.090
is actually directly
the cross-section.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.140
So the components of
a stopping power--

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:44.320
there's going to be some
probability of interaction,

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.190
and there's going to be
some energy transfer part.

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:53.612
This is an interesting
result to show.

00:11:53.612 --> 00:11:55.820
This is why I wanted to just
write the Bremsstrahlung

00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:57.050
stopping power.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.360
Because in here, actually,
is the cross-section

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.940
times some other stuff.

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.400
Pretty neat result.
And so now I want

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.860
to show you how our
cross-section is actually

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.233
contained in the
ionization stopping power.

00:12:10.233 --> 00:12:11.900
So let's bring this
back down for a sec.

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:18.080
You can think of the likelihood
that the ion comes off

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.070
with any particular energy
to be directly related

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:23.810
to this impact parameter.

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:27.170
Because as we saw, the final
expression for stopping power

00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:30.200
is directly related
to this parameter b.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:32.990
We ended up integrating
over all possible b

00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:36.020
to get the total stopping
power in the material.

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:37.640
But if we didn't
do that integral--

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:40.940
if we stopped, let's say,
at this stage in the game,

00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:43.610
and we said, all right,
well, the stopping power

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:49.070
at some fixed b actually
depends on the probability

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:53.630
that that particle enters into
this cross-sectional area right

00:12:53.630 --> 00:13:00.200
here, this 2 pi b db,
that right there is

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.720
the cross-section for
scattering as a function

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:06.990
of the incoming energy
and the outgoing energy.

00:13:06.990 --> 00:13:08.740
This is one of the
coolest parts, I think,

00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.540
is that there is an
actual area right here.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:15.250
It's the area of a hollow circle
is the actual cross-section

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:18.995
for scattering with a
given ingoing and outgoing,

00:13:18.995 --> 00:13:21.150
outcoming energy.

00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:24.090
And then the rest
of this stuff--

00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:27.210
if you pull all this together,
if you take a microscopic

00:13:27.210 --> 00:13:30.420
cross-section times the number
of particles that are there--

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:39.720
because this is your
atomic number density,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:45.810
and these two together are
your electron number density.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:48.000
Like we talked about
before with reaction rates

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.800
and cross-sections,
this thing right

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.630
here is your macroscopic
cross-section for an incoming

00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:59.500
and an outgoing energy contained
directly in the stopping power

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:01.420
formula, because
then we integrated

00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.240
over all possible
cross sections, which

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:07.960
means all possible outgoing
energies for a given

00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.270
incoming energy.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.660
And so the last bit, the way
to link these two together,

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.860
which is why I left a little
bit of space right here--

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:20.805
we know right now, because
I wrote it up there,

00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:22.180
that the scattering
cross-section

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:29.890
as a function of the ingoing an
outgoing energy per unit energy

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:34.555
is just the area of
that hollow circle.

00:14:34.555 --> 00:14:38.500
So let's divide
everything by dt.

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:41.230
We end up with the total
formula for cross--

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.050
for the scattering
cross-section.

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:46.970
We don't know what
this b db dt is.

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.810
What's the differential
probability

00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:52.240
between impact parameter
and outgoing energy?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.020
We don't quite know,
but we can express this

00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:58.930
as a change of variables
that we do know.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:04.480
We do know-- if we have a
certain impact parameter,

00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:06.670
we know what the scattering
angle is going to be.

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:08.860
There is a well-known
relation for that.

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.290
And there's a
derivation in the book

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:14.290
and in another book that
I want to point out to you

00:15:14.290 --> 00:15:19.810
guys by Gary Was called
Fundamentals of Radiation

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:27.360
Material Science on page 32.

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.700
If anyone wants to see
the derivation from which

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.940
this result came from,
you can head right there,

00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:35.490
and it's free on MIT Libraries.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:39.060
Meanwhile, we do know our
relation between this impact

00:15:39.060 --> 00:15:41.490
parameter and the
angle, and we do

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:46.855
know a relation between this
angle and the outgoing energy.

00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:49.230
And this is where some of the
hard sphere collision stuff

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:51.640
comes in.

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:54.790
What's the maximum
amount of energy

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:57.580
that a particle can
impart to another particle

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:01.690
in some sort of a hard,
sphere-like collision?

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:02.900
Let's take the easy example.

00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:05.680
If the two particles
have equal mass,

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:09.617
how much energy can one
particle impart to another?

00:16:09.617 --> 00:16:10.450
AUDIENCE: All of it.

00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.658
MIKE SHORT: All of it, right?

00:16:11.658 --> 00:16:13.390
It can impart a
maximum of, let's say,

00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:16.150
this incoming energy ei.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.730
As those mass ratios change,
you can impart a maximum--

00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.400
let's say your
maximum becomes what's

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:30.880
called gamma ei where
this gamma right here

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:35.950
is 4 times those two
masses multiplied

00:16:35.950 --> 00:16:40.360
over the sum squared.

00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.240
The full expression-- I'm
going to use a different color

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.010
because I'm running
out of space here.

00:16:45.010 --> 00:16:51.700
The full expression for t is
actually gamma ei over 2 times

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:57.110
1 minus cosine theta.

00:16:57.110 --> 00:17:03.250
The two intuitive limits from
this is if theta equals pi,

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.940
then this here equals 2,
and t is our t maximum,

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:09.730
just gamma times ei.

00:17:09.730 --> 00:17:15.510
If theta equals 0, that
whole thing equals 0.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.910
And in our case of
forward scattering,

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:22.204
no interaction occurs, and
the energy imparted is 0.

00:17:22.204 --> 00:17:23.579
But the important
part here is we

00:17:23.579 --> 00:17:27.630
have a direct relation
between t and theta

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.750
and the angle, which
we can put in here.

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.643
And we actually have a direct
relation between b and theta,

00:17:33.643 --> 00:17:35.310
which I wrote down
so I wouldn't forget.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:41.260
So we actually have--
our impact parameter

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.500
is classical radius
of the electron times

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:46.795
cosine of angle over 2.

00:17:46.795 --> 00:17:48.670
You don't have to know
where these came from,

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.680
but the point is we have
a relation between B

00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:51.820
and the angle.

00:17:51.820 --> 00:17:54.400
We have a relation
between angle and energy.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.290
So we can just do a
change of variables

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.233
to get our final cross-section.

00:18:02.410 --> 00:18:06.210
And it ends up being, I think,
pi times radius of the electron

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.715
squared over gamma.

00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.220
So in this way, we can go from
known relations between each

00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.120
of the variables and an
actual physical cross-section

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:24.240
that has units of real area
down to an energy-dependent form

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.485
for this cross-section,
which I think is pretty cool.

00:18:27.485 --> 00:18:28.860
And then this is
the one that you

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.440
would see tabulated
in the JANIS tables,

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.590
like the energy-dependent
cross-section for the S

00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.995
reaction or the scattering.

00:18:36.995 --> 00:18:39.120
So this is one of my favorite
parts of this course,

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:42.360
because you can see how
cross-sections really

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:46.290
do follow directly from areas.

00:18:46.290 --> 00:18:49.870
So now for the other
part, now that we've

00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:53.880
got this Bremsstrahlung
stopping power

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.460
and we've got our
ionization stopping power,

00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.970
it's useful to find out which
one is more important when.

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:02.550
To do that, we just
look at their ratios.

00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:13.180
So if we look at the dt dx
from ionizations over the dx dx

00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:17.980
from radiative energy
transfer or Bremsstrahlung--

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.020
let me make sure I
get this one right.

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:26.540
It's proportional to z times
mass of the electron over m

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:35.760
squared times t over 1,400
rest mass of the electron.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.200
So what this tells
you here is that--

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:38.700
I'm sorry.

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.910
I think I have those
backwards, because radiative

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.545
should get more important
at higher energies.

00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:52.550
So what this tells you is
for higher z materials,

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.790
Bremsstrahlung
becomes more dominant,

00:19:54.790 --> 00:19:56.830
and for higher
energies, Bremsstrahlung

00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:59.270
becomes more dominant.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:04.460
So if we want to generalize our
stopping power curve from just

00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.580
ionization to everything--

00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.200
so I know I had another color.

00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:09.700
No.

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:10.857
I ran out of colors.

00:20:10.857 --> 00:20:11.690
I need a fourth one.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:19.520
There's going to be some
Bremsstrahlung component that

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.380
starts to get more
and more important

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:23.300
with increasing energy.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.203
And so then if you
extend this curve,

00:20:26.203 --> 00:20:28.370
you're going to radiate
more and more and more power

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.110
the higher energy you go--

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:35.790
not from this component or
that component of ionization,

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:39.060
but from radiation
or Bremsstrahlung.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:42.180
So this has some pretty
serious implications

00:20:42.180 --> 00:20:46.335
to answer questions like,
how do you shield beta rays?

00:20:46.335 --> 00:20:48.230
Does anyone have any idea?

00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:50.900
Based on this
formula right here,

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:53.240
what would you use to
shield beta particles

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.780
and not irradiate the person
standing behind the shield?

00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:02.650
Let's ask a question
everyone knows.

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:06.550
What do you use to shield
photons really well?

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:10.090
Lead, tungsten,
something with high z.

00:21:10.090 --> 00:21:11.425
Because as we saw from before--

00:21:11.425 --> 00:21:15.160
I'm going to steal a little
bit of the Rutherford stuff.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:19.870
If you graph the energy
versus the mass attenuation

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:25.120
coefficient, you get a
curve that looks like this,

00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:29.920
but everything increases
with increasing z.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.260
You get more mass attenuation
with increasing z.

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:35.470
And also, denser materials
tend to be higher z.

00:21:35.470 --> 00:21:37.960
Is that what you want to
do for beta particles?

00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:42.250
You say-- so Monica,
you're saying no.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:42.903
How come?

00:21:42.903 --> 00:21:44.528
AUDIENCE: Don't you
just want something

00:21:44.528 --> 00:21:46.858
with a low cross-section?

00:21:46.858 --> 00:21:47.900
MIKE SHORT: That's right.

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.120
Well, you don't
necessarily want something

00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.620
with a low
cross-section, or else it

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:54.415
might not shield at all, but
you are on the right track.

00:21:54.415 --> 00:21:56.040
You can actually look
at the difference

00:21:56.040 --> 00:21:58.973
between these stopping
powers, and cross-sections

00:21:58.973 --> 00:21:59.890
are embedded in there.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:02.200
So I think that answer
is pretty much correct.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.870
But also, you're going to
get more Bremsstrahlung

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:08.150
or more breaking radiation
in higher z materials.

00:22:08.150 --> 00:22:10.990
So if we actually look at what
thresholds does this become

00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:21.490
important in lead, this ratio
is about 1 at around 10 MeV,

00:22:21.490 --> 00:22:23.710
which means that you lose
an equal amount of energy

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:28.930
to Bremsstrahlung as ionization
at 10 MeV for electrons.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:41.370
In water, this ratio
is about 1 at 100 MeV.

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:45.640
So what this says is if you
want to shield electrons or beta

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.400
particles safely,
you actually have

00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.560
to use lower Z
materials because they

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.360
won't make much Bremsstrahlung.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.910
But because, like Monica
said, then the cross-section

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:56.780
is lower, you actually
have to use more.

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:58.300
So you don't have a choice.

00:22:58.300 --> 00:23:01.950
You can't just use
less high z material.

00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:04.410
Because while you will
stop more of the electrons,

00:23:04.410 --> 00:23:07.110
they will create more
x-rays in the process.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:09.630
And those x-rays are
highly penetrating,

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:12.480
as we know from these
mass attenuation curves.

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.880
Once you get to high
energy, this is--

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.440
these are logarithmic
scales, so let

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:22.190
me correct those and
say these are log of e

00:23:22.190 --> 00:23:24.030
and log of mu over p.

00:23:24.030 --> 00:23:26.580
It gets millions of
times less effective

00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:30.630
at shielding high
energy photons.

00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:32.880
So that's one of those really
important things to note

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:34.838
is if you're designing
shielding for something,

00:23:34.838 --> 00:23:38.440
and there are electrons involved
that are even around 1 MeV

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:42.460
or so, you can't just use high
z materials to shield them,

00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:46.490
or you will create more
problems than you solve.

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:48.350
That's a pretty
important implication.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:52.757
It's quite important for what's
called betavoltaic devices.

00:23:52.757 --> 00:23:54.340
It's kind of a
sidetrack, so I'm going

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.380
to stick it on a board
that'll be hidden soon.

00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.205
Has anyone heard of
a betavoltaic device?

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:03.770
Anyone?

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:05.286
What are they?

00:24:05.286 --> 00:24:06.770
AUDIENCE: It's
like a beta source

00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:11.320
that emits electrons onto a
semiconductor [INAUDIBLE]..

00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.110
MIKE SHORT: Yeah,
it's a beta battery.

00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:19.940
All it is is, let's say,
some pieces of silicon,

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:26.060
some circuit that grabs the
power, and a beta emitter.

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.300
And these beta particles
directly hit the silicon,

00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.930
and the movement of those
betas constitutes a charge.

00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:36.680
And it's direct-- it's direct
conversion of radiation

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.240
to electrical energy.

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.180
They're not very high power, but
they last for a very long time.

00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.430
How long?

00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:46.515
Around a few half lives
of that beta decay.

00:24:46.515 --> 00:24:48.140
So for most of these
beta emitters that

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.530
have half lives in the realm
of, like, 10 to 1,000 years,

00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:55.490
you can make a microwatt battery
that could last for millennia.

00:24:55.490 --> 00:24:57.320
This could be pretty useful.

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.810
Let's say if you wanted to
have some secret sensors

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:02.570
in a naughty country
like North Korea,

00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:05.060
you could drop these tiny
little beta particles that would

00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:09.330
just-- betavoltaics that would
just trickle charge a battery,

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:10.310
make a measurement of--

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.430
I don't know-- radiation level,
or weight of the dictator,

00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:16.010
or whatever you happen
to want to measure,

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.160
and send that off once
a month or once a year

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.620
with no need for
external monitoring.

00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:25.280
Or let's say you're designing
a mission to land on a comet,

00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.420
like the Rosetta Philae Lander,
and your radiothermal isotope

00:25:29.420 --> 00:25:32.180
generator is going to burn out
in, let's say, 10 or 20 years.

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.890
You might not need
that much power just

00:25:33.890 --> 00:25:35.600
to measure temperature,
or light levels,

00:25:35.600 --> 00:25:37.370
or something else, or
a gas that you might

00:25:37.370 --> 00:25:39.280
want to know what's there.

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.765
But you have to choose
your beta isotope wisely.

00:25:42.765 --> 00:25:44.890
If you want to make these
things in a little chip--

00:25:44.890 --> 00:25:47.890
and they actually have been
commercialized in a chip

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:50.470
that's about that
actual size using

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.160
about two curies of tritium.

00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:55.425
Anyone have any idea why
one would choose tritium?

00:26:01.178 --> 00:26:02.720
AUDIENCE: It's got
a short half-life.

00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.860
MIKE SHORT: Yeah, it's
got a short half-life,

00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:06.080
so you can get a lot
of power out of it.

00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:08.210
That's one of the
two correct reasons.

00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.210
And what is the other one?

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:14.960
Lets see who's memorized
there KAERI table of nuclides.

00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:17.000
What do you think
its beta decay energy

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.549
would have to be for this not
to blast anyone in the vicinity?

00:26:24.461 --> 00:26:25.165
AUDIENCE: Low.

00:26:25.165 --> 00:26:26.040
MIKE SHORT: Very low.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.210
Why do you say that?

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:33.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] they
don't penetrate all the way

00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:34.540
through the [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.540
MIKE SHORT: That's true.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.120
Their range is much smaller.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.320
But the range of all betas
is pretty low in materials.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:43.030
But the answer lies right here--

00:26:43.030 --> 00:26:44.800
less Bremsstrahlung.

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.250
Lower energy betas give
most of their energy

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:53.020
off in ionization rather than
by radiating Bremsstrahlung.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:56.060
So you can have a device
with two curies of tritium,

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:59.590
which if that's released to the
outside world, that's bad news.

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.990
That's something that
you might have to report.

00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:05.180
But as long as it stays
contained in this device,

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:08.710
it does not have enough
energy to produce many x-rays

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.030
from Bremsstrahlung.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.430
And therefore, it does not
require an enormous amount

00:27:12.430 --> 00:27:13.420
of shielding.

00:27:13.420 --> 00:27:15.120
So you can't just
pick a 1 MeV beta

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.870
emitter which you might
get a lot of power

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.420
out of, because it's also
going to be a big, crazy X-ray

00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:22.480
source that you wouldn't want
in a cell phone or a sensor

00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.000
or some other device you
might put in your pocket,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:28.402
or even 20 feet from you.

00:27:28.402 --> 00:27:30.220
Cool.

00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:33.385
So that's the idea
behind Bremsstrahlung.

00:27:33.385 --> 00:27:35.510
There's a little bit more
I want to tell you about,

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:39.020
and I'll save that for
the sidetrack board.

00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.420
We use Bremsstrahlung in a
lot of really interesting

00:27:41.420 --> 00:27:47.000
applications, including
cyclotron, one of which

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.990
we just took delivery of here
at MIT, or a synchrotron.

00:27:54.970 --> 00:27:57.470
And I'll just briefly
explain how these work.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:01.070
In a cyclotron, you've
got two D-shaped magnets.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:04.580
They actually call
them dees because we're

00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:07.520
so creative in
naming these things.

00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:11.890
You inject some source
of charged particles,

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:19.130
and there is some electric
field lines across these two dee

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:20.180
magnets.

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.510
And what this says is that
in between the magnets,

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.280
the particle accelerates.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:29.180
And inside each magnet,
the path curves.

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.190
And it accelerates some more.

00:28:31.190 --> 00:28:34.420
And it's moving even faster,
so it takes longer to curve.

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.520
Than it moves even faster,
and it takes longer to curve,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:44.920
and so on and so on, until it
finally shoots out the side.

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:47.830
And so this is one way that you
can have an extremely compact--

00:28:47.830 --> 00:28:50.320
and I'm talking like
garbage-can-sized--

00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.490
accelerator that brings
things up to about 13 MeV.

00:28:54.490 --> 00:28:57.370
That's the one that we've got
in the basement of Northwest 13.

00:28:57.370 --> 00:28:59.710
The problem is every
time these particles

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:07.260
bend, they send
off photons, what's

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:09.240
known as cyclotron radiation.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.690
And the higher energy
that is, the more intense

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:14.850
that cyclotron radiation gets.

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:18.480
So you've got this
garbage-can-sized device with

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.040
a little hole right here, and
it's just blasting out photons

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:25.140
in all directions
in this one plane--

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.120
let's just call it
the plane of death--

00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.770
which you don't
want to be in, which

00:29:28.770 --> 00:29:31.860
is why this the thing is behind
4 feet of concrete shielding,

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:34.110
and in the middle
of a room, to help--

00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:37.080
that 1 over r squared
keeps your dose down.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:42.330
But we actually use this plane
of death in a synchrotron.

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.680
What it is is it's a
circular accelerator.

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.280
It's not quite circular,
so let me correct

00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.870
my drawing a little bit.

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.780
There are straight segments,
and there are slightly

00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:52.650
curved segments.

00:29:56.670 --> 00:29:59.490
But it pretty much
looks like a circle

00:29:59.490 --> 00:30:01.200
if you look at it
from high up enough.

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.200
In each of these
curved segments,

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.520
there is a bending magnet.

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:10.300
That's my best
drawing for a magnet.

00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:15.960
And what this does
is it continuously

00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:21.480
changes the path of these
charged particles going through

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:23.010
usually electrons.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:25.410
And you end up
with intense beams.

00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:26.910
Let me use a different color.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:30.690
You end up with intense
beams perpendicular

00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.650
to the original path before
it went in that bending magnet

00:30:34.650 --> 00:30:38.700
of synchrotron radiation.

00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:42.420
So it's kind of like
a gigaelectron volt

00:30:42.420 --> 00:30:44.790
spinning ninja star of
death, except at the end

00:30:44.790 --> 00:30:47.700
of every one of these
stations, you have

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.780
what's called a beam line.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:55.040
Because there's 60 or
80-odd of these beam lines

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:56.930
coming off with,
let's say, 80 kv

00:30:56.930 --> 00:30:59.720
and below Bremsstrahlung
x-rays, you

00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:02.760
can use those for a whole lot of
different analysis techniques.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.820
You can simply irradiate things.

00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:09.140
You can send those x-rays
through a monochromator

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.260
to select only one wavelength,
and then use that wavelength

00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:15.310
to probe the structure of
matter down to the atomic level.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:17.810
There's actually one of these
just down in Long Island.

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.490
About a 2-and-1/2-hour
drive from here,

00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:21.530
there's Brookhaven National Lab.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.780
And they just opened up the
National Synchrotron Light

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:27.260
Source, or NSLS version
2, where they can actually

00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:32.150
measure distances with
single nanometer precision.

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:35.840
So inside this beam
line is a bigger room

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.850
which is encased in
another room which

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:39.710
is encased in another room.

00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:42.230
And the whole point of that is
for vibration and temperature

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:43.280
isolation.

00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:45.540
So they maintain
this entire room

00:31:45.540 --> 00:31:49.400
to within a speck
of 0.1 Celsius.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:52.375
And it's the least vibrating
place, probably, in the US.

00:31:52.375 --> 00:31:53.750
I don't know about
on the planet.

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:56.750
But it's got basically
no vibration.

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:58.550
So the atoms are
effectively standing

00:31:58.550 --> 00:32:01.860
still except for their normal
vibrations in the material.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.017
But there's no source
of external vibration.

00:32:04.017 --> 00:32:05.600
And the cooling has
to come in through

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.500
these convoluted channels so
as not to blow on the sample,

00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.450
so as not to make any convection
currents or temperature

00:32:12.450 --> 00:32:12.950
changes.

00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:15.075
And they can actually probe
the structure of matter

00:32:15.075 --> 00:32:19.370
with single-nanometer precision
using these synchrotron x-rays

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:23.240
all produced by Bremsstrahlung.

00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:24.360
So it's not all bad.

00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.535
You can use
Bremsstrahlung for good.

00:32:27.535 --> 00:32:28.660
Then there's a little bit--

00:32:28.660 --> 00:32:30.790
I have to hijack
a little more area

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:32.805
from Rutherford scattering.

00:32:32.805 --> 00:32:34.180
You might think
about, well, what

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.300
is the actual spectrum
of this Bremsstrahlung.

00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.610
Well, you can look to see
what's the probability

00:32:39.610 --> 00:32:45.580
that an atom enters into any
of these concentric, hollow

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:46.870
circles.

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:49.510
It looks to be less and
less likely that you're

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:51.520
going to enter through
one of the center rings

00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:53.020
and more and more
likely that you're

00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.190
going to enter through
one of the outer rings.

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:58.600
If you start farther away,
there's less of a pull

00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.180
to change the path of
that ion or electron,

00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:05.000
and the Bremsstrahlung is
going to be lower in energy.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.580
This is actually
described by what's

00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:15.618
called Cramer's law, which
says that the intensity

00:33:15.618 --> 00:33:17.660
of the Bremsstrahlung as
a function of wavelength

00:33:17.660 --> 00:33:21.890
scales with some constant k,
and that constant scales with--

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:23.900
surprise, surprise--
the atomic number

00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:29.240
of the material
times some lambda

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:36.273
over lambda minimum minus 1
times 1 over lambda squared.

00:33:36.273 --> 00:33:37.690
And what this says
is that there's

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:43.110
some minimum lambda
or some maximum energy

00:33:43.110 --> 00:33:45.330
that you can impart to
this Bremsstrahlung, which

00:33:45.330 --> 00:33:48.610
again, you can only take some
energy before you take it all.

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.440
And there's going to be some
sort of a fixed minimum lambda

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.840
if we draw this intensity.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:57.120
And I graphed this on Desmos
just before coming here,

00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.390
so I know it looks something
like this where that

00:34:00.390 --> 00:34:05.190
right there is lambda minimum.

00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:06.910
It's taking more area.

00:34:06.910 --> 00:34:14.190
If you then change variables
from lambda to the angular

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.110
frequency where,
if you remember,

00:34:16.110 --> 00:34:22.830
the energy of the photon is just
h bar times that frequency-- so

00:34:22.830 --> 00:34:27.420
it's kind of like converting
into energy with just a tiny,

00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.679
little constant in front.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:31.170
And I mean really, really
tiny little constant.

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:35.370
You end up with
an energy relation

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:40.719
that looks like some
maximum angular frequency

00:34:40.719 --> 00:34:44.380
or some maximum energy.

00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.909
And this is kind of a simple,
linear-looking relation, this 1

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:52.000
over energy relation minus 1.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.760
So if we graph energy
versus the intensity

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:56.679
of the Bremsstrahlung,
you end up

00:34:56.679 --> 00:35:02.170
with a curve something
like this where

00:35:02.170 --> 00:35:07.960
your max energy is the same as
your incoming particle energy.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:11.470
Now, who here has done any
sort of X-ray or SCM analysis

00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:12.650
before?

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:13.150
You have.

00:35:13.150 --> 00:35:15.520
So can you tell me, is this
the Bremsstrahlung spectrum

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:17.605
that you tend to see?

00:35:17.605 --> 00:35:19.522
AUDIENCE: Well, I've
done [INAUDIBLE] analysis

00:35:19.522 --> 00:35:20.250
with imaging.

00:35:20.250 --> 00:35:22.347
MIKE SHORT: OK.

00:35:22.347 --> 00:35:24.430
Have you ever gotten a
regular, old X-ray spectrum

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:26.770
to see what elements are there?

00:35:26.770 --> 00:35:28.623
Can you draw what
one looks like?

00:35:28.623 --> 00:35:29.290
AUDIENCE: Maybe.

00:35:29.290 --> 00:35:31.965
MIKE SHORT: You want to try?

00:35:31.965 --> 00:35:32.840
They're all the same.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.090
So if you remember any
particular one, you're correct.

00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:41.110
Yep.

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.015
There's some peaks.

00:35:42.015 --> 00:35:44.140
And then what does this
background stuff look like?

00:35:48.250 --> 00:35:49.400
Yeah.

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:52.070
There's some noise and junk
on the back of it, right?

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:53.950
So this is actually correct.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:55.100
Thank you.

00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:58.220
And what you actually
see here is a bunch

00:35:58.220 --> 00:35:59.690
of characteristic peaks.

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:03.350
These will maybe be like
the L lines and the K lines

00:36:03.350 --> 00:36:06.560
for one element or another,
these characteristic X-ray

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.090
peaks, on top of
the Bremsstrahlung,

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:11.840
the breaking radiation
which constitutes

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.040
the background here.

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:14.300
And what you actually see--

00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.130
I'm just going to draw
the background curve

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:18.440
under Julia's curve here--

00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:20.960
looks something like this.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.300
What happened to
the real spectrum?

00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:27.540
Why don't we observe
what actually exists?

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.790
There are a couple of reasons.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.376
Does anybody have an idea?

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.220
So let's take this
to the extreme.

00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:40.590
Why don't you think you
would observe physically--

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:42.840
and this is when we actually
get into the real world--

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:45.600
any x-rays with energy
in, let's say, the eV

00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:52.150
range if you were to try and
observe any x-rays at all?

00:36:58.470 --> 00:37:01.020
This is where we
actually get into what

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:03.510
do these detectors look like.

00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:07.570
So there will be some active
piece of your material

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:10.080
if this is your detector.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.210
This is most definitely not
Rutherford scattering anymore.

00:37:15.210 --> 00:37:17.790
And there's got
to be some window.

00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:20.560
We can make it as thin
as we possibly can.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.910
And they make it out of the most
X-ray-transparent structural

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.720
material that they can,
which tends to be beryllium.

00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.460
So beryllium has got
an atomic number 4.

00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:33.470
It's the first and
lightest element

00:37:33.470 --> 00:37:36.230
that you can make
structural anythings out of.

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.830
So if you want to protect
your detector from, let's say,

00:37:39.830 --> 00:37:41.945
air or something-- if
this were full of air,

00:37:41.945 --> 00:37:43.820
it would absorb the
x-rays, so you want there

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:45.680
to be pretty much nothing.

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.030
You can put a very thin,
seven-micron beryllium

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:51.440
window in front.

00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.520
But the problem is
we've already got

00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:55.100
one of these mass
attenuation curves.

00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.980
And when you get down
to these energy levels,

00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.990
you attenuate everything.

00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:03.175
So the lower energy
your Bremsstrahlung is,

00:38:03.175 --> 00:38:04.800
the less likely you're
going to see it.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:14.560
So even though this is the
actual Bremsstrahlung spectrum,

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560
this is what we observe.

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.070
And I haven't finished
grading the tests yet.

00:38:22.070 --> 00:38:25.095
But I like I promised, for
the two folks who do the best,

00:38:25.095 --> 00:38:26.720
I'm going to ask you
to bring something

00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:28.790
in for elemental analysis.

00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:31.640
This is precisely what
we're going to see.

00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:35.000
You're going to see this
Bremsstrahlung which is not

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.640
the actual spectrum
coming out, but this

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:39.530
has to do with the
absorption of x-rays

00:38:39.530 --> 00:38:43.910
in the detector window, as
well as some self-shielding.

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:46.430
If we're using a scanning
electron microscope, which

00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:49.760
is nothing more than
an electron gun,

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:53.060
and you're firing electrons to
some distance in the material

00:38:53.060 --> 00:38:59.540
where they'll then interact
and send off x-rays,

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:03.830
you've also got this part of
the material to contend with,

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:05.300
some self-shielding.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:10.310
So not only do the x-rays
all have to get through

00:39:10.310 --> 00:39:12.680
the detector window
to be counted--

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.560
so the high-energy
ones, which we'll

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.640
have with small
wavelength, get through,

00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:20.090
but the low-energy or
long-wavelength ones

00:39:20.090 --> 00:39:21.530
might get stopped.

00:39:21.530 --> 00:39:24.020
You also have to get out
of the material itself.

00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.910
The electrons don't
just produce x-rays

00:39:25.910 --> 00:39:28.130
in the outer atoms
of the material.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.050
They go down a micron or two.

00:39:30.050 --> 00:39:33.680
And then the x-rays that are
produced in those interactions

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:36.827
have to get back out again.

00:39:36.827 --> 00:39:37.660
So it's interesting.

00:39:37.660 --> 00:39:40.520
It's kind of like the inverse
photoelectric effect, right?

00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:43.140
In the photoelectric
effect, photon comes in,

00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.850
electrons come out.

00:39:44.850 --> 00:39:47.910
In a scanning electron
microscope, electrons come in.

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.380
Photons come out.

00:39:49.380 --> 00:39:53.010
Many of them are these
characteristic x-rays.

00:39:53.010 --> 00:39:54.810
Because now if we
start to review

00:39:54.810 --> 00:39:58.230
what sort of interactions are
possible when we fire electrons

00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.465
into material, we've just
gone over Bremsstrahlung.

00:40:01.465 --> 00:40:03.840
And we know that with higher
and higher energy electrons,

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.910
you're going to get more
and more Bremsstrahlung.

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:09.300
But you're not going to see
the actual x-rays produced

00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:12.810
at low energies no matter
what, because this isn't just

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:13.710
a system on paper.

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:15.210
It's real life.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:19.140
And you're going to get
characteristic x-rays that

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:23.220
come from energy transitions.

00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:25.380
So if you fire in
an electron, and you

00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:29.910
happen to undergo one of
these ionization collisions,

00:40:29.910 --> 00:40:33.375
you might just knock
an electron out.

00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:38.250
So let's say an electron comes
in, knocks an electron out.

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:43.610
Then another electron
fills that shell,

00:40:43.610 --> 00:40:47.840
giving off-- in this case, it
would be a k alpha or a shell 2

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.150
to a shell 1 X-ray
the way I've drawn

00:40:50.150 --> 00:40:52.490
it, which is why Julia
has got everything

00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:54.050
right on the spectrum here.

00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:56.120
There's the Bremsstrahlung,
and then there's

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.460
these characteristic peaks.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:01.740
The background is due to
radiative stopping power,

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.500
and these characteristic
peaks give away

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:06.980
some of the ionization
stopping power.

00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:10.310
And so all in one spectrum, you
can see just about everything

00:41:10.310 --> 00:41:12.930
going on in this material.

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:17.150
The last thing that you can't
see that I would be remiss

00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:21.860
if I didn't talk about it as
a radiation material scientist

00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.590
is radiation material
science, which

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:29.090
really is concerned with
mostly Rutherford scattering,

00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:31.547
Rutherford or hard
sphere scattering.

00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:41.420
This is the last of
the major interactions

00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:45.230
between charged particles
and matter that concern us.

00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:47.630
It's not really in your
reading except for, I think,

00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:51.282
being mentioned once,
because they didn't

00:41:51.282 --> 00:41:52.490
seem to think it's important.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.620
But I happen to think
it's extremely important,

00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.960
because this is the basis
behind radiation damage.

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:05.200
In all of these
collisions right here,

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:08.320
you have some sort of
displacement of electrons.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.872
And those electrons
can get ionized,

00:42:09.872 --> 00:42:11.830
and other ones will fill
them back in the holes

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:13.250
and whatever they'll do.

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:17.200
But at no point were
nuclei displaced.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.770
You can transfer a lot of
energy without moving any atoms

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:21.760
around.

00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.580
But when your energy
starts to get lower,

00:42:24.580 --> 00:42:29.097
you end up with a new
kind of stopping power--

00:42:29.097 --> 00:42:30.055
let's call it nuclear--

00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:39.350
which scales with, as always,
a number density times pi.

00:42:39.350 --> 00:42:40.640
Let's see.

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:42.740
Little z, big z, e the 4th--

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:46.310
everything looks pretty
similar so far, except for now

00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:49.220
we've got the energy of
the incoming material,

00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:54.208
and now we have a mass ratio.

00:42:54.208 --> 00:42:55.750
Because in this
case, you're actually

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:57.370
undergoing some sort
of a hard sphere

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:02.020
collision between one
atom and the other times

00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:03.020
the natural log.

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.310
This is going to look
awfully familiar.

00:43:06.310 --> 00:43:10.980
It ends up being some
energy term over--

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:14.200
actually, let's
just go with-- yeah,

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:18.280
gamma ei over some new energy.

00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:22.550
This thing right here is called
the displacement threshold

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:23.050
energy.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:35.730
And it ranges from about 25 to
90 eV, but it's usually 40 eV.

00:43:35.730 --> 00:43:37.360
And what that is--
it's the max--

00:43:37.360 --> 00:43:39.130
the minimum amount
of energy that

00:43:39.130 --> 00:43:43.300
has to be imparted to a nucleus
smack head on in order for it

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.090
to move from its
original atomic position.

00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:48.990
And that's what's known as a
hard sphere type collision.

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:52.120
Or in this case,
it's just like all

00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:56.230
the other
q-equation-looking scenarios

00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:59.730
that we looked at before.

00:43:59.730 --> 00:44:02.770
So let's say the little
nucleus goes off,

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.395
and the big nucleus goes off.

00:44:05.395 --> 00:44:07.270
This should look familiar
by now because I've

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:09.610
harped on it probably too much.

00:44:09.610 --> 00:44:13.960
Now what I want you to
consider is this big nucleus

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.950
had a position.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:18.570
It liked where it was, and
now it's been knocked away.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.610
What's left over is
an atomic vacancy,

00:44:21.610 --> 00:44:25.810
which is the most basic building
block of radiation damage.

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:28.360
So sometimes it's neat
to look at the ratio of--

00:44:31.010 --> 00:44:31.570
let's see.

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:33.280
Make sure I get
this ratio right.

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:34.510
Ionization on top.

00:44:41.310 --> 00:44:44.970
To look and see when is
ionization versus radiation

00:44:44.970 --> 00:44:46.910
damage actually important.

00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:53.010
And the ratio scales with 2
times the mass of the nucleus

00:44:53.010 --> 00:44:59.145
over MeZ times their respective
natural log threshold things.

00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.450
And that's the ionization
potential and log gamma

00:45:06.450 --> 00:45:10.110
ei over ed.

00:45:10.110 --> 00:45:15.000
So what this says is
that for higher energies,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.270
ionization is more important,
and for lower energies,

00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:20.610
nuclear stopping power
or radiation damage

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:22.560
is more important.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:28.290
If we graph these two, let's
say, on a log e graph--

00:45:28.290 --> 00:45:30.450
and let's say we have
our nuclear stopping

00:45:30.450 --> 00:45:36.750
power in blue and our ionization
stopping power in green--

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:40.760
we end up with curves that
look something like this.

00:45:44.483 --> 00:45:45.275
That's our nuclear.

00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:51.470
That's our electronic or ionic.

00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:55.490
So what this actually says is
if you fire high-energy neutrons

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:58.760
or high-energy protons
into a material,

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:02.450
it's ionization that does most
of the damage at high energies

00:46:02.450 --> 00:46:08.720
until you slow down to
around like 10 to 100 keV

00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:15.470
level, curiously very similar
to this 500 times i bar,

00:46:15.470 --> 00:46:19.430
the mean ionization potential,
at which point Rutherford

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:21.590
scattering or hard
sphere scattering becomes

00:46:21.590 --> 00:46:23.518
the dominant mechanism.

00:46:23.518 --> 00:46:26.060
And so what this says is if we
want to draw a picture of what

00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:28.120
radiation damage looks like--

00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:32.450
let's say we had a proton that
we're firing into a material,

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:36.450
and it hits some
atom that we're going

00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:40.550
to call the PKA or
Primary Knock-on Atom.

00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:43.270
That PKA then becomes--

00:46:43.270 --> 00:46:45.830
let's say it was nickel.

00:46:45.830 --> 00:46:48.920
It's like a nickel plus
26 ion because you've

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.350
knocked the nucleus out of its
electron cloud, effectively,

00:46:52.350 --> 00:46:54.590
and it's now flying out
through the material.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:59.720
That proton might go off to
do more damage somewhere else,

00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:02.410
but it's not
actually the protons

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:04.310
or the incoming particles
that do the bulk

00:47:04.310 --> 00:47:05.840
of the final radiation damage.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:12.830
The radiation damage is
mostly self-ion radiation.

00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.200
Even though it all starts
with the incoming particle,

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:17.840
nothing would happen if the
incoming particle didn't

00:47:17.840 --> 00:47:18.860
show up.

00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.930
Most of the final
results of the damage

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:24.590
are from these heavy
ion collisions.

00:47:24.590 --> 00:47:27.680
And so we actually talked
a little bit about--

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.590
I think we talked about
when this ionization starts

00:47:30.590 --> 00:47:33.890
to pick up for electrons
versus heavy ions.

00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:37.273
If you think about when
electrons start to radiate away

00:47:37.273 --> 00:47:39.440
most of their energy, taking
it away from radiation,

00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:42.980
it's like 10 to 100 MeV.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.860
What would be the case for a
heavy ion, like even a proton?

00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:53.060
Well, what's the only
thing that changes

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:58.586
when you change from an
electron to a proton here?

00:47:58.586 --> 00:48:00.297
AUDIENCE: The charge.

00:48:00.297 --> 00:48:02.630
MIKE SHORT: Well, yeah, the
charge is the opposite sign,

00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:04.200
but of equal strength.

00:48:04.200 --> 00:48:07.121
But what else in this formula?

00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:08.488
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:08.488 --> 00:48:09.530
MIKE SHORT: That's right.

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:15.900
So for heavy ions, for
even things like protons,

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:21.600
you need to go at
approximately 1,837

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:26.160
squared more energy
than the electron.

00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:29.010
So we're talking in
the gigaelectron volt

00:48:29.010 --> 00:48:33.670
to teraelectron
volt range for ions.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:35.910
So this is why
Bremsstrahlung is not

00:48:35.910 --> 00:48:39.600
important for any sort
of ion interactions

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.910
unless you are a
high-energy physicist

00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:44.040
and you're working in
the GeV or gigaelectron

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.540
volt in the upper range.

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.520
So we like to say in the
radiation damage field

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.140
if you want to know
the total stopping

00:48:50.140 --> 00:48:55.230
power from all
interactions, you have

00:48:55.230 --> 00:49:00.920
to take into account
the ionizations.

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:07.480
I'll just make that a
minus sign for the symbols.

00:49:07.480 --> 00:49:14.760
The nuclear and the radiative.

00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:16.890
For most radiation
damage processes

00:49:16.890 --> 00:49:21.660
except for high-energy electron
radiation, we neglect that.

00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:25.680
The reason is that the
radiative to ionization stopping

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.140
power is pretty close to zero.

00:49:28.140 --> 00:49:33.610
It's like-- even at 10 NeV,
it's like 1 over 2,000 squared--

00:49:33.610 --> 00:49:35.845
or 1 over, I guess, 4,000,000.

00:49:35.845 --> 00:49:37.840
It doesn't matter at all.

00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:40.690
With heavier ions, it
becomes even less of an issue

00:49:40.690 --> 00:49:43.600
because you can deflect
a heavier ion less

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.350
with the same Coulomb.

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:48.510
And so what ends
up only mattering

00:49:48.510 --> 00:49:53.280
is the ionization stopping power
and the nuclear stopping power.

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:57.540
It's this nuclear stopping
power that leads to collisions.

00:49:57.540 --> 00:50:00.190
And it's like two of five of.

00:50:00.190 --> 00:50:02.760
So I want to stop here
and answer any questions.

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:05.760
And I'll hijack a bit of the
neutron discussion on Thursday

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.290
with some review
of this and filling

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.090
in the last gaps of
radiation damage.

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:15.170
So anyone have any
questions from today?

00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.670
Yeah?

00:50:15.670 --> 00:50:17.253
AUDIENCE: Can you
repeat what you just

00:50:17.253 --> 00:50:19.180
said about why the
radiation term goes away?

00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:19.888
MIKE SHORT: Yeah.

00:50:19.888 --> 00:50:23.367
The radiation term goes
away because of that.

00:50:23.367 --> 00:50:25.700
AUDIENCE: And that's under
the assumption you're working

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:28.340
with a proton or a heavier--

00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.330
MIKE SHORT: Yeah.

00:50:29.330 --> 00:50:31.520
If you're working
with an electron,

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.840
then it actually does matter.

00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:35.570
If you're firing 10 MeV
electrons into something,

00:50:35.570 --> 00:50:38.270
you must account for the
radiative stopping power,

00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:39.500
because there's a lot of it.

00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:42.880
At 10 MeV, there's as much
radiative as ionizing,

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:45.520
and there's basically
no nuclear yet.

00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.870
But for anything heavier--

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:50.500
even muons, which are
approximately 237 times

00:50:50.500 --> 00:50:55.030
heavier, or protons, which
are approximately 1,837 times

00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:57.490
heavier, it totally doesn't
matter because it scales

00:50:57.490 --> 00:51:00.205
with the mass ratio squared.

00:51:00.205 --> 00:51:02.320
It might be 267 for muons.

00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:04.960
I forget that middle number.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.387
But still, 267 squared
is a pretty big number.

00:51:08.387 --> 00:51:09.720
Was there another question here?

00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.160
I thought I had seen a hand.

00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.740
So remember, you
guys had said you

00:51:14.740 --> 00:51:17.290
want to see some radiation
material science or radiation

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:18.040
damage.

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.570
This is where it comes from.

00:51:19.570 --> 00:51:22.120
This is why I love
teaching graduate radiation

00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:24.240
damage and 22.01
at the same time--

00:51:24.240 --> 00:51:25.930
because they're the same thing.

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:27.430
Except you guys get
the derivations,

00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:30.040
and in the grad class, I
say I assume they know it.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:32.040
And then in the homework,
I find out they don't.

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.640
But it doesn't matter
because they're supposed to.

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:37.310
At least you guys will,
so you've got the power.

00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:39.190
And knowledge brings
fear, as I like to say.

00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.063
OK.

00:51:43.063 --> 00:51:44.480
I'll see you guys
on Thursday when

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.190
we'll wrap up a little
bit more radiation

00:51:46.190 --> 00:51:47.590
damage, because I can't resist.

00:51:47.590 --> 00:51:50.090
And then we'll start moving
into neutron interactions, which

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:52.160
is kind of taking a
step down from here,

00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:55.220
because there aren't really
any electronic interactions.

00:51:55.220 --> 00:51:57.800
But because we can deal
with enormous populations

00:51:57.800 --> 00:52:01.846
of neutrons, things
are going to get messy.

00:52:01.846 --> 00:52:03.530
Have you seen the
equation shirts

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:07.160
that we have here, the neutron
transport equation shirts?

00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:07.660
Yeah.

00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:11.100
We're going to derive
that on Thursday.

00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:02.650
PROFESSOR: Today we'll
talk about observables

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:04.184
and Hermitian operators.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:32.759
So we've said that an operator,
Q, is Hermitian in the language

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.440
that we've been working
so far, if you find

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.960
that the integral,
dx psi 1 Q psi 2,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:55.920
is actually equal to
the integral dx of Q,

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.460
acting this time of
Psi 1 all star psi 2.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.700
So as you've learned already,
this requires some properties

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.800
about the way
functions far away,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.350
at infinity, some integration
by parts, some things to manage,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.820
but this is the
general statement

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.260
for a large class of
functions, this should be true.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:27.060
Now we want to, sometimes,
use a briefer notation

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.710
for all of this.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.530
And I will sometimes
use it, sometimes not,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.820
and you do whatever you feel.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.580
If you like to use
this notation, us it.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.190
So here's the definition.

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.740
If you put up Psi 1,
Psi 2 and a parentheses,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.550
this denotes a number,
and in fact denotes

00:01:50.550 --> 00:02:00.342
the integral of psi 1
star of x, psi 2 of x dx.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880
So whatever you put
in the first input

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.889
ends up complex motivated.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:11.630
When you put in
the second input,

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.520
it's like that,
it's all integrated.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.580
This has a couple of
obvious properties.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:26.130
If you put a number times
psi 1 times psi 2 like this,

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.305
the number will appear,
together with psi 1,

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:33.180
and will complex conjugated.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.510
So it can go out as
a star psi 1 psi 2.

00:02:43.294 --> 00:02:50.970
And if you put the number
on the second input,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.460
it comes out as is.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.470
Because the second
input is not complex

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.060
conjugated in the definition.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.380
With this definition,
a Hermitian operator,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.190
Q is Hermitian, has
a nice look to it.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.610
It becomes kind of
natural and simple.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:27.340
It's the statement that if
you have psi 1, Q psi 2,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.690
you can put the Q
in the first input.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.440
Q psi 1 psi 2.

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:45.400
This second term in
the right hand side

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.400
is exactly this integral here.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.570
And the first tern
in the left hand side

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.650
is the left hand side
of that condition.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.280
So it's just maybe a
briefer way to write it.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.230
So when you get tired of writing
integral dx of the first,

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.290
the second, you can use this.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:12.280
Now with distance last
time, the expectation

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.300
values of operators.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:29.800
So what's the expectation value
of Q in some state psi of x?

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:39.140
And that is denoted as
these braces here and of psi

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:43.530
is equal to the integral of psi.

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.980
The expectation value depends
on the state you live in

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.930
and it's psi Q psi.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.590
Or if you wish, dx in
written notation psi

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:05.180
Q. I should put the
hats everywhere.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:11.930
This is the expectation
value of Q. I'm sorry,

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.279
I missed here a star.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:22.820
So so far, so good.

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.380
We've reviewed what a
Hermitian operator is,

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.960
what an expectation value is,
so let's begin with some claims.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.839
Claim number one.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:42.980
The expectation value
of Q, with Q Hermitian.

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.970
So everywhere here,
Q will be Hermitian.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.106
The expectation
value of Q is real.

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:56.900
A real number, it belongs
to the real numbers.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.530
So that's an important thing.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.065
You want to figure out the
expectation value of Q,

00:06:03.065 --> 00:06:06.710
you have a psi star,
you have a psi.

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:09.875
Well, it'd better be real
if we're going to think,

00:06:09.875 --> 00:06:13.510
and that's the goal
of this discussion,

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:16.400
that Hermitian operators
are the things you

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.140
can measure in
quantum mechanics,

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.570
so this better be real.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:25.050
So let's see what this is.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.220
Well, Q psi, that's
the expectation value.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.180
If I complex conjugate
it, I must complex

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.920
conjugate this whole thing.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.120
Now if you want to complex
conjugate an integral,

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.922
you can complex
conjugate the integrand.

00:06:56.254 --> 00:06:57.600
Here it is.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:02.190
I took this right hand
side here, the integrand.

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:05.290
I copied it, and now I
complex conjugated it.

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.530
That's what you mean by complex
conjugating an integral.

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.920
But this is equal, integral dx.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:16.680
Now I have a product
of two functions here.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:21.330
Psi star and Q that
has acted on psi.

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:22.950
So that's how I think.

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:27.960
I never think of
conjugating Q. Q is

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:31.695
a set of operations
that have acted on psi

00:07:31.695 --> 00:07:33.590
and I'm just going
to conjugate it.

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.270
And the nice thing
is that you never

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:40.440
have to think of what is Q
star, there's no meaning for it.

00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:42.080
So what happens here?

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:45.030
Priority of two functions,
the complex conjugate

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.840
of the first--

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.080
now if you [INAUDIBLE]
normally something twice,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.100
you get the function back.

00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:57.000
And here you've got Q psi star.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.820
But that, these are functions.

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.420
You can move around.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:11.140
So this Q hat psi star Q psi.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.550
And so far so good.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:17.970
You know, I've done
everything I could have done.

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:20.180
They told to come to
complex conjugate this,

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:26.100
so I complex conjugated it
and I'm still not there.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.620
But I haven't used that
this operator is Hermitian.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.610
So because the
operator is Hermitian,

00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:40.570
now you can move the Q from this
first input to the second one.

00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:46.850
So it's equal to integral
dx psi star Q psi.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.840
And oh, that was the
expectation value of Q on psi,

00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:57.350
so the star of this number is
equal to the number itself,

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:03.611
and that proves the
claim, Q is real.

00:09:12.450 --> 00:09:16.570
So this is our first claim.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:22.770
The second claim that is
equally important, claim two.

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:33.180
The eigenvalues of the
operator Q are real.

00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:49.636
So what are the
eigenvalues of Q?

00:09:49.636 --> 00:09:52.640
Well you've learned, with
the momentum operator,

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.405
eigenvalues or
eigenfunctions of an operator

00:09:56.405 --> 00:09:59.480
are those special functions
that the operator acts on them

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:02.660
and gives you a number
called the eigenvalue times

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:03.440
that function.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:08.900
So Q, say, times,
psi 1, if psi 1

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:12.905
is a particularly
nice choice, then it

00:10:12.905 --> 00:10:14.580
will be equal to some number.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:19.650
Let me quote Q1 times psi1.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:26.540
And there, I will say
that Q1 is the eigenvalue.

00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:34.210
That's the definition.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:40.690
And psi1 is the eigenvector,
or the eigenfunction.

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:54.920
And the claim is that that
number is going to real.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.100
So why would that be the case?

00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:02.640
Well, we can prove
it in many ways,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:09.300
but we can prove it kind of
easily with claim number one.

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:11.760
And actually gain
a little insight,

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.740
cold calculate the
expectation value of Q

00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:22.970
on that precise state, psi 1.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:25.260
Let's see how much is it.

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.440
You see, psi 1 is
a particular state.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:33.310
We've called it an
eigenstate of the operator.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.590
Now you can ask, suppose
you live in psi 1?

00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:40.740
That's who you are,
that's your state.

00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:44.910
What is the expectation
value of this operator?

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:50.490
So we'll learn more about
this question later,

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:58.860
but we can just do it, it's the
integral of dx psi 1 Q psi 1.

00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.000
And I keep forgetting
these stars,

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.830
but I remember them
after a little while.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:17.760
So at this moment, we can
use the eigenvalue condition,

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.710
this condition
here, that this is

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:26.090
equal to dx psi 1 star Q1 psi 1.

00:12:30.965 --> 00:12:40.612
And the Q1 can go out,
hence Q 1 integral dx of psi

00:12:40.612 --> 00:12:42.515
1 star psi 1.

00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:52.225
But now, we've proven,
in claim number one,

00:12:52.225 --> 00:12:56.950
that the expectation
value of Q is always real,

00:12:56.950 --> 00:12:58.820
whatever state you take.

00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.000
So it must be real if you
take it on the state psi 1.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.490
And if the expectation
value of psi 1 is real,

00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:10.650
then this quantity, which
is equal to that expectation

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:12.500
value, must be real.

00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.230
This quantity is the
product of two factors.

00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:19.080
A real factor here--

00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:22.850
that integral is not only
real, it's even positive--

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.610
times Q1.

00:13:24.610 --> 00:13:32.170
So if this is real, then
because this part is real,

00:13:32.170 --> 00:13:34.600
the other number must be real.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:37.963
Therefore, Q1 is real.

00:13:43.890 --> 00:13:48.340
Now it's an
interesting observation

00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:54.230
that if your eigenstate,
eigenfunction

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:58.500
is a normalized eigenfunction,
look at the eigenfunction

00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:00.130
equation.

00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:05.105
It doesn't depend on what
precise psi 1 you have,

00:14:05.105 --> 00:14:09.160
because if you put psi 1
or you put twice psi 1,

00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.540
this equation still holds.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:17.220
So if it hold for psi 1, if psi
1 is called an ideal function,

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:24.160
3 psi 1, 5 psi 1, minus psi
1 are all eigenfunctions.

00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.090
Properly speaking
in mathematics,

00:14:26.090 --> 00:14:28.660
one says that the
eigenfunction is

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:34.460
the subspace generated by
this thing, by multiplication.

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:36.670
Because everything is accepted.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:39.320
But when we talk
about the particle

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.830
maybe being in the
state of psi 1,

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:47.620
we would want to normalize it,
to make psi 1 integral squared

00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.120
equal to 1.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:52.666
In that case, you would
obtain that the expectation

00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:57.680
value of the operator
on that state

00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.010
is precisely the eigenvalue.

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:07.290
When you keep measuring
this operator, this state,

00:15:07.290 --> 00:15:10.090
you keep getting the eigenvalue.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:22.888
So I'll think about the
common for a normalized psi

00:15:22.888 --> 00:15:28.996
1 as a true state that you
use for expectation values.

00:15:28.996 --> 00:15:32.530
In fact, whenever we
compute expectation values,

00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:34.530
here is probably a
very important thing.

00:15:34.530 --> 00:15:37.730
Whenever you compute
an expectation value,

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:42.740
you'd better normalize the
state, because otherwise,

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:45.970
think of the expectation value.

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:48.660
If you don't normalize the
state, you the calculation

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:51.550
and you get some
answer, but your friend

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:55.686
uses a wave function three
times yours and your friend

00:15:55.686 --> 00:15:57.460
gets now nine times your answer.

00:15:57.460 --> 00:16:01.780
So for this to be a
well-defined calculation,

00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:04.270
the state must be normalized.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:09.620
So here, we should really say
that the state is normalized.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:14.070
Say one is the ideal
function normalized.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:22.735
And this integral would be equal
to Q1 belonging to the reals.

00:16:25.305 --> 00:16:27.900
And Q1 is real.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.790
So for a normalized psi
1 or how it should be,

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:36.280
the expectation value
of Q on that eigenstate

00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:40.560
is precisely equal
to the eigenvalue.

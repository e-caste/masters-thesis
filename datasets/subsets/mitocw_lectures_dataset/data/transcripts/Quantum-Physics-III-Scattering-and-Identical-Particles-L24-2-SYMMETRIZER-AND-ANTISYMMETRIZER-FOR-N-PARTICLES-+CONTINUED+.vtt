WEBVTT

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.930
PROFESSOR: We can go
a step forward now.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.830
So we're trying to
understand these operators.

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.270
And the next claim is
that if you multiply

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:23.130
an arbitrary upward
permutation operator times S,

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.690
or you multiply on the
other side, it's the same.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.390
And in fact, it's just S. On
the other hand, if you multiply

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.750
by a permutation operator
A, it is still the same

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.940
as multiplying A from the right
with that permutation operator.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:50.420
But this time you get
epsilon alpha 0 times A.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.390
So this is a claim
of the simple way

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.640
in which permutation
operators interact with your A

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:14.190
and S. So here is, again,
the same kind of argument.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.880
We'll say it first.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:33.390
So P alpha 0 acting on the
list of permutation operators

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:40.920
just rearranges the list.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.350
We just argue that taking the
inverse of the permutation

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.810
operators just
rearranges the list.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.650
Multiplying by P
alpha 0 the list

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.430
of all permutation operators--

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.840
here you have all the
permutation operators.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.520
Now you multiply by P alpha 0.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.200
And then the claim is that
they just go somewhere

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.430
but you get the same
list at the end.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.900
Now that, again, you can
prove by the same argument.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.520
Show that two elements
that are different

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.090
here go to two elements
that are different.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.820
And any element
here can be written

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.780
as P alpha 0 of something here.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.270
I think you can do that.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.430
And it's a repeat of this kind
of argument we've been doing.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.320
So P alpha 0
rearranges the list.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.430
So that's a first thing.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.440
So therefore, let's
try one of these.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.790
So the first one, P alpha
0 on S. So all we can do

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.580
is use the formula
for S. So you have 1

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.060
over N factorial, the sum of.

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.470
S is the sum over
alpha of P alpha.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.300
But now we have P alpha 0.

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.780
And then we don't really
do much at this stage.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:28.330
We say, look, by this claim
that P alpha 0 rearranges

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.210
all the operators, this is
just another sum, P beta,

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.410
of all the operators.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.260
This P alpha 0 times P
alpha is another operator.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.160
But at the end of the job,
when you sum over alpha,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.860
you get just the
list rearranged.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.980
So here it is, the
list, rearranged.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:01.800
So this is back to S.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.450
For the A case--

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.380
let's do it.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.710
P alpha 0.

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.440
We have to work a little more.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.160
A is always a
little more subtle.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:17.290
1 over N factorial
alpha P alpha 0.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:25.565
But this time I have the epsilon
alpha of the A. P alpha 0 P

00:04:25.565 --> 00:04:26.065
alpha.

00:04:30.155 --> 00:04:30.655
OK.

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:42.120
To make this clear, I'm going to
put the sine factor two times.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.020
So we'll have sum over alpha.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.920
I'll put epsilon alpha.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.190
And then I'll put
epsilon alpha 0.

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.070
Then another epsilon alpha 0.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:01.840
Whatever epsilon alpha 0 is
I can do this because I'm

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.780
inserting just the 1 here.

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:10.670
And then we have
P alpha 0 P alpha.

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.675
Now look at this operator
and look at this sine factor.

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.330
A few things are clear here.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.440
This epsilon alpha 0 has
nothing to do with the sum.

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:38.190
So this epsilon alpha 0
can go out of the sum.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.200
And then you have a sum--

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:47.260
so 1 over N factorial
epsilon alpha 0.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:50.730
The sum of this
epsilon alpha epsilon

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:54.765
alpha 0 P alpha 0 P alpha.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:07.590
But here, it's clear that
if this is some P beta,

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.030
this sine factor is,
in fact, epsilon beta,

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.570
because if P beta
is made by these two

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:20.550
permutations of the sine
factor of that permutation,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.670
it's the product of
these two sine factors.

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:27.390
This is kind of clear
because it's just

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.920
a number of
transpositions again.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.530
This is counting the number
of transpositions mode two.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.170
This is counting the number
of transpositions mode two.

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:40.350
And this works like that.

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:42.600
If you have two
even permutations,

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.790
the product is an
even permutation.

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.370
And therefore, the two
pluses give you a plus.

00:06:47.370 --> 00:06:50.760
If one is even and one
is odd, the product

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.230
is an odd permutation, and
you have a 1 and a minus 1.

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:56.440
This product is minus 1.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:03.470
So this is an epsilon
beta P beta sum over beta.

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:08.090
And that is the antisymmetrizer.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:11.720
So you've got epsilon
alpha 0 in here,

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.210
and the rest is, again,
the antisymmetrizer.

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.470
So these two properties
have been proven.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.130
I've proven them when
P is from the left.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:27.390
The proof when P is from
the right is very similar.

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.320
Almost no changes.

00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:33.680
OK.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.520
Little by little,
these operators

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.770
are a little complicated
because they have lots of terms.

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:43.680
And therefore, manipulating
them requires some care.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.700
But now we're ready for the main
claim about these operators.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:54.140
We can do the
arithmetic with them,

00:07:54.140 --> 00:08:03.700
and finally say that A and
S are orthogonal projectors.

00:08:09.810 --> 00:08:11.410
So what does that mean?

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:18.390
It means that S squared is equal
to S, A squared is equal to A,

00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:23.420
and we'll also show that
they're orthogonal to each other

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:31.210
in that AS equal SA
equals 0 as well.

00:08:31.210 --> 00:08:36.270
So if you first apply the
symmetrization operator

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:40.140
to a state and then you
apply the antisymmetrization,

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:41.070
you get 0.

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:45.420
So once you symmetrize,
that symmetric state

00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.140
has no component along
the antisymmetric state.

00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.800
They're complementary.

00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:55.030
So this is really what you
want from these operators.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.400
They're doing the right job.

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:01.800
So this is the last thing
we need to prove about them.

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:07.060
But by now, we really
have worked quite well.

00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:09.520
So it's going to be simple.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.840
The other statement, of course,
of orthogonal projectors

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.920
also includes the fact that
they are Hermitian operators.

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:21.000
So we already showed
that they are Hermitian,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.010
so we're almost there.

00:09:23.010 --> 00:09:26.980
We just need to prove that
these two things happen.

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:31.080
So let's see how
difficult or easy this is.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:36.960
So first case, the S squared
equal S. S squared is

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:46.920
S times S, so I will write
it as one S, here, acting

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:52.670
on the other S.
Now, the next step

00:09:52.670 --> 00:10:02.675
is just erasing this
parenthesis over alpha.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:09.580
And now we have it there.

00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:19.990
The product of any
projector times S is S.

00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:23.380
So projector in alpha
is just S. So we'll

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:29.590
have 1 over N factorial,
the sum over alpha of S.

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:34.150
But S has no alpha index.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:37.370
So it goes out of the sum.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:43.200
It's equal to S times 1 over N
factorial, the sum over alpha

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:43.900
of 1.

00:10:46.770 --> 00:10:50.790
And the sum over alpha
of 1 is a 1 added

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.140
for each element of the
permutation group, which

00:10:55.140 --> 00:10:57.690
is N factorial elements.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:01.080
Therefore, this
sum is N factorial.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.990
And therefore, this cancels
with that N factorial

00:11:04.990 --> 00:11:09.290
and we get S, as we wanted.

00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:14.480
So S squared is S. It
is a projector operator.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.250
That's good.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.620
Let's do the second.

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:28.400
A squared is going to be 1 over
N factorial sum epsilon alpha P

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:39.788
alpha acting on an antisymmetric
A. So this is the first A,

00:11:39.788 --> 00:11:45.050
and there's the second A. I
should put the sum over alpha.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:51.860
But we already
calculated P alpha on A.

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:55.430
This is sum over
alpha epsilon alpha.

00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:59.390
And P alpha on A was
calculated on that board.

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:04.730
It's just another
epsilon alpha times A.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:07.220
Well, epsilon alpha
times epsilon alpha,

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:12.900
whether is 1 or minus 1,
the product is just plus 1.

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:16.130
So you get 1 over N factorial.

00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.900
And again, the sum over
alpha of A, the A goes out.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:29.710
Sum over alpha of 1,
and we're back to A.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:34.920
So A squared is also A.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:41.520
Finally, let's do one of
those mixed products, three.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:46.950
A multiplied with
S. So as usual,

00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.950
we write the first
operator explicitly.

00:12:49.950 --> 00:13:02.330
Epsilon alpha P alpha on S. But
P alpha on S, we know already,

00:13:02.330 --> 00:13:08.060
is just S. So 1
over N factorial sum

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:15.840
over alpha epsilon
alpha times S.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:17.610
The S goes out.

00:13:17.610 --> 00:13:27.600
1 over N factorial S sum
over alpha of epsilon alpha.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:31.890
That's as far as we
can simplify this.

00:13:31.890 --> 00:13:38.380
And then we recall, in
any permutation group Sn,

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.810
the number of even
permutations is

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:43.790
equal to the number
of odd permutations.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:47.500
So there is equal
number of pluses

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:51.660
and equal number of
minuses in that sum.

00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.160
So this sum is equal to 0.

00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.230
And therefore, this result is 0.

00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:05.500
The operators are orthogonal,
and they will do the job.

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:10.480
So good.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.650
We have orthogonal operators.

00:14:12.650 --> 00:14:19.910
And therefore, we can do with
these projectors what you would

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:23.510
expect we should be able to do.

00:14:23.510 --> 00:14:26.030
So here it is, the
last statement.

00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:40.220
S takes V tensor
N to Sym N of V.

00:14:40.220 --> 00:14:43.250
It's a projector to
the symmetric states.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:44.960
Why is that?

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:52.070
Well, take a psi belonging
to V tensor N. Then

00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:57.870
consider S on psi.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:02.120
That's the operator, S,
acting on the state, psi.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.120
And that should be
a symmetric state.

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:13.790
And to check that it's symmetric
we apply a P alpha on S psi.

00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:18.980
But P alpha on S is S,
so that's just S psi.

00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:25.820
So the state of psi
is independent--

00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.720
unchanged-- by the
action of the P alpha.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.380
So the state S psi is, indeed--

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:42.670
this implies that S psi
belongs to Sym N V, as claimed.

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:49.990
So the operator does
what you wanted it to do.

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:54.500
This property helps
for the other one.

00:15:54.500 --> 00:16:02.440
So A is an operator that takes
arbitrary states in the tensor

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:09.340
product to anti N V.
So indeed, if, again,

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:16.270
you have some psi in V N,
you can then form A psi

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.050
and see where it lies.

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:22.255
For that you apply
P alpha on A psi.

00:16:25.390 --> 00:16:29.800
But P alpha on A from
that middle blackboard

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:36.490
is epsilon alpha A psi.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:40.300
But that is precisely
the definition

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.310
of an antisymmetric state.

00:16:47.780 --> 00:16:55.670
So indeed, A takes states
to antisymmetric states.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:17:06.849
If you think of the vector
space V tensor N here,

00:17:06.849 --> 00:17:15.780
there's some subspace here, Sym
N V, and some subspace here,

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:23.040
anti N V. And
these two subspaces

00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.859
don't contain any
common element.

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:32.310
Maybe I should--
well, I don't know.

00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:36.150
Maybe I should really make
them touch at one point.

00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:39.100
That point would be what vector?

00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:40.330
AUDIENCE: 0?

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:41.040
PROFESSOR: 0.

00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.520
Yes.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:48.010
If you have a vector subspace
it has to have the 0 vector.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:51.450
So here is the 0 vector.

00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:00.140
But they don't fill
the whole thing.

00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.810
In general, they don't
fill the whole thing.

00:18:06.310 --> 00:18:10.730
When you have two particle
states, however, they do.

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:16.550
Remember when we
had N equals 2, we

00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:24.290
had the symmetrizer
was 1 plus P 2 1.

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:30.440
And A was 1/2 1 minus P 2 1.

00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:36.620
In that case, the symmetrizer
plus the antisymmetrizer

00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.270
was equal to 1.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:42.560
But this is only
for two particles.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:47.760
If you have three particles,
this will not work.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:52.772
Suppose I get three particles--
maybe I'll use this blackboard.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:20.660
And the fact that S plus A
is equal to the unit operator

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:22.880
means something, of course.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.880
It means that still
for N equals 2,

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:30.520
means that any
vector can be written

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:37.660
as S plus A times the
vector, because this is 1.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:43.210
And therefore, it's SV plus AV.

00:19:43.210 --> 00:19:50.470
So any vector where V belongs to
the tensor product, because you

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:54.760
have two particles, can be
written as a symmetric state

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.980
plus an antisymmetric state.

00:19:56.980 --> 00:20:00.430
That is the statement
that the symmetric states

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:04.550
plus the antisymmetric
state span the space.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:08.650
So that is true
for N equals to 2.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:15.520
So in N equals to 2, the
two states, the two spaces,

00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.615
span the space.

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:26.730
On the other hand, for N
equals to 3, remember we had--

00:20:26.730 --> 00:20:30.420
and this is a good way to
write some things explicitly.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:34.290
If you have N equals to 3,
you have the permutation 1 2

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:39.990
3, which is the identity,
the permutation 3 1 2,

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.640
the permutation of 2 3 1.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:49.360
All these were
even permutations.

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:55.930
This is original, and this can
be built with two permutations.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:21:02.125
Then you have P 1 3 2,
where you flip just 2 and 3.

00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:05.240
This has one transposition.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.060
You can cycle them.

00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:09.354
3 2 1.

00:21:09.354 --> 00:21:10.180
P 2 1 3.

00:21:14.365 --> 00:21:20.890
These are the even, and here
are the odd permutations.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:28.940
So this was for three particles.

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.420
Six operators, three
even, three odd.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:35.580
So what is the symmetrizer?

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:39.570
The symmetrizer, 1
over 3 factorial.

00:21:39.570 --> 00:21:40.590
And you should sum.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.990
So it's 1 over 3
factorial, which is 6.

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:54.700
The 1 plus P 3 1 2 plus P 2 3 1.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.750
I keep adding.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:58.280
You should add all of them.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.255
Plus P 3 2 1 plus P 2 1 3.

00:22:02.255 --> 00:22:03.860
Boom.

00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:04.600
That's it.

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.690
All the ones, you
have to add them.

00:22:07.690 --> 00:22:12.560
What is A is 1/6.

00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.320
You add the ones that are even.

00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:22.920
1 plus P 3 1 2 plus P
2 1 3, and you subtract

00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:24.660
all the ones that are odd.

00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:31.560
So you minus P 1 3 2 minus
P 3 2 1 minus P 2 1 3.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:42.130
So those are the two operators
in case you wanted to see them.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:53.350
But now notice that A plus S
is equal to 1/3 1 plus P 3 1 2

00:22:53.350 --> 00:22:56.560
plus P 2 3 1.

00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:02.380
And that's not the equal to
the identity, as it was before.

00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.090
It's equal to something else.

00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:11.440
So you cannot say that the
vector is equal to A plus S

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:12.430
times the vector.

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:15.820
That's not true here.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.020
Doesn't happen.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:22.390
So there is more to
the triple tensor

00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:24.580
product than the
symmetric states

00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.100
and the antisymmetric states.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:31.780
That's a nice subject for a
slightly more advanced course

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:36.220
in quantum mechanics where you
studying the Young tableaux

00:23:36.220 --> 00:23:38.540
of the permutation group.

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:44.650
And while for two things, two
objects that are represented

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.600
with Young tableaux
with little squares,

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.190
you can form something
that is called

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:54.570
symmetric and antisymmetric,
for three objects you

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:58.440
can form a symmetric
object, you can

00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.710
form an antisymmetric
object, but you can

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:07.800
form a mixed symmetry object.

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:10.450
And this Young
tableaux represent

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:13.160
the tensors that enter here.

00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:16.610
There are other projectors
to this kind of object.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:20.180
These objects are not
symmetric nor antisymmetric.

00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:24.610
They have partial symmetry
and partial antisymmetry.

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:29.620
And they take a while to get
around to visualize them.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:34.060
But that's why the permutation
group is interesting

00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:39.290
and why we try to understand
it better and better.

00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:46.840
So that's basically
the mathematics

00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.510
that we need for
understanding permutations.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:24:52.960
So we're going to do
some of the physics that

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.680
follows from this now.

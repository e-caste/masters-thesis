00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.170
MARKUS KLUTE: Welcome back
to 8.20 Special Relativity.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.110
In this section, we're going
to talk about particles

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.370
and accelerators.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.430
And we use the Large
Electron-Positron Collider

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.320
at CERN as an example.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.020
LEP, the Large
Electron-Positron Collider,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.640
was a collider which was
operated in the late 1980s

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.420
up to the year 2000 at
center-of-mass energies

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.610
from 91 GeV up to 209 GeV.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.440
These energies
were used to probe

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.650
the Z boson to produce
pairs of W boson

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.260
and also to look for the Higgs
boson, which didn't quite

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.720
work because its energy
wasn't quite sufficient.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.440
The 27-kilometer over
a 16-mile circumference

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.490
collider is now the home of the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:04.680
And it's being used there to
collide protons with protons.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.420
LEP had four experiments,
ALEPH, DELPHI, L3, and OPAL.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.040
And I was happy to study data
from the particle as part

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.890
of my undergraduate thesis.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.040
So this was very
good memories there.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.490
But that's not the topic today.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.260
So the topic today is
to find out how quickly,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.410
how fast the particles
in the collider

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.150
are moving when we know
the center-of-mass energy.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.070
So we know the center-of-mass
energy to be 209 GeV.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.440
We know that the
energy in the beam

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.210
is half of that, 104.5 GeV.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.780
So now to figure out how fast
the electrons are moving--

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.550
the electrons and
the positrons--

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:51.480
we can use our relativistic
total energy for the electron

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.750
or for the positron, which
is the kinetic energy

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.890
plus the rest mass of the
electron or positron, which

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.640
is M0 gamma times c square.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.120
So with a mass of 511
KeV over c square,

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.680
and this energy
of 104.5 GeV, this

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.250
results in a gamma
factor of 200,000.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.840
And if you do the
math, you'll find

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.390
that electrons and
positrons are almost

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.750
moving with the speed of light.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.410
They're moving with the
speed of light [INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.810
A fun additional fact is
we are working right now

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.010
on proposing a even
larger collider, which

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.080
will then allow us
to efficiently go up

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.360
to energies of 350 GeV.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.430
And that collider then will be
able to study the Higgs boson

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.520
with precision but also look
at [INAUDIBLE] production--

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.470
[INAUDIBLE] production in
these kind of colliders.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.170
Another fun fact is
that CERN, the collider,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.990
which is about 100
meters under the surface,

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.440
is spanning two countries,
Switzerland and France.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.930
And so each particle,
lep, when we make the lep,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.500
makes about 11,200
leps per second.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.520
That means that there is
about 44,800 border crossings

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.350
for an electron and positron.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.312
So they always constantly have
to show their passport when

00:03:15.312 --> 00:03:16.520
they're moving around in LEP.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.710
To look at a second example
here with a small accelerator,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.810
we can accelerate
electrons through

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.920
an electrostatic potential
of 511 kilovolts or 0.511

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.810
megavolts.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.150
The total energy then is,
again, the kinetic energy

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.270
plus the rest energy,
which is, in this example,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.340
4.511 MeV plus 0.511 MeV.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.830
And so here we find
the gamma factor of 2

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.010
and a velocity of 0.866.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.810
So even in this smaller
electrostatic potential

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.480
of 500 kilovolts, we
find that electrons

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.630
are moving with
very high velocities

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.320
with velocities very close
to the speed of light.

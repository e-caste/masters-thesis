00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.360
PROFESSOR: In the last two
lectures, we saw how periodic

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.300
and non periodic signals could
be represented as linear

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.440
combinations of complex
exponentials.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.570
And this led to the Fourier
series representation, in the

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.280
periodic case, and it led
to the Fourier transform

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.950
representation in the
aperiodic case.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.340
And then, in fact, what we did
was to incorporate the Fourier

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.480
series within the framework
of the Fourier transform.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.350
What I'd like to do in today's
lecture is look at the Fourier

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.620
transform more closely, in
particular with regard to some

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.050
of its properties.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.460
So let me begin by reminding
you of the analysis and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.020
synthesis equations for the
Fourier transform, as I've

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.350
summarized them here.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.550
The synthesis equation being an
equation the tells us how

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.970
to build the time function out
of, in essence, a linear

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.060
combination of complex
exponentials.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.390
And the analysis equation
telling us how to get the

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.820
amplitudes of those complex
exponentials from the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.970
associated time function.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.360
So essentially, in the
decomposition of x of t as a

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.270
linear combination of complex
exponentials, the complex

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.560
amplitudes of those are, in
effect, the Fourier transform

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.670
scaled by the differential and
scaled by 1 over 2 pi.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.730
As I indicated last time, the
Fourier transform is a complex

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.810
function of frequency.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.490
And in particular, the complex
function of frequency has an

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.770
important and very useful
symmetry property.

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:49.030
The symmetry of the Fourier
transform, when x of t is

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.450
real, is what is referred to
as conjugate symmetric.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.940
In other words, if we take the
complex function, f of omega,

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.970
and its complex conjugate,
that's equivalent to replacing

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.930
omega by minus omega.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.300
And a consequence of that, if we
think in terms of the real

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.890
part of the Fourier transform,
the real part is an even

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.730
function of frequency, and the
magnitude is an even function

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.370
of frequency.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.550
Whereas the imaginary part is an
odd function of frequency,

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:31.170
and the phase angle is an odd
function of frequency.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.450
So we have this symmetry
relationship that, for x of t

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.390
real, if we think of either the
real part or the magnitude

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.880
of the Fourier transform,
it's even symmetric.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.100
And the imaginary part, or the
phase angle, either one, is

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.310
odd symmetric.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.740
In other words, if we flip it,
we multiply by a minus sign.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.260
Let's look at an example, in the
context of an example that

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.870
we worked last time for
the Fourier transform.

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.320
We took the case of a real
exponential of the form e to

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.550
the minus at times the step.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:17.120
And the Fourier transform, as we
found, was of the algebraic

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.089
form 1 over a plus j omega.

00:04:20.089 --> 00:04:23.580
And, incidentally, the Fourier
transform integral only

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.790
converged for a greater
than 0.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.250
In other words, for this
exponential decaying.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:34.810
And I illustrated the magnitude
and angle, and what

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.460
we see is that e to the minus
at is a real time function,

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.110
therefore its magnitude should
be an even function of

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.630
frequency, and indeed it is.

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.800
And its phase angle,
shown below, is an

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.050
odd function of frequency.

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:02.170
So in fact, although I stressed
last time that the

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.800
complex exponentials is required
to build a time

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.000
function require exponentials of
both positive and negative

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.160
frequencies, for x of t real
what we see is that, because

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.270
of these symmetry properties,
either for the real and

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.960
imaginary or magnitude and
angle, we can specify the

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.630
Fourier transform for, let's say
only positive frequencies,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.470
and the symmetry, then, implies,
or tells us, what the

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.850
Fourier transform, then, would
be for the negative

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.100
frequencies.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:39.480
This same example, the
decaying exponential,

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.320
demonstrates another important
and often useful property of

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.370
the Fourier transform.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:52.410
Specifically, let's rewrite,
algebraically, this example as

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.350
I indicate here.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:57.720
So we have, again, the
exponential, whose Fourier

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.800
transform is 1 over
a plus j omega.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.020
And if I just simply divide
numerator and denominator by

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.370
a, I can rewrite it in
the form shown here.

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:15.800
And what we notice is that in
the time function we have a

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.020
term of the form a times t, and
in the frequency function

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:24.630
we have a term of the form
omega divided by a.

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:30.390
Or equivalently, we could think
of the time function,

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:37.280
which I show here, and as the
parameter a gets smaller, the

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.300
exponential gets spread
out in time.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.880
Whereas its Fourier transform,
or the magnitude of its

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.080
Fourier transform, has the
inverse property that as a

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:56.840
gets smaller, in fact, this
scales down in frequency.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.430
Well, this is a general property
of the Fourier

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:06.350
transform, namely the fact that
a linear scaling in time

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:10.590
generates the inverse linear
scaling in frequency.

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:14.190
And the general statement of
this time frequency scaling is

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:18.100
what I show at the top of the
transparency, namely the

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:23.570
equation that if we scale the
time function in time, then we

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.140
apply an inverse scaling
in frequency.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.430
This, in fact, is probably a
result that you're already

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:35.580
possibly familiar with,
in somewhat

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.190
of a different context.

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:42.250
Essentially, you could think
of this as an example, or a

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.700
generalization, rather, of the
notion that if, let's say I

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:53.610
had a signal that was recorded
on a tape player, and if I

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:57.140
play the tape back at, let's
say, twice the speed, which

00:07:57.140 --> 00:08:00.380
means that I'm compressing
the time axis linearly

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.240
by a factor of 2.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.280
Then, in fact, what happens is
that the frequencies that we

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.930
observe get pushed up
by a factor of 2.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:12.450
And, in fact, let me
illustrate that.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:18.670
I have here a glockenspiel, and
anyone who loves a parade

00:08:18.670 --> 00:08:22.610
certainly knows what
a glockenspiel is.

00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:28.700
And this particular glockenspiel
has three a's,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.360
separated each by an octave.

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:35.500
There's a middle a, a
high a, and a low a.

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:46.240
And what I've done is to record
the middle a on a tape

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.950
at 7 and 1/2 inches
per second.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:54.680
And what I'd like to demonstrate
is that as we play

00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.790
that back, either at twice or
half speed, the effective note

00:08:59.790 --> 00:09:03.650
gets moved down or
up by an octave.

00:09:03.650 --> 00:09:07.340
So let me first play the
note at the speed at

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.760
which it was recorded.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.250
And so what we'll hear is the
middle a as I've recorded it.

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:15.200
And let me just start
the tape player.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.190
Let me stop it, and hopefully
what you heard is the same

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:33.930
note from the tape recorder as
the note that I played on the

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:35.980
glockenspiel.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:40.740
Now I'll rewind the tape, and
we'll go back to the beginning

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.700
of that portion.

00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:49.930
And now, if I change the tape
speed to half the speed, so

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:53.050
from 7 and 1/2 inches per
second, I'll change the tape

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:57.980
speed to 3 and 3/4 inches
per second.

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:04.820
And now when I play the tape
back, because of the inverse

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.060
relationship between time and
frequency scaling, we're now

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.750
scaling in time by stretching
out, we would expect the

00:10:10.750 --> 00:10:13.770
frequencies to be lowered
by a factor of 2.

00:10:13.770 --> 00:10:19.170
We should now expect the taped
note to be an octave lower,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:20.390
matching this lower a.

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.010
So let's just play that.

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.795
Let me stop it, and, again,
we'll rewind the tape.

00:10:46.410 --> 00:10:50.020
Go back to the beginning,
and now we'll play this

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.770
at twice the speed.

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:57.310
So I'll change from 3 and 3/4
to 15 inches per second.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.680
And now when I play it, we would
expect that to match the

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:01.180
upper note.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.430
And let's just do that.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.980
Although that's a result that,
intuitively, probably makes

00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.720
considerable sense, in fact,
what that is is an

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:27.130
illustration of the inverse
relationship between time

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.250
scaling and frequency scaling.

00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.970
And also, by the way, it was
finally my opportunity to play

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.220
the glockenspiel
on television.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:42.300
In addition, there is another
very important relationship

00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:45.810
between the time and frequency
domains, namely what is

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:50.150
referred to as a duality
relationship.

00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:56.660
And the duality relationship
between time and frequency

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:01.220
falls out, more or less
directly, from the equations,

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.790
the analysis and synthesis
equations.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.470
In particular, if we look at the
synthesis equation, which

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:12.760
I repeat here, and the analysis
equation, which I

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:17.510
repeat below it, what we observe
is that, in fact,

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:23.420
these equations are basically
identical, except for the fact

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.870
that in the top integral we have
things as a function of

00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:30.320
omega, in the bottom integral
as a function of t, and

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.960
there's a factor of 1 over
2 pi, and, by the

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.590
way, a minus sign.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.500
You can look at the algebra
more carefully at your

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.920
leisure, but essentially what
this says is that if x of

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:51.420
omega is the Fourier transform
of a time function x of t,

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:58.120
then, in fact, x of t is very
much like the Fourier

00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.180
transform of x of omega.

00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:04.060
In fact, it's the Fourier
transform of x of minus omega

00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:06.060
to account for this
minus sign.

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:07.800
And, by the way, there's
just an additional

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.550
factor of 1 over 2 pi.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:14.070
So the duality relationship
which follows from these two

00:13:14.070 --> 00:13:21.450
equations, in fact, says that if
x of t and x of omega are a

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:26.360
Fourier transform pair, if x and
X are a Fourier transform

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:32.150
pair, then X, in fact, has a
Fourier transform which is

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:35.910
proportional to x
turned around.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:40.060
This duality in the continuous
time Fourier

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:42.560
transform is very important.

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.110
It's very useful.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:48.590
It, by the way, is not a duality
that surfaced in the

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:52.620
Fourier series, because, as you
recall, the Fourier series

00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:58.250
begins with a continuous time
function and in the frequency

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:02.470
domain generates a sequence,
which would just naturally

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.630
have problems associated with
it if we attempted to

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:08.580
interpret a duality.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.130
And we'll see, also, that in the
discrete time case, one of

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.560
the important differences
between continuous time and

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.250
discrete time Fourier transforms
is the fact that in

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:23.950
continuous time we have duality,
in the discrete time

00:14:23.950 --> 00:14:27.330
Fourier transform we don't.

00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:32.400
Let's illustrate this
with an example.

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.000
Here are, in fact, two examples
of Fourier transform

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.460
pairs taken from examples
in the text.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:46.690
The top one being example 4.11
from the text, and it's a time

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:52.310
function which is a sine x
over x type of function.

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:59.710
And its Fourier transform
corresponds to a rectangular

00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:03.830
shape in the frequency domain.

00:15:03.830 --> 00:15:07.320
There's also another example in
the text, the example that

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.590
precedes this one, which
is example 4.10.

00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:17.460
And in example 4.10, we begin
with a rectangle, and its

00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.340
Fourier transform is
of the form of a

00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:24.140
sine x over x function.

00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:28.980
So in fact, if we look at these
two examples together,

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:33.260
what we see is the duality
very evident.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:38.390
In other words, if we take this
time function and instead

00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:42.260
think of a frequency function
that has the same form, then

00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:45.360
we simply interchange the roles
of time and frequency in

00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.630
the other domains.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:50.810
So the fact that these two
correspond means that these

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:52.330
two correspond.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:57.910
Of course in this particular
example, because of the fact

00:15:57.910 --> 00:16:01.290
that we picked a symmetric
function, an even function, in

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:05.530
fact, the additional twist of
the time axis being reversed

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:10.830
didn't show up in duality
with this example.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.930
One thing this says, of course,
is that essentially

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:19.390
any time you've calculated the
Fourier transform of one time

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:23.290
function, then you've actually
calculated the Fourier

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:25.990
transform of two
time functions.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.970
Another one being the dual
example to the one that you

00:16:28.970 --> 00:16:30.220
just calculated.

00:16:32.370 --> 00:16:37.805
Also somewhat related to duality
is what is referred to

00:16:37.805 --> 00:16:41.650
as Parseval's relation
for the continuous

00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.620
time Fourier transform.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:47.880
And essentially, what Parseval's
relationship says,

00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:55.800
as a summary of it, says that
the energy in a time function

00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.260
and the energy in its Fourier
transform are proportional,

00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:04.430
the proportionality factor
being a factor of 2 pi.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:06.770
That's summarized here.

00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:10.190
What's meant by the energy is,
of course, the integral of the

00:17:10.190 --> 00:17:13.010
magnitude squared of x of t.

00:17:13.010 --> 00:17:16.819
And the statement of Parseval's
relation is that

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:21.670
that integral, the energy in x
of t, is proportional to this

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:25.770
integral, which is the
energy in x of omega.

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:31.660
Although we've incorporated the
Fourier series within a

00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:36.460
framework of the Fourier
transform, Parseval's relation

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:40.830
needs to be modified slightly
for Fourier series, because of

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:43.840
the fact that a periodic signal
has an infinite amount

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.930
of energy in it, and,
essentially, that form of

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.380
Parseval's relationship for the
periodic case would say

00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:53.560
infinity equals infinity,
which isn't too useful.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:57.320
However, it can be modified so
that Parseval's relationship

00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:02.760
to the periodic case says,
essentially, that the energy

00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:09.740
in one period of the periodic
time function is proportional

00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:12.160
with, this is the
proportionality factor,

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.870
proportional to the sum of the
magnitude squared of the

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:17.020
coefficients.

00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:21.300
In other words, the energy in
one period is proportional to

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.580
the energy in the sequence that
represents the Fourier

00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:26.830
series coefficients.

00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:34.070
There are lots of other
properties, and they're

00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:37.180
developed in the text and
in the study guide.

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:42.170
A number of properties that we
want to make particular use of

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:46.100
during this lecture, and in
later lectures, are ones that

00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:48.080
I summarize here.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:54.200
And I won't demonstrate the
proofs, but principally focus

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.630
on some of the interpretation
as the lecture goes on.

00:18:58.630 --> 00:19:01.760
The first property that I have
listed here is what's referred

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.600
to as the time shifting
property.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:08.470
And the time shifting property
says, if I have a time

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:13.610
function with a Fourier
transform x of omega, if I

00:19:13.610 --> 00:19:19.950
shift that time function in
time, then that corresponds to

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:24.440
multiplying the Fourier
transform by this factor.

00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:29.310
As you examine this factor, what
you can see is that this

00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:34.300
factor has magnitude unity and
it has a phase, which is

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:39.740
linear with frequency, and
a slope of minus t0.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:43.730
So a statement to remember, that
will come up many times

00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:49.010
throughout the course, is
that a time shift, or a

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:58.190
displacement in time,
corresponds to a linear change

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:01.110
in phase and frequency.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:06.020
Another property and, in fact,
a pair of properties that

00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:09.840
we'll make reference to as we
turn our attention toward the

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.660
end of this lecture to solving
differential equations using

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:18.920
the Fourier transform, is what's
referred to as the

00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:23.790
differentiation property and
its companion, which is the

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.600
integration property.

00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.700
The differentiation property
says, again, if we have a time

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.950
function with Fourier transform
x of omega, the

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:41.470
Fourier transform of the time
derivative of that corresponds

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:45.950
to multiplying the Fourier
transform by a linear function

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:46.940
of frequency.

00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.460
So here it's a linear amplitude
change that

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.470
corresponds to differentiation.

00:20:55.470 --> 00:20:59.500
At first glance, what you
might think is that the

00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.230
integration property is just
the reverse of that.

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:05.030
If for the differentiation
property you multiply by j

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:09.150
omega, then for integration you
must divide by j omega.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:12.460
And that's almost correct,
except not quite.

00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:16.930
And the reason for the not quite
is that recall that if

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.400
you differentiate, what happens,
of course, is that

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.970
you lose a constant.

00:21:21.970 --> 00:21:25.450
And if we have a time function
that's some finite energy

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:29.520
signal plus a constant,
differentiating will destroy

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:32.250
the constant.

00:21:32.250 --> 00:21:34.000
The integration property,
in essence, tries

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.300
to bring that back.

00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:39.730
So the integration property,
which is the inverse of the

00:21:39.730 --> 00:21:44.450
differentiation property, says
that we divide the transform

00:21:44.450 --> 00:21:50.610
by j omega, and then if, in
fact, there was a constant

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:54.600
added to x of t, we have to
account for that by inserting

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:58.220
an impulse into the
Fourier transform.

00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:03.370
And the final property that I
want to draw your attention to

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:08.090
on this view graph is the
linearity property, which is

00:22:08.090 --> 00:22:11.320
very straightforward to
demonstrate from the analysis

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:17.010
and synthesis equations, which
simply says if x1 of omega is

00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:21.120
the Fourier transform x1 of t,
and x2 of omega is the Fourier

00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:25.080
transform of x2 of t, then the
Fourier transform of a linear

00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:29.370
combination is a linear
combination of the Fourier

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:30.620
transforms.

00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:36.370
Let me emphasize, also, that
these properties, for the most

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:40.310
part, apply both to Fourier
series and Fourier transforms

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:44.530
because, in fact, what we've
done is to incorporate the

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:48.260
Fourier series within
the framework

00:22:48.260 --> 00:22:49.510
of the Fourier transform.

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.970
We'll be using a number of these
properties shortly, when

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.740
we turn our attention to linear
constant coefficient

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.350
differential equations.

00:22:59.350 --> 00:23:03.670
However, before we do that
I'd like to focus on two

00:23:03.670 --> 00:23:10.010
additional major properties, and
these are what I refer to

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:13.780
as the convolution property and
the modulation property.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.610
And in fact, the convolution
property, as I'm about to

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:22.090
introduce it, forms the
mathematical and conceptual

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:27.250
basis for the whole notion of
filtering, which, in fact,

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:32.810
will be a topic by itself in a
set of lectures, and, in fact,

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:36.700
is a chapter by itself
in the textbook.

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:40.220
Similarly, what I'll refer to
as the modulation property,

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:45.130
again, will occupy its own set
of lectures as we go through

00:23:45.130 --> 00:23:49.060
the course, and, in
fact, has its own

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.160
chapter in the textbook.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:58.450
Let me just indicate what the
convolution property is.

00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:08.870
And what the convolution
property tells us is that the

00:24:08.870 --> 00:24:13.050
Fourier transform of the
convolution of two time

00:24:13.050 --> 00:24:19.620
functions is the product of
their Fourier transforms.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:25.340
So it says, for example, that
if I have a linear time

00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:30.500
invariant system, and I have
an input x of t, an impulse

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.550
response h of t, and the output,
of course, being the

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:38.280
convolution, then, in fact,
if I look at this in the

00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:45.200
frequency domain, the Fourier
transform of the output is the

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.920
Fourier transform of the input
times the Fourier transform of

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.190
the impulse response.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:58.340
You can demonstrate this
property algebraically by

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.990
essentially taking the
convolution integral and

00:25:00.990 --> 00:25:04.270
applying the Fourier transform
and doing the appropriate

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.510
interchanging of the order of
integration, et cetera.

00:25:08.510 --> 00:25:13.000
But what I'd like to draw your
attention to is a somewhat

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.560
more intuitive interpretation
of the property.

00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:20.070
And the intuitive interpretation
stems from the

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:23.720
relationship between the Fourier
transform of the

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.890
impulse response and what
we've referred to as the

00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.840
frequency response.

00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:34.610
Recall that one of the things
that led us to use complex

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.910
exponentials as building blocks
was the fact that

00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:39.610
they're eigenfunctions
of linear

00:25:39.610 --> 00:25:41.000
time and variant systems.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.640
In other words, if we have a
linear time invariant system,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:48.990
and I have an input which is
a complex exponential, the

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:51.770
output is a complex exponential
of the same

00:25:51.770 --> 00:25:55.790
frequency multiplied
by what we call

00:25:55.790 --> 00:25:57.510
the frequency response.

00:25:57.510 --> 00:26:02.410
And, in fact, the expression for
the frequency response is

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:05.970
identical to the expression for
the Fourier transform of

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.710
the impulse response.

00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:11.670
In other words, the frequency
response is the Fourier

00:26:11.670 --> 00:26:15.750
transform of the impulse
response.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:20.350
Now in that context, how
can we interpret

00:26:20.350 --> 00:26:22.260
the convolution property?

00:26:22.260 --> 00:26:26.630
Well, remember what I said at
the beginning of the lecture,

00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:30.850
when I pointed to the synthesis
equation and I said,

00:26:30.850 --> 00:26:35.010
in essence, the synthesis
equation tells us how to

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:38.490
decompose x of t as a linear
combination of complex

00:26:38.490 --> 00:26:40.740
exponentials.

00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:43.460
What are the complex amplitudes
of those complex

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.020
exponentials?

00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:50.250
In terms of our notation here,
the complex amplitude of those

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:55.590
complex exponentials is x of
omega, or proportional to x of

00:26:55.590 --> 00:26:58.650
omega, in particular it's x of
omega, d omega, and then a

00:26:58.650 --> 00:27:01.160
factor of 2 pi.

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:06.480
As this signal goes through
this linear time invariant

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:12.100
system, what happens to each of
those exponential is each

00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:15.610
one gets multiplied by the
frequency response at the

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:18.090
associated frequency.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:22.770
What comes out is the amplitude
of the complex

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:28.610
exponentials that are used
to build the output.

00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:35.990
So in fact, the convolution
property simply is telling us

00:27:35.990 --> 00:27:39.730
that, in terms of the
decomposition of the signal,

00:27:39.730 --> 00:27:42.940
in terms of complex
exponentials, as we push that

00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.230
signal through a linear time
invariant system, we're

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:52.780
separately multiplying by the
frequency response, the

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.590
amplitudes of the exponential
components used

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.100
to build the input.

00:27:58.100 --> 00:28:03.860
And that sum, in turn, is the
decomposition of the output in

00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:05.270
terms of complex exponentials.

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:12.310
I understand that going through
that involves a little

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:16.640
bit of sorting out, and I
strongly encourage you to try

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.940
to understand and interpret the
convolution property in

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:25.400
those conceptual terms, rather
than simply by applying the

00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:29.050
mathematics to the convolution
integral and seeing the terms

00:28:29.050 --> 00:28:30.300
match up on both sides.

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:38.190
As I indicated, the convolution
property forms the

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.580
basis for what's referred
to as filtering.

00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:46.700
And this is a topic that we'll
be treating in a considerable

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:51.330
amount of detail after we've
also gone through a discussion

00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:54.400
of the discrete time Fourier
transform in the

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.050
next several lectures.

00:28:56.050 --> 00:28:59.600
However, what I'd like to do
is just indicate, now, a

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.560
little bit of the conceptual
ideas involved.

00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.990
Essentially, conceptually,
what filtering, as it's

00:29:08.990 --> 00:29:15.250
typically referred to,
corresponds to is modifying

00:29:15.250 --> 00:29:18.220
separately the individual
frequency

00:29:18.220 --> 00:29:20.030
components in a signal.

00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:25.360
The convolution property told
us that if we look at the

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:28.330
individual frequency components,
they get

00:29:28.330 --> 00:29:30.970
multiplied by the frequency
response, and so what that

00:29:30.970 --> 00:29:34.710
says is that we can amplify
or attenuate any of those

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:39.570
components separately using a
linear time invariant system.

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:43.050
For example, what I've
illustrated here is the

00:29:43.050 --> 00:29:47.320
frequency response of what is
commonly referred to as an

00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.220
ideal low pass filter.

00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:55.990
What an ideal low pass filter
does is to pass exactly

00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:01.200
frequencies in one frequency
range and eliminate totally

00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:04.350
frequencies outside
that range.

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:08.890
Another filter which is not so
ideal might, for example,

00:30:08.890 --> 00:30:15.980
attenuate components in
this band but not

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.230
totally eliminate them.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.190
In terms of filtering, we
can think back to the

00:30:22.190 --> 00:30:27.390
differentiation property
and, in fact, interpret

00:30:27.390 --> 00:30:29.680
differentiator as a filter.

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.710
Recall that the differentiation
property said

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:39.330
that the Fourier transform of
the differentiated signal is

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.180
the Fourier transform of
the original signal

00:30:41.180 --> 00:30:43.600
multiplied by j omega.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:47.060
So what that says, then,
is that if we have a

00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:52.490
differentiator, the frequency
response of that is j omega.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:55.640
In other words, the Fourier
transform of the output is j

00:30:55.640 --> 00:31:00.120
omega times the Fourier
transform of the input.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.640
And so the frequency response
of the differentiator looks

00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:07.140
like this, in terms
of its magnitude.

00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.700
And what it does, of course,
is it amplifies high

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.950
frequencies and attenuates
low frequencies.

00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:23.520
Let me just, to cement some of
these ideas, illustrate them

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:29.140
in the context of one kind of
signal, namely a signal which,

00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:34.170
in fact, is a spatial signal
rather than a time signal.

00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:39.270
And this also gives me an
opportunity to introduce you

00:31:39.270 --> 00:31:43.080
to our colleague, J.
B. J. Fourier.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.790
So if we could look at our
colleague, Mr. Fourier, who,

00:31:47.790 --> 00:31:53.500
by the way, is not only a person
who had tremendously

00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:59.140
brilliant insights, and his
insights, in fact, have led to

00:31:59.140 --> 00:32:02.670
forming the foundation of the
developments that is the basis

00:32:02.670 --> 00:32:04.040
for this course.

00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.730
He was also a very

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:07.560
interesting, fascinating person.

00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.830
And there's a certain amount of
historical discussion about

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:15.300
Fourier and his background,
which you might enjoy reading

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:17.120
in the text.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.740
In any case, what you're
looking at, of

00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:20.500
course, is a signal.

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:25.160
And the signal is a spatial
signal, and it has high

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.880
frequencies and low
frequencies.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.030
High frequencies corresponding
to things that are varying

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.310
rapidly spatially, and
low frequencies

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:37.810
varying slowly spatially.

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:43.250
And so, for example, we could
low pass filter this picture

00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:48.090
simply by asking the video crew
if they could be slightly

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:50.270
defocus it.

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:53.540
And what you see as the picture
is defocused, if you

00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:58.560
could hold it there, is that
we've lost edges, which is the

00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.230
rapid variation.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:05.020
And what we've retained is the
broader, slow variation.

00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:09.170
And now let's take out the
defocusing low pass filter and

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.550
go back to a focused image.

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.260
What we can also consider is
what would happen if we looked

00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:25.090
at the differentiated image.

00:33:25.090 --> 00:33:28.210
And there are several ways
we can think about this.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:30.580
One is that a differentiator--

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:35.400
Of course the output of a
differentiator is larger where

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:40.460
the discontinuity, or where
the variation, is faster.

00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:44.890
And so we would expect the edges
to be enhanced if, in

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.490
fact, we differentiated
the image.

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:51.200
Or if we interpret
differentiation in the context

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:59.190
of our filter, then what we're
saying is that, in effect,

00:33:59.190 --> 00:34:04.730
what's happening is that the
differentiator is accentuating

00:34:04.730 --> 00:34:08.130
the high frequencies because of
the frequency shape of the

00:34:08.130 --> 00:34:09.790
differentiator.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:13.940
Recall that this all fits
together as a nice package.

00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.120
We expect intuitively
that differentiation

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.020
will enhance edges.

00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.250
When we talked about square
waves and we saw how the

00:34:21.250 --> 00:34:25.380
Fourier series built up a square
wave, we saw that it

00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:29.420
was the high frequencies that
were required in order to

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:32.610
build up the sharp edges.

00:34:32.610 --> 00:34:36.250
And so either viewed as a
filter, or viewed intuitively,

00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:40.070
we would expect that the
differentiated image would, in

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:46.560
fact, attenuate this slowly
varying background and amplify

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.320
the rapidly varying edges.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:52.170
So let's look again at our
original image, just to remind

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.829
you of the fact that there are
edges, of course, and there is

00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:59.480
a more slowly varying
background.

00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:05.860
And now let's look at the result
of passing that through

00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:07.730
a differentiator.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:11.790
And, as I think is very evident
in the resulting

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:17.610
image, clearly it's the edges
that are retained and the

00:35:17.610 --> 00:35:21.590
slower background variations
are destroyed, which is

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:23.220
consistent with everything
that we've said.

00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:31.790
I've emphasized that we'll be
returning to a much broader

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:35.540
discussion of filtering at a
later point in the course.

00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.690
I'd now like to comment on
another property, which is

00:35:40.690 --> 00:35:44.110
also, as I indicated, a topic
in its own right, and which

00:35:44.110 --> 00:35:48.740
really is the dual property to
the convolution property, and,

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:53.360
in fact, could be argued
directly from duality.

00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:59.230
And that is what's referred to
as the modulation property.

00:35:59.230 --> 00:36:04.210
The convolution property told us
that if we convolve in the

00:36:04.210 --> 00:36:08.940
time domain, we multiply in
the frequency domain.

00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:10.920
And we know that time and
frequency domains are

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.920
interchangeable because of
duality, so what that would

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:19.860
suggest is that if we multiply
in the time domain, that would

00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.140
correspond to convolution
in the frequency domain.

00:36:23.140 --> 00:36:25.430
And, in fact, that is
exactly what the

00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:27.610
modulation property is.

00:36:27.610 --> 00:36:31.940
I have it summarized here that
if we multiply a time function

00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:34.340
by another time function,
then in the

00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:37.880
frequency domain we convolve.

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.850
Whereas the convolution property
is just the dual of

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:45.870
that, namely convolving in the
time domain corresponds to

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:49.040
multiplication in the
frequency domain.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.170
The convolution property
is the basis, as I

00:36:52.170 --> 00:36:54.390
indicated, for filtering.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:58.620
The modulation property, as I've
summarized it here, in

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:06.000
fact, is the entire basis for
amplitude modulation systems

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.080
as used almost universally
in communications.

00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:13.110
And what the modulation
property, as we'll see when we

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:18.300
explore it in more detail, tells
us is that if we have a

00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:22.560
signal with a certain spectrum,
and we multiply by a

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:27.020
sinusoidal signal whose Fourier
transform is a set of

00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:31.500
impulses, then in a frequency
domain we convolve.

00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.570
And that corresponds to taking
the original spectrum and

00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:41.160
translating it, shifting it in
frequency up to the frequency

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:45.060
of the carrier, namely the
sinusoidal signal.

00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:49.330
And as I said, we'll come to
that in much more detail in a

00:37:49.330 --> 00:37:50.580
number of lectures.

00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:56.780
We've seen a number of
properties, and I indicated

00:37:56.780 --> 00:38:00.100
sometime earlier when we talked
about differential

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.350
equations, that, in fact, it's
the properties of the Fourier

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:08.730
transform that provide us with
a very useful and important

00:38:08.730 --> 00:38:13.420
mechanism for solving linear
constant coefficient

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:15.350
differential equations.

00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:21.340
And what I'd like to do now is
illustrate the procedure, the

00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:24.780
basis for that, and I think what
we'll do is illustrate it

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:26.985
simply in the context
of several examples.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:39.380
What I've indicated is a
system with an impulse

00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:43.550
response h of t, or frequency
response h of omega.

00:38:43.550 --> 00:38:46.630
And, of course, we know that
in the time domain it's

00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:50.880
described through convolution,
in the frequency domain it's

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:54.020
described through
multiplication.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:59.040
And I, in essence, am assuming
that we're talking about a

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.400
linear time invariant system.

00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:05.560
And we're also going to assume
then it's characterized by a

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:09.540
linear constant coefficient
differential equation, where

00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:13.730
we're going to impose the
condition that it's causal

00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:17.760
linear and time invariant, or
equivalently that the initial

00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:22.320
conditions are consistent
with the initial rest.

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.160
And it's because of the fact
that we're assuming that it's

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.380
a linear time invariant system
that we can describe it in the

00:39:30.380 --> 00:39:34.560
frequency domain through the
convolution property, and we

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:38.940
can use the properties of
the Fourier transform.

00:39:38.940 --> 00:39:43.190
So let's take, as our example,
a first order differential

00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:46.670
equation as I indicate here.

00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:49.560
So the derivative of the output
plus a times the output

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:52.330
is equal to the input.

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:57.080
And now we can use the
differentiation property.

00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.250
If we Fourier transform this
entire expression, the

00:40:01.250 --> 00:40:06.690
differentiation property tells
us that the Fourier transform

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:10.290
of the derivative of the
output is the Fourier

00:40:10.290 --> 00:40:14.560
transform of the output
multiplied by j omega.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:20.330
And linearity will let us write
the Fourier transform of

00:40:20.330 --> 00:40:22.810
this as a times y of omega.

00:40:22.810 --> 00:40:25.690
And since these are added
together, and since we have

00:40:25.690 --> 00:40:29.330
the linearity property, these
are added together.

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:34.600
And x of omega is the Fourier
transform of x of t.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:40.630
So what we've used is the
differentiation property, and

00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:43.185
we've used the linearity
property.

00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:52.980
We can solve this equation
for y of omega.

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:57.420
The Fourier transform of the
output in terms of x of omega,

00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:01.970
the Fourier transform of the
input, and a simple algebraic

00:41:01.970 --> 00:41:05.430
step gets us to this
expression.

00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:08.550
So the Fourier transform of the
output is 1 over j omega

00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:12.110
plus a times the Fourier
transform of the input.

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:16.220
And I've just simply repeated
that equation up here.

00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:25.470
So far this is algebra, and the
question is, now, how do

00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:27.540
we interpret this?

00:41:27.540 --> 00:41:32.880
Well, we know that the Fourier
transform of the output is the

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:38.060
Fourier transform of the input
times the Fourier transform of

00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.120
the impulse response of
the system, namely

00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:41.830
the frequency response.

00:41:41.830 --> 00:41:47.170
So, in fact, if we think of
h of t and h of omega as a

00:41:47.170 --> 00:41:51.980
Fourier transform pair, it's the
convolution property that

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:58.295
lets us equate this term
with h of omega.

00:41:58.295 --> 00:42:02.230
So here we're using the
convolution property.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:10.750
So we know what the Fourier
transform of the impulse

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:14.030
response is, namely 1
over j omega plus a.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.870
We may have, for example, wanted
in our problem, instead

00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:23.420
of getting the frequency
response, to

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:25.790
get the impulse response.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:28.690
And there are a variety of
ways that we can do this.

00:42:28.690 --> 00:42:32.400
We can attempt to go through the
inverse Fourier transform

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:33.570
expression.

00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:38.780
But in fact, one of the most
useful ways is formally called

00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:40.490
the inspection method.

00:42:40.490 --> 00:42:46.190
Informally it's called, if you
worked it out going one way,

00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:48.630
then you ought to remember the
answer so that you know how to

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:51.000
get back method.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:56.140
So what that says is, remember
that we worked an example, and

00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.520
in fact I showed you the
example earlier in the

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.540
lecture, that the Fourier
transform of e to the minus at

00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.460
times the step is 1 over
j omega plus a?

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:11.550
So what is the inverse Fourier
transfer of 1 over

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:13.130
j omega plus a?

00:43:13.130 --> 00:43:19.890
Well, it's e to the minus
at times a unit step.

00:43:19.890 --> 00:43:22.840
And that's just simply
remembering, in essence, this

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.090
particular transform pair.

00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:32.070
I've drawn, graphically, the
magnitude of the Fourier

00:43:32.070 --> 00:43:35.890
transform here.

00:43:35.890 --> 00:43:41.100
And below it we have the
impulse response.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.610
The impulse response is, as I
just indicated, e to the minus

00:43:45.610 --> 00:43:48.450
at times u of t.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:53.400
Now let's go back up and look
at the magnitude of the

00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:56.240
frequency response.

00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.030
And given just the little bit
of discussion that we had

00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:05.680
previously about filtering, you
should be able to infer

00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:09.940
something about the filtering
characteristics of this

00:44:09.940 --> 00:44:13.680
simple, first order differential
equation.

00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:17.740
In particular, if you look at
that frequency response, the

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.550
frequency response falls off
with frequency and so what it

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:27.080
tends to do is attenuate high
frequencies and retain low

00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:28.160
frequencies.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:32.950
So in fact, you could think of
the defocusing that we did on

00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:35.640
the image of Fourier, you
could think of that,

00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:39.390
approximately, as similar to the
kind of filtering action

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:43.630
that you would get by passing a
signal through a first order

00:44:43.630 --> 00:44:44.880
differential equation.

00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:52.640
Just to illustrate one
additional step in both

00:44:52.640 --> 00:44:56.090
evaluating inverse transforms
and using Fourier transform

00:44:56.090 --> 00:44:59.690
properties to solve linear
constant coefficient

00:44:59.690 --> 00:45:04.250
differential equations, let's
take the same example and,

00:45:04.250 --> 00:45:07.830
rather than finding the impulse
response, let's find

00:45:07.830 --> 00:45:11.910
the response to another
exponential input.

00:45:11.910 --> 00:45:13.830
We could, of course,
do that using

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:14.950
the convolution integral.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:17.090
We've just gotten the impulse
response, and we could put

00:45:17.090 --> 00:45:20.710
that through the convolution
integral to get the response

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:21.930
to this input.

00:45:21.930 --> 00:45:25.160
But let's do it, instead,
by going back to the

00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.890
differential equation.

00:45:27.890 --> 00:45:32.330
And so here I'm taking a
differential equation.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:35.920
I'll choose, just to have
some numbers to work

00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.400
with, a equal to 2.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.690
And now I'll choose an
exponential on the right hand

00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:46.030
side, e to the minus
t times u of t.

00:45:46.030 --> 00:45:51.700
And again, we Fourier transform
the equation.

00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:55.510
And we can remember
this particular

00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:57.490
Fourier transform pair.

00:45:57.490 --> 00:46:00.690
It's just the one we worked
out previously, now with a

00:46:00.690 --> 00:46:01.650
equal to 1.

00:46:01.650 --> 00:46:05.430
Clearly we're getting a lot of
mileage out of that example.

00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:09.660
And now, if we want to determine
what the output y of

00:46:09.660 --> 00:46:14.920
t is, we can do that by solving
for y of omega and

00:46:14.920 --> 00:46:18.520
then generating the inverse
Fourier transform.

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.850
Let's solve this algebraically
for y of omega, and that gets

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:25.460
us to this expression.

00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.420
And this is not a Fourier
transform that we've worked

00:46:29.420 --> 00:46:30.830
out before.

00:46:30.830 --> 00:46:36.190
And this is the second part to
the inspection procedure.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:39.430
What we have is a Fourier
transform which is a product

00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:42.940
of two terms, each of which
we can recognize.

00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:48.660
And what we can consider doing
is expanding that out in a

00:46:48.660 --> 00:46:52.160
partial fraction expansion,
namely as a sum of terms.

00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:54.650
Because of the linearity
property associated with the

00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:59.040
Fourier transform, the inverse
transform is then the sum of

00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.030
the inverse transform of
each of those terms.

00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:08.020
So if we expand this out in a
partial fraction expansion,

00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:12.990
and you can just verify that if
you add these two together

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:15.440
you'll get back to
where we started.

00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:22.670
We now have the sum of two
terms, and if we now

00:47:22.670 --> 00:47:26.740
recognize, by inspection, the
inverse Fourier transform of

00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:32.520
this, we see that it's simply
minus e to the minus 2t times

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.720
the unit step.

00:47:33.720 --> 00:47:38.320
This one is plus e to the minus
t times the unit step.

00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.280
And so, in fact, it's the sum
of these two terms which are

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:47.970
the inverse transforms of the
individual terms in the

00:47:47.970 --> 00:48:02.820
partial fraction expansion that
then give us the output.

00:48:02.820 --> 00:48:08.170
So this is y of t, which
is the sum of these two

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:14.350
exponentials, and this is the
inverse Fourier transform of y

00:48:14.350 --> 00:48:16.690
of omega as we calculated
it previously.

00:48:21.110 --> 00:48:24.940
Hopefully you're beginning to
get some sense, now, of how

00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:29.190
powerful and also beautiful
the Fourier transform is.

00:48:29.190 --> 00:48:33.980
We've seen already a glimpse
of how it plays a role in

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:38.050
filtering, modulation, how its
properties help us with linear

00:48:38.050 --> 00:48:39.510
constant coefficient
differential

00:48:39.510 --> 00:48:42.456
equations, et cetera.

00:48:42.456 --> 00:48:48.520
What we will do, beginning
with the next lecture, is

00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:52.310
develop a similar set of tools
for the discrete time case.

00:48:52.310 --> 00:48:56.650
And there are some very strong
similarities to what we've

00:48:56.650 --> 00:48:58.850
done in continuous time, also
some very important

00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:00.190
differences.

00:49:00.190 --> 00:49:04.150
And then, after we have the
continuous time and discrete

00:49:04.150 --> 00:49:10.270
time Fourier transforms, we'll
then see how the concepts

00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:14.030
involved and the properties
involved lead to very

00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:18.690
important and powerful notions
of filtering, modulation,

00:49:18.690 --> 00:49:22.250
sampling, and other signal
processing ideas.

00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:23.500
Thank you.

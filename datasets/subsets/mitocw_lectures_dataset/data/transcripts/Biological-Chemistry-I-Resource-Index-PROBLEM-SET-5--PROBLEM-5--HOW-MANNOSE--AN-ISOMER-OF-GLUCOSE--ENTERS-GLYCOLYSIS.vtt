BOGDAN FEDELES: Hi,
I'm Dr. Bogdan Fedeles.

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:25.940
I'm a research associate
at MIT doing research

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.040
with Professor John Essigman.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.990
I love biochemistry,
and I'm going

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.200
to help you solve
some problems today.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.580
Let's work together through
question 5 or problem set 5.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.420
This is an excellent question
about sugar biochemistry.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.130
Specifically, we're
going to find out

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.370
how mannose an isomer
of glucose gets

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.640
to enter metabolism
by being converted

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.230
into fructose 6-phosphate.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.090
Now mannose is a
common sugar that's

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.200
found in polysaccharides
and glycoproteins.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.550
Here is the transformation that
converts mannose, shown here,

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.430
to mannose 6-phosphate
in first step.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.950
And then in the second step,
to fructose 6-phosphate.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.420
So our goal here will be
to figure out the mechanism

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.000
for these two transformations.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.210
Let's take a look at the
first transformation.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.710
We're converting mannose
to mannose 6-phosphate.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.210
Now, as you guys have
encountered in biochemistry,

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.690
adding a phosphate group is
a ubiquitous transformation

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.440
and it's catalyzed by
proteins called kinases.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.010
Now, kinases typically use
ATP, the energy currency

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.350
of the cell, as a
phosphate donor,

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.860
and transfer the
furthest most phosphate,

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.610
so-called gamma phosphate,
onto the substrate,

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.852
and leaving behind ADP.

00:01:50.852 --> 00:01:52.810
A similar transformation
will be happening here

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.430
in part one of
the problem, where

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.820
mannose is going to be
converted to mannose 6-phosphate

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.944
by a kinase.

00:02:00.944 --> 00:02:02.360
And the source of
the phosphate is

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.389
going to be ATP, which, in
the process, will yield ADP.

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:13.310
Now, in order for the kinase
to work, to react with ATP,

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.650
we also need magnesium.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.740
So a salt of magnesium
with ATP is actually

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.390
essential for this
reaction to work.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.960
Now, let's take a look
at the structure of ATP

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.180
to gain a little bit
more mechanistic insight.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:39.390
As you know, ATP, or
adenosine triphosphate,

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.270
has these three
phosphate groups attached

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.470
to a 5-carbon
sugar called ribose

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.470
and a base, adenine, which we're
not going to draw out here.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.460
Now, the phosphates
in ATP are typically

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:03.250
labeled alpha, the one closest
to the sugar, beta, and gamma.

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.980
Now, in order for
ATP to react, notice

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.740
these four negative
charges on the phosphates.

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.160
They need to be neutralized
in order for the molecule

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.360
to become reactive.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.720
So this is what
magnesium is doing.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.150
So at least early
on in the reaction,

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.230
magnesium is going to
neutralize two of these four

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.800
negative charges, while the
other two negative charges will

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.280
be neutralized by positively
charged amino acids

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.140
in the active site
of the kinase.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.020
Once all the charges
are neutralized,

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.630
then the phosphorus
at the gamma position

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.990
will become available to be
attacked by a nucleophile.

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:46.600
In our case, the 6
hydroxyl of mannose.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.410
So therefore, the reaction
proceeds as follows.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.930
A base in the active site
will activate our hydroxyl,

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:01.120
which then can attack the gamma
position of the phosphate.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.020
And then the phosphate gets
transferred to the mannose,

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.940
and it's going to
leave behind ADP.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.480
Now, notice during this
reaction, magnesium,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.770
which was coordinating two
of these negative charges,

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:18.649
will probably move to coordinate
these two charges or the newly

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:21.320
formed charge here in ADP.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.350
And that would also
help stabilize the ADP

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.930
into the active
site of the kinase.

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.630
This mechanistic insight
basically answers part

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.440
one of the problem.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.050
To talk about part
two of the problem,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.965
we need to remember something
fundamental about sugar

00:04:39.965 --> 00:04:43.920
biochemistry, namely that
5- and 6-carbon sugars

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.557
exist in equilibrium between a
linear form and cyclic forms.

00:04:49.557 --> 00:04:51.390
Now, sugars that you've
encountered already,

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.730
like glucose and
fructose, they are

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.940
in equilibrium between
linear and cyclic forms.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.340
So let's take a
look at them first.

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.010
This is glucose.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.860
As you know, it's
an aldehyde that

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.250
has hydroxyl group on
all the other carbons

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:10.800
in this stereochemistry.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.680
Now, this is a linear form of
glucose, and as an aldehyde,

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.720
it can react with
good nucleophiles,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.550
like these hydroxyls, to
form cyclic hemiacetals.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.960
If the reaction occurs with
a hydroxyl position four,

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.810
we're going to close a
five-membered ring hemiacetal,

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.350
which is shown here.

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.010
These kind of structures
are called furanoses.

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.760
So this is the glucofuranose.

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.520
Now if, instead, we
react with a 5-carbon,

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.270
then we're going to close
a six-membered ring, which

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:45.980
is called a pyranose.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.270
This is glucopyranose.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.940
Now, while the sugars
are in equilibrium

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.860
between the linear
and the cyclic forms,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.950
the cyclic forms tend
to be predominant.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:03.060
So in equilibrium, it will
be primarily 99% cyclic form

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.380
and only about 1% linear form.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.650
Nevertheless, the presence
of the linear form

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.010
allows the sugars to
undergo some interesting

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.930
transformations, one of which we
are exploring in this question.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.930
Similarly, here is fructose.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.970
Fructose has the carbonyl
at the 2 position.

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:23.560
It's a keto group, and
then hydroxyl groups

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.070
on all the other carbons.

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:32.110
And just like glucose, it
can form cyclic hemiacetals.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.500
So if the reaction happens
between the carbonyl

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.980
and the hydroxyl
at position 5, it's

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:40.880
going to close a
five-member ring shown here.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.330
This is too a furanose.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.060
This will be fructofuranose.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.260
If the reaction happens with
the hydroxyl at the position 6,

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.080
then we're going to be closing
a six-member ring shown here.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.800
This is fructopyranose.

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.040
Once again, just like for
glucose, the equilibrium,

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.510
it's strongly shifted
towards the cyclic forms.

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:07.490
Nevertheless, there is
enough of the linear form

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.310
to allow certain kind
of chemistry to happen.

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:16.310
Now, going back to solving
part two of our problem, that

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.800
is converting from
mannose 6-phosphate, which

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.570
is a sugar with a six-member
ring cyclic structure,

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.960
to fructose 6-phosphate,
a sugar with a five-member

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.478
ring cyclic structure.

00:07:31.306 --> 00:07:32.930
Keeping in mind what
we just discussed,

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.450
that sugars, they're
in equilibrium

00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:38.730
between these cyclic structures
and their linear structures,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:43.680
linear forms, one
good place to start

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.960
to figure out how this
transformation will happen

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:51.780
is to write the linear forms
of the two molecules here.

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.880
Now, for the
mannose 6-phosphate,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.910
we notice we have a hemiacetal
functionality at carbon

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:59.700
1, which is attached to
both the hydroxyl group

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.420
and another oxygen.
So this carbon

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:09.010
will form an aldehyde
in the linear form.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:12.503
So let's write the linear
form of mannose 6-phosphate.

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:25.700
All right, so
notice at carbon 1,

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.610
we're going to have an aldehyde.

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:36.289
And then all the other carbons,
we have a 6-carbon chain.

00:08:36.289 --> 00:08:38.400
Now, in terms of
mechanism, this is just

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:41.100
a reverse of the
hemiacetal formation,

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.740
and it's going to require
a base to deprotonate

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.430
the hydroxyl here in carbon 1.

00:08:47.430 --> 00:08:49.510
And then we're going
to need to reprotonate

00:08:49.510 --> 00:08:55.200
at the hydroxyl in position
5 to form this hydroxyl here.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.210
Now, something to
keep in mind, though,

00:08:57.210 --> 00:09:01.590
the way this enzyme
works is we don't really

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.770
know if the enzyme is catalyzing
this transformation as it's

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:07.980
written here, or the
enzyme is just binding

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:11.610
the linear form that will be
in equilibrium in solution

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:14.600
of mannose 6-phosphate.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.340
Similarly, for
fructose 6-phosphate,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:20.010
we can write its linear form.

00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:22.970
Notice, fructose 6-phosphate
has a carbon too,

00:09:22.970 --> 00:09:25.250
it's a hemiketal functionality.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:28.880
This carbon is attached to
both a hydroxyl and an oxygen.

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.950
So that will open
up to form a ketone.

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:49.190
All right, this is our fructose
6-phosphate in a linear form.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:53.220
And notice at 2 position,
we have the ketone.

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.370
Now, it would be a good
idea at this point to number

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.530
the carbons to see
what do we need

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:00.530
to do, going from
this linear form

00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.610
of mannose 6-phosphate to
this linear form of fructose

00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.170
6-phosphate.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:10.150
So here we have carbons
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:16.630
And we have carbons
6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:19.360
And if we contrast
the two structures,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:23.350
we notice that carbons
from 3 to 6 in both cases

00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:25.150
are, in fact, the same.

00:10:25.150 --> 00:10:27.070
And we even have
the hydroxyls in

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.480
the right stereochemical
orientation,

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.250
in the right stereochemistry.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:38.140
And all we need to do is
move the carbonyl group

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.310
from the 1 position
here in mannose

00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:45.850
6-phosphate to the 2 position
in the fructose 6-phosphate.

00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:49.180
So this transformation
can be accomplished

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:52.870
by an intermediate, which
you have seen already

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:56.740
in glycolysis, the intermediate
that allows to go from glucose

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.900
6-phosphate into fructose
6-phosphate, which

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.680
is a cis-enediol.

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:09.520
So it's essentially enolization
with the hydrogen on carbon 2.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.710
So if we were to
form the enol here,

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.980
which, as you know from
the carbonyl video,

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:23.850
so a base could deprotonate
and allow the electrons

00:11:23.850 --> 00:11:29.110
to move and form another
hydroxyl on the 1 position.

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:33.225
Because this is a
cis-enediol, the two hydroxyl

00:11:33.225 --> 00:11:36.990
are going to end up on the
same side of the double bond.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:53.020
Once again, let's
number our carbons.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.130
4, 3, 2, 1.

00:11:57.130 --> 00:11:59.876
And this is our cis-enediol.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:04.690
So we have two hydroxyls.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:07.180
They're both attached
to a double bond.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.520
And cis means they're both on
the same side of the molecule.

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:15.130
And this allows the
enzyme to basically

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:18.010
switch back and forth between
which one of these hydroxyl

00:12:18.010 --> 00:12:19.660
becomes the carbonyl.

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:23.150
If we go backwards, we have
the carbonyl at the 1 position.

00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:28.450
However, if we go forward,
we can move the carbonyl

00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:30.020
on the 2 position.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:35.870
So that's just the reverse
of the enolization reaction

00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:39.680
in which we will
deprotonate this hydroxyl

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.580
and reprotonate at carbon
1 to take us forward

00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.860
to generate the
2-keto group, which

00:12:48.860 --> 00:12:53.150
is fructose 6-phosphate
in the linear form.

00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:55.340
Now from here, in
the very last step,

00:12:55.340 --> 00:12:56.720
we just need to close the ring.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.930
So that's just a
hemiketal formation.

00:12:59.930 --> 00:13:03.850
We have a base deprotonated
hydroxyl at position 5.

00:13:03.850 --> 00:13:11.290
And this will attack the ketone
to form the hemiketal group

00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.020
that we see in
fructose 6-phosphate.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.022
So now this is basically
the curved arrow mechanism

00:13:18.022 --> 00:13:19.480
from going from
mannose 6-phosphate

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.830
to fructose 6-phosphate.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:23.770
Now, some key points
to notice here

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:28.840
is that this enolization
reaction where the base removes

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.870
this alpha hydrogen would
not have been possible

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:33.970
in the cyclic structures.

00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:40.570
If you look here, this
hydrogen, the PKA is about 30.

00:13:40.570 --> 00:13:44.020
Now, once we form the
linear structure here,

00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.730
the PKA of this hydrogen,
now it's about 18.

00:13:48.730 --> 00:13:51.620
So that's like 12 order
of magnitude more acidic,

00:13:51.620 --> 00:13:55.450
and that allows the reaction
to for this cis-enediol,

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:59.380
which allows the formation
of the fructose 6-phosphate.

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.270
So the take home message here
is that opening and closing

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.440
the ring of the sugars allows
a lot of interesting chemistry

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:07.950
to happen.

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:17.660
Part three of this question
asks us to comment on

00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.630
why, when going from
mannose to fructose,

00:14:20.630 --> 00:14:22.040
we have to go
through the mannose

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.750
6-phosphate intermediate.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:28.460
Now, this turns out to
be a very common motif

00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:31.640
in carbohydrate
chemistry, because adding

00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:36.950
a phosphate group is a way of
regulation of which product

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:38.660
is being formed.

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:42.200
Taking a closer look
at our transformation,

00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.830
we see that if we didn't have
the phosphate group at the 6

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:47.690
position, this hydroxyl
would be available

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.100
and could potentially
be involved

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.200
in forming cyclic forms.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:56.480
As we recall our discussion
on fructose, whenever

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.360
we have a 6-hydroxyl
available, the fructose

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.060
can form the fructopyranose
form in addition

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.010
to the fructofuranose form.

00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:07.060
So by blocking this
position with a phosphate,

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:10.340
we're limiting the reaction
to produce only one product,

00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.950
namely the fructofuranose.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:15.590
Additionally, adding a
phosphate group to a sugar

00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:18.260
imparts a negative
charge, and that

00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:20.870
allows the sugar to be
trapped inside the cell

00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:25.539
and allows metabolism to
occur much more efficiently.

00:15:25.539 --> 00:15:27.080
This is something
that you've already

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:30.890
encountered in glycolysis, where
glucose, in the first step,

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:34.510
is first converted to
glucose 6-phosphate.

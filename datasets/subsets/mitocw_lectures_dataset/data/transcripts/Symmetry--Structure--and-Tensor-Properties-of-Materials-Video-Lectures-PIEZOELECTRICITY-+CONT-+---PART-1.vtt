00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.580
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:24.700
The quiz on Thursday will
cover up through

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.470
piezoelectricity.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.800
You've had a set of notes in
your hands that cover just

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.400
about everything that I wanted
to say about piezoelectricity.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.140
There are other modulae that
one could talk about.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.700
But these follow quite directly
from the one or two

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.810
that we will do.

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.520
So we will not have anything to
say about elasticity until

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.470
the last lecture of the term,
which is a nice outcome

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.260
because you certainly don't
want to take a quiz on

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.790
forthright tensors.

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.069
You'll spend the entire hour
just writing out all these

00:01:04.069 --> 00:01:06.290
cumbersome equations.

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.470
All right.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.770
So the quiz will cover up
through piezoelectricity,

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.020
including a few of the
representation surfaces that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.290
we'll examine today.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.980
The thing that we'll
be looking at is--

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.370
I'm sorry.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:26.930
You have a question?

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:27.417
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:27.904
A question.

00:01:27.904 --> 00:01:30.826
Well, you said [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:30.826 --> 00:01:32.287
example.

00:01:32.287 --> 00:01:33.261
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry.

00:01:33.261 --> 00:01:34.722
Third-rank tensors.

00:01:34.722 --> 00:01:35.210
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.620
PROFESSOR: Also, we had just a
little bit of that going into

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.055
the second quiz.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:41.890
And we didn't really ask
anything about that on the

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.050
second quiz.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.040
So it'd be third-rank tensors.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.530
But you have to use second-rank
tensors to define

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.450
third-rank tensors.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.370
So it really will be not the
emphasis, but certainly you

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.860
should be familiar with the
early part of what we did with

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.125
second-rank tensors.

00:01:59.125 --> 00:01:59.560
All right.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.940
So today we'll look at some
representation surfaces to

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:10.490
your wonder and delight at how
incredibly anisotropic the

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.810
variation of these third-rank
properties are with direction.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.230
One of the things that I love to
do for problems when we get

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.422
to these different piezoelectric
effects is make

00:02:23.422 --> 00:02:27.550
up hypothetical devices
just for fun.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.080
So among those that I've
invented, the first one is a

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.550
earthquake sensing device
because it's well known that

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.310
California is going to split
in half, and half will fall

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.360
into the sea any day now.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.700
So if this is the San Andreas
fault, I have developed large,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.310
prismatic monoclinic crystals
that I embed into the San

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.270
Andreas fault at regular
intervals.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.960
The bottom of these crystals
is grounded.

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.220
There's an electrode
at the top.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.830
And if the San Andreas fault
starts to move, and there is

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.960
shear on these crystals,
there will be a charge

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.470
developed on the top.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.130
And I ask you to relate the
charge on the top in terms of

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.130
the piezoelectric modulae to
the shear along the San

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.990
Andreas fault.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.050
So there's a very clever little
device that clearly is

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:27.130
going to be lucrative because
these crystals will have to be

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.120
huge in size.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.330
And they'll cost more
even than silicon.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.120
Another device that I've
invented is used down at the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.710
Boston fish pier.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:47.130
This is a crystal on which
I hang a pan, and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.710
you put fish in it.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:51.500
That creates a tensile stress
in this direction.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.830
We measure the charge
on this face.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:56.390
And we put a little meter that
measures the charge that's

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:57.380
accumulated.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:00.220
So this is how the fishermen
can weigh their fish after

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.810
they haul them in
off the boat.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.290
So you see this is really
practical material we're

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.910
dealing with.

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.290
This has applications in
all realms of life.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.790
So today I'd like to show
you, also, another

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.350
problem that sets up.

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.630
And I pass this out just so you
can, again, have a look at

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.709
some of the questions that you
should be equipped to answer.

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:22.780
So here--

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.750
not fully expecting anybody to
do it, but you can see the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.380
sorts of problems
one might ask.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.910
Here is problem set number 16,
which asks you, should you be

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.830
so inclined, to think
about manipulations

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.660
of third-rank tensors.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:47.010
But then the second question is
an idea for a device which

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.080
the Center for Material Science
and Engineering is

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.410
considering employing
here in building 13.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.870
And you can read all
about that..

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.940
This is the famous soup cell.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.640
I think probably you will see
some sort of for fun modulus

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.780
for a particular device
on the quiz.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.080
I haven't made one up yet.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.750
But I think you'll have a look
at something like that.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:22.520
And when we do the longitudinal
piezoelectric

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.800
modulus for quartz, which we'll
do momentarily, this

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.630
will give you an idea of how to
set up these expressions.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.770
The problem, basically, is that
the direct piezoelectric

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:45.390
effect measures a polarization
in terms of all of the

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.580
elements of applied stress.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.510
So there is a modulus dijk times
all of the elements of

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.990
stress, sigma jk.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.400
So this, until you use the
condensation of subscripts,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:05.120
contains nine terms going
this way and three

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.440
equations going this way.

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:17.140
As we discussed earlier, since
only six of the nine elements

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:22.670
of stress are independent, you
can condense this down into a

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:29.060
3 by 6 array of terms.

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.300
The problem in doing that,
though, even though one has

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.120
only 18 different modulae to
work with, instead of 27--

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.610
that's a considerable economy
in notation, and an

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.740
elimination of a great
deal of redundancy--

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:51.380
the matrix form of this
relation-- and I emphasize

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.830
that it is a matrix, and it's
no longer a tensor--

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.110
the matrix form cannot
be transformed.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:01.030
Again, there are only
six terms in the

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:03.720
matrix elements of stress.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:07.250
And there are three equations,
again, one for each component

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.720
of polarization.

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:13.450
So instead of having 27,
one has only 18.

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:19.280
But if you are considering
changing the reference axes--

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.130
and that is one of the things
that it's interesting to do

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:25.350
for these various modulae
that one can define--

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:29.520
change the orientation of a
particular rod-shaped specimen

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.600
that you cut out of a crystal to
different crystallographic

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.190
orientations and then ask how
the scalar modulus changes as

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:40.280
you change the direction in
which you've sliced out the

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.370
wafer or the rod of material.

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:48.070
In order to do that, you want to
transform the piezoelectric

00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.450
tensor to a new set
of reference axes.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:56.840
And you cannot transform the
dij's because they are a

00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.480
matrix and not a tensor.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:03.580
And no law of transformation
is defined.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:08.110
So what you have to do in any
generic problem of this sort

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:12.380
is, for a particular single
crystal, look up the form of

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:19.710
the dij matrix that will have
the equalities between tensor

00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:24.060
elements written in and the 0's,
those modulae which are

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.770
identically 0, entered
into the array.

00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.620
And then you have to work your
way backwards to get to the

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:32.559
full tensor notation.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:38.929
So we'll see this when we
look at the modulae for

00:08:38.929 --> 00:08:41.850
symmetry three two.

00:08:41.850 --> 00:08:47.920
You'll have to write in the
exact matrix subscripts

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.360
without absorbing the equalities
in the notation.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.280
And then you'll have to expand
the matrix terms into full

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:58.020
three-subscript tensor terms.

00:08:58.020 --> 00:09:01.000
Then if you want to transform
the axes, which is to say you

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.680
want to cut out your specimen,
be it a plate or a rod, in a

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.550
different orientation, you have
to transform the full

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:14.250
three subscript tensor elements
to a new setting.

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.110
And then if you want to continue
to work in that

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.980
setting in the compact matrix
form, collapse it back down to

00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.740
matrix form, insert the
equalities, and then you're

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:24.780
back to where you
started from.

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:33.290
So this problem of seeing how
modulae that describe

00:09:33.290 --> 00:09:37.910
different phenomena vary with
crystal symmetry, you have to

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.280
go through this problem of
expanding the compact form and

00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:45.100
then collapsing back down when
you've got it as a function of

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:50.810
some orientational angle or in
terms of a coordinate system

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.060
that you want to work in.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.610
The problem is exactly the
same for elasticity.

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.210
And we'll look at some of
these modulae next term.

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:04.780
You've heard these names
before, I'm sure--

00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.670
Young's modulus, shear
modulus, and so on.

00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:11.290
We'll take a look on next
Tuesday, a week from today, at

00:10:11.290 --> 00:10:14.800
Young's modulus, which is one
of the more important ones.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.800
And probably are used to seeing
this in the form of

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.570
information for a
polycrystalline material,

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:24.740
which is essentially
isotropic.

00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.090
The modulus is much more
interesting for

00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:28.740
single crystal materials.

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.610
And then the surfaces that are
defined particularly for the

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:35.490
lower symmetries are absolutely
wild things with

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:39.070
lumps and wiggles and lobes
and things of that sort,

00:10:39.070 --> 00:10:42.790
nothing like the dumb old,
uninteresting ellipsoids that

00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:45.515
we encountered for second-rank
properties.

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:54.750
So let's, then, take a look at
how we had set up and defined

00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:58.240
the direct piezoelectric
effect.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.200
We set this up as a proper
tensor relation, saying that

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.720
P1 is equal to d1.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:12.170
V1 And then, you'll recall, we
have nine elements of strain--

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:20.690
sigma 11, sigma 12, sigma 13,
sigma 21, sigma 22, sigma 23,

00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:25.800
sigm a 31, sigma 32,
and sigma 33.

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.950
But the tensor is symmetric,
so we really only need to

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:32.760
enter into our relation six of
these nine terms explicitly.

00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.630
And what we did was to replace
the two subscripts on the

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:40.350
elements of strain, which,
again, you need if you want to

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.400
refer to those elements of
stress through a different

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.580
coordinate system.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.870
You have to know the elements
of stress in tensor form.

00:11:49.870 --> 00:11:58.280
But we convert it to six terms
by going and replacing the

00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:02.580
pairs of subscripts with a
single one, two, and three,

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:05.820
marching down the diagonal of
the tensor this way and then

00:12:05.820 --> 00:12:09.080
marching up the right-hand
side, calling two, three,

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.300
four, and calling one, three,
five, and finally ending up in

00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:15.430
this slot here.

00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:18.860
And we call that six.

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:22.570
So that was the notation we
used to get to a matrix

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:23.520
representation.

00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:26.560
But the place where all
this started is--

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:30.190
and I'll write just one line
of this to be merciful--

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:37.340
d 111 times sigma 11, so this
pair of subscripts goes with

00:12:37.340 --> 00:12:41.270
this pair, plus d 122.

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:43.870
I'm putting that one in next
because we're going to number

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:48.630
the terms for stress in this
order, one through six.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:13:02.230
Times sigma 22 plus d 133 times
sigma 33 plus d 123

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:23.130
times sigma 23 plus d 132 times
sigma 32 plus d113 times

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:31.340
sigma 23 plus d 132
times sigma 32.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:35.040
And finally we end up
in slot number six.

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:42.470
And we have a d 112 times
sigma 12 plus a d

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.780
121 times sigma 21.

00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:47.110
Look at that.

00:13:47.110 --> 00:13:50.280
There's an equation that covers
two whole blackboards.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.670
So if we now condense this down
to matrix form we would

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:05.840
say that P1 is d 11 times sigma
1 plus d 12 times sigma

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:11.320
2 times d 13 times
sigma 3 plus--

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.910
and now we have this messy
problem with the 2's--

00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:24.020
we have a d 14 times sigma
4 plus, again, a d 14

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.560
times a sigma --

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.890
2 3 is equal to 32, so
I can call this 4--

00:14:29.890 --> 00:14:36.580
and then these terms become 15
sigma 5 and, again, a 15 times

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:45.595
sigma 5 plus a 16 times sigma
6 plus d 16 times sigma 6.

00:14:49.850 --> 00:14:52.690
Now we have to make a choice.

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:57.190
Either we are going to have, in
a general matrix relation,

00:14:57.190 --> 00:15:06.220
that P sub i is equal to dij
times sigma j, if j is equal

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.740
to 1, 2, or 3.

00:15:08.740 --> 00:15:14.490
But it's equal to 2 dij
times sigma j if j is

00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:17.500
equal to 4, 5, or 6.

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.940
And that is something we like
to avoid, if possible.

00:15:20.940 --> 00:15:23.470
That's ugly.

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.070
That's ugly.

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:28.120
And it's going to be a hell of a
matrix if we have factors of

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.040
two in front of some of the
matrix elements but not in

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.090
terms of others.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.355
So this is something
we could do.

00:15:34.355 --> 00:15:35.700
Hey, it's our ballgame.

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:36.750
We make up the rules.

00:15:36.750 --> 00:15:39.790
But that's going to be an ugly
thing to have to deal with.

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:44.740
So instead, as we mentioned last
time, what we will do is

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:53.410
to lump together these terms and
define d 14 not as these

00:15:53.410 --> 00:15:57.360
individual tensor elements,
but define those matrix

00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:04.700
elements as the sum of
these two elements.

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.450
And then we saw before that--

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.470
we saw last time in our
earlier meeting--

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:14.140
that from the converse
piezoelectric effect, which

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:18.270
expresses strain in terms of
an applied field, where the

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.280
elements of strain
1, 23, and 32

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.300
appear in separate equations.

00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:29.380
And knowing that the same
array of piezoelectric

00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:32.700
coefficients amazingly describes
the converse

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:36.020
piezoelectric effect as well
as the direct piezoelectric

00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:42.920
effect, we know that
d 123 equals d 132.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.933
And that is from the
converse effect.

00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:59.335
So equivalent to saying this is
to define d 14 as twice d

00:16:59.335 --> 00:17:03.080
123 because these two
elements are equal.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.869
So we're eating the factor of
two here so that we can write

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:10.589
a nice matrix relation
that doesn't

00:17:10.589 --> 00:17:12.500
involve a factor of two.

00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:18.890
So making this combination of
terms for the shear stresses,

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:25.355
we would have simply d 14 sigma
4 plus d 15 times sigma

00:17:25.355 --> 00:17:30.580
5 plus d 16 times sigma 6.

00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:33.790
And we can say, in general, for
the other two equations,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:41.370
by analogy to this one, that P
sub i is dij times sigma j--

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:45.510
a nice, neat matrix relation
but one for which,

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:49.550
unfortunately, there's no law
of transformation for the

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:52.900
matrix modulae dij.

00:17:52.900 --> 00:17:55.270
If you want to change to another
coordinate system, we

00:17:55.270 --> 00:17:58.990
have to be prepared to resurrect
this full three

00:17:58.990 --> 00:18:02.030
subscript notation on the
piezoelectric modulae.

00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:09.620
OK.

00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:11.573
Comments or questions
at this point?

00:18:18.475 --> 00:18:18.970
All right.

00:18:18.970 --> 00:18:23.910
If not, let me remind you that
in the notes which I

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:30.570
distributed last time, there
are summarized all of the

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:36.020
constraints imposed on the
piezoelectric modulae for

00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:37.270
single crystals.

00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:47.100
And, again, these constraints,
these requirements that the

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:54.500
tensors remain invariant for the
change of axes produced by

00:18:54.500 --> 00:19:00.120
a symmetry element that the
crystal possesses, these

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.880
transformations show that no
third-rank tensor property can

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.510
exist in a crystal that
has inversion.

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:12.980
So the 11 [INAUDIBLE] group,
so-called, that possess

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.360
inversion have absolutely no
property and can be not

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.150
considered further for
third-rank properties.

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:26.730
And then one must consider all
of the 32 minus 11 21 point

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.400
groups that lack conversion
separately.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.890
There's no reason why they
should behave the same way.

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:36.320
Remember that for second-rank
tensor properties we pulled

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:41.480
the argument that inversion
imposes no restrictions or

00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.960
constraints whatsoever on
second-rank properties so,

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.250
therefore, two different
symmetries that differ only by

00:19:48.250 --> 00:19:51.010
the presence or absence of
an inversion center.

00:19:51.010 --> 00:19:54.460
That is to say, you
change 2 to 2 over

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:56.150
m if you add inversion.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:19:59.240
But the argument was inversion
requires nothing, so the

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.590
constraints or symmetry,
too, look exactly

00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:02.750
like those for symmetry.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.450
And here you've got to plod
through every single one of

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:09.860
the non-centrosymmetric point
groups separately.

00:20:09.860 --> 00:20:14.080
And they all have tensors that
have different forms.

00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:17.840
So what I'd like to do is look
at one specific one.

00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:24.750
And that is the matrix
for symmetry 32.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:28.510
And that is a point group that
you'll recall has a threefold

00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:33.665
axis and twofold axes at
intervals of 60 degrees.

00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:45.760
And in your list of the
qualities and absences, 32,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:51.570
where the 3 is parallel to the
axis x3, and the twofold axis

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:53.700
is parallel to x1.

00:20:53.700 --> 00:21:01.560
So we're defining this as x1,
this as x3, and x2 comes out

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.720
halfway between the two.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:10.130
So let me draw this looking down
along the threefold axis.

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:14.000
These are all twofold axes.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.960
And we'll take x1 in
this direction.

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.600
x2 pokes out in between
two twofold axes.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:26.510
And x3 comes straight up along
the threefold axis.

00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:32.050
With that coordinate system, the
form of the piezoelectric

00:21:32.050 --> 00:21:44.884
modulus matrix has this form-- d
11 minus d 11 0 d 14 0 0 0 0

00:21:44.884 --> 00:21:56.680
0 d 15 minus d 14 0 and
in the bottom row d 31

00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:04.780
d 31 d 33 0 0 0.

00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:11.080
So this matrix with the
equalities put in is obtained

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:15.720
by looking at the full
three-subscript tensor and

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:19.810
requiring that it look the same
before and after any of

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:26.790
the rotations involved by these
three distinct axes--

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:28.500
the threefold and the
pair of twofolds.

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:33.090
OK.

00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:37.530
Now, there are many different
scalar modulae that one could

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:42.220
define, some of them serious
and worth the consideration

00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:47.940
because of the application in
devices or other practical

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.740
situations.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:58.100
The modulus that I'd like to
examine is something called

00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:01.280
the longitudinal piezoelectric
effect.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:17.390
And let's emphasize, again, that
it is impossible to come

00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:22.250
up with one representation
surface that fits every need

00:23:22.250 --> 00:23:28.410
because, again, the direct
piezoelectric effect relates

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:36.170
the components of a vector
to a tensor, sigma ij.

00:23:36.170 --> 00:23:40.470
There are six independent
tensor elements.

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:46.110
So how can you describe how this
vector is going to change

00:23:46.110 --> 00:23:51.320
as you change orientation of
a crystal whose behavior is

00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:53.840
described by all of
these modulae?

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.250
But I would point out, however,
that there are only

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.160
two distinct--

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:00.073
oops, I'm sorry.

00:24:00.073 --> 00:24:01.890
This is d 14.

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:04.260
I don't know how I
made that d 15.

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:09.470
There are only, in
this array--

00:24:09.470 --> 00:24:10.730
and I slipped a notch.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:11.980
Excuse me.

00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.990
Last couple of days are such
that I am not able to even

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.420
read from my notes.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.190
So these bottom lines, my
apologies, are all 0.

00:24:25.190 --> 00:24:30.600
And there are two modulae,
d 11 and d 14.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.120
So there are two independent
numbers, but they appear as

00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.540
different matrix elements and,
therefore, different tensor

00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:42.040
elements, as well.

00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.610
And this should be
minus 2 d 14.

00:24:47.610 --> 00:24:47.970
I'm sorry.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:50.910
I slipped down a notch,
and I got some for 32

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:52.630
and some for 6.

00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:55.030
And I'm glad I found it at this
point, or I'd really be

00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:56.280
in deep trouble.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:24:59.270
OK.

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:04.160
So two numbers and that is, in
fact, the form of the matrix

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.460
for symmetry 32.

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:10.520
So the longitudinal
piezoelectric effect is one of

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.730
the representation surfaces
that gives you the way in

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:19.800
which the polarization will
change for one very, very

00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:22.850
specific type of stress.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:27.080
In particular, what we'll
do is set this up as

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.330
a coordinate system.

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:38.830
And we will look at a coordinate
system where this

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:41.790
is the reference axis, x1.

00:25:41.790 --> 00:25:45.470
We'll come down with a
compressive stress, sigma 11,

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.680
along that axis.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:53.750
And, therefore, we're applying
a uni-axial stress, which has

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:55.890
just one component of stress.

00:25:55.890 --> 00:25:57.470
So that's very specialized.

00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:59.160
In general, there would
be six different

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.500
components of stress.

00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:04.160
But we're looking at one
specific stimulus applied to

00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.600
this crystal plate.

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:09.960
In response to that sigma 11
there are charges induced on

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.210
all of these surfaces.

00:26:16.170 --> 00:26:20.210
And these charges, this charge
per unit area, is proportional

00:26:20.210 --> 00:26:26.840
to the component of polarization
P1, the component

00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.590
of polarization P2 along the
surface out of which x 2

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:35.610
comes, and the charge
per unit area or the

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:37.420
polarization along x3.

00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:38.880
So this would be P3.

00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.560
And this would be the
direction of x3.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.600
Now I deliberately tried to
show this sample as a thin

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:53.900
wafer, which has a much larger
surface area here than it does

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.950
on the other two surfaces--
a much smaller area there.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:27:01.350
Therefore, since polarization
is charge per unit area, if

00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:06.090
this area normal to x1 is a very
large area, there's a lot

00:27:06.090 --> 00:27:07.810
of charge accumulated there.

00:27:07.810 --> 00:27:09.330
It's going to be easy
to measure.

00:27:09.330 --> 00:27:14.620
If we make the wafer vanishingly
thin, then the

00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:18.340
charge per unit area is high,
but the total area is small.

00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:22.500
So there's going to be a
negligible accumulation of

00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:25.240
charge on these two
side surfaces.

00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.150
So the longitudinal
piezoelectric effect and the

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:33.710
longitudinal piezoelectric
electric modulus is an effect,

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:38.400
where we look at the component
of polarization, P1, in

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:42.050
response to an applied
stress, sigma 11.

00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:45.910
So it's that simple.

00:27:45.910 --> 00:27:48.070
Look at all the terms
we've thrown out.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:51.920
We've thrown out a whole bunch
of elements of stress, which

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.800
we could impose if
we wanted to.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:58.690
And we've thrown away two of
the three components of

00:27:58.690 --> 00:28:02.510
polarization by designing
a specialized sample.

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.580
So all that's left then is
that P1 equals sigma 11.

00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:13.430
And the relation between those
two parameters is the 111.

00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:17.920
So all this is going to hinge
on one single piezoelectric

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.940
electric modulus, d
111, and how that

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.335
changes with direction.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:32.830
So this is for one orientation
of a plate.

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:37.110
And I had not specified how the
orientation of this plate

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.600
is related to the
symmetry axes.

00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:40.850
So let's do that now.

00:28:45.290 --> 00:28:50.270
What I'm going to assume is
that this is a crystal.

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.280
It doesn't look like
it's hexagonal.

00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.130
But imagine that this is
a crystal of quartz.

00:28:55.130 --> 00:29:00.270
And we could look at an x1
that's in this direction.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:07.690
And imagine that we have cut
out of this crystal a wafer

00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:10.070
that has a normal along x1.

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:13.450
And then relative to this
coordinate system, if this is

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:20.120
x1, the modulus d 111 would
tell us what charges

00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.725
accumulated on these
two surfaces.

00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:29.960
But now, what we could do if
we wanted to know how this

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:35.030
modulus changed with direction
would be to cut out a plate, a

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:37.880
thin plate, in another
orientation,

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:43.300
where this is x1 prime.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:51.160
And this has changed relative to
the orientation of the cell

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.240
edges in the crystal.

00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.220
The crystal is fixed.

00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:56.060
We're just cutting a wafer out
in a different orientation.

00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:58.280
So this is x1 prime.

00:29:58.280 --> 00:30:03.360
We're going to, again, squeeze
it with a tensile

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.490
stress sigma 11 prime.

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:12.090
And we'll ask how the
polarization P1 prime is

00:30:12.090 --> 00:30:13.820
related to sigma 11 prime.

00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:19.460
And the answer is that P1 prime
will be a tensor element

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.440
d 11 prime times
sigma 11 prime.

00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:33.460
So what we are asking,
essentially, is how does d 11

00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:38.280
transform when we take the
direction of x1 in a different

00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.225
orientation and, thus, change
the value of d 11 prime?

00:30:43.225 --> 00:30:44.560
It's going to change all of the

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:46.590
piezoelectric matrix elements.

00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:50.800
But we're looking at an effect
in a sample that is

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:56.540
deliberately prepared such that
we will measure only the

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.780
surface charge given
by P1 prime.

00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.780
And, therefore, the way in which
the properties of this

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.040
plate change as we vary the way
in which we've sliced it

00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:09.570
out of the single crystal is
going to be simply the

00:31:09.570 --> 00:31:13.970
variation of d 11 prime
with direction.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:18.170
So this is the general nature
of what we will do when we

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:26.100
define any of the scalar
modulae related to the

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.350
piezoelectric modulus tensor.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:37.500
We can change our notation a
little bit in that we have a

00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:41.100
modulus which I'll define
as a scalar modules d.

00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:45.330
And that d is going
to be d 111 prime.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:53.620
And I know how to
evaluate that.

00:31:53.620 --> 00:32:00.990
d 111 priime will be C 1l, C1m,
C 1n, where these are

00:32:00.990 --> 00:32:06.220
direction cosines, times all
of the elements in the

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:12.330
original tensors, dlmn, in the
tensor referred to the

00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:13.810
original coordinate system.

00:32:13.810 --> 00:32:15.550
So even though this
looks simple--

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.500
it's just one modulus--

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.210
when we transform it, we've
got a product of three

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:25.460
direction cosines out in front
at every single one of the 27

00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:29.760
tensor elements in the
original tensor.

00:32:29.760 --> 00:32:32.350
So it's not as trivial
as it seems.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:35.750
So this is how this modulus
that relates compressive

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.630
stress to induced surface
charge will change with

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:39.620
orientation.

00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:42.930
But what are these direction
cosines?

00:32:42.930 --> 00:32:44.850
These are the direction
cosines--

00:32:44.850 --> 00:32:47.650
not the full direction
cosine matrix.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:52.590
These are the direction
cosines for x1 prime.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:54.530
OK?

00:32:54.530 --> 00:33:00.970
So we can get rid of this
two-subscript notation if it's

00:33:00.970 --> 00:33:13.190
understood that these are the
direction cosines of x1 and

00:33:13.190 --> 00:33:22.270
simply call these l l, l m, and
l n, just as we did for

00:33:22.270 --> 00:33:24.910
the direction cosines of a
vector because we're only

00:33:24.910 --> 00:33:27.990
concerned about the orientation
of one of the

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:30.790
axes, namely x1 prime.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:35.260
We don't care diddly-bop about
x2 prime or x3 prime because

00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.400
these don't enter into the
modulus that we have defined.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.940
And this will be times dlmn.

00:33:44.216 --> 00:33:44.960
OK.

00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.210
Is what we're doing clear?

00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:57.810
So we have defined this
particular effect in terms of

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:03.900
those of the 27 piezoelectric
modulae which are necessary to

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:05.350
describe it.

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:09.370
And then we've established how
they will change with a change

00:34:09.370 --> 00:34:12.929
of the direction of one
particular direction.

00:34:12.929 --> 00:34:15.119
And we don't care anything
about x2 or x3.

00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:18.040
All right.

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:23.690
Now we go through this process
of inserting for matrix

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:27.100
notation with the equalities
built in.

00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:35.679
The proper matrix notation in
the first term is d 11 in

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.070
matrix notation.

00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:42.030
That's this term up here in the
upper left-hand corner.

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:49.150
The second term, the term that
we've written as minus d 11,

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.139
that's not d 11 at all.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:55.560
This is, by definition, d 12.

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.400
And we need the true subscripts,
if we're going to

00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.140
transform this.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:04.775
So this really is not even a
matrix because the subscripts

00:35:04.775 --> 00:35:08.170
have lost meaning, and we're
just using them to identify

00:35:08.170 --> 00:35:09.950
equalities.

00:35:09.950 --> 00:35:11.340
Then comes a 0.

00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.880
And next comes something that
we've labeled d 14.

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:19.880
And the subscripts there
are correct.

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:23.580
That is, indeed, the fourth
term in the first row.

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:26.870
But we're going to want to
convert d 14 into a tensor

00:35:26.870 --> 00:35:28.050
element momentarily.

00:35:28.050 --> 00:35:32.010
Now let's get the rest of the
terms that are non-zero.

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:33.325
This is really d 25.

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:41.930
So the next term that is
non-zero is d 25, which just

00:35:41.930 --> 00:35:45.940
happens, because of symmetry,
to be equal to minus d 14.

00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:55.360
But this is the true matrix
subscripts, and this is the

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.930
true matrix subscript here.

00:35:57.930 --> 00:36:02.430
The next term over to the right
is the fifth and final

00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:03.720
non-zero term.

00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.535
This is minus 2 d 11.

00:36:09.970 --> 00:36:15.600
And this is really d 26.

00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:22.710
Those are the true
matrix elements.

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.960
So we put in the proper
matrix subscripts.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.440
And now the next, final, step in
the expansion is to convert

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:34.710
these terms into actual
tensor elements.

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:38.230
So this is d 111.

00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:40.540
And these are tensor subscripts,
so this is

00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:42.770
something we can transform.

00:36:42.770 --> 00:36:44.460
This is d 12.

00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:48.780
In tensor notation
this is d 122.

00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:51.764
And that's something that has
a law of transformation.

00:36:51.764 --> 00:37:05.060
d 14 is really d
123 plus d 132.

00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:07.360
We lumped two tensor
elements together

00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:11.020
to define this modulus.

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:14.750
Minus d 14 that appears in
the next to the last

00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:17.110
non-zero spot is d 25.

00:37:17.110 --> 00:37:27.370
d 25 is really d
231 plus d 213.

00:37:27.370 --> 00:37:40.415
Then, finally, d 26 is
d 121 plus d 112.

00:37:40.415 --> 00:37:42.690
AUDIENCE: Shouldn't
that be d221?

00:37:42.690 --> 00:37:43.070
PROFESSOR: Sorry.

00:37:43.070 --> 00:37:44.100
d 26, you're right.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:51.520
That's down in the second
row. d 221 and d 212.

00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.950
Now we've got something
we can transform.

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.983
The law for transformation
is l sub l, l

00:37:59.983 --> 00:38:02.190
sub m, l sub n, dlmn.

00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:11.370
So And these are the direction
cosines of x1.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:19.570
So this term will transform as
l 1, l 1, l1 times d 111 .

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:35.440
1 The next term will transform
as l 1, l 2, l 2 times d 122.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.020
And that will be d 122
prime for different

00:38:39.020 --> 00:38:40.560
orientation of x1.

00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:42.910
This will be two terms.

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:45.780
This will be l 123.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.250
And I can write them
in any order.

00:38:47.250 --> 00:38:54.020
So this is l 123 times
d 123 plus d 132.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:57.720
And these terms prime, when we
change axes, are going to be

00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:19.050
equal to l 2, l 1, l 3 times
d 231 plus d 213.

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:26.350
And this last term will be l
1, l 2 squared times d 221

00:39:26.350 --> 00:39:30.690
plus d 212.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:31.130
All right.

00:39:31.130 --> 00:39:34.530
So this now is our new tensor
element, d 11 prime.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:42.480
And that's given by
this sum of terms.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:49.860
So we'll have a first term
l 1 cubed times d 111.

00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.800
And if I look through these
other terms, that's the only

00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:56.300
term in l 1 cubed
that I'll have.

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:00.260
The next term will involve the
product of three cosines--

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:05.640
l 1 and l 2 squared
times d 122.

00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:10.420
And if I go down here, here's
an l 1, l 2 squared again.

00:40:10.420 --> 00:40:20.610
So I have plus d
221 plus d 212.

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.100
And then, finally, the other
coefficient that I have is

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:31.880
plus l 1, l 2, l 3--

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.730
which is what this should be.

00:40:33.730 --> 00:40:41.450
And that will be times the sum
of terms d 123 plus d 132.

00:40:41.450 --> 00:40:43.450
Up here, you've got the
same thing again--

00:40:43.450 --> 00:40:50.170
plus d 231 plus d 213.

00:40:50.170 --> 00:40:56.145
And I have a total of
1, 2, 3, 4, 5--

00:40:56.145 --> 00:40:58.820
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 terms.

00:41:02.150 --> 00:41:08.180
OK, that is how the longitudinal
piezoelectric

00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:12.950
modulus will change as we change
the direction of the

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:16.430
normal to the plate that we have
cut out of the crystal.

00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:20.170
So these are direction cosines
relative to the

00:41:20.170 --> 00:41:22.960
crystallographic axes.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:25.860
l 3 is the angle between the
normal to the plate and the

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.240
threefold axis.

00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.200
l 1 is the angle cosine to the
angle between the normal to

00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.270
the plate and one of
the twofold axes.

00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:38.680
And l 2 is the direction cosine
for the normal to the

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:41.930
threefold axis and
the twofold axis.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:42.240
OK.

00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:45.000
So we've got it now in terms
of tensor elements.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:45.800
And now--

00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:46.514
yeah?

00:41:46.514 --> 00:41:48.737
AUDIENCE: Is it at all
reasonable to assume instead

00:41:48.737 --> 00:41:53.430
of taking those sums in d 123,
d 122, just saying 2 d 123?

00:41:53.430 --> 00:41:57.244
Is that OK in assuming?

00:41:57.244 --> 00:41:58.048
Or not necessarily?

00:41:58.048 --> 00:42:00.500
PROFESSOR: Well, we
could do that.

00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:07.430
But I did it the long way to not
obscure what we're doing.

00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:08.620
OK?

00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:11.830
This is a well-defined summation
over subscripts.

00:42:11.830 --> 00:42:16.140
And we're going to collapse
immediately down to the sums.

00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:18.420
And we're going to replace
the equalities.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:22.110
So let's see what comes out
of this, if we now, having

00:42:22.110 --> 00:42:25.650
reached the zenith, having
transformed the tensor

00:42:25.650 --> 00:42:33.100
elements, go down and replace
this with a consolidation of

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:35.580
terms and an insertion
of the equalities

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.830
between the matrix elements.

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:47.820
OK The first term is d 11.

00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:53.620
So I will have l 1
cubed times d 11.

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:57.060
Notice I'm getting third powers
of direction cosines,

00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:00.530
which is going to be what causes
the exotic nature of

00:43:00.530 --> 00:43:02.990
these anisotropies.

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:08.070
And then I have a product
of l 1 and l 2 squared.

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:15.040
And this is d 12.

00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:25.800
And this second term is--

00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.760
where did it go?

00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:31.440
This is d 21 plus d 212.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:35.140
And that is what we call d 26.

00:43:42.550 --> 00:43:46.390
And then, finally, this product
of three different

00:43:46.390 --> 00:43:48.332
direction cosines--

00:43:48.332 --> 00:43:52.720
l 1, l 2, l 3.

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:58.360
And we have d 231 plus d 213.

00:43:58.360 --> 00:43:59.680
And this is d 25.

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.818
And, again, an l 1, l
2, l 3 times d 14.

00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:22.990
And the second term here is d
25, if I've done it correctly.

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:24.240
d 25 --

00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:29.080
this is d 24.

00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.870
And this one is d 24.

00:44:33.870 --> 00:44:40.800
2/4 OK.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:43.830
Let's now insert the
equalities--

00:44:43.830 --> 00:44:45.840
back to where we came from.

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:48.202
d 11 is d 11.

00:44:48.202 --> 00:44:51.820
d 12, however, for
symmetry 32--

00:44:58.551 --> 00:45:02.700
I'm going to my handy-dandy
chart of symmetry

00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.950
restrictions.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:09.850
I don't want to do that.

00:45:09.850 --> 00:45:12.037
That's fourth rank.

00:45:12.037 --> 00:45:13.170
AUDIENCE: It's still
on the board.

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:16.090
PROFESSOR: It's still
on the board?

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:16.880
Yes.

00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:17.710
Thank you.

00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:21.276
When your nose is in it,
it's hard to see.

00:45:21.276 --> 00:45:29.490
d 12 is minus d 11.

00:45:29.490 --> 00:45:33.750
1 And d 26 is minus 2 d 11.

00:45:38.890 --> 00:45:41.490
So these two terms can
be consolidated.

00:45:41.490 --> 00:45:53.380
l 1 cubed plus l 1, l 2 squared
times d 11 minus d 11.

00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.310
So these two terms die.

00:45:55.310 --> 00:46:00.670
And I have a minus 2
d 11 that's left.

00:46:00.670 --> 00:46:06.220
If I insert the equalities here,
I'll have l 1, l 2, l 3.

00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.840
d 25 is minus d 14.

00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.970
And here's a d 14 itself.

00:46:14.970 --> 00:46:17.550
So these two terms die.

00:46:17.550 --> 00:46:18.800
And then I had d 25.

00:46:21.290 --> 00:46:22.980
And that is--

00:46:22.980 --> 00:46:24.360
AUDIENCE: You don't have d25.

00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:25.120
PROFESSOR: I don't have d 25.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.903
Where did I get the extra one?

00:46:26.903 --> 00:46:28.153
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:30.607 --> 00:46:31.845
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:46:31.845 --> 00:46:34.980
I'll take your word for it.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.320
And I know how it
has to turn out.

00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:41.220
OK.

00:46:41.220 --> 00:46:43.340
So these two terms
kill each other.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:48.080
And I'm left with, then,
an l 1, l 2, l 3.

00:46:51.330 --> 00:46:54.190
Or have I left something out?

00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:55.440
This is d 1--

00:47:02.370 --> 00:47:08.870
this is d 15 and d
231 and d 23 --

00:47:11.710 --> 00:47:16.470
uh, this is d 2 --

00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:28.870
and the combination of
13 and 31 is d 25.

00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:30.730
Right?

00:47:30.730 --> 00:47:34.090
And if I look at my equalities,
this is l 1, l 2,

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:41.480
l 3 minus d 14 plus
d 14 plus d 25.

00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:45.055
And d 25 is minus d 14.

00:47:45.055 --> 00:47:47.970
AUDIENCE: Why would
you add this d25?

00:47:47.970 --> 00:47:49.210
PROFESSOR: Let me check
my notes and see

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:50.370
what I've got here.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:51.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:02.695 --> 00:48:03.681
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:48:03.681 --> 00:48:04.931
See what I --

00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.740
d 25 is minus d 14.

00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:13.750
And then I have just a d 14.

00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:17.010
I don't know --

00:48:17.010 --> 00:48:17.660
I see what I did.

00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:18.780
I put it in the wrong slot.

00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.880
This is d 14.

00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:25.150
And d 25 is the one
that's minus d 14.

00:48:25.150 --> 00:48:28.870
so this term dies, which
is nice because that

00:48:28.870 --> 00:48:30.500
cross term is messy.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:34.000
So what I'm left with, then, if
I check against my notes,

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:45.400
is d l 1 cubed plus l 1,
l 2 squared times d 11.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:48.710
And then I have minus
d 1 minus--

00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:50.390
this doesn't belong in here.

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:08.840
This wants to end up being l 1
cubed minus 3 l 1, l 2 squared

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.290
times d 11.

00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.310
The first term is l 1 cubed.

00:49:18.310 --> 00:49:18.960
That's correct.

00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.340
The second term is
l 1, l 2 squared.

00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:25.260
We've got a minus d 1
plus minus 2 d 11.

00:49:33.580 --> 00:49:38.960
So I have minus 3.

00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.000
It should be a minus.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:40.855
Yeah, that carries
down to a minus.

00:49:40.855 --> 00:49:44.224
So I have minus 3 l 1, l 2
squared all time d 11.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:47.480
OK.

00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:52.630
So what we have ended up with
is an expression for the

00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:56.700
longitudinal piezoelectric
modulus as a function of

00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.110
orientation.

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:02.960
The surprising thing is that l 3
does not appear here at all.

00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:07.900
It doesn't depend on the angle
between the normal to the

00:50:07.900 --> 00:50:12.210
plate and the threefold axis.

00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:15.510
It depends only on one modulus,
and that is a

00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:17.970
remarkable thing.

00:50:17.970 --> 00:50:23.540
This says that the shape of this
surface is independent,

00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:30.810
essentially, of the property,
any property that relates the

00:50:30.810 --> 00:50:40.360
one one prime to a uni-axial
stimulus, sigma 11.

00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:44.240
And you measure a vectory
component in the same

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:48.310
direction is always going to
have this universal surface.

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:52.770
And it involves just a geometric
term and then one

00:50:52.770 --> 00:50:57.600
modulus that changes the
magnitude of the longitudinal

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:01.500
piezoelectric modulus but does
not change the asymmetry.

00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:04.550
So let's see what this function
looks like as a

00:51:04.550 --> 00:51:05.480
function of direction.

00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:08.000
Maybe we better wait for that
until we come back because

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.850
that's going to take
a few minutes.

00:51:09.850 --> 00:51:12.040
So this is what we found.

00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:13.310
That is correct.

00:51:13.310 --> 00:51:16.780
And we have to now decide what
this looks like, which will

00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:17.750
take a few more minutes.

00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.330
But let's stop here rather
than run late.

00:51:23.160 --> 00:51:23.600
All right.

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:26.120
Let's take our 10-minute
break as usual.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:22.130
PROFESSOR: In this
session, we're

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.950
going to be looking at
carbohydrate biosynthesis.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.200
Please look at Storyboard 29.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.750
Looking at Panel A, the
next set of pathways

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.640
on which we're going
to focus concerns

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.770
carbohydrate biosynthesis.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.260
First, we're going to look at
the pathway by which glycogen

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.160
is made.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.070
As you know, glycogen is the
polymeric form of glucose

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.590
that's very readily available
for energy production.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680
The second pathway
is gluconeogenesis.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.770
The organs that utilize
glucose as their metabolic fuel

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.030
prefer to have glucose at a
concentration of about 100

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.820
milligrams per
deciliter in the blood.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.260
The challenge
comes from the fact

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.920
that we eat only sporadically,
and thus, levels of glucose

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.650
will go up and down
depending upon the time that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.510
has passed since our last meal.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:08.120
When glucose levels
drop, gluconeogenesis

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.160
is the pathway that's activated.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.590
It takes non-carbohydrate
precursors,

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.290
converts them to glucose,
and then secretes the glucose

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.180
into the blood,
ultimately to help

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.360
maintain a constant
glucose concentration.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.700
Looking at Panel
B, our first topic

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.450
is the synthesis of glycogen.
If you look back at my first two

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.160
lectures, I describe the
structure of glycogen,

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:30.939
which is also shown here.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:32.480
The piece of glycogen
that I've shown

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.510
consists of a linear chain of
glucose molecules connected

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.960
together through
the 1 and 4 carbons.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.510
Chemically, we call this
an alpha 1, 4 linkage.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.130
To the left of the
glycogen molecule

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.770
is the non-reducing
end and to the right

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.430
is the reducing end, which is
connected by a tyrosine residue

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.650
to a protein called glycogenin.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.830
Glycogenin is a variant of
the glycogen synthase enzyme

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.410
we'll talk about later.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:58.010
Glycogenin has the
property that it

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.560
can synthesize a
polymeric glucose

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.290
chain, such as the
one shown, to boot up

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.110
the synthesis of glycogen.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.660
In effect, glycogenin
forms a primer molecule

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.580
such as the one
shown that provides

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.300
a non-reducing end that can be
extended by its sister enzyme,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.920
glycogen synthase.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.050
While I've drawn
a linear glucose,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.300
I want you to keep
in mind, the branches

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.210
off of the six carbon of
the glucoses in the chain

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.410
are possible.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.300
As I mentioned earlier, glycogen
is designed for fast breakdown.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.670
Its glucose units will quickly
enter the pathway of glycolysis

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.030
and generate ATPs in
a manner of seconds.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.910
Let's now look at Panel
C. It's useful to review

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.450
the biochemical steps by
which glycogen is broken down

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.910
because the exact same
intermediates appear

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.700
in the reverse order in
the synthesis of glycogen.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.890
The key enzyme for
glycogen breakdown,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.520
or glycogenolysis, is
glycogen phosphorylase.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.790
Glycogen phosphorylase
progressively will nip off

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.470
the non-reducing end--

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.480
that is the left-most
sugar as shown--

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.510
producing oxonium
ion intermediate.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.520
And as we saw in
my first lecture,

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.820
glycogen phosphorylase
stereospecifically adds

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.890
inorganic phosphate
to the bottom face--

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.590
that is the alpha face
of the oxonium ion--

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.090
to give glucose 1-phosphate
with this stereochemistry shown.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.830
Once again, these
same intermediates

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.020
are going to appear in
the synthesis of glycogen.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.990
Now let's take a
look at the way that

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.500
glucose 1-phosphate interfaces
with the other biosynthetic

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.730
and catabolic pathways.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.090
Let's look at Panel
D. This metabolic map

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.340
shows glycogen in the
lower right-hand corner.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.780
We can see how glycogenolosis
results in glycogen breakdown

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.020
to glucose 1-phosphate, and
in the reverse direction,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.020
we can see how glucose
1-phosphate can be used to make

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.660
glycogen by way of two enzymes--

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:55.610
UDP Glucose Pyrophosphorylase,
UGP, and Glycogen Synthase, GS.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.950
Let's look a little
deeper at other pathways

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.920
with which glucose 1
phosphate interfaces.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.260
This schematic shows
that glucose 1-phosphate

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.270
can be converted to
glucose 6-phosphate

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.480
by phosphoglucomutase, PGM.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.970
In this case, the phosphate
is moved from the 1 carbon

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.270
to the 6 carbon of
the glucose moiety.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.339
The opposite
reaction also occurs.

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:18.800
That is, if you have
glucose 6-phosphate,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.790
phosphoglucomutase will convert
it to glucose 1-phosphate.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.150
Glucose 6-phosphate is an
intermediate in glycolysis,

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:28.520
gluconeogenesis-- which is
the next pathway we're going

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.300
to look at--

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.420
and another future pathway,
the pentose phosphate pathway.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.970
All of this shows us
that glucose 6-phosphate

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.450
is a crossroads and one of the
branches that leads from it

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.990
and it is by way of
glucose 1-phosphate.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.170
Let's imagine a scenario
in which we eat a meal.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.300
Glucose appears in
the blood as shown.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.980
It is taken into the cell.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.530
The enzymes hexokinase
or glucokinase

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:55.700
will phosphorylate the glucose
into glucose 6-phosphate.

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:57.980
If the glucose is not
needed for glycolysis

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.840
or the other pathways
that I mentioned,

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.780
phosphoglucomutase will
convert the glucose

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.880
6-phosphate to
glucose 1-phosphate,

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.400
and then in the pathway
of glycogen synthesis,

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.400
glucose 1-phosphate will be
polymerized into glycogen

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.290
for energy storage.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:15.290
At this point, let's turn
to Storyboard 30 and look

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.860
at Panel A. Now
let's take a look

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.560
at the detail pathway by
which glucose 1-phosphate is

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.940
converted to
glycogen. At the left

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.420
is the structure of
glucose 1-phosphate.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.650
The first enzyme involved is
UDP Glucose Pyrophosphorylase,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.120
or UGP.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.860
The second substrate
in this reaction

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.100
is UTP, uridine triphosphate.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.710
The UDP Glucose
Pyrophosphorylase

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.140
catalyzes attack
by the phosphate

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.140
on the 1 carbon of
glucose 1-phosphate

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.630
on the alpha phosphorus of UTP.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:52.100
The two products are
pyrophosphate and UDP glucose.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.890
The reaction is made
thermodynamically irreversible

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:58.910
by hydrolysis of pyrophosphate
by inorganic pyrophosphatase

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.770
into two molecules of
inorganic phosphate.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.880
The UDP glucose is the
substrate for the next enzyme

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.640
in the sequenced
glycogen synthase.

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.740
I'm going to divide
the glycogen synthase

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.030
reaction into two parts.

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.970
In the first, we see
cleavage of the bond

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.950
between the 1 carbon
of the glucose

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:18.770
and the beta
phosphate of the UDP.

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:22.880
This reaction liberates the UDP
and generates the oxonium ions

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:25.050
shown in the brackets.

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.940
Structurally, this oxonium
ion is the same intermediate

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.700
we saw in glycogen
breakdown, but here, we're

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.310
using it as a
biosynthetic reagent.

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:37.590
Let's look at Panel
B. In this panel,

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.740
we continue the glycogen
synthase reaction.

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.200
In Panel A, we generated
the oxonium ion

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.250
of glucose, which is shown here,
in Panel B in the lower left.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:50.280
Glycogen synthase activates
the hydroxyl group

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.550
on the 4 carbon of the
terminal sugar residue.

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.640
That is the sugar on
the non-reducing end.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.240
The oxygen on the non-reducing
sugar residue of glycogen

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.300
then attacks the bottom
face of the oxonium ion

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.480
to give rise to a glycogen
unit that has been extended

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:08.430
by one glucose residue.

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:11.010
I have put an asterisk
on the 6 carbon

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:13.680
of the glucose residue that's
been added to the growing

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.770
glycogen chain.

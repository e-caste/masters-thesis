00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.370
PHILIP GREENSPUN: There
is no pizza for me

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.037
because I'm going to
talk about Oshkosh.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.800
So what is it?

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.430
It's end of July every year
at a big, a physically big,

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.030
but otherwise not very
busy airport in Wisconsin.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.900
And about 10,000
airplanes come in.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.980
People camp out.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.450
People hang out, usually at
least 100,000 people a day.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.710
There's a Boeing.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.500
There's a C-17 cargo plane.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.960
A lot of experimental-- it's
founded by the Experimental

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.123
Aircraft Association.

00:00:50.123 --> 00:00:51.540
So there's a lot
of people who are

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.082
passionate about
home-building there.

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.810
You can see all the
airplanes parked.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.970
There's 12,000 camping
sites, 40,000 campers.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.490
There's 1,500
workshops and seminars

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:10.720
that you can take to learn.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.450
Or you can just walk around and
talk to people, and hang out.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.420
So I planned this trip
for me and my friend Ray.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.560
He's a helicopter
pilot from Ireland.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.530
And the idea was to
fly to Niagara Falls

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.540
and show him Niagara
Falls, and on the way

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.430
back go up to Mackinac Island.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.710
They saw automobiles about
120 years ago and they said,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.970
this is a terrible technology.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.370
It'll ruin everything.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:34.240
They banned cars.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.440
The only powered air--

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.670
the only powered vehicle you can
legally have on Mackinac Island

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.530
is an aircraft.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.910
They do have an airport.

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.080
Anyway, on the back, we were
going to go to Toronto as well.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.620
So we had to get all this stuff
ready for international flying.

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.620
I had it all
carefully planned out

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.710
where we were going to
have 540 pounds of stuff,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.280
which is right at the payload
of the airplane with full fuel.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.490
But then Oxana,
who was just here--

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.790
she's an aerobatic pilot at
East Coast Aero Club-- she

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.590
said she wanted to come too.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.620
So then we had to
add a fuel stop.

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.438
There's our merry
band of three people.

00:02:15.438 --> 00:02:17.480
There's a whole bunch of
camping gear in the back

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.490
that you can't quite see.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:23.960
Oshkosh becomes temporarily the
busiest airport in the world.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.940
And you might say,
well, how can that be?

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.110
O'Hare has more flights.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.250
But they are only--

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.530
Oshkosh is only open
about 10 hours a day

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.470
because they close
the airport at night.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.040
And they close it also for
a few hours every afternoon

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.620
for an airshow.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.920
This is somebody's iPad,
I think, a screen capture

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.680
of airplanes flying
in and around Oshkosh.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.810
And these are only the
ones with the newest

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.460
ADS-B out transponders.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.940
So it doesn't show, probably--

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.682
this is probably only 20%
of the total airplanes.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.030
You have special arrival rules.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.170
If you're not a
sissy, then you have

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.405
to fly in visually, circle
around until it's your turn.

00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:15.780
And then they'll tell you you
can't use the whole runway.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.363
You have to land on
one of these dots.

00:03:17.363 --> 00:03:20.540
They'll say, land
on the green dot.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.500
If you are a sissy, you file
IFR, get your IFR reservation

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.600
with this DOS grade
computer system,

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.110
confirm it with this DOS
grade computer system

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.070
that nobody else
wants to deal with,

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.590
and then you get the whole
runway, and you just land.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.090
All right.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.630
Here's a picture of the
multifunction display.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.040
No, actually, I guess this
was in FlightAware later.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.380
This shows that
we diverted a bit.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.170
From Bedford, we ended up going
up to Watertown, New York,

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.920
so we didn't--

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.965
we could have-- legally,
we're instrument rated

00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:48.590
and everything.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.550
We could have flown
through these rain showers.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.160
But it's always smarter just
to go around if you can.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.750
OK.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.340
So we flew over Niagara Falls.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.630
We landed.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.430
We had that whole
runway to ourself,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.920
about 10,000-foot runway.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.580
And it's actually
oriented east-west.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.730
So we actually just--

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.280
essentially, we could have
done the same heading basically

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.860
from Hanscom Field all the
way to the end of the runway

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.630
and where we turned off.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.230
You get there.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.215
And there's just--

00:04:16.215 --> 00:04:20.180
I don't know-- 30 P-51 Mustangs
right next to your tent.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.830
There are people building this
One Week Wonder, an RV kit,

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.060
where you get to pull rivets.

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.230
Oxana is actually here.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.890
And she can tell you
about her experience

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.380
helping to build that airplane.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.830
There you see your B1 bomber.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.990
I love the antiques.

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.320
Here's one from the late '20s,
a Lincoln-Page airplane that

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.600
has been recently
restored and flying.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.310
There's that replica autogyro,
a beautiful Cessna 170.

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.065
That's an old Piper
Comanche there on the right.

00:04:52.065 --> 00:04:53.940
There's not a whole lot
of helicopter action.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.880
There's a little bit.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.905
This is what's called a
Safari Helicopter Kit.

00:04:57.905 --> 00:04:59.280
That's how you
know that you have

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.870
real confidence in your
mechanical abilities

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.160
if you build and then
fly your own helicopter.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.180
Piper Cub.

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.390
This is a guy who stuck
a Pratt and Whitney--

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:10.560
I think it's a Pratt--

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:16.230
PT6 engine into a Polish Wilga,
a short field landing airplane.

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.360
He added fuel tanks.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.410
It's such a fuel
hog now that he had

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.770
to add extra fuel
capacity in the struts

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.730
and flies all around the west,
going camping with his family.

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.230
All right.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.725
And that's called a Travel Air.

00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:30.850
There are a bunch of these.

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:32.730
So these are airplanes
from the '20s.

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.310
People were just using
them for transportation,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.520
throwing a friend in the
back maybe and a tent

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.530
and going and camping
out at Oshkosh.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.470
So I think that's pretty cool.

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:49.140
There are only five of these
Piaggio seaplanes, P136s,

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:55.530
that still exist out of 63 that
were built from 1948 to 1961.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:58.050
I saw two of them parked next
to each other at Oshkosh.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.550
That's what makes it
a unique experience.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:06.270
Here's some kind of airplane
doing a simulated bombing run.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.390
Meanwhile, a family is
there in their personal DC-3

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.110
camping out.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.260
Here's our little plane and
the $99 tent from Costco.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:20.960
It seemed like a great
idea at the time.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.530
I think we have a slide on that.

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:23.030
OK.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.440
This kind of summarizes it.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.470
This is the unfortunate state
of general aviation now.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.690
So we have the
innovation showcase.

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:32.480
And right in front of it, a
Piper Seminole, which I think

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:37.640
was certified in the 1970s
and certainly a derivative

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.370
of things going back a
lot farther than that.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.980
There were some
interesting talks there,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.050
some heavy hitters.

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.110
This guy Pat Anderson is a
professor at Embry-Riddle.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.360
And he said actually
that we haven't really

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.340
seen anything in the
electric aircraft world

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.440
because in the
early days of jets,

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.205
they just took these piston
airframes and stuck a jet

00:06:57.205 --> 00:06:57.830
engine in them.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:59.600
And they didn't perform
that differently

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.130
from the piston fighters.

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:03.680
But then five years later,
they had the swept wings

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.710
and what we would recognize
as the modern fighter jet.

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:08.630
So it completely--
it was the jet

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.120
engine did completely
transform the aircraft,

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.380
but not immediately.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:14.200
So he said, you're
seeing some of this now,

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.430
where people take a
little two-seat trainer

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.740
and they remove
the piston engine

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:20.780
and put an electric
motor with the propeller.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.792
But that's not really--

00:07:22.792 --> 00:07:24.500
what we're really
going to see are things

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.792
that are much more like drones.

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:29.293
There is an Uber.

00:07:29.293 --> 00:07:31.460
There was a guy from Uber
that was very interesting.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:35.810
Uber has aeronautical
engineers working for them,

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.540
designing aircraft, and then
releasing the designs for free,

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:40.550
hoping that people
will make them.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.240
They're claiming that
they're going to--

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.250
I don't know.

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.380
They've got to pay somebody
off in the government

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:46.310
to make this happen.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.680
2023 they say they're going to
be operating in Los Angeles.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.630
Their idea is that
the world is going

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.190
to be so congested that
people will pay up happily

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:59.310
to hop over the congestion
in relatively short hops.

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:01.730
So Uber is putting a
lot of money into this.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:04.220
They have some partners
like Airbus, Pipistrel,

00:08:04.220 --> 00:08:06.140
the Slovenian company.

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:08.100
We'll see what happens.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.360
So some round-the-world
pilots were there.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.860
Actually, I don't know how many
you guys know this, but Matt

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:14.690
Guthmiller, who was an MIT--

00:08:14.690 --> 00:08:16.250
between freshman
and sophomore years

00:08:16.250 --> 00:08:18.350
became the youngest
person ever to fly around

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:21.560
the world in a
Beechcraft Bonanza.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.000
I mean, he was in a
Beechcraft Bonanza

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.800
and he was the youngest person
to fly around the world.

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:32.260
But there's also-- at
Oshkosh, we met this guy

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:39.470
Dick Rutan who flew around
the world non-stop unrefueled

00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:44.400
in a plane designed by
his brother Burt Rutan.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.360
What else is Burt Rutan famous
for besides designing aircraft?

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.650
Does anybody know?

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:50.870
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.650
PHILIP GREENSPUN: What?

00:08:52.650 --> 00:08:54.740
AUDIENCE: Wasn't he
on like a spacecraft?

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:56.490
PHILIP GREENSPUN:
Spacecraft, that's true.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.702
But yeah, spacecraft and
aircraft, but what else?

00:08:58.702 --> 00:09:00.670
AUDIENCE: Canard planes.

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:03.370
PHILIP GREENSPUN: Canard
planes, those are airplanes.

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.320
Climate change denial.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.430
Look it up.

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:10.600
He's got like a 100-page book
about the scientific fraud

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.550
of climate change.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:12.508
But anyway, Dick Rutan.

00:09:12.508 --> 00:09:16.150
And the other interesting thing
is before this nine-day flight,

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:20.020
he was engaged to be
married to Jeana Yeager

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:25.120
and supposedly what
I heard at Oshkosh

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.650
was that they have not spoken
since they landed in 1986.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:31.570
So in nine days, there
can be quite a change

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:33.940
in a relationship apparently.

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:37.178
We met this pilot Shaesta Waiz.

00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:39.220
I don't know if that's
the correct pronunciation.

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:41.410
She grew up in
California and learned

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:42.950
to fly relatively recently.

00:09:42.950 --> 00:09:45.310
And she also flew a
Bonanza all the way

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:48.390
around the world over 145 days.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.390
So that was interesting.

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.010
She actually said it gets a
little bit easier once you're

00:09:52.010 --> 00:09:54.010
out over the ocean from
a weather point of view.

00:09:54.010 --> 00:09:56.980
She said except for the
Intertropical Convergence

00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:58.990
of the Equator,
most weather is kind

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.970
of a phenomenon of
being over land.

00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.370
To me, the most impressive
round the world pilot,

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.550
though, was actually an
Italian guy that I met.

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.620
He was in a Cirrus SR22.

00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:11.700
And he just flies to
Oshkosh every year.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.370
He just loads up in Italy,
turns the key, and goes.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:18.040
Every year, flies over
the Atlantic, and then

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.140
flies back to Italy
when it's over.

00:10:20.140 --> 00:10:23.260
So I thought that is actually
the coolest thing, when

00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:24.862
it's not even an adventure.

00:10:24.862 --> 00:10:26.320
You're not going
to write about it.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.862
You're not going to
build a web page.

00:10:27.862 --> 00:10:30.490
You're not going to say
you're changing the world

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:31.990
or helping to achieve something.

00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:33.365
You're not going
to set a record.

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:35.530
You're just using your
airplane for transportation.

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.970
You want to get to Oshkosh.

00:10:36.970 --> 00:10:38.410
You have an airplane.

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:41.320
So why should the fact that
you're on a different continent

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.510
stop you from doing it?

00:10:43.510 --> 00:10:47.020
A lot of people have stopped
doing home projects, home

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:48.010
repairs.

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:51.730
So Oshkosh, they actually
have people that teach kids

00:10:51.730 --> 00:10:54.850
how to hammer, how to drill,
how to cut sheet metal.

00:10:54.850 --> 00:10:58.460
There's a lot of great
workshops there for kids.

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:02.670
We were over by the Pioneer
Airport and the Museum.

00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:05.600
Here is the museum.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.140
They have a replica
Wright Flyer, a whole area

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.770
devoted to the Rutan designs.

00:11:11.770 --> 00:11:13.718
I don't know how many--

00:11:13.718 --> 00:11:15.760
I don't know how many of
you know the MIT spinoff

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.870
Terrafugia.

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:20.170
I guess-- I think it was
12-- at least 12 years ago,

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:22.420
they said they were going
to build a flying car.

00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.320
So I took a picture of this
1949 Taylor Aerocar, which

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.560
is actually a
certificated flying car

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:36.600
and unfairly associated
with Terrafugia.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:41.010
So this guy is kind of
an inspiration, I think--

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.590
Paul Poberezny, the founder
of the Experimental Aircraft

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:44.760
Association.

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.790
He flew the most expensive and
highest-performance aircraft

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:48.930
of the day.

00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:53.520
He flew the P-51 Mustang,
the P-38 Lightning.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.480
And then he came
home and said, well,

00:11:55.480 --> 00:12:02.340
what's cool to do after flying a
12,000-pound-plus P-51 Mustang?

00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:05.790
Why not just go to the
basement, get some plywood,

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:09.872
nail it together, and build a
really crummy plywood airplane?

00:12:09.872 --> 00:12:10.830
And that's what he did.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.775
So it just shows the joy.

00:12:12.775 --> 00:12:14.775
You don't have to have a
high-performance, state

00:12:14.775 --> 00:12:16.157
of the art airplane.

00:12:16.157 --> 00:12:18.240
If you build it yourself
or you're goofing around,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.960
you can have fun.

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:19.500
And he did.

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:24.570
And he was a better
pilot than [INAUDIBLE],,

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:26.490
I'm sure, in his P-51.

00:12:26.490 --> 00:12:31.610
So that made me think maybe we
shouldn't be snobby about these

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:34.370
home-built airplanes, because
if it was good enough--

00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.770
Poberezny had fun with it.

00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:36.270
All right.

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:38.460
So here's some examples
of home-builts.

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.490
Up on the left there, there's
some kind of canard velocity.

00:12:42.490 --> 00:12:47.180
These folks spent 15 years
building this helicopter.

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:49.500
And they had about 40
hours of flight time on it.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:53.640
So to me, in a good
month at a flight school,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:58.070
a Robinson helicopter might
fly 90 hours or 100 hours

00:12:58.070 --> 00:12:58.800
in just a month.

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.390
So it's taken them 15 years
plus to get to where a flight

00:13:03.390 --> 00:13:05.580
school would get in a month.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.350
But that's kind
of not the point.

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.060
It's not about
efficiency apparently.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.525
That's Rotorway kit, I bet.

00:13:10.525 --> 00:13:12.900
And they modified it by sticking
in a little tiny turbine

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:13.640
engine.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.920
This is another modification.

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:18.240
This is an old Rutan design
that became the Berkut

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.740
with a big piston engine.

00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:23.620
This guy stuck a turbo
jet engine in it.

00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.470
Here's the company--
yeah, 42,000--

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:27.990
I think that doesn't include
the engine, which is under 50.

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:31.360
You can build your own
little single-seat jet.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:32.310
Cirrus was there.

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:37.510
Cirrus actually has been kind
of an industry-changing company.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:39.010
It didn't seem that
way at the time,

00:13:39.010 --> 00:13:40.990
because it's very
similar in performance

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:43.720
to Mooneys and
Pipers, and Cessnas.

00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.360
But they really have
revolutionized the way

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.030
that families buy airplanes now.

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:51.210
And they've got
over 7,000 of them.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.820
The parachute is, I
think, critical to getting

00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:57.760
modern people to
accept this design.

00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.920
And also the glass cockpit
does make life easier.

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:01.930
Although, everybody else
has caught up there.

00:14:01.930 --> 00:14:03.250
Here's the Icon A5.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.750
They have the same
booth every year.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:05.955
A huge amount of excitement.

00:14:05.955 --> 00:14:06.580
People love it.

00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.050
A lot of people have ordered it.

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:10.480
They haven't figured
out how to build it.

00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:12.730
The price has gone
up to the point where

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.970
you can almost by a Cessna
Caravan on floats with a jet

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:18.600
engine for the same price.

00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.310
Here is a retired Air Force
and Southwest Airlines

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:24.170
pilot with his electric
self-launching Pipistrel

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.680
glider.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.530
Pipistrel is the
company to watch.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.570
They do a lot of
interesting stuff

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:32.998
in Slovenia, especially
with electrics.

00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:34.540
This is not the kind
of radar picture

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:39.040
you want to see when
you're in a $99 tent.

00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:44.110
I will say to Costco that it
did hold up remarkably well.

00:14:44.110 --> 00:14:46.280
But it was scary.

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.940
The seaplane base a few
miles away from Oshkosh.

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:51.670
They have the Oshkosh
seaplane base.

00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:54.428
I think it's on Lake Winnebago.

00:14:54.428 --> 00:14:56.470
So you take a shuttle bus
or you drive over there

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:59.860
if you have a rental car.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.230
So you'll see-- they call it
the quiet part of Oshkosh.

00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:06.290
It's quiet because you only hear
about three or four aircraft

00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:08.810
engines running at any
one time and maybe two

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:10.790
takeoffs or landings.

00:15:10.790 --> 00:15:13.130
They have four hangars, vendors.

00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.880
If you want to take your dog
in an unpressurized airplane up

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.090
to 18,000 feet, you
can buy this kit.

00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:24.220
I don't know what our golden
retriever would say about that.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.460
There's affinity groups
for different slices.

00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.300
Here's a woman who just
like-- just for female pilots

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.260
to Mooneys.

00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:35.510
Air shows every day.

00:15:35.510 --> 00:15:38.480
My favorite acts actually were--

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.620
I did like the GameBird.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:40.380
That was cool.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.350
But I also liked
these first two were

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.480
kind of regular
family airplanes just

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:45.950
being pushed to their limits.

00:15:45.950 --> 00:15:48.727
It wouldn't be legal just to
go out and do that in a Baron,

00:15:48.727 --> 00:15:50.060
because you can't do acrobatics.

00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.045
But he'll put it into
experimental category,

00:15:53.045 --> 00:15:54.920
and then just fly it
right up to the G limits

00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:56.600
for which it was designed.

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.630
And it's amazing to see
what these ordinary family

00:15:59.630 --> 00:16:03.020
or business airplanes
can do when pushed.

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.750
There were-- one thing
that's interesting,

00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:08.942
about 150 Beechcraft
aerobatic Bonanzas were built.

00:16:08.942 --> 00:16:09.900
They were strengthened.

00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:15.030
And it is legal to do aerobatics
in your four-seat Bonanza.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.920
Night airshow.

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.660
I guess that's worth showing.

00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:21.360
It is so unusual.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:24.720
They had explosives and
fireworks mounted on aircraft.

00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:28.370
They fly around at night,
shooting fireworks off.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.770
I guess you may have to
view that on your own,

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.940
which isn't so bad.

00:16:33.940 --> 00:16:36.160
A lot of warbirds.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.470
Everything from
World War II is still

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:39.760
flying pretty much at Oshkosh.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.988
That Grumman Tigercat
on the right,

00:16:43.988 --> 00:16:45.530
I'd never even heard
of that airplane

00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.613
until I saw it at Oshkosh.

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.490
That's-- I think this
is EAA's own B-17,

00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:54.890
which they fly around and
sell rides in and stuff.

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:59.840
Oh, and up on the top right
is a flying 1/3 Scale B-17

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:06.520
that some crazy guy spent
15 years building or more.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.244
That's EAA.

00:17:07.244 --> 00:17:09.619
Also, they have a B-29.

00:17:09.619 --> 00:17:12.547
Up there at the top right is my
friend Eric with his personal--

00:17:12.547 --> 00:17:14.839
I guess he's in the foundation
with a few other people,

00:17:14.839 --> 00:17:17.960
but essentially a personal DC-3.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.550
Oh, and he's flying
that to Europe

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:23.826
this year for the 50th
Anniversary of D-day.

00:17:23.826 --> 00:17:25.810
Is it the 50th?

00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:27.330
No, it can't be.

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:28.190
AUDIENCE: 75th.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:28.569
PHILIP GREENSPUN: What?

00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:29.310
75th.

00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:30.130
Sorry.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:30.640
Thank you.

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.670
I was a math undergrad.

00:17:33.670 --> 00:17:36.587
Good illustration of the
value of a Course 18 degree.

00:17:36.587 --> 00:17:38.170
And actually, when
I was an undergrad,

00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:39.587
people said, how
will you ever get

00:17:39.587 --> 00:17:41.170
a job if you're a math major?

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:42.540
The engineers all said that.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.810
Well, we said, well, we
can become actuaries.

00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:47.390
We can become actuaries.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:52.030
There was a group of folks who
were passionate about warbirds

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:53.380
down in the south.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.900
And they called
their organization

00:17:55.900 --> 00:17:58.098
the Confederate Air Force.

00:17:58.098 --> 00:17:59.640
Well, they've had
to change that now.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.980
Now they're the
Commemorative Air Force.

00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:03.550
And they're big into--

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:05.320
they brought the
Tuskegee Airmen,

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:09.010
some of the remaining P-51
guys from World War II there.

00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.860
I gave a talk with NOAA.

00:18:11.860 --> 00:18:15.130
That's Kate from NOAA trying to
get volunteer pilots to fly sea

00:18:15.130 --> 00:18:18.250
turtles back from Cape Cod
and other northern places

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.333
to Florida.

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:21.875
Sunday morning, it
was time to leave.

00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.820
For me, I saw 30% of
what we'd hoped to see

00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:31.190
and 1% of what there was to see.

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.093
As you can see from the
right, that One Week Wonder's

00:18:34.093 --> 00:18:34.760
coming together.

00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.800
It actually did fly,
I believe, on Sunday.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:40.270
So they got it built
in seven or eight days.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:43.390
We went to Mackinac
Island, beautiful place up

00:18:43.390 --> 00:18:46.340
near the Canadian border.

00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:48.050
Everything's horse-drawn
or a bicycle.

00:18:52.433 --> 00:18:53.850
A fun place to go
in the airplane.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.010
We went and landed in
the Toronto City Island

00:18:56.010 --> 00:18:58.890
Airport, which is right
in front of the downtown.

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:02.910
We had Chinese food,
saw the aquarium,

00:19:02.910 --> 00:19:04.110
landed back in Bedford.

00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:07.800
So we burned off 15
hours of Hobbs time.

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.340
Split by three people, that
wouldn't be too horrible.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:12.720
It was about $3,000 at retail.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.710
Next year, I think it might
be time to go JetBlue.

00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:22.260
So the summary is that
even as the regulation

00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:26.850
has made light aircraft
almost as expensive to operate

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:31.590
commercially at least or for
charter as the big aircraft,

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:33.450
but Oshkosh keeps
growing every year.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:34.950
More people are
passionate about it.

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.110
So what you're seeing
in the aircraft world

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.070
is like the very high
end and the very low end

00:19:39.070 --> 00:19:42.050
are kind of prospering.

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.482
This is Oxana's thing.

00:19:43.482 --> 00:19:45.690
She asked everybody like,
what brings you to Oshkosh?

00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:47.860
And they always
said, the people,

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.620
I love talking to
the people here.

00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:51.690
And I feel that way, too.

00:19:51.690 --> 00:19:54.230
People go year after year.

00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:56.670
There's a whole bunch of links
here in the presentation.

00:19:56.670 --> 00:19:59.340
And finally, what I
like most about it is--

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:03.210
and the reason I'm going back,
I think, is it's my safe space.

00:20:03.210 --> 00:20:05.050
Outside of this room
if I tell people

00:20:05.050 --> 00:20:07.260
I like to go over
to Hanscom Field

00:20:07.260 --> 00:20:10.950
and fly this little four-seat
airplane with a piston engine,

00:20:10.950 --> 00:20:11.730
they're horrified.

00:20:11.730 --> 00:20:13.660
They think that
that's just so dumb.

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.140
You could just drive in
New York in your Honda.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.105
You could get a ticket
on JetBlue for no money.

00:20:18.105 --> 00:20:19.230
Like why would you do that?

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:20.190
It's dumb.

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:24.710
But Oshkosh is the one place
where nobody will say that.

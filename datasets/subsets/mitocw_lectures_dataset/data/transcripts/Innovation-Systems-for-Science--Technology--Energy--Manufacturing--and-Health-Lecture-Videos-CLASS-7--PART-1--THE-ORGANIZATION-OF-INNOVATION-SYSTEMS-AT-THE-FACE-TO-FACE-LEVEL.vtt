WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So this
is the great groups class.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.310
Let me do a quick
background here to get us up

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.310
to where we are at the moment.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:36.650
And then, I'll just do a quick
overview of the William Rosen

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.020
book on the
Industrial Revolution.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.150
And I'll do just a summary the
Bennis and Biederman rules.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.310
And then it's your class.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.840
So, quick background, you
remember these characters Solo,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.430
Robert Solo, and Paul Romer,
and we'll just do a quick recap.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.080
But Solo, essentially, taught us
that technological and related

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.640
innovation is the dominant
causative factor of growth.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.240
Romer taught us that
behind that, in effect,

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.360
R&D system is what he
calls human capital engaged

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.880
in research.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.040
In other words, it's the talent
base that's in that system,

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.250
that these are to direct
innovation factors.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.810
And then, there's a whole
set in this complex ecosystem

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:26.600
of innovation.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.580
There's a whole set of
direct and indirect factors.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.750
So, Solo and Romer,
we just talked about,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.145
then innovation occurs in
a complex kind of ecosystem

00:01:39.145 --> 00:01:40.020
of different factors.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.030
Some are direct, like talent and
R&D. Some are much less direct.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.890
Some are set by
the private sector.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.270
Some are set by government.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.110
And you can see
here that rich list

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.120
of kind of factors
that aren't as central,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.330
that aren't as critical, but
still must be accounted for.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.430
In looking at that system, they
do play within that innovation

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.930
system.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.897
And then, a third
question, which

00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:07.730
has been at the heart
of a lot of what we've

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.330
been talking about in class, is
there a third direct innovation

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.020
factor?

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.110
And arguably, the organization
of science and technology

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.900
is that factor.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.800
So, we talked about how the
US innovation system evolved

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.190
and kind of told the
story of its evolution

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.100
in that World War II time table.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.290
The Rad Lab at MIT was an
important foundational moment.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.430
Vannevar Bush was the author
of that kind of leading tract

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.530
on what the US
post-war innovation

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.450
system was going to look like.

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.390
And his model led
to the creation in--

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.640
and the continuation, really
starting in World War II,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.580
it started in World War II, of
the federally funded research

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:55.300
university, and then the
plethora of basic science

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.950
research agencies in the US.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.900
So, that's innovation on
the institutional level.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.400
But, as we've talked about
before people innovate, not

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.010
institutions, which is really
the topic of today's class.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.560
And we're going to run through
a series of great innovation

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.060
groups.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.950
We'll run through five of them.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:25.510
So, we'll lay out Edison
and Bardeen, Oppenheimer,

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.900
the Xerox PARC group, Boyer
and Swanson, and Craig Venter.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.250
So, we'll do a group of
three that sort of came out

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.520
of the earlier physical
sciences side into the IT side,

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:43.900
and then we'll do two life
science leaders and groups.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.250
Just as background,
William Rosen

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.680
wrote this book called
The Industrial Revolution

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.600
in Britain, and he has
important lessons for us

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.830
on the process of innovation,
and I'll just recap.

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:02.890
I'll just pull out of that book
some thoughts that may help us

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.850
think a little bit in the
big picture kind of way

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.170
about some of these issues.

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.500
First, he identifies something
called the intelligent hand.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.420
And that concept is
taken from Charles Bell,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:21.300
but it really originates
in Immanuel Kant

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.750
who identified the hand
as a window in the world.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.850
And since MIT's model is mind
and hand, in other words,

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.780
in many ways, it's
learning by doing,

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.360
that's an important
conceptual framework

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.690
when we begin to think about
innovation that's clearly not

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.710
mind only.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.480
It is clearly mind and hand.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.010
It's the combination
of the ability

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.290
to do things physically
and in a tactile way,

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:48.477
carry them out as well as
think those great conceptual

00:04:48.477 --> 00:04:49.310
organizing thoughts.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.350
Davinci combines,
and I've just been

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.360
reading a biography
of him, but he

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.050
amazingly in his thousands
of pages of notebooks

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:09.760
combines his incredible
ability to do art and draw

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.920
with his highly inventive
skill set of imagining

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.110
all kinds of new
machines, right,

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.810
that were unimagined in
the context of the 1500's

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:22.010
when he's writing.

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:23.285
Helicopters, as one example.

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:32.250
His ability to see and
conceptually see and draw

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.720
helps enable him to invent
these big conceptual ideas.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:40.550
So that's another way of
looking at mind and hand.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.160
Right.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.710
Another way of looking
at the intelligent hand.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.280
So Rosen argues that the
visual, and the tactile,

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.000
and the mind, and the
eye, and the hand,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:58.320
are all critical in this
innovation invention process.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:04.500
Just to quote-- to take a few
moments here and pull moments

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.510
out of his book,
one is what he calls

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:07.830
the flash of insight problem.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:12.060
And the example he
provides is James Watt

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.080
is walking on the
green of Glasgow.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.980
And in that moment,
and, of course,

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.620
it's Scotland, so he's
walking past the golf shack.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.120
Right.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:24.870
Where else?

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:25.820
Right.

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.200
He has the idea for
condensation in achieving

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.150
a much higher level of
efficiency of steam power.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:37.580
So, there are steam engines
working in mines prior to Watt,

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.850
but it's that walk on
the green where he writes

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.980
that the inside came together.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.740
But, we have to put
this into the context.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.890
His insight, as he's walking
next to the golf shack,

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.130
appears effortless,
but it's built

00:06:57.130 --> 00:07:02.710
on a long term project
of understanding

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:04.660
how steam power worked.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.420
And Watt is an
interesting figure

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.320
because he comes out of a
poor background in Scotland.

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.990
He gets-- he's a
skilled artisan.

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.420
He becomes an instrument maker.

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.330
So, he's working on early
scientific, and navigational,

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:24.290
and astronomy instruments.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:27.170
And he works in London,
and he's exposed

00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.110
to the finest skilled
artisans working

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:31.910
on those early
scientific instruments.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.670
He comes back to Glasgow.

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:38.450
He's blocked by the local
Guild from setting up

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:41.533
his own instrument shop.

00:07:41.533 --> 00:07:42.450
What's he going to do?

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:45.290
He takes a job at the
University of Edinburgh

00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.430
and actually becomes
quite a close friend

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:51.980
of Adam Smith who's inventing
economics at the same time.

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:57.730
And he digs into, in
depth, into steam engines,

00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.300
and begins to develop
concepts of how they actually

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.260
function and work.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.050
I mean, this is
pre-thermodynamics.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.680
But Watt is developing a
lot of those early idea

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.080
concepts that will lead to that
conceptual kind of framework.

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.710
And he spends 10
years on that project

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.740
before he has the
walk on the green.

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.380
Right.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.100
Doing these various projects.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:28.850
So it's that 10 years
that enables the insight.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:32.900
So, Anders Ericsson who
Rosen also writes about

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.700
develops the expert
performance model.

00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.700
Its time on task.

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:40.049
It's not talent alone.

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.049
So, it's really important
to do those 10,000

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:46.350
hours of practicing
before you can pretend

00:08:46.350 --> 00:08:48.550
to be a serious musician.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.790
Right.

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.250
So, you may appear
musically fluent,

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:55.910
but those 10,000
hours of practice

00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:58.990
turn out to be absolutely
critical foundations.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.210
So, it's this combination
of expert performance,

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:06.670
Anders Ericsson
Ericsson would argue,

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:08.920
with that intellectual
capability

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.050
that's very key here.

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:14.710
Michael Polanyi, a
philosopher and psychologist

00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:17.290
thinks about learning by doing.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.700
What does that
process look like?

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:24.250
And he develops a whole
concept of tactile knowing,

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:28.270
that it's a combination
of knowledge and skills,

00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.360
actual physical tactile
kinds of skills.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:36.880
Eric Kandel begins the work
in neuroscience and beginning

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.420
to tell us how
learning can occur.

00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:53.050
And he's there great Columbia
neuroscientist Nobel winner.

00:09:53.050 --> 00:09:59.460
He tells us how
the brain chemistry

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:05.040
changes in the course of
actual tactile experience.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:06.900
Right.

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:10.250
Which helps us
understand why that--

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:14.900
its mind and hand
in combination.

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.300
So, let me let me
leave those there.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.840
And then, turn to Warren
Bennis and Patricia Ward

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.950
Biederman who wrote this book
called Organizing Genius back

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:28.070
in 1997.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:32.920
So Bennis had been an
MIT faculty member.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:35.470
He became president of
a university in Ohio.

00:10:35.470 --> 00:10:37.840
He then moved to
teach business at USC,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.630
which is where he's writing this
book from along with Patricia

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.340
Biderman from USC.

00:10:46.940 --> 00:10:50.420
And they, after watching closely
a lot of innovation groups,

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:54.570
as you all saw, they
develop the idea

00:10:54.570 --> 00:11:00.390
that these groups seem to
operate on rule systems.

00:11:00.390 --> 00:11:03.810
That there are kind of
rules to govern a group.

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.540
And that these different
innovation groups

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:09.870
share a lot of rules.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.320
So, that's the key
concept here that we're

00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.930
going to be playing when we
discuss our great groups here

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:15.490
in class.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:22.215
And they run through--

00:11:22.215 --> 00:11:24.090
I'll just run through
some of the basic rules

00:11:24.090 --> 00:11:26.160
that you all, you know,
by now are familiar with,

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.260
but they argue that greatness
starts with superb people.

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:33.520
And they quote Bob
Taylor of Xerox PARC,

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.270
you can't pile together
enough good people

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.550
to make a great one.

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.490
That great groups and great
leaders both need each other,

00:11:42.490 --> 00:11:44.650
and create each other,
and enable each other,

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.080
that it's not leadership
alone, it's the group

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:50.530
and the group needs leadership.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:52.630
But the leadership have
got to be able to play off

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.670
of and interact with a group.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.410
And we'll see different
leadership styles

00:11:58.410 --> 00:12:00.130
in putting these
great groups together

00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:02.860
as we talk about
these groups today.

00:12:02.860 --> 00:12:06.230
Great group leaders love
talent and know how to find it.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.730
Right.

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:08.290
That's to create
a great group you

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:10.060
got have great talent in it.

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:14.690
And a role of the great group
leader is to find that talent.

00:12:14.690 --> 00:12:18.670
The talent in great
groups can work together.

00:12:18.670 --> 00:12:20.980
And in the Oppenheimer
story, Beth,

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.220
you're going to tell us some
of the dissonance points

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:28.060
I'm sure in that great group.

00:12:28.060 --> 00:12:30.580
And certainly-- and Martin
and the Bardeen, Brattain,

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:32.440
and Shockley story,
you're going to tell us

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:35.020
about some of the dissidents
in that great group

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.530
that kind of blew it up.

00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:40.010
Great groups like to think
they're on a mission from God.

00:12:40.010 --> 00:12:41.547
In other words,
they have to believe

00:12:41.547 --> 00:12:43.380
that this is the most
important mission that

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:44.505
could ever possibly happen.

00:12:44.505 --> 00:12:46.450
Otherwise, they
never get anywhere.

00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.800
So they have enormous zeal.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:49.440
Right.

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.450
And it's almost a
kind of religious zeal

00:12:51.450 --> 00:12:55.590
as they embark on
their projects.

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.810
They wear blinders.

00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.470
In other words, they can
focus only on their project.

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:07.960
They can stay on task And
make that their entire focus.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:10.450
Otherwise, again,
would they get there?

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.770
They are optimistic.

00:13:11.770 --> 00:13:13.960
They are not realistic.

00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.470
So, if they were realistic
about what they were attempting,

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.790
they would never try it.

00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:22.700
But, because they
are optimists, they

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.670
have the willingness to
persevere in the expectation

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.120
that something is
going to happen.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.310
Great groups are islands,
but they have a bridge

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:31.180
to the mainland.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.250
So, Luyao, when she tells us
about the Xerox PARC story,

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:37.240
is going to tell us the
classic island bridge story.

00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:41.100
But typically, great
groups need to get put

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:44.040
on an island, a
protected island,

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.870
out of the control
of bureaucracies,

00:13:45.870 --> 00:13:49.260
out of the control
of the suits, where

00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.880
they can do their
own thing, where

00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.040
they can come up
with their inventions

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.650
and then innovations.

00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.110
But, nothing happens
to those innovations

00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:01.490
unless they have a bridge
back to decision makers

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.350
that enable those technologies
to get effectuated,

00:14:04.350 --> 00:14:06.210
to be put into place.

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:08.370
Great groups have an enemy.

00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.880
Probably the most
famous in your time,

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.380
maybe you're all
too young for this,

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.590
remember those big blue
commercials that Steve Jobs ran

00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:19.530
during super bowls?

00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:27.930
You know attacking IBM and its
minions who were wearing suits

00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.470
in this kind of dark
Orwellian advertisement

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:34.000
talking about Apple
is up against this,

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.230
you know, authoritarian
IBM enemy.

00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.950
Right.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:41.020
It was a shocking
ad at the time.

00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:43.020
But it gives you a
very good example

00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.050
of just how it felt to
be at Apple pushing up

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:51.750
against IBM's PC trying to
get your Mac out the door.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:56.270
Great groups have the right
person in the right job.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:59.810
They have to avoid what we could
call Hollywood syndrome, right,

00:14:59.810 --> 00:15:01.040
where everybody is a star.

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.920
They've got to find ways by
which everybody contributes,

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:07.690
and has a critical area
that they can handle.

00:15:07.690 --> 00:15:11.630
The groups give their talent
whatever they need to thrive,

00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:15.680
and they free them
from anything else.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.570
The group needs protection
from the outside forces.

00:15:18.570 --> 00:15:21.120
Typically these groups
are very high morale.

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.855
They're having a wonderful time.

00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.480
They're having the
time of their lives.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.280
It is , funny and
exciting, and it's 24/7,

00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:33.030
but they're having the
times of the lives.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:36.000
And when they write later
about what it was like,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.170
these are high points
in their lives.

00:15:39.170 --> 00:15:42.140
Tyranny destroys
the collaboration.

00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.330
So, in a way, they've
got to be, and we'll

00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.690
see different leadership
styles because it's by no means

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.510
always democratic, but
there's got to be an ability

00:15:50.510 --> 00:15:52.230
to pitch in and contribute.

00:15:52.230 --> 00:15:52.830
Yeah, Max?

00:15:53.007 --> 00:15:53.860
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was just going to ask

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.980
how does Apple fit in there?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:55.430
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, well, it's

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.290
going to be a very
interesting set of questions.

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:57.770
MARTIN: Yeah.

00:15:57.770 --> 00:15:58.340
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
And maybe we'll

00:15:58.340 --> 00:16:01.040
raise that when we think about
how Thomas Edison operates

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:03.920
as a leader in that kind
of 19th century leadership

00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:07.390
context, which is
different than our era.

00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:08.750
Teams are collaborative.

00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:11.470
They need to be flat and
non-hierarchical, and pretty

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.740
democratic.

00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:16.920
A lot of these rules we
start to see in the Rad Lab,

00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:20.160
this is kind of how
the Rad Lab functions

00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.350
in developing the first
federally funded research

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.365
and development center,
creating the model for that.

00:16:25.365 --> 00:16:29.100
The Rad Lab follows
a lot of these rules.

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:31.920
They use the challenge
mission, challenge model.

00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:33.360
In other words,
they've got to be

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:35.320
solving a really big problem.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.410
This is not curiosity
driven research.

00:16:37.410 --> 00:16:39.350
This is problem solving.

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:42.690
It's solving a challenge.

00:16:42.690 --> 00:16:44.240
You have to ship.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.930
In other words,
there comes a time

00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:48.870
when you have to get
something out of the door.

00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:51.180
You've got to be able
to set a time frame

00:16:51.180 --> 00:16:55.980
and move out your technology
within a plausible time period

00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.230
to actually get into a market.

00:16:58.230 --> 00:17:01.670
Xerox PARC has a lot of
trouble with this rule.

00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:04.724
You know, as we'll talk about
when we get to Xerox PARC.

00:17:04.724 --> 00:17:06.599
The group needs to have
a continuous learning

00:17:06.599 --> 00:17:07.210
environment.

00:17:07.210 --> 00:17:08.760
So, in other words, they're
all learning from each other,

00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.218
and they need to have a setting
by which they can bring out

00:17:11.218 --> 00:17:13.560
each other's skill sets
and teach each other

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:15.040
on a continuous kind of basis.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:20.940
And Oppenheimer provides some
interesting insights on this.

00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:25.670
I think those are
kind of key rules.

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:30.380
And then, we're going to
turn now to our colleagues

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.230
to present their
particular great group.

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:37.460
So, we'll get the three kind
of earlier great groups will

00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.470
each of you all will
present on those

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.700
and kind of get those
out on the table.

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:45.950
And you've got about 10 minutes
or so to tell their story

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:48.402
and explain their
rule set and what

00:17:48.402 --> 00:17:50.360
additional rules they
kind of came up with that

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.430
are relevant here.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:54.560
Clear so far?

00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.030
All right.

00:17:56.030 --> 00:17:59.237
So, Martin, why don't
we do Edison first?

00:17:59.237 --> 00:18:02.100
MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:04.675
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
There's Edison.

00:18:04.675 --> 00:18:06.050
MARTIN: I think
with Edison, it's

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:07.630
important to kind of look
at him as an individual

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.730
first, and then also the
organization and group

00:18:09.730 --> 00:18:11.500
he created after.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.940
So, Edison came from a
relatively poor family.

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.310
He kind of made his own ways.

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:20.560
He's kind of like the original
self-made American inventor.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.110
He started off self-taught
because he was kind of deaf,

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:27.110
so he couldn't really
learn in a school setting.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:29.448
So, his self-taught
him math at home.

00:18:29.448 --> 00:18:31.240
And so, that also gives
him an original way

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.500
of looking at problems.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.830
He's not really used to
following social construct

00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:36.890
as well.

00:18:36.890 --> 00:18:38.812
And then, he gets a
job on the railroad

00:18:38.812 --> 00:18:40.270
where as he's going
on the railroad

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.340
he sees a lot of
different things.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.882
So, he's somebody
who kind of becomes

00:18:42.882 --> 00:18:45.580
street smart as time evolves.

00:18:45.580 --> 00:18:48.430
And he is inventing
things and learning

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:49.600
while he's on the railroad.

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:53.170
So, there's a funny story about
him having his own little mini

00:18:53.170 --> 00:18:57.062
lab on a railroad which,
you know, it's pretty funny.

00:18:57.062 --> 00:18:59.020
And so people wouldn't
steal certain chemicals,

00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:01.680
he would like list
them as poison.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.790
And then, so that's kind
of like his development

00:19:03.790 --> 00:19:04.720
into adolescence.

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:07.400
And as he grows up and
kind of becomes an adult,

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.370
he gets relatively lucky.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.860
But he has all these hours
of experience of inventing,

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.035
and he invents this
thing called the--

00:19:14.035 --> 00:19:15.570
let me get the name here--

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:16.945
it's like the
quadruple telegraph

00:19:16.945 --> 00:19:19.330
which what he sells
for what would

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:21.850
be the equivalent
of $200,000 today.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:26.710
And that's what he uses
as the initial money

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:29.740
investment to make his
lab at Menlo Park, which

00:19:29.740 --> 00:19:32.920
is considered, I think, one
of the first great American

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.300
research labs.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.800
So, for him, it's
pretty interesting

00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:38.410
because he's relatively
street smart understands,

00:19:38.410 --> 00:19:39.940
the technology,
understands what he

00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.898
doesn't know about the
science, and understands

00:19:41.898 --> 00:19:42.880
the individuals.

00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:46.242
So, as he comes in, he is
kind of a strong leader.

00:19:46.242 --> 00:19:48.700
But what he does that's unique
is he finds different people

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.658
with different talents.

00:19:49.658 --> 00:19:52.780
Not just academic, but also
people who can build things.

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:54.415
People that have
experience shipping.

00:19:54.415 --> 00:19:56.290
People have leadership
abilities because he's

00:19:56.290 --> 00:19:58.720
kind of had this kind of--

00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:00.467
His 10,000 hours
isn't just science,

00:20:00.467 --> 00:20:02.050
it's also been the
ability to interact

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:04.133
with a variety of people
and see how they actually

00:20:04.133 --> 00:20:06.315
work in a real-life setting.

00:20:06.315 --> 00:20:08.190
So I think what would
be interesting with him

00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:09.450
was to go through the Bennis.

00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.093
Kind of some of
the characteristics

00:20:11.093 --> 00:20:12.760
of strong groups and
kind of relate them

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.396
to how he did it at Menlo Park.

00:20:16.396 --> 00:20:20.740
Let me see if I can find this.

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:21.430
OK.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:23.710
So, need certain conditions.

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.760
Focus.

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.760
So, Menlo Park
was really a ranch

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.700
that he originally bought
with his house in the back.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:33.370
So, being the leader, he
kind of took it upon himself

00:20:33.370 --> 00:20:35.980
to place it near his home.

00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.895
But, he actually rarely
went into his house.

00:20:38.895 --> 00:20:41.020
So, his wife lived in the
back, and he would always

00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.860
be in the shop of Menlo Park
always working with the people

00:20:44.860 --> 00:20:45.430
there.

00:20:45.430 --> 00:20:47.230
To the point that one time,
he walked into his house

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:49.250
and his wife hadn't seen
him in about a week.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:52.180
So, she thought it
was an intruder.

00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.702
So that kind of focus.

00:20:53.702 --> 00:20:54.410
Just to give it--

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:54.490
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
She almost shot him.

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:54.990
Right?

00:20:55.317 --> 00:20:55.375
MARTIN: Yeah.

00:20:55.375 --> 00:20:55.920
Yeah.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:21:00.467
Yeah, I mean, I don't
want to imply, but yeah.

00:21:00.467 --> 00:21:01.300
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.985
MARTIN: Light bulb moment.

00:21:03.985 --> 00:21:05.110
Have everyone in one place.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:06.970
As I mentioned, they're
there in Menlo Park.

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.670
And he has these
great individuals.

00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.630
Isolate them.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:12.820
They are kind of isolated
in their own skill set,

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.320
but they can always collaborate.

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.060
It is a flat model.

00:21:16.060 --> 00:21:18.970
There's only really two
floors I think in Menlo Park.

00:21:18.970 --> 00:21:21.890
And then, he did choose
to expand slightly later,

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:24.460
but it wasn't highly isolated.

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:25.690
No distractions.

00:21:25.690 --> 00:21:29.300
They were away from what I
would say like other people.

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.240
So it was an island.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.310
Atmosphere stress,
they did have stress

00:21:33.310 --> 00:21:35.170
because they did have deadlines.

00:21:35.170 --> 00:21:37.027
And they're also very prolific.

00:21:37.027 --> 00:21:38.110
I forget how many patents.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:39.430
You might know the number.

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:43.450
I know Edison has around 1000
patents by time of his death.

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:46.198
I think-- I don't want to give
a wrong number because it's

00:21:46.198 --> 00:21:47.740
hard to find, but
I know that they're

00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:50.990
very prolific in terms of
assuming a patent like a week.

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.320
Something like that.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.990
Because the talent, but
also like I mentioned,

00:21:55.990 --> 00:21:57.870
Edison was street
smart, so they knew

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:00.520
but things are kind of ready to
invent and put out there right

00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.450
away.

00:22:01.450 --> 00:22:03.130
So, most of the patents
were all utility

00:22:03.130 --> 00:22:10.288
based in terms of mechanical,
electrical, magnetism.

00:22:10.288 --> 00:22:11.080
And a lot of them--

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:13.580
I think there's only 14 patents
for Menlo Park for something

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.840
that was design related.

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:17.570
So, it's very much focusing
on what they were good at,

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:21.980
which was kind of this
applied science area.

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.620
Island with bridge to mainland.

00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.330
They were the island.

00:22:26.330 --> 00:22:28.630
The ability to
sell, Edison already

00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:30.703
knew from past
inventions, so that

00:22:30.703 --> 00:22:31.870
wasn't as much of a problem.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.730
But it does fit that
framework roughly.

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:34.870
I would say.

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:36.070
Winning underdogs.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:37.340
They did have competitors.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:38.590
They're not as famous
as, you know, apples

00:22:38.590 --> 00:22:39.882
competitors or other companies.

00:22:39.882 --> 00:22:42.350
But they did know that
at this time period,

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:45.350
a lot of different people
were making inventions

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.692
to run electricity, and
it was a market that there

00:22:47.692 --> 00:22:49.150
was a lot of
competitors coming in,

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:51.850
and you really had
to fight to win.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:54.610
Even though they were utilities,
the dynamics of the markets

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:56.890
weren't as they are now.

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.390
Have an enemy.

00:22:58.390 --> 00:23:01.900
That goes back to their
opponents optimism.

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.180
And not really realistic.

00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:06.277
They would just try
things to try things,

00:23:06.277 --> 00:23:07.360
to see if they would work.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:09.568
And sometimes, they would
work or would not work out.

00:23:09.568 --> 00:23:11.450
Right person for the right job.

00:23:11.450 --> 00:23:12.580
Give them what they need.

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:14.190
They had a ton of resources.

00:23:14.190 --> 00:23:16.770
Let me bring up a example.

00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.120
A newspaper article
printed in 1887

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.710
reveals the seriousness
of his claim

00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:23.710
saying the lab contain
8,000 kinds of chemicals,

00:23:23.710 --> 00:23:26.320
every kind of screw made,
every size of needle

00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:29.770
every kind of quarter wired,
hair of humans, horses, hogs,

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:32.060
cows, rabbits, goats,
minxes, camels,

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:33.790
so silk in every
texture, cocoons,

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:36.580
various kinds of hooves,
shark's teeth, deer's horns,

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:39.760
tortoise shells, cork
resin, varnish and oil,

00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.710
ostrich feathers, peacock tails,
jet, amber, rubber, all auras,

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:47.270
and the list goes on.

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:49.930
So I mean that--

00:23:49.930 --> 00:23:50.730
AUDIENCE: Why?

00:23:50.730 --> 00:23:52.520
AUDIENCE: He was a hoarder.

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:53.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:54.785
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:23:54.785 --> 00:23:56.410
MARTIN: Yeah, well,
at the time there's

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:57.340
different theories of science.

00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:57.610
Right.

00:23:57.610 --> 00:23:59.110
So, they weren't
as refined, so they

00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.340
would try different things.

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.340
And also, he probably
left room for things

00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:06.295
that weren't mainstream
science at the time

00:24:06.295 --> 00:24:08.170
to try different theories
because if you have

00:24:08.170 --> 00:24:09.910
an expert that says, oh, I
know how to do this and this,

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.270
but it's not explained by the
current theory of science,

00:24:12.270 --> 00:24:13.937
he would still give
them a shot usually.

00:24:13.937 --> 00:24:15.604
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So, these presumably

00:24:15.604 --> 00:24:17.400
are all for filaments
to get across the two

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.080
electrical poles.

00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.340
He's got to find the
right filament that's--

00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:22.360
MARTIN: And I think
what the right problem

00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:23.060
at the right time.

00:24:23.060 --> 00:24:24.518
Like Edison wasn't
the first person

00:24:24.518 --> 00:24:25.810
to create the light bulb.

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.150
He perfected the design so
it can last longer than,

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:30.850
I forget if it was five
seconds or five minutes,

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:33.393
so it could last for
extended periods of time.

00:24:33.393 --> 00:24:35.560
So, that's another gamble,
finding the right problem

00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:36.770
at the right time.

00:24:36.770 --> 00:24:38.740
And it's something that
we see in tech a lot.

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:42.760
Like the I think the
Newton from Apple

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:45.420
was like an original was
pretty much the iPad,

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.960
but it just was the wrong time.

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:49.270
Also, I think Oracle
came out with something

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:52.930
that was like the book
like in the late 90s,

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:54.950
and it didn't sell
because it was too early.

00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:57.492
And not a lot of people on the
internet yet, and there wasn't

00:24:57.492 --> 00:24:59.260
Wi-Fi.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.340
So, I think those
kind of showcase

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:04.000
some of the examples of
how Menlo Park was run.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.970
It was definitely kind
of like a hierarchy

00:25:06.970 --> 00:25:10.270
where Edison kind of
made the decisions,

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:11.950
but he would make
more hard decisions,

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:13.492
which is important
as well because it

00:25:13.492 --> 00:25:14.800
gets rid of complexity.

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.820
And allows people-- usually,
if you make a quick decision,

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.753
it's better group because
you'll go that way,

00:25:19.753 --> 00:25:22.170
and if it doesn't work you
just move on to the next thing,

00:25:22.170 --> 00:25:24.030
but people aren't debating
about, oh, let's do this

00:25:24.030 --> 00:25:25.500
or that for a long
period of time.

00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.167
So, there's also when
you're there, just

00:25:27.167 --> 00:25:28.930
focusing on doing the work.

00:25:28.930 --> 00:25:32.010
So, those are some of
the characteristics

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.630
of this great group
in Menlo Park.

00:25:34.267 --> 00:25:35.850
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
You know, maybe we

00:25:35.850 --> 00:25:38.402
ought to do Q&A now rather
than kind of bunch these up.

00:25:38.402 --> 00:25:40.360
Let me just share a couple
of thoughts with you

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.120
from these photographs.

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.720
That's the invention factory.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.830
And then, back behind this is
the house, the old farmhouse

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.100
where Edison theoretically
lived with his wife,

00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.130
although he's spending
almost all his time here.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:25:57.190
And that's the team.

00:25:57.190 --> 00:25:57.690
Right.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.100
That's the group.

00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:01.650
And there's the group,
right, on the first floor

00:26:01.650 --> 00:26:03.330
of this building.

00:26:03.330 --> 00:26:07.080
And it's an interesting
amalgam of talents.

00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:10.900
So, there's some engineers
and scientists in here,

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.480
but there's tremendous artisans.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.150
Since they have to
invent the vacuum tube,

00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.290
in effect, they have
a great glass blower.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:19.900
Right.

00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.740
So, it's a very
interesting mix of we

00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.190
call them experimentalists
and theoreticians are,

00:26:27.190 --> 00:26:28.750
you know, combined
in this space.

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:31.150
But a remarkable ability
to work together,

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:35.530
and Martin has well described
some of the rules that

00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:36.970
apply to them.

00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:39.100
They're having a good time.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:45.630
So, they're often up ridiculous
hours of day and night.

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:51.280
And they have a, you know,
they have an old stove.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:55.270
And after midnight, they
gather around the stove.

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:59.440
So, rap has not been invented,
but they shout doggerel poetry

00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:03.100
to each other that's humorous
at the top of their lungs.

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.710
And Mrs. Edison
brings by cherry pies.

00:27:06.710 --> 00:27:07.480
All right.

00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:11.290
So, they feast around
the old pot-bellied stove

00:27:11.290 --> 00:27:13.885
eating pie and shouting
doggerel poetry at each other.

00:27:13.885 --> 00:27:15.760
It gives you an idea of
the kind of adventure

00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:17.410
that they were having together.

00:27:17.410 --> 00:27:22.460
And on the island bridge
point that Martin made,

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:27.590
a key set of relationships
that Edison was able to form

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:31.860
was that telegraphing in
effect like quadruplexing

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:32.820
by telegraph.

00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:36.510
The ability to send multiple
messages over the same line.

00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:40.290
That really enables the stock
ticker and a tremendous amount

00:27:40.290 --> 00:27:42.900
of exchange of financial
information for stock

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.190
exchanges.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.770
So, buying could
occur at a distance.

00:27:46.770 --> 00:27:49.080
You could place orders from
all over the country, which

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:51.690
really is foundational
for Wall Street.

00:27:51.690 --> 00:27:54.300
So, people like JP Morgan
completely understood

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.630
the power of this and have
a relationship with Edison.

00:27:57.630 --> 00:28:01.110
So, the Edison crowd is
all off in this rural farm

00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:05.910
on an island, but Edison has
got a bridge back to JP Morgan.

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:10.360
So, when they figure out the
light bulb, and the system that

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.190
goes with it, which
I'll get to in a second,

00:28:14.190 --> 00:28:17.100
he's got a way to reach a
decision maker who can actually

00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:18.910
stand up to technology.

00:28:18.910 --> 00:28:19.410
Right.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.760
And that's really crucial.

00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.850
So, that invention earlier
that he came up with

00:28:23.850 --> 00:28:27.180
is really the enabler
for this whole project.

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.610
They have to ship
because, as Martin says,

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.130
they've got a limited amount
of money, which they're burning

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.090
through by purchasing every
bizarre thing you can think of,

00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:40.130
as you just ran through
the great list of.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:42.767
So, it's driven by
the need to ship.

00:28:42.767 --> 00:28:44.600
They're going to have
to get this thing done

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:47.160
before their money runs out.

00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.080
So, they're working all hours
with incredible intensity

00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.400
to try and do it.

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:57.290
This is not just the
invention of the light bulb.

00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.730
They have to invent--

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:01.910
a light bulb is worthless
without an electrical system

00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:03.330
to go with it.

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.810
So, one of the things
that Edison and his crew

00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.420
figure out they
essentially have to invent

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.865
the entire public utility model.

00:29:10.865 --> 00:29:12.740
So, they got a light
bulb, which is a useless

00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:16.400
product unless you have an
electrical system go with it.

00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:20.233
So, they have to think
through power systems.

00:29:20.233 --> 00:29:21.650
They have to think
through safety.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:23.750
They have to figure
out generators.

00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:26.090
They have to figure out
the organizational model

00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:29.132
for utilities in order to
understand how this whole thing

00:29:29.132 --> 00:29:29.840
is going to work.

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.200
So, they've got a
dream product that's

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.110
going to displace, you know, gas
lighting, which was incredibly

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:42.080
dangerous, blew up all the time,
with a much safer, inherently

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.005
safer system, which provided
much better quality light.

00:29:46.005 --> 00:29:47.630
So, they've got a
dream product, but it

00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:51.170
doesn't work unless they
do the entire innovation

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.080
system for electricity along
with it, which is really

00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.050
what their accomplishment is.

00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:56.575
Right.

00:29:56.575 --> 00:29:58.700
It's understanding and
being able to put into place

00:29:58.700 --> 00:30:01.820
the whole system, and then
using their bridge back

00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:04.820
to the financial world
to get it financed.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:08.270
So, those are just a few points
building on Martin's, you know,

00:30:08.270 --> 00:30:11.140
good summary, but let's do some
questions on the Edison group.

00:30:14.074 --> 00:30:16.030
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:16.030 --> 00:30:19.310
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah,
why don't you fire some out?

00:30:19.310 --> 00:30:21.607
OK.

00:30:21.607 --> 00:30:23.940
MARTIN: How effective would
an Edison-style research lab

00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.330
be today?

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.720
So, there's like a really
good show called pure genius

00:30:27.720 --> 00:30:30.290
right now where it's
a billionaire who

00:30:30.290 --> 00:30:32.670
like makes a hospital
where he kind of does

00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:33.830
something like this.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.247
But I just wonder if anybody
had any interesting thoughts.

00:30:40.842 --> 00:30:42.300
AUDIENCE: I feel
like it definitely

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:43.950
depends on the application.

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:46.110
Like, what they're
interested in working on.

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.880
Because I feel like
this translates

00:30:47.880 --> 00:30:51.610
well when the capital
expenses are lower,

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.940
but if you're trying
to do research

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:58.590
on energy or large
infrastructure stuff,

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.750
I feel like it would be
hard for a single person

00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:01.790
to finance that today.

00:31:01.790 --> 00:31:03.320
Like, even this is
pretty impressive

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:08.220
that you could build such a
complex company from a garage

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.660
basically.

00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:11.640
But, I mean we see
like Apple essentially

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:14.080
started a similar process.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.920
So, that's something that kind
of can start small and grow.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:20.447
I think it could
still work today.

00:31:20.447 --> 00:31:22.530
AUDIENCE: I don't really
see very many differences

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.570
between this and Facebook.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:28.140
It seems very similar very--

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:31.380
well, but again it follows
that model of the quote

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.940
unquote great group because
it's everyone's focused,

00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:35.070
you've got a ton of
people that are only

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:36.060
working on the project.

00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:37.727
They've got all the
resources they need.

00:31:37.727 --> 00:31:41.920
And they just like to work,
and they have a great time.

00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:43.736
MARTIN: So, say like
somebody is trying

00:31:43.736 --> 00:31:45.910
to do this for like fusion,
like instead of the Manhattan

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:47.368
Project, it's the
Manhattan Project

00:31:47.368 --> 00:31:49.660
2.0 where they're trying to
figure out a fusion energy

00:31:49.660 --> 00:31:50.230
device.

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:52.660
Do you think a small
group of talented people

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.720
will be able to do it?

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:55.887
MAX: I think it'd be awesome,
and I'd love to do it.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.170
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: You know,
Max, I think you're right.

00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:05.080
This is the iconic picture.

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.560
That's the group.

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:08.950
And it's all in a
room, and they're all

00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:10.780
in rich communication
with each other.

00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:14.960
I think that
picture gets carried

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.518
through into most
of the great groups

00:32:16.518 --> 00:32:17.810
that we're going to talk about.

00:32:17.810 --> 00:32:19.256
MARTIN: And then
another question

00:32:19.256 --> 00:32:22.562
I had based on this group
was, do you think universities

00:32:22.562 --> 00:32:24.520
should focus on getting
a variety of skill sets

00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.140
to interact with
the researchers?

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:28.858
Because usually it's
academics, or they're

00:32:28.858 --> 00:32:30.400
used to doing
research, but they only

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.960
see a problem a certain way.

00:32:31.960 --> 00:32:34.000
Versus somebody who would
be more street smart

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.370
or has a more technical
ability to just build things,

00:32:36.370 --> 00:32:39.778
they would-- it might
lead to richer solutions.

00:32:39.778 --> 00:32:41.650
MAX: So what's the question?

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:43.150
MARTIN: So should
universities focus

00:32:43.150 --> 00:32:45.820
on getting people that
aren't from universities

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:48.070
that are talented in science?

00:32:48.070 --> 00:32:49.540
So it could be electricians.

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.032
It can be material scientists.

00:32:52.032 --> 00:32:52.990
MAX: Oh, so [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:52.990 --> 00:32:54.510
MARTIN: People who do things,
rather than just people who

00:32:54.510 --> 00:32:55.470
have gone to college.

00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:57.220
AUDIENCE: To teach,
is that what you mean?

00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:57.730
MARTIN: No, not to teach.

00:32:57.730 --> 00:32:59.660
To collaborate in
a research setting.

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.217
AUDIENCE: OK, OK.

00:33:01.217 --> 00:33:03.800
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I think it's
really an important question,

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.310
because we've begun to talk
about the increasing economic

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:11.270
role of universities, through
the Bayh-Dole Act, for example,

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:15.200
and the fact that universities
now control patents on the--

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.390
and the researchers
control the patents

00:33:17.390 --> 00:33:20.480
on their federally-funded
research.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.910
And the pressure's
on universities

00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:24.800
to play more and more
of an economic role.

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:28.650
As the old historic
industrial labs come down,

00:33:28.650 --> 00:33:30.065
the university role grows.

00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:38.390
If this is the iconic
picture, are there

00:33:38.390 --> 00:33:41.420
settings in universities
that look like this,

00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:45.620
or is it only two or
three people in the room?

00:33:45.620 --> 00:33:50.160
I think that's a really
intriguing question.

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.472
Martin, what do you think?

00:33:52.472 --> 00:33:53.930
MARTIN: I think
you should probably

00:33:53.930 --> 00:33:57.280
have people, just because a
lot of things, in theory--

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.110
well, and another is, if
you think about the world

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:02.290
in terms of theories that
we haven't discovered yet

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:04.670
or things we haven't
discovered and our theories

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:06.140
aren't perfect.

00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:08.960
The way I would see it
is somebody who has--

00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.020
say somebody who's
built an electrical grid

00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.812
and played around with
different materials,

00:34:12.812 --> 00:34:14.360
they have 10,000
hours in things that

00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.277
might not have a theory
for it yet-- they just

00:34:16.277 --> 00:34:18.350
know it happens.

00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.385
So they might be able
to say, well, you think,

00:34:20.385 --> 00:34:22.010
theoretically, this
is going to happen.

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:23.090
This is what you're certain of.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.840
But based on some of
the stuff I've seen--

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:26.360
I've seen this.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.800
Maybe we should just try it out.

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:30.258
And I think that might be a
really interesting proposition.

00:34:37.427 --> 00:34:39.219
AUDIENCE: I wonder if
it makes a difference

00:34:39.219 --> 00:34:45.730
though whether you're inventing
a scientific advancement,

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.269
or if it's just a product
with maybe no new technology,

00:34:49.269 --> 00:34:53.270
but putting things together
that consumers want.

00:34:53.270 --> 00:34:57.100
So I think with Facebook, I
consider it more like a product

00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.940
not necessarily
invented something new.

00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:05.830
Whereas with Edison, they
said he had an intuitive

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:09.010
understanding of Ohm's
law and putting together

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.750
the light bulb.

00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:13.720
But I feel like
now it's probably

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.720
even more of a challenge to make
scientific advancements just

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:19.750
from tinkering around, just
because a lot has already

00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:21.080
been done.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:21.622
MARTIN: Yeah.

00:35:21.622 --> 00:35:22.750
But I would say there's
also an opportunity,

00:35:22.750 --> 00:35:24.340
because if you look at--

00:35:24.340 --> 00:35:29.080
there's waves of technology,
like it's STS theme or certain

00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:32.390
ways of doing things come into
fashion, and then they don't.

00:35:32.390 --> 00:35:34.660
So a lot of the great
scientists of the 1800s

00:35:34.660 --> 00:35:36.728
built things, and would
just build things and not

00:35:36.728 --> 00:35:38.770
really try to come up with
a mathematical theory.

00:35:38.770 --> 00:35:41.230
Versus today, you come up
with a mathematical theory,

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:42.490
and then go and try it.

00:35:42.490 --> 00:35:44.830
So there's less people
just trying random things.

00:35:44.830 --> 00:35:46.000
So there might be
a huge opportunity

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.583
there because, with all the new
insights and all the new data,

00:35:48.583 --> 00:35:50.260
you could try
interesting things.

00:35:54.123 --> 00:35:56.040
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: All
right, so why don't we

00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:59.700
leave Edison and
shift over to Beth,

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:03.565
who is going to do Oppenheimer?

00:36:03.565 --> 00:36:06.460
BETH: OK, so again before I
go into the Manhattan Project

00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:09.040
specifically, I wanted to
talk a little bit about Robert

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.850
Oppenheimer a person.

00:36:10.850 --> 00:36:13.360
He had a pretty
fascinating life--

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:17.020
a little bit tragic, but he
really contributed a lot.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.080
So he went to Harvard and
finished his chemistry degree

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.680
in three years, and then
started on a PhD in physics

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.125
at Cambridge under JJ
Thompson, who maybe

00:36:26.125 --> 00:36:28.260
is someone you've heard of.

00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:30.393
But completed his
painting in Germany,

00:36:30.393 --> 00:36:32.560
where he had the opportunity
to meet a lot of really

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:34.510
famous scientists of the day--

00:36:34.510 --> 00:36:38.470
Bohr, Heisenberg,
[INAUDIBLE],, et cetera.

00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.080
After that, he went to work
at Berkeley as a professor.

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:43.140
So he was really
building his network

00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:45.970
and knew really all the
preeminent physicists

00:36:45.970 --> 00:36:50.050
of his day worked
there [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:50.050 --> 00:36:55.660
Something that will continue
to haunt him and affect

00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.560
how he works is that he did
have multiple affiliations left

00:36:59.560 --> 00:37:01.630
organizations while he was--

00:37:01.630 --> 00:37:03.970
especially while he was younger.

00:37:03.970 --> 00:37:07.707
So as the Red Scare
comes about in the '50s,

00:37:07.707 --> 00:37:09.790
and even as he's working
on the Manhattan Project,

00:37:09.790 --> 00:37:12.820
there are a lot of times
that these affiliations come

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:16.210
into question, and people
doubt his loyalties.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:17.860
So that's something that--

00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.200
it's just interesting to note.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:22.000
And obviously, he
was selected to lead

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.813
the development of the
atomic bombs at Los Alamos.

00:37:25.813 --> 00:37:27.730
I do just want to talk
a little bit about what

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:29.410
happened to him after
the war, before we

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:33.880
spent the majority of the time
talking about his war efforts.

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:38.020
So in 1947, after
the war, he started

00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:42.240
working in Princeton at the
Institute for Advanced Studies.

00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.320
So that's where
Einstein was, as well.

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:49.030
So he was working with a
bunch of really smart people.

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:52.630
But then in 1949, he's called
to the House Un-American

00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:54.150
Activities Committee.

00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:58.030
And in 1953, his security
clearance was revoked.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:00.100
So a lot of scientists
did come speak out

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:03.220
on his behalf,
including Vannevar Bush,

00:38:03.220 --> 00:38:05.890
Edward Teller, who will
make an appearance later

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:07.870
in my discussion--

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:11.590
said some comments that
weren't expressly negative,

00:38:11.590 --> 00:38:15.347
but were very much did not hold
Oppenheimer's cause at all.

00:38:15.347 --> 00:38:17.430
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: It
really led to his downfall.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.910
BETH: Yeah.

00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:21.670
They were kind of wishy-washy
in what he actually said,

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.180
but it was used
against him a lot,

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.450
and eventually it really
contributed to the fact

00:38:25.450 --> 00:38:28.210
that he was no longer allowed
to have a security clearance

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:33.130
and really was pushed out of
the political field of science.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:36.100
So as a result of
that, he withdrew

00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.335
from political activity--

00:38:38.335 --> 00:38:39.710
kind of because
he was forced to.

00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:42.120
So he moved to the
US Virgin Islands.

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:44.080
And he worked a little
bit independently

00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:49.663
on the nuclear field, but lost
a lot of his influence outside

00:38:49.663 --> 00:38:50.830
of the scientific community.

00:38:50.830 --> 00:38:52.288
So within the
scientific community,

00:38:52.288 --> 00:38:55.360
I think a lot of people still
held him in high regard,

00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:59.290
but his opinions and his work
wasn't really listened to

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:02.410
by people outside.

00:39:02.410 --> 00:39:06.790
Finally, in 1963, he got
a political rehabilitation

00:39:06.790 --> 00:39:12.150
when JFK awarded him
the Enrico Fermi Award.

00:39:12.150 --> 00:39:14.465
This obviously didn't
leave him much time

00:39:14.465 --> 00:39:16.590
to contribute after that,
because unfortunately, he

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:21.720
was diagnosed with lung cancer
and died a few years after.

00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.430
Yeah, he was a bit of a
chain smoker, unforunately.

00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:29.460
But it's kind of sad to
see this downfall of,

00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:33.330
as well discuss in the next
slides, a great leader who

00:39:33.330 --> 00:39:36.520
stepped up to the job
in a time of crisis.

00:39:36.520 --> 00:39:40.060
All right, so now for the main
focus, the Manhattan Project.

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:43.390
So the picture on the left is
an aerial view the Los Alamos

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:45.760
laboratory, and on
the right and some

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:47.880
famous names of people
who worked there,

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:51.910
including Bohr,
Feynman, and Fermi.

00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:53.890
So the Manhattan
Project's goal, as I think

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:55.570
most people are aware of, is--

00:39:55.570 --> 00:39:58.000
was to build the nuclear
bomb, essentially

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.230
before the Nazis did.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:02.830
That was the
ultimate motivation.

00:40:02.830 --> 00:40:05.360
And it really is an
example of a great group.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.822
As I'll go through
the next slide,

00:40:06.822 --> 00:40:08.530
it really ticks off
a bunch of the boxes,

00:40:08.530 --> 00:40:10.780
because in a very
short amount of time,

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:13.950
with pretty young group
working really hard,

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:15.910
they were able to achieve this.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:18.220
And obviously, the
nuclear bomb comes

00:40:18.220 --> 00:40:20.860
laden with a lot of ethical
and values questions, which

00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.170
I think would be
interesting to spend

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.150
most of this time talking on.

00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:30.340
Bennis mentions in his work
that professor described

00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.000
that you do run into this
potential challenge of,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.500
what if a great
group comes together

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.560
to do something that
is not very great?

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:40.810
And so from the
perspective of Americans,

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:44.100
we can view this
achievement as purely great,

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:47.770
but-- or at the time, it
was perceived as great.

00:40:47.770 --> 00:40:50.920
Now, it's obviously murkier.

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:54.730
But had this great group been
a group of German scientists

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:58.810
at the time, it would have been
a much scarier position for us.

00:40:58.810 --> 00:41:01.900
So I'll come back to that.

00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:04.500
I just wanted to tick
off a few of the elements

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.990
of a great group, and talk
about Oppenheimer's role

00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:08.870
specifically.

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:12.630
First, Oppenheimer really
was a charismatic leader.

00:41:12.630 --> 00:41:15.480
Before this, he hadn't really
had much leadership experience

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:20.040
outside of his lab itself-- so
overseeing graduate students.

00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.980
And a lot of people questioned
his choice as the leader

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:24.050
in this project.

00:41:24.050 --> 00:41:26.550
They weren't sure he had the
right temperament or experience

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.820
to do it.

00:41:27.820 --> 00:41:31.680
And a lot of his colleagues
and people who worked there did

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.240
see a noticeable change in how
he worked before versus how

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:39.840
he worked at Los Alamos, that
he really kind of stepped up

00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.280
to the task and was able to be
a very influential and effective

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:46.830
leader in this position.

00:41:46.830 --> 00:41:49.550
Since he knew basically
everyone in the physics field,

00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:52.920
he was able to attract
some really great talent,

00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:54.930
and definitely wasn't
concerned with finding

00:41:54.930 --> 00:41:58.110
people who might have
more knowledge in one area

00:41:58.110 --> 00:42:00.120
than he did.

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.760
He really emphasized the
open access to information.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.940
So they would have meetings--

00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.570
I forget if it was
weekly or monthly--

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:09.570
I think weekly-- where people
would share their research

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:11.070
with each other so
that everyone had

00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:13.950
an idea of what was going on.

00:42:13.950 --> 00:42:16.200
Some of the other
hands-off approaches

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.900
were the flexible working
hours and the freedom

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.040
to work on things
you're passionate about.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:23.490
So Teller, the guy from
the previous slide,

00:42:23.490 --> 00:42:25.470
really wanted to
develop the H bomb,

00:42:25.470 --> 00:42:28.080
and was pretty distracted
from his work that

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:30.540
was really applicable
to the work

00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.010
that they were doing at hand.

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:35.285
But Oppenheimer
realized that the way

00:42:35.285 --> 00:42:36.660
he was going to
be most effective

00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:38.252
was to just let
Teller go off and work

00:42:38.252 --> 00:42:39.210
on what he cared about.

00:42:39.210 --> 00:42:41.670
And so he allowed
people some freedom

00:42:41.670 --> 00:42:44.460
in judging what they
should be doing.

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:47.280
With this example, there
is a clear mission,

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:51.750
and there is a clear adversary,
so that was a very strong

00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:53.940
motivating factor.

00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.560
There was a sense of camaraderie
between the scientists.

00:42:56.560 --> 00:42:58.590
It did help that they
had a lot in common.

00:42:58.590 --> 00:43:04.380
It was mostly young men
interested in science.

00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:08.580
I think the average age
was 25, so it was just a--

00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.790
kind of the same thing of
hanging out around the stove.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.580
They all lived and were
pretty isolated in Los Alamos

00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.380
without much interaction.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:18.420
MAX: That's something
I thought that was odd.

00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:21.780
If they're all age 25, doesn't
that mean that a lot of them

00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.350
don't even have their PhD yet?

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:25.860
BETH: So I think, from
my interpretation,

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:29.820
people used to get their PhDs
slightly faster and younger.

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:33.480
So Oppenheimer had his at 23.

00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:34.200
So I don't know--

00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:35.950
MAX: He graduated in
three years though.

00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:36.450
BETH: Yeah.

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:38.897
MARTIN: He went college early.

00:43:38.897 --> 00:43:41.230
AUDIENCE: Maybe a lot of them
are graduate students too,

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:42.980
because a lot of the
people at the Rad Lab

00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.300
were graduate students who
are brought in by the--

00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.398
Lawrence and--

00:43:46.398 --> 00:43:47.690
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: [INAUDIBLE]

00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:50.065
AUDIENCE: They brought their
graduate students with them.

00:43:50.065 --> 00:43:50.900
20 or 21.

00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:56.200
BETH: Yeah, so young
group of people

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.270
who had a lot of
energy and enthusiasm,

00:43:58.270 --> 00:44:00.700
and really didn't have much
else that they could do,

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:03.870
because they're in the middle of
somewhat nowhere in New Mexico.

00:44:03.870 --> 00:44:05.620
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
They're on a mesa top.

00:44:05.620 --> 00:44:06.340
BETH: Yeah.

00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:07.080
AUDIENCE: Island.

00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:07.720
BETH: Yeah, very
much so an island.

00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.595
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes,
the ultimate island.

00:44:09.595 --> 00:44:13.300
BETH: Both for security purposes
and to keep them focused.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:17.580
I do think they had a bit of
the underdog attitude, as well.

00:44:17.580 --> 00:44:19.330
Whether it was true
or not, they perceived

00:44:19.330 --> 00:44:21.430
that they were behind the
Germans in development

00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:23.560
of the bomb, and
so they were very

00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:28.480
motivated to try to catch up
and to become the top dog.

00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:32.380
It did have a pretty
casual atmosphere.

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.180
It wasn't very hierarchical.

00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:36.880
There was a little
division as possible.

00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:39.160
I think the book mentioned
that Oppenheimer wrote out

00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:41.540
his ideal sketch on
a piece of paper,

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:44.710
and someone asked how
it should be organized.

00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:48.730
So it was pretty freeform.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:52.300
And lastly, he did a lot
to maintain enthusiasm

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:55.990
and to keep people excited
about working there,

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:58.480
both the scientists
themselves and the families

00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.920
that they brought with them.

00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:02.790
So part of that was everyone
had to take some days off,

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:06.120
so that had some semblance
of work life balance.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:07.540
There were a lot
of social events.

00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.773
Oppenheimer hosted some parties.

00:45:09.773 --> 00:45:11.440
And I think something
really interesting

00:45:11.440 --> 00:45:15.940
that he did was to help the
women that were brought to Los

00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:18.100
Alamos, mostly as spouses--

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.710
a few scientists,
but mostly spouses--

00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:22.743
to get more engaging
jobs than they

00:45:22.743 --> 00:45:24.160
might have been
able to otherwise.

00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.930
So rather than having them
stuck at home, isolated

00:45:28.930 --> 00:45:31.000
as housewives, he
would bring in people

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.910
who would do the house chores
for them, so that they could

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:38.980
get jobs as administrators,
or more challenging work

00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:41.920
that would keep them happier
to be there, as well.

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:49.160
But this work obviously
raised many ethical questions.

00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:51.930
And these are four
scientists that I picked out

00:45:51.930 --> 00:45:53.410
who discussed some of these.

00:45:53.410 --> 00:45:56.800
So first is Niels Bohr.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:02.140
He escaped from Denmark
and came over to the Allies

00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:04.750
during World War II.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:08.890
And he very much supported
the idea of open access

00:46:08.890 --> 00:46:11.590
to information, not just
between Britain and the US,

00:46:11.590 --> 00:46:14.260
but including the Soviet
Union in there, as well.

00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:16.420
He was afraid that leaving
the Soviet Union out

00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:19.750
of all of this work was
going to lead to an arms race

00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:21.300
after World War II.

00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:24.070
He was probably correct.

00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:26.770
Another interesting
person working on this

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:28.300
is Joseph Rotblat.

00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:30.860
So he quit Los
Alamos after the--

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.310
not after the war
that should say--

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:35.770
after Germany was defeated,
because he thought that there

00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:38.570
was no purpose to continue
to study the bomb,

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.310
if that was their goal was to
have the bomb before Germany

00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:43.360
did, to protect themselves.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:45.790
He didn't think that
developing the bomb further

00:46:45.790 --> 00:46:49.380
was necessary after
Germany was defeated.

00:46:49.380 --> 00:46:51.130
And then both Wilson
and Feynman, I think,

00:46:51.130 --> 00:46:54.680
are quoted again in
that Bennis article.

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:59.740
So when they do the first
successful test at Trinity,

00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:01.120
everyone's out
there celebrating.

00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:03.160
This is the culmination
of all their work,

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.440
so they're really
excited about this.

00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.370
But Feynman sees Robert Wilson,
and he's like desponded.

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.020
It's a terrible
thing that we made.

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:12.730
And Feynman points
out that they all

00:47:12.730 --> 00:47:15.370
got caught up in this
excitement, this enthusiasm

00:47:15.370 --> 00:47:17.980
for achieving their goal,
that they kind of lost sight

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:20.890
of what their goal would do.

00:47:20.890 --> 00:47:24.250
And so that's, I think, a very
important part of the story

00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:26.968
that makes it a little different
from some of the other ones

00:47:26.968 --> 00:47:28.510
that we'll study
today, is that there

00:47:28.510 --> 00:47:32.170
are a lot of potential
downsides to the work

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:35.835
that this great group did.

00:47:35.835 --> 00:47:37.210
I think it's pretty
clear that it

00:47:37.210 --> 00:47:39.100
was great in its
characteristics,

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.410
but I think it'd be
interesting to discuss

00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:43.390
what the repercussions
of that could be.

00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:52.090
So one question before we go
too much into the ethical debate

00:47:52.090 --> 00:47:54.450
about Oppenheimer himself--

00:47:54.450 --> 00:47:55.870
so as I mentioned,
a lot of people

00:47:55.870 --> 00:47:58.180
didn't have much
faith that Oppenheimer

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.680
would be an effective leader.

00:47:59.680 --> 00:48:02.590
And it didn't seem like there
was a little bit of a learning

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:05.140
curve for him to
understand what was

00:48:05.140 --> 00:48:06.900
realistic in what could work.

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.700
And so one question that
came to my mind was,

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:13.000
how long should a trial period
be for a leader in a situation?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:17.020
How do you decide this
person's not cutting it,

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:20.140
we need to replace him,
versus ruling out people

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:22.900
just because they haven't
adapted really quickly?

00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:24.570
So if you have any
thoughts on that--

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:26.810
MAX: Well, I suppose it
depends on the situation.

00:48:26.810 --> 00:48:29.710
But here, if you're
in a war scenario

00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:31.120
where you have a
couple of years,

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.250
and that could be the
difference-- and even

00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:37.210
a couple of months could be
the difference between today

00:48:37.210 --> 00:48:39.601
and Man in the High Castle.

00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:44.500
For those who don't know,
it's an alternate universe

00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.900
where Nazi Germany wins.

00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:53.320
So I guess in that case, I would
have given him like two months

00:48:53.320 --> 00:48:57.940
to figure out can he change,
is showing improvement?

00:48:57.940 --> 00:49:01.810
If he isn't ideally
suited at the beginning,

00:49:01.810 --> 00:49:05.570
can he adapt to the situation?

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:08.160
And even then even,
if he can adapt,

00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:10.988
can adapt quickly enough--

00:49:10.988 --> 00:49:13.280
AUDIENCE: Could I ask-- who
would conduct a performance

00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.940
review?

00:49:15.940 --> 00:49:18.830
BETH: In this situation,
he was kind of subject

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.540
to the Army's approval, as well.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.180
He was working kind of paired
up with General Groves,

00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:25.250
so I think that he would
have had a lot of say,

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:27.375
if he thought Oppenheimer
was doing a terrible job.

00:49:27.375 --> 00:49:30.095
But as far as who his
ultimate boss was--

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:34.490
MAX: [INAUDIBLE] I'd
say some of his other--

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:36.860
his subordinates
would also definitely

00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.450
have some weight because then--

00:49:38.450 --> 00:49:40.850
they're all very accomplished
scientists in their field,

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:44.490
so their opinions
certainly have meaning.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:46.307
So I think, if they
worked with Groves,

00:49:46.307 --> 00:49:48.890
they could-- if they wanted to,
they could get him pushed out.

00:49:51.850 --> 00:49:54.280
AUDIENCE: Also going off that
point, I think, as a leader,

00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:57.220
it's really important to
recognize when you might have

00:49:57.220 --> 00:49:59.170
some deficiencies,
and really learn how

00:49:59.170 --> 00:50:02.500
to delegate to other people.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.840
In the beginning, I think
the article mentioned

00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:09.190
he wasn't very good at
budgeting things or managing

00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:11.310
the logistics of
establishing the town.

00:50:11.310 --> 00:50:14.110
So maybe if he could
recognize really early on,

00:50:14.110 --> 00:50:17.090
oh, I can't do this, I need to
appoint someone else to do it,

00:50:17.090 --> 00:50:20.460
I think that's also an important
part of being a good leader.

00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:23.110
And to be honest,
it's something that

00:50:23.110 --> 00:50:26.740
probably should be established
early on, especially in such

00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:30.080
a time-sensitive project.

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:33.430
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: That's just
a thought to contribute here

00:50:33.430 --> 00:50:36.850
on his leadership style.

00:50:36.850 --> 00:50:39.530
Martin brought us through
Edison, and in some ways,

00:50:39.530 --> 00:50:43.780
Edison is a 19th century
figure with a certain kind of--

00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:46.360
who believes in
his own seniority,

00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.080
his own kind of authority.

00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.800
And he's something of
an authoritarian figure

00:50:50.800 --> 00:50:51.730
with that community.

00:50:51.730 --> 00:50:54.670
They do share things and
they are all up late at night

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:56.560
together, but there's
no questioning

00:50:56.560 --> 00:50:58.310
about who the leader is.

00:50:58.310 --> 00:51:00.910
Oppenheimer's got a very
different leadership style.

00:51:00.910 --> 00:51:03.640
And correct me, Beth, if you've
got a different view on this.

00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:10.730
But there was a phrase in
the book reading about him,

00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:13.470
which was, he was like
a bee spreading pollen.

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:17.260
In the words, he had the ability
to go from group to group

00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:20.590
to group-- because this is
organized with teams working

00:51:20.590 --> 00:51:24.270
on particular parts
of the project--

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:26.380
help them think of
their core ideas,

00:51:26.380 --> 00:51:28.510
and then share ideas
other groups that

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:30.222
would help influence them.

00:51:30.222 --> 00:51:32.430
And I think that turned out
to be a really critical--

00:51:32.430 --> 00:51:33.640
this is a large operation.

00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.120
This is not going
to fit in one room.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.750
Now, he did, as you
mentioned, Beth,

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:39.820
pull them together
into the auditorium

00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:43.530
weekly for really in-depth
exchanges and presentations

00:51:43.530 --> 00:51:45.530
so that they all kind of
knew what was going on,

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:48.610
they were all in on
what was happening.

00:51:48.610 --> 00:51:52.400
But he plays a critical role
in moving from team to team,

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.580
trading the ideas
back and forth that

00:51:54.580 --> 00:51:57.040
will help move them along
and help advance them.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.220
And in some ways, that's
the critical function

00:52:00.220 --> 00:52:01.910
that I think he plays.

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.540
Does that add up
with your views?

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:04.150
BETH: Yeah.

00:52:04.150 --> 00:52:06.490
I was thinking of one
other point in the book

00:52:06.490 --> 00:52:08.200
where it said his
talent was finding

00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:11.870
the talents of other people
and using those effectively.

00:52:11.870 --> 00:52:12.370
So yeah.

00:52:12.370 --> 00:52:13.570
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:16.780
So that's a different
leadership model,

00:52:16.780 --> 00:52:19.210
but in this setting, an
absolutely critical one,

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.710
I think.

00:52:20.710 --> 00:52:23.830
Because all of these pieces
have to work together,

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:25.840
and unless they're
all advancing,

00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:27.760
it's not going to happen.

00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.710
And he plays a
really critical role

00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:35.210
in getting those pieces
advancing together.

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:37.570
BETH: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:37.570 --> 00:52:39.370
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:41.860
BETH: So again,
going back to what

00:52:41.860 --> 00:52:45.550
Bennis talked about with
these great groups that

00:52:45.550 --> 00:52:51.040
may be towing a dangerous line.

00:52:51.040 --> 00:52:54.910
How could one stop the
seemingly runaway tendency

00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:56.620
of great groups that
they start crossing

00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:58.330
an ethical or moral line?

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:01.750
It seems like they have
so much momentum going.

00:53:01.750 --> 00:53:04.700
What responsibility do
the scientists within

00:53:04.700 --> 00:53:06.790
have-- or anyone within
it, not scientists--

00:53:06.790 --> 00:53:09.190
to slow it down and rethink it?

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:12.795
How would you go
about doing that?

00:53:12.795 --> 00:53:15.220
AUDIENCE: Well, I
almost think it's

00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:19.805
in the eye of the beholder,
because this one is pretty--

00:53:19.805 --> 00:53:22.180
well, even this is murky--
but it's pretty cut and dried.

00:53:22.180 --> 00:53:25.690
They made it a huge
killing device.

00:53:25.690 --> 00:53:30.340
But I'm presenting on Craig
Venter and the decoding

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.680
of the human genome,
and a lot of people

00:53:32.680 --> 00:53:37.850
might argue that that is an
out-of-control topic, as well.

00:53:37.850 --> 00:53:40.040
So I think it's kind
of your perspective

00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:41.890
that you're coming from.

00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:46.657
MARTIN: I think also, we--

00:53:46.657 --> 00:53:48.490
especially in this
presentation, you kind of

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:50.020
glanced over Heisenberg.

00:53:50.020 --> 00:53:51.648
So it wasn't just,
we're building a gun

00:53:51.648 --> 00:53:52.690
so we can shoot somebody.

00:53:52.690 --> 00:53:53.980
It's like, somebody
else is building gun

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:54.940
and they're about
to shoot us, and we

00:53:54.940 --> 00:53:57.315
should be the-- we need to be
the first ones to be ready.

00:53:57.315 --> 00:53:59.260
Because Heisenberg
seemed way more prepared.

00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:00.700
They were getting reports.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.160
There's this great documentary
called "Oppenheimer vs

00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:06.100
Heisenberg" by American
Genius where they go over

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.950
how they thought Heisenberg
was much farther ahead,

00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:11.560
and sometimes they would fake
reports to make it seem--

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.210
so for them, yeah, there
were these ethical questions.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:16.210
And the interesting thing
about this great group

00:54:16.210 --> 00:54:18.880
is that most the people that
joined the group were very much

00:54:18.880 --> 00:54:20.920
pacifists or left.

00:54:20.920 --> 00:54:23.860
So they weren't people who
wanted to build weapons.

00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:26.680
But at this time period,
the stresses around

00:54:26.680 --> 00:54:29.530
them influence them to have
to build this because they

00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:30.550
knew that, if they--

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:34.287
even though my beliefs are
this, if I don't do this,

00:54:34.287 --> 00:54:36.120
it could affect people
that I do care about.

00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.620
And it's just because
of my beliefs,

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:39.858
so maybe I should change
my beliefs to do this.

00:54:39.858 --> 00:54:42.400
I think the ethical question
was very much after they figured

00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.940
out Heisenberg wasn't--

00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:48.580
his lab had already blown up
and it wasn't working out.

00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:49.603
Why didn't they stop?

00:54:49.603 --> 00:54:51.770
And a lot of it is that
they already had come into--

00:54:51.770 --> 00:54:54.760
they had so much momentum that
they wanted to be prepared.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:59.753
But also how are you
defining a horrible weapon?

00:54:59.753 --> 00:55:01.420
It's a weapon that
can take down cities,

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:03.128
and how many times
had it ultimately been

00:55:03.128 --> 00:55:04.870
used since the time period?

00:55:04.870 --> 00:55:07.720
And how many deaths have been
created because of it compared

00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:10.060
to other things too?

00:55:10.060 --> 00:55:12.430
I think there's a
huge focus on it

00:55:12.430 --> 00:55:14.730
because it's a weapon
of high magnitude,

00:55:14.730 --> 00:55:16.283
so it's under a higher scrutiny.

00:55:16.283 --> 00:55:18.700
But also I'd want to look into
the data of how many people

00:55:18.700 --> 00:55:20.450
have actually being
killed by nuclear arms

00:55:20.450 --> 00:55:21.420
compared to other--

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.880
AUDIENCE: Or it can be a
weapon or a source of energy.

00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:28.480
The human genome can be a
source of biological weaponry

00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.777
or a huge source of
knowledge for science.

00:55:30.777 --> 00:55:32.860
So you have these caveats
with a lot of the things

00:55:32.860 --> 00:55:34.540
that the great groups have done.

00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.580
MAX: That's kind of
the point of science.

00:55:36.580 --> 00:55:38.230
Science is morally neutral.

00:55:38.230 --> 00:55:40.270
You're just learning
about the nature of atoms,

00:55:40.270 --> 00:55:44.440
the nature of nuclei, and what
kind of chain reaction exists.

00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.690
That just depends on the
people that actually have it,

00:55:46.690 --> 00:55:48.107
and who discovers
it, and how they

00:55:48.107 --> 00:55:49.880
decide to fund it and use it.

00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:53.523
So that's going to happen with
any technology that exists.

00:55:53.523 --> 00:55:54.940
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
But Max, we're

00:55:54.940 --> 00:56:00.340
moving here from science to a
very clear, specific technology

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.390
project.

00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:05.800
But I think, Martin, you
make an important point.

00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:08.020
This physics community
before World War II

00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.720
is a relatively small community,
and the group that gets

00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:13.720
assembled here, they
all know each other.

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:16.930
They've all been in
communication prior to the war.

00:56:16.930 --> 00:56:20.490
And they knew
Heisenberg very well,

00:56:20.490 --> 00:56:24.120
and they knew how
unbelievably talented he was.

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:28.050
And they thought he had at least
a couple of years head start.

00:56:28.050 --> 00:56:31.320
And I think they all
realized that if Heisenberg

00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:33.610
was successful in doing this--

00:56:33.610 --> 00:56:37.880
we talked about the Rad Lab
as a war-winning technology--

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:39.420
radar.

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:42.393
This is war-ending.

00:56:42.393 --> 00:56:44.060
If Germany developed
this first, the war

00:56:44.060 --> 00:56:46.520
would be over like that.

00:56:46.520 --> 00:56:47.900
It would be over.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.780
And now is an option which
I think the group certainly,

00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:55.160
as a whole, felt was
completely unacceptable.

00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:59.390
So that motivates
everything up until April.

00:56:59.390 --> 00:57:00.920
And then what's going to happen?

00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.320
So that's a critical
moment, but it's not

00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:10.190
really until after the
actual use of the weapon

00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:14.060
that I think this community
begins to think hard about this

00:57:14.060 --> 00:57:16.170
and about the consequences.

00:57:16.170 --> 00:57:18.320
There are some
exceptions, like Rothblat.

00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:22.880
But that's when
Oppenheimer has to confront

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.930
what the implications are and
begin to think about how to--

00:57:26.930 --> 00:57:30.150
because they've all been
involved in development of it.

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:31.800
The physics community
comes together

00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:35.515
as a political body, in a way,
and starts to try and push

00:57:35.515 --> 00:57:37.140
the government to
think about how we're

00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:40.440
going to deal with these
staggering technologies

00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:43.980
and their implications.

00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:45.360
Does that add up, Beth?

00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.240
BETH: Yeah.

00:57:46.240 --> 00:57:47.137
It does.

00:57:47.137 --> 00:57:48.720
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Do want to give us

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.345
some closing thoughts
about Oppenheimer

00:57:50.345 --> 00:57:52.055
and what's important
about the group?

00:57:52.055 --> 00:57:54.180
BETH: Sure.

00:57:54.180 --> 00:57:57.650
So Oppenheimer's
experience is definitely

00:57:57.650 --> 00:58:00.060
quintessential for when--

00:58:00.060 --> 00:58:02.280
for how effective
technology advancements

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:04.230
can be under more pressures.

00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:06.180
So I think we discussed
a few weeks ago,

00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:08.700
is it possible to replicate
this sense of urgency

00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:13.590
and this progress
under times of peace?

00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:17.760
And if we had a Los
Alamos of fusion,

00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.730
would we be able
to get it to work?

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.140
Would we ever be
able to even get

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:24.840
funding to do that without
some kind of wartime need?

00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.965
It's definitely something
I've been thinking about.

00:58:26.965 --> 00:58:29.670
They had so much money, so
many resources, and so much

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:32.190
talent in a small
area, working hard,

00:58:32.190 --> 00:58:33.900
and they were able
to achieve something.

00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:36.900
But again, it was mostly
motivated-- pretty much

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:38.970
entirely motivated by the war.

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:41.100
And I think we just
keep coming back to

00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:43.440
how can we make these
advancements when we

00:58:43.440 --> 00:58:44.990
don't have that same impetus?

00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:49.420
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.520
Good point to close on.

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.860
AUDIENCE: So today
I'm going to present

00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:56.840
on the several groups
that get involved

00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:02.490
in the process of inventing
interactive computers.

00:59:02.490 --> 00:59:06.850
So in the very beginning,
when the first computer

00:59:06.850 --> 00:59:12.020
was invented, it was so big,
expensive, and only accessible

00:59:12.020 --> 00:59:16.700
to scientists and
engineers that there's

00:59:16.700 --> 00:59:21.020
no one that ever imagined
something like this before us

00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:22.790
will be so much--

00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:30.290
no one imagined we would be so
much relying on these devices.

00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:33.660
But then Vannevar
Bush was the one--

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:36.230
had this mission
that computer can

00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:42.230
be some kind of intimate
supplement to memory,

00:59:42.230 --> 00:59:46.220
that he named as
[INAUDIBLE] vision.

00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:51.640
And he presented it in
front of all the scientists

00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:58.130
at the summit and he kind of
inspired one of the scientists

00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:02.575
in Philippines named
Douglas Engelbart.

01:00:02.575 --> 01:00:04.242
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yes, Doug Engelbart.

01:00:04.242 --> 01:00:04.465
AUDIENCE: Engelbart.

01:00:04.465 --> 01:00:05.548
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:00:05.548 --> 01:00:07.970
AUDIENCE: And they
got funding from NASA,

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:13.640
and they started to
get hands on images

01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:18.350
on how to have this
interactivity between computer

01:00:18.350 --> 01:00:19.790
and the users.

01:00:19.790 --> 01:00:25.520
Then the invention of Windows,
and the mouse, and the screen

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:32.780
was successful by 1968.

01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:37.755
Bob Taylor and Alan
Kay had this group

01:00:37.755 --> 01:00:40.590
at Palo Alto Research Center.

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.430
They were under the ax--

01:00:46.585 --> 01:00:47.960
I don't know how
to pronounce it.

01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.040
AUDIENCE: Xerox?

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:50.630
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Xerox, yes.

01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:51.547
AUDIENCE: Xerox, yeah.

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:57.110
Xerox a corporation
with already having

01:00:57.110 --> 01:01:01.340
a lot of scientific investment.

01:01:01.340 --> 01:01:07.580
So PARC, P-A-R-C,
was under Xerox,

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:12.260
and today we're going to focus
on their principles on [their

01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:14.270
recruitment of this great group.

01:01:16.910 --> 01:01:19.360
So Bob Taylor had--

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:26.480
was the real boss of PARC
lab and the principal

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:30.230
that he was is existing
on is that there's

01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:33.860
no good scientists--
there's only great ones.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:41.720
So he had very strict selection
of scientists and participants.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:46.100
The way that he built
this team bonding--

01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:49.820
team spirit is that, during
the selection of scientists,

01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:51.900
he also requests participants--

01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:56.660
the applicants to present
in front of the whole staff,

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:59.820
so people who are already
part of this group

01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:01.640
will find oh, this is
an interesting person

01:02:01.640 --> 01:02:04.520
and we would like to
have him in our team.

01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:08.820
And so whoever get
assigned in this team

01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:11.340
would feel this
sense of recognition.

01:02:11.340 --> 01:02:14.780
And I think this
is something that

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:18.620
might be lacking in a
lot of science groups

01:02:18.620 --> 01:02:22.370
today because there's
always this fear of having

01:02:22.370 --> 01:02:24.590
new members coming
in, and they're

01:02:24.590 --> 01:02:29.750
so talented that they will
replace the previous members.

01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:32.990
And this kind of
fear might hinder

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:35.190
the next round of innovation.

01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:38.990
And the other
principle that Taylor

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:42.740
has the mobility of talents.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:47.210
He introduced market mechanism
where they are now selecting

01:02:47.210 --> 01:02:51.040
projects, but they're--

01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.420
they're not selecting
the talents,

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:55.120
but they're selecting
the projects

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.200
where, in a sense,
whoever finds this project

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.780
interesting can drop
whatever they're doing

01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:01.730
and join the other product.

01:03:01.730 --> 01:03:05.840
So the interesting projects get
more talent and get moved on,

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.240
and those less interesting
ones you get [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:11.240 --> 01:03:16.250
And another key
feature of his team

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:18.740
is that the structure of
the team was also flat.

01:03:18.740 --> 01:03:24.024
There's no influence of politics
in this group of science.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:37.120
Another feature they had is
this group meeting every week.

01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:38.950
So it is the only
compulsory thing,

01:03:38.950 --> 01:03:46.750
that you have to attend
this kind of weekly meeting

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:50.740
where you bring your beanbags
and every project will present

01:03:50.740 --> 01:03:52.360
their recent discoveries.

01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:57.280
And some of the lessons
learned in one project

01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:03.130
might be crucial to the things
going on in another team.

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:07.110
And they exchange these
ideas, and really helped

01:04:07.110 --> 01:04:09.330
the entire lab to develop.

01:04:16.110 --> 01:04:17.470
That is the beanbags.

01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:27.300
Just I will mention
the role of the leader,

01:04:27.300 --> 01:04:32.880
and how good he can serve the
group of talents in his team

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:34.800
and be loyal to--

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.170
be responsible to
the needs of the team

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:39.360
is also very important.

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.510
For PARC, there's
a time that they

01:04:42.510 --> 01:04:53.190
wanted to have access to
different hardwares where the--

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:55.128
Xerox--

01:04:55.128 --> 01:04:56.170
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN Xerox.

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:56.750
AUDIENCE: Xerox--

01:04:56.750 --> 01:04:58.042
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Xerox, yes.

01:04:58.042 --> 01:05:03.920
AUDIENCE: --didn't really
wanted to give the permission,

01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:11.370
bit the leader was very
assertive his demand,

01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:14.110
and really threaten
if you didn't allow--

01:05:14.110 --> 01:05:16.050
if you don't allow us to have--

01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:19.860
to invent our own
hardwares, I will just quit.

01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.810
And eventually,
they get permission

01:05:21.810 --> 01:05:25.290
and they design their own
hardwares and softwares.

01:05:25.290 --> 01:05:30.740
And of course, this team was--

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:32.520
they're group of
scientists that's

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:35.010
really into whatever
they're doing,

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:37.170
that they don't
see how they want

01:05:37.170 --> 01:05:39.955
to ship this to the mainland.

01:05:39.955 --> 01:05:42.360
They don't see how this can be--

01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.930
should be commercialized.

01:05:44.930 --> 01:05:51.170
Therefore, some other team
picked up this really well,

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:55.650
and it's Apple, Steve Jobs.

01:05:55.650 --> 01:06:00.040
So Steve Jobs saw
this opportunity

01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:06.615
of having this
interactive and easy,

01:06:06.615 --> 01:06:12.490
the user-friendly version of
computer being commercialized

01:06:12.490 --> 01:06:13.180
in the market.

01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:19.050
And he understand that that
is the future of computing,

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:29.130
and inspired his team to just
do this in a very [INAUDIBLE]

01:06:29.130 --> 01:06:36.050
So Steve Jobs was able to
inspire his team that they're--

01:06:36.050 --> 01:06:38.340
in a way that they are
doing something secretive.

01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.010
They cannot tell anyone
else what they are doing.

01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:44.690
And they were working
like 100 hours per week

01:06:44.690 --> 01:06:47.870
that's really intense,
and also escalated.

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:59.790
He also has this obsession,
the elegance of this design.

01:06:59.790 --> 01:07:04.110
I think that also explains
how Apple users are

01:07:04.110 --> 01:07:07.180
so loyal to this company.

01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:12.480
Then there's this also
saying that Steve Jobs

01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:16.860
criticism to his employer
sometimes can be abusive.

01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:23.970
And maybe it helped to build
this innovative environment

01:07:23.970 --> 01:07:27.060
and give the pressure to get
things done, but in a way

01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.847
that maybe he's also
driving people away.

01:07:38.950 --> 01:07:45.200
So there's the downsides of
his management principles,

01:07:45.200 --> 01:07:47.210
also this breaking
down of marriage

01:07:47.210 --> 01:07:49.130
and other relationships.

01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:58.280
It can be argued that
maybe this personality also

01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:05.370
helped to get this delivery
of Macintosh to the market.

01:08:05.370 --> 01:08:08.630
But I would like
to hear your voice.

01:08:08.630 --> 01:08:13.060
And there's some
question that's really--

01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:16.340
that's been popping
up in my mind

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.500
while I was doing
these readings.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:19.520
What is your view?

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:27.140
Are some inventions or
technical advancements that--

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:32.660
they are inevitable
for human revolution?

01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:38.390
Maybe the invention of fire
or the use of tools in hunting

01:08:38.390 --> 01:08:42.140
are so crucial to human survival
that they will eventually

01:08:42.140 --> 01:08:44.109
be discovered.

01:08:44.109 --> 01:08:47.479
But there are other things like
maybe the desired computer.

01:08:47.479 --> 01:08:52.069
Maybe Vannevar Bush
didn't point or have

01:08:52.069 --> 01:08:54.890
this vision of
personal computer,

01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:58.670
but it's something entirely
different, but equally amazing.

01:08:58.670 --> 01:09:01.160
Maybe we are having an
entirely different way

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:05.510
of communicating and
transporting everything,

01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:07.310
but so much different.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:13.010
So do you think there are
this category of innovations

01:09:13.010 --> 01:09:18.350
that some of them are
crucial and inevitable,

01:09:18.350 --> 01:09:21.859
there are other things
that are still--

01:09:21.859 --> 01:09:24.380
we can still be without?

01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:27.800
What are your thoughts?

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.810
MAX: So thinking back--

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:33.050
I think this goes back to
the previous reading that

01:09:33.050 --> 01:09:35.000
was talking about how--

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.840
the 10,000 hours thing.

01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.060
So a lot of inventions,
they seem to come by chance,

01:09:41.060 --> 01:09:43.580
but they're not
actually by chance.

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:47.090
They come from people dedicating
thousands and thousands

01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:51.620
of hours and years, and
completely restructuring

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.800
their very lives just
so they can try to make

01:09:54.800 --> 01:09:57.080
some sort of development.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:02.060
So I guess my first-- the
first example comes to mind

01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:03.470
is penicillin.

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:07.520
Everyone's heard the story of
how he accidentally made it

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.010
and how he actually found
out that it works, because he

01:10:10.010 --> 01:10:13.070
spilled some on a sandwich that
had mold on it or something.

01:10:13.070 --> 01:10:15.530
That's the story I heard anyway.

01:10:15.530 --> 01:10:20.320
So sometimes, maybe
occasionally chance

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:26.140
will help us find the invention
or hear about it more quickly.

01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:28.270
For example, what's his
face-- who made the phone?

01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:31.435
Graham Bell, thank you.

01:10:31.435 --> 01:10:32.329
MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE]

01:10:32.329 --> 01:10:32.996
MAX: Yeah, yeah.

01:10:36.130 --> 01:10:39.425
Actually, apparently, he
was at the World Fair.

01:10:39.425 --> 01:10:41.050
This is actually a
story I really love.

01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:43.490
He was at the World's
Fair, and he--

01:10:43.490 --> 01:10:46.450
when he was there, he happened
to get there really late,

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:50.230
so he couldn't get a table
in the electrical section.

01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:52.840
So he had to get into some
sort of botany section

01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:56.140
that was in this
musky attic somewhere.

01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:59.740
And no one ever actually
saw his project,

01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:01.270
because it was out of the way.

01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:05.080
And apparently there
was a guy, some prince.

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:09.670
And Graham Bell used to teach
at a school for the deaf,

01:11:09.670 --> 01:11:12.450
because I think his father
was deaf or something.

01:11:15.130 --> 01:11:17.710
This prince was the one who
was leading the judges around

01:11:17.710 --> 01:11:18.685
at the World's Fair.

01:11:22.307 --> 01:11:24.140
The judges were tired
at the end of the day,

01:11:24.140 --> 01:11:25.870
and they decided, OK, we'll
look at one more project

01:11:25.870 --> 01:11:26.770
and go home.

01:11:26.770 --> 01:11:29.320
And the prince happened
to see Bell, and they--

01:11:29.320 --> 01:11:31.900
the prince obviously,
he greeted Bell.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:34.600
He was like, oh, yeah, it's
great to see you again.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:36.700
And then Bell showed
off his invention,

01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:38.270
and the rest is history.

01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:42.040
So sometimes it's chance,
but I feel like chance--

01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:46.210
the invention isn't necessarily
chance, but rather the--

01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:49.345
its rapid development
and commercialization,

01:11:49.345 --> 01:11:50.470
that might be a little bit.

01:11:55.350 --> 01:11:58.250
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Let me draw
on some of the things, Luyao,

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:01.220
that you raised, and tie it
back to Max for a second.

01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:06.250
So let me just go through some
of your interesting points

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:08.420
with some additional
perspectives.

01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:11.590
So one, the point
you started with

01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:14.200
was the Memex and
Vannever Bush's role

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.770
in creating the Memex, which
was really a fast retrieval

01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:22.340
system for it microfilm
knowledge bases.

01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:26.570
We could look at it now and
think about Windows and search

01:12:26.570 --> 01:12:30.500
engines as derivative
technologies,

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:34.670
but that's really what
he was driving at.

01:12:34.670 --> 01:12:37.580
And so it put a
picture up of something

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:40.520
that computing might be
able to undertake for us.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:43.070
It's not that he was
able to achieve it.

01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:45.020
So that was, I think, a
very interesting point

01:12:45.020 --> 01:12:48.410
to start from.

01:12:48.410 --> 01:12:50.810
Then you took us through
the story of Doug Engelbart,

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:51.380
just briefly.

01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:56.480
We talked last week about--

01:12:56.480 --> 01:12:58.040
and we'll talk more--

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:01.610
about JCR Licklider and the
role of DARPA in creating

01:13:01.610 --> 01:13:05.240
these great group communities.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.750
Engelbart is at Stanford
Research Institute, SRI,

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:11.050
and Licklider funds him.

01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:15.080
And Engelbart is clearly
a remarkable talent.

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.010
Licklider has the ability at
DARPA to pick great groups

01:13:18.010 --> 01:13:21.130
and support them, and Engelbart
is one that he comes up with.

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:23.140
SRI couldn't understand
what he was doing.

01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.310
They were pretty dismissive.

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:27.160
But Licklider understood
back at the DARPA office,

01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:28.810
and kept him funded.

01:13:28.810 --> 01:13:30.790
So he does a demonstration,
as you point out,

01:13:30.790 --> 01:13:34.060
of 1968, which is called
the mother of all demos.

01:13:34.060 --> 01:13:39.010
And it was to a group of
computer freaks and computer

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:41.470
scientists.

01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:43.270
And they're all
gathered in a room,

01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:47.140
and Engelbart runs this series
of demonstrations about what

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:51.790
computing is going to be able
to do, and shows hypertext,

01:13:51.790 --> 01:13:57.490
and he shows the mouse, and
he shows just a whole set

01:13:57.490 --> 01:13:59.127
of capabilities
that computing is

01:13:59.127 --> 01:14:01.210
going to be able to lead
to-- which none have ever

01:14:01.210 --> 01:14:02.590
seen compiled before.

01:14:02.590 --> 01:14:06.200
So that was a critical
visualization moment.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.440
Bob Taylor also
worked for Licklider.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:11.110
So he was a project
manager in DARPA--

01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:13.660
again, another one of the
talents that Licklider

01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:14.590
identified.

01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:19.120
And Taylor goes
out to Xerox PARC

01:14:19.120 --> 01:14:22.120
and is running what we would
call the personal computing

01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.140
team.

01:14:23.140 --> 01:14:25.540
And they develop--

01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:29.320
Luyao, would you go to the
slide of the early Apple,

01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:31.480
the early Mac?

01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:32.560
Yeah, that one.

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:38.470
They develop something called
the Alto at Xerox PARC.

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:40.730
It does look a fair
amount like this.

01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:41.980
It's got a cathode ray screen.

01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:43.465
It's got a computer keyboard.

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:49.760
But it has all
these capabilities

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.920
that, in some ways, they have--

01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:57.470
it has all of Engelbart's
capabilities and more--

01:14:57.470 --> 01:15:00.860
and remarkable ability
to do data visualization.

01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:03.190
It's fun to use, it's--

01:15:03.190 --> 01:15:05.180
there having a
great time with it.

01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:09.470
But because, as you pointed out,
of this island-bridge problem--

01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:14.823
in other words, Xerox PARC
Palo Alto Research Center

01:15:14.823 --> 01:15:15.990
is out there in California--

01:15:15.990 --> 01:15:19.050
Xerox is in Rochester, New York.

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:22.390
It's making copying machines.

01:15:22.390 --> 01:15:24.910
There just is no
connection between--

01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:29.270
as you suggested, between
the group making copiers

01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:35.650
in New York and these wild
computer scientists living

01:15:35.650 --> 01:15:37.420
on beanbags.

01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:40.230
And they just don't--
it doesn't happen.

01:15:40.230 --> 01:15:41.980
The technology doesn't transfer.

01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:46.540
Xerox has no idea
really what these--

01:15:46.540 --> 01:15:50.140
what this incredible Xerox
PARC team visualized here

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:50.860
has accomplished.

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.660
They don't know how to
translate it in the marketplace,

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:58.450
so they miss the opportunity
of being Apple, and therefore,

01:15:58.450 --> 01:16:00.530
the largest company in
the world at the moment.

01:16:00.530 --> 01:16:03.250
So it's a painful
island-bridge problem

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:06.280
that they are never
able to resolve.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.980
The head of R&D at Xerox PARC--

01:16:08.980 --> 01:16:13.060
at Xerox, who had set up
Xerox PARC to begin with,

01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:16.390
isn't able to help them
make that transition.

01:16:16.390 --> 01:16:22.000
So it's the ultimate story of
the island-bridge not working.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:27.590
And then, just to kind of carry
this story through, it's--

01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:30.920
Jobs buys the rights
to essentially walk

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:35.330
through Xerox PARC,
and see the Alto,

01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:37.340
and see what it's accomplished.

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:40.610
And he and his team go through
in the course of the afternoon.

01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:42.440
It's not that they
take the technology.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:45.170
They don't get the rights
to take the technology.

01:16:45.170 --> 01:16:50.760
What they do is see what the
Alto is capable of doing.

01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:54.210
And then they have a
picture of what's possible,

01:16:54.210 --> 01:16:57.300
and then they work on
putting the Mac together

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:58.682
to realize that picture.

01:16:58.682 --> 01:17:00.390
So there's great
technical accomplishment

01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:02.160
and what they achieve.

01:17:02.160 --> 01:17:06.580
But they do get the visions
on what gets put together.

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:10.830
So Luyao has led us in
this interesting track

01:17:10.830 --> 01:17:17.520
of Vannevar Bush and Memex
to Doug Engelbart to--

01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.250
I would throw in DARPA here
because they played such role--

01:17:20.250 --> 01:17:24.900
but then to Bob Taylor comes
out of DARPA to lead Xerox PARC,

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:26.340
and then to Steve Jobs.

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.690
So there's a whole continuity.

01:17:27.690 --> 01:17:29.040
And there's something
worth remembering,

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.415
which is that all
of these groups

01:17:30.415 --> 01:17:33.600
stand on each other's shoulders.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.640
These incredible
technology achievements

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:39.550
that lead to personal computing
just build, build, build,

01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:40.050
and build.

01:17:40.050 --> 01:17:42.600
And there's a series of
remarkable great groups here.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:44.960
Is that a fair summary?

01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:47.967
OK, now, let's
get back to your--

01:17:47.967 --> 01:17:49.550
let me come to you
in a second, Steph.

01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:52.790
But I think Luyao's question
is a really key one, that there

01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:58.670
are inventions that
we have to have,

01:17:58.670 --> 01:18:01.790
and then there's other stuff.

01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:08.870
And how do we create that drive
to create the other stuff,

01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:09.700
like computing?

01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:11.450
We didn't have to have
personal computing.

01:18:11.450 --> 01:18:15.560
The world got along with it for
a few million years without it.

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:19.823
What is it enables us to put
that on the list as a necessity

01:18:19.823 --> 01:18:20.990
and really drive towards it?

01:18:20.990 --> 01:18:22.210
How does that happen?

01:18:22.210 --> 01:18:24.510
Is that a fair summary
of your question?

01:18:24.510 --> 01:18:25.010
OK.

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:31.000
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I think that's

01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:32.917
where I disagree with
Max-- that I don't think

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.480
it's so much about
an inevitability,

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.430
because I think it's much more
about what Bill just stated,

01:18:36.430 --> 01:18:38.260
that we stand on the
shoulders of giants,

01:18:38.260 --> 01:18:41.440
and that necessitates
the continuance

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.175
of a momentum toward a
direction of something.

01:18:44.175 --> 01:18:45.550
And I feel like
we had been going

01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:48.010
towards the direction of the
personal computer for a very

01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:51.860
long time, beginning
with the Gutenberg press,

01:18:51.860 --> 01:18:55.330
and then the personal typewriter
that you could carry around,

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:57.240
and that people certainly
did carry around.

01:18:57.240 --> 01:18:59.080
And then that gave
people the impression

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.580
that there could
be something better

01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:02.470
and that there was a next step.

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:06.590
So I don't think it's so
much about inevitability or--

01:19:06.590 --> 01:19:10.202
and I do think sometimes
chance does play a role,

01:19:10.202 --> 01:19:12.160
but I think it's more so
about the continuation

01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.480
of that momentum.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.580
And that's why I think
it's important to analyze

01:19:15.580 --> 01:19:17.980
where we are and where
we've been going,

01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:20.800
and to think about the
interesting visions

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:24.610
that we can have within the
confines of that direction

01:19:24.610 --> 01:19:26.110
in which we're
moving forward to.

01:19:28.293 --> 01:19:29.710
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
So in a way, I

01:19:29.710 --> 01:19:32.810
think what you're
both saying is that--

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:34.830
and we'll tie it back
into Beth's discussion

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:37.010
of Oppenheimer--

01:19:37.010 --> 01:19:41.130
you build up this momentum
on a technology pathway,

01:19:41.130 --> 01:19:43.080
and you can't turn
back the clock.

01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:46.350
And that's what
Oppenheimer found.

01:19:46.350 --> 01:19:48.090
When that project
reached culmination,

01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:50.130
he probably wanted to
turn back the clock,

01:19:50.130 --> 01:19:51.300
but there was no way.

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.192
That technology would
keep going on a pathway.

01:19:54.192 --> 01:19:56.275
And maybe that's a way of
answering your question,

01:19:56.275 --> 01:19:58.680
Luyao, that there's
certain-- there becomes

01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.680
a certain inevitability about,
once you start launching down

01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.270
a technology pathway,
that it's going

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:08.040
to have its own momentum,
whether it's a necessity

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:09.340
or not.

01:20:09.340 --> 01:20:12.070
What do you think?

01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:14.170
AUDIENCE: I think this is
getting philosophical--

01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:20.480
whether or not there's
alternatives to history.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:26.320
I realize there's another
part I didn't touch.

01:20:26.320 --> 01:20:29.980
So this-- a lot of
principles we introduced

01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:34.240
in these great groups
doesn't really act as models.

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:36.730
It's just these
factors adding together

01:20:36.730 --> 01:20:38.050
make these things successful.

01:20:38.050 --> 01:20:45.220
But how applicable are these
principles to the world today?

01:20:45.220 --> 01:20:48.070
Personally, I find there's
over-commercialization

01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:52.060
of a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] inventions.

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:53.740
And I don't know if it's true.

01:20:57.150 --> 01:21:01.320
Also I saw a question
in our summary asking

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:07.350
with these lessons learned
from previous great groups,

01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:10.320
how can these lessons be
applied to different scales

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:14.520
of production?

01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.540
The great groups I assessed
are smaller groups,

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:22.190
and they're in the beginning
of figuring out how computer--

01:21:22.190 --> 01:21:23.570
personal computer can work.

01:21:23.570 --> 01:21:28.290
But in terms of bigger companies
like Google or Facebook,

01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:29.560
are they--

01:21:29.560 --> 01:21:33.320
how applicable are these lessons
to these bigger groups that

01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:37.820
also requires innovation, but
having a more complex politics

01:21:37.820 --> 01:21:39.638
in these groups?

01:21:39.638 --> 01:21:40.680
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yeah.

01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.950
Look, I think that's
a crucial question.

01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:48.210
And related to it is, once
you create a great group,

01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:51.300
does it only do
one thing, or can I

01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:55.440
keep moving on to
ongoing innovations?

01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:59.010
And the number of times
that happens is not big.

01:21:59.010 --> 01:22:01.770
But how could you create
a culture, particularly

01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:04.440
within the larger
corporate organization,

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:06.510
that keeps innovating.

01:22:06.510 --> 01:22:09.030
It's really a tricky problem.

01:22:09.030 --> 01:22:11.070
AUDIENCE: We also hope
that these models can

01:22:11.070 --> 01:22:14.040
be independent of the leader
and their personality,

01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:17.190
and can be cated
in other fields.

01:22:17.190 --> 01:22:21.664
Otherwise, it will always
be reliant on that leaders

01:22:21.664 --> 01:22:26.598
to lead us [INAUDIBLE]

01:22:26.598 --> 01:22:28.140
AUDIENCE: So when
I was reading this,

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:32.220
and in Bennis's whole
description of great groups,

01:22:32.220 --> 01:22:34.320
I definitely have
a lot of concerns

01:22:34.320 --> 01:22:35.860
with how the groups come about.

01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:38.460
Like at PARC
especially, it was--

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:39.130
I forget.

01:22:39.130 --> 01:22:40.295
Taylor was his name?

01:22:40.295 --> 01:22:41.170
AUDIENCE: Bob Taylor.

01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:42.462
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Bob Taylor.

01:22:42.462 --> 01:22:45.870
AUDIENCE: He was picking people
whose personalities meshed well

01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:47.790
with the group, and
stuff like that.

01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:49.590
And then Bennis
emphasizes so much

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:52.020
about how great
groups can really

01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:54.840
affect people's family life.

01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:58.460
It seems like they kind of
exclude a lot of people.

01:22:58.460 --> 01:23:00.960
If you don't fit with
the leader of the group,

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.580
even if you could
have contributed,

01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:04.290
you have a different
personality type,

01:23:04.290 --> 01:23:06.300
you might not get picked
to be in a great group.

01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:09.000
Or if you're a woman
who is expected

01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.090
to see her children
once in a while,

01:23:12.090 --> 01:23:14.460
how are you going to
hang in the great group?

01:23:14.460 --> 01:23:15.500
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Sometimes
fathers see their children

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:16.700
occasionally.

01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:19.140
AUDIENCE: I know, but
I think there's still

01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:21.990
a societal expectation of
women being somewhat more

01:23:21.990 --> 01:23:23.710
present in their families--

01:23:23.710 --> 01:23:26.608
whether that will
persist, who knows.

01:23:26.608 --> 01:23:27.150
I don't know.

01:23:27.150 --> 01:23:30.720
It makes me nervous when
we talk about perpetuating

01:23:30.720 --> 01:23:32.190
great groups, when
they seem kind

01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:34.795
of exclusionary, exclusive.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.950
AUDIENCE: There's an amazing
point that you have brought up,

01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:43.740
that I will touch on in a
second, the first one of which

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:45.023
is that I don't think that--

01:23:45.023 --> 01:23:46.440
or rather, your
analysis, I think,

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.900
applies well to the
Tuxedo Park reading

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.720
that we did maybe two or
three classes ago about how--

01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:55.905
what was his name,
Alfred Loomis?

01:23:55.905 --> 01:23:57.030
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Loomis.

01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:58.780
AUDIENCE: Loomis was
hand-selecting people

01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:01.050
that he liked to
work in his lab.

01:24:01.050 --> 01:24:03.810
That doesn't seem
to me to be very far

01:24:03.810 --> 01:24:08.310
from what he was doing in his
private lab, which is obviously

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:10.790
a point of concern, in
terms of including diversity

01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:11.690
in your perspective--

01:24:11.690 --> 01:24:13.190
[INAUDIBLE]
perspectives, not to say

01:24:13.190 --> 01:24:16.200
anything of racial diversity,
and affirmative action right,

01:24:16.200 --> 01:24:20.640
and including populations
that can be underrepresented

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.410
in science and technology.

01:24:22.410 --> 01:24:24.700
But furthermore, also
while I was reading this,

01:24:24.700 --> 01:24:26.300
I felt like it was
almost presupposed

01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:29.220
that all of these people
were going to be white male.

01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:32.508
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: So let's
go back to the beanbag slide.

01:24:32.508 --> 01:24:33.550
AUDIENCE: There's a girl.

01:24:33.550 --> 01:24:35.192
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: There's two.

01:24:35.192 --> 01:24:36.650
AUDIENCE: In the
reading, they only

01:24:36.650 --> 01:24:38.390
mentioned one woman
explicitly, and that

01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:40.740
was the woman who was the
graphic designer at Apple,

01:24:40.740 --> 01:24:42.860
and so she didn't have
any technical capabilities

01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:44.750
and didn't have much
of a role to play

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:46.400
within the
organizational structure.

01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:48.320
And thus, her
influence was very low.

01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:51.110
So I really call into question
precisely what Beth is saying,

01:24:51.110 --> 01:24:53.103
but would almost say
that it's not something

01:24:53.103 --> 01:24:54.020
that makes me nervous.

01:24:54.020 --> 01:24:56.720
It's something I
find outrageous.

01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:00.440
MAX: So I would say actually
to somewhat counter that--

01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.852
definitely I agree,
women in STEM

01:25:02.852 --> 01:25:05.060
fields-- that we definitely
need more representation.

01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:08.090
But it's possible
that, at the time,

01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:11.290
there was less of an
emphasis on STEM education,

01:25:11.290 --> 01:25:12.040
which would mean--

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:12.748
AUDIENCE: Oh, no.

01:25:12.748 --> 01:25:14.420
So I totally agree
with the reasons--

01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:16.837
or rather, I understand the
reasons as to why it happened.

01:25:16.837 --> 01:25:19.640
But as being these
scholars are thinking

01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.620
about organizational
structure, they're

01:25:21.620 --> 01:25:24.140
not adding in any
caveats about the roles

01:25:24.140 --> 01:25:26.900
in which these social
factors have to play.

01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:29.150
And furthermore, they're
not making recommendations

01:25:29.150 --> 01:25:30.740
as to how they
could be resolved.

01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:33.110
Because if they are
not the ones addressing

01:25:33.110 --> 01:25:35.990
these holes within
organizational structure

01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:37.160
and how people can--

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:39.800
people's perspectives can
be meaningfully included,

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:44.450
then you're just glossing
over that as an issue

01:25:44.450 --> 01:25:46.290
and leaving it for
someone else to resolve.

01:25:46.290 --> 01:25:49.310
And so that was my concern with
this reading, in particular.

01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:52.550
I can have a concern writ large
with sexism in the workplace,

01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:55.032
but I try to focus
my concerns generally

01:25:55.032 --> 01:25:56.990
with the literature with
which we are engaging.

01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:58.610
AUDIENCE: So you're saying
this was an omission

01:25:58.610 --> 01:25:59.650
from [INAUDIBLE] writing?

01:25:59.650 --> 01:26:00.400
AUDIENCE: Correct.

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:03.495
Yes, specifically.

01:26:03.495 --> 01:26:07.188
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:07.188 --> 01:26:09.230
MARTIN: I would counter,
in terms of-- because it

01:26:09.230 --> 01:26:11.180
is a question of our time.

01:26:11.180 --> 01:26:13.610
I think that there will
be an organization that

01:26:13.610 --> 01:26:16.950
is more prone to females
that does better [INAUDIBLE]

01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:18.470
doing it or there's
an organization

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:21.948
that's all-female because of
the structure being different.

01:26:21.948 --> 01:26:24.240
Because it's something that
I started seeing when I did

01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:27.980
work as a diplomat in Mexico.

01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:30.450
Their social structure
was much more extreme.

01:26:30.450 --> 01:26:33.140
So if a daughter was
seen working with a man,

01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.380
the parents would like, ugh.

01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:37.880
So they started making special
groups just for these females

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:40.055
so they can move forward
and get an education.

01:26:40.055 --> 01:26:41.430
And I think that's
a problem that

01:26:41.430 --> 01:26:44.870
can be more prevalent outside
the US than in the US.

01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:46.392
But also, if you
give a good answer

01:26:46.392 --> 01:26:47.600
and have really good talent--

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.900
because these people are really
more competing for talent.

01:26:49.900 --> 01:26:52.490
And you find a way of accessing
it and changing your structure.

01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:54.115
Because it might be
that this structure

01:26:54.115 --> 01:26:56.000
of always being very intense.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.403
Being on location is a
problem women with children,

01:26:59.403 --> 01:27:01.070
so maybe changing the
structure around--

01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:04.170
Yahoo try to do this,
[INAUDIBLE] ability

01:27:04.170 --> 01:27:06.045
to work from home or
choose specific days

01:27:06.045 --> 01:27:07.670
so you can hang out
with your children.

01:27:07.670 --> 01:27:10.130
Also because most-- more
organizations are going to try

01:27:10.130 --> 01:27:11.600
to become--

01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.053
they want this model.

01:27:13.053 --> 01:27:15.470
I think there's going to be
companies that are going to be

01:27:15.470 --> 01:27:18.230
very intense and then
mix vacation time,

01:27:18.230 --> 01:27:20.845
because they know work life
balance [INAUDIBLE]---- well,

01:27:20.845 --> 01:27:22.245
it's not working.

01:27:22.245 --> 01:27:23.870
So you have to find
a way of mixing it.

01:27:23.870 --> 01:27:26.495
So it's like, OK, you have this
problem, you have this project,

01:27:26.495 --> 01:27:29.630
you've got a deadline, and then
you have two, three days off.

01:27:29.630 --> 01:27:32.060
Because you need to
have a certain intensity

01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:35.270
for a certain amount of time,
but that you can kind of relax.

01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:38.810
And that's going to lead to
less turnover in employees.

01:27:38.810 --> 01:27:40.070
Because that's a big issue.

01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:42.070
If you have employees
that are working very hard

01:27:42.070 --> 01:27:43.250
and they don't get a break--

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:45.622
if you have a cord be
too tight, it snaps,

01:27:45.622 --> 01:27:47.830
and so you want to make some
loosening and tightening

01:27:47.830 --> 01:27:49.280
to get a right cord.

01:27:51.417 --> 01:27:53.000
AUDIENCE: I also
wonder how applicable

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.630
this is to the context
outside the West

01:27:55.630 --> 01:27:56.900
and outside the United States.

01:27:56.900 --> 01:27:59.150
In terms of work culture and
organizational structure,

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:03.560
I think a lot of other countries
culturally or just society

01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:07.410
have different senses
of obligation to family

01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:08.460
and community at large.

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:10.100
So I think that
this is definitely

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.240
a very Western, maybe
very US-centric approach

01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.620
to how analyze great groups.

01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:15.620
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Yes.

01:28:15.620 --> 01:28:17.780
Sanam, I think that's
an important point.

01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:21.910
This great group series
that we're doing really

01:28:21.910 --> 01:28:24.280
does reflect an
American culture.

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.870
And how does that
great group theory

01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:28.270
translate into other cultures?

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:30.910
I think that's a really an
important underlying question.

01:28:30.910 --> 01:28:34.120
And as we said a
couple of weeks ago,

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:37.280
I am open to other great groups.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.580
So when you all have
candidates that open up--

01:28:42.580 --> 01:28:44.200
is the 1970s.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.420
That's as far as we've gotten.

01:28:46.420 --> 01:28:49.600
We've covered the 1940s
pretty well and '50s.

01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:52.180
Now, we're at the '70s.

01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:54.567
Not much has changed.

01:28:54.567 --> 01:28:56.650
And I'm not sure much
changes in any of the groups

01:28:56.650 --> 01:28:58.360
that we're going to
talk about today.

01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:01.270
I think it starts to get
better in places like Genentech

01:29:01.270 --> 01:29:03.400
and Craig Venter's operation.

01:29:07.435 --> 01:29:09.810
And the problem is you've got
to find a technology that's

01:29:09.810 --> 01:29:12.780
taken off so you can prove
that the group accomplished

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:13.818
something.

01:29:13.818 --> 01:29:15.360
So if you all would
help me with this

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:17.370
and find examples that I
can include in the group,

01:29:17.370 --> 01:29:17.870
it'll be--

01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:21.930
MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE] is
capitalism and technology

01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:23.530
so that's going to be a group--

01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:27.680
it is going to be
pretty much white males.

01:29:27.680 --> 01:29:29.730
If we redefined it as
the top working groups

01:29:29.730 --> 01:29:30.790
in different fields--

01:29:30.790 --> 01:29:33.510
so it can be like
music, like soul music.

01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:35.073
How do they stretch themselves?

01:29:35.073 --> 01:29:36.740
We might be able to
find [INAUDIBLE]----

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:37.110
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
Yeah, you tried

01:29:37.110 --> 01:29:38.443
to raise this last week, Martin.

01:29:38.443 --> 01:29:39.120
MARTIN: Yeah.

01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:41.328
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: I still
wanted technology though.

01:29:41.328 --> 01:29:43.840
MARTIN: [INAUDIBLE] or maybe
you can go back in time

01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:44.510
[INAUDIBLE] different countries.

01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:44.820
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
I don't know.

01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:46.403
I think things are
starting to change.

01:29:46.403 --> 01:29:46.903
We'll see.

01:29:46.903 --> 01:29:48.861
MARTIN: We're also looking
at the popular ones.

01:29:48.861 --> 01:29:50.490
So maybe we can look
at top technology

01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:53.462
in like India, top technology
groups in other countries.

01:29:53.462 --> 01:29:54.545
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN: Right.

01:29:54.545 --> 01:29:57.240
AUDIENCE: I think we
already did Japan.

01:29:57.240 --> 01:29:59.820
The thing that I
remember kicking myself

01:29:59.820 --> 01:30:02.070
for not bringing up, when
you were talking about Japan

01:30:02.070 --> 01:30:05.540
and how incredibly prolific
they were, and the--

01:30:05.540 --> 01:30:08.720
their economic growth is
that they created effectively

01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:11.530
a workplace culture that
relied on two factors--

01:30:11.530 --> 01:30:13.740
one, devoting your
entire life to your job--

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.100
one job you choose.

01:30:15.100 --> 01:30:18.190
You're with a company for
the rest of your time there.

01:30:18.190 --> 01:30:21.720
And then two, that if
your entire self-worth

01:30:21.720 --> 01:30:24.510
as an individual is tied to
your success within this company

01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:27.820
or the success of the company
generally, then if you fail

01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:30.730
or if the company fails, you
feel like you're effectively

01:30:30.730 --> 01:30:31.230
threatened.

01:30:31.230 --> 01:30:32.610
And what I mentioned
to Bill, and something

01:30:32.610 --> 01:30:34.027
that you may know,
is that there's

01:30:34.027 --> 01:30:36.860
an incredibly high suicide
rate amongst Japanese workers.

01:30:36.860 --> 01:30:40.140
So what does that mean if the
culture that we are trying

01:30:40.140 --> 01:30:42.840
to create here is
effectively trying

01:30:42.840 --> 01:30:44.450
to emulate Japan's,
because we want

01:30:44.450 --> 01:30:46.200
to achieve their level
of economic growth,

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:49.950
if it is that they have
reached the sort of peak human?

01:30:49.950 --> 01:30:51.420
Is that what we
have to aspire to?

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:53.640
And what might be
some lessons for us

01:30:53.640 --> 01:30:55.870
to learn from that
country, as a great group?

01:30:58.470 --> 01:31:00.668
WILLIAM BONVILLIAN:
OK, that's fair enough.

01:31:00.668 --> 01:31:03.210
So Luyao, do you want to give
us a couple of closing thoughts

01:31:03.210 --> 01:31:05.280
about the groups you looked at?

01:31:05.280 --> 01:31:09.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think
definitely these lessons

01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:20.490
learned [INAUDIBLE] I'm
amazed, as a Chinese background

01:31:20.490 --> 01:31:24.340
student, with this flat
structure of a lab.

01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:26.640
That would never happen
in Chinese culture.

01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:28.240
It is always hierarchical.

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:36.945
I think other things that's
been changing better in China

01:31:36.945 --> 01:31:40.860
is the sense of female
scientists' position in China

01:31:40.860 --> 01:31:46.560
has been actually leading in
all these other countries.

01:31:46.560 --> 01:31:48.870
We have a larger number of
female scientists, I think--

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:53.520
we are highly ranked.

01:31:53.520 --> 01:31:56.070
And there are
lessons to be learned

01:31:56.070 --> 01:32:00.740
from different countries
and from across history.

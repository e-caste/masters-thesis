00:00:21.282 --> 00:00:22.310
PROFESSOR: All right.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.750
So today, we'll continue our
kind of review that included,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.130
of course, the last lecture,
the variational principle that's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.560
supposed to be new stuff
you didn't see in 804.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.690
And today, as we
continue, we'll talk

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.930
about position and momentum for
about 30 minutes or 40 minutes,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.430
and then begin
the study of spin.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.110
That will be spin-1/2 with
a Stern-Gerlach experiment

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.430
and the mathematics
that comes out of it.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.310
Now, we will talk about the
Stern-Gerlach experiment

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.440
in quite some detail
so that you can

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.770
appreciate what
was going on there.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.060
And then we will extract a few
of the mathematical lessons

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.410
that this experiment tells
us about quantum mechanics.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.530
Immediately after
that, which will

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.030
be probably middle of next
lecture, we will pivot.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.580
And as we learn this
mathematics that

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.790
the Stern-Gerlach experiment
is telling us or asking us for,

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:42.700
we will go in some detail
on the necessary mathematics

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.190
for quantum mechanics.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.790
We'll talk about vector
spaces, linear operators,

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.200
Hermitian operators, unitary
operators, [INAUDIBLE],

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.740
matrix representations,
all kinds of things.

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.120
That probably will be about two
weeks, three lectures at least.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.940
So it will be a nice study.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:10.190
And in that way,
people that don't

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.370
have a background
in linear algebra

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.360
will feel more comfortable with
what we're going to be doing.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.880
And I think even
for the people that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.140
have a background
in linear algebra,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.470
you will gain a new
appreciation about the concepts

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.950
that we meet here.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.790
So today, we begin, therefore,
with position and momentum,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.640
and these are operators
in quantum mechanics.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.260
And they have letters
to denote them. x,

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.900
we put a hat with it,
that's a position operator.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.730
p, we put a hat on it.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:52.460
And the position and momentum
operators don't commute.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.250
And the commutator
is given by ih bar.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.990
Now, we have been dealing
so far with wave functions.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.920
Our wave functions, where
these functions of x and t,

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.210
they represent the dynamics
of your system, the dynamics

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:13.410
of your particle as
it moves in time.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:18.140
But time, as you are seeing
in quantum mechanics,

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.602
is a little bit of a spectator.

00:03:19.602 --> 00:03:21.980
It's an arena where
things happen.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.670
But the operators, and most
of the interesting things,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.570
are going on without
reference to time.

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:32.780
Time evolution, you
have an expansion

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.140
of a wave function
in terms of energy,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.340
eigenstates, at a given time.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.650
And then you can
evolve it easily

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.700
with the way we've
learned, adding e

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:50.340
to the minus i et over h bar
for each energy eigenstate.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.710
So time will play no role here.

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.380
So when I talk about the
wave function, at this moment

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.630
you could put the
time, but we will

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.400
talk about the wave functions
that have no time dependence.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.700
So, say, a psi of
x wave function.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.970
So this psi of x may be the true
wave function at time equals 0,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:23.510
or you could just simply
think of it as the psi of x.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:26.770
Now, this wave function
means that we're

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.420
treating x in a
particular way, and we

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.310
say that we're working in the
x representation, the position

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.570
representation.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.870
Now, this means that
we have an easy way

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.800
to figure out what
this operator does

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.700
when it acts on this function.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.320
So what it acts
on this function,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.840
it will give you
another function,

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.730
and the definition of
this is that the position

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.810
operator acting on
the function psi of x

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.070
is defined to be
another function,

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.845
which is the function
x times psi of x.

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:20.025
Well, we're talking about these
wave functions and operators

00:05:20.025 --> 00:05:21.380
on wave functions.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:25.550
And a recurrent theme
in quantum mechanics

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.660
is that we will think
of wave functions,

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.160
sometimes we call them states.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.200
Sometimes we call them vectors.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.640
And we basically think of
wave functions as vectors.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.550
And things that act
on wave functions

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.480
are the things that
act on vectors.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.390
And the things that
act on vectors,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:50.110
as you know in
mathematics, is matrices.

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.530
So we're compelled, even
at this early stage,

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:57.600
to get a picture of
how that language would

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.410
go if we're talking
about these things.

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:07.020
So how do we think of a
wave function as a vector?

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:12.000
And how do we think
of x as a matrix?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.550
So there's a way to do that.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:21.580
It will not be totally
precise, but it's clear enough.

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.340
So suppose you have
a wave function,

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.545
and we're interested in
its values from 0 up to a.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:38.230
This wave function is a
function of x between 0 and a.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:45.250
So it's the psi of x
for x between a and 0.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.420
That's all the information.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.410
What we're going to
do is we're going

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:55.540
to divide this thing,
this line, this segment,

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.940
into a lot of pieces.

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.610
And we're going to
say, look, instead

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:03.040
of writing a function like
sine of x or cosine of x,

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.910
let's just give the
values and organize them

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.780
as if this will be a
vector of many components.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:15.800
So let's divide this
in sizes epsilon,

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:20.510
such that N times
epsilon is equal to a.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.700
So there are N of
these intervals.

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.696
So we think of psi as a
vector whose first component

00:07:29.696 --> 00:07:31.390
is psi at 0.

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:34.190
The second is psi at epsilon.

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:38.500
The third is psi at 2 epsilon.

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.560
And the last one is
psi at N epsilon.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:47.370
And depending on how much
accuracy you want to work with,

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:54.390
you take epsilon smaller and
larger, keeping a constant.

00:07:54.390 --> 00:07:59.110
And this would be like
summarizing all the information

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:00.705
of a function in a vector.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:08.800
Now, that's intuitively a
nice way to think of it.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.960
May look, with your background
in classical physics,

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:18.910
a little strange that we
sort of put the value at 0

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:22.740
along the x-axis, first
component, the value at epsilon

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:26.260
along the y, the value
of 2 epsilon along the z.

00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:27.630
But we need more axes.

00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.270
So you need many axes here.

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:39.299
In this case, this is a
N plus 1 column vector.

00:08:39.299 --> 00:08:43.480
It has N plus 1
entries, because 0 up

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.740
to N, that's N plus 1 entries.

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:53.900
But that's a fine way
of thinking of it.

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.700
Not exact because
we have an epsilon.

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:00.020
In this way of thinking
about the wave function,

00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:08.110
we can then ask, what does
the matrix x hat look like?

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:13.110
So x hat is an operator,
and it acts this way.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.650
So here is how it looks like.

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:25.180
We would think of x hat as an
N plus 1 times N plus 1 matrix.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:33.150
And its entries
are 0 everywhere,

00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:35.190
except in the
diagonal, where they

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:41.980
are 0 epsilon, 2
epsilon, up to N epsilon.

00:09:44.685 --> 00:09:47.265
And here is a big 0 and a big 0.

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:55.700
This, I claim, is the way you
should think of the x operator

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:01.640
if you thought of the wave
function the way we wrote it.

00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.380
And how do we check that?

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:09.500
Well, x operator acting on psi
should be this acting on that.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:13.200
And then, indeed,
we see that if x hat

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.560
is acting on psi of
x, what do we get?

00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:25.350
Well, it's easy to multiply a
diagonal matrix times a vector.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:31.190
Here you get 0 times psi of 0.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:36.390
You get a vector, so let
me make this thinner.

00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:45.180
Then I get epsilon times psi
of epsilon, 2 epsilon times

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:53.090
psi of 2 epsilon, up to N
epsilon times psi of N epsilon.

00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:58.490
And indeed, that matrix looks
like the matrix associated

00:10:58.490 --> 00:11:02.890
with this wave
function because here

00:11:02.890 --> 00:11:05.950
is the value at 0 of
this wave function.

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:11.040
Here is the value at epsilon of
this wave function, and so on.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:15.410
So this has worked
out all right.

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:20.560
We can think of the wave
function as a column vector,

00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.540
and then the position operator
as this vector as well.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:32.670
Now, given that we know how
the x operator is defined,

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.250
we can also think
easily about what

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:40.810
is the expectation value
of x on a wave function.

00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.800
Something that you
really know, but now

00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.370
maybe becomes a little clearer.

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:49.850
Here you're supposed
to do psi star

00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:56.590
of x times the x operator
acting on psi of x.

00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:59.220
But we have the
definition of this,

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:05.040
so this is, as you imagine, dx--
and I should put primes maybe,

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.430
well, I don't have to
put primes-- dx psi

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.910
star of x x psi of
x, which is what

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:16.575
you would have done anyway.

00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.200
Well, given that we've started
with this, we can ask also,

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.960
is there eigenstates
of the x operator?

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.970
Yes, there are.

00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:44.790
but then fortunately,
are a bit singular.

00:12:44.790 --> 00:12:48.150
So what should be
an eigenstate of x?

00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.860
It's some sort of state.

00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.480
Intuitively, it has a definite
value of the position.

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.970
So it just exists
for some value of x.

00:12:57.970 --> 00:13:01.390
So it's naturally thought
as a delta function.

00:13:01.390 --> 00:13:09.370
So let me define a
function, psi sub x0 of x.

00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.530
So it's a function
of x labeled by x0,

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:17.320
and define it to be
delta of x minus x0.

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:24.790
So I claim that is an
eigenstate of x hat.

00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:31.750
x hat on psi x0 of x is
equal, by definition,

00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:42.990
to x times psi x0 of x, which
is x times delta of x minus x0.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.220
And when you multiply
a function of x

00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:48.250
times a delta
function in x, it is

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:50.660
possible to evaluate
the function that

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.550
is being multiplied
by the delta function

00:13:53.550 --> 00:13:57.350
at the place where the
delta function fires.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:14:00.880
It has the same effect
on integrals or anything

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.730
that you would do.

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:08.230
So here, this is equal to
x0 times delta x minus x0.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.950
You evaluate the x at x0.

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:18.550
And finally, this is x0 times
that function psi x0 of x.

00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:23.490
And therefore, you've shown
that this operator acting

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.510
on this function reproduces
the function-- that's

00:14:27.510 --> 00:14:30.880
the definition of
eigenstate as an operator--

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.170
and the eigenvalue is the number
that appears here, and it's x0.

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:44.150
So this function
is an eigenstate

00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:51.950
of x hat with
eigenvalue, e.v., x0.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.260
The only complication
with this eigenfunction

00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.780
is that it's not normalizable.

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:09.060
So it doesn't
represent the particle.

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:13.690
It can be used to
represent the particle,

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:16.490
but it's a useful function.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.000
You can think of it
as something that

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.360
can help you do physics,
and don't insist

00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:26.000
that it represents a particle.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.640
So this is the
story for position.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.680
And the position gets actually
more interesting as soon

00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.380
as you introduce the
dual quantity, momentum.

00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:40.660
So what is momentum here?

00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:55.020
So momentum is an operator, and
this operator must be defined.

00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:59.890
Now, you had a
shorthand for it in 804,

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:04.790
which is p hat equal
h bar over i d dx.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:10.910
And this shorthand
means actually

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:17.220
that, in what we call the
position representation where

00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:22.420
we're using wave functions
that depend on x, well,

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.190
the momentum is given
by this operator.

00:16:25.190 --> 00:16:27.880
And the story of why
this was the case

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.150
was sort of something
that was elaborated

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:33.870
on in 804, the work
of de Broglie, that

00:16:33.870 --> 00:16:38.430
saw that the
wavelength of the wave

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:40.620
has to do with the
momentum of a wave.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.850
And finally, people
understood that this

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:46.080
would measure the
momentum of the wave.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.800
So this is the operator.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.570
And therefore, in the
representation that

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.750
we're working-- representation
is a word that has a lot

00:16:56.750 --> 00:17:00.250
of precise meaning, but now
I'm just using it in the sense

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.430
that, well, we're working
either with x's or with p's.

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:05.140
And we're working with x's.

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:09.440
That's why p looks like
something to do with x.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:13.369
So what is p hat
on a wave function?

00:17:13.369 --> 00:17:17.739
Well, that's what this means.

00:17:17.739 --> 00:17:20.119
It's another wave
function obtained

00:17:20.119 --> 00:17:23.990
by taking the x derivative.

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:28.620
So that's the definition of
it acting on a wave function.

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:33.310
The one thing that must
be verified, of course,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:38.340
is that this definition
is consistent or implies

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:39.780
this commutation relation.

00:17:43.330 --> 00:17:46.840
So you've defined
it as an operator.

00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:49.770
x, we've defined
it as an operator.

00:17:49.770 --> 00:17:51.330
But most of us think
that it doesn't

00:17:51.330 --> 00:17:53.850
look like an operator
is multiplying.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.580
But it is an operator.

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:59.230
So this one does look
like an operator.

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:02.000
It's a differential operator.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.250
And you can try to see
if this equation is true.

00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.900
And the way to test
these commutators

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.110
is something that,
again, I don't think

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:17.630
is unfamiliar to you,
but let's go through it,

00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:24.070
is that you try to evaluate
this product of operators

00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:27.510
acting on a wave function.

00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:32.400
And if things work
out well, we'll

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:40.174
see you should get ih bar
times that wave function.

00:18:40.174 --> 00:18:43.090
If that is the case,
you say, OK, I've

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:47.670
proven that equation, because
it's an operator equation.

00:18:47.670 --> 00:18:50.440
The left-hand side
of that equation

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.510
is the product in different
orders of two operators,

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:55.290
therefore it's an operator.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.710
The right-hand side
is another operator.

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:02.270
It's the operator multiplied by
ih, anything that you'll get.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:07.530
Well, if this is an
operator identity,

00:19:07.530 --> 00:19:10.250
the operator on the left
must be equal to the operator

00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:14.440
on the right, which just means
that, acting on anything,

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.080
they must give the same answer.

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:20.000
So if I managed to prove
that this is equal to this,

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.550
I've proven that for
anything that is the answer.

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:28.330
And therefore, I can
write the top one.

00:19:28.330 --> 00:19:31.890
And let me just do
it, even though this

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:37.240
may be kind of familiar
to many of you.

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:42.510
It's good to do this
slowly once in your life.

00:19:42.510 --> 00:19:44.800
So let's go through this.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.360
So this says x operator
p operator on psi

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.840
minus p operator of
x operator on psi.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:01.460
When you have several operators,
like ABC acting on psi,

00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.990
this really means
let C act on psi,

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:11.960
and then let B act on C psi,
and then let A act on that.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.970
The operators act one by one.

00:20:13.970 --> 00:20:16.360
The closest one acts first.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:21.540
So here I'm supposed
to let B act on psi,

00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:23.160
but that means that thing.

00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:30.180
So now x is acting
on h over i d psi dx.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:40.090
On this one, I have
p acting on x psi,

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:43.900
because that's
what x hat psi is.

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:47.770
Here, this is multiplication
by x of a function of x.

00:20:47.770 --> 00:20:52.120
So this is just h
over i x d psi dx.

00:20:55.310 --> 00:21:01.920
And here, I have h over i d
dx of this whole thing x psi.

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.750
And you can see that
when you act here,

00:21:07.750 --> 00:21:12.080
you act first on the x,
and you get something.

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.580
And then you act on the psi,
and you get this same term.

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:24.130
So the only contribution
here is equal to minus h over

00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:28.330
i, the d dx on x
times psi, which

00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:32.530
is ih bar psi, which is
what I wanted to show.

00:21:36.050 --> 00:21:41.170
So this is true.

00:21:41.170 --> 00:21:44.880
And therefore, you could
say that this definition is

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.800
consistent with your
definition of x,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:51.710
and they represent
this operator.

00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:57.010
One more thing you could try
to do, and it's fun to do it,

00:21:57.010 --> 00:22:02.930
is we had a matrix
representation for x.

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:05.353
Can I think of p as a matrix?

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.180
How would you do it?

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.880
What kind of matrix
would p look like?

00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.386
Well, yes?

00:22:17.386 --> 00:22:20.410
AUDIENCE: You just generate
a finite difference equation.

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:22.620
PROFESSOR: You could
do it, exactly,

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:25.920
with taking finite differences.

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:28.590
So for example, if
you think that you

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:35.555
want to produce the wave
function psi prime at 0,

00:22:35.555 --> 00:22:39.200
psi prime at epsilon,
psi prime, that's

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:41.240
what the derivative
gives you, you'll

00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:47.970
write this as 1 over
epsilon, say, psi at epsilon

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.040
minus psi at 0.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.950
That's the derivative
at 0 roughly.

00:22:53.950 --> 00:23:00.720
It would be psi at 2 epsilon
minus psi at 0 over 2.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.759
And you could build it.

00:23:03.759 --> 00:23:04.550
You could build it.

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:05.600
I'm not going to do it.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.920
You may want to do
it and try and see

00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:13.550
how the derivative
operator looks as a matrix.

00:23:13.550 --> 00:23:18.100
And then if you really want
to spend some time thinking

00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.770
about it, you could try
to see if this matrix

00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:27.000
and this matrix commute
to give the right answer.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.800
And as you try it,
you will figure out

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:32.430
all kinds of funny
things that we

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:34.580
will talk about
later in the course.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:39.010
So you can represent the
momentum operator as a matrix

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:41.580
indeed, and there are
interesting things

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:47.960
to say about it, and
it's a good subject.

00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.090
So let's continue
with the momentum

00:23:52.090 --> 00:23:55.380
and ask for eigenstates
of the momentum.

00:23:55.380 --> 00:24:06.796
So eigenstates of
p, you know them.

00:24:06.796 --> 00:24:09.250
They're e to the ipx things.

00:24:09.250 --> 00:24:13.650
So let's write them with some
convenient normalization.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:18.780
This is an [INAUDIBLE]
wave function

00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.880
that depends on x
with momentum p.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.250
And we'll write it,
as a definition,

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:32.000
as e to the ipx over h bar, and
I'll put it a 2 pi h bar here.

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:38.440
It's kind of a
useful normalization.

00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:46.530
Then p hat on psi p of x,
well, p hat is supposed

00:24:46.530 --> 00:24:56.615
to take h over i d dx, and
take h over i d dx of psi p.

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:03.330
And h over i cancels
the i over h.

00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:05.680
When you take the d
dx, you get p out,

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.520
and you get the
same wave function.

00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.590
So indeed, you get
p times psi p of x.

00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:19.010
So indeed, this is the
eigenstate of the momentum

00:25:19.010 --> 00:25:21.655
operator, and it has momentum p.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:28.150
Well, what is the use of this?

00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:33.370
Well, say you have a
representation, what

00:25:33.370 --> 00:25:36.180
we call the position
representation,

00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:38.880
of the wave function
and operators.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.450
Let us think now of the
momentum representation.

00:25:42.450 --> 00:25:45.200
So what does all that mean?

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.760
Well, there is the Fourier
transform operation

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.780
in which we have psi of p.

00:25:54.780 --> 00:26:00.780
Well, let me write it
this way, actually.

00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:05.930
I'll write any psi
of x physically

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:11.340
can be represented as a sum
of momentum eigenstates.

00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:15.040
Therefore, that's
Fourier's theorem,

00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:23.600
minus infinity to infinity
dp e to the ipx over h bar

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:29.060
square root of 2 pi
h psi tilde of p.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:38.870
That's Fourier transformation,
defines psi tilde of p.

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:44.450
And Fourier's theorem is
the fact that not only you

00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:49.020
can do that, but you can invert
it so that psi tilde of p

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.935
can also be written as an
integral, this time over x

00:26:52.935 --> 00:27:00.620
from minus infinity to infinity
e to the minus ipx over h

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:09.190
bar, also 2 pi h bar psi of x.

00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:12.690
So let's ponder this equation
for a couple of minutes.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:21.820
Well, as a physicist,
you think of this, well,

00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.910
this is telling me that
any wave function could

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:30.380
be written as a superposition
of momentum eigenstates.

00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:33.050
Here are the
momentum eigenstates.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.140
And for each value
of momentum, you

00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.040
have some coefficient here
that tells me how much of that

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.640
momentum eigenstate I have.

00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:46.600
Now, here is the opposite one.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:52.050
Psi tilde of p and psi of
x are related in this way.

00:27:52.050 --> 00:27:55.340
So these coefficients, if
you want to calculate them,

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.900
you calculate them this way.

00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:03.100
But now let's think of it as
a change of representation.

00:28:06.810 --> 00:28:10.210
The physics is
contained in psi of x.

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:15.060
All what you wish to know about
this physical system in quantum

00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:18.040
mechanics is there in psi of x.

00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:21.600
But it's also there in
psi of p, because they

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.270
contain the same information.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:28.370
So there are different ways of
encoding the same information.

00:28:31.540 --> 00:28:36.150
What is the relation
between them?

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:39.240
This, we thought
of it as a vector,

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:44.210
vector in position space, an
infinite dimensional space

00:28:44.210 --> 00:28:46.880
that is talking about positions.

00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:51.580
This is another vector
in momentum space.

00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.720
Think of it now
the infinite line.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.390
So this is an infinite vector
with all those points little

00:28:58.390 --> 00:29:02.030
by little, from minus infinity
to plus infinity, all of them

00:29:02.030 --> 00:29:05.300
there, gigantic vector.

00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:08.410
And here is another
gigantic vector with p

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:11.250
from minus infinity to infinity.

00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.420
And in between,
there's an integral.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.530
But now, with your picture
of quantum mechanics,

00:29:17.530 --> 00:29:21.740
you see an integral, but
you also see a matrix.

00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:23.580
And what is this matrix?

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.650
Think of this as some
sort of psi sub p.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:38.590
And this as some
sort of matrix, px

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:47.020
psi x, in which if you have a
product-- you'll remember when

00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:51.230
you multiply matrices,
a matrix on a vector,

00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:54.520
you sum over the second index.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:56.360
That's the product for matrix.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.400
And then the first
index is the index here.

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:04.330
So here is what it,
more or less, is like.

00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:07.040
Psi tilde of p
[? subtend ?] by this,

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.750
and this matrix depends on two
labels, p and x, and it's that.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:16.340
So it's a matrix full of phases.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:20.020
So how do you pass from the
coordinate representation

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.490
of the information, a vector
of all values of the wave

00:30:23.490 --> 00:30:25.340
function in all positions?

00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:31.140
By multiplying with this
matrix of phases that is here,

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:33.070
and it gives you
this representation.

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:38.670
So different representations
means using different vectors

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:42.140
to represent the physics.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:45.610
And this vector is
a very nice one.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:49.070
And because of these properties
of the momentum operator

00:30:49.070 --> 00:30:52.940
and all these things, this
vector is also a very nice one.

00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.690
And there's an
integral transform

00:30:55.690 --> 00:30:59.480
or some sort of infinite matrix
product that relates them.

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.700
And we shouldn't be
uncomfortable about it.

00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.260
That's all fine.

00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:12.190
So we say that we
have, for example,

00:31:12.190 --> 00:31:22.260
psi of x as one representation
of the state and psi tilde of p

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.635
as another representation
of the same physics.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:38.780
We can do one more thing
here, If I continue.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:46.160
We can take that boxed equation
on the blackboard up there

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:54.430
and act with h bar over
i d dx on psi of x.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:02.160
So that is equal to
h i d dx, and I'll

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:08.070
write what psi of x is, is
minus infinity to infinity dp e

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:12.680
to the ipx over
h bar square root

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:17.950
of 2 pi h bar psi tilde of p.

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:28.190
Now, when we act on this, as
you know, h bar over i d dx

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:32.020
just acts on this and
produces the factor of p.

00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:38.410
So this is equal to minus
infinity to infinity dp e

00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:45.890
to the ipx over h bar over
square root of 2 pi h bar p

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:48.140
times psi tilde of p.

00:32:54.720 --> 00:32:59.240
So look at this equation again.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.940
This double arrow is
to mean that there

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.080
are equivalent physics in them.

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:06.790
They have the same information.

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:10.300
It's the same data encoded
in a different way.

00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.329
And that different
way, this arrow

00:33:13.329 --> 00:33:14.412
is Fourier transformation.

00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.750
And this Fourier transformation
is explained here.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:26.920
So now you have Fourier
transformation the same way.

00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.270
So here we have--
what we've learned

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:41.120
is that h over i d dx of psi is
represented in momentum space

00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:47.060
by p psi tilde of p.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:52.620
And this was p hat
acting on psi of x.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:34:00.900
So the corresponding thing
in momentum space of p hat

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:08.530
acting on psi of x is p
multiplying psi tilde of p,

00:34:08.530 --> 00:34:15.590
which is to say that we can
think of the abstract operator

00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:25.620
p hat acting on psi tilde of
p as just p psi tilde of p.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:39.639
So in momentum space,
the operator p hat

00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:41.260
acts in a very easy way.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.300
In coordinate space,
it takes derivatives.

00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:51.940
In momentum space,
it's multiplicative.

00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:58.620
So in position space,
x is multiplicative.

00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:05.380
But in momentum space, x
would not be multiplicative.

00:35:05.380 --> 00:35:07.780
x would also be a derivative.

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.870
So I leave it for
you as an exercise

00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:19.540
to show that or convince
yourself in several ways,

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:34.270
that x hat is really i h bar d
dp in p space, in i h bar d dp.

00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.760
All right.

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:43.590
So that's really all I wanted to
say about position and momentum

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.850
operators at this moment.

00:35:45.850 --> 00:35:49.960
They will come back when we'll
introduce bra-ket notation

00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.460
in detail.

00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:52.550
We'll revisit this a little.

00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:56.690
But the main concepts
have been illustrated.

00:35:56.690 --> 00:35:57.980
Are there questions?

00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.330
We're about to leave
this, so if you

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:02.750
have any questions
at this moment.

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:03.310
Yes?

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:04.795
AUDIENCE: Could
you explain again

00:36:04.795 --> 00:36:10.240
how you used this
[INAUDIBLE] h bar over i d dx

00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:12.730
assign to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:12.730 --> 00:36:13.920
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.760
So the question was, why did
I associate these things?

00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.340
So it really goes back here to
what the meaning of this arrow

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:25.420
is.

00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:28.510
The meaning of this arrow
is Fourier transformation.

00:36:28.510 --> 00:36:34.420
So this psi tilde and psi of
x are related in this way.

00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.540
That's Fourier
transformation, and that's

00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:38.850
what we mean by this arrow.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:43.950
It also means that whatever
physics you have here,

00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.760
you have it there.

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:52.570
So really, when you have
something acting on a state,

00:36:52.570 --> 00:36:56.050
for example, if you have some
operator acting in here, well,

00:36:56.050 --> 00:36:58.270
you get a new wave function.

00:36:58.270 --> 00:37:00.410
And there should be
one on the right that

00:37:00.410 --> 00:37:03.810
corresponds to it, that has
the same information as the one

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:06.030
in which you've
acted with something.

00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:10.330
So what we claim here is that,
also in the sense of Fourier

00:37:10.330 --> 00:37:15.420
transformation or having the
same information, h bar over i,

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:20.130
the derivative of psi,
is encoded by this.

00:37:20.130 --> 00:37:24.660
So we say, thinking
abstractly, what is this?

00:37:24.660 --> 00:37:28.970
This is the momentum operator.

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:35.350
Therefore, I'm going to say that
the momentum operator really

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:39.000
is the same momentum
operator, whether it acts

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.810
on wave functions that you show
them to mean this way or wave

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:45.680
functions that, because
you're in another mood,

00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:48.660
you decide to give them
to me in momentum space.

00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:53.690
So as you change your mood, the
operator takes different forms

00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:56.380
but is doing the same thing.

00:37:56.380 --> 00:37:58.030
It's totally reversible.

00:37:58.030 --> 00:38:02.460
It's acting on that-- you
see, the operator is always

00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:06.370
the same, but you give me the
data in two different ways,

00:38:06.370 --> 00:38:10.170
then the operator has to do
the thing in a different way.

00:38:10.170 --> 00:38:12.770
So that's what it means
that the operator has

00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:15.030
different representations.

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:16.770
In the [INAUDIBLE]
representation,

00:38:16.770 --> 00:38:18.790
it looks like a derivative.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:21.915
In the momentum representation,
it looks like multiplying.

00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.828
Other questions?

00:38:27.828 --> 00:38:28.806
Yes?

00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:31.904
AUDIENCE: So by saying
that they sort of represent

00:38:31.904 --> 00:38:33.320
[INAUDIBLE] to the
same positions,

00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:36.605
does that mean that h bar over
i p e to the xi and p psi p

00:38:36.605 --> 00:38:38.620
are like the same [INAUDIBLE]?

00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:43.690
PROFESSOR: That h bar over
d dx psi and p-- yeah.

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:47.400
They are the same
data, the same state

00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.345
represented in different ways.

00:38:49.345 --> 00:38:49.845
Yeah.

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:55.470
All right.

00:38:55.470 --> 00:38:58.470
So time for a change.

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:03.460
We're going to talk about
Stern-Gerlach and spin.

00:39:03.460 --> 00:39:09.580
Now, spin will keep us busy the
biggest chunk of this semester.

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:14.310
So it will be spin-1/2, and
we're really going to go

00:39:14.310 --> 00:39:17.200
into enormous detail on it.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.830
So this is just the
beginning of the story that

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:25.030
will be elaborated
at various stages.

00:39:25.030 --> 00:39:30.420
So at this moment, I will
talk about this experiment

00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.090
that led to the
discovery of spin,

00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:37.200
and if you try to invent
the theory that describes

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.050
this experiment, what you
would possibly begin doing.

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.340
And then we go through
the mathematics,

00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:48.720
as I mentioned to you, for maybe
a week and a half or two weeks,

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.260
and then return to the
spin with more tools

00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:55.960
to understand it well.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:00.420
So the subject is the
Stern-Gerlach experiment,

00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:06.050
Stern-Gerlach experiment.

00:40:12.650 --> 00:40:21.080
So the Stern-Gerlach experiment
was done in Frankfurt, 1922.

00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:23.930
It was an experiment
that, in fact, people

00:40:23.930 --> 00:40:25.672
were extraordinarily confused.

00:40:25.672 --> 00:40:29.080
It was not clear why
they were doing it.

00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.590
And for quite a
while, people didn't

00:40:33.590 --> 00:40:37.170
understand what
they were getting,

00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:39.400
what was happening with it.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:46.760
In fact, Pauli had thought
that the electron has

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.890
like two degrees of
freedom and didn't

00:40:48.890 --> 00:40:53.410
know what it was, those
two degrees of freedom.

00:40:53.410 --> 00:40:57.605
Kronig suggested that
it had to do somehow

00:40:57.605 --> 00:41:01.350
with the rotation
of the electron.

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:05.620
Now, Pauli said that's nonsense.

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.950
How can an electron rotate
and have angular momentum

00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:11.770
because it has a rotation?

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:15.450
It would have to rotate
so fast, even faster

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:18.200
than the speed of light to
have the angular momentum,

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.510
and then this little ball
that would be the electron

00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:22.790
would disintegrate.

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:27.060
And it made no sense to him that
there would be such a thing.

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:30.890
So Kronig didn't publish this.

00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:35.986
Then there were another two
people, Uhlenbeck and Goudsmit,

00:41:35.986 --> 00:41:40.190
at the same time,
around 1925, had

00:41:40.190 --> 00:41:44.870
the same idea, angular
momentum of this particle.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:48.860
And their advisor was
Ehrenfest, and said

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.285
it doesn't make too much sense,
but you should publish it.

00:41:52.285 --> 00:41:54.390
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:57.080
And thanks to their
publishing, they

00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:00.430
are given credit for discovering
the spin of the electron.

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:03.390
And Pauli, a couple
of years later,

00:42:03.390 --> 00:42:05.260
decided, after all, I was wrong.

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.380
Yes, it is spin, and
it's all working out.

00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:14.160
And 1927, five years after
the experiment basically,

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:17.110
people understood
what was going on.

00:42:17.110 --> 00:42:20.040
So what were these
people trying to do?

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.400
First, Stern and Gerlach
were atomic physicists,

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:26.550
and they were just
interested in measuring

00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:34.220
speeds of thermal
motion of ions.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:37.460
So they would send
beams of these ions

00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:41.530
and put magnetic fields and
deflect them and measure

00:42:41.530 --> 00:42:43.550
their velocities.

00:42:43.550 --> 00:42:46.170
And eventually,
they were experts

00:42:46.170 --> 00:42:47.580
doing this kind of thing.

00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.630
And they heard of Bohr, that
said that the electron has

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:56.440
angular momentum and is going
around the proton in circles,

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.280
so it might have
angular momentum.

00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.120
They said, oh, if it has
angular momentum because it's

00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.330
going around the proton,
maybe we can detect it.

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:09.080
And when they did the
experiment, they got something.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:11.510
And they said, well,
we're seeing it.

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:14.520
But it was not that.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:17.700
They were not seeing the
orbital angular momentum

00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:24.650
of the electron because that
electron in these silver atoms

00:43:24.650 --> 00:43:27.310
actually has no
angular momentum,

00:43:27.310 --> 00:43:30.340
as we will see, no
orbital angular momentum.

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.370
It only has spin.

00:43:31.370 --> 00:43:34.220
So they were actually
seeing the spin.

00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:36.090
So it was a big confusion.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:37.650
It took some time.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:41.660
Basically, they took the
beam, and they split it

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:45.770
with a magnetic field,
and the clean split

00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:47.510
was something nobody understood.

00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:51.440
So they called it
space quantization,

00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.500
as of it's separated in space.

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:56.710
Space is quantized.

00:43:56.710 --> 00:43:59.570
A pretty awful name, of course.

00:43:59.570 --> 00:44:03.200
There's nothing quantized
about space here.

00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:07.600
But it reflects that when
you don't know what's really

00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:12.500
happening, your names
don't come out too well.

00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:17.460
So what we have to
understand here,

00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:20.540
our goal today is
to just see what's

00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:27.310
happening in that experiment,
quantify a bit the results,

00:44:27.310 --> 00:44:33.050
and then extract the quantum
mechanical lessons from it.

00:44:33.050 --> 00:44:35.900
So let us begin with
the important thing.

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.380
You don't see the spin directly.

00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:43.930
What you see is
magnetic moments.

00:44:43.930 --> 00:44:45.600
So what's that?

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.680
So what are magnetic moments?

00:44:47.680 --> 00:45:00.340
Magnetic moments, mu, is the
analog, the magnetic analog

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.780
of an electric dipole.

00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:03.740
A mu is called a
magnetic dipole.

00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:05.740
You say it has a
magnetic moment.

00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:14.160
And the magnetic moment is
given by I times the area.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.490
What does that mean?

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:20.360
Well, a precise discussion
would take some time.

00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:24.110
But roughly, you
can simplify when

00:45:24.110 --> 00:45:28.150
you think of a loop that is
in a plane, in which case

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:31.270
there's an area
associated to it.

00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:33.570
And if the loop is
this one, the area

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:38.280
is defined as the normal
vector to the oriented loop.

00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:42.140
So an oriented loop
has an area vector.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:43.960
And the orientation
could be focused

00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.500
the direction of the current.

00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:46.450
There is some area.

00:45:46.450 --> 00:45:49.970
And the magnetic moment
is given by this thing.

00:45:49.970 --> 00:45:52.520
It points up in
the circumstances

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.580
when this current
goes like that.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.630
So that's a magnetic moment.

00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.930
A little bit of units.

00:46:01.930 --> 00:46:06.020
The way units work out is
that mu B-- magnetic moments

00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:11.190
and magnetic fields
have units of energy.

00:46:14.680 --> 00:46:19.140
So magnetic moments
you could define

00:46:19.140 --> 00:46:26.450
as energy, which is
joules, divided by tesla,

00:46:26.450 --> 00:46:32.520
or ergs divided by
gauss, because mu B has

00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:35.490
units of energy.

00:46:35.490 --> 00:46:39.300
So how do magnetic
moments originate

00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:43.340
in a charge configuration?

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.230
Well, you can simply have
a little current like that.

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:49.630
But let's consider a
different situation

00:46:49.630 --> 00:46:58.040
in which you have
a ring of charge,

00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:08.945
a ring of charge of some radius
R. It has a total charge Q,

00:47:08.945 --> 00:47:12.350
and it has a linear
charge density lambda.

00:47:12.350 --> 00:47:17.980
It's uniform, and it's
rotating with some velocity

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:24.220
v. If you wish, it also
has a mass M. There are all

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:25.720
kinds of [? parameters. ?]
How many?

00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:29.490
Mass, charge,
radius, and velocity.

00:47:29.490 --> 00:47:30.100
Here we go.

00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:35.250
We have our solid ring
of charge rotating,

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:39.030
and we want to figure out
something quite fundamental,

00:47:39.030 --> 00:47:41.470
which is the origin
of this principle.

00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:46.300
We said, you really
never see spins directly.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.960
You never see this intrinsic
angular momentum directly.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.280
You see magnetic moments.

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.800
But then actually
what happens is

00:47:55.800 --> 00:47:58.310
that there's a
universal relation

00:47:58.310 --> 00:48:00.615
between magnetic moments
and angular momentum.

00:48:00.615 --> 00:48:04.370
This is a key
concept in physics.

00:48:04.370 --> 00:48:05.890
Maybe you've seen it before.

00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:07.080
Maybe you haven't.

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:11.540
Probably you might
have seen that in 802.

00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.040
So how does that go?

00:48:13.040 --> 00:48:16.020
Let's calculate the
magnetic moment.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:22.830
So the current is the
linear charge density

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:23.650
times the velocity.

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:32.760
The linear charge density
is the total charge

00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:35.705
divided by 2 pi R
times the velocity.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:41.060
Now the area, to give
the magnetic moment,

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:44.120
we'll have mu is equal
to I times the area.

00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:49.300
So it would be this
Q times 2 pi R v

00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:54.700
times the area, which
would be pi R squared.

00:48:54.700 --> 00:49:00.605
So the pi's cancel,
and we get 1/2 QvR.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:10.550
OK.

00:49:10.550 --> 00:49:14.510
1/2 QvR, and that's
fine and interesting.

00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:20.230
But OK, depends on the radius,
depends on the velocity.

00:49:20.230 --> 00:49:26.200
So here is the magnetic moment
is supposed to be going up.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.730
But what else is going up?

00:49:27.730 --> 00:49:31.020
The angular momentum of
this thing is also going up.

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:35.026
So what is the magnitude
of the angular momentum L?

00:49:35.026 --> 00:49:36.476
L is angular momentum.

00:49:39.700 --> 00:49:43.690
Well, it's the mass
times the momentum--

00:49:43.690 --> 00:49:47.970
it's the mass momentum
cross R, so MvR.

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:58.270
The momentum of R
cross p for each piece,

00:49:58.270 --> 00:50:02.910
contributes the same, so you
just take the total momentum.

00:50:02.910 --> 00:50:06.260
This really is 0, but add
them up little by little,

00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.270
and you've got your MvR.

00:50:11.050 --> 00:50:22.780
So here you have vR, so here
you put 1/2 Q over M MvR.

00:50:25.330 --> 00:50:38.600
And you discover that mu
is equal to 1/2 Q over M L.

00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:49.430
So maybe write it better--
Q over 2M L. I'm sorry,

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:50.835
this is the normal.

00:50:50.835 --> 00:50:54.710
The M shouldn't change, M.

00:50:54.710 --> 00:50:59.680
And I box this relation
because an interesting thing

00:50:59.680 --> 00:51:00.440
has happened.

00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:04.510
All kinds of incidentals
have dropped out.

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:08.090
Like the velocity
has dropped out.

00:51:08.090 --> 00:51:11.140
The radius has
dropped out as well.

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.140
So if I have one
ring with this radius

00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:16.390
and another ring
with a bigger radius,

00:51:16.390 --> 00:51:19.740
the relation between
mu and L is the same,

00:51:19.740 --> 00:51:23.090
as long as it's rotating
with the same speed.

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:26.900
So this is actually
a universal relation.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.330
It is not just true
for a little ring.

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:33.790
It's true for a solid sphere
or any solid object axially

00:51:33.790 --> 00:51:35.880
symmetric.

00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:36.830
It would be true.

00:51:36.830 --> 00:51:43.030
You could consider any object
that is axially symmetric,

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:45.870
and then you start considering
all the little rings that

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:46.710
can be built.

00:51:46.710 --> 00:51:49.340
And for every ring,
mu over L is the same,

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:51.880
and they all point in
the same direction.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:56.220
Therefore, it's true under
very general grounds.

00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.790
And that is a very
famous relation.

00:51:59.790 --> 00:52:03.770
So now you could
speculate that, indeed,

00:52:03.770 --> 00:52:12.390
the reason that a particle may
have a magnetic moment if it's

00:52:12.390 --> 00:52:15.610
made by a little ball of
charge that is rotating.

00:52:15.610 --> 00:52:18.900
But that was exactly what
Pauli didn't like, of course.

00:52:21.928 --> 00:52:24.600
And you would like
to see what's really

00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.980
happening with particles.

00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:31.770
So when you think of a true
quantum mechanical particle,

00:52:31.770 --> 00:52:37.550
let's think of a particle
in general, a solid particle

00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:38.110
rotating.

00:52:38.110 --> 00:52:43.160
We'll change the name to S
for spin angular momentum.

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.480
Because that little part,
this is just one particle.

00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.920
We're not thinking of
that little particle

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.700
going around a nucleus.

00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.310
We're thinking of that
little particle rotating.

00:52:55.310 --> 00:52:57.620
So this is a little piece
of that little particle

00:52:57.620 --> 00:52:59.270
that is rotating.

00:52:59.270 --> 00:53:08.640
So you could ask,
if, for the electron,

00:53:08.640 --> 00:53:12.150
for example, is
it true that mu is

00:53:12.150 --> 00:53:17.595
equal to e over 2 mass of
the electron times its spin?

00:53:22.030 --> 00:53:28.040
So this would be a vindication
of this classical analysis.

00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:34.770
It might be that it's
related in this way.

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:48.910
So actually, it's
not quite true,

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:53.080
but let's still improve
this a little bit.

00:53:53.080 --> 00:54:00.590
In terms of units, we like to
put an h bar here and a 2Me.

00:54:00.590 --> 00:54:05.700
And put spin here, angular
momentum, divided by h.

00:54:05.700 --> 00:54:11.960
Because this has no
units, h bar has the units

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:17.000
of angular momentum, x times p.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.390
It's the same units, so
units of angular momentum.

00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:24.430
So h bar would be convenient.

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:33.270
So that over here, you would
have units of a dipole moment,

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:38.300
or magnetic moment,
magnetic moment units.

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:47.810
So what does happen
for the electron?

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:52.810
Well, it's almost
true, but not quite.

00:54:52.810 --> 00:54:57.680
In fact, what you get is
that you need a fudge factor.

00:54:57.680 --> 00:55:00.700
The fudge factor
is that, actually,

00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:02.800
for elementary
particles, you have

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.980
a g, which is a constant,
which is the fudge factor,

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:15.850
e h bar 2 over M of the
particle S over h bar.

00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:19.410
Sometimes called
the Lande factor.

00:55:19.410 --> 00:55:22.410
You must put a number there.

00:55:22.410 --> 00:55:28.140
Now, the good thing is
that the number sometimes

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:31.030
can be calculated and predicted.

00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:34.100
So when people did
this, they figured out

00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:38.950
that for the electron the
number is actually a 2.

00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:46.210
So for the electron, g of
the electron is equal to 2.

00:55:46.210 --> 00:55:49.770
Now that, you would say,
cannot be an accident.

00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:54.720
It's twice what you would
predict sort of classically.

00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:59.250
And the Dirac equation,
the relativistic equation

00:55:59.250 --> 00:56:02.010
of the electron that
you have not studied yet

00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:07.200
but you will study soon,
predicts this g equal to 2.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:08.880
It was considered
a great success

00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:12.670
that that equation gave the
right answer, that people

00:56:12.670 --> 00:56:16.400
understood that this
number was going to be 2.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:19.670
So for the electron, this is 2.

00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:25.210
So this quantity is called--
it's a magnetic dipole

00:56:25.210 --> 00:56:32.210
moment-- is called mu
B for Bohr magneton.

00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:44.330
So how big is a mu B?

00:56:44.330 --> 00:56:51.880
It's about 9.3 times 10 to
the minus 24 joules per tesla.

00:56:55.454 --> 00:56:56.380
AUDIENCE: Professor.

00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:57.520
PROFESSOR: Yes?

00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:58.966
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:58.966 --> 00:57:01.376
So where exactly does
the fudge factor come in?

00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:05.112
Is it just merely
because [INAUDIBLE]?

00:57:05.112 --> 00:57:05.820
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:57:05.820 --> 00:57:11.590
So the classical
analysis is not valid.

00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.800
So it's pretty invalid, in fact.

00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:19.530
You see, the picture
of an electron,

00:57:19.530 --> 00:57:22.480
as of today, is that
it's a point particle.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:27.200
And a point particle
literally means no size.

00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:30.880
The electron is not a
little ball of charge.

00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:32.740
Otherwise, it would have parts.

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:34.970
So an electron is
a point particle.

00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:38.250
Therefore, a point particle
cannot be rotating and have

00:57:38.250 --> 00:57:39.020
a spin.

00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:43.670
So how does the electron
manage to have spin?

00:57:43.670 --> 00:57:45.720
That you can't
answer in physics.

00:57:45.720 --> 00:57:47.590
It just has it.

00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:51.640
Just like a point particle
that has no size can have mass.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:54.670
How do you have mass
if you have no size?

00:57:54.670 --> 00:57:56.130
You get accustomed to the idea.

00:57:56.130 --> 00:57:58.550
The mathematics
says it's possible.

00:57:58.550 --> 00:58:00.420
You don't run into trouble.

00:58:00.420 --> 00:58:06.510
So this particle has no size,
but it has an angular spin,

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:09.070
angular momentum, as if
it would be rotating.

00:58:09.070 --> 00:58:12.520
But it's definitely not the
case that it's rotating.

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:17.420
And therefore, this 2 confirms
that it was a pointless idea

00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:19.260
to believe that
it would be true.

00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:22.720
Nevertheless, kind
of unit analyses

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.770
or maybe some truth to the
fact that quantum mechanics

00:58:26.770 --> 00:58:29.290
changes classical mechanics.

00:58:29.290 --> 00:58:32.580
Turns out that it's
closely related.

00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:36.910
For the proton, for example, the
magnetic moment of the proton

00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:40.510
is quite complicated as well
because the proton is made out

00:58:40.510 --> 00:58:43.110
of quarks that are
rotating inside.

00:58:43.110 --> 00:58:47.070
And how do you get
the spin of the proton

00:58:47.070 --> 00:58:48.790
and the magnetic
moment of the proton?

00:58:48.790 --> 00:58:50.000
It's complicated.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.560
The neutron, that has no
charge, has a magnetic moment,

00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.450
because somehow the quarks
inside arrange in a way

00:58:58.450 --> 00:59:01.900
that their angular momentum
doesn't quite cancel.

00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.690
So for example, the value
for a neutron, I believe,

00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:12.390
is minus 2.78 or
something like that.

00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:14.770
It's a strange number.

00:59:14.770 --> 00:59:19.070
Another thing that is sort of
interesting that is also true

00:59:19.070 --> 00:59:22.390
is that this mass is
the mass of a particle.

00:59:22.390 --> 00:59:25.250
So if you're talking
about the magnetic moment

00:59:25.250 --> 00:59:28.530
of the proton or
the neutron, it's

00:59:28.530 --> 00:59:31.740
suppressed with respect to
the one of the electron.

00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:34.580
The electron one is much bigger
because, actually, the mass

00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.440
shows up here.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:40.860
So for a neutron or a
proton, the magnetic moment

00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:44.210
is much, much smaller.

00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:48.560
So, in fact, for an
electron then, you

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.870
would have the following.

00:59:49.870 --> 01:00:01.720
Mu is equal to minus g, which
is 2, mu B S bar over h.

01:00:01.720 --> 01:00:04.280
And actually, we
put the minus sign

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:07.820
because the electron
has negative charge.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:12.270
So the magnetic moment
actually points opposite.

01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:16.120
If you rotate this way, the
angular momentum is always up.

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.770
But if you rotate this
way and you're negative,

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:21.740
it's as if the current goes
in the other direction.

01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:25.871
So this is due to the fact
that the electron is negatively

01:00:25.871 --> 01:00:26.370
charged.

01:00:26.370 --> 01:00:28.870
And that's the final expression.

01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:38.765
So OK, so that's the general
story with magnetic moments.

01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:45.360
So the next thing is,
how do magnetic moments

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.530
react when you have
magnetic fields?

01:00:49.530 --> 01:00:54.710
So that is something
that you can calculate,

01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:57.790
or you can decide if
you have a picture.

01:00:57.790 --> 01:01:03.650
For example, if you have a
loop of charge like this,

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:10.050
and you have magnetic field
lines that go like this,

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:11.795
they diverge a bit.

01:01:15.830 --> 01:01:18.220
Let me see you use
your right-hand rule

01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:20.950
and tell me whether
that loop of current

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:22.925
will feel a force up or down.

01:01:26.936 --> 01:01:31.090
I'll give you 30 seconds,
and I take a vote.

01:01:31.090 --> 01:01:32.880
Let's see how we're
doing with that.

01:01:39.547 --> 01:01:43.280
And I'll prepare these
blackboards in the meantime.

01:01:59.420 --> 01:02:00.310
All right.

01:02:00.310 --> 01:02:03.060
Who votes up?

01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:03.560
Nobody.

01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.503
Who votes down?

01:02:05.503 --> 01:02:06.405
Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

01:02:06.405 --> 01:02:08.640
Down, exactly.

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.150
How do you see down?

01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:14.250
Well, one way to see this,
look at the cross-section.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:18.980
You would have this
wire here like that.

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:22.870
The current is coming in on this
side and going out this way.

01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:26.470
Here you have the field lines
that go through those two

01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:33.570
edges, and the magnetic
field is like that.

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:38.550
And the force goes like I cross
B. So I goes in, B goes out.

01:02:38.550 --> 01:02:42.720
The force must be like
that, a little bit of force.

01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:46.700
In this one, I cross
B would be like that,

01:02:46.700 --> 01:02:48.160
a little bit of force.

01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:49.070
Yep.

01:02:49.070 --> 01:02:52.105
Has a component down because
the field lines are diverging.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.920
So what is the force
really given by?

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:05.540
The force is given
by the gradient

01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:14.490
of mu dot B. This is derived in
E&M. I will not derive it here.

01:03:14.490 --> 01:03:17.490
This is not really the
point of this course.

01:03:17.490 --> 01:03:21.310
But you can see that
it's consistent.

01:03:21.310 --> 01:03:26.080
This is saying that the force
goes in the direction that

01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.810
makes mu dot B grow the fastest.

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:34.830
Now mu, in this case, is up.

01:03:34.830 --> 01:03:40.170
So mu dot B is positive, because
mu and the magnetic field

01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.550
go in the same direction.

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:43.610
So mu dot b is positive.

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:47.720
So the force will be towards
the direction-- that's

01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:51.220
what the gradient is--
that this becomes bigger.

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:55.210
So it becomes bigger here,
because as the field lines come

01:03:55.210 --> 01:03:58.570
together, that means
stronger magnetic field.

01:03:58.570 --> 01:04:03.550
And therefore, mu dot B would be
larger, so it's pointing down.

01:04:03.550 --> 01:04:07.790
If you have a magnetic
field that is roughly

01:04:07.790 --> 01:04:11.010
in the z direction, there
will be a simplification,

01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:13.020
as we will see very soon.

01:04:13.020 --> 01:04:16.480
So what did Stern
and Gerlach do?

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:21.110
Well, they were working
with silver atoms.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:25.410
And silver atoms
have 47 electrons,

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:30.070
out of which 46 fill up
the levels and equal 1,

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:33.620
2, 3, and 4.

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:41.010
Just one lone electron, a 5s
electron, the 47th electron,

01:04:41.010 --> 01:04:45.810
it's a lonely electron that
is out in a spherical shell,

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:49.760
we know now with zero
orbital angular momentum.

01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:52.130
It's an S state.

01:04:52.130 --> 01:04:58.110
And therefore, throwing silver
atoms through your apparatus

01:04:58.110 --> 01:05:03.320
was pretty much the same
thing as throwing electrons,

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.810
because all these
other electrons

01:05:05.810 --> 01:05:08.440
are tied up with each other.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:11.970
We know now one has
spin up, one spin down.

01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:15.710
Nothing contributes, no
angular momentum as a whole.

01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:19.090
And then you have this
last electron unpaired.

01:05:19.090 --> 01:05:21.060
It has a spin.

01:05:21.060 --> 01:05:23.066
So it's like throwing spins.

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:32.820
So moreover, throwing spins,
as far as we're concerned,

01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.510
Stern and Gerlach wouldn't care.

01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:39.370
Because of these relations,
it's throwing in dipole moments.

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:42.910
And they would care about
that because magnetic fields

01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:46.740
push dipole moments up or down.

01:05:46.740 --> 01:05:52.690
Therefore, what is the
apparatus these people had?

01:05:52.690 --> 01:06:01.760
It was sort of like
this, with an oven,

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.580
and you produce
some silver atoms

01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:10.450
that come out as a gas,
a collimating slit.

01:06:14.490 --> 01:06:19.490
Then you put axes
here-- we put axes just

01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:22.060
to know the components
we're talking about.

01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:39.850
And then there's magnets,
some sort of magnet like this,

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:41.780
and the screen over there.

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:49.285
So basically, this
form of this magnet

01:06:49.285 --> 01:06:53.330
that I've tried to draw there,
although it's not so easy, if I

01:06:53.330 --> 01:06:56.945
would take a cross-section
it would look like this.

01:07:01.740 --> 01:07:03.866
So the magnetic
field has a gradient.

01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:09.330
The lines bend a bit,
so there's a gradient

01:07:09.330 --> 01:07:10.445
of the magnetic field.

01:07:10.445 --> 01:07:16.870
And it's mostly in the z
direction, so z direction

01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:18.280
being pointed out here.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:19.590
So there's the magnetic field.

01:07:19.590 --> 01:07:21.800
The beam then comes here.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.045
And the question is, what
do you get on this screen?

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:33.278
Now, I have it a little too low.

01:07:33.278 --> 01:07:37.110
The beam comes there
and goes through there.

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:41.840
So the analysis that
we would have to do

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:47.100
is basically an
analysis of the forces.

01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:52.020
And relatively, we
don't care too much.

01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:55.870
The fact is that
there's basically,

01:07:55.870 --> 01:07:59.190
because the magnetic field
is mostly in the z direction

01:07:59.190 --> 01:08:01.570
and varies in z
direction, there will

01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:04.940
be a force basically
in the z direction.

01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:05.790
Why is that?

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:07.720
Because you take
this, and you say,

01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:15.870
well, that's roughly mu
z Bz, because it's mostly

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:18.120
a magnetic field
in the z direction.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:24.670
And mu is a constant, so it's
basically gradient of Bz.

01:08:24.670 --> 01:08:26.029
Now, that's a vector.

01:08:26.029 --> 01:08:30.160
But we're saying also
most of the gradient of Bz

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:37.109
is in the z direction,
so it's basically dBz dz.

01:08:45.569 --> 01:08:47.830
Now, there is some
bending of the lines,

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:50.750
so there's a little bit of
gradient in other directions.

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:54.220
But people have gone
through the analysis,

01:08:54.220 --> 01:08:57.790
and they don't matter for
any calculation that you do.

01:08:57.790 --> 01:09:00.830
They actually average out.

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:04.850
So roughly, this gradient
is in the z direction.

01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:09.040
I'm sorry, the gradient is
supposed to be a vector.

01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:11.600
So you get a force
in the z direction.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.350
And therefore, the thing
that people expected

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.870
was the following.

01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:24.200
You know, here comes one atom,
and it has its magnetic moment.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:28.420
Well, they've all been boiling
in this oven for a while.

01:09:28.420 --> 01:09:29.740
They're very disordered.

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:33.055
Some have a z component of
magnetic-- the magnetic moment

01:09:33.055 --> 01:09:37.029
is pointing like that, so they
have some component, some down.

01:09:37.029 --> 01:09:37.880
Some are here.

01:09:37.880 --> 01:09:39.569
They have no component.

01:09:39.569 --> 01:09:44.260
It's all Boltzmann distributed
all over the directions.

01:09:44.260 --> 01:09:49.870
Therefore, you're going
to get a smudge like this.

01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:53.240
Some ones are going to be
deflected a lot because they

01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:57.030
have lots of z
component of angular

01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:00.240
momentum or z magnetic moment.

01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:04.720
Others are going to
be deflected little.

01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.590
So this was the
classical expectation.

01:10:07.590 --> 01:10:11.080
And the shock was that
you got, actually,

01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:16.010
one peak here, an empty
space, and another peak there.

01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:17.950
That was called
space quantization.

01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:26.790
Stern and Gerlach worked
with a magnetic field

01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:35.190
that was of about 0.1
tesla, a tenth of a tesla.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:38.600
And in their experiment,
the space quantization,

01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.680
this difference, was
1/5 of a millimeter.

01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:51.110
So not that big, but
it was a clear thing.

01:10:51.110 --> 01:10:53.700
It was there.

01:10:53.700 --> 01:11:00.350
So everybody was confused.

01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:04.340
They thought it was the orbital
spin, angular momentum that

01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:06.600
somehow had been measured.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:08.880
At the end of the
day, that was wrong.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.370
It couldn't have been that.

01:11:10.370 --> 01:11:13.400
People understood the Bohr
atom, realized, no, there's

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.220
no angular momentum there.

01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:17.810
The idea of the spin
came back, and you

01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:20.820
would have to do a
calculation to determine

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:23.030
what is the value of the spin.

01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:28.960
So the exact factor took
a while to get it right.

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:36.660
But with the idea that mu z is
equal to minus 2 Bohr magenton

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:39.250
Sz over h bar, which
we wrote before.

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:46.900
Well, mu z, if you
know the strength

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:51.350
of your magnetic field, you
can calculate the deflections.

01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:53.030
You know what mu B is.

01:11:53.030 --> 01:11:57.040
So therefore, you get
the value for Sz over h.

01:11:57.040 --> 01:12:00.540
And experiments
suggested that Sz over h

01:12:00.540 --> 01:12:04.165
was either plus or minus 1/2.

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:15.280
And this kind of particle, it
has Sz over h bar equal plus

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:20.970
or minus 1/2, is called
the spin-1/2 particle.

01:12:20.970 --> 01:12:26.400
So again, from this equation,
this can be measured.

01:12:29.930 --> 01:12:34.725
And you then use this,
and you get this value.

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:43.160
So the experiment is
a little confusing.

01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.760
Why did this happen?

01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:48.020
And how do we think of
it quantum mechanically?

01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:53.340
Now 804 sort of began
with these kind of things.

01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:56.680
And you know by now
that what's happening

01:12:56.680 --> 01:13:01.090
is the following, that somehow,
mathematically, every state is

01:13:01.090 --> 01:13:04.000
a superposition of a
spin up and a spin down.

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.410
So every particle
that goes there

01:13:06.410 --> 01:13:10.230
has half of its brain in the
spin up and half of its brain

01:13:10.230 --> 01:13:11.630
in the spin down.

01:13:11.630 --> 01:13:14.170
And then as it goes
through the magnetic field,

01:13:14.170 --> 01:13:17.990
this thing splits, but each
particle is in both beams

01:13:17.990 --> 01:13:19.880
still.

01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:22.140
And they just have
this dual existence

01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:25.130
until there's a screen
and there's detectors.

01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:27.460
So they have to decide
what happens, and then

01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:33.260
either collapses in the
top beam or lower beam.

01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:35.630
Nothing happens until
you put the screen.

01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:38.790
That's what we think now
is the interpretation

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:39.980
of this experiment.

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:43.720
But let's use the
last few minutes

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:50.440
to just write this in terms of
boxes and get the right ideas.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:57.590
So instead of drawing
all that stuff,

01:13:57.590 --> 01:14:01.620
we'll draw a little
box called a z hat

01:14:01.620 --> 01:14:04.690
box, a Stern-Gerlach apparatus.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:10.350
In comes a beam, out
would come two beams,

01:14:10.350 --> 01:14:17.150
Sz equal h bar over 2 and
Sz equal minus h bar over 2.

01:14:17.150 --> 01:14:19.980
And the convention is
that the plus goes up

01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:21.840
and the minus goes
down, which I think

01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:24.555
is probably consistent
with that drawing.

01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:29.980
And that's the
Stern-Gerlach apparatus.

01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:34.150
It measures Sz, and
it splits the beam.

01:14:34.150 --> 01:14:36.510
Each particle goes
into both beams

01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:38.520
until there's a
device that measures

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.270
and decides where you go.

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:44.440
So you can do the
following arrangements.

01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:50.590
So here's arrangement number 1,
a Stern-Gerlach device with z.

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:54.000
Then you block the
lower one and let

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:03.650
the top one go as Sz
equal h bar over 2.

01:15:03.650 --> 01:15:08.710
And then you put another
Stern-Gerlach machine, z hat,

01:15:08.710 --> 01:15:12.220
that has two outputs.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:15.270
And then you ask,
what's going to happen?

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:19.680
And the experiment can be
done and, actually, there's

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:23.720
nothing here coming out, and
all the particles come out here

01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:26.250
with Sz equal h bar over 2.

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:34.280
What are we going
to learn from this?

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.710
In our picture of
quantum mechanics,

01:15:36.710 --> 01:15:39.450
we're going to think
of this as there

01:15:39.450 --> 01:15:43.700
are states of the
electron that have--

01:15:43.700 --> 01:15:46.610
and I will write
them with respect

01:15:46.610 --> 01:15:51.950
to z-- they have
plus h bar over 2

01:15:51.950 --> 01:15:58.060
and states that have
minus h bar over 2.

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:03.590
And what we will think is that
these are really old basis

01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:09.080
states, that any other state,
even one that points along x,

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.950
is a superposition of those two.

01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:15.030
This is a very incredible
physical assumption.

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:20.310
It's saying this system is a
2-dimensional complex vector

01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:24.850
space, two vectors, two
unit, two basis vectors.

01:16:24.850 --> 01:16:28.860
And from those two, all linear
combinations that are infinite

01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:33.860
represent all possible
spin configurations.

01:16:33.860 --> 01:16:36.090
And what is this saying?

01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:41.060
Well, as we will
translate it into algebra,

01:16:41.060 --> 01:16:45.480
we will say that, look,
here is a state plus.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:49.380
And when you try to measure,
if it had any minus component,

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:50.740
it had nothing.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:55.410
So we will state that as
saying that these states are

01:16:55.410 --> 01:16:56.330
orthogonal.

01:16:56.330 --> 01:17:00.590
The minus state and the plus
state have zero overlap.

01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:05.950
They are orthogonal
basis states.

01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:10.910
And, for example, well, you
could also do it this way.

01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:12.800
That would also be 0.

01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.540
And you could also
say that z plus

01:17:17.540 --> 01:17:23.370
and z plus is 1, because
every state that came in

01:17:23.370 --> 01:17:26.040
as a plus came out as a plus.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.910
They had perfect overlap.

01:17:27.910 --> 01:17:32.130
So these are two
orthonormal basis vectors.

01:17:32.130 --> 01:17:34.395
That's what this
seems to suggest.

01:17:34.395 --> 01:17:36.940
And it's a little
strange, if you think,

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:41.950
because there's a
clash between arrows

01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:45.300
and the notion of
orthonormality.

01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:48.110
In 3-dimensional
vectors, you think

01:17:48.110 --> 01:17:50.489
of this vector being
orthogonal to this.

01:17:50.489 --> 01:17:52.030
But you wouldn't
think of this vector

01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:54.280
as being orthogonal to that one.

01:17:54.280 --> 01:18:00.130
And here is the spin is up,
and this is the spin down.

01:18:00.130 --> 01:18:01.600
And those two are orthogonal.

01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:03.450
You say, no, they're
anti-parallel.

01:18:03.450 --> 01:18:04.780
They're not orthogonal.

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.820
No, they are orthogonal.

01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:12.070
And that's the endlessly
confusing thing about spin-1/2.

01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:16.830
So these states, their pictures
of the spins are arrows.

01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:20.020
But don't think that those
arrows and the dot product

01:18:20.020 --> 01:18:23.370
give you the orthogonality,
because this is up and down.

01:18:23.370 --> 01:18:26.280
If you would be doing the
dot product of an up and down

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.000
vector, you would not get 0.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.870
But this is 0.

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:31.860
Then you do the
following experiment.

01:18:36.550 --> 01:18:38.390
So let's do the next one.

01:18:42.820 --> 01:18:47.680
And the next one is,
again, the z filter.

01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:50.920
Take this one, block it.

01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:53.025
Then you put an x filter.

01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:58.550
And what actually happens
is that you would get states

01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:05.570
with Sx, now, h bar over 2 and
Sx equal minus h bar over 2,

01:19:05.570 --> 01:19:07.070
because it's an x filter.

01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:10.490
The magnetic field is a
line in the x direction.

01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:16.630
Now, all these things have
Sz equal h bar over 2.

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:18.860
And what happens
in the experiment

01:19:18.860 --> 01:19:21.860
is that 50% of the
particles come out here

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.790
and 50% come out there.

01:19:23.790 --> 01:19:29.280
So a spin state
along the x direction

01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:33.340
has some overlap with a spin
state along the z direction.

01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:38.190
Normal vectors, a z vector and
an x vector, are orthogonal.

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:40.470
Not here for spins.

01:19:40.470 --> 01:19:44.350
The spin pointing in the z
and the spin pointing in the x

01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:46.100
are not orthogonal states.

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.890
They have overlaps.

01:19:47.890 --> 01:19:53.690
So this means that, for example,
the x plus state and the z

01:19:53.690 --> 01:19:58.990
plus state have an overlap.

01:19:58.990 --> 01:20:02.840
This is notations that-- we're
going to be precise later.

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:11.170
But the same thing with the x
minus state, it has an overlap,

01:20:11.170 --> 01:20:14.140
and somehow they're
about the same.

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:21.920
Finally, the last experiment
is this, z hat, block again,

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.640
x hat, but this time block one.

01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:32.040
So here is a state with Sx
equals minus h bar over 2.

01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.830
Here is a state with
Sz equal h bar over 2.

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:38.400
And now you put the
z machine again.

01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:44.160
And what happens?

01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:46.330
Well, there's two options.

01:20:46.330 --> 01:20:48.520
People who were inventing
quantum mechanics

01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.190
no wonder thought about them.

01:20:50.190 --> 01:20:55.290
Here they could say, look,
I filtered this thing,

01:20:55.290 --> 01:21:01.100
and now all these electrons
have Sz equal h bar over 2.

01:21:01.100 --> 01:21:06.340
And now all these electrons have
Sx equal minus h bar over 2.

01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:08.830
Maybe, actually,
all these electrons

01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:13.420
have both Sz equal
h over 2 and that

01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.090
because I filtered it twice.

01:21:15.090 --> 01:21:16.850
So it maybe satisfies both.

01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:20.530
So if all these electrons
would have Sz equals

01:21:20.530 --> 01:21:23.690
h over 2 and this,
then you would only

01:21:23.690 --> 01:21:26.080
get something from the top one.

01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:28.350
But no, that's not what happens.

01:21:28.350 --> 01:21:30.330
You get in both.

01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:36.870
So somehow, the memory of
these states coming from Sz

01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:39.260
equals h over 2
has been destroyed

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:41.020
by the time it
turned into a state

01:21:41.020 --> 01:21:44.130
with Sx equal minus h over 2.

01:21:44.130 --> 01:21:48.970
And a state cannot have
simultaneously this and that.

01:21:48.970 --> 01:21:54.840
That's two properties, because
you get 50% here and 50% there.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.760
So we'll discuss next
time a little more

01:21:57.760 --> 01:22:00.500
about these relations
and how can the states

01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:04.480
be related, the ones
that we use as the basis

01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:07.590
vectors and all the
others along x and others

01:22:07.590 --> 01:22:09.790
that we could build
some other way.

01:22:09.790 --> 01:22:10.430
All right.

01:22:10.430 --> 01:22:11.340
See you next week.

01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:18.110
There's office hours today, 5:00
to 6:00, Monday, 4:30 to 5:30.

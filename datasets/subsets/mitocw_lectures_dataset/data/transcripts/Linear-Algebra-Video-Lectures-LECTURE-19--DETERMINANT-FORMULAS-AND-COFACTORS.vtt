00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.310
OK, this is the second
lecture on determinants.

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:15.260
There are only three.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.270
With determinants it's a
fascinating, small topic

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.480
inside linear algebra.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.000
Used to be determinants
were the big thing,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.780
and linear algebra was the
little thing, but they --

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.510
those changed, that
situation changed.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.170
Now determinants is one specific
part, very neat little part.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.740
And my goal today is to find
a formula for the determinant.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.480
It'll be a messy formula.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.570
So that's why you didn't
see it right away.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.090
But if I'm given
this n by n matrix

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.890
then I use those
entries to create

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.450
this number, the determinant.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.620
So there's a formula for it.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.250
In fact, there's another
formula, a second formula using

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.129
something called cofactors.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.910
So you'll -- you have to
know what cofactors are.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.590
And then I'll apply
those formulas

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.410
for some, some matrices
that have a lot of zeros

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.430
away from the three diagonals.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.220
OK.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.690
So I'm shooting now for a
formula for the determinant.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.470
You remember we started with
these three properties, three

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.610
simple properties,
but out of that we

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.440
got all these amazing facts,
like the determinant of A B

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.210
equals determinant of A
times determinant of B.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.280
But the three facts were --

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.950
oh, how about I just
take two by twos.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.320
I know, because everybody here
knows, the determinant of a two

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.770
by two matrix, but let's get
it out of these three formulas.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.940
OK, so here's my, my
two by two matrix.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.160
I'm looking for a formula
for this determinant.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.810
a b c d, OK.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.220
So property one, I know what
to do with the identity.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.900
Right?

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.190
Property two allows
me to exchange rows,

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.940
and I know what to do then.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.570
So I know that that
determinant is one.

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.280
Property two allows me
to exchange rows and know

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.400
that this determinant
is minus one.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.970
And now I want to use property
three to get everybody,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.210
to get everybody.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.850
And how will I do that?

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:41.500
OK.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.600
So remember that if I keep
the second row the same,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.590
I'm allowed to use
linearity in the first row.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.750
And I'll just use
it in a simple way.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.020
I'll write this vector
a b as a 0 + 0 b.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.750
So that's one step using
property three, linearity

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.361
in the first row when the
second row's the same.

00:03:12.361 --> 00:03:12.860
OK.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:15.650
But now you can guess
what I'm going to do next.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.870
I'll -- because I'd like to --

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.040
if I can make the
matrices diagonal,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.730
then I'm clearly there.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.810
So I'll take this one.

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.470
Now I'll keep the first row
fixed and split the second row,

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:32.510
so that'll be an a 0
and I'll split that

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:39.660
into a c 0 and, keeping that
first row the same, a 0 d.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.920
I used, for this
part, linearity.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.600
And now I'll -- whoops, that's
plus because I've got more

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.710
coming.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.530
This one I'll do the same.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.710
I'll keep this
first row the same

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.320
and I'll split c d
into c 0 and 0 d.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.170
OK.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.310
Now I've got four
easy determinants,

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.250
and two of them are --

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.460
well, all four are
extremely easy.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:12.020
Two of them are so easy as
to turn into zero, right?

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:17.500
Which two of these determinants
are zero right away?

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.670
The first guy is zero.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.720
Why is he zero?

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.520
Why is that determinant
nothing, forget him?

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.090
Well, it has a column of zeros.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.630
And by the -- well, so
one way to think is, well,

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.170
it's a singular matrix.

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.150
Oh, for, for like forty-eight
different reasons,

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.060
that determinant is zero.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.100
It's a singular matrix
that has a column of zeros.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:44.570
It's, it's dead.

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.900
And this one is
about as dead too.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.191
Column of zeros.

00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:49.690
OK.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.650
So that's leaving
us with this one.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.370
Now what do I -- how do
I know its determinant,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.910
following the rules?

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.660
Well, I guess one of the
properties that we actually got

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.120
to was the determinant of that
-- diagonal matrix, then --

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.340
so I, I'm finally getting to
that determinant is the a d.

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.030
And this determinant is what?

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.010
What's this one?

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.120
Minus -- because I would use
property two to do a flip

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:29.220
to make it c b, then property
three to factor out the b,

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.370
property c to
factor out the c --

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.320
the property again to factor
out the c, and that minus,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.860
and of course finally I got the
answer that we knew we would

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:42.110
get.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.810
But you see the method.

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.250
You see the method, because it's
method I'm looking for here,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.190
not just a two by two answer
but the method of doing --

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:59.220
now I can do three by threes
and four by fours and any size.

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.470
So if you can see the method
of taking each row at a time --

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:07.880
so let's -- what would
happen with three by threes?

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.190
Can we mentally do
it rather than I

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.730
write everything on the
board for three by threes?

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:16.900
So what would we do if
I had three by threes?

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.360
I would keep rows two
and three the same

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:25.540
and I would split the first
row into how many pieces?

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.570
Three pieces.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:30.050
I'd have an A zero
zero and a zero B zero

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.670
and a zero zero C or
something for the first row.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.250
So I would instead of going from
one piece to two pieces to four

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:48.560
pieces, I would go from one
piece to three pieces to --

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.650
what would it be?

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.290
Each of those three,
would, would it be nine?

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.280
Or twenty-seven?

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.940
Oh yeah, I've actually
got more steps,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.510
right.

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.520
I'd go to nine but then I'd have
another row to straighten out,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.200
twenty-seven.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.630
Yes, oh God.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.610
OK, let me say this again then.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.170
If I -- if it was three
by three, I would --

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.830
separating out one
row into three pieces

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.820
would give me three, separating
out the second row into three

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.230
pieces, then I'd be up to nine,
separating out the third row

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:24.560
into its three pieces, I'd be
up to twenty-seven, three cubed,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.290
pieces.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:28.470
But a lot of them would be zero.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:31.350
So now when would
they not be zero?

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:35.480
Tell me the pieces
that would not be zero.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.450
Now I will write
the non-zero ones.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:39.790
OK, so I have this matrix.

00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:43.520
I think I have to
use these, start

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:50.590
using these double symbols here
because otherwise I could never

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:52.970
do n by n.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.080
OK.

00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.220
OK.

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.075
So I split this up like crazy.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.730
A bunch of pieces are zero.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.790
Whenever I have a column of
zeros, I know I've got zero.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.620
When do I not have zero?

00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:12.950
When do I have -- what is
it that's like these guys?

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:16.330
These are the survivors,
two survivors there.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.080
So my question
for three by three

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.990
is going to be what
are the survivors?

00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:22.760
How many survivors are there?

00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.290
What are they?

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:28.010
And when do I get a survivor.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:30.780
Well, I would get a survivor --

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.730
for example, one
survivor will be

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.960
that one times that one times
that one, with all zeros

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.340
everywhere else.

00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.320
That would be one survivor.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.330
a one one zero zero
zero a two two zero zero

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.030
zero a three three.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:50.990
That's like the a d survivor.

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:53.970
Tell me another survivor.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:58.560
What other thing -- oh,
now here you see the clue.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.750
Now can -- shall I just
say the whole clue?

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.920
That I'm having --

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:10.460
the survivors have one entry
from each row and each column.

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:14.430
One entry from each
row and column.

00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:16.760
Because if some
column is missing,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.600
then I get a singular matrix.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.960
And that, that's
one of these guys.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.470
See, you see what
happened with --

00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:27.480
this guy?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:32.950
Column one never
got used in 0 b 0 d.

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.620
So its determinant was
zero and I forget it.

00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.510
So I'm going to forget
those and just put --

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:42.750
so tell me one more that
would be a survivor?

00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:44.960
Well -- well,
here's another one.

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:50.690
a one one zero zero -- now OK,
that's used up row -- row one

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.800
is used.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.420
Column one is already
used so it better be zero.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.850
What else could I have?

00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:03.050
Where could I pick the guy --
which column shall I use in row

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:04.360
two?

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.070
Use column three, because
here if I use column --

00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:10.140
here I used column
one and row one.

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:12.710
This was like the column --

00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:15.950
numbers were one two
three, right in order.

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:23.140
Now the column numbers are going
to be one three, column three,

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.070
and column two.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:29.620
So the row numbers are
one two three, of course.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:32.100
The column numbers are some --

00:10:32.100 --> 00:10:35.550
OK, some permutation
of one two three,

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:38.880
and here they come in
the order one three two.

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.060
It's just like having
a permutation matrix

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:46.330
with, instead of the
ones, with numbers.

00:10:46.330 --> 00:10:50.940
And actually, it's very close
to having a permutation matrix,

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:55.550
because I, what I do eventually
is I factor out these numbers

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:57.630
and then I have got.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:59.520
So what is that
determinant equal?

00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.120
I factor those
numbers out and I've

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:05.400
got a one one times a two
two times a three three.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:08.020
And what does this
determinant equal?

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:09.530
Yeah, now tell me the, this --

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:13.140
I mean, we're really getting
to the heart of these formulas

00:11:13.140 --> 00:11:13.690
now.

00:11:13.690 --> 00:11:16.800
What is that determinant?

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.400
By the laws of -- by,
by our three properties,

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.920
I can factor these out, I
can factor out the a one one,

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:27.780
the a two three,
and the a three two.

00:11:27.780 --> 00:11:28.980
They're in separate rows.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.960
I can do each row separately.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:35.230
And then I just have to
decide is that plus sign

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:37.530
or is that a minus sign?

00:11:37.530 --> 00:11:42.640
And the answer is it's a minus.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:43.490
Why minus?

00:11:43.490 --> 00:11:47.350
Because these is
one row exchange

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:49.780
to get it back to the identity.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.740
So that's a minus.

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:53.960
Now I through?

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.455
No, because there
are other ways.

00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.060
What I'm really
through with, what

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.510
I've done, what I've,
what I've completed

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:08.110
is only the part where
the a one one is there.

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:11.810
But now I've got parts
where it's a one two.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:18.820
And now if it's a one two that
row is used, that column is

00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:19.610
used.

00:12:19.610 --> 00:12:21.260
You see that idea?

00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:25.380
I could use this row and column.

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.070
Now that column is used,
that column is used,

00:12:28.070 --> 00:12:31.300
and this guy has to be
here, a three three.

00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:33.190
And what's that determinant?

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:38.510
That's an a one two times an a
two one times an a three three,

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:42.510
and does it have
a plus or a minus?

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:43.820
A minus is right.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:45.600
It has a minus.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.690
Because it's one
flip away from an id-

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.730
from the, regular, the right
order, the diagonal order.

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:54.200
And now what's the other
guy with a -- with,

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:57.470
a one two up there?

00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:59.240
I could have used this row.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:05.080
I could have put this guy
here and this guy here.

00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:05.580
Right?

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.730
You see the whole deal?

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:14.030
Now that's an a one two,
a two three, a three one,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:17.970
and does that go with
a plus or a minus?

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:19.720
Yeah, now that takes
a minute of thinking,

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.210
doesn't it, because one
row exchange doesn't get it

00:13:23.210 --> 00:13:24.760
in line.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.300
So what is the answer for this?

00:13:26.300 --> 00:13:28.090
Plus or minus?

00:13:28.090 --> 00:13:32.120
Plus, because it
takes two exchanges.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.920
I could exchange rows one and
three and then two and three.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:40.360
Two exchanges makes
this thing a plus.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.300
And then finally we have --
we're going to have two more.

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:43.800
OK.

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:52.770
Zero zero a one three, a two
one zero zero, zero a three two

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.160
zero.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.720
And one more guy.

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:00.820
Zero zero a one
three, zero a two

00:14:00.820 --> 00:14:06.750
two zero, A three one zero zero.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:08.870
And let's put down
what we get from those.

00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:14.160
An a one three, an a two one,
and an a three two, and I

00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.650
think that one is a plus.

00:14:16.650 --> 00:14:21.510
And this guys is a minus because
one exchange would put it --

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:24.864
would order it.

00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:25.655
And that's a minus.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.510
All right, that has
taken one whole board

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.030
just to do the three by three.

00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:37.630
But do you agree
that we now have

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:42.590
a formula for the
determinant which

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.080
came from the three properties?

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.440
And it must be it.

00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:53.090
And I'm going to
keep that formula.

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:57.870
That's a famous -- that three
by three formula is one that

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:01.570
if, if the cameras will follow
me back to the beginning here,

00:15:01.570 --> 00:15:07.130
I, I get the ones with the plus
sign are the ones that go down

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.800
like down this way.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.390
And the ones with
the minus signs

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:13.940
are sort of the ones
that go this way.

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.440
I won't make that precise.

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.700
For two reasons, one,
it would clutter up

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.970
the board, and second reason,
it wouldn't be right for four

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:26.300
by fours.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:29.540
For four by four, let
me just say right away,

00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:33.360
four by four matrix --
the, the cross diagonal,

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.190
the wrong diagonal happens
to come out with a plus sign.

00:15:38.190 --> 00:15:39.800
Why is that?

00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:43.600
If I have a four by
four matrix with ones

00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:50.080
coming on the counter diagonal,
that determinant is plus.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:50.980
Why?

00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.980
Why plus for that guy?

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:59.720
Because if I exchange
rows one and four and then

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.850
I exchange rows two and
three, I've got the identity,

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.590
and I did two exchanges.

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:10.880
So this down to this, like,
you know, down toward Miami

00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.330
and down toward LA stuff is,
like, three by three only.

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:16.830
OK.

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:25.185
But I do want to get now --

00:16:25.185 --> 00:16:27.310
I don't want to go through
this for a four by four.

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:34.280
I do want to get now
the general formula.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:39.570
So this is what I refer to in
the book as the big formula.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:43.140
So now this is the big
formula for the determinant.

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:47.380
I'm asking you to make a jump
from two by two and three

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.260
by three to n by n.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:52.220
OK, so this will
be the big formula.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:07.310
That the determinant of A is
the sum of a whole lot of terms.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.550
And what are those terms?

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:12.490
And, and is it a
plus or a minus sign,

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:14.869
and I have to tell you
which, which it is,

00:17:14.869 --> 00:17:18.520
because this came in -- in
the three by three case,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:20.140
I had how many terms?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:21.859
Six.

00:17:21.859 --> 00:17:25.630
And half were plus
and half were minus.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:30.570
How many terms are you
figuring for four by four?

00:17:30.570 --> 00:17:36.520
If I get two terms in the
two by two case, three --

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:41.760
six terms in the three by three
case, what's that pattern?

00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.210
How many terms in the
four by four case?

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.320
Twenty-four.

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.715
Four factorial.

00:17:52.430 --> 00:17:53.750
Why four factorial?

00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:56.200
This will be a sum
of n factorial terms.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.530
Twenty-four, a
hundred and twenty,

00:18:01.530 --> 00:18:05.570
seven hundred and twenty,
whatever's after that.

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:06.580
OK.

00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:08.945
Half plus and half minus.

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:14.720
And where do those n
factorial -- terms come from?

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:17.310
This is the moment to
listen to this lecture.

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.110
Where do those n
factorial terms come from?

00:18:20.110 --> 00:18:23.690
They come because the first,
the guy in the first row

00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:26.940
can be chosen n ways.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:33.390
And after he's chosen, that's
used up that, that column.

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:38.440
So the one in the second row
can be chosen n minus one ways.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.360
And after she's chosen,
that second column has been

00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:43.160
used.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:46.650
And then the one in the third
row can be chosen n minus two

00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:49.140
ways, and after it's chosen --

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:52.330
notice how I'm getting
these personal pronouns.

00:18:52.330 --> 00:18:53.510
But I've run out.

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:59.570
And I'm not willing to
stop with three by three,

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:02.370
so I'm just going to
write the formula down.

00:19:02.370 --> 00:19:07.470
So the one in the first row
comes from some column alpha.

00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:10.670
I don't know what alpha is.

00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.600
And the one in the --

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:14.410
I multiply that by somebody
in the second row that comes

00:19:14.410 --> 00:19:16.530
from some different column.

00:19:16.530 --> 00:19:19.470
And I multiply that by somebody
in the third row who comes

00:19:19.470 --> 00:19:21.850
from some yet different column.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:25.269
And then in the n-th
row, I don't know what --

00:19:25.269 --> 00:19:26.310
I don't know how to draw.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.570
Maybe omega, for last.

00:19:29.570 --> 00:19:32.170
And the whole point
is then that --

00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.510
that those column
numbers are different,

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:40.990
that alpha, beta, gamma, omega,
that set of column numbers

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:50.100
is some permutation,
permutation of one to n.

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:54.830
It, it, the n column
numbers are each used once.

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:57.570
And that gives us
n factorial terms.

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:02.130
And when I choose
a term, that means

00:20:02.130 --> 00:20:04.850
I'm choosing somebody
from every row and column.

00:20:04.850 --> 00:20:10.300
And then I just -- like the way
I had this from row and column

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:14.160
one, row and column two, row
and column three, so that --

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:19.080
what was the alpha beta stuff
in that, for that term here?

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:22.360
Alpha was one, beta was
two, gamma was three.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:26.180
The permutation was, was
the trivial permutation, one

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.140
two three, everybody
in the right order.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:31.750
You see that formula?

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:37.120
It's -- do you see why I
didn't want to start with that

00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.930
the first day, Friday?

00:20:39.930 --> 00:20:42.470
I'd rather we understood
the properties.

00:20:42.470 --> 00:20:44.920
Because out of this
formula, presumably I

00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.720
could figure out all
these properties.

00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.900
How would I know that the
determinant of the identity

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:56.630
matrix was one, for example,
out of this formula?

00:20:56.630 --> 00:20:59.680
Why is -- if A is
the identity matrix,

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:04.080
how does this formula
give me a plus one?

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.160
You see it, right?

00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:10.440
Because, because almost
all the terms are zeros.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:15.450
Which term isn't zero, if,
if A is the identity matrix?

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:18.501
Almost all the terms are zero
because almost all the As are

00:21:18.501 --> 00:21:19.000
zero.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.070
It's only, the only
time I'll get something

00:21:21.070 --> 00:21:25.270
is if it's a one one times a
two two times a three three.

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:28.590
Only, only the,
only the permutation

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:32.650
that's in the right order
will, will give me something.

00:21:32.650 --> 00:21:34.400
It'll come with a plus sign.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.490
And the determinant of
the identity is one.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.910
So, so we could go back
from this formula and prove

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:41.710
everything.

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:45.460
We could even try to prove
that the determinant of A B

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.860
was the determinant of A
times the determinant of B.

00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:51.070
But like next week we would
still be working on it,

00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:54.600
because it's not --

00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.500
clear from -- if I took A B,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.030
my God.

00:21:57.030 --> 00:21:57.530
You know --.

00:21:57.530 --> 00:22:02.210
The entries of A B would
be all these pieces.

00:22:02.210 --> 00:22:06.630
Well, probably, it's probably
-- historically it's been done,

00:22:06.630 --> 00:22:09.131
but it won't be repeated
in eighteen oh six.

00:22:09.131 --> 00:22:09.630
OK.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:16.480
It would be possible probably
to see, why the determinant of A

00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.190
equals the determinant
of A transpose.

00:22:18.190 --> 00:22:21.154
That was another, like,
miracle property at the end.

00:22:21.154 --> 00:22:22.820
That would, that
would, that's an easier

00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.290
one, which we could find.

00:22:25.290 --> 00:22:26.200
OK.

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.460
Is that all right
for the big formula?

00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:33.160
I could take you
then a, a typical --

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.070
let me do an example.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:39.280
Which I'll just create.

00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.410
I'll take a four by four matrix.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:46.820
I'll put some, I'll put some
ones in and some zeros in.

00:22:46.820 --> 00:22:47.350
OK.

00:22:47.350 --> 00:22:48.530
Let me --

00:22:48.530 --> 00:22:52.690
I don't know how many to
put in, to tell the truth.

00:22:52.690 --> 00:22:54.100
I've never done this before.

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.260
I don't know the
determinant of that matrix.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:05.380
So like mathematics is being
done for the first time

00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:07.772
in, in front of your eyes.

00:23:07.772 --> 00:23:08.730
What's the determinant?

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:15.210
Well, a lot of -- there
are twenty-four terms,

00:23:15.210 --> 00:23:17.700
because it's four by four.

00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.460
Many of them will be
zero, because I've

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.430
got all those zeros there.

00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:25.350
Maybe the whole
determinant is zero.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:29.390
I mean, I -- is that
a singular matrix?

00:23:29.390 --> 00:23:33.470
That possibility
definitely exists.

00:23:33.470 --> 00:23:37.620
I could, I could, So one way
to do it would be elimination.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:42.090
Actually, that would probably
be a fairly reasonable way.

00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.440
I could use elimination,
so I could use --

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.760
go back to those properties,
that -- and use elimination,

00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.990
get down, eliminate it down,
do I have a row of zeros

00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.020
at the end of elimination?

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.230
The answer is zero.

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:58.320
I was thinking, shall
I try this big formula?

00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.390
OK.

00:23:59.390 --> 00:24:00.810
Let's try the big formula.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:08.190
How -- tell me one way I can go
down the matrix, taking a one,

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:13.250
taking a one from every row and
column, and make it to the end?

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.640
So it's -- I get
something that isn't zero.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.280
Well, one way to do it, I could
take that times that times

00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.360
that times that times that.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.510
That would be one and,
and, and I just said,

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:25.990
that comes in with what sign?

00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.820
Plus.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:28.690
That comes with a plus sign.

00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:32.600
Because, because
that permutation --

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:35.160
I've just written
the permutation

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:38.530
about four three two
one, and one exchange

00:24:38.530 --> 00:24:40.900
and a second exchange,
two exchanges

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.540
puts it in the correct order.

00:24:46.750 --> 00:24:51.620
Keep walking away, don't....

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.550
OK, we're executing a
determinant formula here.

00:24:54.550 --> 00:25:07.900
Uh as long as it's not
periodic, of course.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:11.290
If he comes back I'm in --

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:11.790
no.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:13.620
All right, all right.

00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:16.260
OK, so that would
give me a plus one.

00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:22.700
All right.

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:24.240
Are there any others?

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.610
Well, of course we
see another one here.

00:25:26.610 --> 00:25:29.840
This times this times this
times this strikes us right

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.340
away.

00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:34.470
So that's the order
three, the order --

00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:37.450
let me make a little
different mark here.

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.520
Three two one four.

00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:45.330
And is that a plus or a
minus, three two one four?

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:52.950
Is that, is that permutation
a plus or a minus permutation?

00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:53.827
It's a minus.

00:25:53.827 --> 00:25:54.660
How do you see that?

00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:59.640
What exchange shall I do to
get it in the right order?

00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.480
If I exchange the one and the
three I'm in the right orders,

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:05.120
took one exchange to do it,
so that would be a plus --

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:07.040
that would be a minus one.

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.700
And now I don't know if
there're any more here.

00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:10.280
Let's see.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.670
Let me try again
starting with this.

00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:18.360
Now I've got to pick somebody
from -- oh yeah, see,

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.400
you see what's happening.

00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:24.900
If I I start there, OK,
column three is used.

00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.680
So then when I go to next
row, I can't use that,

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.850
I must use that.

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:30.810
Now columns two
and three are used.

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.370
When I come to this
row I must use that.

00:26:33.370 --> 00:26:34.700
And then I must use that.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:38.280
So if I start there, this
is the only one I get.

00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:42.220
And similarly, if I start there,
that's the only one I get.

00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.280
So what's the determinant?

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.420
What's the determinant?

00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:47.920
Zero.

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.940
The determinant is
zero for that case.

00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.080
Because we, we were able to
check the twenty-four terms.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.850
Twenty-two of them were zero.

00:26:57.850 --> 00:26:59.290
One of them was plus one.

00:26:59.290 --> 00:27:01.100
One of them was minus one.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:04.600
Add up the twenty-four
terms, zero is the answer.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:05.120
OK.

00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:07.136
Well, I didn't know
it would be zero, I --

00:27:07.136 --> 00:27:08.760
because I wasn't,
like, thinking ahead.

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.700
I was a little scared, actually.

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:18.360
I said, that,
apparition went by.

00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.420
So and I don't know if
the camera caught that.

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:23.970
So whether the rest
of the world will

00:27:23.970 --> 00:27:27.450
realize that I was in danger
or not, we don't know.

00:27:27.450 --> 00:27:29.674
But anyway, I guess
he just wanted

00:27:29.674 --> 00:27:31.590
to be sure that we got
the right answer, which

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:33.260
is determinant zero.

00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:36.060
And then that makes me
think, OK, the matrix

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:41.110
must be, the matrix
must be singular.

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.020
And then if the
matrix is singular,

00:27:43.020 --> 00:27:46.000
maybe there's another way to see
that it's singular, like find

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.225
something in its null space.

00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:54.190
Or find a combination of
the rows that gives zero.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:58.320
And like what d- what, what
combination of those rows

00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.070
does give zero.

00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:05.980
Suppose I add rows
one and rows three.

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.660
If I add rows one and
rows three, what do I get?

00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.990
I get a row of all ones.

00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:15.340
Then if I add rows two and rows
four I get a row of all ones.

00:28:15.340 --> 00:28:19.370
So row one minus row two
plus row three minus row four

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.280
is probably the zero row.

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.490
It's a singular matrix.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:27.330
And I could find something in
its null space the same way.

00:28:27.330 --> 00:28:29.720
That would be a combination
of columns that gives zero.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:32.040
OK, there's an example.

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:32.950
All right.

00:28:32.950 --> 00:28:36.840
So that's, well, that
shows two things.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.280
That shows how we get
the twenty-four terms

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:41.700
and it shows the great
advantage of having

00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:43.810
a lot of zeros in there.

00:28:43.810 --> 00:28:45.830
OK.

00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:48.970
So we'll use this big
formula, but I want to pick --

00:28:48.970 --> 00:28:53.710
I want to go onward
now to cofactors.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.030
Onward to cofactors.

00:28:56.030 --> 00:29:03.330
Cofactors is a way of breaking
up this big formula that

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:08.910
connects this n by n -- this
is an n by n determinant that

00:29:08.910 --> 00:29:13.880
we've just have a formula
for, the big formula.

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.450
So cofactors is a way to connect
this n by n determinant to,

00:29:18.450 --> 00:29:22.270
determinants one smaller.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:24.170
One smaller.

00:29:24.170 --> 00:29:29.430
And the way we want to do it
is actually going to show up in

00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:30.260
this.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:34.470
Since the three by three is the
one that we wrote out in full,

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:38.060
let's, let me do
this three by --

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:43.350
so I'm talking about cofactors,
and I'm going to start again

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.420
with three by three.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.220
And I'm going to take
the, the exact formula,

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:55.690
and I'm just going to
write it as a one one --

00:29:55.690 --> 00:29:59.540
this is the determinant
I'm writing.

00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.360
I'm just going to say
a one one times what?

00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:04.760
A one one times what?

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.830
And it's a one one times
a two two a three three

00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:12.230
minus a two three a three two.

00:30:15.410 --> 00:30:22.640
Then I've got the a one
two stuff times something.

00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:26.910
And I've got the a one
three stuff times something.

00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:29.500
Do you see what I'm doing?

00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.990
I'm taking our big formula
and I'm saying, OK,

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:37.320
choose column --

00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.380
out of the first row,
choose column one.

00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:43.520
And take all the possibilities.

00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.240
And those extra
factors will be what

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:51.800
we'll call the cofactor, co
meaning going with a one one.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:55.890
So this in parenthesis
are, these are in,

00:30:55.890 --> 00:30:57.930
the cofactors are in parens.

00:31:02.210 --> 00:31:05.660
A one one times something.

00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.820
And I figured out what that
something was by just looking

00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:14.290
back -- if I can walk back
here to the, to the a one one,

00:31:14.290 --> 00:31:17.440
the one that comes down the
diagonal minus the one that

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:19.830
comes that way.

00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:24.570
That's, those are the two,
only two that used a one one.

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.970
So there they are, one
with a plus and one with a

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:28.240
minus.

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.800
And now I can write in the --

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.100
I could look back and
see what used a one two

00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.740
and I can see what
used a one three,

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.770
and those will give
me the cofactors

00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.920
of a one two and a one

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:41.650
three.

00:31:41.650 --> 00:31:45.770
Before I do that, what's this
number, what is this cofactor?

00:31:48.310 --> 00:31:52.080
What is it there that's
multiplying a one one?

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.360
Tell me what a two two a three
three minus a two three a three

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.310
two is, for this --

00:31:59.310 --> 00:32:00.340
do you recognize that?

00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.500
Do you recognize --

00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.780
let's see, I can --
and I'll put it here.

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.520
There's the a one one.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.160
That's used column one.

00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:17.645
Then there's -- the other
factors involved these other

00:32:17.645 --> 00:32:18.145
columns.

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:27.360
This row is used.

00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.140
This column is used.

00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:32.870
So this the only things
left to use are these.

00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:36.250
And this formula
uses them, and what's

00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:39.860
the, what's the cofactor?

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:42.420
Tell me what it is because
you see it, and then --

00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:47.150
I'll be happy you see what
the idea of cofactors.

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:50.010
It's the determinant
of this smaller guy.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.400
A one one multiplies
the determinant

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:56.590
of this smaller guy.

00:32:56.590 --> 00:33:02.840
That gives me all the a one
one part of the big formula.

00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:03.540
You see that?

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.500
This, the determinant
of this smaller guy

00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:10.540
is a two two a three three
minus a two three a three two.

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:14.050
In other words, once I've
used column one and row

00:33:14.050 --> 00:33:20.850
one, what's left is all the
ways to use the other n-1

00:33:20.850 --> 00:33:25.130
columns and n-1
rows, one of each.

00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:28.970
All the other -- and that's the
determinant of the smaller guy

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.880
of size n-1.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.710
So that's the whole
idea of cofactors.

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.150
And we just have to remember
that with determinants we've

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:39.900
got pluses and minus
signs to keep straight.

00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:43.260
Can we keep this
next one straight?

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:45.090
Let's do the next one.

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:51.640
OK, the next one will
be when I use a one two.

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:55.330
I'll have left -- so I can't
use that column any more,

00:33:55.330 --> 00:34:02.710
but I can use a two one and a
two three and I can use a three

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:06.330
one and a three three.

00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:08.850
So this one gave me a one
times that determinant.

00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:13.760
This will give me a one two
times this determinant, a two

00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:24.690
one a three three minus
a two three a three one.

00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:27.969
So that's all the stuff
involving a one two.

00:34:27.969 --> 00:34:32.360
But have I got the sign right?

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:35.280
Is the determinant of that
correctly given by that

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.510
or is there a minus sign?

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:39.520
There is a minus sign.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.929
I can follow one of these.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:43.080
If I do that times
that times that,

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:45.046
that was one that's
showing up here,

00:34:45.046 --> 00:34:47.420
but it should have showed --
it should have been a minus.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.675
So I'm going to build that
minus sign into the cofactor.

00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.390
So, so the cofactor
-- so I'll put,

00:35:01.390 --> 00:35:04.110
put that minus sign in here.

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.180
So because the cofactor
is going to be strictly

00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:09.900
the thing that multiplies
the, the factor.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:12.570
The factor is a one two,
the cofactor is this,

00:35:12.570 --> 00:35:15.620
is the parens, the
stuff in parentheses.

00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:18.590
So it's got the
minus sign built in.

00:35:18.590 --> 00:35:23.960
And if I did -- if I went on
to the third guy, there w-

00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:26.920
there'll be this and
this, this and this.

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:28.410
And it would take
its determinant.

00:35:28.410 --> 00:35:31.790
It would come out
plus the determinant.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:34.960
So now I'm ready to
say what cofactors are.

00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:40.620
So this would be a plus and a
one three times its cofactor.

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:45.940
And over here we had plus a
one one times this determinant.

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:49.400
But and there we had the a
one two times its cofactor,

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.310
but the -- so the point is
the cofactor is either plus

00:35:53.310 --> 00:35:56.320
or minus the determinant.

00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:57.990
So let me write that
underneath them.

00:35:57.990 --> 00:36:00.750
What is the, what are cofactors?

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:09.650
The cofactor if any
number aij, let's say.

00:36:13.500 --> 00:36:18.630
This is, this is all the terms
in the, in the big formula that

00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:20.260
involve aij.

00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:25.490
We're especially interested
in a1j, the first row, that's

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:28.790
what I've been talking about,
but any row would be all right.

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:30.650
All right, so --

00:36:30.650 --> 00:36:32.900
what terms involve aij?

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:42.563
So -- it's the determinant
of the n minus one matrix --

00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:51.470
with row i, column j erased.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:00.900
So it's the, it's a
matrix of size n-1 with --

00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:05.710
of course, because I can't use
this row or this column again.

00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:08.120
So I have the matrix all there.

00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:11.400
But now it's multiplied
by a plus or a minus.

00:37:11.400 --> 00:37:14.165
This is the cofactor, and
I'm going to call that cij.

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:19.990
Capital, I use
capital c just to,

00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:22.570
just to emphasize that
these are important

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:25.850
and emphasize that
they're, they're, they're

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.591
different from the (a)s.

00:37:29.591 --> 00:37:30.090
OK.

00:37:30.090 --> 00:37:34.340
So now is it a plus
or is it a minus?

00:37:34.340 --> 00:37:36.340
Because we see
that in this case,

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:41.260
for a one one it was a plus,
for a one two I -- this is ij --

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.360
it was a minus.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:46.530
For this ij it was a plus.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.550
So any any guess on the
rule for plus or minus

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:55.650
when we see those examples,
ij equal one one or one three

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:58.070
was a plus?

00:37:58.070 --> 00:38:04.400
It sounds very like
i+j odd or even.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.170
That, that's
doesn't surprise us,

00:38:06.170 --> 00:38:07.600
and that's the right answer.

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:17.950
So it's a plus if i+j is even
and it's a minus if i+j is odd.

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:28.170
So if I go along row one
and look at the cofactors,

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:32.430
I just take those determinants,
those one smaller determinants,

00:38:32.430 --> 00:38:36.830
and they come in order plus
minus plus minus plus minus.

00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:42.120
But if I go along row two and,
and, and take the cofactors

00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:46.310
of sub-determinants, they
would start with a minus,

00:38:46.310 --> 00:38:52.520
because the two one entry,
two plus one is odd, so the --

00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:57.560
like there's a pattern plus
minus plus minus plus if it was

00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.180
five by five, but then if I was
doing a cofactor then this sign

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:06.087
would be minus plus minus
plus minus, plus minus plus --

00:39:06.087 --> 00:39:07.170
it's sort of checkerboard.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:13.040
OK.

00:39:17.551 --> 00:39:18.050
OK.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:22.220
Those are the signs that,
that are given by this rule,

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:24.540
i+j even or odd.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:27.760
And those are built
into the cofactors.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:31.030
The thing is called
a minor without th-

00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:34.400
before you've built in the sign,
but I don't care about those.

00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.700
Build in that sign and
call it a cofactor.

00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:41.950
So what's the cofactor formula?

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:42.450
OK.

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:44.240
What's the cofactor
formula then?

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:49.110
Let me come back to
this board and say,

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:50.560
what's the cofactor formula?

00:39:58.150 --> 00:40:02.840
Determinant of A is --

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.670
let's go along the first row.

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:11.480
It's a one one
times its cofactor,

00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:15.730
and then the second guy is a
one two times its cofactor,

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:19.070
and you just keep going
to the end of the row,

00:40:19.070 --> 00:40:22.750
a1n times its cofactor.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:24.840
So that's cofactor for --

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:30.780
along row one.

00:40:30.780 --> 00:40:39.030
And if I went along row I, I
would -- those ones would be

00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.530
Is.

00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:43.520
That's worth putting a box over.

00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:47.470
That's the cofactor formula.

00:40:47.470 --> 00:40:51.180
Do you see that --

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.740
actually, this would
give me another way

00:40:53.740 --> 00:41:00.150
I could have started the
whole topic of determinants.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:02.000
And some, some people
might do it this --

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.440
choose to do it this way.

00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.540
Because the cofactor
formula would

00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:09.740
allow me to build up an
n by n determinant out

00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:14.790
of n-1 sized determinants, build
those out of n-2, and so on.

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:17.740
I could boil all the
way down to one by ones.

00:41:17.740 --> 00:41:21.470
So what's the cofactor formula
for two by two matrices?

00:41:21.470 --> 00:41:23.300
Yeah, tell me that.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:24.580
What's the cofactor for us?

00:41:24.580 --> 00:41:28.620
Here is the, here is the world's
smallest example, practically,

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:32.580
of a cofactor formula.

00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:33.170
OK.

00:41:33.170 --> 00:41:35.570
Let's go along row one.

00:41:35.570 --> 00:41:39.500
I take this first guy
times its cofactor.

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:44.350
What's the cofactor
of the one one entry?

00:41:44.350 --> 00:41:48.460
d, because you strike out
the one one row and column

00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:50.460
and you're left with d.

00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:54.330
Then I take this guy,
b, times its cofactor.

00:41:54.330 --> 00:41:57.740
What's the cofactor of b?

00:41:57.740 --> 00:42:00.070
Is it c or it's --

00:42:00.070 --> 00:42:03.330
minus c, because I
strike out this guy,

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:08.360
I take that determinant, and
then I follow the i+j rule

00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:11.730
and I get a minus, I get an odd.

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:13.450
So it's b times minus c.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.120
OK, it worked.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:20.430
Of course it, it worked.

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.100
And the three by three works.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:28.200
So that's the cofactor formula,
and that is, that's an --

00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:33.230
that's a good formula to know,
and now I'm feeling like, wow,

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:38.560
I'm giving you a lot of
algebra to swallow here.

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.955
Last lecture gave
you ten properties.

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.750
Now I'm giving you --

00:42:46.750 --> 00:42:50.390
and by the way, those ten
properties led us to a formula

00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:52.480
for the determinant
which was very important,

00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:55.850
and I haven't
repeated it till now.

00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:56.820
What was that?

00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:01.140
The, the determinant is
the product of the pivots.

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.980
So the pivot formula
is, is very important.

00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.440
The pivots have all this
complicated mess already

00:43:07.440 --> 00:43:08.810
built in.

00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:11.460
As you did elimination
to get the pivots,

00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:17.670
you built in all this horrible
stuff, quite efficiently.

00:43:17.670 --> 00:43:20.680
Then the big formula with
the n factorial terms,

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.180
that's got all the
horrible stuff spread out.

00:43:24.180 --> 00:43:28.870
And the cofactor formula
is like in between.

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:35.460
It's got easy stuff times
horrible stuff, basically.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:39.840
But it's, it shows you,
how to get determinants

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.780
from smaller determinants, and
that's the application that I

00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:45.290
now want to make.

00:43:45.290 --> 00:43:51.030
So may I do one more example?

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.670
So I remember the general idea.

00:43:54.670 --> 00:43:59.360
But I'm going to use this
cofactor formula for a matrix

00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:01.230
--

00:44:01.230 --> 00:44:03.640
so here is going
to be my example.

00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:07.890
It's -- I promised in
the, in the lecture,

00:44:07.890 --> 00:44:11.090
outline at the very
beginning to do an example.

00:44:11.090 --> 00:44:12.650
And let me do --

00:44:12.650 --> 00:44:18.280
I'm going to pick
tri-diagonal matrix of ones.

00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:26.340
I could, I'm drawing
here the four by four.

00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:27.880
So this will be the matrix.

00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.260
I could call that A4.

00:44:34.830 --> 00:44:40.590
But my real idea
is to do n by n.

00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:43.100
To do them all.

00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.930
So A -- I could --

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:49.010
everybody understands
what A1 and A2 are.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:49.510
Yeah.

00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:54.900
Maybe we should just do A1
and A2 and A3 just for --

00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.400
so this is

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:57.591
What's the determinant of A1?

00:44:57.591 --> 00:44:58.090
A4.

00:44:58.090 --> 00:45:01.120
What's the determinant of A1?

00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:04.470
So, so what's the matrix
A1 in this formula?

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:06.310
It's just got that.

00:45:06.310 --> 00:45:08.850
So the determinant is one.

00:45:08.850 --> 00:45:10.950
What's the determinant of A2?

00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:14.831
So it's just got this two by
two, and its determinant is --

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:19.690
zero.

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:22.350
And then the three by three.

00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:23.800
Can we see its determinant?

00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.740
Can you take the determinant
of that three by three?

00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:32.910
Well, that's not quite so
obvious, at least not to me.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:35.060
Being three by three,
I don't know --

00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:36.710
so here's a, here's
a good example.

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:39.590
How would you do that
three by three determinant?

00:45:39.590 --> 00:45:43.160
We've got, like, n
factorial different ways.

00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.080
Well, three factorial.

00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.260
So we've got six ways.

00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:46.220
OK.

00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:49.440
I mean, one way to do it --

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.040
actually the way
I would probably

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.990
do it, being three
by three, I would use

00:45:52.990 --> 00:45:55.250
the complete the big formula.

00:45:55.250 --> 00:45:57.120
I would say, I've
got a one from that,

00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.710
I've got a zero from that, I've
got a zero from that, a zero

00:46:00.710 --> 00:46:03.140
from that, and this
direction is a minus one,

00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.410
that direction's a minus one.

00:46:04.410 --> 00:46:06.200
I believe the
answer is minus one.

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:14.220
Would you do it another way?

00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:16.400
Here's another way
to do it, look.

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.065
Subtract row three from --

00:46:18.065 --> 00:46:19.440
I'm just looking
at this three by

00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:19.939
three.

00:46:19.939 --> 00:46:22.400
Everybody's looking
at the three by three.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:25.630
Subtract row three from row two.

00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:26.930
Determinant doesn't change.

00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:29.710
So those become zeros.

00:46:29.710 --> 00:46:31.710
OK, now use the
cofactor formula.

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:33.160
How's that?

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.310
How can, how -- if this was now
zeros and I'm looking at this

00:46:36.310 --> 00:46:39.530
three by three, use
the cofactor formula.

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:42.875
Why not use the cofactor
formula along that row?

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:49.360
Because then I take that
number times its cofactor,

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:52.800
so I take this number -- let
me put a box around it --

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.030
times its cofactor, which is the
determinant of that and that,

00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.830
which is what?

00:47:02.310 --> 00:47:07.230
That two by two matrix
has determinant one.

00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.625
So what's the cofactor?

00:47:11.410 --> 00:47:15.150
What's the cofactor
of this guy here?

00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:17.220
Looking just at
this three by three.

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.470
The cofactor of that
one is this determinant,

00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:26.490
which is one times negative.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:30.370
So that's why the answer
came out minus one.

00:47:30.370 --> 00:47:31.280
OK.

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.910
So I did the three by three.

00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:35.310
I don't know if we want
to try the four by four.

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:38.090
Yeah, let's -- I guess that
was the point of my example,

00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.250
of course, so I have to try it.

00:47:41.250 --> 00:47:44.120
Sorry, I'm in a good
mood today, so you have

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:45.840
to stand for all the bad jokes.

00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:46.340
OK.

00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:47.200
OK.

00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.830
So what was the matrix?

00:47:50.830 --> 00:47:51.330
Ah.

00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:57.660
OK, now I'm ready
for four by four.

00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.720
Who wants to -- who wants
to guess the, the --

00:48:00.720 --> 00:48:04.270
I don't know, frankly,
this four by four,

00:48:04.270 --> 00:48:07.280
what's, what's the determinant.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:08.575
I plan to use cofactors.

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.310
OK, let's use cofactors.

00:48:14.310 --> 00:48:17.960
The determinant of A4 is --

00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:20.420
OK, let's use cofactors
on the first row.

00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:21.630
Those are easy.

00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:25.720
So I multiply this number,
which is a convenient one,

00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:28.240
times this determinant.

00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:31.790
So it's, it's one times
the, this three by three

00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:32.380
determinant.

00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:36.600
Now what is -- do you
recognize that matrix?

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:37.900
It's A3.

00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:41.940
So it's one times the
determinant of A3.

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:46.830
Coming along this row is a
one times this determinant,

00:48:46.830 --> 00:48:49.430
and it goes with a plus, right?

00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:50.665
And then we have this one.

00:48:53.170 --> 00:48:55.290
And what is its cofactor?

00:48:55.290 --> 00:48:58.780
Now I'm looking at, now
I'm looking at this three

00:48:58.780 --> 00:49:00.990
by three, this three
by three, so I'm

00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:04.270
looking at the three by three
that I haven't X-ed out.

00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:08.630
What is that -- oh, now
it, we did a plus or a --

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.880
is it plus this determinant,
this three by three

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:13.730
determinant, or minus it?

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:16.150
It's minus it, right,
because this is --

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:20.180
I'm starting in a one two
position, and that's a minus.

00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:22.390
So I want minus
this determinant.

00:49:22.390 --> 00:49:25.180
But these guys are X-ed out.

00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:25.680
OK.

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.260
So I've got a three by three.

00:49:27.260 --> 00:49:31.170
Well, let's use cofactors again.

00:49:31.170 --> 00:49:33.740
Use cofactors of the
column, because actually we

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.620
could use cofactors
of columns just

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:39.930
as well as rows, because,
because the transpose rule.

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:43.750
So I'll take this one, which
is now sitting in the plus

00:49:43.750 --> 00:49:46.440
position, times its
determinant -- oh!

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.773
Oh, hell.

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:53.990
What -- oh yeah, I
shouldn't have said hell,

00:49:53.990 --> 00:49:55.260
because it's all right.

00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:55.760
OK.

00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:58.230
One times the determinant.

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:00.410
What is that matrix
now that I'm taking

00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:01.920
the, this smaller one of?

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:03.420
Oh, but there's a minus, right?

00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.630
The minus came
from, from the fact

00:50:05.630 --> 00:50:10.570
that this was in the one
two position and that's odd.

00:50:10.570 --> 00:50:14.750
So this is a minus one
times -- and what's --

00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:17.130
and then this one
is the upper left,

00:50:17.130 --> 00:50:21.880
that's the one one position
in its matrix, so plus.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.910
And what's this matrix here?

00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:26.460
Do you recognize that?

00:50:26.460 --> 00:50:28.840
That matrix is --

00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:30.275
yes, please say it --

00:50:30.275 --> 00:50:30.775
A2.

00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.110
And we -- that's our
formula for any case.

00:50:39.110 --> 00:50:46.790
A of any size n is equal to the
determinant of A n minus one,

00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:49.310
that's what came from taking
the one in the upper corner,

00:50:49.310 --> 00:50:55.520
the first cofactor, minus the
determinant of A n minus two.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:02.020
What we discovered
there is true for all n.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.680
I didn't even mention
it, but I stopped taking

00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:06.610
cofactors when I got this one.

00:51:06.610 --> 00:51:08.920
Why did I stop?

00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:12.660
Why didn't I take the
cofactor of this guy?

00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:16.490
Because he's going to get
multiplied by zero, and no,

00:51:16.490 --> 00:51:18.130
no use wasting time.

00:51:18.130 --> 00:51:20.260
Or this one too.

00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:22.570
The cofactor, her
cofactor will be

00:51:22.570 --> 00:51:24.400
whatever that
determinant is, but it'll

00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.980
be multiplied by zero,
so I won't bother.

00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:30.010
OK, there is the formula.

00:51:30.010 --> 00:51:32.160
And that now tells us --

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.620
I could figure out
what A4 is now.

00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.570
Oh yeah, finally I can get A4.

00:51:37.570 --> 00:51:43.770
Because it's A3, which is minus
one, minus A2, which is zero,

00:51:43.770 --> 00:51:44.880
so it's minus one.

00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:50.090
You see how we're
getting kind of numbers

00:51:50.090 --> 00:51:51.710
that you might not have guessed.

00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:55.800
So our sequence right now is
one zero minus one minus one.

00:51:55.800 --> 00:52:00.760
What's the next one
in the sequence, A5?

00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:06.300
A5 is this minus
this, so it is zero.

00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.260
What's A6?

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:15.140
A6 is this minus
this, which is one.

00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:18.150
What's A7?

00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:21.640
I'm, I'm going to be stopped
by either the time runs out

00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:23.230
or the board runs out.

00:52:23.230 --> 00:52:27.740
OK, A7 is this minus
this, which is one.

00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:30.790
I'll stop here, because time
is out, but let me tell you

00:52:30.790 --> 00:52:32.180
what we've got.

00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:35.850
What -- these determinants
have this series,

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:39.730
one zero minus one
minus one zero one,

00:52:39.730 --> 00:52:42.760
and then it starts repeating.

00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.600
It's pretty fantastic.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:48.480
These determinants
have period six.

00:52:48.480 --> 00:52:51.880
So the determinant
of A sixty-one

00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:55.771
would be the determinant
of A1, which would be one.

00:52:55.771 --> 00:52:56.270
OK.

00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:58.190
I hope you liked that example.

00:52:58.190 --> 00:53:04.640
A non-trivial example of a
tri-diagonal determinant.

00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:05.520
Thanks.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.260
See you on Wednesday.

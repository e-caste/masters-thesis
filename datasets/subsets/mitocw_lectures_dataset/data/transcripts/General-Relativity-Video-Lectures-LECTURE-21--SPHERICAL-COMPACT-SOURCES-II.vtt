SCOTT HUGHES: So we'll pick
up where we ended last time.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.720
We're looking at the spacetime
of a compact spherical body,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.060
working in what we call
Schwarzschild coordinates.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.810
We deduce that the line
element describing this body

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.100
is of the form ds
squared equals negative e

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.350
to the 2 phi dt squared
plus tr squared divided

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:34.780
by 1 minus 2g m of r
over r plus r squared d

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.800
omega, where d omega is the
usual solid element, line

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.270
element.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.050
And let's see.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.910
Yes, the body is
described, interior,

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.090
as a perfect fluid with
particular density profile

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.537
rho of r, a pressure
profile p of r.

00:00:55.537 --> 00:00:56.620
That describes this thing.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.000
Everywhere inside some radius r
star, which gives its surface.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.260
Sorry, I just distracted myself.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.335
I don't know why I've
been calling this d omega.

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:11.780
Should be d omega squared.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:12.280
Whatever.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.380
Fluff in that notation.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.040
OK, so in the exterior of
this thing-- so for everywhere

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.770
for r greater than our
star, it is vacuum.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:26.700
There is no density.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.860
There is no pressure.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.440
Once we're outside this
thing, the only mass you see

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.730
is the mass of the star.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.890
So another way of saying this
is that when-- you know what?

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.500
I'll get to that
in just a moment.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.870
And in the exterior, the e to
the 2, 5 becomes 1 minus 2g,

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.240
that same mass over r.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.250
Everywhere in the interior,
the pressure, the function phi,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.660
and the mass r are governed
by these equations.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.130
So the mass, as I
described last time,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.913
it looks like a deceptively
simple spherical integral.

00:01:58.913 --> 00:02:00.580
But just be aware
that when you do this,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.523
you are not integrating
over a proper volume.

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:04.440
If you were to integrate
over a proper volume,

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.370
you would get a larger mass,
and such a mass, in fact,

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:10.139
does have meaning to it.

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:14.025
And the difference between
that mass and this mass

00:02:14.025 --> 00:02:15.900
tells you something
about how gravitationally

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.810
bound this object is.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.470
And these two equations
actually have a Newtonian limit

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.500
associated with them.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.280
So this is a
relativistic version

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.890
of the equation of
hydrostatic equilibrium,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.776
and this has a simple
Newtonian analog.

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:36.450
Did they drop the minus sign?

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.400
No.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.860
This has a simple
Newtonian analog,

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.810
describing the
gravitational potential

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.255
inside a fluid object.

00:02:43.255 --> 00:02:44.630
These whole things
taken together

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.390
are called the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.200
equations, or the TOV equations.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:03:01.100
So the comment I was making
was that we require m of r star

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.560
to equal m, the total
mass of this object.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.330
So that's another
condition on this.

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.155
Once you integrate up,
then you switch over

00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:09.530
to the mass, the
total mass, that

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.080
is used in the
exterior of the star.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:20.490
So if you wish to
solve these things,

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.370
what you basically do is just
choose a central density.

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:40.940
You have to choose
an equation of state,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.690
which allows you to relate
the pressure to the density.

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.830
We'll talk about that a little
bit more later in this class.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.610
And then you just
start integrating.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:04:01.510
So you basically then
integrate until you find

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.540
that the pressure equals 0.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.070
The radius at which this occurs
defines the star surface.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.810
As you integrate along,
this allows you to build up.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.990
You then build the mass profile
of the star, the pressure

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.090
profile of the star.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.830
You are building up how the phi
changes as you integrate along

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.180
the star.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:40.980
So note, if you
integrate this up,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.320
this is only defined up to
a constant of integration.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.750
And so what you
then need to do is

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.997
once you have reach the surface
of the star, you know m of r.

00:04:48.997 --> 00:04:50.580
And so what you're
going to need to do

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.030
is adjust the phi that
you found in order

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.440
to match with the exterior
solution 1 minus 2gm over r.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.750
This is an exercise you will
do on an upcoming homework

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.250
assignment.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.780
This is one of my favorite
assignments in the class.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.600
It's a really good
chance to actually see

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.540
the way we solve
these equations.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.170
And this kind of
an exercise, it's

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.900
done all the time as
part of modern research,

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.300
and you will do this for
a particularly simple kind

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.170
of equation of state.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.250
So I want to look at what some
examples of objects like this

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.010
actually look like.

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:31.230
So what we're going
to do is consider

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:34.620
an unrealistic but
instructive idealized limit.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:49.750
So imagine a star that
has rho equal constant.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.880
That is something where no
matter how hard you squeeze it,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.280
you cannot change its density.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.050
The only way that
that can happen

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.360
is if you have an object
that is infinitely stiff.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:13.200
This corresponds to a speed
of sound, which is defined

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:20.130
as dpd rho that is infinite.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.510
Now, of course,
no speed of sound

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:24.160
can actually exceed
the speed of light.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.000
So this is a somewhat
pathological object.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.350
Nonetheless, it's useful
for us for the simple reason

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:33.960
that the mass function
that emerges for this

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:34.710
is quite trivial.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.150
Rho is constant, so m of r
just goes as the volume inside

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.710
radius r times rho.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:10.620
The star then has a
total mass of 4/3 pi r,

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.370
to be pi rho r star cubed.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.290
So we know how its density
behaves, it's a constant,

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:21.720
we know how the mass
function behaves.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.205
The challenge is solving
for the pressure profile.

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:36.560
So the pressure is governed
by taking this differential

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:41.800
equation and basically
plug in that mass,

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.130
plug in this mass function,
and see what you get.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:08:17.220
So if I go and I throw
this guy in here,

00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:18.990
this is what you end up getting.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:26.816
So bear in mind as
you go through this--

00:08:26.816 --> 00:08:28.150
yeah, I see what I did here.

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:33.650
So what I do as I just
pulled out my factor of 4/3,

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:38.043
4/3 pi rho r cubed-- excuse
me, my 4/3 pi r cubed.

00:08:38.043 --> 00:08:39.460
I factor that out,
and then cancel

00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:43.070
it an overall factor of r
squared in the denominator.

00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:45.980
So this is simply
what I have over here

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.230
with this mass function defined.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:50.450
We want to solve this to find p.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.420
This is one of
those rare moments

00:08:55.420 --> 00:09:01.990
where nature and analysis
conspire and a miracle occurs.

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.240
OK, it's a somewhat messy
looking kind of solution,

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:45.760
but nonetheless, it turns
out that the pressure profile

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:48.130
is determined by-- you can
manipulate this equation.

00:09:48.130 --> 00:09:49.480
You can integrate it up.

00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.660
And this ends up describing
what the pressure

00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:59.950
profile looks like, p sub c
is the pressure at r equals 0.

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.790
We define the
surface of the star

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:11.050
as being the location at
which the pressure goes to 0.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:17.845
So by using that, so by
exploiting that condition,

00:10:17.845 --> 00:10:20.650
we can use this equation
to make a mapping

00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:24.700
between the radius of the
star and the central pressure.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.680
So it's a spherically
symmetric thing.

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:29.680
Once we have chosen
what this density is,

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.720
then there is essentially a one
parameter family of solutions.

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:37.180
We-- if we choose a central
pressure, that determines

00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:38.500
what the radius would be.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.737
Conversely, if we want to
have a particular radius,

00:10:40.737 --> 00:10:42.820
that determines what the
central pressure must be.

00:10:48.473 --> 00:10:49.890
Let's just do a
little of analysis

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:51.240
that follows from this.

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.480
So p equals 0 at
r equals r star.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.870
That defines the surface.

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:04.290
So putting all
that together, you

00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:06.210
can manipulate this
equation to find

00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:19.690
that the radius of
the star is determined

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:26.290
from the central
pressure, like so.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.760
If you prefer,
you can write this

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.490
as an equation for the
central pressure in terms

00:11:30.490 --> 00:11:31.630
of the radius of the star.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:11.510
I've written this
in terms of m tot

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.430
but m tot is, of
course, simply related

00:12:13.430 --> 00:12:16.650
to this radius-- excuse
me, to this density

00:12:16.650 --> 00:12:18.545
and the star's radius cubed.

00:12:24.895 --> 00:12:26.270
So what's the
importance of this?

00:12:26.270 --> 00:12:32.510
This is, as I've emphasized,
a fairly idealized problem.

00:12:32.510 --> 00:12:34.280
Nature will never
give us an object

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.110
that has constant density.

00:12:36.110 --> 00:12:38.810
Any object, if you give it
a little bit of a squeeze,

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.850
the density will change.

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:43.340
Causality requires
that the speed of sound

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:46.470
be less than the speed of light.

00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:51.420
So clearly, this is a
somewhat fictional limit.

00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:53.870
But we can learn something
very interesting about this.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:59.660
Notice that this formula
for the central pressure,

00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.160
it diverges for a particular
compactness of the star.

00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:11.973
So p usb c goes to infinity.

00:13:11.973 --> 00:13:13.640
Perhaps a little bit
more easily to see,

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:31.840
the denominator goes to 0, for
a certain compactness, m over r.

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.860
So let's look at the value
at which the denominator goes

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:36.360
to 0.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:49.420
So let's see.

00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.700
Move my 1 to the other side.

00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.640
Divide by 3.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:52.230
Square it.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:03.720
Rearrange terms.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:24.960
So if the ratio of this star's
total mass to its radius

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:33.130
is such that gm over
r star exceeds 4/9

00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:36.165
than the pressure diverges.

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:51.640
What this tells me is that I
cannot construct a physically

00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:57.490
allowable static object, even
using this stuff as we can

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:02.050
imagine fluid, a fluid that
has an infinite sound speed.

00:15:02.050 --> 00:15:05.560
I cannot make a star
more compact than that.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:13.090
Making it that compact requires
infinite pressure at the core.

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:19.080
This implies that stars
have a maximum compactness.

00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:59.510
We cannot have physically
realizable pressure profiles

00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.410
if--

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:01.900
and let's turn that around--

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:09.290
if the ratio of the
radius to g times

00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:14.840
the total mass is
smaller than 9/4.

00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.740
Now, this holds for the stiffest
possible fluid that we can even

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:24.030
imagine, one which the laws of
physics actually do not permit.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.390
And so one infers
from this, actually,

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.600
that this bound
basically tells me

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:34.760
that given any physical fluid,
any physically realizable star

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:37.820
that I can construct,
I must have

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:39.590
a maximum allowed compactness.

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:46.230
Putting this a little
bit more precisely

00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:51.740
brings us to a result that is
known as Buchdahl's theorem.

00:17:10.236 --> 00:17:11.819
Buchdahl's theorem
tells me that there

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:33.600
is no stable spherical
fluid configuration

00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:41.390
in which the
configuration's radius is

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:45.260
smaller than 9/4 of gm total.

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.250
For those of you who like to
put factors of c in there,

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.400
divide by c squared, and
this tells you something

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.520
that you can convert
to SI units, which

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.490
tells you how small you are
allowed to make an object.

00:18:04.390 --> 00:18:05.620
So this is clear.

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:09.460
It emerges, and very nicely, in
this idealized but unphysical

00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:10.660
fluid limit.

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.510
But it can be proven
more generally.

00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.700
You just have to make a few
assumptions about the way

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:20.980
that the pressure profile is
not singular in any place.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:31.230
Proof of this can be found in
the beautiful, old textbook

00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:39.700
by Weinberg, section 11.6.

00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:42.340
Well, when you
hear something like

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.000
that, you gotta
think to yourself,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.970
well, suppose I made a star
with some kind of a fluid

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:55.150
and I gave it a radius of
10/4 gm total over c squared.

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:57.280
And I just came along
and squeezed it.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.730
What would happen?

00:18:59.730 --> 00:19:04.750
Well, notice the word
"stable" in this definition.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:07.210
You're free to do
that, and should you

00:19:07.210 --> 00:19:11.110
do so, you would simply no
longer have a stable object.

00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:14.170
So remember, part of what
went into this analysis

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:18.580
is we were assuming the
spacetime and the fluid that

00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:20.020
is the source of
the spacetime, we

00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:21.540
were assuming
everything is static.

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.460
OK, we're making sure
everything just sits still.

00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:26.920
This is telling us you
can't do that if you

00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:28.840
want to have a star
as compact as that.

00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.930
So if you were to do
this, it would collapse.

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:34.630
It would become dynamical
and the spacetime

00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:38.820
would transition
into something else.

00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:40.425
What that something
else might be

00:19:40.425 --> 00:19:44.668
will be a topic that we
get into a little bit more

00:19:44.668 --> 00:19:46.710
after we have developed
some additional material.

00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:54.010
So let's talk a little bit.

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.270
This will help you with the
homework assignment, where

00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.860
you guys are going to construct
relativistic stellar models.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:12.600
Let's talk a little bit about
how we describe real objects.

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:20.600
They are not of
constant density,

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:26.910
and they instead
have some p that

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:30.600
is a function of the density.

00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.890
It's worth noting that in
an even more general case--

00:20:34.890 --> 00:20:36.570
this is actually
worth a brief aside--

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:46.950
the equation of state relates
the pressure to local density

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:49.140
and s, where s is the entropy.

00:20:55.210 --> 00:20:58.210
For the kind of applications
where general relativity tends

00:20:58.210 --> 00:21:01.660
to be important, for
instance, when we're studying

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.860
the stellar structure
of a neutron star,

00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.445
the fluid ends up being so
cold that you don't need

00:21:09.445 --> 00:21:10.570
to worry about the entropy.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:17.680
And where that comes
from is that when

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:21.470
I revisit my first
law of thermodynamics

00:21:21.470 --> 00:21:26.620
and I include temperature and
entropy effects, so the term

00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:30.040
that I left out in my
earlier accounting, TDS.

00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:33.100
If t is small, I can
ignore that term,

00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:34.600
and it ends up being
something where

00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.920
my local energy,
or energy density,

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.960
ends up only depending
on the pressure.

00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:43.180
But "cold" is a wiggle word.

00:21:43.180 --> 00:21:45.880
I have to define a scale
to say whether an object is

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.970
cold or hot.

00:21:48.970 --> 00:21:52.360
There's a few notes laying
this out right in my notes.

00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:53.695
Let me just sketch the key idea.

00:21:57.170 --> 00:22:03.100
Cold depends on the
fluids, and it's worth

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:05.350
noting that the kind of fluid
you're playing with here

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:07.070
tend to be made out of fermions.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:10.260
And so it depends on the
fluids' Fermi temperature.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:20.620
So the Fermi
temperature is defined

00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:27.700
as the Fermi energy normalized
to a Boltzmann factor.

00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:29.770
You get the Fermi
energy by looking

00:22:29.770 --> 00:22:35.500
at how the energy levels are
filled in your fermion fluid

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:36.976
here.

00:22:36.976 --> 00:22:39.310
I have a few additional
notes to lay out

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:43.540
the way in which you can relate
this to the local density,

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.790
the mass of each particle that
goes into this Fermi fluid.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:55.080
The punchline is that
for neutron stars, one

00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.190
of the cases where
we do, in fact,

00:22:57.190 --> 00:23:01.800
make dense general
relativistic fluid stars,

00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.430
the Fermi temperature tends
to be on the order of 10

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.970
to the 13 Kelvin, so
about 10 trillion Kelvin.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:17.940
When we actually
observe these objects,

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:23.320
they are on the order of 10 to
the 6 to 10 to the 9 Kelvin.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:27.630
So they're a factor of about
10 of the 7, 10 to the 4 to 10

00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:30.810
to the 7 times colder than
the Fermi temperature.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.170
Even though they may be a
billion Kelvin, they are cold.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.380
So we're going to use what are
called cold equations of state

00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.340
to describe these guys.

00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:48.560
So with that out of the
way, let's talk a little bit

00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.620
about the kinds of equations of
state that we will tend to use.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:01.700
So people who study the
physics of dense matter,

00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:06.050
a lot of their lives is
really down to understanding

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.998
what the equation of state of
that cold matter looks like.

00:24:08.998 --> 00:24:10.790
Some of them are
concerned about hot matter

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:13.040
as well, in which case they
might be actually worrying

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.433
about things at tens
of trillions of Kelvin.

00:24:15.433 --> 00:24:17.600
But if you're looking at
astrophysical applications,

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:20.970
you're generally interested
in the cold matter.

00:24:20.970 --> 00:24:24.950
And so they end up putting the
other very complicated models

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:31.100
using QCD and effective
field theories to try

00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:36.350
to understand how it is
that a particular fluid

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:38.690
of dense matter, how its
pressure and its density

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:39.590
are related.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:41.420
And what I'm sort of
wheeling around here

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.600
is that you generally do not
have a simple analytic form.

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.480
You wind up with some kind of
a fairly complicated function

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:51.230
that emerges from a
numerical calculation.

00:24:51.230 --> 00:24:52.610
It often ends up being--

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.143
if you are a user of
this equation of state--

00:24:55.143 --> 00:24:56.810
it ends up being in
the form of a table.

00:24:56.810 --> 00:24:58.100
So they might
actually just give you

00:24:58.100 --> 00:24:59.642
a file that's got
a bunch of numbers,

00:24:59.642 --> 00:25:02.510
which says if the
density is this,

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:03.710
then the pressure is this.

00:25:03.710 --> 00:25:06.770
And you can fit little
functions to that

00:25:06.770 --> 00:25:10.500
that allow you to look things
up and do your calculations.

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:12.260
But it's not in the
form of a clean thing

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.528
that you can write
down on the blackboard.

00:25:15.528 --> 00:25:17.820
I want something clean I can
write down the blackboard.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:25.090
So I'm going to introduce
an approximation, which

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:33.190
is useful for testing
things out, test cases,

00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:34.920
and for pedagogy.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:41.560
What we do is we
take the pressure

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:53.200
to be a power law
of the density.

00:25:53.200 --> 00:26:00.410
So what we do is we
write p equals k rho

00:26:00.410 --> 00:26:04.930
0 to the gamma, where k
and gamma are constants.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.730
A form that looks like this,
this is called a polytrope.

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:24.690
Now, the thing which I
particularly want to highlight,

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:27.990
and for those of you who
are going to do this highly

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:30.360
recommended homework
exercise, please

00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.750
pay attention at this point.

00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:39.420
This rho 0 is not--
oh, I erased it.

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.140
This rho 0 is not the rho--

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.050
oh, there it is--

00:26:43.050 --> 00:26:46.770
it's not the rho that appears
in the equation of state.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.690
It's slightly different.

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:52.200
Rho 0 is not the rho that
appears, for instance,

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.398
in the t of e equations.

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:05.130
Rho 0 is what is called
the rest mass density.

00:27:10.550 --> 00:27:14.750
It does not take into account
the fact that if I take a big--

00:27:14.750 --> 00:27:17.540
let's say I've got a big
bucket of nuclear fluid.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:21.620
So I take my bucket here
and I squeeze down on it.

00:27:24.140 --> 00:27:26.360
When I squeeze
down, its density is

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.310
going to increase,
first of all, because I

00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:30.560
have decreased the volume.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.200
So the number of
particles remains fixed,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:35.730
but I decrease the
space in there.

00:27:35.730 --> 00:27:38.930
But I have also done work on
it, because this thing exerts

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:41.540
a pressure that
opposes my squeezing.

00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:43.940
And I need to take
into account the fact

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:48.050
that the work I do in
squeezing this fluid

00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:50.030
increases the density rho.

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.320
So when you write out
your t of e equations,

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.460
rho is energy density.

00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:35.812
All forms of energy gravitate.

00:28:35.812 --> 00:28:37.520
This is just the way
people traditionally

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.690
write the equation of state.

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:42.260
This is when one is
doing nuclear physics.

00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:43.760
There's good reasons
for doing this,

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.980
but it's not the
most convenient form

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.410
for the kind of calculations
that we want to do,

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:54.280
and that you are going to want
to do, in the problem set.

00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:02.892
Fortunately, it's not too
difficult to convert, so let

00:29:02.892 --> 00:29:04.350
me describe to you
how you do that.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:23.760
So we are going to use the
first law of thermodynamics

00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.932
in a form in which I've
written now a couple times.

00:29:25.932 --> 00:29:28.140
Interestingly, it showed up
in our cosmology lecture.

00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:39.210
So my first law tells me du
equals minus pressure dv.

00:29:39.210 --> 00:29:42.080
So this is my total
energy in a fluid element

00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.202
and this is the work
done on a fluid element.

00:29:45.202 --> 00:30:01.154
So rho is equal to the amount
of energy in a fiducial volume.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.525
My rest energy-- excuse
me, my rest density--

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:15.210
is the rest energy of
every little body that

00:30:15.210 --> 00:30:20.485
goes into this per unit volume.

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:41.940
This means that I can write
du as d rho over rho 0,

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:48.133
provided I throw in an
extra factor of m rest

00:30:48.133 --> 00:30:49.300
to get the dimensions right.

00:30:51.900 --> 00:31:01.920
And I can write d
volume as d1 over rho 0,

00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:09.190
provided I throw in
that factor of m rest

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.400
to get the dimensions right.

00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:15.900
I know this looks weird
but, it's perfectly valid.

00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:21.930
So I'm going to rewrite my
first law of thermodynamics

00:31:21.930 --> 00:31:33.550
as d rho over rho 0 equals
minus pd 1 over r 0.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:49.510
Let's manipulate
that right-hand side.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.370
So I'm going to assume
this polytropic form.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:59.400
I'm going to use p equals
k rho 0 to the gamma.

00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:05.700
But I'm going to
switch that around.

00:32:05.700 --> 00:32:13.220
I'm going to write this
as rho 0 equals p over k

00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:14.580
to the power of 1 over gamma.

00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:25.320
So when I do that, I
get d rho over rho 0

00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:39.780
equals kappa 1 over gamma
over kappa pdp over p to the 1

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.330
plus 1 over gamma.

00:32:56.887 --> 00:32:57.970
Pardon me just one moment.

00:32:57.970 --> 00:32:59.710
I did something clever
in my notes here

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:02.620
and I'm just trying to
make sure I understand

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.470
what the hell I actually did.

00:33:09.670 --> 00:33:11.768
So I'm going to level with you.

00:33:11.768 --> 00:33:13.310
I've gone through
this several times.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:16.070
There's a step in the
calculation that at this point,

00:33:16.070 --> 00:33:18.475
I, for some stupid
reason, didn't write down.

00:33:18.475 --> 00:33:20.600
I'm going to trust I knew
what I was doing, though,

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.730
because I know the
final result was right.

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:26.790
You can integrate
up both sides here.

00:33:26.790 --> 00:33:28.910
Oh, I think I see what I did.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:29.410
OK.

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:33.440
So you integrate
up both sides here.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:35.440
And what you find
is this becomes rho

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:42.480
equals p over gamma
minus 1 plus a constant.

00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.510
Yeah, not 100% sure
how I actually did

00:33:48.510 --> 00:33:50.010
that, so my apologies on that.

00:33:52.957 --> 00:33:54.790
I'm going to assume I
knew what I was doing.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:58.078
I will try to fix this and
I may post an addendum here.

00:33:58.078 --> 00:34:00.120
The next step, actually,
is you want to determine

00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.120
what that constant is.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:03.090
So the way you
determine the constant

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:08.380
is you take advantage of the
fact that rho goes to rho 0.

00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:11.320
The energy density becomes
the rest energy density

00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:12.719
if there is no pressure exerted.

00:34:16.429 --> 00:34:19.070
And so this gives us our
final relationship here,

00:34:19.070 --> 00:34:26.210
which is that rho equals rho
0 plus p over gamma minus 1.

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:41.239
OK, I will double check how I
went from line 2 line 3 there,

00:34:41.239 --> 00:34:46.170
but the final thing that
I have boxed online for

00:34:46.170 --> 00:34:49.560
is, indeed, exactly what
you need to do in order

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:52.147
to build a stellar model.

00:34:52.147 --> 00:34:54.480
I guess I've been emphasizing
this is something you will

00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.480
do on an upcoming problem set.

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.980
Let me just sketch the recipe.

00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.025
I've said this verbally, but let
me just write it out explicitly

00:35:01.025 --> 00:35:01.525
here.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:09.990
So I will give you
an equation of state.

00:35:09.990 --> 00:35:18.740
You then need to pick
rho 0 at r equals 0.

00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:24.500
Using your equation of state
and using that relationship

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:28.370
between rho and rho
0, this will give you

00:35:28.370 --> 00:35:30.650
rho at the center,
pressure at the center.

00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:44.760
Set m of r at the center to 0.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:47.470
I emphasize, again, that
this may seem obvious,

00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:50.418
but it is somewhat important
that you get it right.

00:35:50.418 --> 00:35:51.960
When you do this
homework assignment,

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:53.502
I'll give you a
little hint as to how

00:35:53.502 --> 00:35:55.130
to build that in smoothly.

00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:56.130
It can be a little bit--

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.370
I don't want to say
tricky, but it's worth

00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:00.900
thinking about a little bit.

00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:10.880
Then what you do is integrate
your equations for the pressure

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:15.930
in the mass from r equals 0.

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:18.660
And this cannot be
done analytically.

00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.650
You have to use a
numerical integrator.

00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.660
If you have never used
one of these before,

00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:39.090
I will give you a
Mathematica notebook that

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:40.740
demonstrates how to use it.

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.690
This is a skill that
is worth knowing.

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:46.800
The plain truth of the matter
is that the class of problems

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:51.473
that are amenable to purely
analytic solutions, those

00:36:51.473 --> 00:36:52.140
are interesting.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:53.015
They're illustrative.

00:36:53.015 --> 00:36:54.720
They're good to work with.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.780
But they tend to be
unphysical and they're just

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.660
not the ones that are of
interest for many things

00:37:00.660 --> 00:37:03.915
that we study in science.

00:37:03.915 --> 00:37:07.770
So show while
you're doing this--

00:37:07.770 --> 00:37:10.170
this is not necessary
to make your model,

00:37:10.170 --> 00:37:11.630
but it's very useful to do this.

00:37:16.210 --> 00:37:25.960
You can also integrate,
whoops, d5 er from the center.

00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:47.690
So a caution is that you do
not know phi at r equals 0.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.480
So what you should do is just
temporarily set it equal to 0.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:52.855
And what you're going to be
doing then when you integrate

00:37:52.855 --> 00:37:55.640
this up is you will
calculate the delta phi that

00:37:55.640 --> 00:38:01.680
describes your model from the
center to the surface, which

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.850
brings me to step 4.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:27.240
When you find p equals 0,
you've hit the surface.

00:38:38.190 --> 00:38:43.340
So what we do is we use
the fact that p of r

00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:51.950
equals 0 defines the
star's radius r star.

00:38:51.950 --> 00:39:03.080
Once you've done that, you
now know the total mass

00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:05.190
and the radius.

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:07.400
So you will find, when
you're doing this,

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:11.750
that your numerical integrator
is not super well-behaved

00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:13.310
as you approach the surface.

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:16.610
This is a feature, not a bug.

00:39:16.610 --> 00:39:20.420
What's going on is that as you
begin to approach the surface,

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.270
the gradient and the
pressure gets quite steep.

00:39:23.270 --> 00:39:25.370
And so the way one
numerically integrates

00:39:25.370 --> 00:39:29.441
a set of couple equations
like this is by, essentially,

00:39:29.441 --> 00:39:34.490
if you take advantage of
the fact that an integral,

00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:36.560
it's what you get by sort
of dividing things up

00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:41.052
into tiny little pieces and
add up like little rectangles.

00:39:41.052 --> 00:39:43.010
And when you're solving
a differential equation

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:45.470
like this, you're essentially
taking the continuum solution--

00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:47.637
that you guys have learned
how to do in many cases--

00:39:47.637 --> 00:39:49.940
and you're approximating
it by a series of smaller

00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:53.300
and smaller finite steps.

00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.550
Because the gradient
in the pressure

00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:58.640
gets large as you
approach the surface,

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.410
numerical integrators
typically try

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:04.340
taking an infinite number of
infinitesimal steps, which

00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.550
makes the CPU sad, and so it's
likely to exit with an error

00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:08.780
condition.

00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.570
Generally, when
that has happened,

00:40:11.570 --> 00:40:13.520
you've gotten an
answer that's probably

00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.800
good to within a
part in a million,

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.240
or something like that.

00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.400
Fine for our purposes.

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:21.650
If you need to do something
a little bit more careful,

00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:25.760
that's a subject for a
numerical analysis class.

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.710
For us, I will
give you some hints

00:40:27.710 --> 00:40:32.100
on this when you begin
exploring these solutions.

00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:38.890
So you have an additional
boundary condition.

00:40:38.890 --> 00:40:48.100
You know by Birkhoff's theorem
that the Schwarzschild metric

00:40:48.100 --> 00:40:49.200
describes the exterior.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:41:07.500
That means gtt is minus 1 minus,
given by this for everywhere

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.600
greater than r star.

00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:18.860
This gives us a boundary
condition that phi of r star

00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:30.300
must be 1/2 log 1 minus
2m total over r star.

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:32.290
By enforcing this
boundary condition,

00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:34.620
you can go back to
your solution for phi

00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:36.660
and you can figure out
what the value at r

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:41.040
equals 0 should have been to
give you a continuous function

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.975
that matches at the surface.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.960
So that's it for
spherical stars.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.488
I look forward to you
doing these exercises.

00:41:55.488 --> 00:41:57.030
My own biases are
perhaps coming out,

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:58.155
but these are a lot of fun.

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.970
The one thing which
I will do for you,

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:07.020
and I regret that my notes
didn't really have this,

00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.855
is I will try to figure out
how on earth I went from line 2

00:42:10.855 --> 00:42:15.720
to line 3 in this
calculation over here,

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.900
going from the rest mass
density, the rest energy

00:42:18.900 --> 00:42:21.330
density to the energy density.

00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:23.460
My apologies that
that's not there.

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:26.370
All I can say is that there are
many distractions these days

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:28.512
and I overlooked that when
I was reviewing my notes

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:29.970
and preparing for
today's lectures.

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:48.780
I'd like to take this moment to
take a little bit of a detour.

00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:53.250
Let's imagine that we
have a spacetime that

00:42:53.250 --> 00:42:56.140
is Schwarzschild everywhere.

00:43:07.770 --> 00:43:25.780
In other words, it has this
form for all r, not simply

00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:27.580
the exterior of some object.

00:43:30.370 --> 00:43:34.415
We already know that this
spacetime is a vacuum solution.

00:43:43.590 --> 00:43:49.440
I know that t mu nu equals 0.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.410
Back up for a second.

00:43:50.410 --> 00:43:54.040
If I generate the
Einstein tensor for this,

00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.240
I will get identically
0, which implies

00:43:58.240 --> 00:44:01.120
that this corresponds to
a solution, which has t

00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:01.750
mu equals 0.

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.690
I also know, though,
that if I examine

00:44:07.690 --> 00:44:11.020
the behavior of radial
geodesics in the weak field

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:27.050
of this spacetime,
I find that they

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:29.000
fall towards this
like an object that

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.950
is falling towards a mass m.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:48.430
So this spacetime
appears to be something

00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:51.160
that is everywhere vacuum.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:53.890
There is nothing
in this spacetime,

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:56.050
and that nothing
has a mass of m.

00:45:19.570 --> 00:45:21.490
I hope that bothers you.

00:45:21.490 --> 00:45:24.670
That is among the sillier
things that has been

00:45:24.670 --> 00:45:26.320
said in the name of physics.

00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:29.020
That sure sounds silly.

00:45:29.020 --> 00:45:32.230
But let me remind you that we,
in fact, have seen something

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:37.180
very similar in a much less
complicated theory of physics.

00:45:50.590 --> 00:45:57.290
So if I look at the electric
field of a point charge

00:45:57.290 --> 00:45:58.070
at the origin--

00:46:03.902 --> 00:46:08.210
so that's the three vector
e is just q displacement

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:09.560
factor over r cubed.

00:46:25.390 --> 00:46:28.240
If I compute the divergence
of this electric field--

00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:36.430
the divergence, of course, tells
me about the charge density--

00:46:36.430 --> 00:46:37.250
and I get 0.

00:46:41.060 --> 00:46:45.110
So this is an electric field
that has no charge density

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:47.750
anywhere, but that
lack of charge density

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:48.890
has a total charge of q.

00:47:02.840 --> 00:47:05.750
This was something that we
easily learn how to resolve.

00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:08.360
Usually at the MIT
curriculum, this often

00:47:08.360 --> 00:47:11.540
shows up when you take
a course like 8.07.

00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:14.150
What we do is we say, oh,
all that's going on here

00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:25.080
is that I have a singular
point charge at r equals 0.

00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:27.460
So yeah, I've got
no charge density,

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.060
but I have a total charge.

00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:29.560
Fine.

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.450
We were happy with that.

00:47:31.450 --> 00:47:33.760
I want you to think of
the Schwarzschild metric

00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:37.900
as doing something
similar for gravity.

00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:42.010
There is no source
anywhere, but there is mass.

00:47:42.010 --> 00:47:44.680
Maybe there's just something
singular and a little

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.360
funny going on at r equals 0.

00:48:03.928 --> 00:48:05.470
You might be
concerned about what's

00:48:05.470 --> 00:48:06.800
happening there at r equal 0.

00:48:09.817 --> 00:48:11.275
When I say it plays
a similar role,

00:48:11.275 --> 00:48:14.260
it plays a similar role to
the pull on point charge.

00:48:28.478 --> 00:48:30.520
So there'll be nothing
there, but perhaps there's

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.710
something funny going
on at r equals 0.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.348
And by the way,
the field equations

00:48:34.348 --> 00:48:36.640
that govern gravity, my
relativistic theory of gravity,

00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:37.520
they're non-linear.

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.100
So when I say there's something
funny going on at r equals 0,

00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.550
it could be really funny.

00:48:42.550 --> 00:48:46.050
So we're not going to get
too worked up about that,

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.210
but we're just going to bear in
mind this is odd. t mu equals 0

00:48:49.210 --> 00:48:51.350
but it has mass.

00:48:51.350 --> 00:48:55.460
So let's look at the
spacetime itself.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:49:02.480
Just staring at this, we can
see two radii where it appears

00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:04.690
something odd is going on.

00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.430
So you can see right away,
lots of stuff kind of blows up

00:49:21.430 --> 00:49:26.200
and behaves badly at r equals 0.

00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:30.400
And you can also see that
your gtt and your grr,

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:37.270
they are behaving in a way that
is potentially problematic when

00:49:37.270 --> 00:49:39.397
the radius is 2gm.

00:49:39.397 --> 00:49:41.230
So you look at that and
think, yeah, there's

00:49:41.230 --> 00:49:43.280
two radii there that look sick.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:46.710
I am worried about
this spacetime.

00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:50.130
Well, we should be cautious.

00:49:50.130 --> 00:49:53.010
One of the parables that we
learned about when we studied

00:49:53.010 --> 00:49:57.210
linearized gravity is
that we can sometimes

00:49:57.210 --> 00:50:01.565
put ourselves into a coordinate
system that confuses us.

00:50:01.565 --> 00:50:02.940
When we study
linearized gravity,

00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:05.250
we found a solution
that looked everywhere.

00:50:05.250 --> 00:50:07.860
It looked like the entire
spacetime metric was radiated.

00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:10.140
And it turned out only
two of those 10 components

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:10.975
were radiative.

00:50:10.975 --> 00:50:12.600
That turned out to
be something that we

00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:16.103
were able to cure by introducing
a gauge transformation.

00:50:16.103 --> 00:50:17.770
Doing that here's a
little bit trickier,

00:50:17.770 --> 00:50:20.490
but we're going to
need to think about,

00:50:20.490 --> 00:50:23.220
how can I more clearly call
out the physical content

00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.060
of this spacetime?

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:29.670
So one of the
lessons that I hope

00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:31.740
has been imparted
in this class so far

00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:33.900
is that if you really
want understand

00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:37.320
the nature of gravity, you
want to go from the metric

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.650
to the curvature.

00:50:38.650 --> 00:50:45.900
So what I'm going to do is
assemble an invariant scalar

00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:47.262
from my curvature.

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:01.290
And I'm going to use
the Riemann tensor

00:51:01.290 --> 00:51:03.750
because I know Ricci
vanishes in this spacetime,

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:07.800
so that wouldn't give
me anything interesting.

00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:10.320
So what I'm going to do
is assemble an object.

00:51:10.320 --> 00:51:16.640
I'm going to call it capital
I. And that's just Riemann

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:19.700
contracted into Riemann.

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.860
This actually has a name.

00:51:20.860 --> 00:51:24.200
It is known as the
Kretschmann scalar.

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:25.580
And you can go in.

00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:27.590
You can work out all
these components.

00:51:27.590 --> 00:51:32.690
The gr tool that is posted
to the 8.962 website

00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:35.930
is something you
can explore with us.

00:51:35.930 --> 00:51:38.600
And this is just a number.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:47.510
Turns out to be 48 g squared
m squared over r to the sixth.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:48.590
What does this guy mean?

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:55.570
Well, in an invariant way,
it's kind of Riemann squared.

00:51:55.570 --> 00:51:58.430
Riemann tells me to go
back and think about things

00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:59.670
like geodesic deviation.

00:51:59.670 --> 00:52:01.640
It tells me about the
strength of tides.

00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:12.080
So roughly speaking, square
root I is an invariant way

00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:14.105
of characterizing tidal forces.

00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:35.020
So if you're sitting around
in the Schwarzschild spacetime

00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:38.020
and you want to give
yourself an estimate of what

00:52:38.020 --> 00:52:42.040
kind of tidal forces are
likely to act on you,

00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.520
compute the Kretschmann
scalar, take its square root,

00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.370
and that'll give you an idea
of how strong they typically

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:48.870
tend to be.

00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:58.680
So notice, when we look at this,
this tells us r equals 2gm.

00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.308
If you plug r
equals 2gm in there,

00:53:02.308 --> 00:53:03.350
nothing special about it.

00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:15.990
It's a radius just
like any other.

00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:24.280
As you go from 2.001gm
gm to 1.99999gm,

00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:25.420
it increases a little bit.

00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:27.210
Of course, it's got the 1
over r to the sixth behavior,

00:53:27.210 --> 00:53:29.190
but it's not like there's
a sudden transition,

00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:34.070
or anything particularly special
happens right at that radius.

00:53:34.070 --> 00:53:40.010
But it is hella
singular at r equals 0.

00:53:47.070 --> 00:53:51.270
So sure enough, r equals
0 is a place where

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:53.700
tidal forces blow up.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:02.340
OK, fine.

00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.590
We're going to need to do a
little bit more work then,

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:07.560
because I still want understand,
yeah, OK, r equals 2gm.

00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.710
There's no diverging
tidal forces there,

00:54:10.710 --> 00:54:13.230
but that metric still
looks wacky at that point.

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.970
So what is going on there?

00:54:19.167 --> 00:54:21.250
So let's think about the
geometry of the spacetime

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.190
in the vicinity of 2gm.

00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:33.080
So let's imagine.

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.020
Let's do the following exercise.

00:54:36.020 --> 00:54:51.150
Suppose I draw a circle
at some radius r that's

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:56.250
in the theta equals
pi over 2 plane.

00:54:56.250 --> 00:55:00.220
So I'm just sweeping
around in phi.

00:55:00.220 --> 00:55:01.320
I'm making this like so.

00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:11.220
So here is my r cosine phi axis.

00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:15.310
Here is my r sine phi axis.

00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:20.830
Here is my circle of radius r.

00:55:20.830 --> 00:55:24.490
And let's ask,
what is the surface

00:55:24.490 --> 00:55:29.090
area that this guy sweeps out
as an advance forward in time?

00:55:29.090 --> 00:55:32.970
So as this thing
goes forward in time,

00:55:32.970 --> 00:55:39.730
it sort of sweeps out a
cylinder in a spacetime diagram.

00:55:39.730 --> 00:55:45.070
Let's compute the proper area
associated with this cylinder

00:55:45.070 --> 00:55:47.800
that this circle is sweeping
out as it moves forward in time.

00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:54.900
So the surface
area of my tube, I

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:59.580
integrate from some start
time to some end time.

00:56:05.810 --> 00:56:09.800
I'm going to integrate
around in phi,

00:56:09.800 --> 00:56:12.020
and then the proper
area element that I

00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:18.258
need to do this is going
to be gtt g5 phi, the 1/2.

00:56:18.258 --> 00:56:20.800
There's actually a minus sign
in there to get the sign right.

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:21.980
Let's write it like this.

00:56:25.190 --> 00:56:28.540
To remind you how I do this,
think of this area element

00:56:28.540 --> 00:56:29.680
as a 2 volume.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.080
Go back to some of our
earlier discussion of defining

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:37.180
integrals in spacetime, and this
is the proper area associated

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:39.880
with a figure that has some
extent in time and extent

00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:40.420
in angle.

00:56:50.207 --> 00:56:51.290
So let's compute that guy.

00:57:08.650 --> 00:57:11.450
So I take my
Schwarzschild metric.

00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:17.040
g5 phi in the theta equals
pi over 2 plane is just r.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:25.110
gtt is the square root
of 1 minus 2gm over r.

00:57:25.110 --> 00:57:27.840
So the area of my
tube is going to be

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:37.840
r, integrate from my start
time to my end time, dt.

00:57:54.080 --> 00:57:54.920
So this is easy.

00:57:54.920 --> 00:58:05.790
So I get a 2 pi 2 pi r square
root 1 minus 2g m over r,

00:58:05.790 --> 00:58:08.660
and let's just say my
interval is delta t.

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:15.550
Notice what happens
as I take the radius

00:58:15.550 --> 00:58:17.590
of this thing down to 2gm.

00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:25.176
This goes to 0.

00:58:25.176 --> 00:58:28.230
This r goes to 2gm.

00:58:28.230 --> 00:58:32.910
If I go inside 2gm, I don't
even want to compute that.

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:36.950
Something has gone awry.

00:58:36.950 --> 00:58:40.590
But look, I can draw
this thing just fine.

00:58:40.590 --> 00:58:42.450
Clearly, there's
a surface there.

00:58:42.450 --> 00:58:44.447
It's got to have an
area associated with it.

00:58:44.447 --> 00:58:46.530
Why are you telling me
that the area of this thing

00:58:46.530 --> 00:58:49.860
is 0 in that limit and is
a nonsense integral if I

00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:50.940
go inside this thing?

00:58:53.664 --> 00:58:57.460
Well, what's happening
is we have uncovered

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:00.070
a coordinate singularity.

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:12.870
The time coordinate is
badly behaved as we--

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:22.215
not well-- as we approach
this radius, r equals 2gm.

00:59:28.950 --> 00:59:34.180
Let me give you an analogy
that describes, essentially--

00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:41.180
it's something that is
very similar to that tube,

00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:43.220
that world tube
that I just drew.

00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.785
But let me do it in a,
perhaps, more familiar context.

00:59:48.370 --> 00:59:54.430
Suppose I want to
draw a sphere, and all

00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:59.620
that I know about a sphere
is that it has got two

00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:04.830
coordinates to cover it, an
angle phi and an angle theta.

01:00:04.830 --> 01:00:14.420
And so I could say,
OK, here is my sphere.

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.550
Here is theta equals
0, phi equals 0.

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:25.170
Here is phi equals pi over 2.

01:00:25.170 --> 01:00:27.180
Here's phi equals pi.

01:00:27.180 --> 01:00:29.025
Pi equals 3 pi over 2.

01:00:29.025 --> 01:00:32.214
Phi equals 2 pi.

01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:33.990
Theta equals pi over 2.

01:00:33.990 --> 01:00:34.980
Theta equals pi.

01:00:38.130 --> 01:00:38.880
There's my sphere.

01:00:42.020 --> 01:00:47.650
So this chart that I've
just drawn here, it's true.

01:00:47.650 --> 01:00:53.090
This does represent
the coordinate system,

01:00:53.090 --> 01:01:01.695
but it's a horrible rendering
of a sphere's geometry.

01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:09.440
What I didn't realize when
I wrote this down here is

01:01:09.440 --> 01:01:16.070
that, in fact, at theta
equals 0 and theta equals pi,

01:01:16.070 --> 01:01:19.850
every phi value should be
collapsed to a single point.

01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:40.450
This is reflecting the fact
that if you look at a globe,

01:01:40.450 --> 01:01:45.160
all lines of longitude cross the
north pole and the south pole.

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:49.780
Every value of the
azimuthal angle

01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:51.370
on the surface of
the earth, they

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:53.980
become singular at the north
pole and the south pole.

01:01:53.980 --> 01:01:57.400
This drawing, well,
it's like one of those,

01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.650
I forget the names of them,
but the various renderings

01:01:59.650 --> 01:02:01.240
of a map that try
to take the earth

01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:03.460
and write it on a flat
space, and you wind up

01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:06.970
with Greenland being three
times the size of Africa,

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:08.090
or something like that.

01:02:08.090 --> 01:02:12.225
And it's because there should
be zero area at the top here.

01:02:12.225 --> 01:02:13.600
As you approach
the top the area,

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:15.058
it should be getting
much stronger.

01:02:15.058 --> 01:02:17.800
And when you do representation
of your map like this,

01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:19.950
you're spreading
everything way, way out.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:23.700
What is going on?

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.050
And why this idea of
drawing this world tube that

01:02:27.050 --> 01:02:29.670
is swept out by my
circle of radius

01:02:29.670 --> 01:02:32.250
r as it advances
forward in time?

01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:40.690
That drawing does not
account for the fact

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:46.660
that the Schwarzschild
time coordinate is singular

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:50.700
as you approach r equals 2gm.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:03:04.880
It's going to turn out all
times t map to a single sphere,

01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:07.530
and r equals 2gm.

01:03:10.890 --> 01:03:14.580
To get some insight into
what's going on here,

01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:16.194
let's do a little
thought experiment.

01:03:27.810 --> 01:03:30.390
What I'm going to do
is imagine I'm at rest

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:32.610
in the Schwarzschild spacetime.

01:03:32.610 --> 01:03:35.310
So let's say that I'm
at some finite radius r.

01:03:35.310 --> 01:03:36.570
I am not in a weak field.

01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:39.870
OK, maybe I am at
something like r equals

01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:42.760
4gm, or something like that.

01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:48.765
And what I'm going to do is drop
a little rock, drop a particle.

01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:03.810
So I'm going to drop a
particle from r equals r0.

01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:06.560
I'm going to integrate
the geodesic equation,

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.500
and I'm going to parameterize
what its radial motion looks

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:10.820
like as a function of "time."

01:04:35.890 --> 01:04:38.578
I put "time" in quotes
here because you

01:04:38.578 --> 01:04:40.120
should be saying at
this point, well,

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.910
you just told me that time is
doing something kind of funny

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:43.410
here.

01:04:43.410 --> 01:04:45.420
What do you mean by that?

01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:47.880
I'm actually going to do this
for two different notions

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:48.380
of time.

01:04:51.810 --> 01:05:00.330
I'm going to do this for
the coordinate time t,

01:05:00.330 --> 01:05:06.510
and I'm also going to
do this for proper time,

01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:14.980
tau, as measured along
that world, that infall.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:22.990
So I'm not going to
go through the details

01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:23.830
of this calculation.

01:05:23.830 --> 01:05:27.100
It's a straightforward,
moderately tedious exercise.

01:05:30.308 --> 01:05:32.350
I would just quote to you
what the result ends up

01:05:32.350 --> 01:05:33.106
looking like.

01:05:52.470 --> 01:05:54.950
So let's first write down
what the solution looks like,

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:58.530
parameterized by
the proper time.

01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:03.593
So this is most easily written
as tau, proper time, and 2gm.

01:06:03.593 --> 01:06:05.010
Essentially, I'm
just going to use

01:06:05.010 --> 01:06:06.900
it to set a system of units.

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:10.710
I write this thing
as a function of r.

01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:12.150
My solution turns out to be--

01:06:27.734 --> 01:06:29.940
it looks like this.

01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:33.230
So if I were to make a plot of
what this thing's motion looks

01:06:33.230 --> 01:06:46.020
like as a function of
time, so here's our 0.

01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:50.030
Here is r of tau.

01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:56.520
And let's just put in, for
fun, let's say this is 2gm.

01:07:02.090 --> 01:07:04.550
Zoom, fallen.

01:07:04.550 --> 01:07:10.630
You reach r equals 0
in finite proper time.

01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:14.350
The parable of the Kretschmann
scalar is that as you do so,

01:07:14.350 --> 01:07:17.470
the tidal forces acting
on you are diverging.

01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:21.340
So if you have any last
wishes, send them out

01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.290
because you're not going
to have a lot of time

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:26.340
to tell people about them.

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:34.480
Let's now write it as a
function of coordinate time t.

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.457
This ends up being--

01:07:42.457 --> 01:07:45.040
bear with me while I write this
out, this is slightly lengthy.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.210
OK, so what I mean
on this last line

01:08:25.210 --> 01:08:27.069
is if you want to get
the complete solution,

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:28.736
just write both of
these functions down.

01:08:28.736 --> 01:08:33.279
Again, subtract them off
and place the r's with r0.

01:08:33.279 --> 01:08:41.870
When you look at this,
here's what you see.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:51.412
The motion expressed in times
of the coordinate time t

01:08:51.412 --> 01:08:55.609
asymptotically approaches
the radius 2gm,

01:08:55.609 --> 01:09:00.069
but it never quite reaches it.

01:09:00.069 --> 01:09:03.700
As t goes to infinity,
it eventually reaches--

01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.359
so r, you can see it
appearing in the behavior

01:09:06.359 --> 01:09:07.979
of this natural log.

01:09:07.979 --> 01:09:11.258
r gets to 2gm as t
goes to infinity.

01:09:15.569 --> 01:09:22.399
So as measured by clocks
on the infalling body,

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:24.920
it rapidly reaches r equals 0.

01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:26.630
According to this
coordinate time,

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:28.550
it never even
crosses r equals 2gm.

01:09:31.180 --> 01:09:34.540
What the hell is
going on with that?

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:44.649
Well, to give a little
bit of insight into this,

01:09:44.649 --> 01:09:47.450
it's useful to stop for a
second and ask ourselves,

01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:52.370
what is that coordinate
time t actually measuring?

01:09:52.370 --> 01:09:58.375
So let me write down
the Schwarzschild metric

01:09:58.375 --> 01:09:59.500
and let's think about this.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.990
So kind of hard to see
what t means in this,

01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:26.480
but let's consider a limit.

01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:33.260
Suppose I consider observers
who are very far away.

01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:37.220
If I look at people who are at
r, much, much larger than 2gm.

01:10:44.110 --> 01:10:55.810
For such observers,
spacetime looks like this,

01:10:55.810 --> 01:11:00.850
and this is nothing more than
flat spacetime in spherical

01:11:00.850 --> 01:11:02.980
coordinates.

01:11:02.980 --> 01:11:05.740
This is what we call an
asymptotically flat spacetime.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:09.040
As you get sufficiently
far away from the source,

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:11.770
it looks just like
flat spacetime.

01:11:11.770 --> 01:11:14.153
essentially, special
relativity rules apply.

01:11:14.153 --> 01:11:15.820
And that gives us
some insight into what

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.370
this coordinate t means.

01:11:18.370 --> 01:11:21.220
The t that we are using in
the Schwarzschild coordinate

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:32.200
system, this is time as
measured by distant observers.

01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.750
Tau is time, as measured
by this infalling observer.

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:46.200
So what we are seeing here
is the infalling observer

01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:52.170
crosses 2gm, reaches r equals
0, and has a very short life.

01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:55.900
But those who are using
clocks, adapted to things very,

01:11:55.900 --> 01:11:59.850
very far away, never
even see it cross 2gm.

01:11:59.850 --> 01:12:01.890
Why is that?

01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:04.710
Well, we will pick this
up in the next lecture,

01:12:04.710 --> 01:12:07.620
but let me remind you
that when we initially

01:12:07.620 --> 01:12:11.550
began working on this subject,
one of the very first lectures,

01:12:11.550 --> 01:12:14.280
we talked about something called
the Einstein synchronization

01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:17.400
procedure, where what we did
was we imagined spacetime

01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:20.310
was filled with a conceptual
lattice of measuring

01:12:20.310 --> 01:12:21.960
rods and clocks.

01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:25.020
And we synchronized
all of those clocks

01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:31.530
by requiring that the time
delay between different clocks

01:12:31.530 --> 01:12:33.390
is synchronized
according to the time it

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:37.090
takes for light to travel
from one to the other.

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:40.110
This is telling us we
are actually working--

01:12:40.110 --> 01:12:41.700
when we use
Schwarzschild time, we

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.150
are working in a system
that reflects an underlying

01:12:45.150 --> 01:12:47.340
inheritance from
special relativity.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.880
These are clocks that have been
synchronized by the Einstein

01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:53.290
synchronization procedure.

01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:55.680
And so the pathological
behavior that we

01:12:55.680 --> 01:13:00.360
see here, it must ultimately owe
to the behavior of these clocks

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.490
that we use to define
our coordinate system,

01:13:02.490 --> 01:13:04.560
and the behavior of
those clocks is linked

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.410
to the behavior of light.

01:13:07.410 --> 01:13:11.370
So in order to get insight as to
what is going on with this, why

01:13:11.370 --> 01:13:14.430
is it that if I use a clock
adapted to the infalling body,

01:13:14.430 --> 01:13:17.370
I see painful death, but
if I use a clock adopted

01:13:17.370 --> 01:13:19.410
to someone very far
away, I don't even

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:23.195
see it approach that dangerous
r equals to a radius.

01:13:23.195 --> 01:13:24.570
In order to resolve
that mystery,

01:13:24.570 --> 01:13:29.100
I'm going to need to examine
what the motion of light looks

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.170
like in this spacetime.

01:13:31.170 --> 01:13:34.340
We'll pick that up
in the next lecture.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.210
[FELICE FRANKEL] So I'm sitting
here in Kim Vandiver's office.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.120
And actually, Kim was
the very first person who

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.090
got what I was trying to do.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.180
I knocked on his
door, basically.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.160
Isn't that right?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.340
Basically knocked on your
door and said, "can I

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.000
please come here and
make science pictures?"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.210
This was in 1994.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.140
You were the director of
the new Edgerton Center

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.130
that just formed.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.230
And you said sure,
let's give it a shot.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.220
And I just started making
more science pictures.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.129
And that kind of grew into
something more wonderful

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:05.630
here at MIT.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.730
So thanks, Kim, for
giving us some time.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.510
We're really eager to
see this little story

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.120
about Doc, and certainly
about the pictures

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.880
that he made, what he's known
for, and some of your pictures,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.460
too.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.969
It would be fun to tell
a bit of a story for us.

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:23.010
[KIM VANDIVER] Thank you.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.470
I'm really looking forward
to talking with you.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.740
It should be a lot of fun.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.680
[FF] You bet.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.690
So what drew me to
the Edgerton Center

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.720
is that people knew about it.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.590
And that's really where very
exciting photography of science

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.130
was taking place.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.481
And so it was a natural place
for me to at least start.

00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:40.979
[KV] Right.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:46.930
It had the Doc Edgerton history,
and lots of famous photographs.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.261
And she didn't
know me from Adam.

00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:50.759
Right?

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.020
I was just the director of the
Edgerton Center at the time.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.930
[FF] What gave me
the impetus was

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:02.310
that I had been starting playing
around at Harvard with George

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.200
Whitsides' work.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.620
And I did, in fact, have
a very small portfolio

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.070
of some pictures that I
made in a science lab.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.860
And so I had something to show.

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.991
It wasn't that I just
came in and said, hire me.

00:02:15.991 --> 00:02:16.490
[KV] Right.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.364
You had the Whitesides'
pictures at the time.

00:02:18.364 --> 00:02:20.130
[FF] I had the
Whitesides' pictures.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.745
And I think I might have
had a cover at that point.

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:23.620
[KV] I think you did.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.590
You had the cover
of the liquids on

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.281
the hydrophobic and
hydrophilic surfaces.

00:02:31.281 --> 00:02:32.030
[FF] You remember?

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.260
[KV] Absolutely.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.210
[FF] Oh my gosh.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.150
Yeah.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.880
But still, I'll be
forever indebted to Kim

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.660
for opening up the doors.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.250
That's basically
what you did for me.

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.420
[KV] That's what
we intended to do.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.040
That's what the Edgerton
Center was supposed to be for.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.610
So Doc first published
his photographs in a book

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:56.890
in the 1930's.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.010
And the first book was edited
by Jim Kelly, who, at that time,

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.170
was the director of
Technology Review.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.969
And he later became
the president of MIT.

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:09.510
[FF] Killian.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.009
OK.

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.970
There we go.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.210
I know that name somewhere.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.060
[KV] And so Killian--
and if you had

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.500
noticed, even this
book is-- this one

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.470
was published in the late '70s.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.502
And again, it's still
Edgerton and Killian.

00:03:22.502 --> 00:03:23.210
[FF] Interesting.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.940
[KV] So Killian edited the
first three books with Doc.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.090
[FF] And where do you come in?

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.800
[KV] Well, where I came in
was I was a grad student

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.960
here for a year in 1968.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.250
And when you come here to MIT in
the '60s, you heard about Doc.

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.160
He was a phenomenon at MIT.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.540
But then I left and went
those two years in the Army,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:51.954
and I took up
photography as a hobby

00:03:51.954 --> 00:03:55.940
and developed my own--
built in Trang, Vietnam

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.330
in 1970, a darkroom that anybody
could use, but then developed

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.360
my own color slides
while I was there.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.340
[FF] Kodachrome or E6?

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.840
[KV] No.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.810
The only thing--

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.950
[FF] That couldn't
have been Kodachrome.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.450
[KV] No.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.900
I think it was-- the only one
that you could get the process

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.950
for, I think, was Ectochrome.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.260
[FF] Which is E6.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.730
[KV] Yeah.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:25.490
And so built this photo lab on
my spare time in Trang, Vietnam

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.020
in 1970 and taught myself
to develop color film, which

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.440
is a painful process.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.240
[FF] Awful.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.490
[KV] Temperature
controls and all of that.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.070
So then I show up back at
MIT in January of 1972,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.850
and I'm facing taking
my doctoral exams

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.870
to qualify for the PhD program.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.560
And I was taking all these hard,
dreary subjects to prepare.

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.080
And I wanted to do
one thing for fun.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.190
And so I went and
knocked on Doc's door.

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.530
Didn't know him, but told him
about what I had been doing

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:01.380
and said, I really want to learn
how to do strobe photography.

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:04.130
Can I take your
undergraduate course?

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.380
And he said, sure,
we'll let anybody in.

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:10.680
[FF] "Anybody", even
you, right? [laughing]

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:11.180
[KV] Yeah.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.940
Even me, right?

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.000
And so I took the
subject that spring,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.140
which is called Strobe
Project Lab, which we still

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:20.290
teach today.

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.140
I was a grad student, and I
had had dozens of lab courses.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.150
And so the lab work was a lark.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.410
It was just fun.

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:27.960
And I just had a blast.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.460
And he needed a TA
the following year,

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.000
and so hired me to be
his teaching assistant.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.650
And that's when we really
got to know one another.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.450
[FF] What a story.

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:39.659
A little like-- not
quite our story,

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:45.170
but I met you when I,
too, knocked on your door.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.870
[KV] Same door.

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.190
[FF] Same door.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:49.675
I said, I'd really like
to make science pictures.

00:05:49.675 --> 00:05:53.760
And you said, we'll
take anybody. [laughing]

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.700
And at that point,
you were terrific.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.850
You just said, yeah, let's
see what we could do.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.350
And it expanded
through the years.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.370
[KV] Well, and that's
the spirit of Doc

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.680
that I wanted to have in what
we call the Edgerton Center.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.650
When Doc died in
January of 1990,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:17.370
I proposed to MIT that,
as a legacy to Doc,

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.700
we turn his laboratory
into a place

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:23.050
where MIT students could
come knocking on the door

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.280
and get help to
be able to pursue

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.230
hands-on experiential projects
that they wanted to do.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:34.250
And essentially, that
was the beginning.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.140
And the Edgerton
Center was formally

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.420
founded in August of '92.

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.534
And no now we're
pushing 25 years.

00:06:43.534 --> 00:06:44.284
[FF] That's right.

00:06:44.284 --> 00:06:46.076
You might have a
celebration at some point.

00:06:46.076 --> 00:06:46.620
[KV] Yeah.

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.120
We have to think about that.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:54.010
So we're almost 25 years
old, and the initial vision

00:06:54.010 --> 00:07:01.040
was to have it continue to
be a go-to place for know how

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:03.110
in high speed photography.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.120
So we continue to
teach the subjects.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.400
We continue to do a
professional development

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.410
course in the summer.

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:12.680
[FF] It's the go-to
place, no question.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.250
[KV] We try to still do that.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.260
But we also wanted to help
MIT students who had projects

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.470
that they wanted to work on
outside of the classroom.

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:26.715
And so today, the way that is
embodied in the Edgerton Center

00:07:26.715 --> 00:07:33.050
is, we sponsor about a dozen
student clubs and teams that

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.159
build stuff-- so the
Solar Electric Vehicle

00:07:35.159 --> 00:07:40.310
Team and Underwater Autonomous
Vehicle Team, Formula

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:45.330
SAE, Robotics, Aerial
Vehicles, a team

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:49.760
that rides coast to
coast called Spokes.

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.860
They ride bikes across the
country in the summertime,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.909
stopping along the way
to teach middle school

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:57.120
lessons in science.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.180
[FF] Oh, man.

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.060
I love that.

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:00.500
That's wonderful.

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.969
Let's turn to some
of Doc's pictures.

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:05.510
[KV] Alright.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:10.810
[FF] And maybe if we can
concentrate on what have become

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:13.220
iconic, in a way.

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.210
This is your story.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:17.470
We're looking at
books on the desk,

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.920
and Kim is going to look
with me at some images.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.430
And I might ask some questions.

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:27.500
We'd like to teach
our students taking

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.270
our course-- we'd
like to introduce them

00:08:30.270 --> 00:08:31.770
to some of the techniques.

00:08:31.770 --> 00:08:35.250
We don't want to go too deeply,
because we're not actually

00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:37.440
doing this in this course.

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:40.049
But I felt it was
important for them

00:08:40.049 --> 00:08:43.705
to be aware of this kind of
photography for later on,

00:08:43.705 --> 00:08:44.205
maybe.

00:08:44.205 --> 00:08:45.950
[KV] Right.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.500
I thought mostly
what I would talk

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.260
about today doesn't
actually have a lot to do

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:52.510
with high speed techniques.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:57.419
It has more to do with why
was Doc a great photographer.

00:08:57.419 --> 00:08:58.239
[FF] OK, great.

00:08:58.239 --> 00:08:59.159
Let's go.

00:08:59.159 --> 00:09:02.600
[KV] And that's
relevant to anybody

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.620
who's trying to take a picture.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:09.070
So I'm going to do it a
little bit chronologically.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:13.050
Doc was fascinated
with liquids and water

00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.440
and taking pictures of those
things, for some reason,

00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:16.290
very early on.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.480
And he claims the
very first picture

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.810
that he took of that wasn't
of an electric motor.

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.250
And he was taking pictures
of electric motors

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:27.290
because that was his PhD
thesis, and he needed the strobe

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.160
to help him understand motors.

00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.660
He claimed the first
picture that he

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:32.740
took using a flash,
of something else,

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.850
was water coming
out of a faucet.

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.880
And for the rest of his life,
he took pictures of water.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:40.380
Water is tricky.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.940
It's hard to take
pictures of it.

00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:46.430
And then his iconic photograph
is the crown splash,

00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:49.010
called "Coronet," the
splash of the milk drop.

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:51.410
And the original
black and white of it,

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:52.990
which we're looking
at right here,

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.190
was included in the first
ever photographic exposition

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:58.990
at the Museum of Modern Art.

00:09:58.990 --> 00:10:00.690
And I guess before
that, they didn't

00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:04.110
consider photography art.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:04.880
But it's there.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:05.880
It's in the collections.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.160
And it was 1937.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.720
So there's that picture,
and that's liquid again.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.260
But really, an amazing
picture that nobody

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:15.820
had ever seen before.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:20.450
Because really good stop motion
pictures hadn't existed before.

00:10:20.450 --> 00:10:22.760
But actually, in
fact, that's a lie.

00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.260
I went back recently
and did a little work,

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:28.910
because I helped with somebody
giving a talk in Cambridge.

00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:32.680
And there's some pictures
of splashes of milk drops

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.360
that go back to about
the turn of the century.

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:35.860
[FF] I know.

00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:37.740
[KV] And now I've forgotten
the name of the guy who did it.

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.440
Famous guy.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.840
[FF] I wrote it down somewhere.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:44.020
I just saw it at the
Victoria-- no, I'm sorry.

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.990
I saw it at the London-- it's
at the Science Museum in London.

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:49.010
[KV] That's right.

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:50.740
[FF] And I just
saw it a month ago.

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.700
I said, wait a second.

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.010
That's before Doc.

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:54.760
[KV] That's right.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.930
So I think Doc had to have
known about those and seen them.

00:10:58.930 --> 00:11:01.470
But the fellow
who had done them,

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.330
this was before good
electronic triggering.

00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:09.190
And this is about all I'll say
about high speed photography--

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.340
the key to high
speed photography

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.370
is to have a very
short duration flash,

00:11:15.370 --> 00:11:19.480
but to have a way of knowing
when to make it go off.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.290
In the trade, we call
that "triggering".

00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:24.600
How do you trigger the
flash to make it go off?

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.940
And the way you take a
bullet picture is you

00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:27.950
use a microphone.

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:31.140
And when the shock wave from the
bullet passes the microphone,

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.800
the microphone
sets off the flash.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.250
And in a darkened room,
you can look at where

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:37.620
the bullet is supposed to be.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:39.550
You shoot the gun,
the flash goes off,

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.830
your eye sees it
exactly where it is.

00:11:41.830 --> 00:11:44.610
And if you want your picture
to have the bullet three inches

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:46.830
to the left, you take
the microphone-- which

00:11:46.830 --> 00:11:48.367
is down below, out
of sight-- move

00:11:48.367 --> 00:11:50.075
it three inches to
the left, do it again,

00:11:50.075 --> 00:11:51.703
and it's exactly
where you want it.

00:11:51.703 --> 00:11:52.619
[FF] That's brilliant.

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:55.890
[KV] So triggering is a lot
of the story about high speed

00:11:55.890 --> 00:11:58.710
once you have a source
of a high speed flash.

00:11:58.710 --> 00:12:01.230
[FF] So you're actually
triggering the light.

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:03.010
[KV] Triggering the
timing and the light.

00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:06.810
It takes two things-- good
timing and a very short

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:09.230
duration burst of light.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:13.590
So one of the two
inventors of photography

00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:16.060
was William Henry Fox Talbot.

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.000
And in 1859, he took
a flash picture.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.950
So the first flash
photograph is 1859,

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:27.200
and it was an air gap spark
of a capacitor discharge.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.200
And it was a piece of
newspaper spinning on a disc.

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.720
So flash photography
goes back a long way.

00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.730
[FF] Do I remember correctly
that he tried it with water

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.945
and eventually decided to--

00:12:37.945 --> 00:12:39.070
[KV] I honestly don't know.

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:42.650
My guess is he-- I'm sure he
tried it wither water first.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:46.640
And in fact, my guess
is he saw it in water

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.070
and he said, oh, that is cool.

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:51.290
How can we really do it?

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.600
[FF] So is this just milk?

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.900
[KV] Yeah.

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:56.450
I know they used milk early on.

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:59.162
And of course, milk turns sour
in the lab in not very long.

00:12:59.162 --> 00:13:00.620
And so pretty soon
after that, they

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:02.670
figured out how to
do it with fake milk,

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:04.740
so that it would last
a little bit longer.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:09.000
So that picture, then,
was taken in the mid '30s.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.450
And then when color
film came out,

00:13:11.450 --> 00:13:13.920
then Doc took the
picture again in color.

00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:18.320
And that's the iconic one in red
that's on postcards everywhere.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.847
[FF] I sort of like
this one better myself.

00:13:20.847 --> 00:13:22.180
[KV] I'll tell a lot of stories.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:24.510
A couple of other
stories about Doc--

00:13:24.510 --> 00:13:27.410
he knew he had a good
thing, but the world

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.380
didn't know he had a good thing.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:34.440
And he went Kodak
and said, you ought

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:40.640
to make a product out of this
and sell cameras with flash

00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.740
units, with electronic flash.

00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.440
And at that time, people
were using flashbulbs.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:48.920
And they said, well,
we looked into it.

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:51.210
We figured we could sell
about 50 units a year.

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.330
It just isn't worth it.

00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:55.870
This is in the '40s.

00:13:55.870 --> 00:13:59.580
And so Doc set out then
to prove them wrong

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:03.350
and to generate so much demand
that they couldn't ignore it.

00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:06.550
And so he started building the
first portable units, battery

00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.540
operated.

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:13.670
He equipped sports photographers
with portable units.

00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:16.465
And so there's a picture
I didn't dig out today.

00:14:16.465 --> 00:14:19.970
It's in the Boston Garden,
and it's an indoor track meet.

00:14:19.970 --> 00:14:22.790
And it's a runner
coming around the curve.

00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:28.210
And it's just absolutely crisp
stop motion shot of this guy.

00:14:28.210 --> 00:14:31.860
And it was the first high
speed flash sports photograph

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.990
to go out on AP wire photo.

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:40.300
And then after that, there's
another fantastic image.

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:42.910
So Doc, he said, I'm
going to prove them wrong.

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:46.360
I'm going to show people that
this is the way to do it.

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.770
And the other picture that
I didn't pull out today

00:14:49.770 --> 00:14:56.810
is the absolutely
classic sports shot,

00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:01.400
which is the knockout
punch from Joe Lewis.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:04.070
It's the Joe Lewis shot.

00:15:04.070 --> 00:15:10.070
When that went out on AP, that
was a show-stopper picture.

00:15:10.070 --> 00:15:10.570
OK.

00:15:10.570 --> 00:15:11.680
There we go.

00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.529
And that is the Chilean
Arturo Godoy in 1940.

00:15:18.529 --> 00:15:20.070
[FF] Can you imagine
seeing something

00:15:20.070 --> 00:15:22.070
like that for the first time?

00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:23.530
Opening up a whole new world.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:24.320
Very exciting.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:27.312
[KV] So it didn't take, I think,
too many pictures like that.

00:15:27.312 --> 00:15:28.520
[FF] No, that's all you need.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:31.720
[KV] And the photography
industry started to say,

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.330
there's something
important here.

00:15:34.330 --> 00:15:37.540
So then he got really
fascinated with speed.

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.390
And what would
impress people more

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.720
than to be able to stop
a bullet in flight?

00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:45.710
I think that Doc said,
we got to do that.

00:15:45.710 --> 00:15:48.234
And so he took lots
of bullet pictures.

00:15:48.234 --> 00:15:49.650
So people know
pictures of bullets

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:52.490
through apples and
all sorts of things.

00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:54.640
[FF] And people are
doing it in classes.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.690
[KV] Yeah.

00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:58.330
And we show our students
how to take a bullet

00:15:58.330 --> 00:16:02.430
picture every year,
because it's just so cool.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:05.590
But the picture that I
pulled out to talk about

00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.910
is a picture that
has three balloons

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:12.890
in a row with a bullet
passing one after another

00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:13.640
through the third.

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:17.750
And so the first one is in
almost complete disintegration.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:19.810
The second one is
partially gone,

00:16:19.810 --> 00:16:21.890
and the third one is
just barely showing

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:24.280
the effects of being shot.

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.160
This essentially, in
a single photograph

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.200
with a single flash of
light, does a wonderful job

00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.680
of showing the passage of time.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.470
So I think this is just a
brilliantly crafted photograph

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:40.480
to tell a story in
a single picture.

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.550
[FF] That's mind blowing.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:45.911
[KV] He was really clever
at that kind of thing.

00:16:48.877 --> 00:16:50.460
And they took lots
of bullet pictures,

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.251
but this is one of my
favorites, because it

00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:53.930
was so cleverly done.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.550
And this was before
the development

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:02.810
of high-speed,
multiple flash cameras.

00:17:02.810 --> 00:17:06.460
So Doc's contribution to
high-speed photography

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.510
was the perfection
of two things.

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:12.730
The electronic
controls-- so now you

00:17:12.730 --> 00:17:14.660
had transistors
and modern things

00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:17.470
that you could switch
current very quickly--

00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:21.220
and also, very short
duration sources of light,

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.180
and in particular,
the xenon flash

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:27.160
tube, which is in every
camera that you buy.

00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:29.369
So he perfected the
xenon flash tube,

00:17:29.369 --> 00:17:34.250
which gives out very bright,
daylight color spectrum light

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:36.269
in a very short duration.

00:17:36.269 --> 00:17:39.510
[FF] Kim, around what year
are we talking about, roughly?

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:45.730
[KV] Well, there were
strobes available

00:17:45.730 --> 00:17:48.180
when he was doing his
PhD work in the late--

00:17:48.180 --> 00:17:49.730
he started about 1928.

00:17:49.730 --> 00:17:52.660
Then these pictures,
like the one

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:56.440
in the Museum of Modern
Art, early and mid '30s,

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.070
by that time, I think
he was using Xenon.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.390
He was developing flash
tube technology back then.

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:07.900
And I was a TA in
1972, one of the labs

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.290
that you did is
you went in the lab

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.730
and made your own flash tube.

00:18:12.730 --> 00:18:15.920
Doc really understood
flash tube technology.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:17.130
You had made your own.

00:18:17.130 --> 00:18:22.290
And so we had Pyrex glass
and glass blowing setup.

00:18:22.290 --> 00:18:25.570
And you took the
glass, and you learned

00:18:25.570 --> 00:18:27.590
how to embed the
electrodes in it

00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:29.830
to conduct the
electricity inside.

00:18:29.830 --> 00:18:32.920
You filled it with xenon
at the right pressure,

00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.570
and then you pinched it off,
and you had your own tube.

00:18:36.570 --> 00:18:37.920
[FF] Talk about hands on.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.074
[KV] Yeah.

00:18:39.074 --> 00:18:40.490
[FF] That's what
he was all about.

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:42.323
[KV] When you took the
course in those days,

00:18:42.323 --> 00:18:43.860
you tested flash tubes.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:45.800
You made your own.

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.790
And you also then went and
took pictures of bullets,

00:18:49.790 --> 00:18:52.300
and had to do a
project of your own.

00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.260
It was called
Strobe Project Lab.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.980
In the second half
of the course,

00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:59.250
you had to choose something
of your own to do.

00:18:59.250 --> 00:19:03.820
And so students, by that time,
had pushed multiple pianos

00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.790
off the top of dorms and
taken pictures of them

00:19:06.790 --> 00:19:08.900
and stuff like that.

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.060
But I was an ocean
engineer, and I

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:17.060
took on a project of taking
high speed technical photographs

00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:21.210
for quantitative purposes of
propellers in a water tunnel.

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.355
Because propellers under certain
conditions generate bubbles,

00:19:24.355 --> 00:19:27.220
and you may see this
helix going downstream,

00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:28.500
and it's called cavitation.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.460
The propeller cavitates,
it erodes it very fast

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.090
and damages it.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.670
And if you're a
submarine, it makes

00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.110
a horrendous amount of noise
and makes it easy to detect you.

00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:39.230
So cavitation is important.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:43.805
But pictures of things with
bubbles around them in water

00:19:43.805 --> 00:19:45.300
are actually kind
of hard to take.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.490
So we have a propeller tunnel
here in the Ocean Engineering

00:19:48.490 --> 00:19:52.410
department, and they had
been taking pictures in it,

00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:53.830
but they weren't very good.

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:56.110
And so I actually
took a lot of pictures

00:19:56.110 --> 00:19:59.870
and then wrote the manual on how
to actually take good pictures.

00:19:59.870 --> 00:20:02.190
[FF] Fantastic.

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.640
[KV] I think it's still
in the drawer over there.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.740
Lighting is the
most critical part.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.810
Bubbles reflect so much.

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:11.790
And the windows, you've got to
take pictures through windows,

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:13.320
which is a problem.

00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:14.630
[FF] Major problem.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:16.490
[KV] So you learn
all about how to take

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:20.050
the things that reflect on you,
and bubbles reflect like crazy.

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:25.240
So getting the lighting,
the exposure correct

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:26.016
is a tricky part.

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:26.516
[FF] Yeah.

00:20:26.516 --> 00:20:28.190
We talk a lot about that.

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:33.130
[KV] Doc was an opportunist,
but he was also very creative.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.780
Another thing that Doc did--
he was an MIT professor,

00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:40.690
and to this day, high speed
photography's probably greatest

00:20:40.690 --> 00:20:43.560
use is in industrial settings.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:47.860
Doc soon was sought out
by people in industry

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:52.130
to use high speed
photography to troubleshoot.

00:20:52.130 --> 00:20:54.440
All through his life,
he did lot of what

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.030
turned out to be really
interesting consulting jobs.

00:20:57.030 --> 00:20:59.220
So he was always
carrying his camera.

00:20:59.220 --> 00:21:01.594
And he would take
pictures of opportunities

00:21:01.594 --> 00:21:03.760
when he thought they were
just really cool pictures.

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.270
And this is one of
my favorite ones.

00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:13.775
This shows a mill
worker sometime in 1937.

00:21:13.775 --> 00:21:15.660
This is the paper mill.

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.650
And paper mills are
notorious for-- have you ever

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.190
seen a newspaper being printed
or something like that?

00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:25.300
The paper is streaming across
rollers at very high speed.

00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:28.670
And if something goes wrong,
you get an enormous mess

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:30.210
in a hurry.

00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:31.930
And it's going so fast.

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:33.630
The paper is moving so fast.

00:21:33.630 --> 00:21:36.290
You can't see with your
eye what the problem is.

00:21:36.290 --> 00:21:39.360
And so Doc's new high
speed photography

00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:42.580
was a real blessing
for people in industry

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:47.340
with things that were very high
speed and could get in trouble.

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:48.700
But this is an example of that.

00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:51.200
He was no doubt working
on a consulting job.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.884
You can see in the background
these big rolls of paper that

00:21:54.884 --> 00:21:56.050
are going through this mill.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.860
He had probably been taking
very technical pictures,

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.250
probably trying to get them
to understand something.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:05.650
And then he saw this fellow,
this worker, with a pitchfork

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:08.590
with this enormous
mass of trimmings

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:12.310
off the edges of a paper roll
forking this big-- like it's

00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:13.710
hay, but it's not hay.

00:22:13.710 --> 00:22:14.690
It's paper.

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:16.140
But it's a beautiful picture.

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.540
[FF] It's wonderful.

00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.400
[KV] And so his sense of seeing
a good picture and saying,

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.260
I've got to do this, and
then his craftsmanship

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.149
of being able to make
it a great picture, not

00:22:26.149 --> 00:22:27.190
just an ordinary picture.

00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:29.148
[FF] What kind of camera
was he lugging around?

00:22:29.148 --> 00:22:32.360
[KV] This was probably
a four by five.

00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:34.375
He used a lot of four by five.

00:22:36.850 --> 00:22:37.850
I've forgotten the term.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:38.660
I haven't used one in so long.

00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.451
[FF] Cassettes or--

00:22:39.451 --> 00:22:40.429
[KV] Yeah.

00:22:40.429 --> 00:22:42.970
With the back on it, and you
put it in and pull the slide out

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:44.160
and took you picture.

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.070
[FF] Which is
considerably cumbersome.

00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:50.080
This is without a tripod?

00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.382
[KV] My guess is-- I don't know.

00:22:53.382 --> 00:22:55.340
He would also, then-- he
would just carry along

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:59.840
a 35-millimeter of what camera
was available at the time just

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.664
to be able to take setup
pictures and quick stuff.

00:23:02.664 --> 00:23:04.580
But when he then really
wanted a good picture,

00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:07.455
he'd get out the four by five,
and he'd put it on a tripod

00:23:07.455 --> 00:23:10.120
if he had one there
and do it right.

00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:12.620
And this is a big version of
this picture in the hallway

00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.160
outside.

00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.110
[outside Kim's office] You
were standing almost in front

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.776
of if out there.

00:23:15.776 --> 00:23:17.020
[FF] Oh, OK.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.740
[KV] So that's one of my
favorite Doc "opportunity"

00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:22.190
kind of pictures that
came from his consulting.

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.840
So what's that?

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.480
Stonehenge.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:31.060
[FF] Wow.

00:23:31.060 --> 00:23:31.560
[KV] Yeah.

00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:33.400
It's a "wow" picture
of Stonehenge

00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.970
that was another opportunity.

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.940
He had to plan this
rather carefully.

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.790
Here's this sister picture
to this that's upstairs.

00:23:40.790 --> 00:23:42.450
And if we go upstairs,
you can see it.

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.720
It's this dull looking,
why do you bother to put

00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:47.080
that image on the wall picture.

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:50.700
But this photograph is taken
at midnight, thereabouts.

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.360
And the sister companion
picture that goes with it

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.360
is a photograph from a night
reconnaissance aircraft.

00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:03.970
The pilots are practicing
for taking photographs using

00:24:03.970 --> 00:24:10.340
brand new Edgerton strobe
equipment to take photographs

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:15.110
of Normandy in June of 1944.

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.740
So this is leading up to that.

00:24:16.740 --> 00:24:20.030
They've installed these
brand new electronic means

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:22.510
of taking reconnaissance
photographs

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:25.550
and put them in US Army
Air Force airplanes

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:27.140
and are teaching
the pilots to do it.

00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.560
Prior to the use
of flash, you would

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.550
have one plane fly over high
altitude-- like 5,000 or 10,000

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:36.386
feet-- and drop
flares on parachutes,

00:24:36.386 --> 00:24:37.760
and then the
reconnaissance plane

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:42.960
would have to fly in at
1,500 feet illuminated,

00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:47.940
backlit by the flares so that
people with guns could see it.

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.590
And so it was really
dangerous work.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:52.040
And then you'd fly over with
the lights from the flares,

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.610
taking the pictures, but
also getting shot at.

00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:56.210
So that had been
the standard way

00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:58.360
to do reconnaissance
photographs.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.810
The Army Air Force came to
him early in the war and said,

00:25:00.810 --> 00:25:05.470
can we use your flash technology
to take pictures at nighttime?

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:09.900
And so they started developing
really powerful flashes.

00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:13.040
So your typical
camera flash might

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:17.600
be five watt seconds of energy.

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.680
That's a measure
of electric power.

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.960
So five.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.540
So by the end of the
war, Edgerton flash units

00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:27.460
that were being carried
in reconnaissance aircraft

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:30.145
were 50,000 watt seconds.

00:25:30.145 --> 00:25:31.850
[FF] I can't even imagine.

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:34.520
[KV] And one of the
movies about Doc

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.490
that shows him in a
classroom, and he's

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:40.970
got a yardstick with a sheet
of newspaper taped to it,

00:25:40.970 --> 00:25:43.955
hanging from it, and he's
standing about as far from you

00:25:43.955 --> 00:25:44.480
to here.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.520
So the 50,000-watt second flash
unit has a reflector about this

00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.720
big around, and a flash
tube with the xenon in it.

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.650
It's a coil, a helix
about this big around.

00:25:56.650 --> 00:25:59.750
And you shoot it off, and
the piece of newspaper

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.060
would just burst into flames.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:03.850
That's how much
heat is coming off

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.370
of this thing with the light.

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:08.060
So they were installing units.

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:10.850
They wanted to send the pilots
out to practice with it.

00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:13.080
And he said, let's take
a picture of Stonehenge.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.560
And so he was on the ground, and
he set his four by five camera

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.960
on a fence post, and he
knew when they were coming.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.160
And he just opened
the shutter and waited

00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.349
for the night reconnaissance.

00:26:23.349 --> 00:26:25.640
[FF] Are you telling me the
light was coming from the--

00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.480
[KV] The light comes
from the airplane.

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.810
[FF] And it traveled that far?

00:26:30.810 --> 00:26:33.282
It was so strong.

00:26:33.282 --> 00:26:34.740
[KV] Because the
airplane is trying

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:36.480
to take a picture of
what's on the ground.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.855
So the photograph
that's upstairs

00:26:37.855 --> 00:26:41.800
is the photograph of Stonehenge
taken by the aircraft.

00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.610
So you can see the
aircraft photograph,

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.190
and this is the companion
photograph that goes with it.

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:47.940
[FF] That's an absolutely
fabulous story.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.370
[KV] So taking photographs
of things in wartime

00:26:50.370 --> 00:26:52.540
is pretty commonplace.

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.560
But knowing to be here with your
camera on the fencepost and get

00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:01.190
this image that no one else
before or since has been able

00:27:01.190 --> 00:27:01.780
to take...

00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.113
[FF] That's absolutely fabulous.

00:27:03.113 --> 00:27:08.070
[KV] So this just shows his
brilliance as a photographer.

00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:10.390
So I really love that picture.

00:27:10.390 --> 00:27:15.160
Then this is the more recent
typical bullet through apple

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.280
making applesauce.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.285
Doc's comment was, it
takes a microsecond

00:27:19.285 --> 00:27:23.940
to take the picture and
all morning to clean up.

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.920
And so I was his teaching
assistant in '73 -

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:33.950
'74 in this subject we
called Stobe Project Lab.

00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:39.600
And he was exactly my age now
when I was working for him.

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:44.240
He had just retired,
and he was 69.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:47.140
Retirement meant to him
that he got to keep his lab,

00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:50.410
but he only had to do what
he wanted to do, basically.

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.754
He was so important MIT.

00:27:51.754 --> 00:27:53.170
He said, look,
I'll tell you what.

00:27:53.170 --> 00:27:55.800
I'll stop drawing salary,
but you let me keep my lab.

00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:56.620
And they said fine.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:59.850
And so he kept coming to
work every day until 1990.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:04.040
So this was 1972.

00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:07.665
So I had been in the
class in the spring.

00:28:07.665 --> 00:28:09.165
In the summertime,
I'd talked to him

00:28:09.165 --> 00:28:11.720
and found out he needed a TA.

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.950
I was a doctoral student
in ocean engineering.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:17.800
In May of '72, I
did pass the exams.

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:19.670
And my one fun
thing for the term

00:28:19.670 --> 00:28:22.790
had been taken the high
speed photography course.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:25.370
And Doc and I agreed that
I'd be the TA in the fall.

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.350
So I showed up about
Labor Day, and there

00:28:28.350 --> 00:28:29.860
was a letter waiting for me.

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.360
And the letter said, Doc says,
sorry I can't be there, Kim.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.130
My mother's not feeling well.

00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.317
And at the time I said--
he's 69 years old.

00:28:36.317 --> 00:28:37.650
Your mother is not feeling well?

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.550
She was 98 or
something like that,

00:28:39.550 --> 00:28:41.820
and he was off visiting
with her in Nebraska.

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:44.710
And he said, well,
I'd like you to think

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:47.660
about working on a project
while you're my TA.

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:48.690
That's kind of unusual.

00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.910
TAs usually grade the lab
books and helps in the lab,

00:28:51.910 --> 00:28:55.570
but you don't do some
research as well.

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.450
Doc says, why don't
you do a project?

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:01.190
And he says, I've never done
Color Schlieren photography.

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.930
Now, Schlieren
photography had already

00:29:03.930 --> 00:29:07.880
been used for many, many
years in the aircraft industry

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:14.080
to take photographs of aircraft
models in supersonic speeds.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:16.390
Because at supersonic
speeds, everybody

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:18.670
knows about sonic booms--
you have a shock wave

00:29:18.670 --> 00:29:20.940
that comes off of the aircraft.

00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.420
And a shock wave is a
high intensity sound wave.

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:27.160
In the aircraft industry, you
could study the shock waves

00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.900
in a wind tunnel if you had
a photographic technique that

00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.360
would make shock waves visible.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.540
So it was called Schlieren, and
they did it in black and white.

00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:39.747
And there were a few
color techniques.

00:29:39.747 --> 00:29:41.580
But Doc says, so I've
done Schlieren before,

00:29:41.580 --> 00:29:43.380
but I've ever done
color Schlieren.

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.090
Why don't you see
if you can do that?

00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:48.690
So that was September.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:51.110
I want to the library,
found four different ways

00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:54.340
of doing Schlieren
photography in color,

00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:56.250
all the technical journals.

00:29:56.250 --> 00:29:58.910
Built my first setup,
took my first pictures.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.000
And Doc has come back by now.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.820
And I take them
in to him, and he

00:30:02.820 --> 00:30:04.810
takes that his 10
power loop, which he

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.460
always carried with him.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.820
And he holds the 35-millimeter
film up, and he looks at it

00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:14.640
and he says, Van, it looks
a little out of focus to me.

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.640
And it wasn't because I
couldn't focus a camera.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:21.860
But that's just the nature
of that particular method.

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:24.680
So then I went
back to the library

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:29.180
and built another system
and did it differently,

00:30:29.180 --> 00:30:33.330
and walked in a couple
weeks later and showed Doc

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:33.890
the pictures.

00:30:33.890 --> 00:30:35.920
And remember, this is color.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.790
Black and white was
easy in Schlieren.

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:38.830
This was color.

00:30:38.830 --> 00:30:41.990
So I walk in, and Van,
I don't like the color.

00:30:44.550 --> 00:30:47.480
So you have to
understand that one

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:51.220
of the reasons it took so long
is you get the system set up,

00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.100
you take some black
and white pictures just

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.480
to make sure it was looking OK.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.730
Because you could take
three or four frames

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:59.180
of 35-millimeter
black and white film,

00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:04.530
walk across to the photo lab,
develop it right on the spot,

00:31:04.530 --> 00:31:07.170
and hold it up wet
to see what you got.

00:31:07.170 --> 00:31:10.340
And if it looked right, then
you went back across the hall,

00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:12.720
put the color film
on the camera,

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.660
took a whole roll of
pictures, and then set it off

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.000
and waited a week.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.590
In 1972, you had to wait a week.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.340
[FF] I remember those days.

00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:24.840
It's called film.

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.340
[KV] Right.

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.620
It's film, and not
instant film, either.

00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:31.490
And it took a week
to get them back.

00:31:31.490 --> 00:31:34.260
So that was all
part of the process.

00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:39.440
So it wasn't until
December or so-- I

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.160
was getting pretty frustrated,
and I found an article

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.620
in Scientific American.

00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:47.100
And there was a
fellow by the name

00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:53.390
of CL Stong, who for decades had
a column in Scientific American

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:55.310
called The Amateur Scientist.

00:31:55.310 --> 00:32:00.120
And it was basically the
do-it-yourself science column

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:01.260
inside Scientific American.

00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:04.680
And he would accept
contributions from people

00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:06.780
and choose which ones he liked.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.530
And each month, there'd be
another build your own radio

00:32:09.530 --> 00:32:11.210
or do this or do that.

00:32:11.210 --> 00:32:16.230
And there was an article on a
new way to do color Schlieren.

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.390
And it had been developed
by a graduate student

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:23.100
at the University
of Tennessee, a guy

00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:25.010
by the name of Gary Settles.

00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:27.590
And he hadn't done the high
speed photography part,

00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:31.410
but he had come up with a
better way to do the color.

00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:35.690
So I built that, and I took the
pictures, and I had three four

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:36.340
of them.

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:38.430
And I think one of the
earliest pictures I took

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:39.920
was very much like this one.

00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.300
And I walked into Doc's
office one morning,

00:32:43.300 --> 00:32:46.250
and I handed him this
35-millimeter color slide.

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.070
And he looks up, and he says,
Van, I think you've got it.

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:50.700
[FF] Oh my gosh.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:51.807
Hallelujah.

00:32:51.807 --> 00:32:52.640
You must have felt--

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:55.570
[KV] September, October,
November, December, January.

00:32:55.570 --> 00:32:57.190
[FF] Whoa.

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.700
[KV] But then once we had
it-- once he saw a picture

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.235
like this, we knew we had it.

00:33:01.235 --> 00:33:02.610
And so then he
just encouraged me

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:04.904
to take pictures of
everything under the sun.

00:33:04.904 --> 00:33:06.570
And so we just tried
all sorts of stuff.

00:33:06.570 --> 00:33:08.160
[FF] So we're
seeing-- am I right?

00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.711
We're seeing changes
of index of refraction.

00:33:10.711 --> 00:33:11.210
[KV] Yeah.

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:15.810
So color Schlieren allows
you to see changes in index

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:20.170
in a transparent medium--
so water, air, anything

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:21.770
that light will
pass through, you

00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:23.360
can take a Schlieren
picture of it.

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.590
So this is a candle.

00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:27.500
This is just the
ordinary hot air

00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:29.380
above a candle, which
you normally can't see,

00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.900
except it's a mirage effect,
like when you're looking down

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.170
a highway in the desert.

00:33:34.170 --> 00:33:38.290
And this is a 22-caliber bullet,
and this is the shock wave

00:33:38.290 --> 00:33:39.960
that accompanies it.

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:46.372
And the amazing thing about
shock waves is they make a V.

00:33:46.372 --> 00:33:52.810
And the angle of the V-- one
over the sine of this angle

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.920
is the mach number.

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:58.632
So if that angle is 30
degrees, sine of 30 is 1/2.

00:33:58.632 --> 00:34:00.500
1 over 1/2 is 2.

00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:05.725
That bullet is traveling mach
2, or twice the speed of sound.

00:34:05.725 --> 00:34:06.600
[FF] That's fabulous.

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.199
[KV] So in pictures
like this, there's

00:34:08.199 --> 00:34:11.630
a lot of really interesting
physics and things

00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:12.620
to talk about.

00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:18.290
The color in this particular
Schlieren technique-- the color

00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:21.139
you see tells you the
direction in which

00:34:21.139 --> 00:34:23.090
the light was refracted.

00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:28.580
So this is a little bubble,
just a ball of hot air.

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:32.300
It's hottest in the center,
it's cooling radially.

00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:35.170
In all directions, the
temperatures are dropping.

00:34:35.170 --> 00:34:39.699
So the index of refraction
is increasing radially

00:34:39.699 --> 00:34:41.230
in all directions.

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:44.469
So if the light radios
into the upper part here,

00:34:44.469 --> 00:34:48.190
the light bends toward
increasing index.

00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:50.449
Up here, the light was bent up.

00:34:50.449 --> 00:34:52.150
Here, it was bent to the right.

00:34:52.150 --> 00:34:55.659
Here, it was bent to the left,
and in there, it was bent down.

00:34:55.659 --> 00:34:59.810
So up is yellow, down is blue,
left is green, right is red.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:01.929
[FF] So this is
highly informational.

00:35:01.929 --> 00:35:04.080
[KV] Lots really
cool information.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:05.820
[FF] Besides being
stunning to look at.

00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:07.469
[KV] So then you
look at a picture

00:35:07.469 --> 00:35:10.010
like this-- you can see
the candle flame nicely.

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.449
Now, that's itself illumination.

00:35:12.449 --> 00:35:16.500
That light is coming
from the flame.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:18.620
The light that took
the rest of the picture

00:35:18.620 --> 00:35:22.150
is coming from your
high speed source, which

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:26.240
is 1/3 of a microsecond in
duration, which allows you

00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.560
to stop a bullet in its tracks.

00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:32.630
But the light to
get the candle flame

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:34.910
comes from the
candle flame itself.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:38.587
But if you only had the shutter
open 1/3 of a microsecond,

00:35:38.587 --> 00:35:40.420
that's not enough light
from a candle flame.

00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:43.400
So in fact, the way you take
the picture is you turn off

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.510
all the lights in the
room, you open the shutter

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.980
on the camera for 1/4,
maybe 1/2 a second.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.940
And when the person on the
gun hears the shutter click,

00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.340
they pull the trigger.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:59.155
The bullet travels
across the system.

00:36:01.969 --> 00:36:04.010
The microphone is sitting
right here, by the way.

00:36:04.010 --> 00:36:06.100
You can see the shock
wave right down here out

00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.237
of sight as the microphone.

00:36:07.237 --> 00:36:08.695
The shock wave hits
the microphone,

00:36:08.695 --> 00:36:11.870
the microphones sets off the
flash, takes the picture.

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:16.545
So the flash is a third of
a microsecond in duration.

00:36:16.545 --> 00:36:20.300
And that's the exposure time
for everything you see here.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:22.780
But the shutter has been
open a half a second.

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:24.720
And so you have a
half a second exposure

00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.440
time of the candle flame.

00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:28.500
So they're always blurry,
because they flicker

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:30.790
when the shock wave goes by.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.890
[FF] But he got
past that, right?

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:34.160
[KV] Oh yeah.

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:35.360
And that's a sparkler.

00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.340
So if you knew what
you shutter time was,

00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:42.350
your exposure time-- let's
say it was 1/8 of a second

00:36:42.350 --> 00:36:45.150
or something, or maybe
less-- these little

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:48.050
trails are the sparks.

00:36:48.050 --> 00:36:50.012
You could figure out
how fast they're going.

00:36:50.012 --> 00:36:50.844
[FF] Oh gosh.

00:36:50.844 --> 00:36:51.499
Of course.

00:36:51.499 --> 00:36:53.290
[KV] So if you know
how long-- this is then

00:36:53.290 --> 00:36:57.430
a time exposure of
the trail of a spark

00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:58.930
as it travels through the air.

00:36:58.930 --> 00:37:01.170
[FF] Like subatomic particles.

00:37:01.170 --> 00:37:02.530
[KV] Yeah, in a way.

00:37:02.530 --> 00:37:07.340
It's kind of like
a smoke chamber.

00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.810
So actually, here's one
of my favorite pictures

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:11.420
of my own stuff.

00:37:11.420 --> 00:37:14.350
And I'll talk about
both of these.

00:37:14.350 --> 00:37:17.360
This is a picture
just of a soap bubble,

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.800
and it's just about life size.

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.310
And soap bubbles in
Schlieren systems

00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:24.520
turn out to be
really interesting.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.480
You see things you
don't normally see.

00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.460
So this is a rubber hose.

00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:31.330
It was dunked in
the soap solution,

00:37:31.330 --> 00:37:34.070
and then you blow on the end
of the hose to make the bubble.

00:37:34.070 --> 00:37:36.550
These are little streamers
of soapy solution

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:39.690
that are actually flowing on
the surface of the bubble.

00:37:39.690 --> 00:37:41.360
And they do most
interesting things.

00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:43.460
They go along, and then
they divide, and then

00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:44.400
they divide again.

00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.095
And a movie of this
is just fascinating.

00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.050
In a picture like this,
if you look carefully,

00:37:51.050 --> 00:37:53.740
you can actually see--
this is a shock wave,

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:55.960
but that's reflected
shock wave that

00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:58.895
has actually hit the rubber
hose and bounced off.

00:37:58.895 --> 00:38:01.300
And down here, there's an arc.

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:05.410
That's sound that's being
reflected off the bubble.

00:38:05.410 --> 00:38:07.000
So bubbles are a lot of fun.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.500
And then this picture
is fun in a sense

00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:13.220
in that Doc took this
picture in another form

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:14.780
many, many years before.

00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.810
So that's 1930s.

00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:20.730
It's an old house fan,
and it's spinning.

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:24.160
And just above it
is artificial smoke.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.830
It's basically chemical smoke.

00:38:26.830 --> 00:38:29.510
And as the propeller
blade passes

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:35.030
by off the tip of any
surface, it's generating lift.

00:38:35.030 --> 00:38:36.270
There's a vortex.

00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:39.200
And he put the smoke there so
it gets sucked into the vortex

00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.230
and shed downstream as a helix.

00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:44.190
So in this picture,
you can see that vortex

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:45.770
forming in the smoke.

00:38:45.770 --> 00:38:50.500
And this is the same
photograph with the same fan--

00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:54.710
because he still had it around
the lab -- in Schlieren.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:55.960
[FF] This picture has the fan.

00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.380
The fan is--

00:38:56.380 --> 00:38:57.838
[KV] This picture
is the whole fan.

00:38:57.838 --> 00:39:02.330
This one-- this is
an alcohol lamp.

00:39:02.330 --> 00:39:03.795
Usually, a little,
tiny blue flame.

00:39:03.795 --> 00:39:05.620
This is just hot air.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:08.340
The hot air is being
sucked into the vortex,

00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:09.820
and then it is shed down.

00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.390
Here's the helix.

00:39:11.390 --> 00:39:15.317
It's this core vorticity
that goes off this way.

00:39:15.317 --> 00:39:16.900
So there's another
one of the subjects

00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:18.200
that we took pictures of.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:22.210
So Schlieren photographs
were a lot of fun.

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:26.530
And then there's one
other bit of story

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:30.470
that is appropriate to,
of course, where you're

00:39:30.470 --> 00:39:32.730
teaching grad students
and that sort of thing

00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:35.360
about taking photographs.

00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:37.461
This picture, Doc really liked.

00:39:37.461 --> 00:39:38.335
And he said, OK, Kim.

00:39:38.335 --> 00:39:40.295
He says, you need
to write a paper,

00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:42.170
and then we're going to
go to this conference

00:39:42.170 --> 00:39:43.740
and show your stuff.

00:39:43.740 --> 00:39:46.570
Give this paper at the
11th International Congress

00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:50.020
on High Speed Photography
in London in, I think,

00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:52.280
the summer of 1973.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:55.320
So I had this venue were
Doc was the grand old man.

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.750
He was the father of modern
high speed photography.

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:00.010
It was at University
College London.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.880
They filled the auditorium.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.942
And all these old cronies
that were friends of Doc

00:40:04.942 --> 00:40:07.150
that he'd worked with through
the war and afterwards,

00:40:07.150 --> 00:40:09.370
he was famous with these people.

00:40:09.370 --> 00:40:14.310
So here I was under his wing,
getting to go everywhere he

00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:17.410
went and treated like royalty.

00:40:17.410 --> 00:40:19.245
So I gave them my
paper, showed 30 or 40

00:40:19.245 --> 00:40:24.605
of these beautiful color images
that people hadn't seen before.

00:40:24.605 --> 00:40:27.270
But he had also taken
about a dozen pictures, had

00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:30.640
them enlarged to 16 by
20, sent them ahead,

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.060
and they'd all been
set up in a gallery.

00:40:33.060 --> 00:40:34.760
So anybody coming
through the place

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:38.650
could walk through this gallery
and see all these photographs.

00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:40.640
So while I was there,
this fella comes up to me

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:43.870
and he said, I really
like your photographs.

00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:47.080
And he said, I'd
like to use them.

00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.280
I said OK.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:54.413
And so this picture was a cover
photograph on Nature Magazine.

00:40:54.413 --> 00:40:55.425
[FF] Oh gosh.

00:40:55.425 --> 00:40:58.160
[KV] So this was my first
professional publication

00:40:58.160 --> 00:40:59.110
as a grad student.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:02.020
It was a little short
article in Nature

00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:03.510
with this photograph
on the cover.

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:04.760
[FF] What year?

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.250
[KV] '74.

00:41:06.250 --> 00:41:09.689
There might be a copy of
it around here somewhere.

00:41:09.689 --> 00:41:10.480
Talk about having--

00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.230
[FF] I get it.

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:15.150
[KV] To have your first
publication when you're

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:16.894
applying as a
professor or something

00:41:16.894 --> 00:41:18.810
somewhere, to be a cover
photograph in Nature,

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:20.310
that's a pretty
good place to start.

00:41:20.310 --> 00:41:22.900
[FF] It's a pretty good
place to start. [laughing]

00:41:22.900 --> 00:41:23.940
This is great.

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.260
Oh, Kim, thank you.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:28.463
This is a wonderful,
wonderful story.

00:41:28.463 --> 00:41:30.235
Not bad.

00:41:30.235 --> 00:41:33.410
[KV] So that was my first
professional publication

00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.910
as a graduate student.

00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:40.270
And it was a nice thing to have
on my resume going forward.

00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:42.960
I've said many times, I
wouldn't be here today

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.860
if I hadn't had that
experience with Doc Edgerton.

00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.310
Even though I was
an ocean engineer

00:41:49.310 --> 00:41:52.510
and I didn't continue
professionally

00:41:52.510 --> 00:41:58.070
in high speed photography
as his mentee, what

00:41:58.070 --> 00:42:02.570
it did for me is the year I
worked for him as a teaching

00:42:02.570 --> 00:42:05.170
assistant was a
year I was not doing

00:42:05.170 --> 00:42:07.380
something in ocean engineering.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.090
And that was because I
hadn't found a thesis

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.380
topic that I really liked.

00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.200
And it gave me a
year of extra time

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.580
that I could go do
something fantastically fun

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:20.920
and find a good thesis topic.

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:22.530
So by the end of
that year, I not only

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:27.280
got to give this paper, but I
had come up with a super thesis

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:31.090
topic, which then that opened
the doorways for me to becoming

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:34.220
a professor of
ocean engineering.

00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:35.880
[FF] Timing.

00:42:35.880 --> 00:42:37.930
[KV] Timing, a little luck.

00:42:37.930 --> 00:42:40.600
And not being afraid
to knock on the door.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:41.870
[FF] There you go.

00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:42.690
Thank you.

00:42:42.690 --> 00:42:45.180
Exactly.

00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.700
Good job, Kim.

00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.300
[KV] Yeah.

00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:49.150
Thank you.

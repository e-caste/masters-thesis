WEBVTT

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.028
PROFESSOR: OK, all right,
so just very briefly,

00:00:28.028 --> 00:00:30.070
I just wanted to remind
you because it goes along

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.730
with the video,
bioluminescence is

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.360
light emitted based on
a biochemical reaction.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.680
The most common one is
the enzyme luciferase,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.520
which reacts with a
molecule called luciferin

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.690
to undergo a biochemical
transformation that uses ATP.

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.630
And as a result of
that transformation,

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.290
there is light emitted.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.190
So you don't have to
shine light onto these.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.520
The light comes from the
biochemical reaction.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.269
So the assays and a
lot of biological work

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.170
is based on the luciferin,
luciferase reaction,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.580
so the mushrooms that do this
will have both luciferase

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:14.230
and luciferin.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:19.150
So in an organism, you can
transfect-- or in cells,

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.720
you can transfect
cells with luciferase,

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.120
and then when you're
ready to do the--

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.510
to see the luminescence,
the bioluminescence,

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.750
you can add luciferin
exogenously,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.520
and there's a number
of chemists that

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.010
are trying to make
modified systems that

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:38.890
have different light
energies and so on.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.830
So there's a lot of
protein engineering

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.600
that's taking place based on
the luciferin/luciferase pair.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.210
There's all kinds of cool
biochemistry going on there,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.880
OK?

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.880
Anyone who comes in could
come and grab a donut.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.715
We can move them, or
do you want a donut?

00:01:57.715 --> 00:01:58.670
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.840
PROFESSOR: OK, all right.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.930
I didn't mean to
call attention to--

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.690
OK, I want to go briefly
back to arrays, DNA arrays,

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.620
because I want to explain to you
the power of this technology.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.140
So last time, we were talking
about arrays which are

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.910
basically printed layouts,
and I'm-- this is going to be

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.420
a very tiny array with
six sites on the array.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.180
So it's a two by three array.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.600
The ones that are
used in biology

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.370
are way larger than that.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.100
You can see those up here--

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:48.310
far, far more spots, and this is
just the size of a glass slide

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.850
and at each of
these sites, there

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.130
would be different
DNA sequences.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.420
So they're specific
DNA sequences,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.050
and they are printed
onto the array with--

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:08.090
it was originally done
just with printers.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.050
Now there's more technological
ways of handling this,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:19.950
and they're usually on
silicon or glass slides.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.450
So there's a lot of engineering
went into the original arrays

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.860
to make these really packed
tight distribution of DNAs.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.230
And these would be what are
called addressed arrays.

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.900
We know what's at
each of the sites.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.600
We're aware of the sequences
at each of the sites,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.490
and there's really
cool chemistry

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.130
that would have enabled the
disposition of these arrays.

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.220
So what these
arrays are used for

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.980
is to probe complementary
pieces of DNA.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.410
So let's say we've
got a GHIJ that

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.170
come potentially from genomic
DNA, and they complement--

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.900
each of them complement one
of the sites on the J-K--

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.110
complement one of the
sites on the array,

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:08.180
but the DNA that
you're screening

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.330
is specifically labeled
with a fluorophore, OK?

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.329
So these would be
fluorophore labeled,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.270
and arrays enable you to
do is to rapidly screen

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.080
either genomic DNA or,
actually, much more usefully,

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.190
as you'll know now, the
transcriptome, so the messenger

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.420
RNAs, and I'm going to
remind you about technology

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.600
to take the messenger
RNAs from cells

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.730
and then make them
an appropriate copy

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.220
of a complementary DNA
to what's on the arrays.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.190
So let's go take a look
at the next slide which

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.330
describes the experiment.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:51.100
So let's say you want to
screen populations of cells

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.860
where one set of
cells is cancerous

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.690
and the other one is healthy.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.630
You would collect the
lysate from those cells.

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.710
You would collect the
messenger RNA presumably

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.280
based on a tag or a feature
of the messenger RNA

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.080
that's common to
just the messenger.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.580
What would that be?

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.660
What would be common to the
mature messenger RNA that

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.530
would allow you to capture
just the messenger RNA,

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.140
not all the other RNAs, not DNA.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.730
Anyone?

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:21.230
Yeah?

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:22.202
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:22.202 --> 00:05:23.710
PROFESSOR: The poly-A tail.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.080
So you can, with an
appropriate resin,

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.720
for example, a
poly-T support, you

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.770
can capture that all,
and then in each case,

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.010
you would take the
messenger RNA collection,

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.080
and then what you
need to do is turn it

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.040
into a complementary
DNA sequence.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:44.830
We're much happier
screening at the DNA level

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.390
because the RNA is less stable.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.410
So it's really handy
to do that conversion,

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.640
and you use the viral enzyme,
reverse transcriptase.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.450
That's an enzyme that comes
from the retroviruses that

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:02.110
are exemplified by
the HIV retrovirus

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:04.630
that we'll be talking about
in the last week of class.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.560
So you'll learn where reverse
transcriptase fits in the life

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.780
cycle of the HIV virus.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.320
Then once you've
collected the DNA that's

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.395
complementary to the RNA
from each type of cell,

00:06:17.395 --> 00:06:20.110
you label them
uniquely, for example,

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.200
with green fluorophores
or red fluorophores.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.500
It's kind of a global
reaction you just paste--

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.850
chemically link the
fluorophore to each set of DNA.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:33.750
And then you basically
combine everything

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.360
and take a look at how
the chips, how the arrays,

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:38.440
light up.

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:41.560
So your typical experiment
would be everywhere

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.470
you've got something that
has a red fluorophore might

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.510
bind to a unique site.

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.940
Everything with a
green fluorophore

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.940
might bind to another
unique site on the array.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:57.580
And then if both types of
DNA binding to the same site,

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.680
that would show up as yellow.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.700
If nobody is binding, it
would show up as a blank spot.

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:07.120
So you get these collections
where, pretty easily, you

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.480
can look at thousands
of sequences

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.580
to see whether
they're complementary.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.270
That's on your array.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.900
Everywhere you see
yellow, the cancer cell

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.740
and the healthy cell, a
binding kind of equally,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.350
so there's nothing
disease related there.

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:26.380
So that's an interesting
feature because you can say,

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:30.280
well, none of these are
problematic segments,

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.600
but then you see very clearly
spots that are clearly red.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:40.120
So the sequences of the DNA
on the glass or silicon chip

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.610
are complementary
to sequences that

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:47.020
are unique to the mRNA
in the cancer genome,

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:51.130
in the cancer cell
line from that lyaste.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:52.883
So it's pretty cool.

00:07:52.883 --> 00:07:54.800
I don't know if any of
you have hit that link,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.940
but it's basically this
guy is sitting at a bench

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:02.320
and doing an experiment where
he's able to do thousands--

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.710
the equivalent of thousands and
thousands of experiments just

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:09.370
by using one gene chip
to do the probing.

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:14.770
In other cases, you will
see spots that are green,

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.710
which mean they come exclusively
from the healthy cells.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.100
So those would be really the
ones you want to interrogate,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.050
and where it's black,
nothing's binding,

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:25.390
so it's less important.

00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:29.170
So it allows you to go from a
grid of thousands and thousands

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:32.710
of different sequences
to pick out suspects

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.064
in a disease-related situation.

00:08:35.064 --> 00:08:36.580
Does that makes sense?

00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.559
Pretty cool technology.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:41.030
The original chips were called--

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.340
they were from, I think,
Affymetrix, the Affy chips,

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:50.040
and they are really widely
used even to this day,

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.480
and there are different
types of variations,

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.430
but I think one
of the most useful

00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.160
and ones that will remind you
of certain things we've talked

00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:00.070
about in the class
is that you can

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:05.500
grow cells of different sort
of, you know, histories.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.780
For example, you
collect the messenger

00:09:07.780 --> 00:09:10.090
RNA because, remember,
the transcriptome is

00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:13.720
much more interesting
to us than the genome.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.590
The chips would have
to be a lot bigger

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:19.140
to scan all of the
genome, and then you

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.100
use reverse transcriptase
to make a complementary DNA

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.730
of the RNA because it's
more stable, more tractable

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.360
to work with, and then you
put on a fluorophore label,

00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.700
mix everything together,
and see what you get.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:36.390
So those are my candidate spots.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.410
So if you had an
experiment, let me think--

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:43.780
walk you through what
the arrays can do,

00:09:43.780 --> 00:09:46.950
but let's make sure we know
what they can't do because it's

00:09:46.950 --> 00:09:50.080
always important
whenever someone says,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.690
I got this technology.

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:54.840
It's going to solve all
the problems of the world.

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.207
Throw away or your
beakers and test tubes.

00:09:57.207 --> 00:09:58.790
You just don't need
to do any of that,

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.720
and you can solve
everything with arrays.

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.040
So let's say you've got a
situation that, in some cases,

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:07.650
although genes may be
defective, the messenger

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:09.690
is still produced, OK?

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:14.260
So there's something wrong,
but you make the messenger RNA.

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:19.800
So it would still kind of
show up normally on the chip,

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.810
but the gene defect prevents
translation into proteins.

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.630
So you get the gene, but
you can't translate it,

00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:30.540
so it's going to look
like a normal gene,

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:33.600
but it's in the translation
from the track--

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:37.690
from the messenger RNA to the
protein where things go wrong.

00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.950
What are you going
to see on the array?

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:42.150
Is it going to look healthy?

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:43.710
Is it going to look not healthy?

00:10:46.781 --> 00:10:48.420
What's going to be the outcome?

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:53.530
Could I use an array, a DNA
array, for this experiment?

00:10:53.530 --> 00:10:54.270
Yeah?

00:10:54.270 --> 00:10:55.334
What do you think?

00:10:55.334 --> 00:10:56.262
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, Yeah.

00:10:58.590 --> 00:11:02.460
It's just going to look like
everything binds to the chip.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.900
It's not going to
be informative.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:08.700
So in this case, you need to do
very different experiments that

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:10.950
are at the protein
level, all right?

00:11:10.950 --> 00:11:12.810
So I want you to
remember that these

00:11:12.810 --> 00:11:18.180
are very good to get the genomic
sequence, the messenger RNA

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:19.120
sequence.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:23.490
But if you've got, for example,
a protein that is made,

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.750
and there's a problem
with, let's say,

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.020
a phosphorylation
by a kinase that

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.630
may be critical for
function in a cell,

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:33.300
you will not see
that in the array.

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:34.530
That will not be visible.

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.890
You'd have to do different
types of experiments,

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:39.510
for example, with
phosphoproteins,

00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:42.090
specific antibodies
to tell that there was

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:44.310
a disorder in those systems.

00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:46.110
So always when
someone tells you,

00:11:46.110 --> 00:11:49.500
I've got this great experiment,
you say, what can it do?

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:52.050
That is awesome, but
what can't it do?

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:55.070
OK, I need to worry
about that, all right?

00:11:55.070 --> 00:12:00.750
OK, so what we've
seen so far is we've

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:03.900
seen a variety of
fluorescent tools,

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:06.360
for example, to
label the nucleus,

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:10.950
either the original ethidium
bromide types of stains that

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.690
will intercalate into DNA and
give you a fluorescent signal

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:17.550
that could be seen on a gel.

00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:23.640
We've seen the evolution
of ethidium bromide

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:27.695
to less toxic materials,
for example, the DAPI stain.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:34.160
So ethidium bromide
intercalates--

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.005
ethidium-- sorry, DAPI
binds in the minor groove.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.110
And we saw images
of that last time.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.090
One important
distinction that is

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:54.150
made with these kinds
of dyes is that DAPI

00:12:54.150 --> 00:13:04.550
is what's known as a
supravital dye, which

00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:08.450
means you can use that dye
and observe live cells.

00:13:08.450 --> 00:13:12.530
So supravital is associated
with the types of experiments

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:16.370
that you can do observing
cells that are still alive.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.410
The ethidium bromide
is not such a dye,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:26.330
and neither are the antibodies
because so ethidium bromide is

00:13:26.330 --> 00:13:31.400
toxic, so even though
the ethidium bromide gets

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:32.930
into cells, it
actually should have

00:13:32.930 --> 00:13:38.690
the H here because that would
be ethyl bromide in my language.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:42.080
So ethidium bromide
has the H there.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:43.190
You can't use that.

00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:46.580
It's not a supravital dye
because it's toxic to cells

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.630
because intercalates in the
DNA and disrupts replication,

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:54.410
so that is not
supravital, so DAPI is.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:14:02.000
This guy isn't, and
antibodies, which

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.550
we learned a little bit
about last time, these

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.430
are from my
description, are simply

00:14:07.430 --> 00:14:13.130
reagents to recognize components
of biological systems, most

00:14:13.130 --> 00:14:17.900
commonly, proteins,
and now we're

00:14:17.900 --> 00:14:19.640
getting better at
making antibodies

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:24.390
to carbohydrates or glycans.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:28.527
Are antibodies supravital
or not, and why--

00:14:28.527 --> 00:14:29.360
if they're not, why?

00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:35.970
Could I use that on a cell
and follow a live cell

00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:36.820
with an antibody?

00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:37.320
Yeah?

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:37.955
Carmen?

00:14:37.955 --> 00:14:39.747
AUDIENCE: It doesn't
seem very likely to me

00:14:39.747 --> 00:14:42.348
that the antibodies will
allow the proteins to do

00:14:42.348 --> 00:14:44.220
whatever it is that they do.

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:45.303
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:14:45.303 --> 00:14:47.220
AUDIENCE: So I think
that the cells would die.

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.720
PROFESSOR: So it's a correct--

00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.470
they are not supravital.

00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:54.420
What do you think
would happen if I add

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:57.420
an antibody to a living cell?

00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:01.080
Could it stain-- it could stain
something on the cell surface,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.180
but it might, as
you say, interfere

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.890
with the function of the cell.

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:08.130
Let's say I have an antibody
to the epidermal growth factor

00:15:08.130 --> 00:15:09.090
receptor.

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.040
That is going to
alter the properties.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.230
So you're correct
in that respect.

00:15:13.230 --> 00:15:17.780
What about targets inside cells?

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.260
Are the antibodies
going to get in?

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:20.412
Yeah?

00:15:20.412 --> 00:15:21.394
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.850
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:15:23.850 --> 00:15:24.890
Yeah.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.710
Yeah, it's a big wall, frankly.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:30.130
It's an impenetrable
barrier to get in.

00:15:30.130 --> 00:15:32.800
So you can really
only stain in--

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:38.095
you can only observe in what
are known as fixed cells.

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.500
And when we call a
cell a fixed cell,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.590
we actually mean we've broken
it because what we've done

00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:50.810
is we've treated the cell
population with methanol,

00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:53.390
which pokes holes all over
the cellular membranes.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:54.640
They're fixed.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.410
They're static on a slide.

00:15:56.410 --> 00:15:58.480
They're not going to
move around anymore,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.430
and you can stain
with antibodies.

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:02.830
You can tell what
happened at the moment--

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:05.380
what was happening at
the moment the cell

00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.670
passed away, if you
will, what was going on,

00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.860
which proteins were there.

00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.530
But you can't keep
observing moving forward

00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.770
because the cells then are
no longer viable, all right?

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:17.950
So neither of these
approaches are super vital,

00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:20.030
but they're for
different reasons.

00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:21.640
One is toxicity.

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.880
The other one is also toxicity,
as Carmen pointed out,

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:27.940
but it's also a problem
with membrane permeability.

00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.670
So what we're going to
talk about in the rest

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:33.820
of this lecture is
a way to get around

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:39.715
this impenetrable
problem, and this--

00:16:39.715 --> 00:16:49.020
and the discovery of the
green fluorescent protein,

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:53.530
and we're really mostly about
GFP and its close siblings

00:16:53.530 --> 00:16:55.270
that might be different colors.

00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:57.460
What I want to walk you
through is the discovery

00:16:57.460 --> 00:16:59.530
of the protein,
and I really want

00:16:59.530 --> 00:17:04.240
to impress upon you how science
happens in funny, small steps

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:05.200
early on.

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.220
You could never have
predicted that a jellyfish

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:11.170
off the coast of
Seattle was going

00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:14.800
to revolutionize biology,
biochemistry, life sciences,

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.740
right?

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:17.650
Who would have ever
thought of that?

00:17:17.650 --> 00:17:22.210
And so that's why, you
know, they colleagues, we

00:17:22.210 --> 00:17:25.210
and our colleagues, are so
excited about fundamental

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:28.160
science where you don't quite
know where you're going,

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.280
but you're working
on something cool,

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.820
and then the prepared
mind goes, wow!

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.020
That's interesting.

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:37.720
I could use that
for this problem.

00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:41.260
So Shimamura was a
Japanese biochemist,

00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:46.360
who was fascinated by jellyfish
and their bioluminescence

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:49.810
and worked for years, slaved
away for years and years.

00:17:49.810 --> 00:17:52.030
Apparently, he would
go with his family

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:54.670
to the small islands
in Puget Sound

00:17:54.670 --> 00:17:57.670
and have his kids go and
collect jellyfish all day

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:01.540
long because he noticed certain
things about the jellyfish that

00:18:01.540 --> 00:18:05.050
were rather intriguing with
respect to their properties.

00:18:05.050 --> 00:18:07.150
And the key thing
that was observed

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:12.190
was that there is a
bioluminescent protein

00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:14.830
in jellyfish known as aequorin.

00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:17.500
So that's the kind of
luminescence we just

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:21.460
described, but in the
dark, there was also

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:26.140
a fluorescence species,
and it turns out

00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:29.140
that the light energy
from a aequorin

00:18:29.140 --> 00:18:32.830
actually can excite
the flourophore

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:34.930
in the green
fluorescent protein,

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:40.030
and then you emit the light of
the wavelength in the green.

00:18:40.030 --> 00:18:43.900
So it was actually a couple
pair of proteins, aequorin

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.910
and the second
thing that was just

00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.270
the green fluorescent protein,
and what was fascinating

00:18:49.270 --> 00:18:51.800
about this protein is more
and more work was done

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.610
is they didn't seem
to need any additives.

00:18:54.610 --> 00:18:57.790
So for bioluminescence,
you got to add ATP,

00:18:57.790 --> 00:19:02.800
and you've got to add,
you know, the luciferin.

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.650
You've got to add things
to see the fluorescence.

00:19:05.650 --> 00:19:08.600
What was unique about the
green fluorescent protein

00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.510
is it didn't need
anything to add.

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:12.922
You just had the protein,
and it was fluorescent.

00:19:12.922 --> 00:19:14.380
So what I want to
talk to you about

00:19:14.380 --> 00:19:17.430
is the molecular basis
of this fluorescent,

00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:21.070
and we'll also talk, though,
about the protein engineering

00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:24.220
that was systematically done
to make this more and more

00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:26.590
of a useful reagent.

00:19:26.590 --> 00:19:29.360
So Shimamura was
the first person.

00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.430
He had his kids collect
so many jellyfish

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:35.110
that they could extract the
green fluorescent protein

00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:38.440
through traditional
old-school biochemical methods

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.530
and grow crystals,
protein crystals.

00:19:41.530 --> 00:19:42.100
Guess what?

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:46.000
They are bright green, and we're
able to solve the structure.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.070
Once they had the
structure, they sort of

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.830
knew what was going
on with the jellyfish,

00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:54.640
and they were also able to
recognize a particular part

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:57.880
of the sequence of the green
fluorescent protein that

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.760
ended up being the
precursor to the fluorophore

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:04.090
that we see nowadays
and we understand.

00:20:04.090 --> 00:20:06.970
Originally, the protein
was not monomeric.

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:09.370
I'll talk to you a
bit about that later.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:11.740
For technology, it's
much more handy to have

00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:15.340
this protein as a monomore,
not as a dimer or a tetramer.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:17.720
That makes experiments
complicated,

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.420
but I'll show you
a very easy trick

00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:21.410
that was done to fix that.

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.290
And so the other people
who shared Nobel Prize

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:27.790
with Shimamura, who, by the
way, passed away just a couple

00:20:27.790 --> 00:20:30.730
of weeks ago, in fact,
but a an amazing old age.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:33.190
It must have been all
that digging for jellyfish

00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:35.650
that helped him live that long.

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:38.620
There was also Martin
Chalfie at Columbia,

00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:42.340
who demonstrated that the
gene for the green fluorescent

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.040
protein could be put in
all kinds of other animals,

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.930
organisms, C elegans bacteria
and they would fluoresce.

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:54.220
And a really major player
in this entire story

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:59.980
was Roger Tsien, who died
very young of a stroke, who

00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:04.540
was the chemist-biochemist who
put the pieces together said,

00:21:04.540 --> 00:21:08.640
if this is GFP, we can use it
for so many different things.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.680
So he really advanced
the technologies

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.840
of the applications.

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.920
So protein expression could be--
they realized quite early on

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.590
could just be programmed
into a protein

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:24.190
by just having the DNA for the
green fluorescent protein stuck

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:27.040
on to a favorite
protein of interest.

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:31.510
Then you would have that DNA
be transcribed, translated

00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.410
in the cell, and then your
favorite protein in the cell

00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:37.750
would fluoresce
green because it was

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.590
attached as a construct
with the other proteins.

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.590
So all of those things
became enabled quite quickly.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:48.800
This could be done in all
organisms, eukaryotes,

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:49.390
prokaryotes.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:54.400
It's pretty non-toxic, so
expressing a bunch of GFP

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.840
in a cell doesn't kill it.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.110
That's kind of handy.

00:21:57.110 --> 00:22:00.880
So it really is a
super vital system,

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.070
and it's visible in
all kinds of tissues.

00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.280
So what I'm going
to show you here

00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:09.130
are some of the seminal results,
first of all, the structure

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:12.070
we'll talk about
and then Chalfie

00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:16.450
was able to put the DNA
into proteins and bacteria,

00:22:16.450 --> 00:22:21.250
and, also, proteins that
were labeled in C elegans.

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.830
And the story of Chalfie
is kind of funny.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.770
He's one of those guys who
sort of didn't necessarily

00:22:26.770 --> 00:22:28.330
have all the
equipment he needed,

00:22:28.330 --> 00:22:30.010
but he knew this
was really exciting,

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.260
and he needed a
fluorescence microscope.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.180
So he would call up
all the companies who

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.430
sold microscopes
and, say, I'm really

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.190
thinking of buying this
fluorescent microscope.

00:22:39.190 --> 00:22:41.560
This particular one would be--

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.240
these are a couple
of hundred grand,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.020
you know, these are
not cheap things.

00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:48.970
And he'd talk the company into
putting a microscope in his lab

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.560
for a month as a demo.

00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:53.230
It's, like, you know,
saying to the car

00:22:53.230 --> 00:22:56.230
dealer you want to buy a car and
then driving a Ferrari around

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:58.090
for a month and then
saying, it's not really

00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:59.300
going to work for me.

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.900
So he collected
all his early data

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:05.580
on microscopes that were on
loan from Olympus and Leica

00:23:05.580 --> 00:23:07.040
and various other places.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.270
So that's a funny, funny twist.

00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.440
OK, so the fluorophore--

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:17.380
all right, so they could go
from DNA to protein sequence.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.360
Then they could look
at the structure

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:23.740
and see that the place in the
protein sequence that went

00:23:23.740 --> 00:23:26.530
serine, tyrosine, glycine.

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:29.900
So here we go--
serine, tyrosine.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.020
You recognize that one.

00:23:31.020 --> 00:23:33.410
It's the one with one
of the aromatic rings,

00:23:33.410 --> 00:23:35.750
glycine is the one
with no substituent.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:40.280
It was common in a
number of organisms,

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:43.880
mostly aquatic organisms
that fluoresce and seem

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.375
to be the origin of
the flourophore in GFP,

00:23:47.375 --> 00:23:50.000
and so the chemists got to work,
and you know what chemists do,

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:53.750
they start drawing arrows and
joining bonds and figuring out

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:56.990
how can we go from something
that's basically dead,

00:23:56.990 --> 00:23:58.760
and it's not got any
fluorescence at all

00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:00.710
for something
that's fluorescent.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:05.600
And so from the structure and
from working out the mechanism,

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:09.890
they basically found that this
little piece, this tripeptide

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:13.970
within the entire structure
of the DNA primary sequence,

00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:17.840
was able to cyclize through
that nitrogen attacking

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.690
that carbon and
then an elimination,

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:25.460
and then there was an
oxygen-dependent oxidation

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.590
to give you this structure.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:31.130
So if you look at this, you
can still see the serine.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:32.870
You kind of know
this was tyrosine,

00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:34.850
but it doesn't look
like it anymore,

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:37.990
and it turns out the glycine
was incredibly important.

00:24:37.990 --> 00:24:41.480
It doesn't look like it's
involved in the chromophore,

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.820
but when you have a
glycine in a sequence,

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.680
it allows you to do
some funny twists

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:48.320
and turns because it
has no substituents.

00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:50.960
So it allowed that loop to form.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:55.130
Once that loop is formed,
chemistry can occur.

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:57.050
If the glycine
wasn't there, things

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.840
might be not in
an ideal situation

00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.460
to form the fluorophore.

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:04.680
The oxidation to put
in that double bond

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.350
is oxygen dependent.

00:25:06.350 --> 00:25:08.570
So in some cases,
the fluorophore

00:25:08.570 --> 00:25:10.980
would mature a bit more slowly.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.280
So you would go from
the free state that's

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.160
not fluorescent to
the fluorescent state

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.160
quite slowly if you
withheld oxygen.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:23.480
So a lot of engineering was done
to improve the maturation time,

00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.260
to improve the photo physics.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.740
There's really cool
photophysical experiments that

00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.650
were done, but that's
the basis of it,

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:33.028
and the emission of
this flouorophore,

00:25:33.028 --> 00:25:35.570
you can almost recognize that
it's a fluorophore because it's

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:38.090
got a lot of what's
called conjugation

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:39.920
in organic chemistry--

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.870
one double bond,
another double bond

00:25:41.870 --> 00:25:44.720
stuck onto this ring with
multiple double bonds.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:47.840
And it emits at the same--
a similar wavelength

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:52.190
to the fluorophore fluoroscein,
so people were happy

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:57.200
because all the filters
on their microscopes

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.330
were the right ones.

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.060
If you just used the fluoroscein
filters, you would get a GFPC.

00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:04.800
So that really was made
in heaven for those guys.

00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:06.210
OK, so let's take
a look at this.

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:09.020
Here's the wire diagram of
the original crystallized

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.010
structure.

00:26:10.010 --> 00:26:12.050
I've planted a ribbon on there.

00:26:12.050 --> 00:26:13.520
I get rid of all
the side chains,

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.130
so you see this beautiful
dimer structure.

00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:18.320
Let's throw away
one of the dimers,

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.430
and you can start to look.

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:22.490
There's a little
something sneaky in there,

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:26.690
and as you get closer, you can
start to see the structure.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:28.970
There's this sort of
thread going through it.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:31.250
That's just a trace
of the backbone,

00:26:31.250 --> 00:26:33.880
but there is the structure
of the fluorophore.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.290
Here's the fluorophore
with the space filling,

00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:39.320
and what I think is kind of
cool is if you kind of twist

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.110
the GFP around, it's
kind of like a barrel,

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.790
and it looks like
a bird in a cage

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.830
because it's caged in there.

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:49.280
And to be honest,
it's the structure.

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.470
It's not just the structure
of the flourophore.

00:26:51.470 --> 00:26:54.790
It's the fact that the
fluorophore is inside

00:26:54.790 --> 00:26:56.810
a kind of hydrophobic
environment

00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.560
that makes it fluoresce.

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:02.240
I could go into the lab
and make that flourophore

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.830
and have it in a
beaker of methanol,

00:27:03.830 --> 00:27:05.450
and you wouldn't see anything.

00:27:05.450 --> 00:27:09.110
It's only in that environment
that's created in the GFP

00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.510
molecule, so it's fascinating.

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:16.610
The structure of GFP creates
the shape to cyclize,

00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.300
and it creates the environment
for good fluorescence.

00:27:20.300 --> 00:27:24.260
So he has a mass of animals
that have been labeled with GFP.

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:27.440
As you've seen, our mouse has
been labeled multiple times.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.080
This was the first GFP rabbit.

00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:31.400
He was known as Alba.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.730
He even had his own
name, but there's

00:27:34.730 --> 00:27:41.210
seaweeds and zebrafish and
mice from a letter, C elegans,

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:43.880
the famous, the fly.

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.960
What else?

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:49.530
I don't even know what these
things are, but Purkinje cells

00:27:49.530 --> 00:27:50.030
and so on.

00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:54.980
Anyway, so this shows you
the universality of the tool.

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.607
A brief mention about
the dimer problem, people

00:27:58.607 --> 00:28:00.190
looked at the structure
of the diamond

00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:02.240
from the crystal
structure and found

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:06.320
that there was a sticky face
between two monomers of GFP

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.500
that encouraged this
quaternary structure.

00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:12.710
And so they simply
changed two alanines that

00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:15.110
were sitting right at
the dimer interface, one

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.300
from one monomer and
one from the other,

00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.560
created a sticky patch.

00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.590
Sounds a bit like
hemoglobin, if you remember,

00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:23.330
the sickle cell hemoglobin.

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:26.060
They changed them to
lycines and [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:30.130
solved you had just
monomeric protein

00:28:30.130 --> 00:28:32.830
because when you do a lot
of experiments with GFP,

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:36.610
you don't want GFP randomly
dimerizing because it's

00:28:36.610 --> 00:28:40.270
going to change the biology of
the protein it's attached to.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:44.920
So this very, very easy
structure-driven engineering

00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.420
was perfect.

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:49.300
OK, so let's take a look at
some of the early things that

00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.050
could be done now.

00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.870
We take it all for
granted, but GFP

00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:57.290
can be used as a reporter
gene to do a number of things

00:28:57.290 --> 00:29:00.200
in cellular systems.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:05.140
So, for example, if you want
to study a regulatory sequence

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.510
to know whether this
promoter works well,

00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:11.170
you can put it at the
front end of the GFP gene

00:29:11.170 --> 00:29:14.890
and then see if the promoter
works under certain conditions,

00:29:14.890 --> 00:29:16.690
then the GFP will be produced.

00:29:16.690 --> 00:29:19.170
The cells will grow green.

00:29:19.170 --> 00:29:24.250
And this is a nice variant
to a luciferase-based system

00:29:24.250 --> 00:29:27.010
or a LacZ based system
where you're actually

00:29:27.010 --> 00:29:29.560
having to treat and
fix things in order

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.590
to do the LacZ experiments.

00:29:32.590 --> 00:29:36.880
So here's a really nice
example with C elegans.

00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:38.620
What you could do pre-GF--

00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:40.960
we really have--
it's like ADBC--

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:47.620
you know, anti whatever before
year 0 and after year 0.

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:51.960
The biological world is pre
GFP and post GFP, frankly,

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.830
the impact that it's
had on the system.

00:29:54.830 --> 00:29:56.440
So here is a C elegans.

00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.800
As you know, all the neurons
have names, and a lot of C

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.890
elegans biologists are
very familiar with each,

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:06.010
you know, single cell within
the C elegans, in particular,

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:07.060
the neurons.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:12.800
So this is a listing
of the touch receptors.

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:15.580
You could have an
antibody to those,

00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.400
and so you could do
some antibody staining,

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.910
but antibody staining, remember,
we got to fix the worms.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:22.830
They don't like that.

00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:26.200
You literally fix them
down and do the staining

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.380
with the antibody to
get inside the C elegans

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.800
to see the antibody
light up the proteins.

00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:37.870
You could do beta-gal activity,
same thing, but in both cases,

00:30:37.870 --> 00:30:39.520
these are dead C elegans.

00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.312
They're fixed.

00:30:40.312 --> 00:30:41.020
They're in place.

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.540
You can't observe
them going forward.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.700
But look instead,
that the images you

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.270
would get with GFP, where
you could totally pick out

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.050
all the touch receptors.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:54.190
And this is a situation
where an important protein

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:59.890
in those cells MEC-17 is
co expressed with GFP,

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.960
and you can see this
beautiful image,

00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.280
and the worms are still alive.

00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:06.770
You could totally watch
what was going on with them,

00:31:06.770 --> 00:31:08.770
and he just wants
you to know that he's

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:10.140
alive and well and kicking.

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:15.650
OK, now, progress has to happen.

00:31:15.650 --> 00:31:19.420
So one green protein
does not a history make.

00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:22.720
So, immediately,
with the identity

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:24.860
of the structure
of GFP, I am going

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.530
to go back really
quickly to look

00:31:26.530 --> 00:31:29.320
at that picture of
the structure for you.

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:31.030
Sorry about this
back and forward.

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:36.580
OK, the chemists realize that
if they change this tyrosine

00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:38.380
to some of the other
amino acids that

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:42.220
looked a little bit like it,
like phenylalanine, tryptophan,

00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.750
and histidine, they might
alter the photophysics

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:49.600
of this structure because
if you put tryptophan there,

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.670
there's even more double bonds.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:55.540
If you put phenylalanine
there, that OH is gone.

00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:58.918
So there's really opportunities,
and that's the chemists saying,

00:31:58.918 --> 00:32:00.460
I can look at this
protein structure,

00:32:00.460 --> 00:32:02.620
and I know the one
thing I can change

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:06.610
is to change that amino
acid back at the DNA level.

00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:10.690
So I'm going to change the
codon for tyrosine to the codons

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:14.200
for tryptophan,
phenylalanine, and histidine

00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.380
and then see what my fluorescent
protein looks like, OK?

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.580
Does that make sense?

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.560
So it was the one
thing that's obvious.

00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:24.090
I can fix this.

00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:26.970
So what they did was they
made the series of GFPs,

00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:29.130
and they transfected
cells, and they

00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:32.910
were able to see that
when you replaced

00:32:32.910 --> 00:32:40.650
various residues, for example,
tyrosine to tryptophan,

00:32:40.650 --> 00:32:42.210
tyrosine to histidine.

00:32:42.210 --> 00:32:45.600
There's a little bit
of variation here,

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.790
and don't worry about
this for a minute.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:51.570
They were able to
create bacteria

00:32:51.570 --> 00:32:55.440
that had been transfected
with the mutated GFPs

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.650
in order to give them
different colors of bacteria.

00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:01.590
So my question to you is,
if you look at these, this

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:03.720
would have been
the original GFP,

00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:05.340
except made a
little bit brighter

00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:08.880
by a small substitution,
which of these would emit

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.530
at the shortest wavelengths.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.480
So just look at
the colors, which

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.940
is the shortest
wavelength, which

00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:17.610
is the bacterium that
expresses the protein

00:33:17.610 --> 00:33:21.930
that emits at the
shortest wavelength.

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:24.000
You'd always be
provided a picture

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.520
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.850
Yeah, out there.

00:33:29.850 --> 00:33:30.650
AUDIENCE: The GFP.

00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, the
blue one, exactly.

00:33:32.450 --> 00:33:34.970
So you can look at the
spectrum, and you say, OK, I've

00:33:34.970 --> 00:33:37.050
got blue down here.

00:33:37.050 --> 00:33:38.150
There's that cyan.

00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:40.310
It's kind of a blue
green, and then I

00:33:40.310 --> 00:33:42.260
move towards the more yellow.

00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:46.410
So you can pick it out and
say, it's the lowest energy.

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:50.180
It's the shortest wavelength
emission, the highest energy

00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.410
emission.

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:54.320
OK, all right, and
these were the variance

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.930
that I just described while
I went back to the picture.

00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:00.050
So you could make a
blue one with histidine.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:03.440
You could make a cyan
one with tryptophan.

00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:07.280
You could preserve the
green one with tyrosine,

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.294
but a change in the
serine to a threonine just

00:34:10.294 --> 00:34:12.980
to improve the
photophysics, a long story.

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:15.300
I won't-- I'm happy
to chat about it.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.239
And, in fact, there
was one clever one

00:34:17.239 --> 00:34:20.290
where you couldn't really
make the protein yellow,

00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:23.690
but if you had the
tyrosine nearby sandwiched

00:34:23.690 --> 00:34:26.420
with the tyrosine and
the GFP chromophore,

00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:29.250
you could actually go as far
as the yellow flouorphore.

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:32.750
And that, in principle, should
make everybody really thrilled.

00:34:32.750 --> 00:34:36.052
It's always this situation
with protein engineering

00:34:36.052 --> 00:34:38.260
where you make something,
and it's a huge improvement

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.150
and then everyone says,
well, what else, you know?

00:34:41.150 --> 00:34:42.510
What's next?

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.760
We need red dyes.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.790
We need all kinds
of different dyes.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.780
So teams went back to
the oceans and actually

00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.679
collected organisms based
on the color they fluoresced

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:58.700
at, nice way to sample things.

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:02.690
And, actually, we were
able to ultimately discover

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:06.710
a red fluorescent protein
from the Discosoma

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.830
coral, the original
protein, DS red,

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:11.580
and if you look at
this kind of carefully,

00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:13.550
it looks a lot like GFP.

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:15.867
There's the tyrosine,
that funny ring.

00:35:15.867 --> 00:35:17.450
There's a double
bond there, but there

00:35:17.450 --> 00:35:21.500
is an additional double
bond down further

00:35:21.500 --> 00:35:26.270
into the sequence that extends
what we call the chromophore.

00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:27.770
And when you extend
the chromophore,

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.920
you're more likely to move
to longer wavelengths,

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:34.220
and that's how they got the red,
and then a bunch of engineering

00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:37.820
later, they got what's
called the fruits, which emit

00:35:37.820 --> 00:35:40.130
at all different wavelengths.

00:35:40.130 --> 00:35:42.500
Much of this was
not done rationally

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.670
because they went to nature.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:45.470
They found out what nature did.

00:35:45.470 --> 00:35:47.990
They got here, and
then they did a process

00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:50.270
known as gene shuffling,
where they mixed

00:35:50.270 --> 00:35:53.090
and matched portions
of genes to get them

00:35:53.090 --> 00:35:55.160
the entire color spectrum.

00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.860
They're not all
fabulous fluorophores.

00:35:57.860 --> 00:35:59.060
They have some problems.

00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:01.940
They bleach easily and so
on, but, nevertheless, this

00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:06.150
is a truly amazing
sort of outcome.

00:36:06.150 --> 00:36:09.770
OK, so and they enable
you to do art work

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:12.830
with fluorescent
proteins with bacteria,

00:36:12.830 --> 00:36:16.280
so you just paint your picture
and wait for the bacteria

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:20.270
to grow, and you would
have all those colors.

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:23.150
So fluorescent
proteins originally

00:36:23.150 --> 00:36:26.720
were very limited, originally
just green, then blue-green

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:29.900
and greenish yellow, but,
now, with the palette

00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:32.060
that's available, you
can color all kinds

00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.530
of organelles in different
types of colors, all right?

00:36:35.530 --> 00:36:38.690
OK, so now let's take
a couple of things.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:41.420
When we opened up this
class, we showed you

00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.310
a bunch of these pictures
because we wanted

00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:47.660
you to stay in 7016 with us to
see the cool things you'd see,

00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:50.790
and they were pretty much
what we would call eye candy.

00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:53.690
They look cool, but
how did we make them?

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:58.010
And, now, with the knowledge
of GFP and RFP and so on,

00:36:58.010 --> 00:37:01.592
you can say, OK, I understand
what this experiment is,

00:37:01.592 --> 00:37:03.050
and you can certainly
see that this

00:37:03.050 --> 00:37:05.250
is a super vital technique.

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.880
So what I want to ask is,
what are we looking at?

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:11.690
What is labeled to give
us this beautiful picture?

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:15.290
So you can sort of go down,
and there's a bunch of options,

00:37:15.290 --> 00:37:17.570
but, obviously,
anything where you

00:37:17.570 --> 00:37:21.200
think you're labeling DNA
with a fluorescent protein

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.080
is incorrect.

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.560
We're labeling at
the protein level.

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:28.160
We're making the DNA to express
the fluorescent protein,

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.700
but we're actually labeling
a protein as opposed to DNA.

00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:37.340
So A and B are out for sure,
but as we go through them,

00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:41.030
you can start to see
the chromatin is red

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:46.530
and the tubulin is green, so
the outcome there would be,

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:51.900
whoops, what we're observing--

00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.890
I thought what we're observing
is that the histones, which

00:37:55.890 --> 00:38:02.070
are the proteins
associated with chromatin,

00:38:02.070 --> 00:38:03.675
are labeled with a red protein.

00:38:03.675 --> 00:38:04.800
And you can see that there.

00:38:04.800 --> 00:38:07.260
Those are the chromatids,
and the tubulin,

00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:11.070
these green fibrils, is
associated with a GFP.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:15.450
So C would be the
correct answer there.

00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:18.390
And there's another one of
these cell division pictures.

00:38:18.390 --> 00:38:21.150
Once again, the same sort
of idea, but what I think

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:24.775
is really cool here, as
you can literally see,

00:38:24.775 --> 00:38:27.150
I love this picture because
there's this poor chromosome.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.310
It doesn't seem to be
able to get with the team.

00:38:29.310 --> 00:38:31.680
He's hanging down there,
and, eventually, just

00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.670
before cell division, it
seems like things work out OK

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:39.120
and cell division happens.

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:42.180
Now when you think
of this, the capacity

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:46.530
to watch this stuff in action
is really pretty amazing.

00:38:46.530 --> 00:38:49.180
This was another one.

00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:53.340
This a set of cell lines
where proteins in cell cycle

00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:54.450
are labeled.

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:57.630
You had a question on
exam three about proteins

00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:59.460
building up and going--

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:03.010
and going away during
parts of the cell cycle.

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:07.470
So, oftentimes, the
degradation of a protein

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:10.830
occurs when a protein gets
labeled with ubiquitin

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:13.310
by a ubiquitin
ligase, and then it

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:15.640
gets destined for degradation.

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.390
So the proteins that
you're seeing grow up

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:20.880
in phases of the cell
cycle are going away

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.790
because of the ubiquitin
proteasome system.

00:39:23.790 --> 00:39:27.720
So in these cells, particular
proteins have been labeled,

00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.320
and here you can
see the phases--

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.440
the components of the
cell cycle as proteins

00:39:34.440 --> 00:39:37.170
come and go through
cell division,

00:39:37.170 --> 00:39:40.320
and you can literally observe
where in the cell cycle

00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.390
each individual protein is.

00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:44.790
Why is this so
fascinating, I think,

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:47.880
in therapeutic development
is that you could literally

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:52.200
have drugs that might impact
aspects of the cell cycle,

00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:56.310
and you could watch them in
real time impact the imaging

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:59.130
that you see on this screen
with the red and the green

00:39:59.130 --> 00:40:02.550
because if you arrest at a
certain stage in cell cycle,

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:05.280
the cell will get stuck
at a particular color,

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:08.160
and you would even know which
phases, which parts of the cell

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.450
cycle, are being impacted.

00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:13.050
So I think that's a really
sort of captivating way

00:40:13.050 --> 00:40:15.840
to think of what you can
do with these proteins

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:19.470
because you can see
things in real time,

00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.550
dynamics of cellular systems.

00:40:22.550 --> 00:40:26.670
And I think, oh, and I'm going
to finish a few minutes early,

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:30.390
but I looked desperately
for a fluorescent turkey,

00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:31.770
and I couldn't find one.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:36.810
So I went with this light string
turkey and fluorescent colors.

00:40:36.810 --> 00:40:38.010
It seemed to fit the bill.

00:40:38.010 --> 00:40:41.940
All right, so please help
us finish up the bagels.

00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:46.200
Make sure you guys over there
get them and have a good break,

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:49.770
and I'm passing you
back to Professor Martin

00:40:49.770 --> 00:40:55.430
for Monday, which will be a
continuation of imaging, OK.

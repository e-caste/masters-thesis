00:00:20.815 --> 00:00:23.190
PROFESSOR: So last time we
were talking about heavy quark

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.450
effective theory, and we
phrased several motivations

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:29.700
for talking about heavy quark
effective theory related

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.180
to things that we hadn't
seen in effective theory yet.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.352
We also said that
our discussion here

00:00:35.352 --> 00:00:37.560
is more general than just
talking about heavy quarks.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.435
Heavy quarks is our
example, but we're really

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:43.420
thinking about having
some very heavy source.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.960
So you can think of it as
either a heavy particle

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.340
that you want to
leave in the theory--

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.150
So let me rewind.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.710
We talked about heavy particles
already, and what we did

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.850
is we integrated them out.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.220
We got rid of them.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.803
But what if you have
a heavy particle,

00:00:56.803 --> 00:00:58.410
and you actually
want to study it?

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.660
That's related to
this discussion.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.658
That's one way that
this is important.

00:01:02.658 --> 00:01:04.200
If you have a heavy
particle that you

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.030
want to study at low energies.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.920
Or you could just have a source,
a static source of some quantum

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.720
number, in this case, color.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.105
And this would be the right
way of thinking about it.

00:01:15.105 --> 00:01:16.980
So those are kind of
some of the motivations,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.272
and then there was also some
more technical motivations

00:01:19.272 --> 00:01:21.610
of things that we wanted
to see with this theory.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.000
So we started by saying it's
a top-down approach, so we

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.480
should be able to just take QCD
and take the limit and expand.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.988
But it's a little more tricky
than it was so far with, like,

00:01:30.988 --> 00:01:33.030
light quark masses for
chiral perturbation theory

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.070
because the mass is
in the numerator,

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.370
and we want to take the limit
that it goes to infinity, OK?

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:41.430
So we put a question mark
beside this equation,

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.390
and we started instead thinking
about expanding the propagator.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.000
So if we write the propagator
out for a heavy quark,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.830
you've got mass terms in the
numerator and the denominator.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.420
And when you expand
it out, after using

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.260
the equation of motion
and expanding with

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.620
p equals mQ v plus k.

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.810
So we introduced a vector,
v. v squared was 1.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.270
And then we introduce
some fluctuations, k.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.830
So there's m's hiding in
this p as well as that p.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.900
The quadratic term in
the denominator cancels.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.947
There's a linear
term that survives.

00:02:23.947 --> 00:02:25.530
There's linear terms
in the numerator.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.590
The linear terms, once I
just look at what they give,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.492
they give this
first contribution.

00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:32.200
And then there's some
higher-order terms.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.300
Then we drop them.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.800
OK?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.625
So for the propagator we had no
problem taking the heavy quark

00:02:37.625 --> 00:02:40.590
limit, and we got
out this expression.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.930
We also then thought
about the vertex.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.980
It's the gluon coupling
to a quark, heavy quark.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.050
And if this is the result in
QCD, this 1 plus v slash over 2

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.670
is a projector.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.610
But that means if you square
it, you get back the same thing.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.110
And we said, well, if there's
two propagators on either side

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.402
of this thing, I can think
about it putting a projector

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:05.940
on either side of this
thing, and that gives you

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.830
this result with just a v mu.

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.330
OK?

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.190
So the Feynman rule
for this guy can

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.710
be simplified by using the
fact that on either side of it

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.170
are sitting these projectors.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.180
And if you take those
two facts into account,

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.350
we can actually encode
them in a Lagrangian.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.890
We could just write it down, OK?

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.890
We want a Lagrangian that
gives that propagator,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.390
the lowest-order propagator,
and that lowest-order vertex.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.770
And that's what this is.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:38.160
So the v dot D has in it a v dot
A. v dot A is giving this guy.

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.370
So that's the v
dot A inside there.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.060
And then 1 over v dot k, that's
the v dot partial, right?

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.640
So i v dot D equals
i v dot partial.

00:03:58.565 --> 00:04:00.190
I don't know which
sign I'm using here,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:01.523
but I think it's the minus sign.

00:04:01.523 --> 00:04:03.080
AUDIENCE: I think
you're using plus.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.997
PROFESSOR: Using plus?

00:04:03.997 --> 00:04:05.372
AUDIENCE: No,
you're using minus.

00:04:05.372 --> 00:04:06.403
PROFESSOR: Using minus.

00:04:06.403 --> 00:04:07.820
I'll switch
throughout the course.

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.950
In each chapter I'll use a
different sign convention

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:10.992
to keep you on your toes.

00:04:10.992 --> 00:04:14.740
[CHUCKLES] In this chapter,
I will stick with this sign

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.329
convention, since
the source that we're

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.240
using for the reading is
using this sign convention.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.740
OK?

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.380
So this is the v dot A,
and this is the v dot k

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.230
that we have over there.

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:29.240
Now, I've encoded--
the way I encoded

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.740
the projection
relation, as I said,

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.510
let's work in terms of
a four-component field.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.480
So our field, Qv, still
has four components,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.400
but it satisfies this relation.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.860
And that actually projects
it down onto two components,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.943
and we'll talk more about
what the physics of this

00:04:41.943 --> 00:04:42.950
is in a minute.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.740
This is very convenient when
talking about heavy quarks

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.800
because you often want to couple
heavy quarks to light quarks,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.380
and if the light quarks
are four-component spinors,

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.810
it's easy to couple
them to the heavy quarks

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.940
if you have heavy
quark fields which

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.770
are four-component spinors.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.520
So you could work in terms of
a two-component Lagrangian that

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.950
doesn't have this
projection relation,

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.170
but for technical
reasons it's better

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:08.510
to work in terms of
the four-component one.

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:10.640
Makes things simpler.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.850
So that's in some sense
an indirect derivation

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:17.390
of the leading-order
HQET Lagrangian.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.500
Is there any
questions about that?

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.458
AUDIENCE: What if you
don't have the propagator

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:22.373
on the other side?

00:05:22.373 --> 00:05:24.290
PROFESSOR: What if I
don't have the propagator

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.490
on the other side?

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.010
Yeah, so we'll talk about
the spinors in a minute,

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.155
but it's the same
story for the spinors,

00:05:31.155 --> 00:05:33.530
that they have a projection
in relation, which is exactly

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.270
the same projection relation.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.870
So whether it's a
line sticking out

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.710
or whether it's attached to
something else, it's the same.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.475
OK, so let's now go and derive
the same thing directly.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.900
And the trick we're going
to do is the following.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.370
We need to cancel out this m
in the numerator, and the place

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.240
that m hides is in the
p in this formula here.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.940
So if we think about
some field that's

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:12.420
fluctuating in spacetime, we
can pull out from that field

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:16.470
the analog of that big piece,
p, if we pull out a phase

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:17.790
factor that looks like that.

00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:30.090
So let me just
write this-- so far

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.350
this is just some
redefinition of these objects

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:35.770
on the right-hand side.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:39.570
And I'm setting up two
objects here because I want--

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:46.260
I'm going to break the field
into these two pieces that obey

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.760
different projection relations.

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:53.990
OK?

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.330
So if I sum these two
up, the v slashes cancel.

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.645
Qv plus-- These are just
two components of the--

00:06:59.645 --> 00:07:03.140
I've just split it by two
orthogonal projectors,

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:04.250
two pieces.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:05.960
And I've pulled out
this piece here.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.300
And the reason that I
pulled out this piece here

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.940
is the analog of what
I did here with the p,

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.105
where I divided it into a
big piece and a small piece.

00:07:15.105 --> 00:07:17.480
This is going to take care of
pulling out that big piece.

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.280
OK, so if we want to take the
limit here in this equation.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.900
So far we've written out
what the Q's will be.

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.250
We also have to write
out what the D slash is.

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:35.930
So it's convenient to do the
following with the D slash.

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:37.055
Break it into two pieces--

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.580
a piece along v and a
piece orthogonal to v.

00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:50.340
So the definition
here of D transverse

00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:56.180
is that it's D minus
the piece along v,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:00.570
so if you like that v
dot D transverse is 0.

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:02.120
That's what I mean.

00:08:07.308 --> 00:08:08.850
With these relations
up here, there's

00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.472
also another way of writing
them that I should write down,

00:08:11.472 --> 00:08:12.930
as well, which is
a little simpler.

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:17.850
If I rearrange these formulas, I
can also write as v slash on Qv

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:27.355
is Qv, and v slash
on Bv is minus Bv.

00:08:27.355 --> 00:08:29.035
So there's a 1 on
this side, and if I

00:08:29.035 --> 00:08:30.660
come at it with the
half and put things

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.785
together that's what I get.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.885
OK, so let's put those
things together into here,

00:08:37.885 --> 00:08:40.010
and then we'll figure out
if we can take the limit.

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:47.580
And the crucial thing,
really, for being

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:49.740
able to take the limit is
to pull out this phase,

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:53.490
and we'll talk about what
physically is happening there

00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.460
in a minute, once
we've done the algebra.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.040
OK, so just plugging those
pieces together, we have that.

00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:30.880
Pull the phase through.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:38.890
So pull this negative
phase through these terms.

00:09:38.890 --> 00:09:41.590
With this v dot D, when
it hits the v dot x,

00:09:41.590 --> 00:09:43.596
we get some extra contribution.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.120
And I can group it
together with this mQ term

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.200
because what it does is
it brings down an mQ.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.558
The D transverse gives no
derivative, no contribution,

00:09:58.558 --> 00:10:00.600
when it hits that phase
because of this relation.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.560
So pulling the phase through,
the only term we pick up

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.080
is this minus 1 here.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:16.310
And I just grouped
it together-- sorry.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:19.715
The only term we pick
up is this v slash here,

00:10:19.715 --> 00:10:22.400
and that comes from this
v dot D hitting that term.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:28.660
All right?

00:10:28.660 --> 00:10:34.390
So now we put these pieces
together, multiply things out,

00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:38.530
and use the fact
that I've divided up

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:41.707
the field into these two
pieces that have different--

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:44.290
I know how v slash acts on them,
so I can get rid of all the v

00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:46.630
slashes by just
using the formula.

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:51.340
When v minus 1 acts
on Qv, I get 0, OK?

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:54.100
So for that term, for the
term that has two Qv's, I just

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:58.060
have the v slash i v dot D.
You can also prove that when

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:03.040
you have the Qv and the Qv bar
that this term actually is 0,

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:06.040
and to prove that you
basically use the projection

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:12.310
relation and the fact that if
I have 1 plus v slash over 2 D

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:17.890
transverse, that that can
be written as D transverse

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.690
1 minus v slash over 2.

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:25.200
Again, using this formula and
the fact that gamma matrices

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:27.220
anticommute.

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.890
And then 1 minus v
slash over 2 kills Qv,

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:34.870
and so a term like this one
between these fields is absent,

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:37.480
and the only term with
two Qv's is that one.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.430
Likewise, with Bv's
it's the same story.

00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:48.280
I don't get a D transverse term.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:53.350
But here, the mQ term does
survive, and it doubles,

00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:55.190
so the v slash gives
another minus 1,

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:57.940
so there's 2mQ sitting there.

00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.920
And then there's the
transverse terms,

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.626
and they come in
the cross terms.

00:12:02.626 --> 00:12:07.060
So Qv Bv.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.190
If I have this, then
this projection relation

00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:11.690
won't get rid of it because,
if I have a 1 plus v slash over

00:12:11.690 --> 00:12:13.690
2 on the right, it becomes
the correct projector

00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:17.380
for the other field on the
left, and then vice versa.

00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:26.770
OK?

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:33.780
So there's four terms here, and
we've simplified things as much

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.040
as we can.

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.700
So now let's think about what
these fields are describing.

00:12:45.258 --> 00:12:46.800
In particular, let's
think about what

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.935
would happen if we only
had external Qv fields.

00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:13.610
So if we consider only
external Qv fields,

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.470
then we can think about what
happens as mQ goes to infinity.

00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.630
And if you have a term--

00:13:24.630 --> 00:13:26.983
so as m goes to infinity,
nothing happens to this term.

00:13:26.983 --> 00:13:28.400
We have to figure
out what happens

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.930
to those terms over there.

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:31.790
But this guy here, it's
clear what happens.

00:13:31.790 --> 00:13:36.050
We get a field that has a mass,
mQ, and that particles are just

00:13:36.050 --> 00:13:38.310
getting heavier and heavier,
and they're decoupling.

00:13:38.310 --> 00:13:40.685
And when you get particles
that get heavy, they decouple.

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:49.410
So Bv decouples in this limit.

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.000
So diagrammatically,
think about it like this.

00:13:56.340 --> 00:13:58.070
You have a Qv.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:01.640
It could switch into a Bv with
one of these D slash vertices,

00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:05.000
and then back to a Qv, and this
would give some kind of diagram

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.720
from this Lagrangian, which
has external Qv fields.

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:12.020
But the Bv field has a 1
over m-type propagator,

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:18.072
and so this goes like 1
over m, and hence goes to 0.

00:14:18.072 --> 00:14:20.030
And that's one way of
talking about decoupling,

00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:22.490
that intermediate
particles of that type

00:14:22.490 --> 00:14:26.550
are giving diagrams that
are suppressed by 1 over m.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:27.980
OK?

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:31.250
And you see here,
sitting right here,

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:32.850
you see our Lagrangian
that we want,

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:36.045
which is the Qv i v dot D Bv.

00:14:36.045 --> 00:14:37.670
So if we just threw
away the Bv fields,

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.378
we would get the
Lagrangian that we want.

00:15:01.315 --> 00:15:03.440
So physically what's going
on with these two fields

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.520
is that Qv corresponds
to the particles, OK?

00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:08.930
We have a heavy quark.

00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:12.170
It's got particles that are of
that mass and that flavor that

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.630
are heavy, and it has
antiparticles, too.

00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:17.210
Qv corresponds to the
particles, and Bv corresponds

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:18.290
to the antiparticles.

00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.570
So-- of this flavor.

00:15:48.390 --> 00:15:51.090
And by making the phase
redefinition that we did,

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.970
we chose to focus on
on-shell fluctuations that

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:55.500
are close to the particles.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:58.620
If we'd chosen the
opposite phase, plus i,

00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:01.367
then we could expand
about the antiparticles,

00:16:01.367 --> 00:16:03.450
and things would have
worked out the opposite way.

00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:11.510
So I'll come back to that a
little bit more in a second.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.600
So let's have several
discussion points here.

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.800
So what we did is we made
a field redefinition, which

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.645
we were always allowed to do.

00:16:26.645 --> 00:16:27.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.360
AUDIENCE: Isn't Qv
like a [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.130
eigenstate of positive helicity?

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.030
And the other one--

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:38.530
PROFESSOR: We're talking
about heavy particles,

00:16:38.530 --> 00:16:40.238
so helicity is not
such a good thing to--

00:16:40.238 --> 00:16:44.080
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:46.200
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I'll talk
more about it in a sec.

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:46.700
Yeah.

00:16:49.484 --> 00:16:51.480
Yeah, give me a minute,
and then if you still

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.640
have a question after I
talk about it, then ask.

00:16:56.430 --> 00:16:59.100
So first of all, what we
did here was tree level.

00:17:18.450 --> 00:17:18.950
OK?

00:17:18.950 --> 00:17:21.650
So when we make this
type of redefinition

00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:24.319
and we go through this
algebra, it's all tree level.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:26.450
Not thinking about
any loops here.

00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:28.130
There will be
corrections to this story

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.630
once we start
talking about loops,

00:17:29.630 --> 00:17:31.940
and there will be
corrections to this story,

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.452
namely that we
just get the same L

00:17:34.452 --> 00:17:38.660
HQET once we want to take
into account one of our m

00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:42.600
corrections, and will come
back to both of those points.

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:45.890
So both of those things
to be discussed later.

00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:48.380
What we do do with L HQET--

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.750
as we described
correctly, the couplings

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:09.530
to gluons at leading order.

00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:17.240
And often what people are
interested in with k mu here

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:22.190
is k mu of order lambda QCD,
separating the scale lambda

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.710
QCD that has to do with the
confinement into a meson,

00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:27.500
like a B meson, from the
scale of the heavy quark.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:43.861
OK, so the antiparticles
are being removed,

00:18:43.861 --> 00:18:45.070
which is point number 2.

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:59.968
So if you want to ask what is
it that we're integrating out

00:18:59.968 --> 00:19:02.260
in this theory, we're not
integrating out the particle,

00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.000
because we want to study it.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.960
We're integrating
out the antiparticle.

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:11.430
It's easiest to see that if
you go to the rest frame.

00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:20.520
So taking v rest frame,
which is just 1, 0, 0, 0,

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:26.790
just timelike component, then
our 1 plus v slash becomes a--

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:31.170
so if you have 1 plus v
slash, then that's just 1

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:33.343
plus gamma 0 over 2.

00:19:33.343 --> 00:19:35.760
And if you want to talk about
particles and antiparticles,

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.360
the best representation to use
is the Dirac representation

00:19:39.360 --> 00:19:40.710
because then the particles--

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:48.190
So let's take a spinor in
the Dirac representation.

00:19:48.190 --> 00:19:50.980
Could be part of this field.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:53.530
Could just be a spinor
for an external state.

00:19:53.530 --> 00:20:00.400
In the Dirac
representation, what

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.280
happens is that you
have the guys that

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:06.257
are the particles in
the upper two components

00:20:06.257 --> 00:20:08.590
and the guys that are the
antiparticles in the lower two

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:10.510
components.

00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:14.136
So this is particles.

00:20:14.136 --> 00:20:15.750
This is antiparticles.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:21.508
This guy is always
projecting in the rest frame

00:20:21.508 --> 00:20:23.050
into the particles
and antiparticles.

00:20:23.050 --> 00:20:25.175
It's just that if you read
in other representations

00:20:25.175 --> 00:20:26.980
you'd have more
trouble seeing that,

00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:30.670
but in the Dirac representation
we just have a 0, OK?

00:20:30.670 --> 00:20:33.690
So this is one way of
thinking about what

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:34.690
this projector is doing.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:36.633
It's getting rid of
the antiparticles.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.830
So the way you should
think about this physically

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:51.250
is that, if you're
studying some process,

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:57.460
you're studying heavy particles
close to their mass shell.

00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:14.080
What we're doing is we're
measuring fluctuations

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.150
near the heavy mass, mQ.

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:20.440
We're perturbing about mQ.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:22.810
If you're perturbing about
mQ, the antiparticles

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.530
are very far away because the
splitting between the particles

00:21:26.530 --> 00:21:30.047
and the antiparticles is 2mQ.

00:21:30.047 --> 00:21:31.630
So that's why they
get integrated out.

00:21:37.150 --> 00:21:52.872
So that's why, in this
language of being near mQ,

00:21:52.872 --> 00:21:54.580
the antiparticles are
just very far away,

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.950
and we don't want
them in our theory.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:01.180
One way of talking about
that is pair creation.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.880
So if we draw some type of
Time-Ordered Perturbation

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:08.100
Theory diagram for
pair creation--

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:13.450
so it's not a Feynman diagram,
but a TOPT diagram, just so we

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.000
can talk about a definite
intermediate state

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.840
at a definite time, then
this intermediate state here

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.970
has three heavy
particles, and it has--

00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:26.800
If this guy has mQ and this
guy has mQ, this guy has 3mQ.

00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:34.510
So this intermediate
state is off-shell by 2mQ.

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:50.770
Time-ordered perturbation
theory diagram.

00:22:53.265 --> 00:22:55.390
So I can talk about whether
something is definitely

00:22:55.390 --> 00:22:58.210
a particle or definitely
an antiparticle.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.790
And another way of seeing this
2mQ that I'm talking about

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:04.240
is, like, just to do
vacuum polarization, where

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.360
you have 2mQ.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.380
You need 2mQ of energy to
fluctuate into a heavy quark

00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:09.880
pair.

00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.280
So we have a very light
gluon, and it just

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:24.000
doesn't have the
energy to do that,

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.407
so pair creation is not
part of this theory, OK?

00:23:30.407 --> 00:23:32.990
So now you can ask your question
if you still have a question.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:35.640
[CHUCKLES] Yeah.

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:36.140
All right?

00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:41.232
So the thing we're getting
rid of is the antiparticle.

00:23:41.232 --> 00:23:43.190
Now, because we're getting
really antiparticle,

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.985
we no longer have an
annihilation process.

00:23:45.985 --> 00:23:47.360
So unlike QCD,
where you can have

00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:50.830
particles and
antiparticles annihilate,

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.840
here we have actually
a conservation rule

00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:54.400
for the number of
heavy particles.

00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.740
We're talking here about quarks.

00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:11.760
The number of heavy
quarks is preserved,

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.950
and that's an extra
symmetry that this theory

00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:29.840
has that QCD didn't have.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.420
OK?

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:42.030
So the conservation law for the
number of heavy quarks is u1.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:45.840
More generally,
we can extend this

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.338
to something called
heavy quark symmetry.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.670
So let's-- since we notice that
there's this conservation law,

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:57.850
let's think about what the
biggest group we can come up

00:24:57.850 --> 00:25:03.160
with is that describes the
symmetry of this L HQET.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:10.420
So this u1 that preserves
the heavy quarks

00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:11.380
is a flavor symmetry.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.660
And depending on how many
heavy particles we have,

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:19.360
it could be bigger than a u1.

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:27.340
So actually, it's a uNh
for Nh heavy quarks.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:32.530
So you could have
some heavy sources

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:34.190
that live under some group.

00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:36.618
And if you have N
types of those sources,

00:25:36.618 --> 00:25:37.660
you'd have a uN symmetry.

00:25:43.030 --> 00:25:45.505
And the root of this is
that we got rid of mQ.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.380
mQ was the thing that
would break this symmetry,

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.450
but it disappeared.

00:25:55.450 --> 00:25:57.570
And once it's gone,
we don't care.

00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:02.800
We don't know whether the
thing was a charm quark or a B

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.140
quark or a top quark.

00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:08.110
We don't see the
flavor of the quark

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.210
anymore because
the mass term was

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.460
what was tracking that
flavor, and now it's gone,

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.143
and we just end up
with this theory that

00:26:14.143 --> 00:26:15.560
doesn't remember
about the flavor,

00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.170
so we have a flavor symmetry.

00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:18.670
OK?

00:26:18.670 --> 00:26:21.340
So that's kind of
cool as an example

00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:23.320
of having an effective
theory where there's

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.120
an emergent symmetry,
symmetry that

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:29.290
wasn't so apparent in the
theory you started with but is

00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.210
apparent once you get
to the effective theory.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:43.250
The other example
is spin symmetry.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:45.610
There's actually an
su2 spin symmetry

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:49.130
because the Lagrangian didn't
involve any D slashes anymore.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:55.840
It just became scalar,
the v dot D. So

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.290
if we think about
our heavy part--

00:26:57.290 --> 00:26:59.080
so we think about a
four-component spinor.

00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:00.760
Two degrees of freedom
have to do with particle

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:01.630
versus antiparticle.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:04.870
The other two have to
do with spin, a half.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.618
And we don't care
about the spin,

00:27:06.618 --> 00:27:08.785
either, because our Lagrangian
is completely scalar.

00:27:25.370 --> 00:27:25.870
OK?

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:32.410
We just had Qv i v dot
D Qv, and there was no--

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.110
we didn't mention-- the v dot
D doesn't have any D slash.

00:27:35.110 --> 00:27:38.120
It doesn't have any
spin matrices in it, OK?

00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:41.210
So that's an su2 symmetry.

00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:44.390
So if we want to talk
about that again,

00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:47.860
it's useful to think about
it in the rest frame.

00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:53.140
In the rest frame, the heavy
quark spin transformation.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:06.310
Need some Dirac
representation, which is gamma

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:07.540
phi, gamma 0, gamma i.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:10.690
It's just the Pauli
matrices, sigma i.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:15.550
And you could think of making
a transformation related

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:16.690
to the spin.

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:18.880
So the infinitesimal version
of that transformation

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:19.755
would look like this.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:24.190
Start with Qv.

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:25.540
Do a rotation.

00:28:25.540 --> 00:28:29.860
Ask, does this change
the Lagrangian?

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.460
And the statement
is that it changed

00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:35.830
the Lagrangian
that you get, which

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:40.750
is i v dot D commutator
i epsilon dot sQ.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.410
But i v dot D is just this
scalar quantity and just

00:28:47.410 --> 00:28:51.555
commutes through this
epsilon dot sQ, OK?

00:28:51.555 --> 00:28:54.055
So that's the formal statement
that there's a spin symmetry.

00:29:02.690 --> 00:29:05.780
Since we're using this kind
of projected formalism,

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:07.230
you could ask the
question, well,

00:29:07.230 --> 00:29:11.210
maybe this spin symmetry is
mixing up the heavy quark

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:14.960
components with the
other components,

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.945
these zero components, but
you can check that it doesn't.

00:29:18.945 --> 00:29:22.910
It's actually acting within
the subcategory, which is just

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:25.790
describing the heavy quark.

00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:28.400
So you can also check it.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.900
One way of phrasing
that is that you

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:32.520
can check that this is true.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.360
So that the rotated field
still satisfies the projection

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:35.860
relation.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.320
So really, this is
a rotation that's

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.870
within the two-component
subspace that

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:48.440
are describing the physical
degrees of freedom.

00:29:52.910 --> 00:29:53.410
OK?

00:29:53.410 --> 00:29:56.590
So there's this enhanced
symmetry group of this theory.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.340
And we can put it together
because nothing stops us

00:30:03.340 --> 00:30:06.230
from doing this, or doing
this, or doing a bit of both,

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:07.480
so we can build one big group.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:20.007
So all together,
you have a u2Nh,

00:30:20.007 --> 00:30:21.340
and that's heavy quark symmetry.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:36.530
A Qv field is a
fundamental in that group.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:42.860
So [INAUDIBLE] spinors
look like this,

00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.170
with some number of components,
and this guy could be--

00:30:46.170 --> 00:30:50.570
for example, maybe this
is a B quark with spin up.

00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.580
And then some other
component might

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:01.630
be a charm quark with spin up
or a B quark with spin down.

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:04.550
That's what heavy
quark symmetry is.

00:31:04.550 --> 00:31:05.050
OK?

00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:07.610
So any questions about that?

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:11.230
So we'll talk a bit more
about how you actually

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.570
make predictions related to
this heavy quark symmetry.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:14.987
As you saw, it's
kind of emergent,

00:31:14.987 --> 00:31:16.450
and so you should
build some tools

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:19.780
for seeing what kind of impact
that has on observables,

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:22.990
and we'll spend a little bit
of time doing that today.

00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:25.270
But before we do that,
let's continue our list.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.545
So when we made this
field redefinition,

00:31:30.545 --> 00:31:32.837
we pulled out this phase,
and that phase depended on v.

00:31:32.837 --> 00:31:38.210
And we also stuck a
label v on the field.

00:31:38.210 --> 00:31:46.310
So we had this v mu, which
appeared on our field, OK?

00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:48.873
And that was just a
reminder that we pulled out

00:31:48.873 --> 00:31:51.040
a phase, and the phase
depending on our choice of v,

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:54.970
and we could make actually
different choices.

00:31:54.970 --> 00:31:57.010
This v mu is actually
something quite useful

00:31:57.010 --> 00:32:03.040
because it isn't changed when
you talk about low-energy QCD

00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.057
interactions.

00:32:05.057 --> 00:32:06.265
So it's a conserved quantity.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:27.760
So in our notation of
dividing up p into mQv plus k,

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:28.390
this changes.

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:36.820
So if you tickle with very
soft gluons the heavy quark,

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:39.770
you can't change this term,
but you can change that term.

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:42.670
So the v term is not affected
by the gluon interactions.

00:32:42.670 --> 00:32:45.130
It's a conserved
quantity, and hence

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:46.780
having it as a
label on our field

00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.760
tells us what v
we're talking about.

00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.258
Basically, what v
signifies is you

00:32:50.258 --> 00:32:52.300
could talk about a heavy
quark in its rest frame,

00:32:52.300 --> 00:32:54.220
and then you could
talk about tickling it.

00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:56.920
Or it could be moving with
some constant velocity,

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.250
and you could talk about that
moving frame tickling it.

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:02.860
And any such choice
is equally valid,

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:04.880
and that's what v is encoding.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.380
OK?

00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.730
But we can formulate tickling a
heavy quark in any given frame

00:33:09.730 --> 00:33:12.823
that we'd like, and
v is encoding that.

00:33:12.823 --> 00:33:14.990
Things are kind of natural
to see in the rest frame,

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:16.823
but we don't have to
work in the rest frame,

00:33:16.823 --> 00:33:19.214
and that's what v is encoding.

00:33:19.214 --> 00:33:20.060
OK?

00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.730
So that's kind of different
than we've seen before.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:28.340
What's the power counting?

00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.720
Power counting is not
so difficult here.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.420
It's just powers of 1 over mQ.

00:33:38.050 --> 00:33:40.160
So our leading-order
Lagrangian had

00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.020
no mQ's and then we could
formulate corrections

00:33:45.020 --> 00:33:47.420
to that leading order, and
they would be suppressed

00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.550
by powers of 1 over mQ.

00:33:51.962 --> 00:33:54.045
So let's think about that
in a little more detail.

00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:01.860
So if you take the field Q
of x and you write the mode

00:34:01.860 --> 00:34:03.090
expansion for the field--

00:34:18.915 --> 00:34:20.540
but there's this
term, and then there's

00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:23.840
a term that involves
the antiparticles.

00:34:28.150 --> 00:34:30.340
What we did with
the Q of x field--

00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.320
that's the full theory field--

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.865
is we pulled out this phase.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.130
And the phase that we
pulled out was just

00:34:40.130 --> 00:34:44.114
something that depended
on a fixed quantity, m v,

00:34:44.114 --> 00:34:45.739
so it would come
outside that integral.

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:53.560
So we pulled out--

00:35:00.307 --> 00:35:02.390
so you can think about
really literally sticking p

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.780
into this formula and then
pulling out that phase.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:15.210
And then that leaves, in Q v,
just the e to the minus i k dot

00:35:15.210 --> 00:35:15.710
x.

00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:21.060
OK?

00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:25.620
So if you think about
derivatives on Qv of x,

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.130
then they are scaling like k.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.860
And this guy here
has no mQ's in it.

00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.728
So there's no mQ's
in the derivatives.

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:45.720
So if we build operators
out of this Qv field,

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.600
if we let derivatives
act on that field,

00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.180
there's no factors of the heavy
quark mass hiding anywhere

00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:52.710
in those derivatives.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:56.400
That's the magic of making this
kind of phase redefinition.

00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:59.610
We've made the mQ's explicit
by pulling that out so that we

00:35:59.610 --> 00:36:04.170
could get something remaining
that doesn't have any mQ's.

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.743
Since we want to count
mQ's what we want to do

00:36:06.743 --> 00:36:08.910
is we want to make all the
mQ's very, very explicit.

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:11.220
We don't want any to
be hiding anywhere,

00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:13.920
and that's what we were
doing before with this field

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:18.640
redefinition, was making
all the mQ's explicit.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:21.090
This is one example of
why that's important.

00:36:21.090 --> 00:36:25.103
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:25.103 --> 00:36:25.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:37.500
So you should-- if you
think about the action--

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:39.203
yeah, if you think
about the action

00:36:39.203 --> 00:36:41.370
and you thought about making
a gauge transformation,

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:43.703
you could worry about making
a gauge transformation that

00:36:43.703 --> 00:36:46.570
would inject too much
momentum into your field

00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:49.950
so that it no longer described
low-energy degrees of freedom.

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:53.527
But usually people don't talk
about that so much in HQET,

00:36:53.527 --> 00:36:55.485
so we'll save that
discussion for [INAUDIBLE],,

00:36:55.485 --> 00:36:58.570
but we will have it.

00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:03.300
So the coordinate, x-- one way
of thinking about this equation

00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:06.090
is that the coordinate
x that's in Qv really

00:37:06.090 --> 00:37:09.030
corresponds to variations that
are the low-energy variations.

00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:18.350
So our field is
doing what we want.

00:37:18.350 --> 00:37:20.420
It's describing
low-energy fluctuations.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.750
And that's another way of
thinking about the fact

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:32.304
that there's no mQ's
in this derivative.

00:37:37.250 --> 00:37:46.100
So if we look at
subleading operators and--

00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:49.240
if we look at
subleading Lagrangians

00:37:49.240 --> 00:38:04.910
and external operators,
all the powers of m Q

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.340
are going to be
explicit, and that

00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:10.040
makes doing the power counting
quite simple because we just

00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.360
look at them and count.

00:38:14.852 --> 00:38:16.935
So as long as we're sure
that they're all explicit

00:38:16.935 --> 00:38:20.390
and none are hiding anywhere,
then it's easy to count.

00:38:20.390 --> 00:38:23.210
There will be logs of mQ
hiding in Wilson coefficients,

00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:24.480
but we're not counting logs.

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.480
If we're just counting
powers, then what I said

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.948
is sufficient, OK?

00:38:29.948 --> 00:38:31.490
So is there any
questions about that?

00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:37.233
So there's actually
one mQ that's hiding,

00:38:37.233 --> 00:38:40.530
and we should be a little
bit careful about it.

00:38:40.530 --> 00:38:42.110
So if we talk about
states, there's

00:38:42.110 --> 00:38:43.430
actually an mQ hiding in there.

00:38:50.880 --> 00:38:55.020
So let's think about states
of some particle that's

00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.370
relativistically normalized.

00:38:56.370 --> 00:38:58.860
It could be a heavy meson.

00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:03.840
Let me just call it H. And
the usual normalization

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:08.070
convention for a
relativistic particle

00:39:08.070 --> 00:39:18.580
is this one for the states.

00:39:18.580 --> 00:39:20.330
So this guy, if you
look at the dimensions

00:39:20.330 --> 00:39:23.030
of the right-hand
side here, you've

00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:26.000
got minus 3 plus 1 is
minus 2, so each of these

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.300
is dimension minus 1.

00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.340
So that's one thing
we can [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.100
But if you think
about what this Ep is,

00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:37.710
this Ep has the M
still hiding in it.

00:39:37.710 --> 00:39:41.790
So this Ep is really the
physical on-shell energy,

00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.920
so it's mQ squared.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.340
If this was a heavy
hadron, for example,

00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:51.290
it'd be mH squared plus
the 3-momentum squared.

00:39:51.290 --> 00:39:54.650
And mH, for a heavy hadron,
has an mQ hiding in it.

00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:32.900
OK, so what we have to do if
we want to make everything

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.380
explicit is use HQET states.

00:40:36.380 --> 00:40:39.050
And you can think of HQET
states simply as the states

00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:42.830
that you get if you
define your quantum field

00:40:42.830 --> 00:40:45.020
theory using L HQET.

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:52.950
So this is the mQ
goes to infinity,

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:54.450
so it's just the
leading-order term.

00:41:05.130 --> 00:41:08.210
And if you define your
states with this Lagrangian,

00:41:08.210 --> 00:41:11.540
you can still talk about a
bound state like the B meson.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.050
Because the B quark
didn't go away.

00:41:13.050 --> 00:41:14.690
It just became static.

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:16.970
And all the dynamics of the
light degrees of freedom

00:41:16.970 --> 00:41:19.100
that are making it into
a hadron are still there,

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.830
and they're described by
a usual QCD Lagrangian.

00:41:21.830 --> 00:41:24.380
So you still have hadrons,
so you still have a B meson,

00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.010
but it's not the same because
you don't have any mQ's.

00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:29.180
They're all gone.

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:33.440
So you can't possibly have this
formula for the HQET definition

00:41:33.440 --> 00:41:35.622
of the state.

00:41:35.622 --> 00:41:37.580
And so the way that you
should think about this

00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:42.680
is that the relativistic
version of the state

00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:46.520
is related to the
HQET definition

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.780
by a formula like this.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:58.000
So the HQET
definition is this Hv,

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.580
the relativistic is this Hp.

00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:04.310
And there's some normalization
factor between them,

00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:08.560
and as well as there can be
1 over M type corrections.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.640
Actually, both things are there.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:18.580
And if we talk about
this H v field,

00:42:18.580 --> 00:42:24.610
where v is some external
label telling us the velocity

00:42:24.610 --> 00:42:28.180
and k is describing
some residual momentum

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:32.440
of that state, the
normalization convention

00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.980
would be as follows for HQET.

00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:45.500
So I've still left it to be 2.

00:42:45.500 --> 00:42:49.320
Sometimes people to
remove this 2, as well.

00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.300
So there's several
things going on here.

00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:53.300
One is that v and v prime--

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.190
in order for these
states to have overlap,

00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:57.930
we're saying that you should be
talking about hadrons that are

00:42:57.930 --> 00:42:59.180
moving with the same velocity.

00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.610
Remember velocity is
conserved, so if we

00:43:01.610 --> 00:43:03.110
had two things in
different sectors,

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:04.490
they just wouldn't overlap.

00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:06.350
That's [INAUDIBLE] of delta.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:09.020
This delta 3 of k
minus prime is exactly

00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:10.437
the analog of this
guy over here,

00:43:10.437 --> 00:43:12.395
but now it's with the k,
which is the residual.

00:43:12.395 --> 00:43:14.330
It has no mQ's.

00:43:14.330 --> 00:43:15.890
And I got rid of the mQ--

00:43:15.890 --> 00:43:18.980
I got rid of the thing
in the numerator that

00:43:18.980 --> 00:43:20.720
was pulling out this root mH.

00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.428
So there's no mQ's
in that formula,

00:43:22.428 --> 00:43:23.970
and that's the right
way of thinking.

00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:26.300
So you have to
remember, if you have

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.800
some formula for
the cross-section

00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:29.800
that you derived with
relativistic states, which

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.382
all of the formulas you're
used to are derived that way,

00:43:32.382 --> 00:43:34.090
you have to remember
about that root of H

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:39.105
when you're going to make
predictions with HQET.

00:43:39.105 --> 00:43:41.230
And the same thing actually
is true of the spinors.

00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:44.480
There's a square root of the
quark mass hiding in spinors,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.460
and you have to take
care of that, as well.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:48.590
I'll leave that
for your reading.

00:43:48.590 --> 00:43:49.090
OK?

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:52.807
So up to these little
subtleties here, that's

00:43:52.807 --> 00:43:54.640
all the mQ's that you
have to keep track of,

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:56.682
and once we've kept track
of all those mQ's, then

00:43:56.682 --> 00:44:00.998
we know how to do the power
counting in this theory.

00:44:00.998 --> 00:44:02.290
What can we do with the theory?

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:09.100
Well, one thing that
we can do immediately

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.840
is do some spectroscopy.

00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:19.927
So this will actually show us
partly what kind of predictions

00:44:19.927 --> 00:44:21.010
we can make from symmetry.

00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:27.610
So there's light
quarks and gluons,

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:30.370
and they are still
described, as I said in words

00:44:30.370 --> 00:44:35.770
but now I write on the
board, by a full L QCD.

00:44:35.770 --> 00:44:36.580
Nothing changes.

00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:39.520
There was no heavy quark
masses in that anyway,

00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:43.558
so nothing happens to that,
at least for what we're

00:44:43.558 --> 00:44:44.350
talking about here.

00:44:44.350 --> 00:44:46.142
There could be some
loop corrections, but--

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.460
So if we think about
mQ going to infinity,

00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:52.800
we can ask what happens
to these hadrons, which

00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.740
I've just told you you can
still describe by the theory.

00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:05.550
So if you think about a Q and a
light quark, which is a meson,

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:09.960
it has the quantum numbers
of the heavy quark.

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:12.270
And remember that the
number of heavy quarks

00:45:12.270 --> 00:45:15.552
is conserved in this limit.

00:45:15.552 --> 00:45:17.010
And then it has
the quantum numbers

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:20.550
of the rest of the stuff,
which could be an antiquark.

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.890
It could be any number
of Q q bar pairs

00:45:22.890 --> 00:45:25.080
because we don't know
how many are there.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.055
We have nonperturbative
interactions.

00:45:27.055 --> 00:45:28.680
And it could have
any number of gluons.

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:36.090
And generically, we call this
stuff light degrees of freedom

00:45:36.090 --> 00:45:38.580
because that's what it is.

00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:39.340
This is heavy.

00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.320
This is light.

00:45:40.320 --> 00:45:43.780
And it's just a
bunch of light stuff.

00:45:43.780 --> 00:45:44.280
OK?

00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.210
So that's kind of how we
can think of the state.

00:45:48.210 --> 00:45:49.950
It's a bunch of-- it's
an infinite number

00:45:49.950 --> 00:45:54.510
of single particle states
because it's a complicated QCD

00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:56.555
bound state.

00:45:56.555 --> 00:45:57.930
And what we want
to do is we want

00:45:57.930 --> 00:46:01.350
to sort of enumerate what
symmetry can tell us.

00:46:01.350 --> 00:46:04.530
Well, since we have the--

00:46:04.530 --> 00:46:06.360
we can think about
total angular momentum,

00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:08.530
and that is actually
a good quantum number.

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:11.980
It was in QCD, and it
remains true in HQET.

00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:16.398
The thing that's new is that the
heavy quark spin is conserved.

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:24.990
So SQ is conserved.

00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:26.610
And that we can use
to say something

00:46:26.610 --> 00:46:28.260
more about the states.

00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:50.120
And usually the way
that this is done

00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:57.020
is by defining Sl
to be J minus SQ.

00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:59.250
So if both J and SQ are
good things to talk about,

00:46:59.250 --> 00:47:02.880
we can also talk about Sl,
which is the difference.

00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.460
And if you want to think
of quantum numbers here,

00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.940
then J squared, right, would be,
in terms of quantum numbers, so

00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.920
J, J plus 1.

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:15.830
And so we can do the same
thing with Sl [INAUDIBLE] Sl,

00:47:15.830 --> 00:47:18.980
Sl plus 1.

00:47:18.980 --> 00:47:22.800
On a state with good
quantum numbers of Sl.

00:47:22.800 --> 00:47:29.300
So if we organize
things in terms of Sl,

00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:34.490
then we get symmetry
doublets for the mesons.

00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:44.330
So let's pick an Sl and some
parity, make a little table.

00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:50.940
If we take a 1/2 minus,
there's two mesons

00:47:50.940 --> 00:48:00.470
that fall in that camp, a B
and a B star that have little--

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:04.800
just call it capital J.
Let me call it little j.

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:12.080
j is 0 and 1 for these guys.

00:48:12.080 --> 00:48:16.470
So this is the scalar guy,
and this is a vector guy.

00:48:16.470 --> 00:48:19.078
And the parity is negative,
so it's a pseudoscalar.

00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:24.444
We can keep enumerating.

00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.270
There's a guy with
opposite party.

00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.940
These guys turned
out to be heavier.

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:41.720
This is the lightest
ground-state heavy mesons.

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:46.710
3/2 plus called B1 and B2 star.

00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.210
All these things
have been observed.

00:48:52.855 --> 00:48:54.480
And you could keep
going, and you could

00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:57.030
do the same thing for baryons.

00:48:57.030 --> 00:48:58.830
So if you do baryons,
then the spin

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:00.455
of the light degrees
of freedom are not

00:49:00.455 --> 00:49:03.150
half-integer, but integer.

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:07.657
0 plus is just the lambda B,
and then the only possible j

00:49:07.657 --> 00:49:10.410
is to add 1/2 for the SQ.

00:49:10.410 --> 00:49:12.360
So what's happening
is this is Sl,

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:15.750
and then remember that the
Lagrangian and the dynamics

00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:17.520
is independent of SQ.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:21.780
So I can add and subtract
the SQ from this Sl,

00:49:21.780 --> 00:49:25.950
and I get total j of 0 or 1,
but the dynamics of these mesons

00:49:25.950 --> 00:49:27.630
doesn't care about
the heavy quark spin,

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:30.840
so that's why they come
in a symmetry doublet.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.180
So the heavy quark spin
symmetry is relating things

00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:35.432
in a doublet of given Sl.

00:49:35.432 --> 00:49:36.390
That's how you should--

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:41.550
AUDIENCE: Notion to star just
always mean excited [INAUDIBLE]

00:49:41.550 --> 00:49:42.050
state?

00:49:44.940 --> 00:49:46.560
PROFESSOR: Star
is just another--

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.200
star is just something you can
put on the B to make it not

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:52.740
look like a B. [CHUCKLE]
You could put a twiddle--

00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:56.190
I mean, generically, it started
out as star being the vector.

00:49:56.190 --> 00:49:58.110
Star is like kind of a
notation for vectors.

00:49:58.110 --> 00:50:00.600
But then, of course, here
B0 star is a scalar, so--

00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:01.100
[CHUCKLES]

00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:01.653
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:50:01.653 --> 00:50:02.320
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:10.460
So we have the lambda B, and
then here we have sigmas.

00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:18.620
That's telling us that we're
already making some predictions

00:50:18.620 --> 00:50:21.380
about mesons, and
baryons, for that matter,

00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:23.520
just from symmetry.

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.450
Now, if you want to
really make predictions,

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:29.480
you'd like to look at
a little more dynamics,

00:50:29.480 --> 00:50:31.220
and for that there's
something that's

00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:35.630
kind of cool called using
a covariant representation

00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:38.460
of fields.

00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:42.110
So I want to show
you how that works.

00:50:42.110 --> 00:50:44.360
So we're going to see how
to make heavy quark symmetry

00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.270
predictions by building
up some object that has

00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:49.190
good transformation properties.

00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:52.070
And this is in general something
that's a more general lesson.

00:50:52.070 --> 00:50:53.570
If you have a
symmetry, and you want

00:50:53.570 --> 00:50:55.208
to make some predictions
that are just

00:50:55.208 --> 00:50:56.750
based on that
symmetry, then you want

00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:58.250
to think about how
things transform,

00:50:58.250 --> 00:51:01.160
and you can do tricks like the
ones I'm going to show you.

00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:05.300
So we're going to
encode heavy quark

00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:10.475
symmetry in objects with nice
transformation properties.

00:51:32.725 --> 00:51:35.350
The moral of this story is that
it's much easier to take traces

00:51:35.350 --> 00:51:38.647
than to think about
Clebsch-Gordan coefficients.

00:51:47.096 --> 00:51:48.600
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:51.000
PROFESSOR: Sure.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.360
AUDIENCE: The way you've
done it so far, when

00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.880
you throw in this v,
should I be worried

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:59.300
that you've broken [INAUDIBLE]?

00:51:59.300 --> 00:52:00.870
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:02.207
Angular momentum is conserved.

00:52:02.207 --> 00:52:03.540
It's the boosts that are broken.

00:52:03.540 --> 00:52:04.957
But we'll talk
about-- we're going

00:52:04.957 --> 00:52:06.160
to come to that in a minute.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:07.470
Yeah, yeah.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:08.550
But the ang--

00:52:08.550 --> 00:52:11.130
I mean, good question
related to this discussion.

00:52:11.130 --> 00:52:12.950
The angular momentum
is actually conserved.

00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:13.450
Yeah.

00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:19.480
OK.

00:52:23.410 --> 00:52:28.437
But rather than try to make
this a kind of derivation,

00:52:28.437 --> 00:52:30.020
I'm going to just
tell you the answer,

00:52:30.020 --> 00:52:32.966
and then we'll talk
about its properties.

00:52:32.966 --> 00:52:34.910
So I'm going to write
down a field that

00:52:34.910 --> 00:52:39.995
annihilates the meson doublet
for the ground-state mesons.

00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:45.320
Q is the heavy quark flavor.

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:57.800
pv mu star Q is something
that annihilates

00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:00.722
a vector, B star-type meson.

00:53:00.722 --> 00:53:05.390
So Q could be charm, as well.

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:10.370
And pv without the mu is
annihilating the B meson

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:17.290
if Q was B. This is
the flavor, which

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:21.645
you can think of as for this
discussion bottom or charm.

00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:25.880
And so this guy is a bispinor.

00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:33.280
It's got the indices
of Q q bar, but it's

00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.630
turned a vector field
and a pseudoscalar field

00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:40.240
into a bispinor.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.490
This thing here, this
1 plus v slash over 2,

00:53:42.490 --> 00:53:46.440
is projecting out the heavy
quark degrees of freedom.

00:53:50.250 --> 00:53:52.240
This is a vector.

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.110
So this is like something
that, if you acted on a state,

00:53:55.110 --> 00:53:57.920
would get replaced
by the polarization.

00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:02.820
Epsilon squared is minus
1, and v dot epsilon is 0,

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.115
so that means that v
dot this guy is also 0.

00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.300
And this is pseudoscalar.

00:54:10.300 --> 00:54:13.230
So this is the vector meson.

00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:14.460
This is the pseudoscalar.

00:54:23.810 --> 00:54:26.620
So what are the transformation
properties of this?

00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:27.760
So it's a bispinor.

00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:33.850
If you do a Lorentz,
it transforms

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:36.749
like a bispinor should under
a Lorentz transformation.

00:54:53.715 --> 00:54:55.680
This is a spinor
Lorentz transformation,

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:58.440
and v prime is the
transformation of v,

00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:02.550
and x prime is the
transformation of x.

00:55:02.550 --> 00:55:04.270
So that's how we
want it to transform.

00:55:04.270 --> 00:55:05.790
We want something that has--

00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:07.360
it's transforming
like this Q q bar.

00:55:11.370 --> 00:55:16.950
We've got v slash
on Hv equals Hv.

00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:19.750
That's one way of writing
this 1 plus v slash over 2Hv

00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:21.420
is equal to Hv.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:27.790
And that says that there's
no antiquark, so that's good.

00:55:27.790 --> 00:55:31.890
We can also, just by studying
the properties of this thing,

00:55:31.890 --> 00:55:39.757
work out that Hv B slash
is actually minus Hv.

00:55:39.757 --> 00:55:41.340
That one is not
something we built in.

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:42.090
That's an outcome.

00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:50.200
So you could work this out,
so I won't go through it.

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:53.400
You just push it
through the other side,

00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:56.260
and you can figure
out that that's true.

00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:59.190
So we'll use it, but
it's not something

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:01.860
that directly-- it's an outcome
of putting things together,

00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:05.070
not so much something
that we built in.

00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:12.050
If we talk about heavy quark
and light quark symmetries,

00:56:12.050 --> 00:56:23.657
so SQ cross Sl, then
it's 1/2, 1/2 under that.

00:56:23.657 --> 00:56:25.990
So if we work in the rest
frame, which is this vr, which

00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:32.570
is 1, 0, then you have--

00:56:32.570 --> 00:56:35.750
if you think about doing
a symmetry transformation,

00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:38.140
you get a commutator,
and basically

00:56:38.140 --> 00:56:42.340
what happens is
that you would get--

00:56:42.340 --> 00:56:45.260
you have two sets of--
you have a bispinor,

00:56:45.260 --> 00:56:47.350
so you have two parts
of the spinor that

00:56:47.350 --> 00:56:49.180
are corresponding to the
heavy quark and two parts that

00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.722
are corresponding
to the light quark.

00:56:50.722 --> 00:56:56.830
The heavy quark
part is on the left,

00:56:56.830 --> 00:57:01.120
and then the light quark
part is on the right.

00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:15.170
That's the spin transformations.

00:57:15.170 --> 00:57:17.720
And this is the right spin
transformation for something

00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:21.605
that's spin 1/2,
where the sigma 4 by 4

00:57:21.605 --> 00:57:22.985
is the usual spin matrix.

00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:40.280
Let me just say a bit more
about heavy quark spin

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:48.130
symmetry, which is part
of our discussion there.

00:57:48.130 --> 00:57:49.870
So Hv is transforming.

00:57:49.870 --> 00:57:53.210
If you do a heavy quark spin
symmetry transformation,

00:57:53.210 --> 00:57:54.460
it's transforming on the left.

00:57:54.460 --> 00:57:58.510
That's what I just
was discussing.

00:57:58.510 --> 00:58:02.110
And if you do some
transformation parameterized

00:58:02.110 --> 00:58:06.100
by some theta, which I just
dot into the S over there,

00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:09.340
then this is the way
we think about what

00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:11.620
the transformation gives.

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:15.730
So you could take this, and
you could plug in our Hv field

00:58:15.730 --> 00:58:18.610
and then just do
the Dirac algebra

00:58:18.610 --> 00:58:22.450
with the gamma and the gamma
5 and simplify this thing down

00:58:22.450 --> 00:58:31.195
and work out a transformation
for delta pv and delta pv star.

00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:43.050
And what you'd find is that this
guy in the rest frame here--

00:58:43.050 --> 00:58:53.290
everything in the rest frame is
that, and this guy, theta cross

00:58:53.290 --> 00:59:01.423
pvr star minus 1/2 theta pvr.

00:59:01.423 --> 00:59:03.090
So if you talk about
the transformations

00:59:03.090 --> 00:59:06.330
under heavy quark spin
symmetry of the states,

00:59:06.330 --> 00:59:09.007
these are actually getting
mixed up into each other.

00:59:09.007 --> 00:59:10.590
And that's what we
already were saying

00:59:10.590 --> 00:59:12.548
before when we were
talking about spectroscopy,

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:14.850
that spin symmetry
was relating the two.

00:59:14.850 --> 00:59:17.760
This is us now seeing
that very explicitly,

00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:20.270
that if you make a heavy quark
spin symmetry transformation,

00:59:20.270 --> 00:59:22.410
the vector guy--

00:59:22.410 --> 00:59:25.290
so this guy should have a star--

00:59:25.290 --> 00:59:28.740
and the scalar guy get mixed up.

00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:30.960
And that's what spin
symmetry allows you to do,

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:33.660
is relate any
statements about the v

00:59:33.660 --> 00:59:35.340
to statements about the v star.

00:59:35.340 --> 00:59:37.950
It's one thing it
allows you to do.

00:59:37.950 --> 00:59:42.180
So the power of
this Hvr thing is

00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:47.940
that it allows us to make
heavy quark spin symmetry

00:59:47.940 --> 00:59:53.820
predictions easily
because we've encoded

00:59:53.820 --> 00:59:55.080
the symmetry in this object.

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.420
Kind of like our
spurion analysis,

00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:01.020
we'll be able to use
similar types of ideas

01:00:01.020 --> 01:00:04.747
to make spin symmetry
predictions easy with this guy.

01:00:04.747 --> 01:00:06.330
So let me give you
an example of that.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:16.050
So an example is talking about
heavy quark decay constants.

01:00:16.050 --> 01:00:18.430
And we can think about
B mesons or D mesons.

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:23.220
Correspondingly, B
stars and D stars.

01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:34.170
So think of the Q field here
that I'm writing as a full QCD

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:37.980
field, and the p field
here with momentum p,

01:00:37.980 --> 01:00:40.350
it's either a B
meson or a D meson.

01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:46.020
And just by Lorentz
symmetry, much like one

01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:48.570
works out for the pion,
one can write down

01:00:48.570 --> 01:00:53.443
a result that just falls from
Lorentz invariance and parity

01:00:53.443 --> 01:00:55.110
for what the result
for this coefficient

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.075
is, because you also have
to use time reversal.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:07.410
And you could also
write the p as mp times

01:01:07.410 --> 01:01:10.500
v if you want to make
explicit that there's

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.860
some velocity that this
thing, that this p squares

01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:17.080
to the mass of that state.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:20.860
So this guy here is some
dimension 1 constant.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:27.750
And if we just, in
QCD, do the same thing

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:34.320
for the other guy,
which is the vector,

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:36.720
we can do the same game.

01:01:36.720 --> 01:01:38.430
Here we have to
get a polarization

01:01:38.430 --> 01:01:39.818
on the right-hand side.

01:01:39.818 --> 01:01:41.610
There has to be linear
in the polarization.

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:43.830
That's the statement
about a vector.

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:46.980
And because of parity, it's
not the gamma mu, gamma phi,

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:49.590
but the gamma mu that
comes in because we

01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:52.330
have spin 1 instead of spin 0.

01:01:52.330 --> 01:01:54.160
So there's an extra
minus 1 from that.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:56.070
So instead of-- so we
have a gamma mu here,

01:01:56.070 --> 01:01:58.110
and this is how we can
parameterize the matrix

01:01:58.110 --> 01:01:58.950
element.

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:01.290
And this guy here, if we
work out the dimensions,

01:02:01.290 --> 01:02:03.090
it would be dimension 2.

01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:05.070
So just in QCD, it
looks like we have

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:08.400
these two things, fp and fp
star, that are different.

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.180
But we know heavy quark symmetry
relates the p and the p star,

01:02:12.180 --> 01:02:14.230
so they actually
should be related.

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:16.650
So you could ask the question,
how are they related?

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:18.032
Work it out.

01:02:18.032 --> 01:02:19.740
And if I asked you
that question, the way

01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:22.710
to work it out, which I'll show
you, is to use this Hv field.

01:02:25.890 --> 01:02:28.560
OK, so there's two things
we have to work out.

01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:31.420
We have to-- we're going
to use the Hv field.

01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:32.170
I'll show you how.

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:33.930
We also have to think
about these currents

01:02:33.930 --> 01:02:36.780
that I've talked about here and
writing them in terms of the Qv

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.090
field, so let's do that first.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.280
So that's pretty easy.

01:02:58.650 --> 01:03:01.200
Just replace our
field by the Qv field.

01:03:22.555 --> 01:03:24.930
Now, if I just want to make
a statement about heavy quark

01:03:24.930 --> 01:03:27.570
symmetry, then I can look
at how this guy transforms

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:29.070
under heavy quark
symmetry because I

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:31.350
know how Qv transforms
under heavy quark symmetry.

01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:46.800
So [INAUDIBLE] D.

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.200
And so what I'd like
to do is I'd like

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:52.410
to encode in a general object--

01:03:55.925 --> 01:03:57.800
much as we did in chiral
perturbation theory,

01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:03.860
I'd like to encode in a general
object that involves the Hv

01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:07.940
field something that has
the same transformation

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.280
properties as this current.

01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.540
Much in the same way we
could think about putting--

01:04:28.540 --> 01:04:30.760
connecting currents that
transformed in a certain way

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.260
to a chiral theory, we're
doing the same thing

01:04:32.260 --> 01:04:33.070
with heavy quarks.

01:04:36.570 --> 01:04:40.710
So let's pretend--
in order to do this,

01:04:40.710 --> 01:04:43.110
instead of thinking
about covariance,

01:04:43.110 --> 01:04:44.610
we'd want to think
about invariance.

01:04:44.610 --> 01:04:49.530
So pretend that the Dirac
structure transforms such

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:52.120
that we cancel that D.
Then we have an invariant,

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:55.530
and we can think about building
invariance out of the Hv field.

01:04:58.290 --> 01:05:00.900
And it's very simple because
if we think about that,

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:04.060
gamma times Hv is invariant.

01:05:09.450 --> 01:05:12.900
You only have to think
about one Hv field

01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:16.059
because the number of
heavy quarks is preserved.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.950
OK?

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:23.800
So we know there's only one,
and then the other thing that

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:25.308
transforms is to gamma.

01:05:25.308 --> 01:05:27.100
And so that we can form
an invariant, which

01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:37.350
is gamma H. So then if
you look at this thing--

01:05:40.810 --> 01:05:44.220
and then the sandwiching
with this guy--

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:49.770
the indices of--

01:05:49.770 --> 01:05:51.270
So this guy's got
a vector index,

01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:52.687
and this guy's got
a scalar index,

01:05:52.687 --> 01:05:56.280
but that's all encoded
in our Hv field, right?

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.810
It's got indices
for those fields.

01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:00.972
So we're basically
constructing things--

01:06:00.972 --> 01:06:02.430
we're just basically
constructing--

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.748
if we've already
accounted for the indices

01:06:04.748 --> 01:06:06.540
here on the left-hand
side of the equation,

01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:09.960
then we're just constructing
things that are scalars.

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:18.450
So Lorentz covariance
requires us

01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:25.750
to take a trace to get a scalar,
and so we basically have trace.

01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:28.190
We can put anything
we like here.

01:06:28.190 --> 01:06:33.910
And then we have gamma Hv, which
is like the QCD stuff, and then

01:06:33.910 --> 01:06:36.613
the heavy quark part.

01:06:36.613 --> 01:06:38.530
So we just have to write
down the most general

01:06:38.530 --> 01:06:39.850
x that we can think of.

01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:47.260
And there's not
that much we can do

01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.690
because there's not that
many vectors available to us.

01:06:50.690 --> 01:06:52.360
So there's two things
that we can do.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:55.455
We can write down something
that just is a diagonal

01:06:55.455 --> 01:06:56.705
or something that's a v slash.

01:06:59.470 --> 01:07:01.300
But then we can
simplify this guy

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:06.020
because Hv v slash is minus Hv.

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:08.000
See, I can take this,
and this is a trace,

01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.790
so I can move it over to
the other side of the trace,

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:11.998
and if it's a v slash on
the other side of the trace,

01:07:11.998 --> 01:07:13.850
then I can use this formula.

01:07:13.850 --> 01:07:17.380
And so these two guys
here actually just become,

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:21.700
after taking that into account,
one thing, which I'll just call

01:07:21.700 --> 01:07:23.390
a.

01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:24.850
So there's basically
a unique thing

01:07:24.850 --> 01:07:26.230
that we can write
down for the x.

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:29.680
After we use all the symmetry
properties of the Hv,

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:31.970
we only have one thing.

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:34.930
And so then you can just
work out what that trace is.

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:40.480
Just take the trace.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:46.990
And you get a, and you
get minus i v mu pv,

01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:52.930
or you get pv star mu,
and this is what you get

01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:55.163
if you have gamma mu, gamma 5.

01:07:55.163 --> 01:07:57.080
And this is what you get
if you have gamma mu,

01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:58.960
and if you have the other way--

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.210
so for gamma mu, you don't
get any pseudoscalar,

01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:03.430
and for gamma mu gamma 5,
you don't get any vector.

01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:14.190
So the way that you
should think about this

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:22.855
is that in the matrix element
and only in the matrix element,

01:08:22.855 --> 01:08:25.140
but between these
ground-state mesons,

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:32.310
I can really think that I've
made some connection that

01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:33.540
looks like as follows.

01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:38.279
That Q gamma H v--

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:51.830
sorry, Qv is a over 2 times
this trace of gamma Hv

01:08:51.830 --> 01:08:54.680
if I'm in the matrix element.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:56.840
And then I know how to
take matrix elements

01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.215
with these fields
because they're

01:08:58.215 --> 01:09:00.840
the fields that actually are
annihilating those states.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:06.890
So then Q bar gamma
mu, gamma 5, capital

01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:14.330
Q. Now I'm using HQET states.

01:09:14.330 --> 01:09:17.537
They're actually
annihilating HQET states.

01:09:17.537 --> 01:09:19.870
And I just use the formula
that I've derived over there.

01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:36.050
And I get these two results.

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:39.705
So for HQET states, I
have only one constant, a.

01:09:39.705 --> 01:09:41.330
And that's because
heavy quark symmetry

01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:42.680
related the decay constants.

01:09:46.752 --> 01:09:48.210
And if I look at
all the dimensions

01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:51.149
of the things on this
side and count them up,

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:52.607
I find that the
dimensions here are

01:09:52.607 --> 01:09:53.982
such that this
would be something

01:09:53.982 --> 01:09:55.230
that's lambda QCD to the 3/2.

01:10:02.170 --> 01:10:06.100
So then I can try to go back and
connect to my decay constants

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.050
what this a is.

01:10:08.050 --> 01:10:10.120
And we know how to do
that because I told you

01:10:10.120 --> 01:10:12.830
how to connect
the states, and we

01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:16.060
talked about how to connect the
currents, which is very simple.

01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:18.640
These states here are
dimension minus 3/2,

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:20.890
and that's basically what
leads to the different power

01:10:20.890 --> 01:10:23.510
on the right-hand side.

01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:25.900
So connect the states.

01:10:25.900 --> 01:10:29.620
That gives some extra
factors of meson masses,

01:10:29.620 --> 01:10:33.250
and we find that fp is
this universal constant,

01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:40.360
a over square root
mp, and fp star is

01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:44.080
this a times the
square root of mp star,

01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.270
and then we're getting
correctly the dimension 2

01:10:46.270 --> 01:10:54.850
or the dimension 1 quantities
in terms of one universal a, OK?

01:10:54.850 --> 01:10:56.440
So you can make
predictions from this.

01:10:56.440 --> 01:11:00.677
So for example, you could take
fB, and you could say, well,

01:11:00.677 --> 01:11:01.640
how big should fB be?

01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.580
Well, it should be, by
dimensional analysis,

01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:07.960
now that we've figured out how
to do dimensional analysis,

01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.220
it should be of this size.

01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:13.990
And that gives you something
that's not too far off.

01:11:13.990 --> 01:11:19.390
Or you could take fB over
fD, and you could predict--

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:21.640
because actually we
don't care whether it's

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:24.085
a charm quark or a B quark.

01:11:24.085 --> 01:11:26.710
The a here didn't care about the
flavor of the p and the p star

01:11:26.710 --> 01:11:27.080
state.

01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:29.163
So everything I said here
could apply equally well

01:11:29.163 --> 01:11:31.340
to B states or D states.

01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.140
So if we make--

01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:33.970
so the only place
that it's coming in

01:11:33.970 --> 01:11:37.450
is when we have this
explicit square root here.

01:11:37.450 --> 01:11:41.170
And just by power counting,
we should say fB over fD

01:11:41.170 --> 01:11:48.120
is like mD over mB,
which is about 0.6.

01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:48.620
OK?

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.290
So these are predictions that
we can make based on symmetry.

01:11:51.290 --> 01:11:53.655
And then if you have a
prediction based on symmetry,

01:11:53.655 --> 01:11:56.030
you could also talk about
symmetry-violating corrections,

01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:59.420
and people do that
kind of thing to make--

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:01.010
a is the lowest
prediction, but you

01:12:01.010 --> 01:12:04.070
could talk about violating it
with some higher-order a's, and

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:07.580
those type of things are done.

01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:10.170
The real place that this
gives a lot of power,

01:12:10.170 --> 01:12:12.650
I have to mention,
although we'll not

01:12:12.650 --> 01:12:14.510
talk about it in
detail, is when you

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:17.373
look at semileptonic decays.

01:12:17.373 --> 01:12:19.040
So if you look at the
semileptonic decay

01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:22.160
of a transition of
a B meson into a D,

01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.240
or a B meson into
a D star, then you

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:28.250
can again use all
these symmetry tricks

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:30.620
and again use this H v field--

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.990
and some of the
reading will talk

01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:35.665
about this, these weak decays.

01:12:35.665 --> 01:12:37.790
If you were to enumerate
the number of form factors

01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:40.040
you'd have in QCD, you'd
have six form factors.

01:12:45.380 --> 01:12:48.350
And once you go over to
the heavy quark limit,

01:12:48.350 --> 01:12:49.070
there's just one.

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.520
And it's actually
normalized, too,

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:05.460
because it's related
to a conserved charge.

01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:07.200
[INAUDIBLE] spin
symmetry to relate it.

01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.033
You could use your heavy
quark spin symmetry

01:13:09.033 --> 01:13:10.740
to actually relate it to the--

01:13:10.740 --> 01:13:13.530
the operator that counts
the number of B quarks.

01:13:13.530 --> 01:13:15.600
So these form factors,
you don't know anything

01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.230
about their normalization.

01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:18.330
There's six of them.

01:13:18.330 --> 01:13:21.220
Take this limit, you get
one, and it's normalized.

01:13:21.220 --> 01:13:22.270
It's kind of nice.

01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:23.770
It's called the
Isgur-Wise function.

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.430
AUDIENCE: I have
a quick question.

01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:28.097
PROFESSOR: Yeah?

01:13:28.097 --> 01:13:31.530
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] you
said that that [INAUDIBLE]..

01:13:31.530 --> 01:13:33.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:13:33.590 --> 01:13:35.330
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:35.330 --> 01:13:36.580
PROFESSOR: Why did I say that?

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.250
So for example,
imagine that I was

01:13:39.250 --> 01:13:42.310
to have done this for
not the p and the p star,

01:13:42.310 --> 01:13:45.190
but for these other
things that I was calling

01:13:45.190 --> 01:13:49.090
B0 and B1, or B1 and B2.

01:13:49.090 --> 01:13:50.710
Then when I would
go through it, I

01:13:50.710 --> 01:13:52.637
would have not
used the Hv field.

01:13:52.637 --> 01:13:54.220
I would have had to
build a field that

01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:57.580
has those guys in it, which
would have spin 1 and spin 2.

01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:59.560
And that would be a
different matrix element.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:01.910
I can still do the
whole same story,

01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:04.540
but really, this formula,
this particular version

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:07.540
of the current, is only
true for these states,

01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.127
and for other states you'd have
to use a different version.

01:14:10.127 --> 01:14:10.960
That's what I meant.

01:14:17.950 --> 01:14:19.407
Any other questions?

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:29.890
OK, so I want to just, in
remaining two minutes, get

01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:33.380
started on something else
that I'd like to talk about,

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:37.780
which is related to the
question that we left aside,

01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.736
and that is, what about
alpha s corrections?

01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:48.510
And there's a couple of things
here that are interesting.

01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:51.450
But basically, it
boils down to--

01:14:51.450 --> 01:14:54.720
We've already seen how to do
matching and normalization

01:14:54.720 --> 01:15:00.870
group evolution, but now
we have these extra labels,

01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:06.450
and so we can ask, what
impact does having labels

01:15:06.450 --> 01:15:09.060
on that whole story of matching
and normalization group

01:15:09.060 --> 01:15:10.560
evolution, what
impact does it have?

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:12.060
And we'll say that
there are examples

01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:13.268
where it does have an impact.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.040
So--

01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:24.900
HQET radiative corrections.

01:15:27.570 --> 01:15:29.490
So if you like,
we're just thinking

01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:31.710
about the renormalization,
as we should

01:15:31.710 --> 01:15:34.290
for any effective theory,
think about what's

01:15:34.290 --> 01:15:37.050
the renormalization structure.

01:15:37.050 --> 01:15:40.450
And since it's a top-down, we
can also think about matching.

01:15:42.913 --> 01:15:44.580
So we should think
about renormalization

01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:46.987
of L. We should think
about renormalization

01:15:46.987 --> 01:15:48.570
of external currents,
like the ones we

01:15:48.570 --> 01:15:50.800
were talking about over there.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:57.110
And if we match a
full theory current,

01:15:57.110 --> 01:15:58.860
the way that you should
think about what's

01:15:58.860 --> 01:16:00.527
happening from matching
is that there'll

01:16:00.527 --> 01:16:05.970
be some Wilson coefficient
that's generated

01:16:05.970 --> 01:16:09.600
by radiative corrections.

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:13.320
So once we think about
adding alpha s corrections

01:16:13.320 --> 01:16:16.620
to our story, there
could be radiative

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:19.170
corrections and Lagrangians--
we'll talk about that.

01:16:19.170 --> 01:16:22.890
But there also are nontrivial
radiative corrections here

01:16:22.890 --> 01:16:26.310
in the currents, where they get
multiplied by something that

01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:29.183
depends on virtual
interactions having

01:16:29.183 --> 01:16:31.350
to do with antiparticles
that we're integrating out,

01:16:31.350 --> 01:16:33.300
and that just affects
these currents,

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.160
the current relations,
by multiplying them

01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.695
by some coefficients.

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:49.220
Yeah.

01:16:54.290 --> 01:16:56.150
So the first thing
that actually differs,

01:16:56.150 --> 01:16:59.210
and it's because, again,
there's no antiparticles--

01:16:59.210 --> 01:17:01.490
that changes the nature
of loop diagrams--

01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:04.280
is the wavefunction
normalization.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.880
So we have to go
through that again.

01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.080
So if we do field
renormalization,

01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.345
it's the same kind of
story as it is in QCD.

01:17:14.345 --> 01:17:15.720
We have to consider
this diagram,

01:17:15.720 --> 01:17:19.190
but we have to calculate
it now in HQET.

01:17:19.190 --> 01:17:21.620
So let there be some external--

01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:23.150
I'll call it p.

01:17:23.150 --> 01:17:25.455
I should call it k.

01:17:25.455 --> 01:17:26.290
Call it k.

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.640
There'll be some loop
momentum, and we have q plus k.

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:48.120
If we use dimensional
regularization,

01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:51.100
then this loop integral
looks like this.

01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:55.590
So using [? m ?] [? s ?] bar,
there's some usual [? m ?]

01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:57.790
[? s bar-type ?] factors.

01:17:57.790 --> 01:18:00.690
And then there's the
relativistic propagator,

01:18:00.690 --> 01:18:03.990
which I'm using Feynman
gauge, so it's just q squared,

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:09.390
and then there's the heavy
quark propagator, which

01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:10.718
would look like that.

01:18:10.718 --> 01:18:12.510
So the loop integral
that I have to do here

01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:14.700
wouldn't have two
relativistic propagators.

01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.380
It has one heavy
quark propagator

01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:18.570
and one relativistic
propagator, and it

01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:20.910
will give something
different, and we'll

01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:24.960
talk about it in more detail
next time, about evaluating

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.120
this loop integral.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.283
So I wanted to do one
loop integral for you.

01:18:28.283 --> 01:18:30.450
And basically the way I'm
going to talk about these,

01:18:30.450 --> 01:18:31.867
the renormalizations
and matching,

01:18:31.867 --> 01:18:33.408
is I'll do this loop
integral for you

01:18:33.408 --> 01:18:35.910
so you have some idea what would
be involved if I was asking

01:18:35.910 --> 01:18:39.165
you to do them yourself, which
I don't think I'm going to do.

01:18:39.165 --> 01:18:41.040
And then I'll just be
quoting results for you

01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.130
and telling you kind of how the
structure of the theory looks

01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:47.280
and where the corrections
are going and talking

01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:49.980
about the important things
that come out of the results,

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:52.170
rather than dwelling on
calculational details.

01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:54.480
But we will talk
about one calculation

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:57.210
because there's one trick that
you should know if you ever

01:18:57.210 --> 01:18:59.430
encounter an integral
of this type,

01:18:59.430 --> 01:19:02.130
since it's different than
just using a Feynman parameter

01:19:02.130 --> 01:19:03.490
trick.

01:19:03.490 --> 01:19:05.608
And that difference comes
about because this guy

01:19:05.608 --> 01:19:06.900
is linear in the loop momentum.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:08.640
This guy's quadratic.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.690
You have to know how
to deal with that,

01:19:10.690 --> 01:19:13.250
so we'll talk about
that next time.

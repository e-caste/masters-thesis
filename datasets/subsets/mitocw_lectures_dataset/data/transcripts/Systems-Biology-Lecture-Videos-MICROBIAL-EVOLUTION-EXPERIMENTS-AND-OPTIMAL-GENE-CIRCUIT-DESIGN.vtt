00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.510
PROFESSOR: So today, our goal
is to really go through this

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.240
the paper that you
read maybe last night

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.130
by Dekel and Alon "Optimality
and Evolutionary Tuning

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.855
of the Expression
Level of a Protein."

00:00:32.855 --> 00:00:35.690
It was published
in Nature in 2005.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.140
I think that it's a very
interesting paper, exploring

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.060
some kind of big general ideas.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.960
I think it's also, in some
ways, rather misleading.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.970
And we'll try to
understand or discuss

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.630
the ways in which the
connections between experiment,

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.760
theory, prediction,
and so forth,

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.190
how they all play out in
the context of this problem.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.360
Before we get going too
much on the science,

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.310
I just want to remind
everyone that Andrew will not

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.790
be having office hours today.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.800
He is off interviewing for
MD, PhD programs right now.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.370
But if you had questions
about the problems,

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.770
I hope that you asked
[? Sarab ?] last night.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.640
You might be able to grab
him after the lecture

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.230
today, but yes.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.895
Any other questions about
anything before we get going?

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:33.830
No.

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.120
So I think that this
paper in general, I guess,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.460
the lecture today is
really a combination

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.750
of trying to start thinking
about maybe laboratory

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.480
evolution or kind of population
level phenomena in general,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.090
as well as this
question of optimization

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.630
in terms of protein expression.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.870
So can somebody
just maybe summarize

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.750
the big idea of this paper?

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.394
Yes, please.

00:02:12.394 --> 00:02:15.262
AUDIENCE: Protein
expression levels

00:02:15.262 --> 00:02:20.998
evolve to optimal values
for cost-benefit questions.

00:02:20.998 --> 00:02:23.920
PROFESSOR: Right, so that's
the argument at least.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.000
And they have a very
nice first sentence here.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.220
"Different proteins have
different expression levels."

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.540
You know, it's hard to
argue with that statement,

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.660
nice, concise.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.600
But the question is, well, why?

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:40.470
And I'd say that
there is a range,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.910
different philosophical
opinions out in the world.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.470
I said that some group
that is very much reflected

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.610
in this study is trying
to think about this

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.180
in the context of optimization.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.900
Well, maybe the reason that we
see a given level of expression

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.780
of some protein is because, at
least over evolutionary time,

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.600
in some ancestral environment
that we don't know, but maybe

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.671
it evolved to optimize
some cost-benefit problem.

00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:11.420
And then I'd say that
there's another kind

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.060
of general
philosophical approach

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.740
that tends to be a little
bit more agnostic or just

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:21.270
maybe more of a sense that
certainly things could have

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.020
evolved to optimize something.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.880
But we can never really
know where they evolved in,

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.730
so we shouldn't be going out
on a limb on these things.

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.150
And given that
this is philosophy,

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.839
I will maybe not
require that you agree

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.130
with any particular standpoint.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:38.420
But I will say that it's
at least worth thinking

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.070
about the question
and maybe you can

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.150
do measurements to illuminate
whether all these ideas might

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.390
make sense.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.560
And then we'll try to, over
the next hour and a half,

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.660
figure out to what degree this
paper maybe should convince us

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.740
of this optimization
in the context

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.640
of this particular protein.

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.360
Now, even if it's the
case that somebody

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.490
convinces you maybe that
expression of the lac operon

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.730
maybe does optimize some
cost-benefit analysis.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.760
That does not prove that
every protein optimize things.

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.310
So don't get overwhelmed
or underwhelmed

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.920
or whatever it might be.

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.500
Let's just first
make sure that we

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.960
understand what we mean by
costs and benefits in this case.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.330
Can somebody pick one of them?

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.860
Now, what is a cost and
benefit in the context

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.060
of maybe this paper?

00:04:46.272 --> 00:04:46.772
Yes.

00:04:46.772 --> 00:04:50.146
AUDIENCE: Producing protein
requires some kind of resource.

00:04:50.146 --> 00:04:52.295
PROFESSOR: Right, requires--

00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:54.550
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] energy--

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:59.297
PROFESSOR: --requires resources
of some sort or another

00:04:59.297 --> 00:05:00.380
to express these proteins.

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.780
And this can manifest
in many different ways.

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.342
But certainly, if you were
not making these proteins,

00:05:11.342 --> 00:05:13.300
you could have been making
some other proteins.

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.110
And so if these proteins
are not helping you, then

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.640
maybe something else would have.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.190
But they're are many different
ways of looking at this.

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:22.840
But there is some finite number
of things that the cell can do.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.250
And the benefits, of course,
in the case-- and this

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.700
is in particular in
the case of a lac

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:38.925
operon, what does this
network allow us to do?

00:05:38.925 --> 00:05:39.425
Yeah.

00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:42.400
AUDIENCE: You get to consume
the energy of lactose.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.076
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:05:43.076 --> 00:05:44.284
AUDIENCE: Lets you go faster.

00:05:44.284 --> 00:05:48.419
PROFESSOR: That's right,
you get to consume lactose

00:05:48.419 --> 00:05:48.960
in this case.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.190
Now, we've already spent some
time thinking or discussing

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.230
the lac operon.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:08.180
What were the two key components
in here in the lac operon?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.237
If you were a cell and
you wanted to eat lactose,

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.320
what would you need to do?

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.581
I'm picking somebody
to-- yes, please.

00:06:27.581 --> 00:06:31.189
AUDIENCE: It's a gene that you
should express, the lac gene?

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:32.090
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.030
So the lac genes.

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:35.816
But maybe in a little
bit more detail,

00:06:35.816 --> 00:06:37.565
what do we mean when
we say the lac genes?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.561
Well, I mean, it's
not just lactose.

00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:46.060
But I mean, what
are the things that

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.234
have to happen if you want
to eat anything, I guess?

00:06:49.234 --> 00:06:49.733
Your cell--

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:53.670
AUDIENCE: Import.

00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:57.700
PROFESSOR: Right, so you
first have to import it.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:01.970
Now, in some cases, this can
be done maybe for some-- maybe

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:03.900
nutrients, it could be
done even passively,

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.620
if it crosses the
membrane easily.

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.600
But for most of the things
that you might think about,

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:10.710
you actually have
to do active import.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.352
So this is done by what?

00:07:12.352 --> 00:07:13.060
Anybody remember?

00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:16.950
lacY.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:27.050
So lacY is a membrane
protein that imports lactose.

00:07:33.330 --> 00:07:35.751
And then what do you need to do?

00:07:35.751 --> 00:07:38.613
AUDIENCE: Break the two apart,
and then you can metabolize.

00:07:38.613 --> 00:07:43.120
PROFESSOR: Right, then you
have to eat it somehow.

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.300
Now, of course, metabolism
is a very complicated thing.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.930
But the key thing that's
different between lactose

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:52.450
and maybe the simple
sugars is that you first

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.760
have to break down the lactose
into its constituent parts.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.530
A lactose is a
disaccharide composed

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.340
of two simple monosaccharides.

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:05.210
So what you need is you need
this lacZ, beta-galactosidase,

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:07.670
in order to cleave that bond.

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.850
And then you have the two
simple monosaccharides

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:10.600
that can be eaten.

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.100
Now, the lac operon
also has this lacA.

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.200
And it's not quite obvious
what that thing does,

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.460
so nobody ever talks about it.

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.180
But there is a
third protein there.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:24.929
But what we always
talk about is lacY,

00:08:24.929 --> 00:08:27.220
that's require to import the
lactose and then lacZ that

00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.429
is required to break the lactose
down into its monosaccharides.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:35.440
And then the idea-- and
that's not sufficient.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:36.940
You don't take those
monosaccharides

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:39.390
and instantly make
more cells out of it.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.150
But the idea is that the rest
of the metabolic machinery

00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:46.210
is kind of there any
ways to do other-- that's

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:47.320
kind of some assumptions.

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:04.840
Can somebody explain how it
is that they measured the cost

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.450
of expressing these proteins?

00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:12.140
Yes.

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:19.535
AUDIENCE: So they [INAUDIBLE]
expressed these proteins

00:09:19.535 --> 00:09:22.493
at different levels using
different concentrations

00:09:22.493 --> 00:09:23.479
of IPTG.

00:09:23.479 --> 00:09:24.250
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.272
AUDIENCE: There was
no lactose around,

00:09:26.272 --> 00:09:28.062
so it was only the
cost to no benefits.

00:09:28.062 --> 00:09:29.520
And then they
measured [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:30.770
PROFESSOR: All right, perfect.

00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:32.760
OK, so there are several
key things in here.

00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:34.330
So first of all,
normally, what we do

00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:38.710
is it's lactose inside the
cell that causes this lac

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.550
repressor to fall
off and then you get

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:46.200
expression of the lac operon.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.010
But in order to kind of
sidestep or circumvent

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.760
that normal network, what
we are doing in this case

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.672
is adding IPTG.

00:09:54.672 --> 00:10:04.070
So IPTG allows one to
get expression of--

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:12.770
and what IPTG is that it stops
the inhibition of this lac

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:14.480
promoter, where you
get lacZ and lacY.

00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.120
Now, the idea here
is that you can

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:28.540
control the level of
expression of this operon,

00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.600
because what we
really want is we

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.840
want to measure a
plot of something

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:38.350
that you would call cost--
and we'll explore a little bit

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:42.341
more what that means-- as a
function of the lac operon

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:42.840
expression.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:52.500
And this is often done
relative to the full induction

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:54.490
of the wild type lac operon.

00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.370
And this is a relative
growth rate reduction.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:03.250
So basically, this
is a percentage,

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.180
say, decrease in growth rate.

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.790
Now, there was a key
thing that you brought up,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:15.160
which is that you want
to measure the growth

00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.430
rate in the absence of lactose.

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:20.650
Because otherwise as we
increase the level of expression

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:23.370
here-- so we're
controlling this by IPTG,

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:26.210
so there's some mapping
from IPTG concentration

00:11:26.210 --> 00:11:29.390
to the level of expression here.

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:32.630
But we want to be able
to measure the cost

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:35.430
separate from the benefits.

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:39.760
So it's important then to grow
this in the absence of lactose.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:41.140
So say, no lactose.

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.920
But if I just take
bacteria and I put them

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:52.760
in a tube with say
minimal media, salt,

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:57.834
so forth, but no lactose,
are they going to grow?

00:11:57.834 --> 00:11:59.000
They need to draw something.

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.802
So what is it that
the authors have done?

00:12:11.174 --> 00:12:11.674
Yes.

00:12:11.674 --> 00:12:12.658
AUDIENCE: Glycerol.

00:12:12.658 --> 00:12:16.300
PROFESSOR: That's right,
they added some glycerol

00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:18.270
and in different parts.

00:12:18.270 --> 00:12:20.100
I think it's 1% glycerol.

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.950
Does anybody happen to remember?

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:26.740
I think, for most
of it, it was 0.1%.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.510
I tell you what,
we'll say a little bit

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:30.940
of small concentrations
of glycerol.

00:12:35.215 --> 00:12:40.360
So the idea is that this is kind
of a second rate carbon source.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.630
The bacteria are not super
happy, but they're OK.

00:12:44.630 --> 00:12:49.605
And then given this,
what they were able

00:12:49.605 --> 00:12:51.480
demonstrate is that, if
they did add lactose,

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.100
they would have grown faster.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.832
So there's a sense that the
lactose does help the cells.

00:12:57.832 --> 00:12:59.290
But you have to
have some glycerol.

00:12:59.290 --> 00:13:03.069
Otherwise, you can't really
measure these things.

00:13:03.069 --> 00:13:03.569
Yeah.

00:13:03.569 --> 00:13:05.755
AUDIENCE: Why is it that-- you
were saying if you put like

00:13:05.755 --> 00:13:07.050
a very good carbon source--

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.460
PROFESSOR: Well--

00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:08.820
AUDIENCE: You're not going
to see any [INAUDIBLE].

00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.065
PROFESSOR: OK, so first
of all what I was saying

00:13:10.065 --> 00:13:11.590
is that you have to
have some carbon source.

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.270
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:16.030
PROFESSOR: Right, so you
have to do something.

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:17.820
And it's just good
conceptually to make

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.130
sure you think about
how you would actually

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:19.940
do this experiment.

00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:21.685
Now, you have to add
some carbon source.

00:13:21.685 --> 00:13:23.810
But the question is, well,
what happens if you just

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:24.960
added a bunch of glucose?

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.670
Now, in that case actually, for
some of the other experiments,

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:34.040
I think that would have
caused problems in the sense

00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:36.940
that then there would not
be any benefits associated

00:13:36.940 --> 00:13:43.040
with growing or with adding
increasing lac operon

00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:44.470
expression.

00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:45.940
For this experiment,
in principle,

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.529
one could have done
that, although you really

00:13:48.529 --> 00:13:50.570
want to measure the costs
and associated benefits

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.690
in some environment,
which you're

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.064
to be doing in
later experiments.

00:13:53.064 --> 00:13:56.790
So I think it's really from
a conceptual standpoint,

00:13:56.790 --> 00:14:00.850
in principle, you can
measure this in glucose,

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:03.696
but then you'd always worry,
oh, well, maybe it's different.

00:14:03.696 --> 00:14:04.195
Yeah.

00:14:04.195 --> 00:14:07.251
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:14:07.251 --> 00:14:08.630
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah, right.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:13.440
So you could have broken down--
So the other issue is that,

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.840
in principle-- and they
don't talk about this here--

00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.790
but yeah, if you add a
bunch of glucose, then

00:14:17.790 --> 00:14:19.720
you would have to have
another mutant in order

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.480
to break the glucose
repression, because if you

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.020
have this preferred
carbon source,

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.730
glucose, then you'll
naturally repress the CRP, all

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.860
of the alternative modes
of carbon metabolism

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:33.650
just because glucose
was kind of the best.

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:47.700
And what was the key conclusion
from this first data plot?

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:49.176
AUDIENCE: It's nonlinear.

00:14:49.176 --> 00:14:51.370
PROFESSOR: All right, nonlinear.

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:53.660
The cost is a function
of the lac expression.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.827
And it grows super linearly.

00:14:54.827 --> 00:14:56.284
I always forget
what the difference

00:14:56.284 --> 00:14:57.469
is in concave and convex is.

00:14:57.469 --> 00:14:59.760
I don't know if other people
have this particular brain

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.259
problem.

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:03.559
But the second
derivative is positive.

00:15:03.559 --> 00:15:05.100
In particular, that
means that if you

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.610
do draw some sort
of like line, then

00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:13.985
they have data that looks
something like-- so here

00:15:13.985 --> 00:15:15.980
is 0.5.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.790
We have something that
kind of falls below here.

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:24.880
They had about a 0.25.

00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:29.555
And it was also a little
bit below that crossed.

00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:34.100
They had a 0.75.

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.550
And then they had a 1.

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.630
Why is it that they
can't go above 1 here?

00:15:47.724 --> 00:15:49.390
Why do they not have
more data out here?

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.500
AUDIENCE: Because you
can't have more expression

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:57.450
than full expression.

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:58.900
PROFESSOR: You can't have more
expression than full expression

00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:01.020
with this promoter,
because what they are doing

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.420
is they're adding
IPTG, so they titrate

00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:07.752
between 0 and maximal
expression from this promoter.

00:16:07.752 --> 00:16:09.710
In principle, you could
always get another one.

00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:12.083
And then you should be able
to go out further, right?

00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:18.280
And at maximal
expression, they measure

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:26.695
about a 4% growth
deficit, 0.04, just

00:16:26.695 --> 00:16:28.370
to give you a sense of scale.

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:31.220
So this is 4% deficit.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.310
Now, I want to ask a
more general question.

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.560
So let's imagine that you
are measuring some quantity.

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:48.320
So we'll say this is some
quality y as a function of x.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:53.390
And let's imagine that the
true y as a function of x

00:16:53.390 --> 00:16:59.570
looks like something.

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:04.670
Now, you go and you
measure at multiple values

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:13.440
of x this curve, because
we're very interested in what

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.640
this curve looks like.

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:22.470
Now, the question is, what
fraction of the error bars

00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:42.550
will contain this
curve and, of course,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:47.500
contain this is true curve?

00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:53.804
So I'm assuming that this curve
is the god-given actual thing

00:17:53.804 --> 00:17:54.720
that you're measuring.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.020
And so you measure this
quantity with noise.

00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:04.670
So we measure this some number
of times, some number of times.

00:18:11.579 --> 00:18:12.870
Do you understand the question?

00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:19.980
So here, contained the curve.

00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.970
There, it didn't.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:29.965
So what fraction of error
bars will contain that curve?

00:18:29.965 --> 00:18:31.785
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:31.785 --> 00:18:34.990
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.530
And indeed, what we
want-- it's always good--

00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:41.260
what were the error bars
in the figure 2A in this?

00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.420
Right, well, OK, so they're
experimental error, right.

00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.170
Incidentally, how is
it that they actually

00:18:50.170 --> 00:18:51.045
measure these things?

00:18:51.045 --> 00:19:00.510
Does anybody-- And
so these are actually

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:04.600
a result of growing on
a nice [INAUDIBLE] well,

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:06.400
like a microtiter
plate, where they

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:07.650
used a checkerboard pattern.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.320
And they take 48
different cultures.

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:11.727
And they measure
the growth rates

00:19:11.727 --> 00:19:12.810
for each one individually.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:16.240
And then they're plotting the
standard error of the mean.

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.200
Do you understand what
I'm trying to ask you?

00:19:54.062 --> 00:19:56.924
AUDIENCE: So in
that case, I mean,

00:19:56.924 --> 00:20:00.077
the size of the error bars,
you just want a scaling

00:20:00.077 --> 00:20:01.910
or something,
[? if that's right, ?] because

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:03.190
the size of the error bars--

00:20:03.190 --> 00:20:04.550
PROFESSOR: Right, well--

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:05.300
AUDIENCE: I just--

00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:06.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK, so
this is a good question.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:07.075
We'll find out.

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.160
So it depends on n, where
n is the number of samples

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.075
that we took at each location.

00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:42.400
Question, yeah.

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.774
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the standard
error is just the [INAUDIBLE]?

00:20:48.412 --> 00:20:50.620
PROFESSOR: Right, so standard
error of the mean, this

00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:51.661
is an important question.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.570
What you do is you calculate
the standard deviation, divide

00:20:57.570 --> 00:21:01.560
by the square root
of n-- OK, now,

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.760
I always forget whether
it's n or n minus 1, now.

00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:09.020
We already did one
n minus 1, right?

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:12.210
So it's you measure
the standard deviation

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:15.380
of the data, the standard
deviation in y divided

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:18.200
by root n, where n is the
number of measurements

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:20.390
you took at that point.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:26.140
But of course, when you
measure the standard deviation,

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:29.590
there was already
an n minus 1, right?

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:31.390
Have I lost a minus 1?

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:34.510
Do you guys-- OK.

00:21:37.412 --> 00:21:37.912
Yeah.

00:21:37.912 --> 00:21:41.476
AUDIENCE: Isn't the standard--
I thought the standard error

00:21:41.476 --> 00:21:45.202
of the mean and not the actual
standard deviation [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:45.202 --> 00:21:46.740
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.540
And we're going to spend a
lot of time talking about what

00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:51.890
the difference is between
a standard deviation

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.290
and a standard
error of the mean.

00:21:53.290 --> 00:21:55.123
And it depends on what
you're trying to ask.

00:22:04.975 --> 00:22:07.100
Do you guys understand what
I'm trying to ask here?

00:22:09.625 --> 00:22:11.500
All right, well, let's
just see where we are,

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.790
and then we'll discuss.

00:22:12.790 --> 00:22:14.030
OK, ready?

00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:16.805
3, 2, 1.

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:29.470
All right, so we got
many A's, B's, C's.

00:22:29.470 --> 00:22:36.250
Nobody likes D. OK, but it's
very common to see that.

00:22:36.250 --> 00:22:38.920
Let's go ahead and--
it's worthwhile,

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:45.240
I think there's enough
variation to decide.

00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.970
And in particular,
between your neighbor,

00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.640
try to agree on
why or why not it

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.313
might depend on n and so forth.

00:22:54.313 --> 00:22:56.187
We'll just have a minute
to think about this.

00:22:59.369 --> 00:23:00.660
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:24:07.755 --> 00:24:09.516
PROFESSOR: So what
do you guys think?

00:24:09.516 --> 00:24:12.780
AUDIENCE: We're
still [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:14.100
PROFESSOR: OK, no, that's fine.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:15.391
AUDIENCE: [INTERPOSING VOICES].

00:24:50.072 --> 00:24:52.030
PROFESSOR: Why don't we
go ahead and reconvene,

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:56.650
so we can kind of try to figure
out what is going on here.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.330
I just want to
see if anybody has

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.647
changed their opinion as
a result of discussing

00:25:00.647 --> 00:25:01.480
with their neighbor.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:02.590
All right, let's see it.

00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:03.740
3, 2, 1.

00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.280
Some people are not even
willing to-- all right,

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.280
OK, so it's interesting.

00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.230
So now, actually,
it seems like there

00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:15.430
is some convergence to this.

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:19.790
Should I feel like that
you guys in general

00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:24.630
have more accurate votes
than past years somehow.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:26.820
I don't know.

00:25:26.820 --> 00:25:30.950
So let's try to figure
out why it might be that

00:25:30.950 --> 00:25:33.143
and what this thing
standard deviation is.

00:25:33.143 --> 00:25:35.226
Let's try to figure out
what all these things are.

00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:44.710
So the idea is that we're
going to measure some quantity,

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.820
but it's a measurement
with error.

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:49.210
And for now, we'll just assume
that the measurement error

00:25:49.210 --> 00:25:54.880
is Gaussian distributed, because
otherwise, we get confused

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:56.290
and everything.

00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:58.866
So let's say-- so
what we're going to do

00:25:58.866 --> 00:26:01.020
is we're going to measure
some quantity with error.

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:12.750
OK, so it's-- Now, what we're
interested in is not really

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.560
the width of the
resulting distribution,

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.200
because that's a
result of how accurate,

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.950
how good we are as
experimentalists.

00:26:19.950 --> 00:26:24.110
What we're really interested
in is this true quantity, so

00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:27.520
the mean of our distribution.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.500
We want to know mean.

00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:36.550
Now, if you read the
supplemental section

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:38.466
of this paper, what
you'll see is that there's

00:26:38.466 --> 00:26:42.260
a significant standard
deviation to their measurements,

00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:44.929
where the standard deviation,
they don't actually

00:26:44.929 --> 00:26:45.970
quote exactly what it is.

00:26:45.970 --> 00:26:49.350
But they have plots
of the histograms,

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:52.750
where like, for example,
this is a histogram

00:26:52.750 --> 00:26:55.270
of the different growth rate
measurements across those 48

00:26:55.270 --> 00:26:59.080
samples, and actually, in this
case, even more than that.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.160
But what you see is that
the standard deviation

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.210
might be 3%, 4%.

00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:16.400
So the standard deviation is
actually something that's big.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.570
Now the question
is, what we really

00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.202
want to now is, how the
mean of these distributions

00:27:21.202 --> 00:27:23.160
are shifting, because we
want to know something

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:27.600
about this true underlying
growth rate deficit,

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:29.330
because each
individual measurement

00:27:29.330 --> 00:27:32.750
is a rather noisy measurement.

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:34.340
And indeed, in this
case, the noise

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.500
is larger than the signal.

00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.830
But if we believe that
we don't have a shifting

00:27:38.830 --> 00:27:41.546
systematic error, then
we can average that out

00:27:41.546 --> 00:27:42.920
just by making
many measurements.

00:27:49.290 --> 00:27:51.400
So the question is,
so the standard error

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.930
of the mean, what
it's telling us about

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:58.800
is that if you measure
this quantity n times,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.930
you get some mean.

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:06.030
So let's say that
this is a-- ooh,

00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:08.170
it's a little bit of a
broad somehow Gaussian.

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:18.520
So this is a histogram of our
measurements of this thing.

00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:23.840
And what we want to know is
the mean of this distribution.

00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.830
So this is similar to our
discussion of super resolution

00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:29.440
microscopy.

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.850
And the question is,
how will the mean

00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:34.445
be distributed if you
have these n measurements?

00:28:40.070 --> 00:28:42.240
It's a Gaussian distribution.

00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:44.660
And it's certainly a
Gaussian distribution,

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.640
because of course, if
we-- what we're doing

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.480
is we're measuring a
bunch of Gaussians.

00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:51.229
And we're going to
add them all together.

00:28:51.229 --> 00:28:53.020
And then we're going
to calculate the mean.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:56.120
So we definitely get a Gaussian.

00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:58.942
And indeed, because of
the central limit theorem,

00:28:58.942 --> 00:29:01.150
this is also saying that
even if your errors were not

00:29:01.150 --> 00:29:04.892
distributed super
Gaussian, even if they

00:29:04.892 --> 00:29:07.350
were a little bit funny shaped,
the resulting distributions

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:09.310
of the means will look
more like a Gaussian.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:16.650
Now, what we often plot
is the standard error

00:29:16.650 --> 00:29:21.330
of the mean, which is kind
of the plus or minus 1 sigma

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.490
of the distribution of the mean.

00:29:24.490 --> 00:29:28.070
So if we go and we sample from
this distribution n times,

00:29:28.070 --> 00:29:29.215
we'll get some value.

00:29:29.215 --> 00:29:30.590
If we sample from
it again, we'll

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:32.032
get some other value, so forth.

00:29:32.032 --> 00:29:34.490
Now, the distribution of the
means we're going to calculate

00:29:34.490 --> 00:29:35.948
is not going to be
a representation

00:29:35.948 --> 00:29:38.450
of the full standard deviation.

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:40.150
But rather, it's
going to be suppressed

00:29:40.150 --> 00:29:42.790
by this root n, where n is the
number that we're sampling.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:45.510
So if you look at the
histogram of the means,

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.710
you're going to get a
Gaussian in here-- OK, that's

00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:54.860
not a very nice Gaussian,
but-- with a width that

00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.930
is the standard deviation
divided by root n.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:07.270
Now, if we assume that we don't
have any systematic error, then

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:12.650
this distribution of means that
you would have calculated--

00:30:12.650 --> 00:30:14.940
it's Gaussian, it's
centered on the right value,

00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.680
but about a third
of the time, it'll

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.230
be beyond the plus
or minus 1 sigma.

00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:27.537
And what that means is
that about a third of time,

00:30:27.537 --> 00:30:29.370
if you plot this standard
error of the mean,

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:32.060
it should fall off of
the kind of true curve.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:41.330
And this basically
does not depend on n.

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:45.182
And can somebody
say why it doesn't?

00:30:45.182 --> 00:30:46.150
Yeah.

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:49.054
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I think I
was sort of confusing myself,

00:30:49.054 --> 00:30:50.506
but this makes sense.

00:30:50.506 --> 00:30:55.081
So yeah, I mean, you know that
these error bars will shrink,

00:30:55.081 --> 00:30:56.524
if you take more measurements.

00:30:56.524 --> 00:30:59.420
But on the other hand,
the actual measurements

00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.090
will be closer--

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:01.090
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:02.352
AUDIENCE: --to the true value.

00:31:02.352 --> 00:31:03.351
PROFESSOR: That's right.

00:31:03.351 --> 00:31:05.510
So what happens is
that as you sample

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.160
from this distribution
a larger number n times,

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.420
then your error bars shrink,
but your measurements

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.230
get closer to the curve.

00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:14.170
And those two effects cancel.

00:31:14.170 --> 00:31:19.220
So you should end up roughly
with 2/3 of the errors bars

00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:23.200
containing this curve,
or 1/3 falling off.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.890
And I think that this is
a little bit surprising,

00:31:25.890 --> 00:31:29.940
because there's always a sense
that we feel that there's

00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:32.790
something wrong with our
measurements or something

00:31:32.790 --> 00:31:40.320
wrong with our model or whatnot,
if any error bar does not

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.210
contain the line.

00:31:41.210 --> 00:31:44.420
I mean, I feel like I often see
there's this effort that people

00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:51.220
have to try to make it so that
these error bars always overlap

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.565
with some underlying
curve that is supposed

00:31:53.565 --> 00:31:54.830
to represent reality.

00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:58.880
But that's not, in principle,
supposed to be true.

00:32:02.016 --> 00:32:05.772
Are there any questions
about where we are right now?

00:32:05.772 --> 00:32:07.580
OK.

00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:10.160
Now, what I want to do is
something slightly different,

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:15.560
which is ask-- let's say that
this is a curve that is not

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.235
the underlying reality but
is instead a fit to the data.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:28.421
How does this change
anything that we've said?

00:32:31.310 --> 00:32:33.462
Or does it?

00:32:33.462 --> 00:32:39.510
All right, well, OK, let's-- OK,
so we're going to say do fit.

00:32:39.510 --> 00:32:45.660
The question is does this
change the thing here?

00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.410
Do you understand?

00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:57.475
Change, A is Yes, B is No.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:02.770
Yes.

00:33:02.770 --> 00:33:05.752
AUDIENCE: Do you have the
same modeling for the fit

00:33:05.752 --> 00:33:07.740
as we did for the original--

00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:12.190
PROFESSOR: Yeah, well, let's say
that this was a curve predicted

00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:16.900
by some fancy
theory but that you

00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:21.324
have to specify the mass
of something and the-- so I

00:33:21.324 --> 00:33:23.490
don't know, there are two
things that are specified.

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.390
So what you do is you fit.

00:33:25.390 --> 00:33:27.270
And the question
is, does it change

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:29.530
what fraction of the
error bars you expect

00:33:29.530 --> 00:33:32.320
to contain the true curve?

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.100
Ready?

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:35.647
Is it not clear what I'm asking?

00:33:35.647 --> 00:33:39.623
AUDIENCE: But the true curve
is determined by the god.

00:33:39.623 --> 00:33:40.617
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:40.617 --> 00:33:42.890
PROFESSOR: Right, so the
truth curves-- we don't

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:46.750
need to get too much into this.

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.160
But I mean, the
reason we're doing

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.730
science is to try to look
into the mind of God, right?

00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:55.140
So we were doing
a fit to try to--

00:33:55.140 --> 00:33:58.104
AUDIENCE: But you can
fit anything to anything.

00:33:58.104 --> 00:34:00.952
You know, what does that mean?

00:34:00.952 --> 00:34:01.910
Do you see what I mean?

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:02.860
Like, I could--

00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.810
AUDIENCE: It
depends on whether--

00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:05.435
AUDIENCE: I could
get curve that passes

00:34:05.435 --> 00:34:08.082
through each and every
of these points points,

00:34:08.082 --> 00:34:10.330
if you give me
enough time with it.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:12.589
So I guess I don't
understand the question.

00:34:12.589 --> 00:34:13.422
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:34:19.494 --> 00:34:20.650
PROFESSOR: All right, yeah.

00:34:20.650 --> 00:34:24.820
OK, but I think you're arguing
for something already maybe.

00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.870
But let's just say that
this was a-- I mean,

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:33.969
let's just for concreteness
let's say that I measured at 15

00:34:33.969 --> 00:34:35.340
values of x.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.630
I have some error
bars and some error.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.530
But then I needed
three parameters

00:34:40.530 --> 00:34:41.880
to characterize this curve.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:45.246
And so those I used to fit.

00:34:45.246 --> 00:34:47.120
Are you happier with
three fitting parameters

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:49.824
and 15 measurements?

00:34:49.824 --> 00:34:51.449
All right, let's just
see where we are.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:56.460
OK, ready, 3, 2, 1.

00:34:56.460 --> 00:35:00.220
OK, so we have a majority of
A but a significant minority

00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.540
of B. So just to be
a lot more concrete,

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:06.270
can somebody say why
they're saying yes?

00:35:13.594 --> 00:35:14.094
Yeah.

00:35:14.094 --> 00:35:17.191
AUDIENCE: I guess
intuitively, [INAUDIBLE] we

00:35:17.191 --> 00:35:19.962
try to optimize the number of
error bars that go through.

00:35:19.962 --> 00:35:21.800
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so
the fit is somehow

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.929
trying to get the curve
to go near the error bars.

00:35:25.929 --> 00:35:27.470
And typically when
we do a fit, we're

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:30.180
typically trying to
minimize this mean squared

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:34.200
error or deviation from our
curve to the data point.

00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.631
How much you expect this
to make a difference?

00:35:41.631 --> 00:35:43.130
So for concreteness
again, let's say

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:53.300
that I had 15 values of x that
I was measuring things at.

00:35:53.300 --> 00:36:00.070
Now, we expect say five
of them-- five will miss

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:06.590
true curve, we decided roughly.

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:10.720
Now the question is, what
happens if we, instead

00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:13.370
of having this true curve, if
we do a fit using these three

00:36:13.370 --> 00:36:15.800
parameters?

00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.270
How much of a difference
should it make to this very,

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:22.390
very roughly?

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:38.480
We'll see-- Now, I'm asking
roughly how many of these error

00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:41.190
bars do you expect to then
miss the fitted curve?

00:36:43.890 --> 00:36:49.310
And this is we used three
fitting parameters, say.

00:36:54.610 --> 00:36:56.640
That was parameters over there.

00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.550
Do understand the question?

00:36:58.550 --> 00:37:01.190
So instead of plotting
this god-given curve,

00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:03.220
instead we're plotting
a curve that I'm

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.170
giving you, where I use three
fitting parameters to fit

00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.670
to the data.

00:37:09.410 --> 00:37:11.290
And I'm just trying
to get it roughly.

00:37:11.290 --> 00:37:14.355
I think that this is
not a rigorous statement

00:37:14.355 --> 00:37:16.230
I'm about to make, but
just so that we're all

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:17.350
roughly on the same page.

00:37:17.350 --> 00:37:20.415
All right, ready, 3, 2, 1.

00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:31.030
Right, so it'll be
somewhere in here.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:34.240
And I think this
is not quite true.

00:37:34.240 --> 00:37:39.100
But the idea is
that, in particular,

00:37:39.100 --> 00:37:43.450
if you make n
measurements and then you

00:37:43.450 --> 00:37:47.190
use n fitting
parameters, in general

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:50.960
you will get a perfect fit, i.e.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:53.780
the curve will go
through every single data

00:37:53.780 --> 00:37:57.170
point amazingly perfectly.

00:37:57.170 --> 00:38:01.830
So if I give you 15
measurements across here

00:38:01.830 --> 00:38:05.060
and then I give you a
15-degree polynomial-- I guess,

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:07.020
we only need a
14-degree polynomial

00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.180
with 15 free parameters--
then that polynomial

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.960
will go through everyone of
your data points spot on,

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:18.790
not even a question of whether
it goes through the error bars.

00:38:18.790 --> 00:38:31.742
I'm saying
literally-- and that's

00:38:31.742 --> 00:38:34.200
just because you're just solving
an equation at that stage.

00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:40.510
Now, this is a stupid statement,
except that once you're

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:44.020
kind of like in the
heat of the moment,

00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.480
eagerly trying to do some
fitting for your advisor

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.920
or whatever, it's easy to
fall into this trap, where

00:38:49.920 --> 00:38:53.169
you just kind of like
add extra parameters.

00:38:53.169 --> 00:38:55.210
I mean, I definitely
remember in graduate school,

00:38:55.210 --> 00:38:55.940
I was surprised.

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:57.981
I was like, oh, this thing,
it works wonderfully.

00:38:57.981 --> 00:39:01.380
It's like it seems to magically
goes through all my data.

00:39:01.380 --> 00:39:05.690
And then I felt very stupid
like 30 seconds later.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:08.400
But this is just
a very easy thing

00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:11.880
to screw up and forget about.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.680
So what this is
saying is that, if you

00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.930
see a curve-- if in
the course of your work

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:23.020
or if you're reading a
paper and you see some curve

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:27.430
and you want to know something
about how much information is

00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:30.810
it or whether things look
reasonable given the data,

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:33.750
it's useful to kind
of orient yourself

00:39:33.750 --> 00:39:38.040
relative to these
statements, that depending

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:40.960
on how many free parameters
you're kind of using,

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:45.810
you expect a larger or
smaller number of these data

00:39:45.810 --> 00:39:48.650
points to kind of go through
the curve that you see.

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:57.397
But I would just want
to stress that you

00:39:57.397 --> 00:39:59.855
don't want to be anywhere close
to the point where you have

00:39:59.855 --> 00:40:04.132
a number of parameters
equal to the number of kind

00:40:04.132 --> 00:40:05.590
of measurements
that you're making.

00:40:05.590 --> 00:40:09.720
And for any sort
of reasonable curve

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.580
describing what you
hope is a reality,

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:15.445
you expect some of those data
points with their error bars

00:40:15.445 --> 00:40:16.920
to kind of miss the curve.

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.340
And that doesn't
mean that they're

00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:19.300
sloppy experimentalists.

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:20.341
It doesn't mean whatever.

00:40:25.250 --> 00:40:31.640
OK, now coming back
to the task at hand,

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.460
do you understand
why they're plotting

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.670
the standard error
of the mean rather

00:40:34.670 --> 00:40:35.836
than the standard deviation?

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:41.781
Because what your interest
in, in principle, is not--

00:40:41.781 --> 00:40:43.280
the question you're
trying to answer

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.720
is not how variable
are their measurements

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.900
but to what certainty
can they claim

00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:56.847
to know the actual god-given,
real cost associated

00:40:56.847 --> 00:40:59.430
with expressing these proteins
as a function of the expression

00:40:59.430 --> 00:41:00.000
level.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.480
And for that, you really want
to ask about the standard error

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:02.158
of the mean.

00:41:07.051 --> 00:41:07.550
Great.

00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:15.450
So now, we can come
back and ask about,

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:17.750
why did I just
spend half an hour

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:22.820
talking about standard error of
the mean, standard deviations,

00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:23.650
fitting to data?

00:41:28.057 --> 00:41:30.640
Well, you guys are probably all
asking yourself that question.

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.814
But does anybody have
an answer if I-- Yeah.

00:41:33.814 --> 00:41:40.506
AUDIENCE: You can fit
with different curves

00:41:40.506 --> 00:41:42.312
if you use different things.

00:41:42.312 --> 00:41:44.770
PROFESSOR: You can fit with
different curves if you-- yeah,

00:41:44.770 --> 00:41:48.614
I think that that's hard
to argue that statement.

00:41:48.614 --> 00:41:51.030
But the statement is a little
bit like "different proteins

00:41:51.030 --> 00:41:55.350
have different expression
levels," but a little bit more

00:41:55.350 --> 00:41:57.749
concrete maybe.

00:41:57.749 --> 00:41:58.249
Yeah.

00:41:58.249 --> 00:42:00.503
AUDIENCE: So in
this case, I didn't

00:42:00.503 --> 00:42:03.079
check their calculations, but
if you have a natural line,

00:42:03.079 --> 00:42:07.426
then you can't make this
calculation of optimization.

00:42:07.426 --> 00:42:10.121
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but I
think that-- right, so--

00:42:10.121 --> 00:42:12.550
AUDIENCE: In the sense that
there won't be [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:14.450
PROFESSOR: Yeah, OK.

00:42:14.450 --> 00:42:18.000
So I think that this
is a tricky thing.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.630
The data certainly do argue
for a super linear cost.

00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:29.640
But I would say that they
argued for it rather weakly,

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:35.350
in that if you look at their
data and you just fit a line,

00:42:35.350 --> 00:42:39.510
you would say, it's maybe OK.

00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:41.640
And of course, once
again, should we

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.110
be surprised that the
quadratic fits better?

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:47.200
No.

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:50.480
And this is a very
dangerous thing,

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.639
if you're comparing models.

00:42:51.639 --> 00:42:53.930
It'll always be the case, if
you add another parameter,

00:42:53.930 --> 00:42:57.240
it will look better.

00:42:57.240 --> 00:43:01.730
But the question then
is how strong of a case

00:43:01.730 --> 00:43:03.670
should we make of this?

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:10.980
And then how important is it for
the conclusions of the study?

00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:16.390
Now, in addition to the
line and the quadratic,

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:19.820
they had another
curve in here, which

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:22.650
looks like-- let me see if I
can get it right for you guys.

00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:32.860
So this is fine, tricky thing.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:34.900
So it's the dashed
line that looks

00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.650
very similar to the
solid quadratic line.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:39.400
Can somebody remind
us what the difference

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:43.950
was between those two
non-linear curves that they had?

00:43:53.350 --> 00:43:56.950
Why do they have two curves
that look so similar?

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.610
AUDIENCE: I think the dashed
line responds to some model

00:44:10.610 --> 00:44:14.750
where there's only so much of
this certain resource that--

00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:17.840
PROFESSOR: Right, OK, so my
dashed line is their red line,

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:22.600
just to-- OK dashed
red in the paper.

00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:27.060
So it's this line where there's
a finite amount of resources

00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:29.890
or protein-making machinery
that the cell has.

00:44:29.890 --> 00:44:32.920
And if you use them up, then
you don't get any growth.

00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:36.020
And of course, that
statement kind of

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.540
has to be true on some level.

00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:39.455
And the question is whether--

00:44:39.455 --> 00:44:40.826
AUDIENCE: --that scale is--

00:44:40.826 --> 00:44:42.450
PROFESSOR: --it's
relevant here, right.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:48.890
Certainly, I would
say that one question

00:44:48.890 --> 00:44:52.920
is whether you can reject
the hypothesis that this cost

00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.810
function is a line.

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.940
Another question is whether you
can distinguish between the two

00:44:56.940 --> 00:45:01.490
quadratic or the two non-linear
curves based on the data.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.720
And I think the answer
to the second question

00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:05.960
is certainly not.

00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:07.510
And they don't
claim that they can.

00:45:10.410 --> 00:45:12.590
But it's important to
just note that it's

00:45:12.590 --> 00:45:15.320
just impossible for
them to assume--

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:19.180
I mean, those curves are so, so
similar over the entire range

00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:20.900
where they have
data that it's going

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.420
to be possible to
distinguish those two things.

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:28.620
But does it matter which
of the two cost functions

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:30.630
is the true cost function?

00:45:33.595 --> 00:45:34.095
Yeah.

00:45:34.095 --> 00:45:37.560
AUDIENCE: Is it because
the [INAUDIBLE] where

00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.045
the marginal
benefits become zero

00:45:39.045 --> 00:45:43.005
is like inside the range where
the cost functions are still

00:45:43.005 --> 00:45:44.985
exactly the same?

00:45:44.985 --> 00:45:46.060
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

00:45:46.060 --> 00:45:48.435
So what you're saying is that
the two cost functions they

00:45:48.435 --> 00:45:53.100
have they behave similarly
over the range that is relevant

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:56.350
maybe, so then therefore,
it doesn't matter.

00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:59.749
Is that-- or am I-- OK.

00:45:59.749 --> 00:46:01.790
So why do they have to
cost functions there then,

00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.390
why two non-linear
cost functions?

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:14.134
Just to provide variety
in our modeling?

00:46:14.134 --> 00:46:14.634
Yep.

00:46:14.634 --> 00:46:17.094
AUDIENCE: They were doing
another experiment later on,

00:46:17.094 --> 00:46:22.506
and they said something
like something was saturated

00:46:22.506 --> 00:46:24.774
and that was modeled by
the second cost function.

00:46:24.774 --> 00:46:25.690
PROFESSOR: Right, yes.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:26.770
That's right.

00:46:26.770 --> 00:46:28.947
And what's the later
experiment they're going to do,

00:46:28.947 --> 00:46:29.780
just so that we're--

00:46:34.532 --> 00:46:36.115
AUDIENCE: You should
ask somebody else

00:46:36.115 --> 00:46:37.202
to explain that, not me.

00:46:37.202 --> 00:46:38.910
PROFESSOR: You regret
opening your mouth.

00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:40.984
No, OK.

00:46:40.984 --> 00:46:42.400
So yeah, so what
is the experiment

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:45.291
that they're going to do?

00:46:45.291 --> 00:46:47.159
AUDIENCE: Measuring the benefit?

00:46:47.159 --> 00:46:49.533
PROFESSOR: So next, they're
going to measure the benefit.

00:46:49.533 --> 00:46:52.730
But this question about
the two cost functions

00:46:52.730 --> 00:46:54.802
is not somehow relevant
yet for the benefit part.

00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:02.420
Yes.

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:04.900
AUDIENCE: So they're doing it
in different concentrations

00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:08.620
of lactose and seeing if
the protein expression could

00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:09.370
adapt [INAUDIBLE].

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.590
PROFESSOR: Right,
after a long time.

00:47:11.590 --> 00:47:13.880
So they actually do laboratory
evolution experiments,

00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.780
where they grow these
bacterial populations

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.820
in different lactose
concentrations.

00:47:18.820 --> 00:47:21.630
And then they look to see
what level of the lac operon

00:47:21.630 --> 00:47:25.146
expression does the
population evolve to.

00:47:25.146 --> 00:47:26.520
So what they're
trying to do here

00:47:26.520 --> 00:47:28.470
is they're trying
to say, OK, well,

00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:31.680
we can measure some cost as
a function of expression.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.540
Maybe we can measure
some benefits

00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.792
as a function of expression.

00:47:34.792 --> 00:47:36.250
And then from that,
we'd like to be

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:38.940
able to predict where the
population will evolve to.

00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.604
And they had these two
non-linear cost functions,

00:47:52.604 --> 00:47:55.020
which based on the data they
have, they can't distinguish.

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:57.519
But they say, oh, well, they're
both kind of reasonable cost

00:47:57.519 --> 00:47:58.640
functions.

00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.250
And in some ways,
maybe the problem

00:48:00.250 --> 00:48:03.550
here is that the two
costs functions end up

00:48:03.550 --> 00:48:07.620
being wildly different in terms
of predicting what happens

00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:11.849
for large lac concentrations,
where you would want

00:48:11.849 --> 00:48:13.140
to express more of the protein.

00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:23.351
Do you guys-- do you
remember this or not?

00:48:23.351 --> 00:48:23.850
Sort of.

00:48:26.687 --> 00:48:28.770
And that's actually-- well,
you might as well just

00:48:28.770 --> 00:48:30.230
look at that.

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:33.590
So that's figure 4.

00:48:33.590 --> 00:48:35.900
That's the normalized
lacZ activity

00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:37.336
that the populations
evolve to as

00:48:37.336 --> 00:48:38.960
a function of the
lactose concentration

00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:39.820
they're evolving in.

00:48:39.820 --> 00:48:43.710
And what you see is that
this red curve corresponding

00:48:43.710 --> 00:48:49.020
to the finite resources cost
function, it explains the data.

00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.800
Whereas, the other
ones very much do not.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:59.230
And that's just because
these other models then

00:48:59.230 --> 00:49:02.570
would predict that if you grow
the cells in a lot of lactose

00:49:02.570 --> 00:49:05.800
they should express
out to five times

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:08.442
the lac expression, much,
much, much more, which is not

00:49:08.442 --> 00:49:09.650
what they see experimentally.

00:49:13.860 --> 00:49:14.360
Yes.

00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.762
AUDIENCE: Is there
another way to put

00:49:17.762 --> 00:49:21.636
a bound on the expression,
because of this expression

00:49:21.636 --> 00:49:22.136
we have?

00:49:22.136 --> 00:49:26.024
You mentioned for that
promoter, it's not possible to--

00:49:26.024 --> 00:49:28.080
PROFESSOR: OK, but
the idea of evolution

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:31.890
is that evolution can make
it a stronger promoter.

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:35.070
So you guys, one statement
is, given this DNA sequence

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.290
at that promoter, how much
expression can you get?

00:49:37.290 --> 00:49:40.630
And the most you can get is this
amount that's normalized to 1.

00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:43.071
But if you make mutations
in that promoter,

00:49:43.071 --> 00:49:44.320
then you could go out further.

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:51.990
So the question now is,
after we kind of tell you

00:49:51.990 --> 00:49:54.210
the results of these
evolution experiments,

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:59.200
how much should that favor
this dashed red line,

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.810
this super linear cost
function with finite resources?

00:50:04.810 --> 00:50:11.810
And on one level, you'd say, oh,
well, that's pretty compelling.

00:50:11.810 --> 00:50:16.540
On another level,
later people that

00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:21.230
have come and measured this
find that it's basically a line.

00:50:21.230 --> 00:50:23.390
So are there any questions?

00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:29.360
So it seems to basically be
not true within this range.

00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:31.420
It is the case that if
you go out far enough,

00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:32.890
then the growth does go to 0.

00:50:32.890 --> 00:50:36.341
But that's much further out.

00:50:36.341 --> 00:50:36.840
Yes.

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.325
AUDIENCE: After they--
on the experiment,

00:50:39.325 --> 00:50:42.801
they had [INAUDIBLE] expression
protein at the [INAUDIBLE]

00:50:42.801 --> 00:50:43.301
level.

00:50:43.301 --> 00:50:44.957
Why didn't they go back and
do the experiment again, just

00:50:44.957 --> 00:50:45.786
to see [INAUDIBLE]?

00:50:45.786 --> 00:50:47.550
PROFESSOR: OK, so
actually, one of these

00:50:47.550 --> 00:50:53.220
curves-- so the triangle,
the sort of teal triangle,

00:50:53.220 --> 00:50:54.870
it is indeed higher up.

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.330
And it's kind of here.

00:50:57.330 --> 00:51:01.000
So they do have a data point
that is further beyond and is,

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.030
again, above that curve.

00:51:03.030 --> 00:51:06.560
So that does provide
somewhat further support

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.892
for a non-linear model.

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:13.860
But again, there's a question
of how strong that should be

00:51:13.860 --> 00:51:15.650
and so forth.

00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:19.030
And indeed, I'd
say, for example,

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:21.620
Terry Hwa has
spent a lot of time

00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:26.450
characterizing growth rates as
a function of many, many things.

00:51:26.450 --> 00:51:33.000
And if you measure the
relative growth rate

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:41.504
as a function of a non-useful
protein expression--

00:51:41.504 --> 00:51:43.420
and what he finds is
that this thing basically

00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:46.430
looks like a line in this axis.

00:51:46.430 --> 00:51:48.805
And it saturates
at around if you're

00:51:48.805 --> 00:51:55.740
at 30% maybe of total
protein expression.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:57.600
So this is a lot.

00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:01.125
But this is kind of where the
cell just can't handle that.

00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:07.530
So Terry Hwa has
recently been exploring

00:52:07.530 --> 00:52:09.780
a lot of these sort of
phenomenological growth

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:14.830
laws, where he imposes
costs of various sorts

00:52:14.830 --> 00:52:17.570
and then looks at how the
cell kind of responds.

00:52:17.570 --> 00:52:21.020
And what he finds is just
a remarkably large number

00:52:21.020 --> 00:52:27.410
of lines in various spaces
that I find very surprising,

00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:29.070
but that he can
understand using kind

00:52:29.070 --> 00:52:31.376
of some phenomenological
modeling.

00:52:31.376 --> 00:52:34.020
But this is one of
like a dozen lines

00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:37.060
that he sees of various
axes doing things.

00:52:37.060 --> 00:52:39.340
But the point here is
that, as a function

00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.575
of the level of expression of
these non-useful proteins, what

00:52:42.575 --> 00:52:45.390
he sees is that for a variety of
different proteins-- including

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:48.897
beta-gal but also beta-lactamase
and other proteins that are not

00:52:48.897 --> 00:52:51.230
being used in that particular
environment-- what he sees

00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:54.850
is that there's
basically a linear cost

00:52:54.850 --> 00:53:03.900
growth, as you impose this
non-useful protein expression.

00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:07.120
So I'd say that
this basic statement

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:10.660
of it being not-- the statement
of cost being super linear, I

00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:15.130
think, ends up not being true.

00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:18.280
Now, what does it
mean for this paper?

00:53:29.104 --> 00:53:32.056
AUDIENCE: I mean, they still
presented with same hypothesis

00:53:32.056 --> 00:53:35.132
and had these data to
back up some of it.

00:53:35.132 --> 00:53:36.090
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:53:36.090 --> 00:53:39.770
So it's a very
interesting hypothesis.

00:53:39.770 --> 00:53:41.480
They did nice
evolution experiments,

00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.430
where they saw the population
adapt to different levels.

00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:48.930
But what does it mean
about the predictions,

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:50.950
in particular, in the
sense that if you measure

00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:52.590
cost and benefits, then
you want to predict

00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:53.715
where it's going to evolve.

00:53:57.350 --> 00:53:58.170
What happens?

00:53:58.170 --> 00:54:01.510
If it's the case that cost
as a function of expression

00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:02.930
is actually linear,
then what does

00:54:02.930 --> 00:54:05.750
that mean for their ability to
predict what's going to happen?

00:54:23.462 --> 00:54:26.232
AUDIENCE: Seems like if
they use their same model

00:54:26.232 --> 00:54:29.148
for the benefit in
this linear cost,

00:54:29.148 --> 00:54:32.042
that their predictions would
be really off [INAUDIBLE].

00:54:32.042 --> 00:54:33.000
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.660
So the problem is that if you
actually use a linear function

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:40.170
here, then their
model doesn't even

00:54:40.170 --> 00:54:44.635
predict that there should be an
optimum, because their benefit

00:54:44.635 --> 00:54:46.260
function ends up also
being essentially

00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:49.390
linear with the amount of
this protein expressed.

00:54:49.390 --> 00:54:56.460
So if you have two lines-- so
overall growth is something

00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:59.320
like goes as
benefits minus costs.

00:55:02.490 --> 00:55:07.340
And maybe this is
a relative growth.

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:15.340
So if you have a line here
and a line here, no optimum.

00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:18.480
So that's kind of a bummer.

00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:24.560
But it doesn't mean that
that's-- in biology,

00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:26.050
eventually things
are non-linear,

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:27.590
so there should be some optimum.

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:28.965
And actually, what
I would say is

00:55:28.965 --> 00:55:31.330
that I think that the
non-linearity is probably

00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:32.830
actually here.

00:55:32.830 --> 00:55:34.790
That's the non-linearity
that's relevant,

00:55:34.790 --> 00:55:39.150
maybe, is dominated on the
benefit side rather than

00:55:39.150 --> 00:55:41.572
the cost side.

00:55:41.572 --> 00:55:43.030
My guess as to
what's going on here

00:55:43.030 --> 00:55:46.590
is that rather than the
costs growing super linearly

00:55:46.590 --> 00:55:48.510
with the expression
level, rather

00:55:48.510 --> 00:55:52.280
the benefits will be sub-linear
with the expression level.

00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:58.040
And why might that be?

00:56:06.626 --> 00:56:08.740
AUDIENCE: We're just
seeing them apart,

00:56:08.740 --> 00:56:11.480
splitting up more lactose
that's useful, just so it

00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.824
can't metabolize more of it.

00:56:12.824 --> 00:56:14.640
PROFESSOR: Right, you
know, at some point,

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:18.310
it's just that the cell
doesn't need more sugar.

00:56:18.310 --> 00:56:20.140
And then it's not
going to be as useful.

00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.640
And even before you
get to that regime,

00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:25.700
I think there are various
ways in which cells

00:56:25.700 --> 00:56:28.990
may be able to use
the sugar more or less

00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:31.490
efficiently, depending on how
much they have it, which means

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:35.360
that as-- and this is just
like for us, the first slice

00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:36.517
of pizza is great.

00:56:36.517 --> 00:56:38.100
But then once you're
at the fifth one,

00:56:38.100 --> 00:56:40.580
you start to feel
a little bit full.

00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:47.020
So in general benefits as
a function of anything,

00:56:47.020 --> 00:56:48.880
should have some
saturating behavior.

00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:55.630
And my sense is that
this is basically

00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:58.510
why there's an optimum here.

00:56:58.510 --> 00:57:04.640
Now, of course, I'd say that
all these cost functions

00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:06.520
behave very similarly in here.

00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.500
So the predictions
that they make in here

00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.020
are really not very sensitive
to which of the cost functions

00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.520
they use.

00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:15.710
And those are all still
then relevant and valid.

00:57:15.710 --> 00:57:17.640
The question is just
trying to predict

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:19.690
what happens beyond the
range that you have data

00:57:19.690 --> 00:57:21.570
is very hard, because
it depends very

00:57:21.570 --> 00:57:24.060
much on what your curve
does past that region.

00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.560
So I guess I've made
an argument that I

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:35.060
think that maybe
what's happening

00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.059
is that the benefit
function here is non-linear.

00:57:37.059 --> 00:57:39.540
But what did they actually
do to measure the benefits,

00:57:39.540 --> 00:57:42.920
because this is not I think
totally obvious either?

00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:08.649
So what should I be plotting?

00:58:08.649 --> 00:58:10.440
Well, this is still a
relative growth rate.

00:58:15.210 --> 00:58:19.530
And here, this was actually
lactose concentrations.

00:58:19.530 --> 00:58:21.964
So this is not lac
expression, which

00:58:21.964 --> 00:58:24.130
is the most obvious thing
that you would want to do,

00:58:24.130 --> 00:58:26.517
but that's harder.

00:58:26.517 --> 00:58:28.100
And what they show
is that their model

00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:30.690
is sort of consistent
on this axis.

00:58:30.690 --> 00:58:31.910
This is external lactose.

00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:41.870
And the idea is
that-- here is 0--

00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:45.860
in the absence of any lactose,
if you induce the lac operon,

00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:50.400
then you're at this minus
4 and 1/2% or whatnot.

00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:54.650
So it kind of starts
out down here.

00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:58.300
And then up here, it
comes out up to above 0.1.

00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.620
So this is the
first 4, maybe 4.5%.

00:59:01.620 --> 00:59:03.970
This is up here at 10%.

00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:09.730
And you end up with
a curve that kind of

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:15.760
goes from 4% or 5% deficit
up to 10% or 11% advantage.

00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.820
And this is at full
induction of the lac operon.

00:59:22.870 --> 00:59:26.860
What this is saying
is that if you're

00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:31.890
making the proteins to break
down and consume lactose,

00:59:31.890 --> 00:59:33.880
then there's a cost.

00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:35.500
That's just how they plotted it.

00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:38.620
But that the benefits do
indeed outweigh the costs

00:59:38.620 --> 00:59:40.180
at some concentration
of lactose.

00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:48.160
But then here,
there's a saturation.

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:50.380
And here, the saturation
in their model--

00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:53.430
they get a saturation
just because

00:59:53.430 --> 00:59:56.672
of the dynamics of import.

00:59:56.672 --> 00:59:58.130
So what they assume
is that there's

00:59:58.130 --> 01:00:01.990
a Michaelis-Menten
kinetics for import.

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:10.790
So the import rate kind of
goes as the concentration

01:00:10.790 --> 01:00:16.390
of the lactose divided by some
k plus the concentration again

01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:21.615
of lactose, so
Michaelis-Menten dynamics.

01:00:25.140 --> 01:00:27.932
But of course, if you have
more of the protein lacY,

01:00:27.932 --> 01:00:29.390
then you'll be able
to import more.

01:00:32.452 --> 01:00:33.910
So just because
you have saturation

01:00:33.910 --> 01:00:36.430
as a function of
lactose does not

01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:38.340
mean that you'll have
saturation in terms

01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:43.027
of the number of proteins
that you're making.

01:00:43.027 --> 01:00:44.610
Do you understand
why I'm saying that?

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:51.657
And indeed, I would say
that many underlying models

01:00:51.657 --> 01:00:53.740
could have been consistent
with this data as well.

01:00:53.740 --> 01:00:57.540
So I'd say that
their data does not

01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:02.260
reject the hypothesis that the
benefit function is sublinear.

01:01:06.044 --> 01:01:06.544
Yeah.

01:01:06.544 --> 01:01:08.764
AUDIENCE: So that
you just said if you

01:01:08.764 --> 01:01:12.350
have more lacY and
import more and it would

01:01:12.350 --> 01:01:13.700
saturate to an [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:18.321
So you could imagine that by
evolution something happened

01:01:18.321 --> 01:01:18.820
there.

01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:22.250
So why would you even
expect the prediction

01:01:22.250 --> 01:01:24.130
of this cost-benefit analysis?

01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:28.300
You see what I mean?

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:31.760
PROFESSOR: OK, so you're
saying that evolution

01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.710
might be able to change
other things as well

01:01:33.710 --> 01:01:35.020
to kind of fiddle-- yeah.

01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:36.787
I think this is an
important question.

01:01:36.787 --> 01:01:38.370
I think the basic
answer is that there

01:01:38.370 --> 01:01:40.495
are some things that are
easier for evolution to do

01:01:40.495 --> 01:01:41.850
than others.

01:01:41.850 --> 01:01:46.240
And also that somethings have
maybe already been optimized.

01:01:46.240 --> 01:01:48.820
Now, relevant to
this point, so they

01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:51.100
did these laboratory
evolution experiments,

01:01:51.100 --> 01:01:57.161
and there was one category of
mutation that they did not see.

01:01:57.161 --> 01:01:58.660
Does anybody remember
what that was?

01:02:09.009 --> 01:02:10.800
What's the most
straightforward way of kind

01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:14.080
of getting around all this
cost-benefit discussion

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.160
that we've just had?

01:02:37.137 --> 01:02:38.720
So the one thing
that they did not see

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:43.100
was significant
improvements in the enzyme.

01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:46.190
So they checked, and they
found that they did not

01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:49.550
see any increase the
lacZ activity normalized

01:02:49.550 --> 01:02:53.400
by the amount of the
lacZ that was being made.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.610
Now, that might make sense,
because if this enzyme has

01:02:56.610 --> 01:03:00.510
already been gone
through millions of years

01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:03.820
of optimization to
break down lactose,

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:06.430
then it's reasonable to say,
oh, well, in the next five

01:03:06.430 --> 01:03:10.484
generations in the lab,
it maybe won't improve.

01:03:10.484 --> 01:03:12.650
Of course, you always have
to be careful about this,

01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:17.470
because it could be that some
sequence slash structure is

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:20.269
best when you're thinking
about-- when is it

01:03:20.269 --> 01:03:21.560
that E. coli might see lactose?

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.350
Our gut.

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:30.810
So you imagine you have
bacteria in the gut.

01:03:30.810 --> 01:03:33.520
That's a different
environment than in the lab.

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:36.650
So it could be very
well that the enzyme,

01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:39.120
because of the pH and
all these other things,

01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.120
the enzyme actually
could adapt to the lab,

01:03:42.120 --> 01:03:44.871
even though it may have already
been adapted to our gut.

01:03:44.871 --> 01:03:47.370
So you have to got to be careful
about this kind of argument

01:03:47.370 --> 01:03:49.680
always.

01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:51.970
But of course, once you see
the result, then you say,

01:03:51.970 --> 01:03:53.345
oh, well, that's
because of this.

01:03:56.086 --> 01:03:57.960
So I just want to make
sure that we know what

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.126
these experiments look like.

01:03:59.126 --> 01:04:01.115
So they went for
500 generations.

01:04:07.270 --> 01:04:11.180
So it's useful to ask how
long this experiment should

01:04:11.180 --> 01:04:11.680
have taken.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:35.695
Is it closest to three
days, three weeks?

01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:53.940
Anytime you read
about an experiment,

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.174
it's useful just to have some
notion of what the authors went

01:04:57.174 --> 01:04:59.174
through in order to bring
you the results you're

01:04:59.174 --> 01:04:59.876
reading about.

01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:10.420
If you are not sure, you
can just make a guess.

01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:15.210
OK, ready, 3, 2, 1.

01:05:15.210 --> 01:05:18.040
All right, so we have some
number of A's, some number

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:21.150
of B's, and a couple of C's.

01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:24.390
Well, one thing
you might say is,

01:05:24.390 --> 01:05:27.690
how fast can E. coli divide?

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:30.015
OK, on one level, you may
say oh, about 20 minutes.

01:05:32.930 --> 01:05:35.950
That should give us what?

01:05:35.950 --> 01:05:38.570
75-ish generations a day.

01:05:38.570 --> 01:05:46.940
So we should be able to get here
in a week or something, maybe.

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:51.540
But that's not what they
did, for several reasons.

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:54.790
First of all, this
would be in rich media.

01:05:54.790 --> 01:05:57.480
In the environment that
they are doing this in,

01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:58.800
it's a bit slower.

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:04.420
But that would get you maybe
to the two or three-week mark.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:06.162
But that still is
not what happened.

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.870
They actually had to
go for three months.

01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:14.130
And this is because
experiments are not always

01:06:14.130 --> 01:06:16.070
keeping cells
constantly dividing

01:06:16.070 --> 01:06:18.720
at their maximal rates.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:20.340
The standard way
that we do this is

01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.570
what's known as kind
of daily batch culture.

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:28.610
And does anybody know how
much they diluted by each day?

01:06:34.330 --> 01:06:38.950
Yeah, so I think it was
diluting by a factor of 100.

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:47.810
So it's daily batch
culture with 100x dilution,

01:06:47.810 --> 01:06:52.130
which corresponds to about
6.6 generations per day.

01:06:56.250 --> 01:06:59.085
So this is very
far from what you

01:06:59.085 --> 01:07:01.740
would think of as kind of the
best they could possibly do.

01:07:06.862 --> 01:07:08.320
And what it means
is that, yeah, it

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.920
does take about
three months for them

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:13.010
to have done this experiment.

01:07:13.010 --> 01:07:19.900
It also means that if you look
at the number over the course

01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:27.750
of each day, this is n max.

01:07:27.750 --> 01:07:31.600
And they dilute-- this
is n max over 100--

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:36.170
so they dilute by
a factor of 100.

01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:40.066
When you transfer cells
from a saturated state

01:07:40.066 --> 01:07:42.440
into new environment, do they
start dividing immediately,

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.410
for those of you who have
done this experiment?

01:07:44.410 --> 01:07:45.130
No.

01:07:45.130 --> 01:07:50.362
It's going to take an hour
or two for them to get going.

01:07:50.362 --> 01:07:52.070
But then they're going
to start dividing.

01:07:52.070 --> 01:08:00.135
And this on a log scale maybe--
log N. And what you'll see

01:08:00.135 --> 01:08:02.260
is they kind of go-- they're
dividing exponentially

01:08:02.260 --> 01:08:04.190
and then they saturate.

01:08:04.190 --> 01:08:06.850
Indeed, they're going
to saturate for about

01:08:06.850 --> 01:08:07.860
a fair amount of time.

01:08:07.860 --> 01:08:10.560
So this might be an hour or two.

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:14.710
This might be say five hours.

01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:16.950
But then you still have
another roughly 20 hours

01:08:16.950 --> 01:08:20.270
to go before the next dilution.

01:08:23.279 --> 01:08:25.790
And then we repeat.

01:08:25.790 --> 01:08:28.443
So they actually saturated for
a fair fraction of the day.

01:08:32.700 --> 01:08:35.879
Now, in all these discussions
of laboratory evolution--

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:37.420
and in many of the
calculations we're

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:41.350
going to be doing over
the next couple of weeks--

01:08:41.350 --> 01:08:44.180
we'll typically assume that
what is being optimized

01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.339
is the growth rate,
the rate of division.

01:08:47.339 --> 01:08:49.380
But you can imagine there
being other things that

01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:51.621
might possibly be
optimized in the course

01:08:51.621 --> 01:08:52.870
of these sorts of experiments.

01:08:52.870 --> 01:08:55.910
Can somebody volunteer
what are other things?

01:09:00.338 --> 01:09:02.306
AUDIENCE: Maximum density?

01:09:02.306 --> 01:09:04.569
PROFESSOR: Right, so
you could imagine,

01:09:04.569 --> 01:09:08.279
if you could just eke out
one more division out there,

01:09:08.279 --> 01:09:10.529
then you could get an advantage.

01:09:10.529 --> 01:09:12.680
And there's a whole set
of interesting things,

01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:13.729
these growth advantage.

01:09:13.729 --> 01:09:16.540
It's stationary phase
or the GASP mutants,

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:20.040
where the focus is on
trying to do well here.

01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:23.660
And also you can
imagine related maybe,

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:27.090
if you do better
out for this period,

01:09:27.090 --> 01:09:29.310
cells will start
dying eventually.

01:09:29.310 --> 01:09:31.434
So if you have a lower rate
of death at saturation,

01:09:31.434 --> 01:09:34.930
then you can also spread.

01:09:34.930 --> 01:09:36.136
Other-- yep.

01:09:36.136 --> 01:09:38.571
AUDIENCE: Sorry, can I
ask a quick question?

01:09:38.571 --> 01:09:43.207
What's a possible reason for
the initial [INAUDIBLE] used

01:09:43.207 --> 01:09:44.415
[INAUDIBLE] at the beginning?

01:09:44.415 --> 01:09:45.899
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

01:09:45.899 --> 01:09:50.870
So I think it's basically that
when the cells are saturated,

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:55.570
they generally enter a rather
distinct physiological state,

01:09:55.570 --> 01:09:58.070
as compared to the
dividing state.

01:09:58.070 --> 01:10:01.340
And I think the longer they
sit in this saturated phase,

01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:03.580
the longer it's going to
take them to get going

01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:06.620
in the next day, for example.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.260
And it's also the case that
cells in saturated culture

01:10:10.260 --> 01:10:12.840
tend to be more resistant to
a variety of perturbations

01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:17.340
of various sorts-- so if you're
talking about heat, salt, this,

01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.550
that, and the other thing.

01:10:19.550 --> 01:10:22.210
What's something else they
could be optimized here?

01:10:29.906 --> 01:10:31.990
If you were imagining
you're a cell,

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:35.004
you want to spread,
what would you do?

01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:41.935
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:41.935 --> 01:10:42.810
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

01:10:42.810 --> 01:10:45.280
So we're saying that
the media is specified

01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:46.580
by the experimentalist.

01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:53.510
So you're the cell in
this Gedanken experiment.

01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:54.919
AUDIENCE: You'd divide yourself.

01:10:54.919 --> 01:10:57.210
PROFESSOR: Right, so you can
eat the other cells, yeah.

01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:01.990
Well, and in particular,
actually out here, this

01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:03.970
is part of how the
GASP mutants spread,

01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:06.230
is that when other
cells start to die,

01:11:06.230 --> 01:11:07.700
they lyse their contents.

01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.740
And then the cells
that are surviving

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.760
can actually eat
the contents, yeah.

01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:16.204
AUDIENCE: Is this
a way to coordinate

01:11:16.204 --> 01:11:21.124
between different cells, so
that they can sort of evenly

01:11:21.124 --> 01:11:22.900
distribute themselves
in the media,

01:11:22.900 --> 01:11:24.835
so you don't have to many--

01:11:24.835 --> 01:11:25.710
PROFESSOR: OK, right.

01:11:25.710 --> 01:11:28.260
So I'm actually assuming
here it's well mixed,

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.950
so that in principle
would not be an issue.

01:11:31.950 --> 01:11:34.490
But yeah, so you can
imagine spatial effects

01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:36.520
of various sorts being relevant.

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.470
I guess I just drew this
up here to highlight

01:11:39.470 --> 01:11:43.690
that, in principle, you can
also decrease the lag time.

01:11:46.450 --> 01:11:50.680
So if you start
dividing more rapidly

01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:53.762
at the beginning of
the day, then you'll

01:11:53.762 --> 01:11:55.220
get to spread before
your neighbors

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.646
and your genotypes
will indeed spread.

01:11:57.646 --> 01:11:58.440
Yep.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:12:02.540
AUDIENCE: So I just know
so little about cells,

01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:07.832
but is it true that
a lot of the cells

01:12:07.832 --> 01:12:12.470
could survive and be the same
cell for that whole duration

01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:14.852
when they were in
the stationary phase?

01:12:14.852 --> 01:12:16.600
PROFESSOR: You're
asking whether the--

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.065
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
whether a cell that

01:12:18.065 --> 01:12:19.981
entered the beginning
of the stationary phase,

01:12:19.981 --> 01:12:22.400
that same cell would have
a pretty good chance of--

01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:26.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, over I think
this sort of 12-hour type

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:28.590
period, I think
the answer is yes.

01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:31.870
But if you go for
an extra day or two,

01:12:31.870 --> 01:12:34.531
then I think you can start
getting extensive cell death.

01:12:34.531 --> 01:12:36.252
AUDIENCE: Because
then who knows?

01:12:36.252 --> 01:12:38.752
Maybe long enough, though, they
would develop a little clock

01:12:38.752 --> 01:12:40.450
to let them know that
it was about to split.

01:12:40.450 --> 01:12:41.366
PROFESSOR: Yes, right.

01:12:41.366 --> 01:12:42.932
Yeah, so people
have thought about--

01:12:42.932 --> 01:12:44.015
and I'm not sure if this--

01:12:44.015 --> 01:12:45.556
AUDIENCE: And it
seems like it would.

01:12:45.556 --> 01:12:47.589
PROFESSOR: --particular
effect is-- yeah, right.

01:12:47.589 --> 01:12:49.630
But I just want to mention
that this is something

01:12:49.630 --> 01:12:51.463
that you kind of maybe
would expect, indeed,

01:12:51.463 --> 01:12:54.640
you see in these-- so they're a
famous set of experiments done

01:12:54.640 --> 01:13:01.920
by Richard Lenski at Michigan
State, where he's been dividing

01:13:01.920 --> 01:13:07.280
six or eight-- doing daily
batch dilutions of equal E. coli

01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.940
cultures now for decades.

01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:13.980
So he started, I don't
know, late '80s or so.

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.710
I don't know if
you guys remember.

01:13:15.710 --> 01:13:18.340
So he's gone tens of
thousands of generations

01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.480
and has seen a bunch
of remarkable things.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:23.012
One of the things
that he has seen,

01:13:23.012 --> 01:13:24.720
as you might have
expected, is a decrease

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:27.275
in the lag time of
the vector area.

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:40.500
So what we have now is a
situation where they add IPTG,

01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:44.200
so that all the cells
are in principle

01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.660
start out expressing
the lac operon.

01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:50.190
And then they grow
the cells over time.

01:13:50.190 --> 01:13:58.420
And what they see is that the
lacZ activity, it starts out

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:03.660
at being 1, normalized,
for all the cultures,

01:14:03.660 --> 01:14:05.920
because there's IPTG,
so it doesn't matter

01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.270
how much lactose there is.

01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:13.871
But what they see
is that over time,

01:14:13.871 --> 01:14:15.370
they see things
that look like this.

01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:25.740
So the 0.5 millimolar lactose
didn't change very much.

01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:32.580
But if you look at some of
the others, like no lactose,

01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:35.380
there was significant
decrease in expression.

01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:38.945
Whereas, up here at, for
example, 2 millimolar lactose,

01:14:38.945 --> 01:14:39.820
they see an increase.

01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:46.290
So what you see is
that there really

01:14:46.290 --> 01:14:53.150
are evolutionary changes
of these strains, because--

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:57.000
and it's very, very
relevant that they

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.150
had IPTG in the media.

01:14:59.150 --> 01:15:01.305
So if they did this
experiment without IPTG,

01:15:01.305 --> 01:15:05.770
do you have any sense of
what would kind of happen

01:15:05.770 --> 01:15:06.350
to the cells?

01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:09.894
I mean, how would that
change the results?

01:15:09.894 --> 01:15:10.394
Yep.

01:15:10.394 --> 01:15:11.964
AUDIENCE: The
expression level would

01:15:11.964 --> 01:15:13.691
be determined by [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:13.691 --> 01:15:15.830
PROFESSOR: Right, so
the expression would

01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:17.660
be determined by the lactose.

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:21.020
But let's say that
after 500 generations,

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:23.412
we put them all in a
millimolar lactose.

01:15:23.412 --> 01:15:25.370
How different do you
think they're going to be?

01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:37.180
I mean, do think that the
culture grown, for example,

01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.950
in the absence of
lactose, do you

01:15:38.950 --> 01:15:42.870
think that it would still be
able to eat lactose after 500

01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:44.775
generations in that experiment?

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.674
Hm?

01:15:52.674 --> 01:15:53.560
AUDIENCE: Yes.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.410
PROFESSOR: Yes, OK.

01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:55.868
And yeah, so what's
the difference?

01:15:55.868 --> 01:15:58.472
I mean, why are you
saying yes or what's the--

01:15:58.472 --> 01:15:59.930
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.390
I don't know how hard it is--

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:02.832
PROFESSOR: Well, yeah, right.

01:16:02.832 --> 01:16:04.290
So this is an
experiment with IPTG.

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.990
And now, I'm just trying
to think about or imagine

01:16:10.990 --> 01:16:13.580
what would have happened if they
had done the same experiment

01:16:13.580 --> 01:16:16.950
without IPTG just growing
in that environment,

01:16:16.950 --> 01:16:24.912
in particular, if you grow minus
IPTG and then minus lactose

01:16:24.912 --> 01:16:25.745
for 500 generations?

01:16:29.902 --> 01:16:31.360
And then what I
want to ask is, OK,

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.776
let's say that you go over
there and you just add lactose.

01:16:35.597 --> 01:16:38.180
Will the cells, do you think,
be able to grow and the lactose?

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:41.700
OK.

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:47.100
And so why is it that here
the answer seems to be no?

01:16:57.880 --> 01:16:59.710
So here, we have
evolved a population

01:16:59.710 --> 01:17:07.060
that not only it's not
expressing the lacZ

01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:07.700
activity here.

01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:11.970
But indeed, if you put lactose
in there, it doesn't express.

01:17:11.970 --> 01:17:16.280
So these cells can no
longer grow on lactose.

01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.544
So what's the key
difference here?

01:17:18.544 --> 01:17:19.044
Yep.

01:17:19.044 --> 01:17:21.996
AUDIENCE: So I mean, there's
no [INAUDIBLE] in this case.

01:17:21.996 --> 01:17:22.980
PROFESSOR: Right.

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:25.350
Now I think this is
just really important.

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:28.630
So in this case, there is
approximately, we'll say,

01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:35.290
no cost to having the lac operon
on there, because it's just not

01:17:35.290 --> 01:17:36.542
being expressed.

01:17:36.542 --> 01:17:38.000
So then the only
cost is associated

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.780
with DNA replication.

01:17:39.780 --> 01:17:44.410
So the advantage associated
with shutting off or removing

01:17:44.410 --> 01:17:46.660
the ability to grow on lactose
is just really minimal.

01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:53.020
And indeed, in this culture, the
authors did say, what happened.

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:57.372
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the entire
gene is diluted, right?

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah, right.

01:17:58.330 --> 01:18:01.410
So it was almost a kB was
just removed from the genome.

01:18:01.410 --> 01:18:04.510
And that kB included
the promoter.

01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:07.844
And so that it just-- yeah.

01:18:07.844 --> 01:18:10.177
So it's not going to be able
to grow on lactose anymore.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:15.310
But the key thing
is here, these cells

01:18:15.310 --> 01:18:17.400
were subject to this
5% cost associated

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:21.980
with making the lac operon,
which means that that mutant

01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:23.729
that appeared, it
had a 5% advantage,

01:18:23.729 --> 01:18:26.020
and so it was able to spread
throughout the population.

01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:37.240
Whereas, what they could see is
that the evolved lacZ activity

01:18:37.240 --> 01:18:40.790
indeed was different,
depending on how much lactose

01:18:40.790 --> 01:18:42.340
they had in the culture.

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:43.850
And this is in the
presence by IPTG,

01:18:43.850 --> 01:18:47.128
so they removed
that feedback loop.

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:56.670
And in these experiments,
anyway you slice it,

01:18:56.670 --> 01:19:03.000
the normalized lacZ activity did
not go above around 1.2 or 1.3.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.820
So there is some
non-linearity that is somehow

01:19:05.820 --> 01:19:07.810
constraining those
cells from going up

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:12.776
to increased expression very
much beyond the wild type.

01:19:18.620 --> 01:19:22.890
We are out of time,
but on Tuesday, we'll

01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:25.470
start talking about
evolution, and in particular,

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:26.970
in the context of
neutral evolution,

01:19:26.970 --> 01:19:29.570
as kind of a null model to try
to understand these dynamics.

01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:32.170
And we will also
talk more about why

01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:34.999
it takes as long as it
does before you start

01:19:34.999 --> 01:19:36.290
seeing anything happening here.

01:19:36.290 --> 01:19:39.890
If you have any questions,
please feel free to come on up.

talk with him directly?

00:00:13.292 --> 00:00:14.750
HALSEY BURGUND:
Yeah, so thank you.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.630
I was extremely
excited when I learned

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.300
that this class was happening
at all, just because I've

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.820
been doing things that I would
consider audio AR for 12 years

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.990
now, probably.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.470
I'm very old, so don't
ask me any particulars.

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.570
And it's so exciting
to be at a time

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.630
now where things are
becoming, I don't

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.760
know if I'd call it
mainstream yet, but at least

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.010
getting to the point where
people are talking about it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.210
and teaching it.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.560
And so I was excited to
learn from what you guys are

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.810
going through and
learning in this class

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.030
and to contribute to
the extent that I can.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.740
So I don't know what
just happened there,

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.100
but I'm going to
press Play again.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.745
Am I back?

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.310
I'm a sound artist
and technologist.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.690
And I've been doing
work with what

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.450
I would call audio AR for
quite a while, as I was saying.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.310
I work a lot with
spoken human voices.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.830
And the contributory
part of my work

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.940
is that I generally
do work that feeds off

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.370
of responses and commentary
that I get from people

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:21.620
who are experiencing the work.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.450
So I ask people questions.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.640
I record their answers,
or they record themselves.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.300
And then those sort of feed
back into these evolving

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.520
works that are
often location-based

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.250
and change over time and often
have a musical underpinning,

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.750
as well.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.917
So I'm going to talk about
a whole bunch of examples

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:42.680
of my work and then talk a
little bit about the technology

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.490
that I've developed to support
some of that work, which

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.420
is what I would call a
contributory audio AR framework

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.250
platform called Roundware.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.470
And then I'm hoping
there'll be plenty

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.402
of time to ask questions.

00:01:56.402 --> 00:01:57.860
Because that's
probably going to be

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:59.990
the most useful and
interesting part, perhaps.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.410
So feel free to jump in any
time if you have questions.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.400
But there will be time
at the end, either way.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.787
So let me just leap in.

00:02:06.787 --> 00:02:09.120
I don't know what order things
are going to happen here,

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.912
but I'm going to go
for it, whatever it is.

00:02:10.912 --> 00:02:12.620
OK, so what is Roundware?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.870
I just mentioned a little
bit about what Roundware is,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.030
but essentially, Roundware is
a framework, or a platform,

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:22.430
depending on your
preference there,

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.100
that basically, it
allows to overlay

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.592
any kind of physical landscape
with a layer of audio.

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:34.550
And it's actually multiple
layers of audio that

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.758
can interact with each other.

00:02:35.758 --> 00:02:37.460
And I have this
quick example here

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:41.690
of the basic elements of what a
Roundware installation covers.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.910
So let's say you wanted to do
something on the Mall in DC.

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.090
And this is the mall.

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.580
And the first thing
Roundware allows you to do

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.330
is to create regions of
what I call ambient music.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.290
Well, I don't call it--

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.998
lots of people call
things ambient music,

00:02:58.998 --> 00:03:02.510
but it's sort of a continuous
layer of ambient sound.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.160
And those, right
now, they're just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.090
circles that are drawn here.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.480
You could have any
shapes you want.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.147
And basically, the
way to think about it

00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:12.322
is each of these circles has a
different underlying ambient--

00:03:12.322 --> 00:03:14.030
it doesn't have to be
ambient but, often,

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.680
in my case, it's
ambient-- soundtrack.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.320
And as you walk from
one to the next,

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.540
one fades out, the other
one fades in, et cetera.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.770
Here, you've got all
three of them playing.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.400
So this is a way to
compose a piece of music

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.840
or a audio experience of some
sort that really is very highly

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.940
dependent on how somebody
traverses an actual terrain.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.570
So this is quite
simplified in the sense

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.178
that there are only
circles here right now.

00:03:38.178 --> 00:03:40.220
Roundware started out,
you could only do circles.

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.000
I've since moved on to polygons,
which is very exciting.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
So you can draw just a
block, or you can just

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.230
draw right around here
on a map and basically

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.730
assign any audio to that.

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:57.020
And in addition to the
underlying, continuous layer

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.440
of audio, there are
two types of what

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.910
I call momentary audio that can
be interspersed within that.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.510
They're usually smaller
bits, and they are usually

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.220
pieces of audio that play once.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.870
Like, you get into the area,
and then it's triggered.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.810
It will play once,
and then it'll

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.200
be done, as opposed to a
looping, ambient situation.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.050
And those can be either
curated by the person

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:22.220
creating the projects--

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.670
me or whomever is
using Roundware--

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.050
or they can be added--

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.280
using the same app-- they can
be added by the people who

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.700
are experiencing the project.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.970
So these red ones
are to indicate

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.670
that there's another
type of content, which

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.630
is a dynamic type of content,
which happens over time when

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.500
a particular piece is installed.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.700
So if I installed this
in DC on January 1,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.490
and the app was
released and people

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.740
could wander around
listening to everything which

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.810
was the ambient layer and
then these yellow dots,

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.910
and then they added
their own on top

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.430
of that to respond to
various questions that

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.350
are asked within the app--

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.290
and depending on what
the piece is about,

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.860
I can ask any question I want--

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.230
look at the clouds and
tell me what you think,

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.070
or tell me what this
building reminds you of,

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.235
or anything at all, describe the
person who just walked past you

00:05:17.235 --> 00:05:18.610
or something like
that, there are

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:21.640
lots of explorations that can
be done-- but the point is

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.440
that these red ones are
indicative of a co-creation

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.400
element to what I do, a
contributory element, and a way

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.900
in which I lose control over a
lot of what the piece ends up

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.390
being, which is both exciting
and totally nerve-racking,

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:38.890
as I'm sure you can imagine.

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.910
But it's a crucial
part of my work

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:45.580
and of what Roundware allows.

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:48.160
Because, again, Roundware
was developed, obviously,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.180
to scratch my own itch that
I had to create the pieces.

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.340
So I will keep on going.

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.680
I'm going to kind of
crank through some

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.680
of the history of where
Roundware came from just

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.305
relatively quickly, although I'm
going to show one video, which

00:06:05.305 --> 00:06:07.865
I think will be useful.

00:06:07.865 --> 00:06:10.240
So Roundware was actually
named because the first project

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.700
I did with it was called Round.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.400
So this was a
project for a museum

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.610
outside of New York called
The Aldrich Contemporary Art

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:19.120
Museum.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.630
And they asked me to
come in and do something

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.838
that would be slightly
resembling an audio tour

00:06:28.838 --> 00:06:29.880
but not be an audio tour.

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.280
Because they really didn't
like the general approach

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.912
of audio tours to
sort of tell you

00:06:33.912 --> 00:06:36.370
what you're supposed to think
about the artwork, et cetera,

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.870
et cetera.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.880
And I decided that
what I would do

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:42.030
was basically create a sort
of soundtrack for the museum

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.530
so when people are
wandering around,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.950
they could hear that, and
then infuse it with comments

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.690
that people made
about the artworks

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.258
in the museum that would be
heard when you were standing

00:06:51.258 --> 00:06:52.300
in front of that artwork.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.300
So you could be standing
in front of a painting,

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.160
and you could hear the curator's
remarks about the painting,

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:03.630
but then you could also hear
a six year old's comments

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:06.960
about the painting, as
well, and the idea of sort

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:11.462
of democratizing and
making art into something

00:07:11.462 --> 00:07:13.170
that I feel it should
always be, which is

00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:14.970
that anybody can appreciate it.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.560
Anybody can like or
dislike anything,

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.990
and you don't need to
have a PhD in art history

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.600
or some kind of
critical discourse

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:23.640
to have that sort
of appreciation.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:26.370
So that's where
Roundware came from.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:31.260
The title, Round,
the reason I named it

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:34.020
that, which is somewhat
useful, perhaps, to understand,

00:07:34.020 --> 00:07:38.270
is, first of all, King
Arthur's Round Table,

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.020
where everybody sits
around a round table,

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:44.440
and nobody's opinion is
more important than others,

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.277
and then, second of all, the
notion of a musical round.

00:07:47.277 --> 00:07:49.860
Do you guys know what a musical
round is, like "Row, Row, Row,

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.360
Your Boat"?

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.500
And everybody's singing together
but kind of in an offset way,

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.890
which I think is
somewhat what Roundware

00:07:55.890 --> 00:07:56.980
enables you to create.

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:00.270
So I'm going to hope
that this is actually

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.320
going to play a video.

00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:06.270
This was a piece that I did
at the deCordova Sculpture

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:09.520
Garden and Museum out in
Lincoln, outside of Boston.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.972
And it was one of the first
pieces using Roundware,

00:08:11.972 --> 00:08:13.680
and I think it will
give you a little bit

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.440
of an idea of what
Roundware can actually do

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.203
and what my work is like.

00:08:18.203 --> 00:08:18.870
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:21.702
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:24.062 --> 00:08:26.040
HALSEY BURGUND: The
Scapes piece is,

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:29.700
I think of it as a musical
composition that is a spatially

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:31.260
related musical composition.

00:08:41.559 --> 00:08:46.135
And the volumes of those
parts fade up and down,

00:08:46.135 --> 00:08:47.760
depending on how
close you are to where

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.350
the center of that
particular musical part is.

00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:53.100
- OK, let's walk.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.180
The music is changing now.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.820
Yeah, we get these bells
more towards-- the entrance

00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:07.810
of the museum is more of
a sort of melodic part

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:08.830
of our slow melody.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.565
All the music is
based on some of

00:09:10.565 --> 00:09:12.690
the topographic characteristics
of the park itself.

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:16.860
- I know that--

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.060
- Oh, there's some voices.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.750
- There's some voices.

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:21.950
- Hey, there goes a chipmunk.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.530
- --somebody--

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.955
- Right where I'm standing,
some guys saw a chipmunk.

00:09:25.955 --> 00:09:26.830
- There's a chipmunk.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.480
- There goes the chipmunk again.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.730
- Which could have been a
chipmunk from two weeks ago.

00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.900
- Yes, it could have,
absolutely, which I think

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:32.960
is kind of fun to
think about where

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.085
that chipmunk is right now.

00:09:34.085 --> 00:09:35.170
- [LAUGHS]

00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:38.914
- --is getting what I would
call ominous, a little darker.

00:09:38.914 --> 00:09:42.150
And as I'm standing
here, a huge, dark cloud

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:46.090
is rolling in over the
garden, over the trees.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.617
The light's getting darker.

00:09:47.617 --> 00:09:52.500
And I don't know how the
application [INAUDIBLE]..

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.650
- I'm standing inside
this glass sculpture.

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:56.210
And the acoustics are very fun.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:00.560
- Oh, wow.

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.870
So that guy went and did this.

00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:07.220
They stuck their head
into this open glass dome

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.720
that's part of the structure.

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:11.730
And these are the acoustics
he was talking about.

00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:14.660
And now, I'm doing it, too.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:16.603
- You might not have
done that otherwise.

00:10:16.603 --> 00:10:18.020
- I'm pretty sure
I wouldn't have.

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.960
- [LAUGHS]

00:10:26.265 --> 00:10:30.590
- In a week, they are recruiting
into the Israeli army.

00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:32.320
I'm going to be a soldier.

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.528
I'm very scared, pretty excited.

00:10:37.528 --> 00:10:40.240
Being here is pretty
peaceful, I guess,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.390
compared to what I'm
about to go through.

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:44.290
Good luck to me.

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.060
- Oh, wow.

00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:59.247
Is this rain?

00:10:59.247 --> 00:10:59.830
- That's rain.

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:01.913
- Someone must have been
here when it was raining.

00:11:01.913 --> 00:11:04.280
- And they recorded the rain
and left it here for us.

00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:05.310
- It's not raining,
though, right now.

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:05.810
- No.

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:10.710
- That's pretty cool.

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:13.460
So if you want to make
your own recording.

00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:15.080
- OK, I'm looking
at this sculpture.

00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.160
It looks like a piece of like
HVAC duct work from a building,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.440
but it kind of twists
in a way that reminds

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.420
me of a lower intestine.

00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:24.470
And we hit stop?

00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:26.900
- And hit stop, and then
we can listen to it back.

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.430
- OK, I'm looking
at this sculpture.

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:29.990
It looks like a piece of--

00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.400
- There I am.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.642
- --like HVAC duct work.

00:11:32.642 --> 00:11:34.100
- There are at
least three elements

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:35.720
going on simultaneously.

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.010
There is the music.

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:39.740
There was the rain from god
knows when that was recorded,

00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:41.510
not on a day like today.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:43.620
And then, there's me.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.870
- From just a few minutes ago.

00:11:58.154 --> 00:12:01.830
- It looks like a
very peaceful garden.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:05.810
The thing I think would
help it would be a few--

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:10.130
would be a few of one of those
type of fish that are catfish.

00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:17.580
[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:20.400
HALSEY BURGUND: So
that should give you

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.120
a little bit of an idea.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.720
So that piece started out
with just the music and none

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.470
of the comments.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:27.970
And then, people made
the comments over time,

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:30.990
which, again, that's the other
sort of nerve-racking part

00:12:30.990 --> 00:12:33.242
of this is when you start
and the music is written

00:12:33.242 --> 00:12:35.700
to have comments on top of it,
so it's not that interesting

00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:37.380
until commentary comes in.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.040
But you hope for the
best and hope that you

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.950
get kids who like catfish.

00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:44.563
I don't know.

00:12:44.563 --> 00:12:46.980
"It's a type of fish that are
catfish" is very interesting

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:47.480
phrasing.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:51.215
But super cute, though.

00:12:51.215 --> 00:12:52.590
So that gives you
the basic idea,

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:57.000
I think, hopefully, with the
retro iPhone and everything.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.280
So I'll go through--

00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:02.460
actually, I'm going to skip
some of these things real quick

00:13:02.460 --> 00:13:03.450
here.

00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:05.430
That's not, that's
not, that's not--

00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:07.650
OK, another audio
ARP, Sound Sky.

00:13:07.650 --> 00:13:09.885
This was a piece I did in
Christchurch, New Zealand.

00:13:13.498 --> 00:13:15.540
A number of years ago,
they had a huge earthquake

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.570
in Christchurch, which
pretty much destroyed

00:13:18.570 --> 00:13:20.290
a huge portion of the downtown.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.830
So the sort of hope
with this piece

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:25.590
was to create a piece
in the downtown area

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:31.740
and let people who are residents
go wander through and, in part,

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.470
reminisce about what used to
exist in certain places that

00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:38.280
were, unfortunately,
destroyed but then also look

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:42.690
to the future and sort of talk
about, well, this was this,

00:13:42.690 --> 00:13:44.820
but now we have an
opportunity to rebuild,

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.640
and this could become this, and
the downtown could transform

00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.798
into this new sort of thing.

00:13:49.798 --> 00:13:51.840
So the idea of having a
location-based piece that

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.637
allowed people to
make these comments,

00:13:53.637 --> 00:13:55.470
to actually create the
comments when they're

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:59.938
in the emotional space of being
there, was extremely important.

00:13:59.938 --> 00:14:01.980
Because I think that really
puts you in the right

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.190
place to make heartfelt,
earnest, authentic comments.

00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:08.243
And then, also, obviously,
when other people come by

00:14:08.243 --> 00:14:10.410
to listen to those comments,
they exist in the place

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:12.000
where the person made them.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.810
So there's this connection
to the specific landscape,

00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:20.640
to that specific location, on
both ends of that experience,

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.580
which I think is one of the ways
that audio AR can be really,

00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:27.480
really compelling-- certainly
not the only but one

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.800
of the great ways that you
can navigate through a space,

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:34.980
listening to something,
and not having your phone

00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.920
in front of you the
whole time, and get

00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.150
that added layer of content.

00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:42.030
So another project,
Tributaries, this

00:14:42.030 --> 00:14:44.860
was a project in
Newcastle in the UK,

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:53.520
which was done for the 100th
anniversary of World War I--

00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.085
the end of-- well, the entire--

00:14:58.085 --> 00:14:59.460
a bunch of the
museums over there

00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:02.160
were doing a bunch of
exhibitions on World War I.

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:05.220
And they wanted to try to bring
back some voices from back then

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:07.860
and bring back some
of the experiences

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:10.260
that people who were
alive then went through.

00:15:10.260 --> 00:15:11.880
Obviously, there's
not many recordings

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.790
from back then, so we had
to reproduce some of that.

00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:17.670
But they did have a lot
of text, a lot of diaries,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.030
a lot of other--

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:21.280
there were weather reports
and all that kind of stuff.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.697
So there were ways
that we could--

00:15:22.697 --> 00:15:26.970
we got a present-day
weatherperson

00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:30.030
to voice the weather
reports from a hundred years

00:15:30.030 --> 00:15:32.790
ago and distribute those
throughout the city

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.980
and kind of create
this connection

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:38.640
between this historical
moment and the present day.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:41.070
And I think, again,
I think audio,

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:44.340
and audio AR, in
particular, I think

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.525
can be very effective at
compressing time, if you will,

00:15:47.525 --> 00:15:49.150
or connecting different
points in time,

00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:50.567
whether it's
yesterday and today--

00:15:50.567 --> 00:15:52.590
I experienced something
in this location now,

00:15:52.590 --> 00:15:55.080
and somebody will have a new
experience in this location

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:58.200
tomorrow, and there's sort
of a constancy of location--

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.950
but a breadth of time, I think,
can be quite interesting.

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:05.820
And whether it's a day, a week,
a month, or a hundred years,

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.450
I think there's a lot of
ways of jumping into that

00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:11.070
and doing some exploring.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:12.990
So Tributaries,
that was probably

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:15.240
the biggest aspect
of that project that

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.830
was new and different for me.

00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.410
So now, I'll get a little
into behind-the-scenes stuff--

00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:23.910
not too much.

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.490
So as I mentioned
before, Roundware

00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:30.560
is a software platform.

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:31.345
It is open source.

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:37.020
I'm not going to get really,
hardly at all, technical.

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.925
So I'm sure you guys are--

00:16:38.925 --> 00:16:40.800
but feel free to ask
more technical questions

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:41.508
if you have them.

00:16:41.508 --> 00:16:44.452
But Roundware, essentially,
is a client server.

00:16:44.452 --> 00:16:45.660
The server sits in the cloud.

00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:47.910
All the audio is
stored up there,

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:49.380
database, all that
kind of stuff.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.720
And then there are
various clients

00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.900
that can talk to that server
via the Roundware API.

00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:58.085
This is a somewhat
old diagram, so

00:16:58.085 --> 00:17:00.210
forgive some of the stuff
that's a little outdated.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.510
But essentially, just
what I said-- database,

00:17:03.510 --> 00:17:08.609
some software on the server that
used to do the audio mixing.

00:17:08.609 --> 00:17:11.790
The audio mixing is now
moved to the clients.

00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:15.839
But the basic point is that
there's a database of audio

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:17.310
that is all geotagged.

00:17:17.310 --> 00:17:21.270
And the clients access that
data with the knowledge,

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.650
of course, of
where the client is

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.710
at any given time, how
the client's moving,

00:17:25.710 --> 00:17:26.849
all of that information.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:31.080
And that enables the generation
of a dynamic stream of audio

00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:33.660
that is unique for
any individual.

00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:37.890
Any client will have a
unique stream of audio,

00:17:37.890 --> 00:17:40.800
whether it's coming
from the client

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.030
or being generated locally.

00:17:42.030 --> 00:17:44.430
And it all depends on how
they're walking around,

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.920
how fast they're going,
in some cases, what

00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.990
direction they're looking.

00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:54.120
I know you guys are fully
aware of all the Bose stuff,

00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.800
the frames and whatnot.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:59.745
So that's a sort of
high-level architecture.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:02.573
This is way more than I
want to actually go through.

00:18:02.573 --> 00:18:04.990
As I mentioned, the mixing is
now done on the client side.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:07.680
So just the component
parts of the audio stream

00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:08.370
are downloaded.

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:10.162
And then, the client
does the mixing, which

00:18:10.162 --> 00:18:14.700
allows me to do less
latent activities,

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.862
such as when you look in
a different direction,

00:18:17.862 --> 00:18:20.070
you don't want to have to
wait for the buffering time

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.240
to have your audio actually
change accordingly.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.020
So client-side mixing
makes a lot more sense

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:27.780
and is something
that we've moved to.

00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.190
The iOS framework
has moved to that,

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.440
as has the web app framework.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:36.930
Android is a little behind--

00:18:36.930 --> 00:18:38.640
budgetary problems.

00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.340
You know how it is,
open-source projects.

00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:44.160
When I get an
enthusiastic Roundware

00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:50.070
developer to participate, then
that will catch up, I think.

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:53.650
But yeah, so frameworks for iOS,
you can put it into any iOS app

00:18:53.650 --> 00:18:54.150
you want.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:56.340
And it basically just
implements the Roundware API,

00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.640
allows for the generation
of these streams

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.840
and the communication
with the server.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:06.030
This is a diagram
of the playlist.

00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:09.270
So essentially,
at any given time,

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:12.630
there's a dynamic playlist
that Roundware generates,

00:19:12.630 --> 00:19:16.620
which determines
what of those assets

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.970
will play back for the person.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.290
And the assets are, if you
remember the diagram before,

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:22.507
the small dots.

00:19:22.507 --> 00:19:24.840
You could be in a spot where
there are a hundred assets.

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:26.670
You don't want to hear them all
at the same time, obviously.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:28.253
You want to have
some kind of capacity

00:19:28.253 --> 00:19:30.750
for filtering and whatnot.

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:34.500
So here's just a high-level
view of the filtering

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.250
that's possible.

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.230
You have all the
assets on the top

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:40.020
and then, for a
particular project,

00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:41.820
then you can filter
them by tags.

00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:44.340
Basically, it's very
simple metadata kind

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.060
of tags that are
grouped by categories.

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.250
Which question are
you responding to?

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:55.305
Are you an adult or a child,
if you care about that?

00:19:55.305 --> 00:19:56.430
What's your favorite color?

00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:58.670
I mean, it could be anything.

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.420
And then, there are
location-based filters

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.290
based on where you're
located, based on whether you

00:20:04.290 --> 00:20:07.500
heard the asset recently.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.828
And if it's been
blocked for some reason,

00:20:09.828 --> 00:20:12.120
then there's ordering and
prioritization, all that kind

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:12.620
of stuff.

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.940
So again, I don't want
to go into huge detail

00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.680
because we don't
have a ton of time.

00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:19.418
But it's important,
obviously, to be

00:20:19.418 --> 00:20:21.210
able to filter content
to be able to create

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.793
the kind of experiences
that you want.

00:20:22.793 --> 00:20:25.680
And some of this content
filtering is automatic,

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.960
and others can be exposed to
the user based on what you want.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:36.520
So in some cases, I might
want people to be able to say,

00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:40.230
I want to hear only comments
that museum visitors have made

00:20:40.230 --> 00:20:42.270
versus curatorial comments.

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.100
In other cases, I
might want to enforce

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.600
that those are mixed
with each other

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.300
to make some kind of
point, for example.

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:52.650
So here's a few other types.

00:20:52.650 --> 00:20:55.830
These are kind of different
listening modes, if you will,

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.630
that Roundware supports.

00:20:57.630 --> 00:21:00.420
The traditional
mode is when you're

00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:03.150
within the range of
a particular asset,

00:21:03.150 --> 00:21:04.590
it becomes part of the playlist.

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.720
So right here, these
three are in range.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.450
They're either circles, or you
can have a polygon for assets,

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:10.320
as well.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:11.570
That's pretty straightforward.

00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:14.190
Whatever you're close
to, you can hear.

00:21:14.190 --> 00:21:16.290
The global listen just
makes everything available,

00:21:16.290 --> 00:21:17.290
no matter where you are.

00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.920
That can be very
effective at times

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.750
for certain types of projects.

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:24.450
Or at certain times within
the experience of a project,

00:21:24.450 --> 00:21:26.310
you could switch to
global mode and then

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.990
switch back, if you wanted.

00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:32.160
Range listening allows
for you to create

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.990
some different
approaches of listening

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:38.180
to stuff that's at different
distances from you.

00:21:38.180 --> 00:21:40.790
So there's a minimum
and a maximum distance.

00:21:40.790 --> 00:21:43.220
I've done some experimentation
with-- lift your phone up

00:21:43.220 --> 00:21:46.820
and it lets you listen to stuff
that's farther away from you.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.220
And you point it downwards,
it brings the stuff closer.

00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:52.377
So again, that's a way that
you can determine what content

00:21:52.377 --> 00:21:53.210
you're listening to.

00:21:53.210 --> 00:21:56.120
And that's useful if
you create projects

00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:57.620
that don't have
content everywhere,

00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.578
and you want people to
still be able to listen.

00:21:59.578 --> 00:22:01.758
They can just
expand their range.

00:22:01.758 --> 00:22:03.050
And then directional listening.

00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:05.630
Again, this is
what Bose Frames do

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:07.220
but also the IMU
on your phone does.

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.580
So if you take your phone when
you're listening to the app

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.600
and you just move it around, you
can give yourself a certain arc

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.880
and listen to the content.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.533
In this case, these three
guys would be available.

00:22:19.533 --> 00:22:21.200
You can combine these
in different ways.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.420
You can use the distance--
minimum and maximum distance--

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:24.140
with the range.

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:28.440
You can combine these sort of
approaches in different ways.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.570
So I'm not going to demo the
web admin because I don't

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:33.810
think that's very exciting.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.340
But I'm happy to answer
questions about that.

00:22:37.340 --> 00:22:41.130
And we're coming
up on 4:30 here,

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:45.530
so I thought it would probably
be better for you guys

00:22:45.530 --> 00:22:50.090
to have me stop blabbing
a lot and perhaps dive

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:52.730
into what is most interesting
to you guys-- hopefully,

00:22:52.730 --> 00:22:54.200
something.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:55.920
And we can go from there.

00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:56.953
Is that cool?

00:22:56.953 --> 00:22:58.120
Does that work for you guys?

00:22:58.120 --> 00:22:59.947
I can certainly talk
about more projects,

00:22:59.947 --> 00:23:02.030
but I'd love to hear what
questions you guys have.

00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:08.890
And I can certainly demonstrate
stuff, as well if you want.

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:10.790
Questions?

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.913
Comments?

00:23:12.913 --> 00:23:14.080
There's got to be something.

00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:16.020
There's got to be.

00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.720
AUDIENCE: One of
our first game ideas

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.180
that we haven't
ended up pursuing

00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.128
was actually Gwen's idea,
but was this murder mystery,

00:23:27.128 --> 00:23:28.920
where you have to go
to different locations

00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.330
to get different clues,
to hear different clues.

00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:37.290
The idea was you'd
go back in time

00:23:37.290 --> 00:23:39.420
and hear something
relevant to whatever case

00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.713
you're trying to solve
and that sort of thing.

00:23:41.713 --> 00:23:43.380
HALSEY BURGUND: Yeah,
that's super cool.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.460
AUDIENCE: That sounds like it
would be an application of--

00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:47.460
HALSEY BURGUND: Totally.

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.000
Yeah, no, I love that idea.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.882
I think the time
traveling thing,

00:23:51.882 --> 00:23:53.340
as I was mentioning
before, I think

00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.780
that can be really helpful.

00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:57.120
You can create soundscape.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.210
You could have a horse and
buggy driving by-- whatever.

00:24:00.210 --> 00:24:02.290
You could have
period-type sounds

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:04.290
going if you wanted to
really make somebody feel

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:05.764
like they've gone back in time.

00:24:05.764 --> 00:24:07.806
AUDIENCE: We could
personalize that for each user

00:24:07.806 --> 00:24:13.020
so each user could be doing a
different story or something.

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:13.980
HALSEY BURGUND: Yes.

00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:15.930
That would probably
be a set of tags.

00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:18.138
You would assign different
tags to different stories.

00:24:18.138 --> 00:24:19.980
You could have story
A, story B, story C,

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:21.918
and people would choose,
or could be assigned,

00:24:21.918 --> 00:24:22.710
one of those three.

00:24:22.710 --> 00:24:24.377
And then, that would
segment the content

00:24:24.377 --> 00:24:26.850
based on what they wanted.

00:24:26.850 --> 00:24:29.850
But yes, going to a
particular location,

00:24:29.850 --> 00:24:32.940
gathering more
information or something

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:36.300
like that for the murder
mystery is definitely something

00:24:36.300 --> 00:24:38.550
that Roundware could do.

00:24:38.550 --> 00:24:40.195
It's actually funny.

00:24:40.195 --> 00:24:42.070
Actually, that Scapes
piece, the Scapes piece

00:24:42.070 --> 00:24:46.140
that I showed the
video of, people

00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:49.350
started making up their
own games with it.

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:51.678
And one person did kind
of what you're saying.

00:24:51.678 --> 00:24:53.470
It wasn't a murder
mystery, by any stretch,

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:56.760
but they went to a
random place and said,

00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.668
go to the corner
of the parking lot

00:24:59.668 --> 00:25:01.960
to receive further instructions
or something like that.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:04.350
And then, they went over
there, and then they

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.440
proceeded to talk about
the further instruction.

00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:12.310
And it was kind of a game
within the piece, which I didn't

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:13.560
have anything to do with that.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:18.410
It was somebody taking their own
initiative to figure that out,

00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:19.872
which I thought was great.

00:25:19.872 --> 00:25:22.080
A whole bunch of kids talked
about zombies and stuff.

00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.632
They were like, I'm hiding
beneath this sculpture.

00:25:24.632 --> 00:25:25.590
The zombies are coming.

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:32.790
And then this story of zombies
actually continued over months,

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:34.050
with different people.

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:37.318
All the zombie fans
kind of came together.

00:25:37.318 --> 00:25:39.360
And there was this one
area of the sculpture park

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.447
that kind of turned
into zombie land.

00:25:41.447 --> 00:25:43.530
And then, at the end,
you'll be very glad to know,

00:25:43.530 --> 00:25:46.680
the helicopters came and
landed, and everybody was saved.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.640
So nobody died.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:51.307
But obviously, the zombies are--

00:25:51.307 --> 00:25:52.640
AUDIENCE: They're never leaving.

00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:54.170
HALSEY BURGUND: I don't
know what they are.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.503
I'm not going to make a comment.

00:25:55.503 --> 00:25:57.950
I'm not going to come down
on one side of that argument.

00:25:57.950 --> 00:25:59.840
But it's just one
of those things

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:03.050
where, when you
open up your work

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:07.820
to this kind of potential
interaction with it,

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.930
you sometimes get really,
really neat takes on it.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:15.920
I mean, I certainly
didn't think to create

00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:19.310
some kind of zombie scenario.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.120
But it's wonderful.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.650
And it adds-- to me, it
adds to the excitement

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:27.770
of creating these pieces.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.770
My work is very, I
guess, maybe it's

00:26:30.770 --> 00:26:33.890
a fear of ever having
something be done.

00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:36.800
But there's something
about knowing

00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.340
that things can be
sent out into the world

00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:43.280
and kind of take
on their own life,

00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:45.470
if you will, much
like a zombie--

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:46.130
no--

00:26:46.130 --> 00:26:47.870
AUDIENCE: [LAUGHS]

00:26:47.870 --> 00:26:51.290
HALSEY BURGUND: --and get this
level of creativity or level

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.420
of input that I
couldn't do on my own.

00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.000
I really get tons of
inspiration from people

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.305
who come in and do stuff.

00:26:58.305 --> 00:26:59.930
So yeah, I think that
idea is certainly

00:26:59.930 --> 00:27:04.100
one that would be
well-suited for Roundware.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.270
I have dreams of Roundware
becoming a SaaS at some point.

00:27:08.270 --> 00:27:09.050
It is not yet.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:14.693
It requires a little more
technical involvement

00:27:14.693 --> 00:27:16.860
to set up the server and
then get the client talking

00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.090
to the server.

00:27:18.090 --> 00:27:19.150
All the code is there.

00:27:19.150 --> 00:27:23.760
It's just a matter of
going through those steps.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.230
There's a demo
Roundware app that

00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:28.920
can be used for testing
stuff, which is pretty handy.

00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.740
If you just want to go
out and make recordings

00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:34.560
in certain locations and
then see how it works,

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:36.960
that can be done.

00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.540
The iOS version is a
good place to do that.

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.945
But I think that idea
would definitely be--

00:27:43.945 --> 00:27:45.570
Roundware could
certainly help at least

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.048
get the basics going on that.

00:27:48.048 --> 00:27:48.840
AUDIENCE: Question.

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:50.063
HALSEY BURGUND: Yes?

00:27:50.063 --> 00:27:52.230
AUDIENCE: You showed a
little bit of the Scapes user

00:27:52.230 --> 00:27:54.328
interface for the
end user, where

00:27:54.328 --> 00:27:56.370
they can record it and
just pretty much just drop

00:27:56.370 --> 00:27:59.610
a sound that has some radius.

00:27:59.610 --> 00:28:01.950
But then, you also showed
all this other capacity

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:05.250
of direction and like
minimum and maximum radius.

00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:08.850
How much of that
do you see being

00:28:08.850 --> 00:28:16.800
useful to expose to the most
typical part of the project,

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.820
right, and how much of it
is just too complex, I mean,

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.890
is off-putting?

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.860
HALSEY BURGUND: Yeah, to date,
I've exposed very little of it.

00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:27.670
And that's a really
good question.

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.600
It is something I think
a lot about because I do

00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:34.090
want it to remain
simple for the end user.

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:35.430
That's why there's two buttons.

00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:36.420
It's Listen or Speak.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.015
And obviously, within
Speak, there's a few steps

00:28:40.015 --> 00:28:40.890
that you need to do--

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:43.057
what question do you want
to respond to and whatnot.

00:28:43.057 --> 00:28:46.140
But it's fairly
straightforward in that regard.

00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:50.885
And exposing more does cause
some problems sometimes.

00:28:50.885 --> 00:28:52.260
So I've experimented
a little bit

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:55.830
with adding additional
filtering capacity

00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:58.890
but having it semi-hidden--
not really hidden,

00:28:58.890 --> 00:29:01.950
but it's behind a button.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:02.712
You hit a button.

00:29:02.712 --> 00:29:04.920
Then you open up, oh, here
are some filters I can do.

00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.460
And the filters have
a default state,

00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.127
which is basically
listen to everything.

00:29:08.127 --> 00:29:09.995
And then you can
specify from there

00:29:09.995 --> 00:29:12.870
and become a super-user
of sorts, if you want.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:14.970
AUDIENCE: So this a user
choosing their listening

00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:18.000
experience based on
eliminating things

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.410
that they don't want to hear.

00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:21.035
HALSEY BURGUND: In
this case, yes, yes.

00:29:21.035 --> 00:29:22.627
I like to start
with the broad set.

00:29:22.627 --> 00:29:24.210
If you start with
nothing, then people

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:27.510
are going to get confused, so
kind of starting broad and then

00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:28.830
narrowing down.

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.860
As far as the other listening
modes and everything goes,

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:37.290
that's more of a
set up the project

00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:38.760
that way, one way or the other.

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.010
And if you're
seeding the project

00:29:41.010 --> 00:29:42.900
with a certain
amount of content--

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:45.360
like the Scapes piece was seeded
with basically no content.

00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.030
I allowed people to come in
and do whatever they wanted.

00:29:48.030 --> 00:29:51.150
The Tributaries piece, I
created a lot of content myself,

00:29:51.150 --> 00:29:53.310
and I put it out there--

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:59.730
the weather reports and diary
entries and machinist's shop

00:29:59.730 --> 00:30:02.070
logs, stuff like that that
was historical material.

00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:03.150
I could create that,
and then I could

00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:05.525
place that where I wanted,
and I could create the shapes.

00:30:05.525 --> 00:30:09.030
And I could do
anything like that.

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:13.910
Actually, the scenario in
which I think exposing more

00:30:13.910 --> 00:30:16.970
to an end user that
would be most appropriate

00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:19.580
would be something
that I'm working

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:25.790
on now, which is
enabling the app

00:30:25.790 --> 00:30:28.400
to be a different
type of creation tool.

00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.200
So the person creating
the experience

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:35.120
would be able to go and
say Create a Recording

00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.760
and then walk around
a closed polygon

00:30:37.760 --> 00:30:40.940
that they want that recording
to exist in, for example,

00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.105
and do other manipulations--
be able to move stuff around,

00:30:45.105 --> 00:30:45.980
to be able to adjust.

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.022
So you're really in the
actual physical location

00:30:48.022 --> 00:30:49.730
that the piece is
going to be experienced

00:30:49.730 --> 00:30:50.730
when you're creating it.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:54.950
Because I think that's a far cry
from sitting at your computer

00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:56.720
at a Google map and
drawing something.

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.640
Like, I think this is where it
is, but I'm not really sure,

00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.910
and I don't really know
if this is going to work.

00:30:59.910 --> 00:31:00.535
So you do that.

00:31:00.535 --> 00:31:02.900
I always find myself doing
that and then going out

00:31:02.900 --> 00:31:04.800
and listening and
then going back in.

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:08.050
And this back and forth
can be very frustrating.

00:31:08.050 --> 00:31:11.962
So I think the exposure
of more in-depth

00:31:11.962 --> 00:31:14.420
I don't know if you want to
call them editing tools or just

00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:19.040
experience-modifying
tools, i think

00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.800
makes more sense for more
the creator's side of things.

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.410
Of course, end
users are creators,

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:27.140
to a certain extent because
they have the option

00:31:27.140 --> 00:31:29.128
of adding their own content.

00:31:29.128 --> 00:31:30.170
But it's a good question.

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:31.580
Because I think it's
a constant balance.

00:31:31.580 --> 00:31:33.205
And maybe when people
get more familiar

00:31:33.205 --> 00:31:35.870
with the overall
idea of audio AR,

00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:38.480
then we'll be able to
push a little farther

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.230
in that direction.

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:44.540
But right now, my experience
has been that people,

00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.060
when explaining it to them, it
was wonderful when Pokémon GO

00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:47.900
came out for me.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:50.300
Because even though this
really isn't Pokémon GO,

00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:53.540
there is an element of,
hey, it's like Pokémon GO,

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:56.590
except instead of finding
Pokémon, you're going around,

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.340
and you're finding
little pieces of audio.

00:31:58.340 --> 00:31:59.720
And those are playing.

00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:01.580
AUDIENCE: And you
can put some down.

00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:03.247
HALSEY BURGUND: And
you can add-- right.

00:32:03.247 --> 00:32:06.020
Pokémon, you can't spawn
your own Pokémon, really,

00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.550
at this point.

00:32:07.550 --> 00:32:09.170
But that was a nice
thing to give me

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:11.660
a context within which
to talk about this stuff,

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:13.940
despite the obvious differences.

00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:16.910
But perhaps, when AR
generally and maybe audio AR

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:18.860
gets to the point where
everybody understands

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:22.040
that it exists and there are
possibilities on a base level,

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.740
then we'll be able to
push things farther.

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:27.560
But yeah, I think there's a ton
of stuff with the directional.

00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:33.050
And that's why the Bose
IMU-enabled headphones

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:36.500
or frames-- and I know that
there are other manufacturers

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:39.600
doing stuff, as well.

00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.470
And I think that's going to
be really exciting, for sure.

00:32:42.470 --> 00:32:46.910
Or AirPods, I think they've
got IMUs or some semi-IMU.

00:32:46.910 --> 00:32:48.380
The new AirPod Pros
have something.

00:32:48.380 --> 00:32:49.860
They certainly have an
accelerometer in them.

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:50.750
So I don't know.

00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:51.310
AUDIENCE: Well,
yeah, that's right.

00:32:51.310 --> 00:32:52.100
Because you can tap them.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.180
HALSEY BURGUND: Yeah,
because you could tap them.

00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.242
And I don't know
what kind of APIs

00:32:55.242 --> 00:32:56.450
are going to open up on that.

00:32:56.450 --> 00:33:00.800
But it seems like people are
thinking about that stuff--

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.632
wearables, hearables.

00:33:02.632 --> 00:33:04.340
I don't know if I'm
too into that phrase,

00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:08.300
but it seems to be what
people are using somewhat now.

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.860
But yeah, for me,
the more hardware

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:11.960
that companies put out
that I can experiment with,

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:12.460
the better.

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:16.170
It's great because I certainly
can't build hardware.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.980
I tried strapping an IMU to my--

00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:22.500
it was a major failure.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.050
But I'm not really
a hardware guy.

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:29.000
So more questions,
more comments,

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.340
more things you would
like me to show?

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.840
I can go to--

00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:38.330
AUDIENCE: Just a take question.

00:33:38.330 --> 00:33:44.750
What is the precision
where you delineate

00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:47.720
where the song will play?

00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.680
How exact is it?

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:53.392
HALSEY BURGUND: Well, Roundware
is what I would call location--

00:33:57.050 --> 00:34:00.470
it's agnostic to where it gets
its location information from.

00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:04.340
So you note I showed you
mainly outdoor projects.

00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:07.640
Because we all know the
problems with GPS indoors.

00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:14.090
We also know that GPS is the
only ubiquitous free location

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:17.000
technology that
exists right now.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.420
So we have GPS error bars right
now, which, inside a building,

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.820
are way too big
to make it useful.

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.320
I have done a lot
of experimentation

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.100
with other interior
systems, whether they

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.449
be beacon-based or
magnetic field-based

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:34.409
or visual positioning systems.

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:37.447
But at the end of the
day, at this point,

00:34:37.447 --> 00:34:38.989
Roundware just takes
two coordinates.

00:34:38.989 --> 00:34:42.020
Roundware doesn't have
a z-axis at this point.

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:45.050
But adding that
isn't a huge leap.

00:34:45.050 --> 00:34:46.520
But I haven't
bothered to add it.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.270
There's no point until
I can get something

00:34:48.270 --> 00:34:50.949
that actually gives me useful z
data to actually base something

00:34:50.949 --> 00:34:51.449
off.

00:34:51.449 --> 00:34:53.165
But it would be super cool if--

00:34:53.165 --> 00:34:55.610
you get UWB systems,
which are like--

00:34:55.610 --> 00:34:56.570
AUDIENCE: What's that?

00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:58.940
HALSEY BURGUND: Ultra wideband.

00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.375
You can get millimeter-level.

00:35:00.375 --> 00:35:02.000
And then you could
raise your phone up,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.500
and you could stand up and sit
down and get whole new levels

00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.750
of ambient sound.

00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:07.370
I mean, it could
be totally amazing.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.010
But unfortunately,
Roundware depends

00:35:10.010 --> 00:35:12.860
on the systems that are built by
large companies and governments

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.350
that I don't have
any control over.

00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:19.730
AUDIENCE: But your experience
with implementing this museum

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:29.210
park walk, or art exhibit,
did it feel like it connected

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:35.060
spatially and conceptually.

00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.660
It felt very connected
in the demo of,

00:35:38.660 --> 00:35:42.650
oh, he must have been talking
about this particular thing.

00:35:42.650 --> 00:35:47.180
But was that the experience when
you implemented it, as well,

00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:51.020
that, yeah, people
really can see what

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.580
object they're talking about?

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:57.070
Or does it sort of pop up in
the wrong place sometimes?

00:35:57.070 --> 00:36:00.630
HALSEY BURGUND: It would be
unfair of me to say that it was

00:36:00.630 --> 00:36:02.490
always fine because
it certainly wasn't.

00:36:02.490 --> 00:36:04.020
Sometimes GPS gets wacky.

00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:05.490
And, of course,
the error bars get

00:36:05.490 --> 00:36:07.350
multiplied because
you make a recording,

00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:08.830
and there's an error bar
associated with that.

00:36:08.830 --> 00:36:10.000
And then, you're listening
to the recording,

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.040
there's another
error bar associated.

00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:12.415
Sometimes those
can destructively

00:36:12.415 --> 00:36:14.790
interact, which is
great, other times not.

00:36:14.790 --> 00:36:17.520
So certainly, there are times
when weird stuff happens.

00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:21.000
I think, generally, I
was pretty aware of what

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.480
the error bars were when I
was creating the experience.

00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:31.230
So I could set things up to a
certain extent understanding

00:36:31.230 --> 00:36:32.940
that and guiding
the experience such

00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.455
that it would work
relatively well with that.

00:36:35.455 --> 00:36:37.080
But I will also say
that, as an artist,

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:38.430
I have it a little bit easier.

00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:41.728
Because people are a
little more willing,

00:36:41.728 --> 00:36:43.770
with aesthetic experiences,
a little more willing

00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:46.247
to be forgiving about
stuff like that.

00:36:46.247 --> 00:36:48.330
So if you're talking about
something that is maybe

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:50.310
over there, you'd be
like, oh, well, the artist

00:36:50.310 --> 00:36:52.320
wanted me to walk over there.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:56.430
I mean, if you're in a generous
kind of interpretive mode,

00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.780
that can work.

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:02.442
I will say that, a lot of
times, little GPS hiccups

00:37:02.442 --> 00:37:03.900
can actually be
really interesting.

00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:09.340
Because if you're walking
by and somebody's like--

00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:11.090
this happened to me
in the Scapes project,

00:37:11.090 --> 00:37:12.423
just to use that as an example--

00:37:12.423 --> 00:37:14.420
I was walking by, and
somebody was like,

00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.280
I'm standing inside
this ring of trees,

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:17.840
and I'm looking up
towards the sky.

00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.540
And it reminds me of
my grandfather's house

00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:23.540
up in Maine, where I had
this similar situation.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.920
I was like, I'm not in A
ring of trees right now.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.378
I'm just walking
out in this field.

00:37:26.378 --> 00:37:27.800
So it made me look around.

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:30.885
And I was like, oh,
30 feet that direction

00:37:30.885 --> 00:37:33.260
was, in fact, something that
looked like a ring of trees.

00:37:33.260 --> 00:37:35.323
And it got me to go into it.

00:37:35.323 --> 00:37:37.490
So I think there is something
really nice about sort

00:37:37.490 --> 00:37:41.920
of this audio AR generally
being able to kind of pull you

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.560
in different directions
or guide you or encourage

00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.990
or whatever words
you want but to get

00:37:46.990 --> 00:37:52.385
you to explore a little more
by giving you information that

00:37:52.385 --> 00:37:54.760
is pertinent to a spot when
you're not quite at that spot

00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:56.020
yet, for example.

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:59.463
And I know that might seem
like an excuse for GPS errors.

00:37:59.463 --> 00:38:00.130
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:00.730
Yeah, I can see that.

00:38:00.730 --> 00:38:02.730
HALSEY BURGUND: But
sometimes, they can be nice.

00:38:02.730 --> 00:38:06.760
Of course, sometimes they
can be inappropriate and bad.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:12.520
But you've got to open yourself
up to the goods and the bads.

00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:16.240
But yeah, I'm just super
excited for the day when

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:21.670
interior positioning is accurate
enough to really do something

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:25.750
where you can place
sound objects,

00:38:25.750 --> 00:38:30.190
walk around them, and have
them feel like they've

00:38:30.190 --> 00:38:36.430
been spatialized and really
get a much more true-to-reality

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:37.240
kind of experience.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.620
But you guys probably
know more about

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:41.550
how close we are
to that than I do.

00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:45.780
But from where I sit,
exciting stuff is happening.

00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:47.510
But it's still--

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:50.060
I mean, the big guys are
all working on it, right?

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.780
Spatial computing, everybody
wants their spatial engine.

00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:57.350
And Amazon is doing their
thing, and Niantic, of course,

00:38:57.350 --> 00:38:58.640
is well into it.

00:38:58.640 --> 00:39:00.200
Magic Leap has
got the whatever--

00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.857
I don't know all
the-- the magic verse.

00:39:01.857 --> 00:39:02.940
Is that what they call it?

00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:04.670
AUDIENCE: I never know what
Magic Leap [INAUDIBLE]..

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:04.970
HALSEY BURGUND:
(LAUGHING) Neither

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:06.950
do I. Neither do I. But
it seems like they're

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:08.150
spending a lot of
money, and they

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.330
got good people doing stuff.

00:39:09.330 --> 00:39:10.250
AUDIENCE: They certainly
are spending a lot of money.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:10.970
HALSEY BURGUND: Yes.

00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:12.512
They got Neil
Stephenson doing stuff.

00:39:12.512 --> 00:39:16.750
So they got some
content possibilities.

00:39:16.750 --> 00:39:17.600
So yeah.

00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:19.550
I mean, it's super exciting.

00:39:19.550 --> 00:39:22.580
But we're definitely
dependent on the systems

00:39:22.580 --> 00:39:28.410
that are out of my control,
out of most people's control.

00:39:28.410 --> 00:39:31.100
But I think if you work
within those constraints,

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:34.437
you can still create
some pretty cool stuff.

00:39:34.437 --> 00:39:35.520
AUDIENCE: Other questions?

00:39:35.520 --> 00:39:36.853
HALSEY BURGUND: Other questions?

00:39:36.853 --> 00:39:38.196
Yes?

00:39:38.196 --> 00:39:39.840
AUDIENCE: In my
project, I wanted

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:42.780
to make something that people
could potentially contribute

00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.120
poetry to a location.

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:49.050
So I think this might be
really helpful with that.

00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:50.490
AUDIENCE: Yeah, yeah.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:51.540
That's very cool.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:59.080
Yeah, I think poetry can have
some wonderful, obviously,

00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:04.198
a lot of the language can be
very physically put in a place.

00:40:04.198 --> 00:40:06.490
And it would be nice to
actually be in that place, too.

00:40:06.490 --> 00:40:07.690
Yeah, I did a piece.

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:12.910
It's no longer available because
of the inexorable progress

00:40:12.910 --> 00:40:14.800
of new iOS versions and whatnot.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.560
But I did a piece
in Harvard Yard

00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:25.030
that, as the source material,
it used a bunch of audio

00:40:25.030 --> 00:40:28.000
that the Woodberry Poetry
Room at Harvard had.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.990
They've had a poetry series
for, like, a hundred years

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:34.250
of poets coming in and
reading their works.

00:40:34.250 --> 00:40:37.450
So they had recordings of
Robert Frost and William Carlos

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.420
Williams and Ezra Pound--

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.120
really old, amazing
recordings of these

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.070
poets reading their work.

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:48.342
And then they have more
contemporary poets, as well.

00:40:48.342 --> 00:40:50.800
And I took those, and I kind
of sliced them up line by line

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.008
and then distributed them
around in different places.

00:40:53.008 --> 00:40:56.360
So I had all the first lines
of the poem in a certain area.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.230
So if you went to this area,
you could hear first line

00:40:59.230 --> 00:41:00.670
after first line
after first line.

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.290
Then you could go somewhere else
and hear all the last lines.

00:41:02.290 --> 00:41:03.880
And it made it very abstract.

00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:07.022
And the poets probably
would be very upset with me

00:41:07.022 --> 00:41:08.230
if they found out about this.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:17.485
But it was a remixing of
that, a spatial remixing,

00:41:17.485 --> 00:41:18.610
which was pretty fun to do.

00:41:18.610 --> 00:41:19.760
But I love your idea.

00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:23.200
So were you thinking of having
people read their own poetry

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.140
or something along those lines?

00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.282
So write a poem that related
to a certain location

00:41:29.282 --> 00:41:31.240
and then go to that
location and kind of recite

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.020
it sort of thing?

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:35.650
Or I could imagine if you want
to share any more thoughts.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:39.760
AUDIENCE: I was thinking about
while they're in the location,

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.200
creating a poem there.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:44.530
HALSEY BURGUND: Oh, almost
like improv or something

00:41:44.530 --> 00:41:49.480
like on the-- oh, yeah,
that could be really great.

00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:51.340
So yeah, the question would be--

00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.190
I mean, in a Roundware
context, that

00:41:54.190 --> 00:41:58.030
would be open the
app, press Speak,

00:41:58.030 --> 00:41:59.105
make up a poem right now.

00:41:59.105 --> 00:42:00.730
And then you just
press record, and you

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:03.040
would record it and then
upload it to the cloud.

00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:06.918
And then, whenever somebody else
came by, they could hear that.

00:42:06.918 --> 00:42:08.710
And then you'd have
the ability, of course,

00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:13.630
as an administrator in that
case to listen and move

00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:17.620
the recording or make the area
bigger or those sorts of things

00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:19.970
if you were to want to do that.

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:22.658
But that could be a
wonderful way of--

00:42:22.658 --> 00:42:24.700
it would be a nice way to
traverse a city, right?

00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:26.117
You kind of wander
through a city,

00:42:26.117 --> 00:42:33.440
and you hear residents'
improvised poetry

00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:36.560
at crosswalks or wherever.

00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:39.560
That's a cool idea.

00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.600
AUDIENCE: And you've been
working a lot on prompts,

00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:43.100
right?

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.008
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:42:44.008 --> 00:42:45.050
HALSEY BURGUND: Oh, cool.

00:42:45.050 --> 00:42:48.260
AUDIENCE: Things to sort of get
people who may not necessarily

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:49.752
appeal to [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:52.057 --> 00:42:54.390
HALSEY BURGUND: That's really
smart to think about that.

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.970
Because that's really hard.

00:42:56.970 --> 00:42:58.530
I mean, poetry is
particularly hard.

00:42:58.530 --> 00:43:02.170
But even for me, to say
anything is sometimes hard.

00:43:02.170 --> 00:43:05.400
So I always think about
what questions I ask.

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.970
And I usually have some
question that's so broad

00:43:08.970 --> 00:43:12.210
that anybody could do it.

00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:16.080
Like just tell a
story about your day.

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:16.680
I don't know.

00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.820
Look at the ground and tell
me what it reminds you of.

00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:22.590
I'm just sorry.

00:43:22.590 --> 00:43:24.090
I'm making up bad
examples right now

00:43:24.090 --> 00:43:26.700
but something that's very broad.

00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.520
I mean, literally, it could
just be, share something.

00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:31.300
Say something.

00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:34.590
And then, as I go down the
list, I get into more details.

00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:37.020
Because I find that
some people freak out

00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:38.610
when they have a
super-broad question.

00:43:38.610 --> 00:43:40.260
They're like, what do
you mean something?

00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:41.093
What does that mean?

00:43:41.093 --> 00:43:42.060
What is say something?

00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:44.760
They are much
happier being given

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:50.658
instructions like, look at a
tree near you and describe it.

00:43:50.658 --> 00:43:52.200
Then they're like,
OK, I can do that.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:53.500
There's a tree.

00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:54.000
Record.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:57.570
The tree is quite tall, and
it's got lots of branches.

00:43:57.570 --> 00:43:59.520
And the leaves
right now are green,

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:01.770
but they're starting
to turn yellow.

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.230
Some people are much more
comfortable with that.

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:07.350
So in a poetry context, that
could be really interesting.

00:44:07.350 --> 00:44:10.230
What are some prompts that
you've come up with thus far?

00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:12.426
Because that's a challenge.

00:44:12.426 --> 00:44:13.370
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:16.760
Right now, I've just been
thinking about sound.

00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:24.750
So it wasn't necessarily a
poem about sound but ask,

00:44:24.750 --> 00:44:27.180
what sounds can
you hear right now?

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:30.040
What can you really [INAUDIBLE]?

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:32.650
For one test, I
asked them to write

00:44:32.650 --> 00:44:37.960
a poem about a different subject
based on the sounds they heard.

00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:41.530
HALSEY BURGUND: You mean
like a poem about sound

00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:44.538
that isn't about what
that sound is, actually?

00:44:44.538 --> 00:44:45.580
Like what it reminds you?

00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:46.120
Is that what you're saying?

00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:46.750
Sorry, I'm--

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.880
AUDIENCE: Kind of.

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:51.900
The theme is not necessarily
the sound itself.

00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:53.040
HALSEY BURGUND: Right.

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:57.360
So what it reminds you
of or what it maybe

00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.120
points towards or
something like that, yeah.

00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.060
Yeah, no, that's
great to use sound.

00:45:03.060 --> 00:45:06.456
Poetry is such a--

00:45:06.456 --> 00:45:09.063
in my mind, poetry
is meant to be read.

00:45:09.063 --> 00:45:10.980
It's got all the rhythms
and everything really

00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:14.440
come out when it gets into the
audio from just the written

00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:14.940
page.

00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:17.273
I mean, the written page can
be really interesting, too.

00:45:20.787 --> 00:45:21.370
But it's hard.

00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.440
It's hard to just
make up a poem.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.310
And it must rhyme!

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:30.350
AUDIENCE: I think that one's not
so strict on your [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:31.990
but a little bit
more free verse.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:32.800
HALSEY BURGUND:
Yes, that's good.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.300
That's good.

00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:35.500
Yes, free form is--

00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.940
I'm always impressed with free
form rap battles and stuff

00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.110
like that.

00:45:41.110 --> 00:45:43.120
I mean, obviously, M&M is the--

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:45.980
the 8 Mile thing, it's
just like, oh, my gosh.

00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:48.400
How do they come
up with this stuff?

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.570
And I know a lot of it is--

00:45:49.570 --> 00:45:52.570
I know there are strategies
and techniques that

00:45:52.570 --> 00:45:53.560
make it more doable.

00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:56.630
But my brain doesn't
work that way.

00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:59.092
I can't just-- although it
sounds like it right now,

00:45:59.092 --> 00:46:00.300
that I can just talk forever.

00:46:00.300 --> 00:46:05.320
But I don't always--

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.400
not always able to.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:11.020
AUDIENCE: If you write the
audio SDKs, you probably could.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:11.960
HALSEY BURGUND: Yeah.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:12.460
Right.

00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.650
Oh, that reminds
me, I should also

00:46:14.650 --> 00:46:21.430
mention that I have started a
new website called audioar.org.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:23.590
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we
got your Webpost for--

00:46:23.590 --> 00:46:25.780
HALSEY BURGUND: Oh,
great, great, great.

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.647
So the site is in its
infancy right now.

00:46:28.647 --> 00:46:30.730
I've started it with a
couple colleagues, a couple

00:46:30.730 --> 00:46:34.660
journalists, and Fran, who
came here a few months ago--

00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:35.440
Fran Panetta.

00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:35.710
AUDIENCE: A month ago.

00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:36.877
HALSEY BURGUND: A month ago?

00:46:36.877 --> 00:46:38.830
To talk to you guys.

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:39.805
British.

00:46:39.805 --> 00:46:42.040
You probably remember
because her very perfect

00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:42.700
British accent.

00:46:45.910 --> 00:46:48.070
So she has been doing
audio AR stuff, obviously,

00:46:48.070 --> 00:46:49.340
as you know, for a while, too.

00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:52.390
So we started this
site just to try

00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:55.450
to collect different
practitioners in the area.

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:58.880
And it felt like something
was starting-- companies,

00:46:58.880 --> 00:46:59.380
obviously.

00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:03.400
Bose and Amazon and Apple and
others are getting interested.

00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:08.380
And we thought it would be a
nice place to let practitioners

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:15.140
and technologists and academics
and other people share

00:47:15.140 --> 00:47:17.140
their experiences, things
that work, things that

00:47:17.140 --> 00:47:22.870
didn't work, and let people
know when projects are happening

00:47:22.870 --> 00:47:23.470
and whatnot.

00:47:23.470 --> 00:47:25.420
So we're ramping up on that.

00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:28.600
And Philip has agreed to
be interviewed for that,

00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:31.717
at some point, whenever
I get myself in gear.

00:47:31.717 --> 00:47:33.800
I promise I will, and I'm
looking forward to that.

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:34.240
AUDIENCE: No rush.

00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:34.840
HALSEY BURGUND: Yeah, I know.

00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:36.070
You're like, please forget.

00:47:36.070 --> 00:47:38.550
[LAUGHS] No.

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.300
But yeah, any
projects you guys do,

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:45.040
and we'd love to think about
getting stuff up there.

00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:50.020
Because I think this class
is evidence of the fact

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.168
that it is becoming
a real thing, which

00:47:53.168 --> 00:47:53.960
is really exciting.

00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.620
So I'm super excited to
hear or to experience

00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:03.400
what you guys choose
to do with the class.

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:05.823
Is a project sort of the
deliverable for the class?

00:48:05.823 --> 00:48:06.490
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:48:06.490 --> 00:48:14.150
So there will be a presentation.

00:48:14.150 --> 00:48:16.190
We need to discuss
that before you leave,

00:48:16.190 --> 00:48:17.900
when it's going to happen.

00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.700
Because there are
possible changes there.

00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:25.280
But there will be a presentation
at the end of the class.

00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:28.460
Francesca will hopefully attend.

00:48:28.460 --> 00:48:30.500
Some people from
Bose will attend.

00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.210
If you can come,
that would be great.

00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.540
HALSEY BURGUND: Oh, cool.

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:33.730
Yeah, yeah, keep me posted.

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:38.420
AUDIENCE: Otherwise, we'll
spend the next two weeks

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.960
thinking through
how to disseminate

00:48:41.960 --> 00:48:44.330
our insights from the class.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:47.810
So there will be something
online, I dare say.

00:48:47.810 --> 00:48:50.810
But we will try to
decide that together,

00:48:50.810 --> 00:48:53.900
exactly what form it will take.

00:48:53.900 --> 00:48:56.060
So there will be something.

00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:57.215
We will leave a trace.

00:48:57.215 --> 00:48:59.090
HALSEY BURGUND: Well,
to the extent possible,

00:48:59.090 --> 00:49:02.550
we'd love to amplify that
message on audioar.org

00:49:02.550 --> 00:49:03.680
if it's possible.

00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:05.570
But we can obviously
talk about that.

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:06.080
But yeah.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:08.288
So if you guys have any
ideas about things to include

00:49:08.288 --> 00:49:11.210
or practitioners or whatever,
please feel free to reach out.

00:49:11.210 --> 00:49:18.810
Because we are super open and
want to learn from each other.

00:49:18.810 --> 00:49:20.460
AUDIENCE: So we're
running out of time,

00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:23.715
but I am very curious about
one aspect of the system.

00:49:27.321 --> 00:49:32.180
Is it dynamic in
any way that people

00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:34.210
who make contribution
could actually

00:49:34.210 --> 00:49:40.240
change parameters or aspects of
the experience for other people

00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.490
beyond just the sound
trace they leave?

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:46.120
So an example would
be like if there's

00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.450
a lot of people leaving--

00:49:49.450 --> 00:49:52.330
I don't know why I decided
to call them sound traces--

00:49:52.330 --> 00:49:55.060
but if a lot of people
leave sound traces

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:59.650
in the same location,
can the system

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:03.970
detect that take and
decide to play sort

00:50:03.970 --> 00:50:11.710
of a more multi-layered
ambient soundtrack in that area

00:50:11.710 --> 00:50:18.220
or something, some way of being
aware of what's being inputed?

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:22.050
HALSEY BURGUND: That's a
really interesting area

00:50:22.050 --> 00:50:23.440
to think about.

00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:27.300
The simple answer
right now is no,

00:50:27.300 --> 00:50:31.050
in the sense that
Roundware doesn't--

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:36.500
I mean, Roundware, you
can choose how many

00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.200
simultaneous voices can play.

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:43.790
And therefore, if you say,
well, three simultaneous voices

00:50:43.790 --> 00:50:46.040
can play if three
are available, then,

00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:49.700
in that sense, if there's a
location where people add more,

00:50:49.700 --> 00:50:52.430
then that will be a location
where, potentially, three

00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:53.210
will--

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.260
if there's a
hundred in the spot,

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:55.820
you'll probably have
three playing altogether

00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:56.880
at any given time.

00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:58.505
That's not the music
layer or whatever.

00:50:58.505 --> 00:51:01.580
That's just the--
whereas if you have

00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.873
a spot that only has one
available, even though three

00:51:03.873 --> 00:51:05.540
could potentially
play at the same time,

00:51:05.540 --> 00:51:07.130
only one will ever actually
play because there's

00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.730
only one available.

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:09.590
So that's a very, very
rudimentary aspect

00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:10.882
of what you were talking about.

00:51:10.882 --> 00:51:11.840
And that's the only--

00:51:11.840 --> 00:51:13.715
at least if I'm
understanding you correctly--

00:51:13.715 --> 00:51:15.980
that's the only thing that
Roundware does currently.

00:51:15.980 --> 00:51:16.890
But I love this idea.

00:51:16.890 --> 00:51:18.057
I hadn't thought about this.

00:51:18.057 --> 00:51:20.750
I love this idea
of more activity,

00:51:20.750 --> 00:51:23.150
the heat map heats up and
something changes with--

00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:24.650
AUDIENCE: Yeah, we
are always trying

00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:26.690
to think about is
there a way I can

00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:28.980
program this as a participant?

00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:31.010
Because we're at MIT.

00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:35.780
So there might be a way, even
if you don't know it, injecting

00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.580
code some weird way by--

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:40.410
HALSEY BURGUND: Yeah, who knows?

00:51:40.410 --> 00:51:44.910
AUDIENCE: --overloading
the database or something.

00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:52.350
But it's just I think there is
some potential there somewhere.

00:51:52.350 --> 00:51:54.510
It could be very
advanced, like the words

00:51:54.510 --> 00:51:57.920
you say could actually be
understood by the system,

00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:59.045
and it could change things.

00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:05.962
Then, yeah, you're
halfway to The Matrix.

00:52:05.962 --> 00:52:07.170
HALSEY BURGUND: I don't know.

00:52:07.170 --> 00:52:08.820
I've been thinking
about the first step

00:52:08.820 --> 00:52:10.770
to that, obviously,
is getting some kind

00:52:10.770 --> 00:52:14.370
of accurate translation
or transcription service

00:52:14.370 --> 00:52:15.342
automated.

00:52:15.342 --> 00:52:16.800
And then you could
get to the point

00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:19.980
where you could
search for only play

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:21.650
me commentary that
uses the word "love."

00:52:21.650 --> 00:52:24.150
And then you could walk around
and get this whole experience

00:52:24.150 --> 00:52:25.452
with just--

00:52:25.452 --> 00:52:26.910
and then you do
sentiment analysis.

00:52:26.910 --> 00:52:30.990
And then it's like only give
me the comments that feel love,

00:52:30.990 --> 00:52:33.330
even though they don't say
love, but they feel it.

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:36.270
So I think those are
super-exciting areas

00:52:36.270 --> 00:52:37.215
to look into.

00:52:37.215 --> 00:52:39.840
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I just want
to know what the zombie

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:42.450
people would do with
something like that,

00:52:42.450 --> 00:52:46.780
right, where they can
affect the system itself.

00:52:46.780 --> 00:52:48.530
HALSEY BURGUND: Or the
zombies themselves.

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:49.155
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:52:49.155 --> 00:52:53.280
HALSEY BURGUND: Yeah, this
is very, very important.

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:55.560
But I love that idea.

00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:57.150
And yeah.

00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:59.040
So it's open source.

00:52:59.040 --> 00:52:59.640
You go for it.

00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.140
[LAUGHS]

00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:02.970
AUDIENCE: We're out of time.

00:53:02.970 --> 00:53:04.620
This was really helpful.

00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:07.920
Actually, we have one
team who are out today

00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.000
because of medical emergencies
that are basically doing

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.378
the kind of Pokémon
GO with music.

00:53:14.378 --> 00:53:15.420
HALSEY BURGUND: Oh, cool.

00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:19.930
AUDIENCE: So we'll definitely
have them look at your system.

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:23.515
And they, I would guess,
will want to use it.

00:53:23.515 --> 00:53:25.390
HALSEY BURGUND: Well,
feel free to reach out.

00:53:25.390 --> 00:53:29.670
I can, again, depending on
the level of technical skill

00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:33.270
and time involved,
or time available,

00:53:33.270 --> 00:53:35.407
I can recommend different
approaches to things.

00:53:35.407 --> 00:53:36.490
But all the code is there.

00:53:36.490 --> 00:53:39.420
The server is written
in Python using Django.

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:42.090
Obviously, iOS is Swift.

00:53:42.090 --> 00:53:45.990
And the web stuff is
very nascent right now,

00:53:45.990 --> 00:53:50.280
but it's all JavaScript, sort
of modern-day JavaScript stuff.

00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:51.510
So to the extent.

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:52.140
Yes?

00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:53.160
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:56.520
But is there a way to
procedurally generate

00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:03.840
a location for a sound
byte, or is it totally tied?

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:06.540
HALSEY BURGUND: Can you
describe what scenario?

00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:10.010
Like, what input would
you be taking to--

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:12.360
AUDIENCE: So this has to
do with the Pokémon GO,

00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:17.520
like audio music project
that Chuck was doing.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.612
Chuck and?

00:54:18.612 --> 00:54:19.320
AUDIENCE: Terese?

00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:20.355
AUDIENCE: Terese, yeah--

00:54:20.355 --> 00:54:21.480
Chuck and Terese are doing.

00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:26.550
Anyway, so in Pokémon
GO, you walk around.

00:54:26.550 --> 00:54:32.010
Pokémon spawn, Can
audio also spawn--

00:54:32.010 --> 00:54:33.360
AUDIENCE: The probability--

00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:34.830
AUDIENCE: --based
on a probability?

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:35.705
HALSEY BURGUND: Yeah.

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:42.330
That would be the
kind of thing that

00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:44.190
would be a relatively
small modification

00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:45.240
for a particular project.

00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.110
I haven't done that.

00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:47.943
The other thing that I
haven't done that I'm

00:54:47.943 --> 00:54:50.250
very excited about is moving.

00:54:50.250 --> 00:54:52.320
After their spawn,
then they move.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:56.550
You assign a path and a time,
whatever, and they loop around.

00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:58.290
So then, you can just
sit in one place,

00:54:58.290 --> 00:55:00.240
and you can let
stuff flow over you.

00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.070
Or you can move
around, and there's

00:55:02.070 --> 00:55:04.730
this sort of double
interaction in that sense.

00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:06.480
So it's a single
interaction, but you know

00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:08.460
what I mean-- double motion.

00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:14.100
So that kind of dynamism,
I think, is very exciting.

00:55:14.100 --> 00:55:17.880
But yeah, I like the idea of
spawning, sort of popping up,

00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.330
based on maybe your
previous experience

00:55:21.330 --> 00:55:23.350
within the app or
something like that.

00:55:23.350 --> 00:55:27.300
But yeah, I think the framework
is there that you can--

00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:28.710
I've been just
adding stuff as we

00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:31.470
go, semi-organic codebase
in that sense, which

00:55:31.470 --> 00:55:32.520
is sometimes problematic.

00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:34.270
But it's fairly clean.

00:55:34.270 --> 00:55:36.370
So check it out.

00:55:36.370 --> 00:55:39.580
If you know Python, you can jump
in and have a look, all right?

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.715
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:55:40.715 --> 00:55:41.548
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:55:41.548 --> 00:55:42.040
It's been--

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:42.970
HALSEY BURGUND: Thank
you guys so much.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:43.780
Thank you.

00:55:43.780 --> 00:55:45.630
[APPLAUSE]

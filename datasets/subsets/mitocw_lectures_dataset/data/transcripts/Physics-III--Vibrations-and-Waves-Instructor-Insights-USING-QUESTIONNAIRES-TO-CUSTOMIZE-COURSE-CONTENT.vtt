YEN-JIE LEE: I try to include
a questionnaire during

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.900
the semester, in--

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.940
I think, it's actually in
the middle of the semester--

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.320
along with the problem set.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.010
So the reason is the following.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.800
I would like to know
how my class is doing.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.180
Because every year, the
composition of the students

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.650
is actually different.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.750
Every semester is, actually,
they are different.

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.570
And also students may have
different background knowledge

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.120
semester by semester.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.960
So doing this kind
of questionnaire

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.240
will help me to
understand where we are

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.390
and whether we are doing
great, or are we actually

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.150
moving too fast or too slow?

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:57.450
Are we not giving enough help
or giving too much homework?

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:03.730
And is everybody keeping
up with the content

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:05.910
which we cover
during the lecture?

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.160
And this kind of feedback
is actually, particularly

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.530
useful during the semester.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.780
Because during the
semester, I still

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.600
have the chance to
adjust the speed,

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.730
to adjust the
content, which will

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.220
be suitable for the
composition of the students

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.640
I get in the class
this semester.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.970
So that is actually why I try
to ask them to provide feedback

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.200
on first, the speed
of the course.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.160
Second, how helpful is the
lecture, and the instructor,

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.030
and also the
recitation sections?

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.500
And finally, how is
actually the problem

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.590
sets and the other
materials actually

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.690
help you with the learning?

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.200
Do we need more for example
... do we need more solved

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.280
examples?

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.950
Do we need more
ways to communicate

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.050
between the instructors
and the students,

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.520
such that the students can
get the help they need--

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.860
not only through the
lecture, but also

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.990
through the Piazza program which
we have during this semester.

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.670
And also by emails,
and the recitations,

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.080
and the office hour, with
the instructors and the TAs.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.190
So with that kind
of survey, we will

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.040
be able to get the feedback
during the semester.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.560
And we can actually
adjust to actually fit

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.115
the need of the class.

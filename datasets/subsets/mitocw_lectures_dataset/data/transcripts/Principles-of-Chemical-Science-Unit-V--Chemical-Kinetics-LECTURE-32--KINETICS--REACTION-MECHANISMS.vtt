00:00:34.582 --> 00:00:35.790
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.280
So 10 more seconds.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.730
OK.

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.275
Let's quiet down.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.800
So that is the-- you got the
70% with the right answer.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.676
If people can just yell out
what was wrong with number one.

00:01:18.676 --> 00:01:19.490
AUDIENCE: Sig figs.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.940
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Sig figs.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.400
And what about numbers
three and four?

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.502
What equation was that using?

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:26.460
AUDIENCE: Second order.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.190
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Second order.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.930
That's right.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.390
So this is a good
clicker question

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.260
for a problem that's going
to be coming up on exam four

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:37.890
and also on the final
exam to a larger degree.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.560
On the final exam we
have equation sheets

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.530
that have all the equations
from the whole semester,

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.940
and so you need to figure out
and remember which equation

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.280
goes with which problem.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.300
It doesn't say, oh, here is
the expression for first order.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.730
Here's the equation
for second order.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.800
You need to look
and remember which

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.290
equation goes with which thing.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.120
But in terms of
first order, what's

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.360
a way that you can
remember what a first order

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.260
equation would be?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.199
What's missing from first order?

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.240
Yeah, the concentration
in the material.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.700
So for first order
it's independent

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.120
of the original concentration
in the material, which

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.700
is why we can use
first order equations

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.470
for nuclear chemistry.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.070
Because the rate of decay
of radioactive nuclei

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.320
are independent of the
nuclei around them,

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.060
so it's a first order process.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.440
So when you think a little
bit about these equations,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.950
you should be able to
identify which equation

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.670
goes with which problem.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.110
And so you can identify the type
of first order problems also.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.810
And for the second order
it almost always says,

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.210
for this second
order process, which

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.880
gives you a nice hint that
that's a second order process.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.440
And then you just have
to identify the equation.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.940
OK.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.350
So today is more kinetics.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.840
So we're in the kinetics unit.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.430
We'll be in the kinetics unit
for the rest of the semester.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.710
It's our last unit.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.470
So today I think is one of
the most important lectures

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.930
in terms of the kinetics
unit because we're

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.000
talking about
reaction mechanisms,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.360
and that is really an
important part of kinetics.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.270
So investigating
reaction mechanisms.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.805
So if you're going to describe
how a reaction takes place--

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:19.080
often reactions don't
occur in one step.

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.800
It's really uncommon for
reactions to occur in one step.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.560
So you want to describe
the different steps.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.570
And you describe those
steps, which are also

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.270
called elementary reactions.

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.460
So you break down
a complex reaction

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.620
into a series of
steps, and then you

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.110
try to figure out
if that mechanism,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.370
if those series of steps,
are consistent with the data

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.620
that you've collected on
this particular reaction.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.850
And over here I just
show you some steps

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.950
in the natural biosynthesis
of a vitamin biotin.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.460
Biotin is important
vitamin for us.

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.670
It's also used a
lot in feedstock.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.560
And so people buy a lot of
biotin to put in feed stock,

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.150
and so there's a huge
market of biotin.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.690
Now right now it's made
by what is estimated

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.510
to be a 13 step organic
synthesis which produces--

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:14.640
that's a lot of steps.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.290
It's really
expensive, and there's

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.519
a huge amount of organic waste
associated with making biotin.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.255
And we're talking about in
the tons level of waste.

00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:26.130
So researchers have been
trying to figure out

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.520
the mechanism by which
nature makes biotin

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.520
because that would be a lot
more environmentally friendly.

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.460
So when you're
thinking about this,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.800
what you want to say is, OK,
if we write out a mechanism

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.860
is it consistent with
the experimental data

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.080
and are there fast
and slow steps?

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.341
Because if there's a step
that's really slow maybe

00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:46.590
you can do something about it.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.420
Maybe if you're
talking about an enzyme

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.263
you could re-engineer the enzyme
so it would be a better enzyme.

00:04:52.263 --> 00:04:55.340
Maybe natural selection
didn't particularly work.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.710
Maybe the cell doesn't
really need as much biotin

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.900
as we do commercially, so there
was no need to make it fast.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.525
But now we have a
need to make it fast,

00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:06.740
so maybe we can do some
evolution of this enzyme

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.401
and design something
to be better.

00:05:08.401 --> 00:05:10.400
So when you're talking
about reaction mechanisms

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.620
you want to know what's
fast, what's slow.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.960
And if you want to use
that product for something,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.270
you want to figure out
how you can change things

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.040
to have a better
mechanism-- maybe

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:23.210
avoid some really slow steps
so that you can do better.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:26.690
Today is also World AIDS Day.

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.530
And understanding the
mechanism of HIV protease

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.140
was really essential
in designing inhibitors

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.320
against that enzyme.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.230
And if you inhibit
the enzyme you

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:38.250
stop the development
of the disease.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:40.010
So this was a very
important thing,

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.650
and we have some
pretty good molecules

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:43.760
to treat AIDS right now.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.134
And some of the challenges
have moved on to other things,

00:05:46.134 --> 00:05:48.920
like less good health care
in parts of the world where

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.050
this has affected.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.510
So I feel like AIDS has kind
of taken a backseat to hearing

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.940
about Ebola recently,
but AIDS is still

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.730
a very important problem
and one that smart people

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.230
like you could address.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.040
So again, understanding
reaction mechanisms

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.360
is very, very important.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.860
All right.

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.190
So let's go to a simpler
problem and a simpler reaction

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.960
mechanism.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.210
We'll go to our
friend over here where

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.780
we have two molecules
of NO reacting

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:23.720
with one molecule of O2 going
to two molecules of NO2.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.990
So someone measured
some rates for this

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:30.430
and came up with the
following rate law

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:32.690
where you have a rate
constant, which is just

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.390
called k obs for observed.

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:38.450
And we'll talk about that
more in a little bit.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.200
And they discovered it is
second order with respect to NO

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.620
and first order
with respect to O2.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.330
So there's a couple
of things right away

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:49.040
that we can ask about this.

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.200
One is, what is the overall
order then of this reaction

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.820
from this experimental data?

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.616
What would that be?

00:06:56.616 --> 00:06:57.359
AUDIENCE: Three.

00:06:57.359 --> 00:06:58.400
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Three.

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.990
Again, if some of you missed it.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.580
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.250
This is not where you want to
lose your points on the exam.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:06.680
There's going to be some
tricky significant figures

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:08.390
in the kinetics units.

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:10.420
Save your points to lose there.

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:13.810
Count 2 plus 1 and get 3.

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:18.650
So is one step likely to have
three different things come

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.390
together at the same time?

00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:22.970
So how likely is it that
all three things are

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.720
going to merge in one step?

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.540
No, it's not very
likely, so it's no.

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.680
But if it did work that way,
what would it be called?

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.815
What molecular reaction?

00:07:34.815 --> 00:07:35.656
Do you remember?

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:37.104
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:37.104 --> 00:07:39.020
CATHERINE DRENNAN: So
if you have three things

00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.890
it's a termolecular.

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:43.930
So they're rare.

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:46.480
So that's not how this works.

00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.020
All right.

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.680
So let's look at some rate
laws and try to write a rate

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.332
law for a reaction.

00:07:54.332 --> 00:07:56.040
We're going to take
our overall reaction,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.770
we're going to divide
it to two steps

00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.500
and write a rate law for
that and see if that's

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.710
consistent with the experiment.

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.210
So we finally got this up here.

00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.710
Sorry the handwriting
isn't perfect.

00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:08.990
I got here early but
then-- the first time I'm

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:10.640
going to use the
boards a lot today.

00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:11.480
Squeegee was gone.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.420
There's always something.

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.270
So we're going to break this
reaction down into two steps.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.187
So in the first step we
have our two molecules of NO

00:08:20.187 --> 00:08:25.160
coming together to form
an intermediate N2O2.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.220
And this is a reversible step.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.620
So in the second
step of the reaction

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:33.080
we have our O2
molecule coming in,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.570
reacting with our
intermediate and forming

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.049
two molecules of NO2.

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:40.100
And so this is
really pretty common

00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:42.380
that when you have a
multistep reaction that you

00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.730
form an intermediate and
your intermediate goes away.

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:50.000
So now we can think about how
we would write the rate law

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.645
for this particular mechanism.

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.440
So starting up here.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.130
This is being
written as a series

00:08:58.130 --> 00:09:01.760
of steps, which were also
called elementary reactions.

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:04.850
And for an elementary reaction
it occurs exactly as written.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:08.470
That's its definition of an
elementary reaction or a step.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:12.560
So now we can write the rate
law for the forward direction

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.730
of this exactly
as it is written.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:21.320
So that would be writing--
and these are my little K's

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.880
for rate constants.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:29.950
So we have K1 times the
concentration of NO to the 2.

00:09:29.950 --> 00:09:31.690
So we're writing it
exactly as written.

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.210
I said that for an
overall reaction

00:09:33.210 --> 00:09:35.870
you can't just look
at the stoichiometry.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:38.630
You have to think
about experiment.

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.450
But for an elementary
reaction you can write it just

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.420
from the stoichiometry,
and so this

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.130
is how we would write it
just from the stoichiometry.

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:48.920
So what would be the
order of that reaction?

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.090
Just the forward reaction?

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.590
2.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:57.274
And that makes it a what
kind of molecular reaction?

00:09:57.274 --> 00:09:58.190
AUDIENCE: Bimolecular.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:09:59.481
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Bimolecular.

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.110
Bimolecular.

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:04.050
OK.

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:08.490
So let's write out the rate law
for the reverse reaction now.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:10.740
And again, exactly as written.

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:16.680
So we're going to have K minus
1 times the concentration

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:18.660
of our intermediate N2O2.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.690
And that would be the rate
law for the reverse reaction.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:30.320
So what would be the order
for this reaction now?

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.040
1.

00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:31.540
Right.

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.390
We only have one thing in here.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.610
And what do you
call an x molecular

00:10:35.610 --> 00:10:37.183
when there's one thing?

00:10:37.183 --> 00:10:38.170
AUDIENCE: Uni.

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:39.128
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Uni.

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:43.820
Unimolecular.

00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.540
For step two now
you're good at this.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.720
Let's do a clicker question.

00:11:04.970 --> 00:11:05.470
All right.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.312
10 more seconds.

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:23.670
Yup.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:26.470
So we're just going to write
this exactly as written.

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:28.960
It doesn't say it's a
reversible reaction.

00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.780
So it's K2-- and I'll
put this down here.

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:38.520
K2-- our rate constant
for the second step--

00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:41.700
and then times the reactants.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:47.280
So we have O2 and our
intermediate N2O2.

00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:56.660
So what would be the order of
this reaction or this step?

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.690
Two?

00:11:57.690 --> 00:11:59.550
We have two things in there.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:03.000
And again, we call
that bimolecular.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.940
So we have uni-, bi-, and ter-
molecular reactions for order

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.160
of 1, 2, and 3.

00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:09.660
All right.

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.550
So we've written this out.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:19.360
Now what we want to do
is we want to write out

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.950
an overall rate law for this.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.430
So we've written
out the rate laws

00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.190
for all the individual steps.

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:32.360
And we'll put that-- Yeah,
I guess I can put it-- maybe

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:33.787
I'll try to write it down here.

00:12:33.787 --> 00:12:35.370
I was going to have
this all organized

00:12:35.370 --> 00:12:37.740
but then the boards
weren't cooperating today.

00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.560
So I'm going to write
the overall rate.

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.500
Let me try it here.

00:12:46.650 --> 00:12:51.390
And this is for
formation of N2O2.

00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:53.790
And we're going to
put a 2 in there,

00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.740
and I'll explain
that in a minute.

00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:59.040
Then our K2-- so we're
just writing this now

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:08.860
from the last step-- times
O2 and our intermediate N2O2.

00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:15.210
So the overall
rate of forming NO2

00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.240
is the 2 because 2
moles are formed.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:23.070
So as these guys
disappear-- as O2 and N2O2,

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:24.892
our intermediate,
disappear-- and O's

00:13:24.892 --> 00:13:26.600
going to form twice
as fast because there

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.120
are two of them being formed.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:30.060
So we put a 2 in there.

00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.400
And then we just have
a rate order or rate

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:36.660
law for the last step,
K2 O2 intermediate.

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:42.220
So you can always write the
rate for the overall reaction

00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:43.592
from that last step.

00:13:43.592 --> 00:13:46.050
Although sometimes we'll see
if they're fast and slow steps

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:49.570
you can also write it from
the rate determining step.

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:53.460
But we're not done here
because we have an intermediate

00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:54.910
in this expression.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:59.160
And in a rate law you cannot
have an intermediate in there.

00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.880
You need to solve for the
rate in terms of your rate

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:05.940
constants, your reactant
concentration, and your product

00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:07.050
concentration.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:08.740
So we need to get rid of this.

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:13.020
We need to solve for this.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.590
So how are we going to do that?

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.350
How are we going
to solve for this?

00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:20.350
So we want to think
about now, what

00:14:20.350 --> 00:14:23.640
is the net rate
for this formation?

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.950
How is that intermediate
being formed,

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:30.130
and how is it being consumed
given those steps up here?

00:14:30.130 --> 00:14:35.415
So it's only being formed
in the forward direction

00:14:35.415 --> 00:14:38.160
of the first step.

00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.000
And let me just grab this.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.970
So the forward direction of the
first step, which is K1 times

00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:52.330
NO to the 2.

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.150
And so this is where our
intermediate is formed.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:03.010
Our intermediate is going
away in two different steps.

00:15:03.010 --> 00:15:07.570
So it's going away in the
reverse direction of step one.

00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:11.410
So it's decomposing
in that step.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.730
And so it's
decomposing at the rate

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:16.980
of K minus 1 times
its concentration.

00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.090
The intermediate is also being
consumed in the second step.

00:15:24.090 --> 00:15:27.210
It's reacting with oxygen
and being consumed.

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:36.510
So here it decays and
here it is consumed.

00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:38.640
And it's being consumed
by the reaction

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:44.046
K2 times the concentration of
O2 times its concentration.

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:51.050
So that's the second step.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:54.230
So now we just need
to take that equation

00:15:54.230 --> 00:15:58.850
and solve for the
intermediate N2O2.

00:15:58.850 --> 00:16:02.690
But we don't know
net rate over there.

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.090
We have too many
variables right now.

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:08.600
So at this point we have to use
what's known as a steady state

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.490
approximation.

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.885
So steady state approximation
and pretty much everything--

00:16:14.885 --> 00:16:16.880
I'm talking about
reaction mechanisms--

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.560
we're going to use the
steady state approximation.

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.450
And that is that the rate of
formation of intermediates

00:16:23.450 --> 00:16:26.810
equals the rate at
which they go away.

00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:29.900
So the net rate is 0.

00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:36.230
So we can set this whole
thing now equal to 0.

00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:38.570
So steady state
approximation net rate

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:44.060
is 0, or the rate at which
an intermediate forms equals

00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:49.190
the rate at which that
intermediate decays.

00:16:49.190 --> 00:16:52.140
So I can rearrange
this equation now,

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:54.410
and I'm going to bring
the terms that have

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.530
the intermediate to one side.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:59.970
So I'm going to
put them over here.

00:16:59.970 --> 00:17:03.830
So we have the term
at which it decays--

00:17:03.830 --> 00:17:07.430
K minus 1 times
our concentration

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:09.599
of our intermediate.

00:17:09.599 --> 00:17:12.260
And it had a negative but
I brought it over here

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:15.260
to this side with a 0,
so now it's positive.

00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.250
And I'm going to bring the same
for the rate law at which it's

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:20.869
consumed over.

00:17:20.869 --> 00:17:27.680
So that's K2 times our
intermediate concentration

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:30.770
and our oxygen concentration.

00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:32.570
And now on the other
side we'll have

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:34.730
the rate at which the
intermediate is formed,

00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:39.080
which is K1 No to the 2.

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.750
So this is another way to
express the steady state

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.010
approximation.

00:17:43.010 --> 00:17:46.070
The rate at which the
intermediate goes away

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:48.240
equals the rate at
which it's formed.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.640
That's the steady state.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:52.730
There's no sort of flux
in the intermediate.

00:17:52.730 --> 00:17:56.270
It's being formed and
going away at equal rates.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.240
So now we can use this to
solve for the intermediate.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.440
Now we're set.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.780
Now we can solve for
the intermediate.

00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.060
And so let's do that over here.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.680
So I'm going to pull out--
I had a straight line here.

00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.150
This one's a little crooked.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.610
I used to write a
lot on the board

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.090
and used to evaluate professors
by their good handwriting

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:20.630
and my ratings were always--
my overall rating was limited

00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:22.527
by my handwriting
to a large degree

00:18:22.527 --> 00:18:24.110
and so I stopped
writing on the board.

00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.450
But now they've got rid
of that as a criteria,

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:28.790
so I can write on
the board again.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:32.030
So I'm going to pull
out the concentration

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:37.820
of the intermediate-- our N2O2.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:41.560
and I'll pull it out of
the expression leaving

00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:52.410
K minus 1 and K2 times O2.

00:18:52.410 --> 00:18:54.290
So I just pulled out
the concentration

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.690
of the intermediate over here.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:58.700
And then we leave the
other side the same.

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.950
Our K1 times our NO squared.

00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.010
So now I can solve
for the concentration

00:19:07.010 --> 00:19:09.060
of the intermediate.

00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:20.780
N2O2 equals K1 times NO
squared over K minus 1

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:26.830
plus K2 times O2.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:27.890
Great.

00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:30.020
So we've solved for
the concentration

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.840
of the intermediate now.

00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.580
Now we can take this and
bring it back over here

00:19:37.580 --> 00:19:40.430
and put that whole
term into this.

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.850
And then we'll have a rate
law that is expressed only

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:48.010
in terms of our rate
constants and our reactants

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:48.676
and/or products.

00:19:51.290 --> 00:19:58.520
So let's do more on
the PowerPoint here.

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:02.310
So this is what we
just came up with.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:06.290
So the concentration of
our intermediate K1 times

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:11.060
NO-- one of our reactants
second order-- over K minus 1

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:15.500
plus K2 times the
concentration of oxygen.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:21.620
Now I'm going to plug that into
this expression, which we just

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:26.720
got from writing the rate law
for the last step using a 2

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.850
because we have two molecules
of product being formed.

00:20:29.850 --> 00:20:32.880
So we're going to
plug it in there,

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.830
and that's going
to give us this.

00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:39.840
So we have our 2, we have a
K1 from here, a K2 from here,

00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:42.600
we have our oxygen
concentration,

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:46.980
we have our NO overconcentration
second order over K minus 1

00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:52.220
plus K2 times
concentration of oxygen.

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.920
So that might be the complete
answer to some problems

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:59.100
but here we were given
an experimental rate

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:03.900
law, which was second order
in NO and first order in O2.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.720
That does not match this.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.850
Term has an O2 at the bottom.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.250
This one doesn't have
an O2 at the bottom.

00:21:11.250 --> 00:21:13.050
These are not the same.

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.960
So that must mean
that the mechanism has

00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.010
fast and slow steps
and that we need

00:21:19.010 --> 00:21:25.560
to reconsider this expression
in terms of fast and slow steps.

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:30.220
So let's go back now and
think about our mechanism.

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:33.810
And so if we come
over here-- let's

00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:42.570
say that the first step--
let's bring this down again.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.250
Let's say the
first step is fast.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.470
And we already said
that it was reversible,

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:51.250
but we'll put that down too.

00:21:51.250 --> 00:21:53.460
Is fast and reversible.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:56.820
And step two is slow.

00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:00.120
So I'm just going to
propose that these are true,

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:04.680
and then we will recalculate
what the rate law would

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.020
be if you have a fast reversible
step followed by a slow step

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:10.715
and see if that agrees
with experiment.

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.720
So to do that we
have to consider

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:27.010
what it means if we have a fast
step followed by a slow step.

00:22:27.010 --> 00:22:31.740
So let's introduce a term--
very important term-- which

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:33.840
is the rate determining step.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.650
Also known as the
rate limiting step.

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:42.660
So the slow step of a reaction,
if it's truly a very slow step,

00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:45.912
is going to govern the
overall rate of the reaction.

00:22:45.912 --> 00:22:47.370
So let's think
about this a minute.

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.660
So I told you that the
extra problems for exam four

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:52.770
are long.

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:54.020
They're very long.

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.770
Sorry about that, but there
were a lot of problems

00:22:56.770 --> 00:22:58.770
and I wanted to get you
ready for exam four.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:02.530
You also have problem
set nine due tomorrow.

00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.710
So you've got a lot
of problems to do.

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:08.840
So after class today I
feel that many of you

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.970
are going to be
really inspired to get

00:23:11.970 --> 00:23:14.490
started on those problems.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.010
And you may run out of here.

00:23:16.010 --> 00:23:18.839
You might leap over the chair
in front of you and race

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:19.380
out the door.

00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:21.370
You may clear the
table on the way out

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:25.520
because you're in a real hurry
to start those extra problems.

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:28.022
You will run to the library
to look for a table,

00:23:28.022 --> 00:23:29.730
but all the tables
will already be taken.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.160
How did your classmates
get out of class so fast

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.340
to get all of the
tables in the library?

00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:36.450
And they're already
finishing problem set nine

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.450
and starting on
the extra problems.

00:23:39.450 --> 00:23:41.910
So you race back to your
dorm, but all the tables

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:43.890
in the downstairs
of the dorm are also

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:46.230
filled with 5.111 students.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:48.672
So finally, on the fifth
floor of one of the dorms

00:23:48.672 --> 00:23:50.880
you find an empty table,
and then you're really fast.

00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:52.440
You got the problems out,
you got your pencils out,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.898
you got your calculator out,
you've got old equation sheets

00:23:54.898 --> 00:23:56.110
out, and ready to go.

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:58.170
It's like two seconds.

00:23:58.170 --> 00:24:00.900
So it took you 40 minutes
to find a free table

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:04.590
at MIT that didn't already
have a 5.111 student sitting

00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:07.860
and doing those extra
problems and problem set nine.

00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:10.230
So it was 40 minutes
plus 2 seconds

00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:12.850
to actually start
doing the problems.

00:24:12.850 --> 00:24:16.310
So the rate determining
or rate limiting step

00:24:16.310 --> 00:24:17.760
was finding your table.

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.240
40 minutes plus 2 seconds
is pretty much 40 minutes,

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.700
and that's what happens in
these reaction mechanisms.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.980
If you have a really
slow step that

00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:29.650
governs the overall
rate of the reaction.

00:24:29.650 --> 00:24:32.190
Now a lot of you know also
about rate determining steps

00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:36.399
because some of you may be
the rate determining step

00:24:36.399 --> 00:24:37.440
in your group of friends.

00:24:40.650 --> 00:24:44.320
The rate at which you
get to dinner and eat

00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.020
is determined by you
being ready to go.

00:24:49.714 --> 00:24:51.630
Some are in the room
like me, yeah, that's me.

00:24:51.630 --> 00:24:54.730
You know who you are.

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:56.190
So I'm saying that
what you gotta

00:24:56.190 --> 00:25:02.200
do to not let yourself be that
person-- that rate determining

00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:08.850
person, the RDS in your group of
friends-- you need to get sleep

00:25:08.850 --> 00:25:11.740
and you need to eat well
and you need to make sure

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.150
you got your ATP.

00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:18.280
And that means,
of course, to get

00:25:18.280 --> 00:25:23.170
enough sleep you gotta start
problems sets early, especially

00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:25.640
the extra problems
because they're long.

00:25:28.355 --> 00:25:30.820
Rate determining steps.

00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.752
Very important.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:40.510
So let's get back
to our example.

00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:43.410
And we made a proposal.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:46.480
We made a proposal
that step two was

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.830
going to be rate determining.

00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.380
That was slow.

00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:53.320
We made the proposal that step
one was fast and reversible.

00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:55.920
Step two was slow.

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:58.620
So what that's
going to mean then

00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:04.240
is that our rate law for the
first step-- that's fast.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.250
That's a big number.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.760
The rate for the
second step is slow.

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.590
Rate determining.

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:18.210
So that will mean then that K1
is going to be greater than K2

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:21.767
times O2, so we can drop
out our concentrations here

00:26:21.767 --> 00:26:22.600
to think about them.

00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:23.830
They're going to be the same.

00:26:23.830 --> 00:26:24.590
So what's left?

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.660
That means the rate constant for
that reverse step is very fast.

00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:28.940
It's a big number.

00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:33.790
That's going to be big
compared to K2 times O2.

00:26:33.790 --> 00:26:36.210
So now we can go back and
look at our expression

00:26:36.210 --> 00:26:37.840
for the intermediate.

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.430
And we note that K
minus 1 is in the bottom

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:46.700
as well as K2 times O2 is in
the bottom of the expression.

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.590
So if K minus 1 now is really
big compared to K2 times

00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:54.200
O2-- again, that's
the fast step; that's

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.640
the slow step-- then this term
pretty much doesn't matter

00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:59.640
and it can drop out.

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.750
Because this is really
small compared to that.

00:27:04.750 --> 00:27:09.640
And if we drop out this term
we can rewrite the expression

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.810
like this.

00:27:10.810 --> 00:27:15.010
The concentration of our
intermediate rate constant K1

00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:18.860
NO squared over K minus 1.

00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:21.280
And now we can
rearrange this equation,

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.390
bringing the concentrations to
one side and our rate constants

00:27:25.390 --> 00:27:26.780
to the other side.

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:31.410
So we have our intermediate
N2O2 over NO squared

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:35.080
equals rate constant
K1 over K minus 1.

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:42.700
What does rate constant K1 over
rate constant K minus 1 equal?

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:44.700
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:48.210
CATHERINE DRENNAN: It equals
the equilibrium constant K1

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.420
for the first step.

00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.450
So if you have a fast reversible
step followed by a slow step,

00:27:55.450 --> 00:27:58.480
the first step is
basically in equilibrium.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.900
We can make that approximation
that it is in equilibrium

00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:07.540
and solve it by thinking
about equilibrium expressions.

00:28:07.540 --> 00:28:09.040
Fantastic.

00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.590
We can be back to
equilibrium expressions.

00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:15.600
So let's think about
this a little bit more.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.880
Here I have a pretty
picture for you.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.590
So here we have our reactants
forming our intermediates.

00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:23.500
The intermediates are also going
back and forming our reactants.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.840
Reactants are forming the
intermediates and then

00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:26.770
back again.

00:28:26.770 --> 00:28:28.540
Fast reversible.

00:28:28.540 --> 00:28:32.130
Every once in a while an
intermediate gets siphoned off

00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:36.040
to products, but if this is
a really, really slow step

00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.270
it doesn't happen very often.

00:28:37.270 --> 00:28:40.570
It doesn't really
affect this very much.

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.890
And so basically, this
is in equilibrium.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.900
It's like this part
doesn't even really matter.

00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:46.440
It doesn't play in.

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:49.960
So when we have a fast
reversible step followed

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.840
by a slow step, we can
assume the first step is

00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:56.610
in equilibrium and we can
solve for our intermediate

00:28:56.610 --> 00:29:00.860
using equilibrium expressions.

00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.150
So let's do that.

00:29:02.150 --> 00:29:05.260
Let's take our equilibrium
expression for the first step

00:29:05.260 --> 00:29:09.100
and now plug it in
to our rate law.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:12.040
So we can substitute
this step now

00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.740
or we can have rate
constants or we can

00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.056
have an equilibrium constant.

00:29:16.056 --> 00:29:16.930
You can write either.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:18.550
These are equivalent.

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:21.900
And we can put those
back into this,

00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:25.980
which was our original
overall rate that we wrote.

00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.440
We weren't done though because
we had an intermediate.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:33.070
So we can plug this now
in for our concentration

00:29:33.070 --> 00:29:35.130
of the intermediate.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:43.600
And so now we get 2 times K1 K2
O2 NO squared over K minus 1.

00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.610
Or we could just put that with
the big equilibrium constant

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:50.560
and get rid of our
little K1 over K minus 1.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.920
Both of those are equivalent.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:59.340
And now we can take all of our
K terms and call them K obs.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.430
So K obs is just the
experimental rate constant.

00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:06.070
It's the collection of rate
constants that are measured.

00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:09.040
And we often-- when
we measure things,

00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.520
we can't distinguish K1 from K2.

00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.740
We sometimes try to
do that, and that's

00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:15.840
a little more complicated.

00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:17.980
But in this case,
all that was given

00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:20.850
was an overall K observed.

00:30:20.850 --> 00:30:27.310
And this was our experimental
rate law K observed times O2

00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.560
first order NO second order.

00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:34.210
And now we see this expression
agrees with this rate.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.170
So the fact that we
have a good agreement

00:30:37.170 --> 00:30:42.100
means that a mechanism with this
fast reversible step followed

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:46.110
by a slow step gives
rise to a rate law that's

00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:47.600
consistent with experiment.

00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.510
It doesn't prove that's
the right mechanism.

00:30:49.510 --> 00:30:52.680
It's very hard to prove
mechanisms are right,

00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.630
but at least it's consistent.

00:30:54.630 --> 00:30:59.290
So we can say this is a
good guess, a good proposal,

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.110
for our mechanism.

00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.578
So let's look at
another example.

00:31:08.430 --> 00:31:11.570
So in this example
we have NO again.

00:31:11.570 --> 00:31:13.940
We have two molecules
of NO, and now we

00:31:13.940 --> 00:31:18.500
have Br2 going to two
molecules of NOBr.

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.660
And we're told that the
experimental rate is

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:27.610
K obs times NO first
order, Br2 first order

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:31.310
and asked, for this
proposed mechanism,

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:35.440
which would be the
slow step to give rise

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.050
to that experimental data?

00:31:39.050 --> 00:31:42.290
So the first thing that we would
want to do with all of these

00:31:42.290 --> 00:31:48.400
is to write the rate laws
for each individual step.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.290
So for the forward step
we have one molecule

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:58.420
of NO reacting with Br2
with rate constant K2.

00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:03.560
So we get rate constant K1 times
the concentration of NO times

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:05.650
the concentration of Br2.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.580
Again, this is a step or
an elementary reaction,

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:13.960
so we write the rate law just
based on the stoichiometry

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:15.610
here.

00:32:15.610 --> 00:32:19.210
Now we can do the same
thing for the reverse rate.

00:32:19.210 --> 00:32:23.570
So we have K minus 1
times the concentration

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:26.330
of our intermediate.

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:30.320
So in step two our intermediate,
which is formed in step one,

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.460
is reacting with the
second molecule NO,

00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:35.680
forming our product.

00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:38.630
And we can write the
rate for this as well.

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:43.520
K2 times the concentration
of our intermediate, NOBr2,

00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.700
times the concentration of NO.

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.440
So again, these are steps.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:49.460
They're elementary
reactions so we

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:52.600
can write the rate law
based on the stoichiometry

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.820
in that proposed step.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:32:59.620
So now we can write
the overall rate law

00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:02.380
for the formation of
NOBr, and we can just

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:04.860
write it from the second
step like we did before.

00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.020
Again, this is an example.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:07.820
We're forming two
molecules of product

00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:09.260
so there's a two in there.

00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:10.900
We have K2.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.130
It's basically just this.

00:33:12.130 --> 00:33:15.800
K2 times our
intermediate, NOBr2,

00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:18.370
times the concentration of NO.

00:33:18.370 --> 00:33:21.450
But once again, we're
not done because there

00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:23.780
is an intermediate
in the expression

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.710
and you can't have an
intermediate in your rate law.

00:33:26.710 --> 00:33:31.180
You need to solve for the rate
law in terms of rate constants,

00:33:31.180 --> 00:33:33.530
reactants, and products.

00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:37.360
So we need to now solve
for our intermediate

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:40.550
in terms of things that are
allowed in the overall rate

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:42.080
law.

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.420
And so we want to
think again about what

00:33:44.420 --> 00:33:49.480
is the change in concentration
of our intermediate

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.550
So we can do the same
thing that we did before?

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:56.960
So the intermediate is being
formed in the first step.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.440
So we have the rate
law for the first step.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:07.480
K1 times NO times the
concentration of Br2.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:13.120
The intermediate is also
decaying in the reverse part

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.429
of the first step.

00:34:15.429 --> 00:34:20.920
So that's minus the reverse
rate minus K minus 1 times

00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.540
the intermediate here.

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:27.020
And then it's being
consumed in the second step.

00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:32.870
So it's going away by the rate
K2 times the concentration

00:34:32.870 --> 00:34:36.610
of the intermediate times
the concentration of NO.

00:34:36.610 --> 00:34:40.040
So again, this is exactly what
we did with the first example.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:43.480
We think about the change,
how it's being formed,

00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.679
and the two different ways
that it's being consumed.

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:51.159
We can again use a steady
state approximation

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:55.730
and set all of that equal to 0.

00:34:55.730 --> 00:35:00.920
So let's do that and we'll solve
again for the intermediate.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.150
So on this next slide now-- I
just put those things up there.

00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:06.980
This is what you were
just copying down.

00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.810
If you didn't finish
it's still here.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:12.290
And here is the steady
state approximation.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:14.170
So again, the steady
straight approximation

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.480
is the net rate of formation
of your intermediate

00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:18.940
equals the net rate
of it's going away.

00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:21.190
Net rate is 0.

00:35:21.190 --> 00:35:25.150
So rearranging then we can
bring the two terms that

00:35:25.150 --> 00:35:29.380
involve the decay
or the consumption

00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:32.720
of our intermediate on one
side and then set them equal

00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:35.910
to the rate at which that
intermediate is formed.

00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:39.370
And then, we can pull out our
terms for our intermediate.

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:45.882
So we pull out NoBr2, leaving
K minus 1, leaving K2 and NO,

00:35:45.882 --> 00:35:51.020
and set it equal to the
rate law for the first step

00:35:51.020 --> 00:35:52.970
in the forward direction.

00:35:52.970 --> 00:35:54.670
We can solve for
the intermediate.

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:57.180
Take this, divide
it by this term.

00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.500
So we have K1 times
NO times Br2 over K

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:04.540
minus 1 plus K2 times NO.

00:36:04.540 --> 00:36:05.900
Now we can take this.

00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.210
We are done solving
for our intermediate.

00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:10.730
We have no more
intermediates in there,

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:13.790
so we can now plug this
back in to the expression we

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:15.080
had before.

00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:19.360
So we can take this,
plug it in here,

00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:21.460
and that gives us
this formation.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:28.540
So we have 2 times K1, NO times
NO-- NO squared-- Br2 on top,

00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:32.398
K minus 1 on the bottom
plus K2 times NO.

00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.030
Now we were asked,
what are the fast

00:36:38.030 --> 00:36:39.840
and what are the slow steps?

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.410
So now we want to take
this and think about,

00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:45.470
if there's different
fast and slow steps,

00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:49.520
is it consistent then
with the experiment?

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:54.110
So first, let's consider
if the first step was slow

00:36:54.110 --> 00:36:58.250
and the second step
was fast-- or i.e.,

00:36:58.250 --> 00:37:03.860
if we have K2 NO
greater than K minus 1.

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.280
And this is a clicker question,
so why don't you tell me how

00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.820
this then, using this, changes?

00:37:27.730 --> 00:37:28.230
OK.

00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.780
10 seconds.

00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:44.870
OK.

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:49.690
Let's now think about
why that's true.

00:37:49.690 --> 00:37:54.430
This involved doing a couple
of steps in your head.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:57.700
So if we have a first
step that's slow

00:37:57.700 --> 00:38:00.370
and a second step that's
fast, the second step

00:38:00.370 --> 00:38:03.940
involves the K2 times
the concentration of NO.

00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:04.920
That's the second step.

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:05.860
That's fast.

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:09.020
That's going to be a big
number compared to K minus 1.

00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:11.710
So if we look, both
are on the bottom here.

00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:14.810
And if this term, K2
NO, is much, much bigger

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:20.770
than K minus 1, then we
can say K minus 1 goes way.

00:38:20.770 --> 00:38:25.120
If we get rid of K
minus 1, we can simplify

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:27.070
the expression even more.

00:38:27.070 --> 00:38:30.820
We can get rid of our
K2s and we can get rid

00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.745
of one of our NOs,
which gives us this.

00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.300
So saying that the
first step is slow

00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.130
and the second step
is fast gives us

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:44.620
a very different equation.

00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.420
A lot of things cancel out.

00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:51.240
So we can also write
that expression as K

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:56.050
obs times NO times Br2.

00:38:56.050 --> 00:39:02.000
And the overall order of
that reaction would be what?

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.226
Yell it out.

00:39:04.226 --> 00:39:05.170
AUDIENCE: Two.

00:39:05.170 --> 00:39:07.090
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yes.

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:10.030
So this is what we would get
for a first step that's slow;

00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:11.860
second step that's fast.

00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:16.450
Now let's consider if
the first step is fast

00:39:16.450 --> 00:39:19.300
and the second step is slow.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:22.510
So if the first step is
fast that means K minus 1,

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.000
the rate constant
for the reverse step,

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.910
is going to be a lot
bigger than K2 times NO.

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:32.530
And so now we can look
up at this expression

00:39:32.530 --> 00:39:35.890
and say, OK, if this is
much bigger than this

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:38.710
then that cancels out.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:41.890
And then we're left
with this expression,

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.410
which I can put down here.

00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:48.190
So that leaves us-- we can't
cancel any more at this point.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:51.190
So that leaves us
with 2 times K1 times

00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:57.950
K2-- these-- NO squared
Br2 over K minus 1.

00:39:57.950 --> 00:40:01.390
So assuming different things
about how fast and slow

00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:06.070
the steps are gives you
very different rate laws.

00:40:06.070 --> 00:40:08.890
We can also write that to
make it look a little simpler

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:14.530
as K obs, but you'll note
that the overall order is

00:40:14.530 --> 00:40:15.560
very different.

00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:18.330
So what's the
overall order here?

00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:19.000
Three.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.080
Right.

00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:25.060
So let's remind ourselves what
the experimental rate law was.

00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.380
And it was NO first
order Br2 first order.

00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:35.170
So that means that this
one would be consistent.

00:40:35.170 --> 00:40:40.210
So the mechanism is likely
to involve a slow first step

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:42.670
and a fast second step.

00:40:42.670 --> 00:40:45.400
And so that's how you do
a lot of these problems.

00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:47.830
You think about what is
going to change when you have

00:40:47.830 --> 00:40:50.350
different fast and slow steps.

00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:52.150
One of them will
be more consistent

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:54.310
with the experimental
data and one of them

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.210
will not be consistent.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:01.690
OK Let's do one
more fast example.

00:41:01.690 --> 00:41:07.720
Here we have rate law for two
molecules of ozone O3 going

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:11.010
to three molecules of O2.

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:14.290
And ozone has been in
the news a lot recently.

00:41:14.290 --> 00:41:17.020
So we want to keep
our ozone layer.

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:21.070
We don't want it to go away.

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:25.690
So we have O3
going to O2 plus O,

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:28.450
and you're forming
an intermediate O.

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:33.010
That intermediate is
reacting with O3, forming

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.510
our two molecules of O2.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.130
So let's just write
out what our rate

00:41:39.130 --> 00:41:41.270
is for the forward reaction.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:47.430
So we have K1 times the
concentration of O3.

00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:53.770
For the reverse we have K
minus 1 times concentration

00:41:53.770 --> 00:41:59.120
of O2 times the concentration
of our intermediate O.

00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.860
For the next one we have
K2 times our intermediate O

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.640
times the concentration of O3.

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:09.400
So now we're told that
there's a fast reversible step

00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.300
and a slow step.

00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:15.650
So the rate will be
determined by the slow step.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.420
So we can write out the
rate of formation of O2

00:42:19.420 --> 00:42:21.160
based on the slow
step, which happens

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.770
to be the second step, which
is what we've done all along.

00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.560
So there's not really a
huge change right now.

00:42:26.560 --> 00:42:29.230
So the formation-- again,
two molecules of O2

00:42:29.230 --> 00:42:31.090
were formed so we have a 2.

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:33.100
We have K2 times
the concentration

00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.120
of our intermediate O times
the concentration of O3.

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.910
But again, O is an
intermediate so we

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.640
need to solve for it in
terms of our products

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:45.310
reactants of rate constants.

00:42:45.310 --> 00:42:48.730
But now we're told something
about fast and slow steps

00:42:48.730 --> 00:42:51.250
right up front.

00:42:51.250 --> 00:42:53.560
And so if we have a
fast reversible step

00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:56.260
followed by a slow
step, how can we

00:42:56.260 --> 00:42:58.990
solve for our concentration
of our intermediate

00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.660
in a simpler way than
we've been doing?

00:43:01.660 --> 00:43:04.000
What do we use?

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.874
Or what can we use?

00:43:05.874 --> 00:43:07.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.900
CATHERINE DRENNAN: We can use
the equilibrium expression.

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:12.130
So we can put that in.

00:43:12.130 --> 00:43:15.070
We can say our equilibrium
expression products

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:20.020
over reactants equals
little K1 over K minus 1,

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.260
or equilibrium constant K1.

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:29.380
Solve for O and get either
big equilibrium constant K1

00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:33.070
or our little rate
constant K1 over K minus 1,

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:36.130
and we have O3 over O2 here.

00:43:36.130 --> 00:43:39.820
So this was a lot simpler
than doing all of that.

00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:42.760
So again, if you have a fast
reversible step followed

00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:45.460
by a slow step you can
solve for the concentration

00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:48.160
of your intermediate using an
equilibrium expression which

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.660
you all know how to write.

00:43:49.660 --> 00:43:51.610
So that makes your life easier.

00:43:51.610 --> 00:43:54.610
Then we can substitute
that back in

00:43:54.610 --> 00:43:58.810
and we are able
to put this back.

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:02.200
And we'll solve it for O
and we'll plug in our K1

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.390
over K minus 1.

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:04.330
O3.

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.300
We had an O3.

00:44:05.300 --> 00:44:06.680
So that's squared over O2.

00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:14.650
Or we could write that in
terms of K obs O3 concentration

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:17.710
to the 2 over O2.

00:44:17.710 --> 00:44:21.550
So let's end with some
fun, thinking about what

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.440
we would observe here.

00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:24.940
First, the order
and then what would

00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:26.980
happen if we double things.

00:44:26.980 --> 00:44:29.800
So what is the order
with respect to O3?

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.196
You can yell that out.

00:44:31.196 --> 00:44:32.340
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:33.298
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Yup.

00:44:33.298 --> 00:44:36.256
What is the order for O2?

00:44:36.256 --> 00:44:38.852
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:38.852 --> 00:44:40.060
CATHERINE DRENNAN: Oh, sorry.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:40.990
I had something here.

00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:42.700
Double this what happens?

00:44:42.700 --> 00:44:44.024
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:44.024 --> 00:44:45.190
CATHERINE DRENNAN: The rate.

00:44:45.190 --> 00:44:46.930
Well, four times.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:47.720
Order here.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.750
Some people yelled it out.

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:50.260
Oh, no.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:50.760
Oh, man.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.760
It's a clicker question.

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.009
I forgot about that.

00:44:53.009 --> 00:44:53.550
Don't listen.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:55.675
But luckily, everyone yelled
out different answers.

00:45:06.071 --> 00:45:06.570
All right.

00:45:06.570 --> 00:45:07.433
10 more seconds.

00:45:22.210 --> 00:45:23.440
OK.

00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:24.730
Yup.

00:45:24.730 --> 00:45:27.760
So it's minus 1.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:31.090
And so if you double
it, it will half.

00:45:31.090 --> 00:45:36.910
And then finally, the overall
order would be 1 because again,

00:45:36.910 --> 00:45:39.010
the overall order is the sum.

00:45:39.010 --> 00:45:41.950
So 2 minus 1 is 1.

00:45:41.950 --> 00:45:45.415
And last clicker question.

00:45:56.070 --> 00:45:56.570
All right.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.760
10 more seconds.

00:45:58.760 --> 00:46:01.370
I know you're really in a hurry
to do those extra problems

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:03.480
for exam four.

00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.300
I'm the rate determining step.

00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.430
I am with my clicker question.

00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:09.495
I admit it.

00:46:09.495 --> 00:46:11.037
AUDIENCE: Yay.

00:46:11.037 --> 00:46:12.245
CATHERINE DRENNAN: All right.

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:15.290
All right.

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:16.100
See you Wednesday.

00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.890
Remember, final
clicker competition

00:46:18.890 --> 00:46:22.430
of the year before the finals.

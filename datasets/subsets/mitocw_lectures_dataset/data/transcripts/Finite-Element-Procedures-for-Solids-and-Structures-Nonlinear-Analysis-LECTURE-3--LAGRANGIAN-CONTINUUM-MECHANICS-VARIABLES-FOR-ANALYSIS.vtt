00:00:20.956 --> 00:00:23.650
PROFESSOR: Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to this

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.600
lecture on non-linear finite
element analysis.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.320
In the previous lectures, I
introduced you to non-linear

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.810
finite element analysis, to
the solution methods that

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.980
we're using in non-linear finite
element analysis, using

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.250
primarily physical concepts.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.290
We are now ready to discuss the
mathematical basis of the

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.790
procedures that we're using
to obtain solutions.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.830
Of course, this material is very
complex, and there is a

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.580
lot we could discuss.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.530
But let us have a go at it.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.470
We have a body that undergoes
large displacements, large

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.720
rotations, and large strains.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.940
So therefore, we consider
the body to

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.210
undergo very large motions.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.940
We will use a Lagrangian
description of the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.190
motion of the body.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.560
Here, on this viewgraph, I have
prepared schematically

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.500
the body that we
are looking at.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.730
Here the body is in its
configuration at time zero.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.710
Notice that the area is, the
surface area of the body is

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.980
described as 0 A, the volume
is described as 0 V, the 0

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.870
being a left superscript.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.390
I should point out, at this
point, that you will be

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.610
encountering now a lot of
superscripts and subscripts,

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.740
and that actually makes the
discussion somewhat difficult.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.210
And for that reason, I like to
take now, on this viewgraph,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.190
just a minute to explain to you
why we have a particular

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.200
superscript, a particular
subscript, in that particular

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.930
location, and what
it means to us.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:09.199
So, a left superscript here, as
shown on A and V, means at

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:12.470
time indicated by that, at the
time indicated by that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.210
superscript.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:20.270
So here we have 0 A, 0 V once
again, area at time 0,

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.520
volume at time 0.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.160
A particular point here, point
P, has the coordinates 0 X 1,

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:32.250
0 X 2, 0 X 3.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.960
Now, notice that these upper
0s here correspond to the

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.250
time, as I just pointed out,
whereas 1, 2, and 3, of

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.420
course, correspond to
the coordinate axis.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.940
This is a particular
material particle.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.970
This material particle will move
with the body from time 0

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.680
to time t as shown on
this viewgraph.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.820
Of course, at this particular
time now, the surface area of

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.780
the body has become t A,
t now meaning surface

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.170
area at time t.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.290
And the volume of the body
is t V. Notice that the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.142
coordinates of this material
particle now are t x

00:03:15.142 --> 00:03:18.870
1, t x 2, t x 3.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.960
We will assume, later on in our
actual solution, that the

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.970
solution up to time t is known,
in other words, that

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.080
the area, the volume, in fact,
the stresses, the strains, at

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.380
time t are known.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.870
And that we will want to march
ahead one time increment, to

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.770
time, t plus delta t.

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.450
Notice the volume of the body,
now, is given by t plus delta

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.730
t V. The surface area is given
by t plus delta t A. The

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.590
coordinates of the material
particle have now become t

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:58.460
plus delta t x 1, t plus delta t
x 2, and t plus delta t x 3.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.090
Well, there's one very
important point.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.540
And that important point is that
we are considering that

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:10.500
the Cartesian coordinate axis
in which the motion of the

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.650
body is measured remains
stationary.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.260
You should always keep
that in mind.

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.940
In other words, here we have the
Cartesian axis, x 1, x 2,

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.250
x 3, and those remain
stationary, whereas the body

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.540
moves through those axes,
through the, well, system of

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:37.700
axes, And we want to, of course,
solve for that motion.

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.420
With the particle motion
described by the coordinates

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:46.510
that I just mentioned, we can
now define the following

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.370
quantities down here.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.890
We can say that t x i, the
coordinates at time t of the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:58.370
material particle, are
equal to 0 x i--

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.660
both of those quantities, of
course, we know already now

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.310
what they are--

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.720
plus t u i.

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.040
t u i are just the displacements
from

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.800
time 0 to time t.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.660
Similarly for the situation
from time 0 to time

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:14.670
t plus delta t.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:18.640
Notice that these are now the
displacements from time 0 to

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.950
time t plus delta t.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.140
And we can, of course, talk
also about the incremental

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.840
displacements.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.620
The incremental displacements
from time t plus delta t, or

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.190
rather from time t, I should
say, to time t plus delta t.

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:34.840
And those incremental
displacements

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.450
are given by u i.

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.730
Of course, the lower right
subscript always

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.260
refers to the axis.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.410
In other words, i goes from
one to two to three.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.390
For the u's and for the x's.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.670
Well, I mentioned already that
the Cartesian axes are

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:57.940
stationary.

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.380
And I have prepared this
viewgraph to point it out once

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.680
more very strongly.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.236
The unit distances along the
xi-axis are the same for 0 x

00:06:08.236 --> 00:06:12.610
i, t x i, and t plus
delta t x i.

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.560
That is also a very
important point.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.100
Let's look at this very
simple example.

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.732
Here we have an x 2- axis,
and we have the x

00:06:20.732 --> 00:06:24.070
1-axis along here.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.570
Notice the units along this axis
are 1, 2, 3, and so on.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.670
The material particle
has initially the

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.640
coordinates, 2, say.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.450
Of course, then, this being
the length of 0 x 1.

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:45.920
This particle, at time 0, moves
to time t by t u 1, the

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.600
way we just said it earlier.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.640
And of course, the sum of
these two quantities is

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.890
equal to t x 1.

00:06:54.510 --> 00:07:00.160
Notice that t x 1 is measured
along the same axis, with the

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:05.600
same unit distances, as 0 x 1.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.200
And therefore, for this reason,
we now use just x 1

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.410
here, without the left
superscript, to denote the

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:13.980
coordinate axis.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.620
By the way, in my book, the
textbook for this video

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:20.620
course, I have frequently
put here, a t or 0.

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:23.200
I feel now, it is better,
actually, to drop that

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:26.560
superscript, because this
description, the way I just

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.110
explained it to you, I think,
is even better.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.960
Well, let us talk now,
then, about the

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.410
principle of virtual work.

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:38.570
And now, we want to look at the
principle of virtual work

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:41.700
applied to time t
plus delta t.

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.510
The reason being, of course,
that we want to solve for the

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:49.370
static and kinematic variables
at time t plus delta t.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.400
We assume that we know
the solution from

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.050
time 0 to time t.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.830
We discussed in the previous

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.780
lectures already the principle.

00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.090
I'd like to now just review it
once more, because it's just

00:08:03.090 --> 00:08:07.720
of utmost importance to very
well grasp, understand what

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.930
the principle says, and
how we apply it then.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.980
Here we have now the
Cauchy stresses.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:15.830
I defined the Cauchy stresses
earlier as the

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.930
force per unit area.

00:08:17.930 --> 00:08:22.580
The i j, of course, mean
coordinate axis, i and j.

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:25.930
In three dimensional analysis,
going from 1 to 3.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.890
t plus delta t means the
Cauchy stress at time

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:30.350
t plus delta t.

00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:34.530
These are the real stresses
that we want to solve for.

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:38.159
Here we have virtual strains.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:43.770
These are infinitesimally small
strains, referred to the

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.050
configuration at time
t plus delta t.

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.750
This t plus delta t means a
reference to the configuration

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.480
at time t plus delta t.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.270
And here we have, of course,
the t plus delta t d V,

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:01.190
because we're integrating over
that volume which, of course,

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.160
is unknown in the incremental
solution.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.920
This is the internet virtual
work, which must be equal to

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.480
the external virtual work.

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:14.510
Here is again, the script R. And
this script R, at time t

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:18.500
plus delta t, is defined down
here in the viewgraph.

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:21.860
We're integrating over the
volume, at time t plus delta

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.750
t, the body forces.

00:09:24.750 --> 00:09:27.910
And these are the real body
forces, of forces per unit

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:32.640
volume at time t plus delta t,
multiplied by the virtual

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.490
displacements, delta u i.

00:09:36.490 --> 00:09:39.830
And the integration, of course,
goes over the volume

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:41.730
at time t plus delta t.

00:09:41.730 --> 00:09:48.600
We're adding to this part the
surface forces, forces per

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.060
unit area, at time t plus delta
t, multiplied by the

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:56.160
virtual displacements
on the surface.

00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:02.670
This capital S stands for "on
the surface." And this product

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:07.050
is integrated over the total
surface of the body at time t

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:09.370
plus delta t.

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:14.520
We assume that we know this part
once we have imposed a

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.410
virtual displacement.

00:10:17.410 --> 00:10:21.580
And therefore, we can calculate
the right-hand side.

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:23.960
Corresponding to that virtual
displacement we

00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:27.410
obtain virtual strains.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.080
And therefore, we can
calculate also

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:31.320
the left-hand side.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.890
And once again, the principle of
virtual work says, that the

00:10:34.890 --> 00:10:38.460
left-hand side, the internal
virtual work, must be equal to

00:10:38.460 --> 00:10:42.510
the right-hand side, the
external virtual work, for any

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:45.880
arbitrary virtual displacements
that satisfy the

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:48.050
displacement boundary
conditions.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.820
Of course, remember, as I
pointed out earlier, in an

00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:54.070
earlier lecture, that the
virtual strains must

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.480
correspond to the virtual
displacements.

00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.040
And here we have the virtual
strains, once again.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:06.530
On the viewgraph we saw this
stress, and I call it the

00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:07.850
Cauchy stress.

00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:09.580
Here, you have it spelled
out once more.

00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.910
It's the force per unit area
at time t plus delta t.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.330
We also talked about the
virtual strains.

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:20.580
And the virtual strains here,
this was the quantity R,

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:22.790
defined as shown on the
right-hand side.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:26.170
Let me once again point strongly
out that we are

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.320
differentiating here, with
respect to the coordinates, at

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.490
time t plus delta t.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.710
Of course, the j and
the i coordinate.

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:38.910
And also, please recognize that
this strain is really the

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:43.000
infinitesimal strain tensor
that you are very well

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.470
familiar with in infinitesimal
analysis, in infinitesimal

00:11:46.470 --> 00:11:51.140
displacement analysis, I should
say, except for one

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:54.020
difference that we're using
here, the unknown coordinates

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.650
at time t plus delta t.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:02.260
And that is spelled out down
here, that we are using a

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.470
variation in the small strains
referred to the configuration,

00:12:05.470 --> 00:12:07.340
at time t plus delta t.

00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.000
So really, if you are familiar
with the principle of virtual

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:14.820
work, as applied in
infinitesimal displacement

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:20.080
analysis, then you recognize
that the principle of virtual

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.980
work now applied to large
deformation analysis, large

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:28.955
displacement analysis, is quite
the same, except that we

00:12:28.955 --> 00:12:32.020
are applying it to the current
geometry, the current

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:36.060
configuration of the body.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:41.150
In my textbook, actually, I have
a little note, a footnote

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:45.160
that you might also look at,
in the beginning of Chapter

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:48.570
Six, where I discuss this
principle of virtual work,

00:12:48.570 --> 00:12:52.980
that one way to look at it is
that you see a body and, you

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.900
see the body in front of
yourself moving through the

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.820
stationary coordinate frame--

00:12:57.820 --> 00:13:00.130
once again, the Cartesian
coordinate frame is

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:01.380
stationary.

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.920
You see it move, you see the
body move through that

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:05.180
coordinate frame.

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:08.050
And there is somebody standing,
taking a picture.

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:11.190
And that picture is taken
at time t plus delta t.

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.990
And now you have a picture.

00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:16.320
And you apply the principle
of virtual work to that

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.860
particular configuration
which has been

00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:20.930
captured in that picture.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:24.030
That's perhaps one way to look
at it, at least one way that I

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.280
like to look at it.

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.230
In order to solve, or to work
with the principal of virtual

00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.320
work, you need to rewrite the
principal, really, because we

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.640
cannot integrate over an unknown
volume, and we cannot

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:44.090
directly work with increments
in the Cauchy stresses.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:47.760
The volume t plus delta t,
remember, is unknown.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:52.150
And the reason why we cannot
directly work, or simply work

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.740
with increments in Cauchy
stresses is because a Cauchy

00:13:54.740 --> 00:14:00.380
stress is always referred to the
current geometry, current

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.490
configuration.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:05.005
So if we talk about the Cauchy
stress at time t, then it's

00:14:05.005 --> 00:14:08.200
the force per unit
area at time t.

00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.440
And the Cauchy stress at time
t plus delta t is the force

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.260
per unit area at time
t plus delta t.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:19.290
Now you can't add a quantity
that is referred to time t to

00:14:19.290 --> 00:14:22.010
a quality that is referred to
time t plus delta t, because

00:14:22.010 --> 00:14:25.430
the areas, the reference
areas, have changed.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:28.590
And we have to somehow take
care of that in our

00:14:28.590 --> 00:14:29.790
formulation.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:33.090
And for that reason, we
introduce these two new

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:34.210
quantities.

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:39.720
The t 0 s is the 2nd
Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.680
And the t 0 epsilon is the
Green-Lagrange strain tensor.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:47.180
We introduce these quantities
because these are well known

00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:47.840
quantities.

00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.810
If you were to look into
continuum mechanics texts,

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:55.790
they have been described
in many, many books.

00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:58.520
And they are well known
for some time.

00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:02.530
But we have extracted,
basically, this information

00:15:02.530 --> 00:15:05.660
from the continuum mechanics
literature, because it's a

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:08.680
convenient, these are convenient
stress and strain

00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:12.170
measures to work with in
large deformation,

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.200
finite element analysis.

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.190
So, this is the stress
and that is the

00:15:17.190 --> 00:15:18.600
strain we will be using.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.750
And let me say the
following now.

00:15:20.750 --> 00:15:28.160
This t here, the upper t, means
stress at time t, in the

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.000
configuration at time t.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.570
This lower 0 means that the
stress is referred to the

00:15:34.570 --> 00:15:37.520
configuration at time 0.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.980
Similarly for the Green-Lagrange
strain.

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:44.890
Upper left, the configuration in
which the strain, or stress

00:15:44.890 --> 00:15:52.300
measure is measured, and the
lower subscript means, to

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:55.470
which the configuration,
to which the

00:15:55.470 --> 00:15:58.020
measure is referred to.

00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:01.280
So this is something to keep
in mind, because we will be

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:04.240
encountering this quite a bit.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:10.080
Here is the definition of the
stress tensor, t 0 s i j.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.250
Once again, the stress in
configuration t, referred to

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.570
the configuration at time 0.

00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:19.320
i j, of course, being the
Cartesian coordinate

00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:20.740
components.

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.870
Here we have the mass
density ratio.

00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:29.400
The mass density at time 0, in
configuration 0, if you like.

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:34.630
The mass density at time t, in
configuration at time t.

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.510
And here we have a new quantity,
which is actually

00:16:39.510 --> 00:16:41.700
the inverse of the deformation
gradient.

00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:43.785
This is a component
of the inverse of

00:16:43.785 --> 00:16:44.880
the deformation gradient.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.890
We will talk about this quantity
quite a bit just now.

00:16:48.890 --> 00:16:52.090
Here we have the
Cauchy stress.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:56.510
And here we have another
component such as that one.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.260
This is the 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff
stress.

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:02.780
Once again, I will talk about
this piece of information

00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.790
quite a bit just now.

00:17:04.790 --> 00:17:07.720
The Green-Lagrange strain tensor
is defined as shown

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:12.990
here, t 0 epsilon i j, i j, of
course, being the components

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:20.690
into the Cartesian coordinate
axes, 1/2 t 0 u i comma j plus

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:30.070
t zero u j comma i plus t 0 u k
comma i times t zero u k j.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:36.240
Notice that here we would select
a particular i and j,

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.110
say i equals 1, j equals 2.

00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:43.200
You would substitute those i and
j numbers in here, so to

00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.790
say, and here as well.

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.610
And notice that this k then,
would actually run over all

00:17:49.610 --> 00:17:50.750
possibilities.

00:17:50.750 --> 00:17:54.390
k going from 1, then
to 2, then to 3.

00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:57.920
In other words, there is a
summation involved here.

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:00.660
By the way, similarly, we have
a summation involved here,

00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:07.370
because m and n would run over
all the possibilities.

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:10.020
I will talk just now a little
bit more about it.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.950
But let's first now look at how
this particular piece of

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:16.610
information here is defined.

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:22.600
It's defined as a partial of 0
x i with respect to t x m.

00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:26.200
Notice that this coordinate,
of course, is given, is

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:27.990
assumed to be given.

00:18:27.990 --> 00:18:30.590
And that one here is also
now assumed to be given.

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.930
Notice, of course, that t x
m is equal to 0 x m plus a

00:18:35.930 --> 00:18:38.720
displacement that
has occurred.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.390
Notice that this differentiation
here is

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:46.300
defined as given here, partial
t u i with respect to the

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:48.170
original coordinates.

00:18:48.170 --> 00:18:53.300
So, this lower 0 here, this
lower 0 here refers to the

00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:55.690
fact that we're differentiating
with respect

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.670
to the original coordinates.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:19:02.450
This upper t here means that
we are differentiating the

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.610
displacement at time t.

00:19:04.610 --> 00:19:08.450
Notice, of course, that i and
j are dummy indices here.

00:19:08.450 --> 00:19:11.740
So, in fact, this one here
is what I'm considering.

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:14.240
But at the same time, I'm
considering that one, if I

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.100
just switch around i and j.

00:19:18.670 --> 00:19:22.370
So these are the definitions
of these two quantities.

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:25.710
And I mentioned briefly already
that we are summing in

00:19:25.710 --> 00:19:26.980
these definitions.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:32.050
For example, t s 1 1 would be
calculated from the formulas

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:34.650
that I gave you as 0
rho over t rho--

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:37.480
this, of course, is a scalar--

00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:41.220
times this product here.

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:42.270
What do we do here?

00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:47.140
We are selecting the
1 as that 1 here.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:50.980
That 1 here refers to that 1.

00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:54.880
And then we are letting these
components here, these

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:58.180
components here, and that one
here, run over all the

00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.050
possibilities.

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:01.900
Notice, here we have 1 2.

00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.950
That is this 1 here,
and that 1, 2.

00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:09.660
And here we have
3, 3 3, and 3.

00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:13.440
So in other words, these
first two are fixed.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:17.290
These first two here are fixed,
this 1 and that 1.

00:20:17.290 --> 00:20:20.200
They correspond to this
1, to these two 1s.

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.570
But the other components vary
over all the possibilities,

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:26.690
namely, 1, to 2, to 3.

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:28.740
This is here the summation
convention, which is

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:30.980
abundantly used in continuum
mechanics.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.290
And you might be very well
familiar with it.

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:38.050
Using this 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff
stress and Green-Lagrange

00:20:38.050 --> 00:20:39.630
strain tensors--

00:20:39.630 --> 00:20:42.220
and that is really the important
point now-- we can

00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:49.820
rewrite the basic equation of
the principle of virtual work

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:51.770
in the form given here.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:55.590
Here on the left-hand side, we
have the Cauchy stresses times

00:20:55.590 --> 00:21:01.080
the variations on the
infinitesimal strains, or the

00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:06.210
small, infinitesimally virtual
small strains.

00:21:06.210 --> 00:21:10.160
We integrate this product
over the current volume.

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.970
And we mentioned already that
we cannot deal with this

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:15.090
integration very well.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:19.250
Well, we now rewrite, we can
rewrite this integral as shown

00:21:19.250 --> 00:21:23.800
here, 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff
stresses times variations in

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.760
the Green-Lagrange strains.

00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:30.070
And we integrate this, we are
integrating this product over

00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:32.370
the original volume
of the body.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:33.580
And that is the clue.

00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:35.540
We know this volume.

00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:38.120
We asked in general,
increment analysis.

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:43.560
We would not know this volume
if, for example, we only have

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.840
calculated the response
up to t minus delta t.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:55.070
So, if we know this volume we
can directly deal with this

00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:56.270
integration.

00:21:56.270 --> 00:21:59.030
And we will see also that since
these stress components

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:03.410
are always referred to the same
volume, the same area, we

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:06.170
can also incrementally decompose
these stresses.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.480
And the same holds
for the strains.

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:12.615
Notice this relation, of course,
holds for all times,

00:22:12.615 --> 00:22:16.560
delta t, 2 delta t,
t, t plus delta t.

00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:18.960
The way we talked about the
principal of virtual work just

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.160
now, we really had, on the
left-hand side here,

00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.810
t plus delta t.

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:29.360
Well, you would just exchange
this t, that t, and that t,

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:32.480
and that t here, to
a t plus delta t.

00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:36.950
And similarly, of course, on the
right-hand side as well.

00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:40.670
I chose at the preparation of
the viewgraph to simply call

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.910
it t, because after all, this
equation holds anyways, for

00:22:44.910 --> 00:22:47.110
any of those particular times.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:52.350
To develop, then, the
incremental finite element

00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:55.680
equations, we use the
principle of virtual

00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.940
work in this form.

00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:02.130
If we assume that at, that the
response has been calculated

00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:07.630
from time 0 to time t, we apply
the principle of virtual

00:23:07.630 --> 00:23:12.040
work at time t plus delta t.

00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:14.200
We integrate, now, over
a known volume,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.380
as I pointed out.

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:21.560
And, we can directly decompose
the stresses at time t plus

00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:26.380
delta t, and the Green-Lagrange
strains at time

00:23:26.380 --> 00:23:30.770
t plus delta t as shown
in these equations.

00:23:30.770 --> 00:23:33.950
Now, notice that here we have
the stress at time t plus

00:23:33.950 --> 00:23:39.820
delta t referred to the
configuration at time 0 being

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:43.580
equal to the stress at time t
referred to the configuration

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.380
at time 0 plus an incremental
that is also

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:48.790
referred to time 0.

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:52.250
And this is what we
would like to see.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.150
Similarly for the Green-Lagrange
strain.

00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:59.650
These two items make if for us
possible to work very well

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:04.340
with the principle of virtual
work in this particular form.

00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:06.810
Before developing, however,
the incremental continuum

00:24:06.810 --> 00:24:10.910
mechanics equations, I'd like
to discuss with you now some

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:15.840
important kinematic
relationships that we use in

00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:18.720
general non-linear analysis.

00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.510
The 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress
and Green-Lagrange strains

00:24:22.510 --> 00:24:28.610
have some very interesting,
properties that I think I'd

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:32.210
like to share with you
in a discussion.

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:37.540
To explain some of these
properties, we want to

00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:40.100
introduce the deformation
gradient tensor.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:44.910
The deformation gradient tensor
is actually something

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.680
very, very basic in continuum
mechanics.

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:52.040
And so, let us spend a little
bit of time on this tensor, to

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:56.190
get also a bit of a physical
feel for what it means, what

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:59.120
it stands for, and what
can we do with it.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:04.340
The tensor captures the
straining of the body and the

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.100
rotation of the body.

00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:09.120
And, as I mentioned, it is
really a very fundamental

00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:11.155
quantity used in continuum
mechanics.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:17.470
The definition of
the deformation

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.570
gradient is as follows.

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:27.070
Here, we have t 0 x being equal
to a matrix, a large

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:30.210
matrix, which, of course, is
written in a Cartesian

00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:32.320
coordinate system.

00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:35.770
And notice what we're doing in
the elements of that matrix.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:40.320
We take the partial of t x
1 with respect to 0 x 1.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:45.180
In other words, we're taking the
coordinates at time t and

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.490
differentiate them with respect
to the original

00:25:47.490 --> 00:25:48.690
coordinates.

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.020
Here, the 1 component with
respect to the 1 component.

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:57.210
Here, the t x 1 with respect
to the 0 x 2.

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:01.970
And, t x 1 with respect
to 0 x 3.

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.900
Like that, we get a three
by three matrix.

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:08.640
Using indicial notation, we can
simply say that an element

00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.440
of that matrix, t 0 X i j,
capital X, because the matrix

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:19.030
is defined as the capital t 0 X,
being equal partial of t X

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.700
i with respect to 0 x j.

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.930
Of course, i j are
those i j's here.

00:26:24.930 --> 00:26:28.340
And, you will also find in the
textbook the following

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.750
notation here, t 0 x i j.

00:26:31.750 --> 00:26:36.070
Notice, when I have a comma
here, we denote the

00:26:36.070 --> 00:26:40.850
differentiation by that comma,
and we use a little x.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:44.570
That is different from using
the capital X here, with no

00:26:44.570 --> 00:26:50.010
comma, because that capital X
simply denotes a component of,

00:26:50.010 --> 00:26:56.650
let's go up here once more,
the t 0 x of that matrix.

00:26:56.650 --> 00:27:00.090
So this is a mathematical
definition, really, of the

00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:01.670
deformation gradient.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:05.380
And notice that in order to
calculate the elements of this

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:11.620
matrix, of course what you need
to be given is this t x

00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:21.310
1, t x 2, t x 3, as a function
of 0 x 1, 0 x 2, and 0 x 3.

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:25.000
If you are given the deformation
field, t x i as a

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.600
function of the 0 x j's, then
you can calculate directly the

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.700
components of the three
by three matrix.

00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:38.770
Another way to write the
deformation gradient is via

00:27:38.770 --> 00:27:41.700
this equation.

00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:47.600
t 0 x can be written
as 0 del, del 0.

00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.790
This here is a gradient
operator.

00:27:49.790 --> 00:27:52.240
Let's look down here.

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:53.550
We have defined it here.

00:27:56.560 --> 00:28:00.410
Times t x, or this gradient
operator operates, I should

00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:06.230
say, on t x capital T. This
capital T means transposed.

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:12.640
And this t x capital T
is given right here.

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:17.130
Notice what we're listing in
this vector here now, in this

00:28:17.130 --> 00:28:21.390
row vector, are simply the
coordinates at time t, t x 1,

00:28:21.390 --> 00:28:24.330
t x 2, t x 3.

00:28:24.330 --> 00:28:26.630
Notice that there is
a transpose here.

00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:29.930
That transpose is simply
introduced to make sure that

00:28:29.930 --> 00:28:34.050
this right-hand side is equal to
what we have defined on the

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.220
previous viewgraph this to be.

00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:41.030
If you leave out that capital
T, you would not quite get

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:44.020
what we actually have defined
on the previous viewgraph.

00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:47.010
So that's why we put that
capital T in there.

00:28:47.010 --> 00:28:51.560
It would be a nice exercise
for you to just actually

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:55.600
substitute from here into there,
plug into there, and

00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.600
write out the three by three
matrix, to make sure that you

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:02.580
actually get what's given here
on the left-hand side the way

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:04.390
we defined it on the
previous viewgraph.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:10.230
The deformation gradient, as I
briefly mentioned, describes

00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:13.110
the deformations, the rotations,
and stretches of

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:14.880
the material fibers.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:17.340
Let's look at some
examples now.

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:24.010
For example, if we have d 0 x
here, that is the material

00:29:24.010 --> 00:29:26.780
fiber in its original
configuration.

00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:29.270
Of course, that original
configuration is going to be

00:29:29.270 --> 00:29:33.520
deformed, moved through the
stationary coordinate system.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.385
That fiber moves into
this situation here.

00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:39.560
It becomes d t x.

00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:44.745
The deformation gradient gives
us this element as a function

00:29:44.745 --> 00:29:48.740
of that element, as given
in this equation.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:54.980
In other words, d t x is equal
to t 0 x times d 0 x.

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:59.940
If you know this piece of
information, and you have

00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.920
calculated the deformation
gradient, you

00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.510
directly get d t x.

00:30:04.510 --> 00:30:07.993
That's what the deformation
gradient does for us.

00:30:07.993 --> 00:30:10.090
Well, an example.

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:13.700
It's always nice to look at some
examples to demonstrate

00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:16.780
what we mean by these
theoretical formulas.

00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:19.780
And here we have a very
simple example.

00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:22.070
It's a one dimensional
deformation.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:27.780
We start off with this piece
of material, a rectangular

00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.590
piece of material.

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:35.750
And that piece of material is
stretched out from time 0 to

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:39.680
time t into this red
configuration.

00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:43.660
Quite a bit of stretching, but
the motion is simple because

00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:46.810
it's a uni-axial motion.

00:30:46.810 --> 00:30:51.470
Notice, the original length of
this piece of material is 1,

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:56.160
and this side here
moves out 0.5.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.890
Of course, the material
particles here will move.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:03.550
For example, a particle that was
originally here, the black

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:08.480
little lines there, will move
over to the right, and it

00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.020
becomes this red little line.

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:16.230
This black line moves over
to become that red line.

00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:21.320
Notice the displacement of this
black line is given by

00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:24.240
this blue arrow here.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.710
This black line moves over to
there, and the displacement is

00:31:27.710 --> 00:31:31.340
given by that blue arrow.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:35.350
If we know the displacements of
all these particles here,

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:38.160
we know the deformation field.

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.620
Vice versa, if the deformation
field is given, and now we

00:31:41.620 --> 00:31:46.060
look at this equation here, we
know the displacements of all

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:47.320
of the particles along.

00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:51.040
And t x 1 is equal to 0 x
1 for this particular

00:31:51.040 --> 00:31:56.470
deformation field plus
0.5 0 x 1 squared.

00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:58.480
Let's look at what this means.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:02.710
It tells that if I plug in a
particular coordinate on the

00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:06.430
right-hand side of a material
particle in its original

00:32:06.430 --> 00:32:13.760
configuration, then I'm going to
get the final coordinate of

00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.860
that same material particle,
that same material particle.

00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:23.140
Well, the deformation gradient
is defined via this

00:32:23.140 --> 00:32:25.590
relationship, and it's
therefore given

00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:27.650
as 1 plus 0 x 1.

00:32:27.650 --> 00:32:31.590
Notice, we have only motion in
one direction, so we only

00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:32.870
calculate this one component.

00:32:35.850 --> 00:32:38.700
Let's consider, quite
physically, a material

00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:43.050
particle initially at
x 1 equals 0.8.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:46.610
In other words, x 1 is
this direction, 0 x

00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:49.790
1 is equal to 0.8.

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:53.920
Remember, x 1 just gives us
the coordinate direction.

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.850
We now put a 0 on it to signify
that 0.8 is the

00:32:57.850 --> 00:33:01.330
position of the particle
initially.

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:05.010
That particle moves with the
deformation field that I've

00:33:05.010 --> 00:33:13.670
been given to this point here,
and t x 1 is then 1.120.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:18.920
The same can, of course, be
repeated for an adjacent

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.480
material particle.

00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.210
In other words, let us look
now at a material particle

00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:26.620
that is just a little bit to the
right-hand side, namely 0

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:32.430
x 1 being 0.850, slightly to
the right-hand side of the

00:33:32.430 --> 00:33:34.660
other material particle
that we looked at.

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:37.690
This material particle, with the
deformation field that we

00:33:37.690 --> 00:33:43.410
have been prescribing, moves
to t x 1, this number here.

00:33:43.410 --> 00:33:48.870
We can now compute t 0 x 1 1,
the element of the deformation

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.610
gradient as this difference
here.

00:33:52.610 --> 00:33:54.870
And the numbers are
plugged in here.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.140
And we obtain 1.82.

00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:01.260
Of course this is an estimate,
because we did not take a

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:02.210
differential.

00:34:02.210 --> 00:34:05.855
If we actually calculate the
deformation gradient the way

00:34:05.855 --> 00:34:12.010
it's being defined, we get 1.80,
which is quite close to

00:34:12.010 --> 00:34:13.570
the estimate here.

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:15.690
The reason for that difference,
of course, is that

00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:20.850
0 x 1, for this particle, is not
close enough, close enough

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:23.620
to the earlier particle,
the other particle that

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:24.510
we also looked at.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:30.719
In other words, 0.850 is not
close enough to 0.8, in order

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:35.120
to get a very close relationship
here between

00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.900
these two numbers.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.750
Let's look at another
example, a two

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.989
dimensional deformation example.

00:34:41.989 --> 00:34:46.190
Here now, we have as the
original configuration, this

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:50.480
black body here, black outline
shown, in the coordinate

00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.730
system x 1 X 2.

00:34:51.730 --> 00:34:53.790
Once again, remember the
coordinate system is

00:34:53.790 --> 00:34:55.380
stationary.

00:34:55.380 --> 00:34:58.410
And let us look at two
material fibers, this

00:34:58.410 --> 00:34:59.460
one and that one.

00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.170
This one does not carry a hat.

00:35:01.170 --> 00:35:03.140
That one carries a hat.

00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.070
So these are two different
material fibers.

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:12.740
These fibers move to here
from time 0 to time t.

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:16.340
This fiber, d 0 x
becomes d t x.

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:20.415
That fiber, d 0 x hat,
becomes d t x hat.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:27.910
In other words, of course, this
here in red shown, is the

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:30.580
configuration at time t.

00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:34.650
Now, notice that these fibers
here have particular

00:35:34.650 --> 00:35:38.250
coordinates, 0 x 1, 0 x 2.

00:35:38.250 --> 00:35:40.610
You can think of these
coordinates to be at the

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:42.920
beginning of that fiber.

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.390
Of course, these are
differential fibers.

00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:47.790
They are very, very small.

00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:51.080
These coordinates move
over to t x 1, t x 2.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.580
In other words, the particle
from here moves to here and

00:35:54.580 --> 00:35:56.890
takes on these coordinates.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:36:00.310
We also, say, know,
that the whole--

00:36:00.310 --> 00:36:04.700
I mean we also know, the whole
deformation field.

00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:07.910
And therefore we can directly
calculate the deformation

00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:11.460
gradient, the way I explained
it, by taking the

00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:15.420
differentiation of the current
coordinates with respect to

00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:16.830
the original coordinates.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:21.970
And those differentiations
give us these elements.

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:28.700
If we do so, we have the
relationships between the d 0

00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:32.560
x and d t x given
right down here.

00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:41.610
Notice, d 0 x has these
components in the x 1 x 2

00:36:41.610 --> 00:36:43.320
coordinate frame.

00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:49.710
And you can see, for example,
this 0.866, the component in

00:36:49.710 --> 00:36:53.240
the x 1 direction, this
0.5 is the component

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.580
into the x 2 direction.

00:36:56.580 --> 00:37:00.710
If we multiply this
out, we get d t x.

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:05.500
And d t x, shown here, has
no component into the x 2

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.450
direction, but has a component
of 0.75 long

00:37:09.450 --> 00:37:11.360
into the x 1 direction.

00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:16.950
What this tells us, is that if
we know the motion of the body

00:37:16.950 --> 00:37:22.810
from time 0 to time t, and
particularly at time t, and if

00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:25.570
we have calculated the
deformation gradient the way

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:31.880
we have defined it, then we can
relate how the original

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:36.040
fibers, or the fibers in the
original configuration will

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:39.350
rotate and stretch.

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:43.550
And that relationship is given
via the deformation gradient,

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:46.420
as surely shown here
quite physically.

00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:53.560
Because this fiber, originally
here, has rotated into a new

00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:56.500
position, and has, in this
particular case, been

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.750
compressed.

00:37:59.490 --> 00:38:05.160
So, this relationship tells us
how the fiber has moved,

00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.610
rotated, and compressed.

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:11.370
It does not tell us how
much the movement was.

00:38:11.370 --> 00:38:13.780
That is not given by
this relationship.

00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:17.410
That we have already, because
we have to have that

00:38:17.410 --> 00:38:20.610
information to calculate
t 0 x.

00:38:20.610 --> 00:38:24.040
But what this information, this
equation gives us, is how

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:29.800
much the fiber has rotated and
compressed, or stretched.

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:34.420
Well, let's look at another
fiber, the one that we had on

00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:36.330
the earlier viewgraph.

00:38:36.330 --> 00:38:38.700
Here, another fiber.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.910
And if we recognize, of course,
that for that material

00:38:42.910 --> 00:38:46.690
particle here, the same material
particle still, we

00:38:46.690 --> 00:38:49.470
still have the same deformation
gradient.

00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:54.840
We can take this fiber, or
rather the vectorial

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.780
representation of that fiber,
as given here, multiply this

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:03.090
out, and we directly find out
what has happened to that

00:39:03.090 --> 00:39:07.180
infinitesimal fiber in the
motion that we're considering.

00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.900
Notice, in this particular case,
the components of this

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.570
fiber are 0 in this direction,
1.5 into that direction.

00:39:15.570 --> 00:39:22.310
And it has moved to here, and
has taken on components 1 and

00:39:22.310 --> 00:39:24.935
1 into each of the coordinate
directions.

00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:34.360
The deformation gradient is
very useful for various

00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.920
measures, computations
that we perform in

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:39.570
finite element analysis.

00:39:39.570 --> 00:39:44.480
And one such computation
is to calculate the

00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:46.380
mass density ratios.

00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:51.120
In other words, we have to
assess how the mass density of

00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:56.850
the body, as it moves through
the space, changes.

00:39:56.850 --> 00:39:59.900
Let us look at how we do that.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.820
Here we have our stationary
coordinate

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:04.760
system, x 1, x 2, x 3.

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.380
And in that stationary
coordinate system, I'd like to

00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:11.050
focus our attention onto a
differential volume, a very

00:40:11.050 --> 00:40:12.490
small volume.

00:40:12.490 --> 00:40:16.340
I call that 0 d V curl.

00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:19.400
A curl is there because it is a
specific volume that we now

00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:20.740
want to look at.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:25.620
Notice that the volume that
I'm talking about here is

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:30.200
spanned out by the
differential.

00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:36.390
Differential is d 0 x curl
1, 2 and 3 not shown.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:39.800
But this is the infinitesimal
volume at time 0.

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:44.230
Now, in the motion from time
0 to time t, of course this

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.280
volume will change.

00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:51.870
And at time t, it
looks like this.

00:40:51.870 --> 00:40:53.310
Notice that these

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.530
differentials here have changed.

00:40:55.530 --> 00:41:01.540
We show just one, d 0 x curl
one, has gone over into d t x

00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:06.870
curl 1, the t now
denoting time t.

00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:11.870
And this is the volume obtained
from, that can be

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:15.300
calculated from these
vectors shown here.

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.580
In fact, this is how we
calculate this volume, and can

00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:21.970
therefore relate, also,
the mass densities.

00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:27.090
Let us look at some of
the basic equations.

00:41:27.090 --> 00:41:30.810
First of all, we can say that
the mass in this volume, this

00:41:30.810 --> 00:41:34.130
differential volume that we have
focused our attention on,

00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:37.430
and that I have given a curl
for that reason, that that

00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:40.460
mass must be preserved.

00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:43.710
And this means that this
relationship must hold.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:48.120
Volume times mass density at
time t must be equal to volume

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.300
times mass density at time 0.

00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.880
We can show, then, that this
relationship holds.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.570
And I will talk about that just
now it a little bit more.

00:41:57.570 --> 00:42:01.660
And these two relationships,
then, clearly give us that

00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:04.790
this is how the mass
density changes.

00:42:04.790 --> 00:42:09.100
In other words, the mass density
at time t can directly

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:12.440
be calculated from the mass
density at time 0 and the

00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:16.590
determinant of the deformation
gradient tensor.

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:19.620
Notice, in three dimensional
analysis, this is a three by

00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:20.620
three matrix.

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.930
And you would have to calculate
this matrix, at the

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:27.330
particular point that you're
focusing your attention on,

00:42:27.330 --> 00:42:30.750
and take the determinant
of that matrix.

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:33.340
Let us look at this relationship
here, because

00:42:33.340 --> 00:42:35.470
that is a very basic
relationship.

00:42:35.470 --> 00:42:40.290
It tells how the volume, the
differential volumes change as

00:42:40.290 --> 00:42:43.250
a function of time.

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:48.440
And to show you how we arrive
at this relationship, I've

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:50.950
just compiled here a
few viewgraphs to

00:42:50.950 --> 00:42:53.290
give you the proof.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:57.660
Initially, we can say that d 0
x curl 1 is given via this

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:58.520
relationship.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:02.630
Notice, this is the length
of this vector, simply.

00:43:02.630 --> 00:43:06.710
And, notice that I had aligned
this vector with the x 1

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:10.170
coordinate axis, therefore
these 0s.

00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.920
Similar, d 0 x curl 2 was
aligned with the x 2

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:17.280
coordinate axis, and therefore
these two 0s.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:21.450
And the length of the
vector is d s 2.

00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:26.510
d x curl 3 is given similarly,
but aligned, this vector is

00:43:26.510 --> 00:43:30.590
aligned in the 3 direction, and
the length was given as,

00:43:30.590 --> 00:43:32.900
is given as d s 3.

00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:37.330
Hence, by simple calculation,
of course, we find directly

00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:40.750
that the volume, the
differential volume that in

00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:46.200
the original configuration, is
given via this equation.

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:53.240
But, if we now recognize that
we can express d t x curl i

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:57.510
via this relationship here, and
that is nothing else than

00:43:57.510 --> 00:44:01.380
applying the deformation
gradient tensor the way we

00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:04.340
already talked about.

00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:09.070
We looked already at examples
where we put in a particular

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:15.220
fiber, original configuration,
and calculated how this fiber

00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:19.160
stretched, deformed from
time 0 to time t.

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:21.180
I just gave you some examples.

00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:26.840
And we use that information now,
here, to express the d t

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:31.580
x curl i in terms
of d 0 x curl i.

00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:34.530
Of course, for i
equals 1, 2, 3.

00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:39.420
And now we use here a formula
that you must have encountered

00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:43.680
some time ago, in your studies
of mathematics.

00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:47.380
If you look at your old math
books, I'm sure you can

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:51.560
extract that formula, which
simply says that the volume

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:56.720
given, spanned by these vectors,
is given via this

00:44:56.720 --> 00:44:59.300
product here, as a cross product
of these two vectors,

00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:02.610
and the dot product of the
resulting two vectors.

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:05.750
This, of course, gives you a
vector here, and you dot this

00:45:05.750 --> 00:45:09.760
vector with this vector, and you
get, directly, a number,

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.450
which is the volume
of interest.

00:45:13.450 --> 00:45:18.450
However, if we now multiply
this out here, you find,

00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:21.710
directly, that this
is the answer.

00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:24.050
In other words, the deformation
gradient comes in

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:24.890
right there.

00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:26.140
The determinant of
the deformation

00:45:26.140 --> 00:45:27.500
gradient comes in here.

00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:29.850
Of course, it comes in here
because you would substitute

00:45:29.850 --> 00:45:32.080
from here into there.

00:45:32.080 --> 00:45:35.800
And once again, since this
product here is nothing else

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:39.090
than the original volume,
we're home.

00:45:39.090 --> 00:45:44.730
We have proven that d t V curl
is equal to the determinant of

00:45:44.730 --> 00:45:50.640
t 0 x times 0 d V curl, the
determinate of the deformation

00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.660
gradient in this relationship
between the

00:45:53.660 --> 00:45:55.350
differential volumes.

00:45:55.350 --> 00:45:59.860
It's really an interesting
proof, and maybe you want to

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.570
think a little bit more about
it, and even go through this

00:46:03.570 --> 00:46:07.860
arithmetic here, to really
reinforce the understanding of

00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.240
what we are doing here.

00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:17.910
Let's look at a simple example
to just exemplify once again

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.640
what we just talked about.

00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.020
Here we have a little example.

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:28.150
A piece of material 1 long,
that in its original

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:30.200
configuration is 1 long,
I should say.

00:46:30.200 --> 00:46:33.230
We are stretching that
piece of material up

00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:36.290
to time t, as shown.

00:46:36.290 --> 00:46:38.330
We assume uniform stretching.

00:46:38.330 --> 00:46:40.300
We assume plain strain
conditions.

00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:44.810
In other words, the strain
through the thickness is equal

00:46:44.810 --> 00:46:48.520
to 0 here, in this
particular case.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:53.290
And the deformation field is
assumed to be as shown here.

00:46:53.290 --> 00:46:57.500
Then, with the deformation field
given, clearly we can

00:46:57.500 --> 00:46:59.640
calculate this deformation
gradient.

00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:04.150
Here, this component is simply
obtained by differentiating t

00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:06.890
x 1 with respect to 0 x 1.

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:14.590
If you do so, you get a 1 here
plus 0.25, giving you a 1.25.

00:47:14.590 --> 00:47:17.630
Because there is no shearing
in the material, and no

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:21.370
rotation, these off diagonal
terms are 0.

00:47:21.370 --> 00:47:24.900
And, because there is no
stretching through this

00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:28.310
direction, and through the
thickness direction, we have

00:47:28.310 --> 00:47:29.960
1s right there.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.700
To take the determinant of this
matrix is rather simple.

00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:36.430
You just take the product of
the diagonal terms, and you

00:47:36.430 --> 00:47:40.590
directly obtain 1.25 for
its determinant.

00:47:40.590 --> 00:47:43.730
Now, let us plug this
into our formula.

00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:45.930
And here we have the result
of that formula.

00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:53.200
It tells us 0 rho is equal to
1.25 t rho for any particle,

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.580
right here, because this
relationship is independent of

00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.410
the 0 x 1 component.

00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:02.410
Well, of course, this is also
a result of the uniform

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:04.050
stretching.

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:07.370
Notice that this makes
physical sense.

00:48:07.370 --> 00:48:11.930
If we have taken a piece
of material up here--

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:13.580
once more let us look at it--

00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:16.810
that does not shrink here,
that does not stretch or

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:20.840
shrink in this normal direction
as well, then surely

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:24.920
the mass density has to decrease
as we stretch it.

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:29.550
And in fact, this is being shown
right down here, t rho

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:33.330
is equal to 0 rho
divided by 1.25.

00:48:33.330 --> 00:48:35.340
So, the result makes sense.

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:41.930
We use also the inverse
deformation gradient.

00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:47.660
And here, on this viewgraph,
I've just summarized a few

00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:51.150
equations regarding this inverse
deformation gradient.

00:48:51.150 --> 00:48:53.400
Here, we now look at the
equation, where on the

00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:58.810
left-hand side we have the
material fiber at time 0, and

00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:01.980
on the right-hand side is the
material fiber at time t.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:06.270
In other words, d 0 x on the
left-hand side, and d t x on

00:49:06.270 --> 00:49:07.530
the right-hand side.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:11.340
The inverse deformation gradient
stands right here.

00:49:11.340 --> 00:49:15.050
Mathematically, we can show that
the inverse deformation

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:19.040
gradient is nothing else
than t 0 x inverse.

00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:24.340
Of course, notice that 0 t
x would be calculated by

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:28.950
differentiating the original
coordinates with respect to

00:49:28.950 --> 00:49:31.820
the coordinates at time t.

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:36.350
However, we can also calculate
this matrix directly by taking

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:41.690
this matrix here, where we
differentiate the coordinates

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:45.080
at time t with respect to the
original coordinates.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.490
And then, having obtained this
matrix, calculated this

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:49.980
matrix, we simply invert it.

00:49:49.980 --> 00:49:52.710
Well the proof that indeed
holds is given

00:49:52.710 --> 00:49:54.080
down here in green.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:59.755
We simply take the top equation
and substitute for d

00:49:59.755 --> 00:50:04.690
t x, as shown here, our
relationship that we had

00:50:04.690 --> 00:50:05.900
already earlier.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:10.590
And, if we then, well, look at
this equation, we can put

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.130
brackets around here.

00:50:12.130 --> 00:50:18.580
And since d 0 x is equal to d
0 x for any material fiber,

00:50:18.580 --> 00:50:20.770
this must be the identity
matrix, which already

00:50:20.770 --> 00:50:22.790
completes the proof.

00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:25.610
An important theorem in
continuum mechanics is the

00:50:25.610 --> 00:50:30.080
polar decomposition theorem,
which tells that the

00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:35.040
deformation gradient, t 0 x, can
always be decomposed into

00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:39.150
a rotation matrix and
a stretch matrix.

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:43.210
The rotation matrix is an
orthogonal matrix, of course,

00:50:43.210 --> 00:50:47.290
meaning that R, transposed R,
is the identity matrix.

00:50:47.290 --> 00:50:51.130
And the stretch matrix is
a symmetric matrix.

00:50:51.130 --> 00:50:54.890
This can always be
done for any x.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:50:58.580
And the proof, actually, is
given in the textbook.

00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:02.140
Please look at your study guide,
where I indicate where

00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.120
you can find the proof
in the textbook.

00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:07.180
And it might be quite good to
actually go through that proof

00:51:07.180 --> 00:51:09.890
in some detail, so as to
reinforce your understanding

00:51:09.890 --> 00:51:13.570
of what this theorem
really tells.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:16.370
The important point, once again,
is that we can always

00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:21.930
write the x matrix into this
form as R times u.

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:27.810
And to give you an example of
what this means, let's look at

00:51:27.810 --> 00:51:29.280
this one here.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:34.560
Here we have, in the coordinate
frame x 1 x 2, a

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:39.670
piece of material
3 long 2 wide.

00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:42.840
This is the original
configuration of the material.

00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:46.660
And that material moves
from time 0 to

00:51:46.660 --> 00:51:48.750
time t, as shown here.

00:51:48.750 --> 00:51:53.140
First it moves, it is being
stretched into the x 1

00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:56.230
direction and into the x 2
direction to take on the

00:51:56.230 --> 00:51:58.290
configuration shown in red.

00:51:58.290 --> 00:52:02.270
And then it rotates to take on
the configuration in green.

00:52:02.270 --> 00:52:06.160
And that, indeed, is the
configuration at time t.

00:52:06.160 --> 00:52:10.130
Let us calculate the x matrix
corresponding to that

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:13.570
configuration, and see how
it would be decomposed

00:52:13.570 --> 00:52:15.530
into R times u.

00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:17.750
Well, we have done
that down here.

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:21.200
Notice, this is the
x matrix, t 0 x.

00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:24.040
These are the components
of that matrix.

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:28.970
And here we have the R matrix,
t 0 R. And here we

00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:31.240
have the t 0 u.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:34.440
In other words, this is the
rotation matrix, and this is

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:35.890
the stretch matrix.

00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:39.330
Notice this stretch matrix
is indeed symmetric.

00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:41.910
Let's look at the components in
the stretch matrix a little

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:43.330
bit closer.

00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:50.215
1.33 is nothing else than 4
divided by 3, in other words,

00:52:50.215 --> 00:52:53.610
the stretching into
the x 1 direction.

00:52:53.610 --> 00:52:58.880
1.5, down here, is nothing else
than the stretching into

00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:03.810
x 2 direction, namely
2 goes over into 3.

00:53:03.810 --> 00:53:06.850
3 divided by 2, 1.5.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:10.370
Notice that these off diagonal
elements are 0, the reason

00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:15.150
being that there has been no
shearing from the original

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:19.760
configuration to the
red configuration.

00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.170
The rotation matrix really
expresses mathematically the

00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:27.500
movement of this red piece of
material into the green

00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:29.030
configuration.

00:53:29.030 --> 00:53:32.170
Notice that the entries in
this rotation matrix are

00:53:32.170 --> 00:53:34.790
nothing else than cosines
and sines of

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:37.290
this 30-degree rotation.

00:53:37.290 --> 00:53:41.670
For example, here you have
the cosine of 30 degrees.

00:53:41.670 --> 00:53:43.230
This is the sine
of 30 degrees.

00:53:43.230 --> 00:53:46.010
In fact, it's the rotation of
this material fiber right

00:53:46.010 --> 00:53:48.590
there, from here into there.

00:53:48.590 --> 00:53:51.830
Well, this is the rotation
matrix and stretch matrix for

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:53.090
this example.

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:56.510
And we could easily construct
other examples.

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:59.420
In fact, you find in the
textbook some more examples

00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:04.090
that you might want to study
regarding this particular

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:06.400
phenomenon.

00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:09.950
Using the deformation gradient,
we can describe, we

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:13.700
can define a Cauchy-Green
deformation tensor.

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:15.730
There is a right Cauchy-Green
deformation tensor.

00:54:15.730 --> 00:54:18.060
There is also a left
Cauchy-Green deformation

00:54:18.060 --> 00:54:20.480
tensor which, however,
we will not be using.

00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.910
So, when I talk about the
Cauchy-Green deformation

00:54:22.910 --> 00:54:24.950
tensor, I really mean the right

00:54:24.950 --> 00:54:26.760
Cauchy-Green deformation tensor.

00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:28.670
And it's defined
as shown here.

00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:31.300
We take the deformation
gradient, transposed, times

00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.940
the deformation gradient.

00:54:32.940 --> 00:54:39.040
Now, notice the deformation
gradient is always a three by

00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:43.120
three matrix, in a three
dimensional coordinate space.

00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.230
However, it can be
a non-symmetric

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:46.600
or symmetric matrix.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.660
Generally, it is a non-symmetric
matrix.

00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:51.470
It would be a symmetric matrix
if there has been no rotation

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:52.740
points on it.

00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:54.960
But, in general, it's
non-symmetric.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:59.290
Notice that this non-symmetric
matrix, multiplied here, as

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:03.320
shown by the non-symmetric
matrix transposed, makes c

00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:06.570
symmetric, a very important
information.

00:55:06.570 --> 00:55:12.980
Well, indeed, if we substitute
for x here, we find that c is

00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:17.600
nothing else than
t 0 u squared.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:21.540
In other words, the stretch
matrix squared, since R is

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:21.940
orthogonal.

00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.980
R goes in here.

00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:26.410
But R transposed R, of course,
is the identity matrix.

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:30.780
And therefore c is
simply u squared.

00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:35.660
Notice that t 0 c is independent
of the rotation,

00:55:35.660 --> 00:55:38.590
via this equation here, and
therefore we say that c is

00:55:38.590 --> 00:55:41.570
invariant under a rigid
body rotation.

00:55:41.570 --> 00:55:44.790
In other words, a rigid body
rotation of a material fiber

00:55:44.790 --> 00:55:49.590
does not enter into
the elements of c.

00:55:49.590 --> 00:55:52.280
Let's look at an example.

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.500
Two dimensional motion, the
original configuration for the

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:58.170
piece of material that I like
to consider is shown here.

00:55:58.170 --> 00:56:03.000
It moves from time 0 to time t,
to the red configuration.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:06.330
And then, in the increment of
time delta t to that green

00:56:06.330 --> 00:56:07.510
configuration.

00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:12.040
But this movement over time
delta t is simply a rigid body

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:14.620
motion of 90 degrees.

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:18.430
Well, we can calculate t 0
x corresponding to this

00:56:18.430 --> 00:56:19.500
configuration.

00:56:19.500 --> 00:56:20.800
Here it's done.

00:56:20.800 --> 00:56:23.930
And, by the formula that I gave
you, you get directly t 0

00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:27.480
c by taking x transposed
times x.

00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.480
You get this matrix here.

00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:33.550
Well, now we can also
calculate t 0 x.

00:56:33.550 --> 00:56:35.800
How do we obtain, by the
way, this matrix?

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.140
There is a subtle point.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:41.570
You obtain this matrix simply by
pre-multiplying this matrix

00:56:41.570 --> 00:56:44.920
by a rotation matrix
corresponding to this

00:56:44.920 --> 00:56:47.150
90-degree rotation.

00:56:47.150 --> 00:56:49.040
This is the answer.

00:56:49.040 --> 00:56:54.180
And if we now take this matrix,
transposed by the

00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:58.030
matrix itself, in other words
this product x transpose x, we

00:56:58.030 --> 00:56:59.430
get the c matrix.

00:56:59.430 --> 00:57:04.670
And we notice that the c
matrices are the same for both

00:57:04.670 --> 00:57:06.500
of these configurations.

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:11.750
In other words, this simply
exemplifies that the rigid

00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:17.370
body rotation from red to green
here did not enter into

00:57:17.370 --> 00:57:19.840
the elements of the c.

00:57:19.840 --> 00:57:23.405
They did not change from time
t to time t plus delta t.

00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:32.380
We use this c matrix to define
a strain measure, the

00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:34.750
Green-Lagrange strain measure.

00:57:34.750 --> 00:57:36.720
It's, of course, a strain
measure that is very well

00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:40.470
known, described in many,
many textbooks.

00:57:40.470 --> 00:57:43.600
And it is, however, very useful
for finite element

00:57:43.600 --> 00:57:47.170
analysis, as I briefly pointed
out already earlier.

00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:50.930
This is the definition of the
Green-Lagrange strain tensor.

00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:54.260
Notice, this here is a three
by three matrix.

00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:57.160
And we are taking this three
by three matrix.

00:57:57.160 --> 00:58:00.870
We subtract the identity
matrix.

00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:03.000
The identity matrix, of course,
being just 1s on the

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.740
diagonal, and 0s on all the
off diagonal elements.

00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:10.150
And there is a 1/2 here that
gives us the definition of the

00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:12.670
Green-Lagrange strain tensor.

00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:16.140
There are a number of very
interesting properties that

00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:18.640
this strain tensor displays.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.580
And I've listed them here.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.170
We can see that this strain
tensor is symmetric.

00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:27.960
We can see that this strain
tensor does not change from

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:33.340
time t to time t plus delta t if
the only motion from time t

00:58:33.340 --> 00:58:37.850
to time t plus delta t was
a rigid body motion.

00:58:37.850 --> 00:58:41.550
And we can see directly that
the Green-Lagrange strain

00:58:41.550 --> 00:58:49.570
tensor is 0 if, from time 0 to
time t, the only motion was a

00:58:49.570 --> 00:58:52.950
rigid body motion.

00:58:52.950 --> 00:58:57.690
One can prove these particular
items, these statements, and I

00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:00.040
would like to encourage
you to do so.

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:02.770
While you are doing it, I
will do the same here.

00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:05.900
And then we share our
experiences regarding these

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.150
proofs just afterwards.

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:15.830
Well, here I am giving now to
you some information regarding

00:59:15.830 --> 00:59:17.350
these proofs.

00:59:17.350 --> 00:59:22.240
t 0 epsilon is symmetric because
t 0 c is symmetric.

00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:25.480
And remember, we take here a
symmetric matrix from which we

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:28.910
subtract a symmetric matrix, and
clearly, the result must

00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:30.460
be a symmetric matrix.

00:59:30.460 --> 00:59:33.620
A very simple proof really.

00:59:33.620 --> 00:59:36.780
Regarding the second item that I
mentioned earlier, for rigid

00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:41.280
body motion, we know that from
time t to time t plus delta t,

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:47.270
we have that x at time t plus
delta t can be written as R

00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:49.420
times t 0 x.

00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:51.860
In other words, here I'm talking
about the deformation

00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:55.420
gradient at time t plus delta
t, and here about the

00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:57.020
deformation gradient
at time t.

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:01.040
And they are related merely
by a rotation matrix.

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:07.120
Now, if you substitute from here
into this equation, but

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.620
apply the time t plus delta t,
you obtain, of course, as we

01:00:10.620 --> 01:00:14.520
saw actually on the earlier
example, that this c matrix

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:16.250
does not change.

01:00:16.250 --> 01:00:19.700
And therefore, also the
Green-Lagrange stain tensor

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.160
does not change.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:23.870
In fact, all of this information
was really

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:27.740
addressed in the earlier
examples that we discussed.

01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:31.420
Also, for rigid body motion, we
have that the c matrix is

01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.540
simply the identity matrix,
because remember, the c

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:38.190
matrix, Cauchy-Green deformation
tensor, does not

01:00:38.190 --> 01:00:41.090
change with rigid
body rotation.

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.260
It is equal to the
identity matrix.

01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:49.350
And if you then takes this c
matrix and substitute right up

01:00:49.350 --> 01:00:53.640
there, on the top, you get that
the Green-Lagrange strain

01:00:53.640 --> 01:00:55.640
tensor is 0.

01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:01.080
So, 3 properties, really, that
we want to keep in mind

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.120
regarding the Green-Lagrange
strain tensor when we

01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:07.040
later on use it.

01:01:07.040 --> 01:01:09.710
Another definition of the
Green-Lagrange strain tensor

01:01:09.710 --> 01:01:12.170
is given on this viewgraph.

01:01:12.170 --> 01:01:15.180
In fact, this right-hand side
that I'm showing here is

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:20.130
simply obtained by substituting,
for the

01:01:20.130 --> 01:01:26.080
deformation gradient, the
identity matrix plus the

01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:29.380
deformation while the
displacement derivatives, with

01:01:29.380 --> 01:01:31.190
respect to the coordinates.

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:34.520
In other words, what you want
to do, basically, is to

01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:40.600
substitute for t 0 x, in
terms of displacements.

01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:45.070
And if you go through and write
all the information out,

01:01:45.070 --> 01:01:49.510
you end up that the t 0 epsilon
i j component of the

01:01:49.510 --> 01:01:52.290
Green-Lagrange strain
tensor is given by

01:01:52.290 --> 01:01:54.610
this equation here.

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:58.370
Notice that we have here i, j,
the same subscript that you

01:01:58.370 --> 01:01:59.370
see here, too.

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:01.250
Of course, we're differentiating
with respect

01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:02.960
to the j component here.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.240
Here we have j, i, and
here k, i k,j.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:09.860
We're summing over k here.

01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:13.280
Notice also, that this part
here is non-linear in the

01:02:13.280 --> 01:02:14.540
displacements.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.510
This part is non-linear in the
displacements because these

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:20.120
are, so to say, quadratic
terms.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:24.990
This here, this part, is linear
in displacements.

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:28.540
From time to time, students
approach me and say to me,

01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:32.530
well, you must have neglected
something in the definition,

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:35.460
or in this Green-Lagrange
strain tensor.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.150
Because you're only going
up to quadratic terms.

01:02:38.150 --> 01:02:42.170
you must have neglected cubic
terms, and high order terms.

01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:45.300
Well, the answer there is, we
have really neglected nothing.

01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:50.520
The point is, that we have
defined this tensor to be

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:52.710
given by this equation.

01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:56.300
Of course, my earlier definition
was in terms of

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:59.200
deformation gradients,
in terms of

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.990
the deformation gradient.

01:03:00.990 --> 01:03:04.160
Now we actually have here
substituted displacements.

01:03:04.160 --> 01:03:06.100
But it's still a definition.

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.660
This is, in fact,
the same tensor.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:12.745
The same components here would
be calculated using the

01:03:12.745 --> 01:03:15.830
earlier definition than
this one here.

01:03:15.830 --> 01:03:17.560
Same thing.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:21.140
And, as I say, it holds for any
deformation, any amount of

01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.010
straining and stretching.

01:03:24.010 --> 01:03:27.470
Let's look at one example, a
very simple example, where we

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.940
have a simple four-node
element that

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:31.150
we are pulling out.

01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:33.420
Originally, it it is in the
black configuration.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.300
It goes over into the
red configuration.

01:03:36.300 --> 01:03:41.190
If we calculate t 0 epsilon 1 1
from the formula that I just

01:03:41.190 --> 01:03:45.090
showed you, you get
these two terms.

01:03:45.090 --> 01:03:48.110
This here is the engineering
strain term that we are very

01:03:48.110 --> 01:03:49.500
well familiar with.

01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:52.240
And this is here the non-linear
term, because it's

01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:53.210
a quadratic term.

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:56.040
Non-linear in the displacement,
of course.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.950
If we plot this information,
as shown here on the graph,

01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:05.900
notice we're showing here t
delta over L, the original

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:10.190
length, where t delta
is the displacement.

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:14.670
And we have plotting here the
epsilon 1 1 component.

01:04:14.670 --> 01:04:17.000
Actually, we should
have said here--

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:19.430
let me make this correction
right now here--

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:21.450
we should have had, really
have had here a

01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:25.240
t 0 epsilon 1 1.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.720
The t 0 was missing there.

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:30.380
Well, if we plot, in other
words, this component here as

01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:35.310
a function of these elements
here, of the t delta over 0 L,

01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:39.300
we get this red line,
the red line.

01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.560
Notice the non-linearality
in that strain.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.340
The engineering strain, which
is only the first term here,

01:04:45.340 --> 01:04:48.300
gives us a straight line.

01:04:48.300 --> 01:04:53.690
Notice that this strain here
increases quite rapidly as you

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:58.080
pull out, and it decreases in
magnitude here, with this

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:00.600
curvature, as you push in.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:05.190
So there's no symmetry in the
strain when you extend or

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:07.600
compress a piece of material.

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.810
In the engineering strain
component, of course, we see a

01:05:09.810 --> 01:05:11.790
symmetry, because we have
a straight line.

01:05:15.430 --> 01:05:21.720
Let us look at another example
to calculate once the

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.200
Green-Lagrange strain.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:27.180
Here, we have the original
configuration

01:05:27.180 --> 01:05:28.710
of a four-node element.

01:05:28.710 --> 01:05:31.810
And that four-node element,
shown black here, goes over

01:05:31.810 --> 01:05:36.350
into this configuration at time
t, stretched into two

01:05:36.350 --> 01:05:40.440
directions, and then, at time t
plus delta t, it has rotated

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.720
by 45 degrees.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:46.340
The deformation gradient
corresponding to time t is

01:05:46.340 --> 01:05:48.870
shown here.

01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:51.620
The Cauchy-Green deformation
tensor shown here.

01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:54.120
Notice no off diagonal
elements.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:59.460
Because the piece of material,
the four-node element-- you

01:05:59.460 --> 01:06:02.550
may think of this as a four-node
element, of course--

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:04.740
has simply been stretched
and compressed.

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:05.810
There's no shearing.

01:06:05.810 --> 01:06:08.630
Therefore, we have
0 terms here.

01:06:08.630 --> 01:06:12.030
And, if we calculate the
Green-Lagrange strain tensor,

01:06:12.030 --> 01:06:13.780
we get this answer.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:17.930
Once again, no shearing
components in

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:19.730
this tensor as well.

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:22.880
If we now do the same for the
configuration at time t plus

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:27.060
delta t, the green
configuration, we obtain this

01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:29.690
deformation gradient, this
Cauchy-Green deformation

01:06:29.690 --> 01:06:32.800
tensor, and this is a
Green-Lagrange strain tensor.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.710
Where we notice that the
Cauchy-Green deformation

01:06:35.710 --> 01:06:41.020
tensor has not changed, and
the Green-Lagrange strain

01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:43.310
tensor has also not changed.

01:06:43.310 --> 01:06:45.870
And this is what, of course,
we have proven already

01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:50.580
earlier, that from time t to
time t plus delta t, the

01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:53.260
Green-Lagrange strain tensor
and the Cauchy-Green

01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:56.560
deformation tensor, both
of those do not change.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.760
However for rigid body motion,
the x tensor, the deformation

01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:06.360
gradient, does change, look at
here, because this deformation

01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:10.160
gradient is affected
by the rotation.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:14.160
Let's look at another example,
because all these examples

01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:18.110
really enrich our understanding
of what these

01:07:18.110 --> 01:07:21.240
kinematic quantities stand for,
and what they give us.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:26.260
Here, we look at the example of
a simple shear deformation.

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:30.130
Originally, the element that we
are looking at was in this

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:32.420
configuration.

01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.040
And, it is sheared over.

01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.620
You can think of this top line
being simply moved over

01:07:38.620 --> 01:07:42.360
horizontally into the
red configuration.

01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:45.970
Notice that the original
length here is 1.

01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:47.890
This length is also 1.

01:07:47.890 --> 01:07:52.470
Notice that the movement
over is t delta.

01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:54.990
And we calculate
the deformation

01:07:54.990 --> 01:07:55.960
gradient once again.

01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:58.670
The deformation gradient now
being given by via these

01:07:58.670 --> 01:07:59.570
components.

01:07:59.570 --> 01:08:02.280
Let's try to explain these
components a bit.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:07.050
Well, this here is really the
differentiation of t x 1 with

01:08:07.050 --> 01:08:09.140
respect to 0 x 1.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:12.670
Now, t x 1 has not changed,
and therefore, this is 1.

01:08:12.670 --> 01:08:15.410
t x 1 is equal to 0 x 1
in other words, and

01:08:15.410 --> 01:08:17.270
therefore, this is 1.

01:08:17.270 --> 01:08:21.760
Notice that the same holds also
for partial t x 2 with

01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:24.120
respect to 0 x 2.

01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.934
Notice that this element here
stands for partial t x 1 with

01:08:27.934 --> 01:08:29.850
respect to 0 x 2.

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:34.149
And there, we look at partial
t x 1, a change into this

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:38.270
direction as we walk that
direction, and that gives us

01:08:38.270 --> 01:08:43.800
this t delta, t delta over
this length here.

01:08:43.800 --> 01:08:46.899
In other words, this element
is nothing else than this

01:08:46.899 --> 01:08:49.609
length divided by that length.

01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:53.630
And it's, of course, the same
for any material particle over

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:54.800
this domain.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:57.810
Because all of these material
particles have

01:08:57.810 --> 01:08:59.420
been sheared over.

01:08:59.420 --> 01:09:02.990
Well, if you now take x
transposed times x, you get

01:09:02.990 --> 01:09:04.779
this matrix here.

01:09:04.779 --> 01:09:08.529
And you identify directly
these terms, if we then

01:09:08.529 --> 01:09:11.040
calculate by the formula given,
the Green-Lagrange

01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:13.450
strain, this is the result.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:17.609
Notice that here we have now
shearing components.

01:09:17.609 --> 01:09:20.880
And notice also one very
interesting phenomena, a

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:24.319
component appearing here.

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:26.939
This is an interesting
component, because it is

01:09:26.939 --> 01:09:30.590
really an enormous strain
component in this direction.

01:09:30.590 --> 01:09:33.500
And now there's an epsilon 1, 1,
epsilon 2, 2, I should have

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:38.130
said, component, an epsilon 2,
2 component that is non-zero

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:39.950
in this particular case,

01:09:39.950 --> 01:09:43.840
In a material non-linear-only
formulation, where we only

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.740
include infinitesimal
displacements, in other words,

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:49.700
this part, of course,
would be 0.

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.220
And that is also signified
by the square term.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.870
In other words, if indeed the
motion is small in this

01:09:55.870 --> 01:10:01.610
direction, then this would
become 0, at least

01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:05.370
approximately 0 when compared
to these terms, and it means

01:10:05.370 --> 01:10:09.440
that the Green-Lagrange strain
tensor reduces to the

01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.210
infinitesimal strain tensor that
we are so familiar with.

01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:18.750
The 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress
tensor and the Green-Lagrange

01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:22.120
strain tensors are energetically
conjugate.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.060
This is a very important
statement.

01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:29.670
And this is the reason why we
are working with these two

01:10:29.670 --> 01:10:32.150
tensors, the 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff
stress tensor

01:10:32.150 --> 01:10:33.980
and the Green-Lagrange
strain tensor.

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:40.590
In fact, what is happening here,
is that this product

01:10:40.590 --> 01:10:45.340
here, which is the virtual work
at time t per current

01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:51.990
volume, per unit current volume,
that this here is

01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:57.210
given, of course, by the Cauchy
stress times the small,

01:10:57.210 --> 01:11:03.410
or the virtual, infinitesimal
strain, is defined this way.

01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:07.310
And here, we have the virtual
work at time t per unit

01:11:07.310 --> 01:11:08.970
original volume.

01:11:08.970 --> 01:11:13.650
And that is given by the 2nd
Piola-Kirchhoff stress times

01:11:13.650 --> 01:11:17.520
the variation in the
Green-Lagrange strain.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:22.170
We already had, earlier, that
the integration of this over

01:11:22.170 --> 01:11:25.900
the current volume is equal
to the integration of this

01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:29.070
quantity over the
original volume.

01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:32.580
Well, this is here once more,
something to be kept in mind.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:36.090
But the important point is that
the energy, that these

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:39.970
two quantities are energetically
conjugate, and

01:11:39.970 --> 01:11:43.800
this is expressed via
this product here.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.180
Let's look at the 2nd
Piola-Kirchhoff

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:47.660
stress tensor now.

01:11:47.660 --> 01:11:51.180
The 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress
tensor in indicial notation is

01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:52.980
defined as shown here.

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.080
And we had already that

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.000
definition early on a viewgraph.

01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.710
In matrix notation, we can
directly say this is the way

01:12:01.710 --> 01:12:03.330
you can also write it.

01:12:03.330 --> 01:12:06.880
Notice that the entries in this
three by three matrix--

01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.350
I'm always thinking about three
components, or rather,

01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:13.430
three dimensional coordinate
space--

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:17.990
the entries here are nothing
else than those elements.

01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:19.990
The entries of this matrix,
of course, are

01:12:19.990 --> 01:12:21.550
those elements here.

01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:24.840
And similarly here, this is
the scalar that we talked

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:26.810
about earlier already.

01:12:26.810 --> 01:12:30.180
If we solve from here for Cauchy
stresses, we directly

01:12:30.180 --> 01:12:32.250
obtain these two equations.

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:35.610
Notice that in this matrix
notation now, we have the

01:12:35.610 --> 01:12:37.150
deformation gradient.

01:12:37.150 --> 01:12:40.660
Whereas in the earlier equation
that we looked at

01:12:40.660 --> 01:12:44.220
here, we had the inverse
deformation gradient.

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.930
Well, these are relations that
we want to keep in mind, and

01:12:47.930 --> 01:12:51.750
that we will be referring to
quiet abundantly later on.

01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:54.070
Let us look at some properties
of the 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff

01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:55.510
stress tensor.

01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:59.400
First of all, t 0
s is symmetric.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.710
While that can be seen directly
by looking at the

01:13:02.710 --> 01:13:07.540
definition, you might want to
prove it to yourself with a

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.340
small example as well.

01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:12.760
t 0 s is invariant under
a rigid body motion,

01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:15.720
translation, and/or rotation.

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.880
Hence, t 0 s only
changes when the

01:13:18.880 --> 01:13:20.740
material is actually deformed.

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:25.900
This is a very important
statement, important fact, I

01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:29.560
should say, and we want to look
at an example just now.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:33.200
t 0 s has no direct physical
interpretation.

01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.740
Well, if you look at some
books, you'll see some

01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:40.090
pictures regarding t 0 s,
sorry, regarding the 2nd

01:13:40.090 --> 01:13:41.400
Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.

01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:43.830
In fact, I have some pictures
in my book,

01:13:43.830 --> 01:13:45.160
in an example there.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:49.250
But, these pictures are quite
far fetched, and they really

01:13:49.250 --> 01:13:52.710
don't give as deep a physical
insight as one would like to

01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:54.600
have with a stress measure.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:59.130
I personally like to now take
almost the attitude of saying,

01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:03.770
well, I accept that there is
no real strong physical

01:14:03.770 --> 01:14:05.890
interpretation of this
stress measure.

01:14:05.890 --> 01:14:08.810
It is used because it's
a convenient stress

01:14:08.810 --> 01:14:10.070
measure to deal with.

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:12.240
We would not, in an engineering
analysis, really

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:14.450
print it out in a computer
program.

01:14:14.450 --> 01:14:17.940
As I said earlier, we would,
of course, want to have the

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:21.060
Cauchy stress as the stress
measure with which we want to

01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.200
design our structure.

01:14:23.200 --> 01:14:27.390
I look at it as a measure that
is convenient to work with in

01:14:27.390 --> 01:14:29.490
the engineering analysis.

01:14:29.490 --> 01:14:31.620
It's interesting, of course,
from a theoretical point of

01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:35.580
view to look at the elements and
to see how large they are,

01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:38.470
how small they are, when
compared to the Cauchy stress,

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:40.890
the real physical stress that
we're interested in.

01:14:40.890 --> 01:14:45.690
But, we don't really need to
look for a strong physical

01:14:45.690 --> 01:14:47.230
interpretation.

01:14:47.230 --> 01:14:48.980
I know we are engineers.

01:14:48.980 --> 01:14:52.660
Engineers like to see pictures,
like to understand

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:53.940
physically what's happening.

01:14:53.940 --> 01:14:58.710
And I can assure you that I've
tried myself quite hard to get

01:14:58.710 --> 01:15:03.090
physical interpretation of this
definition, of this 2nd

01:15:03.090 --> 01:15:04.650
Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.

01:15:04.650 --> 01:15:09.850
But, I have not arrived with
many good results.

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:13.400
The best I could do is given
in my textbook, in the book

01:15:13.400 --> 01:15:15.390
that you are using
as a textbook.

01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:18.880
Let's look at an example here.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:24.580
The example of a four-node
element being stretched and

01:15:24.580 --> 01:15:33.290
rotated as shown here, and then
rotated as shown here.

01:15:33.290 --> 01:15:39.160
Notice that from time t, shown
as the red configuration, to

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.100
time t plus delta t, we have
only a rigid body motion, a

01:15:43.100 --> 01:15:46.150
rotation of 60 degrees.

01:15:46.150 --> 01:15:49.370
Of course, the material would
be subjected to some Cauchy

01:15:49.370 --> 01:15:53.810
stresses, and Cauchy stresses
in this configuration and

01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:57.050
Cauchy stresses in this
configuration.

01:15:57.050 --> 01:16:00.670
Let us see how the Cauchy
stresses, and how the 2nd

01:16:00.670 --> 01:16:05.490
Piola-Kirchhoff stresses evolve
during this motion.

01:16:05.490 --> 01:16:10.040
And on this viewgraph here,
we have summarized that

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.050
information.

01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:15.680
At time t the deformation
gradient is as shown here.

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.710
The Cauchy stresses,
say, are like this.

01:16:18.710 --> 01:16:21.910
Of course, we would have to
introduce the material law, et

01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:22.840
cetera, et cetera.

01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.780
Let us assume that the Cauchy
stresses are like that.

01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:29.100
And then, given the Cauchy
stresses, the deformation

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:36.400
gradient, we calculate the 2nd
Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor.

01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:41.380
Let's say that this is now,
has now been calculated.

01:16:41.380 --> 01:16:45.360
And we do the same at
time t plus delta t.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:48.590
We know that there has, of
course, been additional motion

01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:51.810
from time t to time t plus
delta t, which means that

01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:54.560
these elements here
will change.

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:59.050
And you should now be in a
position to calculate this

01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:01.830
tensor, because you know there
is only a rigid body motion

01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:03.580
that is being applied.

01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:08.590
And then, knowing this tensor,
we can directly also calculate

01:17:08.590 --> 01:17:12.870
the 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff
stress tensor.

01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:15.520
And we can calculate the
Cauchy stress tensor.

01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:17.270
So we can really calculate
all of these.

01:17:17.270 --> 01:17:18.400
And what do we see?

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.830
This is the really
important point.

01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:23.650
We see that the 2nd
Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor

01:17:23.650 --> 01:17:28.550
has not changed from time t
to time t plus delta t.

01:17:28.550 --> 01:17:30.230
This is the important
information

01:17:30.230 --> 01:17:31.690
that I mentioned earlier.

01:17:31.690 --> 01:17:33.350
However, the Cauchy
stress tensor,

01:17:33.350 --> 01:17:35.640
of course, has changed.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.860
The Cauchy stress tensor
has changed.

01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:42.680
One can, of course, prove that
the 2nd Piola-Kirchhoff stress

01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:46.260
tensor does not change when the
material is only subjected

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:47.930
to a rigid body motion.

01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:53.610
And such proof is actually
given in the textbook.

01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:57.150
But this is a simple
application, and it

01:17:57.150 --> 01:18:00.810
exemplifies to you what I
mean by that statement.

01:18:00.810 --> 01:18:03.720
It's an important statement that
you should keep in mind

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.970
as we go along with our further
discussion of the

01:18:06.970 --> 01:18:08.920
mathematical basis
of non-linear

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:10.610
finite element analysis.

01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:14.510
This brings us then to the
end of this lecture.

01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:20.350
I have tried to give you some
of the mathematical bases,

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:24.300
some of the ingredients, rather,
that we are using in

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.910
finite element analysis.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:29.500
We have discussed stress and
strain measures that we will

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:31.860
be encountering further
in the next lectures.

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:33.400
Thank you very much for
your attention.

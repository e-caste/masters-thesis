00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.760
PROFESSOR: Scattering, so
where did we get to last time?

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.220
We did the following things.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.480
This is a recap.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:17.210
We wrote the solution,
a scattering solution,

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.500
or I'll use r.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.850
And this solution
had a wave that

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.500
represented the incoming
wave, and it had what

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.250
we call the scattered wave.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.040
So there were two
pieces to the solution.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.120
We understood that setting
up a scattering problem

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.490
with a central potential.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.100
We had a wave that came in.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:59.370
And then we had
the spherical wave,

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.440
and that was an
outgoing spherical wave.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.610
I've added the subscript
k to represent the wave

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.050
number or the k of the wave.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.850
This is an energy island
state we're calculating.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:23.130
And therefore, the energy is h
bar squared k squared over 2m.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.290
And we're writing the
solution with that energy.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.830
That's an energy island state.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.970
And this solution is, as
written, not an exact solution

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.220
of the Schrodinger equation.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.960
But it's approximately exact
for r much greater than a,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.330
where a is the range
of your potential.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.760
So this is only
valid in those cases.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:54.510
It's not valid near
the scattering.

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.480
For r near zero,
that's not true.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.680
And it's not an exact solution.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.590
This would have been
an exact solution

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.620
of the wave of the time
independent Schrodinger

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.949
equation.

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:12.150
And this without the f would
have been an exact solution.

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.020
But with the f is an
approximate solution.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.030
But that's a solution
that represents

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.730
the physics of scattering.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.440
Then we also showed that the
differential cross section

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:31.620
was in fact given
by this function f.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.130
So this function f is
really what we're after.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.080
And if we know f, we know the
differential cross section,

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.560
which is something we
measure experimentally.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.470
We're scattering particles,
and we detect them.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.480
And the differential
cross section

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.730
tells us about our ability
and the number of particles

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.410
that each detector picks up.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.940
Then we've restricted
ourselves to the case

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.010
of central potentials.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.800
And for those
central potentials,

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.270
v of r with some function
of just the scalar distance.

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:18.840
In such cases, the
cross section would not

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.880
have a fine dependence.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.880
You can imagine
here is the object.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.690
It's vertically symmetric,
and you're shooting waves.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.530
And therefore, the cross
section and the amplitude

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.280
will be independent
of the angle phi.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.870
There's already a direction
picked up by the incoming wave.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.920
But otherwise, it's just that.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.410
So we wrote solutions
in those cases.

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.780
If we are going to
solve, as we will

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.380
today, some of
these problems, you

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.080
need to write
complete solutions.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:10.670
And spherical solutions
are of this form.

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.680
Although, the
relevant ones that we

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.730
will be using will have no m.

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.589
We'll be focusing in solutions
that have m equals zero.

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:27.340
For us, m will be equal to zero.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.490
But these are the
general solutions.

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:36.730
So maybe I might as
well constrain ourselves

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.430
to our case, already
central potential.

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.970
So we will have
solutions of this kind.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:50.040
And these are solutions
of the radial equation.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.280
And we reviewed those and
mentioned that psi of r

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:05.220
would be given by
Al Jl of kr plus Bl

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:13.300
Nl of kr times Yl0 of omega.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.310
This will be our solutions.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.290
These are the spherical
Bessel functions.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:30.920
And those were
solutions that are valid

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:40.160
as long as you are away
from the scattering center.

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.860
So this is valid for
r greater than a.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.020
Indeed, you know that this
could not be valid all the way

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.370
to the center of the part
of where this scattering is

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.440
happening, because ada is
divergent as r goes to zero.

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.460
So this is not the solution.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.930
This is just the solution
for r greater than a,

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.720
where a is the range
of the potential.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.380
Imagine a potential that
totally becomes zero

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.480
after some distance a, then
that is your solution for r

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.920
greater than a.

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.710
That is the most
general solution

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.100
given the spherical
symmetry of this equation.

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.070
Then the last thing
we discussed was

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:44.290
that one part of our
solution, e to the ikz,

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.060
could be written in that
way, because it's a solution.

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.270
So it must admit an
expansion of this form.

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:56.635
So it is like this.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:05.020
You have a sum over all else
with some funny coefficients,

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:10.570
including i to the
l, Yl0 of omega.

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.680
I might as well no put
theta, because there's

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.975
no phi dependence in Yl0.

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:19.570
Jl of kr.

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.280
So this is a pretty
remarkable expression,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.950
we commented last time,
that represents your plane

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.920
waves as spherical waves.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.980
Last, but not least,
we have an expansion

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:46.790
that is useful for
a large argument

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.760
of the spherical
Bessel functions.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.710
They both fall off, like
one over the argument,

00:07:57.710 --> 00:07:59.100
with sines and cosines.

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:09.350
And you see a constant shift
there in this sines and cosines

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.640
of l pi over two.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:20.930
And this is for x much greater
than one, not exact either,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:25.460
but approximate.

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:31.900
OK, so these are some of
our ingredients are ready.

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.510
That's how far we got.

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:39.190
And now, we're going to
try to get more information

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.340
and learn how to solve for fk.

00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:44.470
We need to calculate fk.

00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:47.950
If you have a given problem,
you want the current section,

00:08:47.950 --> 00:08:48.670
you need fk.

00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:56.290
Now the thing we're going
to do is a little intricate,

00:08:56.290 --> 00:08:59.410
a lot of funny
formulas, so let's try

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.230
to keep the ideas
very clear about it.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:03.480
So--

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.580
I'd like to now show you two
mathematical facts about how we

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.070
integrate quantities of motion.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:13.050
Suppose we have an object, let's
call this the i hat direction,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:17.120
and it's moving, and it has
an x component of velocity.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.910
And suppose it starts
at some initial position

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:22.070
and goes at some final position.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.150
And in the initial
position, it was at time ti,

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.910
and the final position
was at t final.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.190
Now, we have two very
important integrals

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.060
that we want to look at
which govern how we describe,

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.020
how we integrate acceleration
with respect to time,

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.390
and also how we'll
integrate acceleration

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:43.620
with respect to space.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.270
Now, recall that our
acceleration, which

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.570
may be a function of
time, is the derivative

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.390
of the x component of
velocity with respect to time.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.570
So, let's first look
at a simple integration

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.420
of acceleration with respect
to time and see what we get.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.965
So, if we integrate
acceleration,

00:01:01.965 --> 00:01:05.780
now I'm going to introduce an
integration variable, dt prime.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.770
And our integration variable
goes from our initial time

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.980
to some final time.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.650
And if we use our
fact that acceleration

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.080
is the derivative
of the velocity,

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:24.410
then we can write this is
dvx, dt prime, dt prime again.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.680
After a while I'll drop
the dummy variables

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.150
and the endpoints
of the integral.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.550
And this simply
becomes the integral

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.520
from t prime, t initial.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.509
t prime equals t
final of dvx prime.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.539
Now notice we've done
a change of variables

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:42.780
in the integration.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.140
So instead of now talking
about the endpoints

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.570
of the integral from
t prime, t initial

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.340
to t final, now what we're doing
is we changed our integration

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.720
variable.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.680
And so what we have is, we
have the velocity integration

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.000
variable is going from
some initial value.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.900
And that integration variable
is going to some final value.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.240
So again, our initial
conditions may

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.830
have some initial velocity
and some final velocity--

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.840
three different
ways of describing

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.460
the initial and final states.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.160
This integral is a very
straightforward integral,

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.820
the x final minus
vx initial, which

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.100
is the change in the x
component of the velocity.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:27.800
And that's our classic
result that we've

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.079
done that the integration
of acceleration

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.010
with respect to time is
a change in velocity.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.290
Now, let's see what
happens as a comparison

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.680
when we integrate our
acceleration not with respect

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.820
to time, but suppose that
it's a function of space.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:46.889
And so now we're
integrating again.

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:47.930
We have a dummy variable.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.388
We have to be
careful, because this

00:02:49.388 --> 00:02:51.260
is the x component
of acceleration,

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.410
but x prime is our
integration variable,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.930
and that's going from
some initial position

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.670
to some final position.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.370
Now, we can write this as
again, make the substitution,

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.970
dx dt, dx prime, going from
the initial to the final.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.980
But now notice we're going to
rewrite this integrand as dvx

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.900
times dx prime, dt prime, dt.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.079
And when we do that, we have
this result that dx prime,

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.320
dt prime is precisely
what we mean by vx.

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.270
Now, I'll introduce some
dummy variables there as well.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:41.910
So what our integrand becomes
is dvx prime, vx prime.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.880
That's not a function,
it's a product

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.510
of a differential
times vx prime.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.300
And now our new
integration variable

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:56.450
is going from some initial
value to some final value.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.000
Once again, this is a
straightforward integral.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.980
For those who haven't
seen integrals like this,

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:05.220
it's just something like
x dx is x squared over 2,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.640
but our integration
variable is vx prime.

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.900
So what we get is
1/2 vx final squared

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.530
minus vx initial squared.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.329
And so what we see here is two
fundamentally different facts

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.890
that if you integrate
acceleration

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:25.740
with respect to time, you
get the change in velocity.

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.560
But if you integrate
acceleration

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.370
with respect to space, you
get 1/2 times the change

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.950
not of velocity, but
of the x component

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.870
of the velocity squared.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.990
And both of these facts
are central to how

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.230
we'll analyze the
concept of work

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.495
and how we applied
Newton's second law.

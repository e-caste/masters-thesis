00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.290
PROFESSOR: So I want to begin
by reviewing a little bit what

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.920
I said last time in terms
of this overview lecture.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.580
And then we'll finish
the overview lecture.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.240
So summary of last lecture
is actually on five slides.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.359
It's not all on this one slide.

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:43.900
We started by talking about the
standard Big Bang, by which I

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.590
mean the Big Bang without
thinking about inflation.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.340
And I pointed out that
it really describes

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.730
only the aftermath of a bang.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.890
It begins with the
description of the universe

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.870
as a hot, dense soup of
particles which more or less

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.500
uniformly fills the
entire available space,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.150
and the entire system
is already expanding.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.140
Cosmic inflation is a prequel
to the conventional Big Bang

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.770
story.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.250
It describes how
repulsive gravity, which

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.870
in the context of
general relativity,

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.136
can happen as a consequence
of negative pressure.

00:01:24.136 --> 00:01:25.510
This repulsive
gravity could have

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.310
driven a tiny patch
of the early universe

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.800
into a gigantic burst of
exponential expansion.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.750
And our visible
universe would then

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.930
be the aftermath of that event.

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.530
As this happened, the
total energy of this patch

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.810
would be very small and
could even be identically 0.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.870
And the way that's possible
is caused by the fact

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:53.380
that the gravitational
field that fills the space

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.580
has a negative
contribution to the energy.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.710
And as far as we can tell
in our real universe,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.209
there are about
equal to each other.

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:02.250
They could cancel each other
exactly as far as we can tell.

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.790
So the total energy
could in fact

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.000
be exactly zero,
which is what allows

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.950
one to build a huge
universe starting

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.130
from either nothing
or almost nothing.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.040
Inflation.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.660
The next item is
evidence for inflation.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.700
Why do we think there's
at least a good chance

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.700
that our universe
underwent inflation?

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.290
And I pointed out three items.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.270
The first was that inflation
could explain the large scale

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.180
uniformity that we
observe in the universe

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.760
and that large
scale uniformity is

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.230
seen most clearly in the
cosmic microwave background

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.700
radiation, which is observed
to be uniform to one

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.280
part in $100,000, that is same
intensity all across the sky

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.490
no matter what direction
you look, once you account

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.085
for the Earth's motion,
to an accuracy of one part

00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:50.300
in 100,000.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.920
Secondly, inflation can explain
a rather remarkable fact

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.860
about this quantity
omega, where omega

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.730
is defined as the actual
mass density of the universe

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.500
rho divided by rho critical,
the critical mass density which

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.330
is the density that would make
the universe precisely flat.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.520
The statement that that
ratio is equal to 1 we know

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.880
is accurate to about 15
decimal places at one second

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.150
after the Big Bang.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.960
And prior to inflation,
we didn't really

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.460
have any explanation
for that at all.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.770
But inflation
drives omega to one

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.670
and gives us an explanation
for why, therefore,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.232
started out so
extraordinarily close to 1.

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:30.690
And in fact, it
makes a prediction.

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.580
We'd expect that if
inflation is right,

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.160
omega should still be one today.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.900
And we now have measured omega
to be 1.0010 plus or minus

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.730
0.0065, which I
think is fabulous.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.110
Finally, inflation
gives an explanation

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.440
for the inhomogeneities
that we see in the universe.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.550
It explains them as
quantum fluctuations which

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.860
happened during the inflationary
process and, most importantly

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.690
really, as inflation was
ending, the quantum fluctuations

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.810
cause inflation to go
on for a little bit

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.110
longer in some
regions than others.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.890
And that sets up
these inhomogeneities.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.150
Today, we can see
these inhomogeneities

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.996
most accurately.

00:04:14.996 --> 00:04:17.579
inhomogeneities, of course, are
huge at the level of galaxies,

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:18.470
so they're obvious.

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.339
But it's hard to connect
them to the early universe.

00:04:21.339 --> 00:04:24.620
So we can make our most
precise comparison between what

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.870
we observe and theories
of the early universe

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.350
by making careful observations
of the cosmic background

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:33.890
radiation itself, which has
these ripples in the intensity,

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.450
It is not quite uniform.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:39.830
There really are ripples at the
level of one part in 100,000,

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.030
which can now be observed.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.110
And inflation makes
a clear prediction

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.310
for the spectrum
of those ripples,

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.590
how the intensity should
vary with wavelength.

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.540
And I showed you this graph last
time from the Planck satellite.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.300
The agreement between the
prediction and the theory

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.080
is really marvelous.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.860
So we'll be coming back to that
near the end of the course.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.960
Finally, in the last
lecture, I began

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.970
to talk about inflation and
the possible implications

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:17.650
for a multiverse, the idea that
our universe might be embedded

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.470
in a much larger
thing consisting

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.920
of many universes, which
we call a multiverse.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.810
And the key point is that
most inflation models

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.440
tend to become eternal.

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.000
And that is once inflation
starts, it never stops.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.650
And the reason for
that, basically,

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.500
is that the metastable
material, this repulsive gravity

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.780
material that's causing
the inflation, decays,

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.480
but it also
exponentially expands.

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.970
And for typical models,
the exponential expansion

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:51.060
completely overpowers the decay.

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:54.590
So even though it's an
unstable material that decays,

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.290
the total volume of it actually
increases exponentially

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:01.030
with time rather than decreases.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.540
Decays happen however,
and wherever decay happen,

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.100
it forms what we call
a pocket universe.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.100
We would be living in one
of those pocket universes.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.690
And the number of
pocket universes

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.040
grows exponentially with time as
the whole system grows and goes

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.240
on, as far as we
can tell, forever.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.060
And that is the picture
of the multiverse

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.550
that inflation tends to lead to.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.630
Finally, this is my
last summary slide

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.880
and then we'll
start new material.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.620
At the very end of
lecture, I talked

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:38.460
about a problem, which is very
important in our present day

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.130
thinking about
physics and cosmology,

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:45.650
and that is the nightmare that
this discovery of dark energy

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:46.250
leads to.

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.050
What was discovered
at about 1998

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:53.820
is that the expansion
of the universe

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:56.450
is not slowing down under
the influence of gravity

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:59.090
as one might expect,
but Instead, it's

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.380
actually accelerating.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.520
The universe is expanding
faster and faster.

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.430
And that indicates
that space today

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.190
is filled with some repulsive
gravity material, which

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:11.380
we call the dark energy.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:14.170
And the simplest interpretation
of the dark energy

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.570
is that it simply vacuum energy,
the energy of empty space.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.600
Space does have an
energy density that

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.630
have exactly the
properties that we observe,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.495
so it seems natural to
draw that connection.

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.300
Vacuum energy, at first,
might seem surprising.

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.030
If a vacuum's empty, why should
it have any mass density?

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.584
But in a quantum field theory,
it's really not surprising

00:07:36.584 --> 00:07:38.000
because in a quantum
field theory,

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.974
the vacuum is really not empty.

00:07:39.974 --> 00:07:41.390
In a quantum field
theory, there's

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.330
no such thing as
actual emptiness.

00:07:44.330 --> 00:07:48.440
Instead, in the vacuum, one has
constant quantum fluctuations

00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.580
of fields.

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:54.160
And in our current theory
of particle physics,

00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.040
the standard model
of particle physics,

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.660
there's even one particular
field called the Higgs field,

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.510
which has a non-zero
mean value in the vacuum

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:04.160
besides fluctuations.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.010
So the vacuum is a
very complicated state.

00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.720
What makes it the
vacuum is simply

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.620
that it's alleged to be the
state of lowest possible energy

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:12.474
density, but that
doesn't have to be zero

00:08:12.474 --> 00:08:13.890
and doesn't even
look like there's

00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:16.210
any reason why it
should be zero.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:19.550
So there's no problem
buying the fact

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.040
that maybe the vacuum does
have a non-zero energy density.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.290
The problem comes
about though when

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:28.230
we try to understand the
magnitude of this vacuum

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.250
energy.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.250
If it was going to have
a vacuum energy density,

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.190
we'd expect it to be
vastly larger than what

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.090
is observed in the
form of the expansion

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.929
acceleration of the universe.

00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:42.610
So a typical order of magnitude
in the particle physics

00:08:42.610 --> 00:08:45.400
model for the vacuum
energy is, in fact,

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.980
about a full 120
orders of magnitude

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:51.260
larger than the
number that's implied

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:53.590
by the acceleration
of the universe.

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:56.990
So that is a big problem.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:59.940
I began to talk about a possible
resolution to that problem.

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.330
It's only a possible resolution.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:03.765
Nobody has really
settled on this.

00:09:03.765 --> 00:09:05.140
But there's a
possible resolution

00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.080
which comes out
of String theory,

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.685
and in particular
from this idea, which

00:09:09.685 --> 00:09:12.510
is called the landscape
of String theory.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:15.970
Most String theorists believe
that String theory has

00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:19.140
no unique vacuum,
but instead, there's

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:23.650
a colossal number, perhaps
something like 10 to the 500,

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.990
different metastable
states, which

00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:30.230
even though they are metastable,
are incredibly long-lived,

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:34.120
long-lived compared to the age
of the universe as we know it.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.790
So any one of these 10 to
the 500 different states

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.390
could serve as effectively
the vacuum for one

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:42.774
of these pocket universes.

00:09:42.774 --> 00:09:44.190
And the different
pocket universes

00:09:44.190 --> 00:09:51.310
would presumably fill the
whole set of possible vacua

00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:55.880
in the landscape, giving reality
to all these possibilities

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.080
that come about
in String theory.

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:03.050
And in particular, each
different type of vacuum

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:05.910
would have its own
vacuum energy density.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.050
And because there are
both positive and negative

00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.330
contributions-- I think I
didn't read that out loud--

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.579
but there are both positive
and negative contributions

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.700
that arise in quantum
field theories.

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.830
So the vacuum energy
of a typical state

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.750
could be either
positive or negative.

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.910
And what we would
expect of these 10

00:10:20.910 --> 00:10:23.380
to the 500 different
vacua is that they

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:26.010
would have a range
of energy densities

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.610
that would range from something
like minus 10 to the 120

00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:34.264
to plus 10 to the 120
times the observed value.

00:10:34.264 --> 00:10:35.930
So the observed value
would be in there,

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.700
but would be an incredibly
small fraction of the universes.

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:39.200
Yes?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.518
AUDIENCE: Does this mean that
so many pocket universes could

00:10:42.518 --> 00:10:46.073
be closed and opened as well
in terms of their geometry?

00:10:46.073 --> 00:10:47.769
Or--

00:10:47.769 --> 00:10:49.310
PROFESSOR: They're
actually predicted

00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:52.130
to be open due to complications
about how they form,

00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:54.350
which I'm not going to go into.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.510
But they should all be open, but
very close to flat for the ones

00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:59.200
that under a lot of inflation.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.930
So they'd be
indistinguishable from flat,

00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:03.710
but technically, they'd be open.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:04.533
Yes?

00:11:04.533 --> 00:11:08.397
AUDIENCE: Is the minus 10 to
the 120 plus 10 to the 120 just

00:11:08.397 --> 00:11:10.812
chosen because we're off
520 orders of magnitude,

00:11:10.812 --> 00:11:13.612
or is it predicted
somewhere else?

00:11:13.612 --> 00:11:15.195
PROFESSOR: Well,
when we say we're off

00:11:15.195 --> 00:11:17.940
by 120 orders of magnitude,
the more precise statement

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:21.740
is that the estimate of what
a typical range of the energy

00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:26.150
should be is 10 to 120
times the observed value.

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.320
So this is basically just
a restatement of that.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.280
And you might
wonder why I didn't

00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:35.150
put 5 times 10 to the
120, but in fact, the 120

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.230
itself is only accurate
to within a few orders

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:39.220
of magnitude, so 5
times that wouldn't

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:40.850
have made any difference
in the way one

00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:42.320
actually interprets
those numbers.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:49.280
10 to the 123 is probably
slightly more accurate number

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:50.390
actually.

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:52.381
But this is good enough
for our purposes.

00:11:52.381 --> 00:11:52.880
Yes?

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:53.852
AUDIENCE: Just a
general question

00:11:53.852 --> 00:11:55.310
about inflation properties.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:58.226
We think of attractive
gravity as driving

00:11:58.226 --> 00:12:01.110
the motion of objects
through space.

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.372
So why do we think
of repulsive gravity

00:12:03.372 --> 00:12:07.150
like to drive the
expanse of space itself?

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:09.150
PROFESSOR: Well, for one
thing, it does actually

00:12:09.150 --> 00:12:10.200
behave differently.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.420
Repulsive gravity,
repulsive gravity

00:12:12.420 --> 00:12:14.000
that appears in
general relativity,

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.170
is not just ordinary gravity
with the opposite sign.

00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:18.620
Ordinary gravity
has the property

00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:21.950
that if I have two objects to
attract each other with a force

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.390
proportional to the
masses of those objects.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.850
This repulsive
gravity is actually

00:12:26.850 --> 00:12:31.140
an effect caused by the negative
pressure in the space between.

00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:33.020
So if I have two
objects, they will

00:12:33.020 --> 00:12:35.990
start to accelerate apart
by the amount that's

00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:38.150
totally independent
of the masses.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:40.680
This is not really the
masses that's causing it.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.450
So the whole force was
completely different,

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:47.010
so we can't really
just compare them.

00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:50.280
In either case, when
everything is moving apart,

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.080
it's really a
matter of viewpoint

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.069
when you think of the
whole space as expanding

00:12:55.069 --> 00:12:56.610
or whether you think
of the particles

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.620
as moving through space.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.830
In relativity, there's no
way to put a needle on space,

00:13:01.830 --> 00:13:05.170
put a pen in it and
say this is stationary.

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:08.520
So we really can't say that
the space is moving or not.

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.660
In cosmology, we usually
find that the simpler picture

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:13.850
and the one that we
will generally use

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:15.922
is that space expands
with the matter.

00:13:15.922 --> 00:13:17.380
It gives a much
simpler description

00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.255
of how things behave.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.470
Good question.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:23.660
Yes?

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:26.380
AUDIENCE: I have a question
going back a few slides.

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.440
PROFESSOR: Sure, you
want me to go back.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.410
AUDIENCE: How the energy
of the early universe

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.400
seemed to be close to zero.

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.750
Are there theoretical
models that would explain

00:13:36.750 --> 00:13:39.645
or that would say it
should be exactly 0?

00:13:39.645 --> 00:13:40.770
PROFESSOR: Yeah, there are.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.050
I didn't mention it.

00:13:42.050 --> 00:13:45.940
But if the universe is closed,
which is a possibility.

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:48.602
Even if it's very nearly flat,
it could still be closed.

00:13:48.602 --> 00:13:50.810
If it were closed, it would
have exactly zero energy.

00:13:55.220 --> 00:13:56.120
Yes?

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.334
AUDIENCE: So the
cosmic background,

00:13:58.334 --> 00:14:00.636
microwave background,
picks ups that it's

00:14:00.636 --> 00:14:03.480
pretty similar in all
directions once correct for it.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.210
And this leads to the thought
that the cosmological principle

00:14:06.210 --> 00:14:09.270
all over the universe
is pretty identical.

00:14:09.270 --> 00:14:11.640
Is it possible that
we are actually

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:15.316
located in just a smaller
like circular pathway

00:14:15.316 --> 00:14:19.244
and it may be different
than [? allowed. ?]

00:14:19.244 --> 00:14:20.660
And there's many
of these patches,

00:14:20.660 --> 00:14:24.760
so we-- there's actually
like a speckled form.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.580
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:27.038
So if you didn't
hear the question,

00:14:27.038 --> 00:14:29.820
I was asked if it's possible
that the universe is not

00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.120
really homogeneous on
a very large scales,

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.142
but really speckled, just
that speckles are large

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:36.850
and our speckle might
look very different

00:14:36.850 --> 00:14:38.580
from other speckles
that are far away.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:40.030
And that was the question.

00:14:40.030 --> 00:14:41.595
And the answer is certainly
if the multiverse picture

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:42.040
is right.

00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:44.090
That is exactly the case
that's being predicted.

00:14:44.090 --> 00:14:45.770
These other pocket
universes could

00:14:45.770 --> 00:14:48.540
be viewed as other
speckles in your language,

00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:51.420
and they'd be very different
from what we've observed.

00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:55.820
So inflation actually
changes one's attitude

00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:57.870
about this particular question.

00:14:57.870 --> 00:15:00.840
Back in the old days,
before inflation,

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:04.180
the uniformity of the
universe had no explanation,

00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:06.420
so it became a postulate.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.750
And nobody postulates
that something

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.792
is uniform on that scale.

00:15:09.792 --> 00:15:11.333
If you are going to
make a postulate,

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:14.040
you just postulate that
the universe is uniform.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.950
So that was the postulate
that was in use.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.350
But now that we think of the
homogeneity of the universe

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:24.260
as being generated by a
dynamical process, inflation,

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.180
then, it's a natural
question to ask,

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.900
what is the scale
of the homogeneity

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:29.950
that that generates.

00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:31.470
And it's certainly
a scale that's

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.140
much larger than
what we can observe.

00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:35.280
So we don't really expect
to see inhomogeneity

00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:38.860
as caused by different
pockets of inflation,

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.700
but the model seems to
make it very plausible that

00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:45.070
is what we would see if
we could see far enough.

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:54.250
Any other questions while
we're on a little break here?

00:15:54.250 --> 00:15:55.130
Yes?

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.755
AUDIENCE: If the
universe is expanding,

00:15:56.755 --> 00:16:00.105
then I think like we are
expanding as well, so how can

00:16:00.105 --> 00:16:01.775
we observe the change
from a distance,

00:16:01.775 --> 00:16:04.327
in particular everything
is increasing scale?

00:16:04.327 --> 00:16:04.910
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:07.020
That's a very good question.

00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:09.430
The question was if the
universe is expanding,

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:10.890
then the universe is everything.

00:16:10.890 --> 00:16:12.340
So everything is expanding.

00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:14.590
And if everything's expanding,
when you compare things

00:16:14.590 --> 00:16:16.950
with rulers, they
have the same length.

00:16:16.950 --> 00:16:20.590
So how would you even observe
that everything was expanding?

00:16:20.590 --> 00:16:22.660
And the answer to
that is that when

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:24.470
we say the universe
is expanding,

00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:27.717
we're not really saying that
everything is expanding.

00:16:27.717 --> 00:16:29.300
When we say the
universe is expanding,

00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:31.716
we really are saying that the
galaxies are getting further

00:16:31.716 --> 00:16:34.840
apart from each other,
but individual atoms

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.080
are not getting bigger.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.270
The length of a
ruler, determined

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:40.440
by the number of atoms
and how those atoms move

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.980
to ground state, does not
expand with the universe.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:47.040
So the expansion is
now partially driven

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.880
by the repulsive
gravity that exists

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.360
now, which is causing the
universe to accelerate.

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:54.580
But most of the expansion is
really just a residual velocity

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:57.770
from the Big Bang,
whatever caused it then.

00:16:57.770 --> 00:16:59.390
I would assert inflation.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.425
And it's just a matter
of coasting outward, not

00:17:01.425 --> 00:17:03.980
being pulled outward,
and that coasting outward

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:07.626
does not cause
atoms to get bigger.

00:17:07.626 --> 00:17:08.126
Yes?

00:17:08.126 --> 00:17:10.771
AUDIENCE: Is the current
idea that the expansion,

00:17:10.771 --> 00:17:13.699
like the acceleration,
is indefinite or are we

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:16.827
going to reach a stop point?

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:17.410
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:17:17.410 --> 00:17:20.839
What will be the ultimate
future, I'm being asked here.

00:17:20.839 --> 00:17:25.220
And the answer, as you might
guess, is nobody really knows.

00:17:25.220 --> 00:17:28.230
But in the context of the kind
of models I'm talking about,

00:17:28.230 --> 00:17:30.620
there is a pretty
definite answer,

00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.782
which is that our
pocket universe--

00:17:33.782 --> 00:17:35.740
I'll answer at the level
of our pocket universe

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:38.930
and I'll answer at the level
of the multiverse as a hole.

00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:40.970
At the level of our
pocket universe,

00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:43.770
our pocket universe
will thin out.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:45.790
Life will eventually
become impossible

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:48.465
because matter density
will be too low.

00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:53.000
It will probably decay.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.530
Our vacuum is probably
not absolutely stable.

00:17:55.530 --> 00:17:57.690
Very few things 2
String theory are,

00:17:57.690 --> 00:18:00.530
if something like String
theory is the right theory.

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:02.050
But even though it
will be decaying,

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.910
it will be expanding still
faster than it decays.

00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.260
So the decay will cause
holes in our universe.

00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:09.256
It will become
like Swiss cheese.

00:18:09.256 --> 00:18:10.880
But the universe, as
a whole, will just

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:13.090
go on exponentially
expanding, perhaps

00:18:13.090 --> 00:18:15.860
forever, as far as
we can tell, forever.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:18.710
The multiverse is a
more vibrant object.

00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:20.440
The multiverse,
as I always said,

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:24.060
would continue to generate
new pocket universes forever.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.230
So the multiverse
would forever be alive

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.620
even though each pocket
universe in the multiverse

00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:33.640
would form at some time
and then ultimately die,

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.610
die of thinning out
into nothingness.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:39.473
Yes?

00:18:39.473 --> 00:18:41.405
AUDIENCE: Just to add to that.

00:18:41.405 --> 00:18:44.786
Do you believe that maybe
it's a cyclic process?

00:18:44.786 --> 00:18:49.616
So it expand and decay and
then come back [? yet again ?]

00:18:49.616 --> 00:18:51.777
and then happen all over again?

00:18:51.777 --> 00:18:52.360
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.820
The question is could it
be a cyclic process that

00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.090
expands, reaches maximum,
comes back and crunches,

00:18:57.090 --> 00:18:58.410
and expands again.

00:18:58.410 --> 00:19:00.490
That is certainly a
possibility, and there

00:19:00.490 --> 00:19:03.240
is some people who
take it very seriously.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.480
I don't see any evidence for it.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.520
And furthermore, there
never really was and still

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.720
really isn't a reasonable
theory of the bounce

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:16.165
that would have to be
a part of that theory.

00:19:16.165 --> 00:19:16.665
Yeah?

00:19:16.665 --> 00:19:18.778
AUDIENCE: But would it be
the expansion overtaking

00:19:18.778 --> 00:19:23.640
the decay in our own vacuum
that our universe exists

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:29.350
in, our own little pocket
vacuums of ultimate decay

00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:33.246
within our system create more
little pocket universes--

00:19:33.246 --> 00:19:34.220
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:34.640
PROFESSOR: Within.

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.139
Yes.

00:19:35.139 --> 00:19:37.670
Yeah, that's correct.

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:42.120
They would not be a big fraction
of the volume of our universe,

00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.200
but, yes.

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.210
The pieces in our universe
that might decay in the future

00:19:46.210 --> 00:19:48.442
would produce new
pocket universes.

00:19:48.442 --> 00:19:50.900
Most of them would be very low
energy pocket universes that

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:53.930
would presumably not create
life, but some of them

00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.920
could nonetheless have a high
enough energy to create life.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.080
So we would expect
new, thriving universes

00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.010
to appear out of our
own pocket universe

00:20:06.010 --> 00:20:11.800
as it reaches this
expansion death.

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:12.300
Yes?

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.750
AUDIENCE: What does
distinguishes different vacua

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.735
besides the
cosmological constant?

00:20:17.735 --> 00:20:19.610
PROFESSOR: The question
is what distinguishes

00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:23.260
the different vacua besides
the cosmological constant.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:28.200
And the answer is that they can
distinguish in many, many ways.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.360
What fundamentally
distinguishes them

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:32.910
is the rearrangement
of the innards

00:20:32.910 --> 00:20:37.160
within the space, maybe a little
bit more precise without trying

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.770
to get into details
which I probably

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.510
don't understand either.

00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:43.960
But what's going on is that
String theory fundamentally

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.500
says that space has nine
dimensions, not the three

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.730
that we observe.

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:50.220
And the way the
nine becomes three

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.370
is that the extra
dimensions get twisted up

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:56.420
into tiny little knots, so
they occupy too small a length

00:20:56.420 --> 00:20:57.665
to ever be seen.

00:20:57.665 --> 00:20:59.040
But there are many
different ways

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.677
of twisting up those
extra dimensions,

00:21:00.677 --> 00:21:03.010
and that's really what leads
to these very large numbers

00:21:03.010 --> 00:21:04.730
of possible vacua.

00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:08.060
The extra dimensions are
twisted up differently.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:13.260
So that means that as
far as the low energy

00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:14.890
physics in these
different vacua--

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:16.640
practically everything
could be different,

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.598
even the dimension of
space could be different.

00:21:18.598 --> 00:21:23.300
You could have different numbers
of dimensions compactified.

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.970
And the whole particle
spectrum would

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:28.590
be different because what we
view as a particle is really

00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:30.890
just the fluctuation of vacuum.

00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:33.656
And if you have a different
structure to the vacuum itself,

00:21:33.656 --> 00:21:35.280
the kinds of particles
that exist in it

00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:37.180
could be totally different.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.919
So the physics inside
these pocket universe

00:21:39.919 --> 00:21:41.710
could look tremendously
different from what

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:44.240
we observe even though
that we're predicating

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.190
the whole description
on the idea

00:21:46.190 --> 00:21:48.160
that, ultimately, it's
the same laws of physics

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.076
that apply everywhere.

00:21:55.421 --> 00:21:56.900
Other questions?

00:21:56.900 --> 00:21:57.400
Yes?

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.316
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:22:38.807 --> 00:22:39.390
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:22:39.390 --> 00:22:43.640
I think you're asking about
if we have a small patch, then

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.110
that goes inflation and the rest
doesn't, how does the patch end

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.740
up dominating because
it started out

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:51.630
with just a small
fraction of the particles.

00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.088
Doesn't it still have the same
small fraction of particles?

00:22:54.088 --> 00:22:57.042
Is that what you're asking?

00:22:57.042 --> 00:22:58.042
AUDIENCE: Well, I guess.

00:22:58.042 --> 00:23:01.938
If you start out with the
smooth particles being

00:23:01.938 --> 00:23:05.347
the excessive matter,
and one of the particles

00:23:05.347 --> 00:23:07.782
behaves and the other
two particles [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:07.782 --> 00:23:11.200
even if it's still
just two particles?

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:11.990
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:14.346
It isn't the number of
particles conserved, basically,

00:23:14.346 --> 00:23:16.470
as all this happens, is I
think what you're asking.

00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:18.960
AUDIENCE: Well, even if it
eventually [? is called ?]

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:26.365
expanded wave because the
second part will [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:26.365 --> 00:23:27.490
PROFESSOR: Well, let's see.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.780
I'm having a little
trouble hearing you.

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.570
But let me make a definite--
let me make a broader statement,

00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:32.070
and you can tell
me if I've answered

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:34.520
what you're asking about or not.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.960
When one of these
patches undergoes

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.140
the exponential
expansion of inflation,

00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:42.490
the energy is really
not very well described

00:23:42.490 --> 00:23:43.490
as particles at all.

00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:45.700
It's really described
in terms of fields.

00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:48.800
And fields sometimes behave
like particles, but not always.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.290
And in this case-- in principle,
there's a particle description

00:23:52.290 --> 00:23:54.540
too, but it's not
nearly as obvious

00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:56.260
as the field description.

00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:59.365
So you have energy stored in
fields and the region grows.

00:23:59.365 --> 00:24:00.740
The energy stored
in those fields

00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:02.770
actually increases
as the region goes.

00:24:02.770 --> 00:24:05.430
The energy density remains
approximately constant.

00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:07.130
And that sounds like
it would violate

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:09.600
the conservation of energy,
but we discussed the fact

00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.410
that what saves
conservation of energy

00:24:12.410 --> 00:24:15.680
and allows this to happen in
spite of conservation of energy

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.770
is that as the
region expands, it

00:24:17.770 --> 00:24:21.420
is filled by a gravitational
field, which is now occupying

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:24.540
a larger and larger volume, and
that gravitational field has

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.650
a negative energy density.

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:29.370
So the total energy, which
is what has to be conserved,

00:24:29.370 --> 00:24:32.120
remains very small
and perhaps zero,

00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.100
and the region can
grow without limit

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:39.370
while still having this very
small or zero total energy.

00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:41.690
Then, eventually it
decays and when it decays,

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.814
it produces new particles,
and the colossal number

00:24:44.814 --> 00:24:46.730
of new particles, and
those would be the stuff

00:24:46.730 --> 00:24:48.920
that we would be made out of.

00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:51.740
And that number is vastly larger
than the number of particles

00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.210
that may have been
in this region

00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.491
when the inflation started.

00:24:55.491 --> 00:24:55.990
Yes?

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:59.894
AUDIENCE: So does the emergence
of [INAUDIBLE] just purely

00:24:59.894 --> 00:25:02.334
a conservation of energy?

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:05.262
Like, what do you need to
make these [? an organism ?],

00:25:05.262 --> 00:25:09.574
the negative energy,
zero [INAUDIBLE] I guess.

00:25:09.574 --> 00:25:11.740
PROFESSOR: Are you saying
the conservation of energy

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.420
maybe controls the whole
show, and that this is really

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.540
the only thing consistent
with conservation of energy?

00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.890
I think that's probably
an exaggeration

00:25:21.890 --> 00:25:25.780
because if nothing happened,
that would conserve energy too.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:29.330
So I think one needs more than
just the conservation of energy

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:33.120
to be able to describe how the
universe is going to evolve.

00:25:37.621 --> 00:25:38.120
OK.

00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.215
Let me continue.

00:25:46.284 --> 00:25:49.270
Get back to the beginning
there, back to the end.

00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:49.770
OK.

00:25:49.770 --> 00:25:52.420
So I just finished talking about
the landscape of String theory

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.530
and how it offers all
these possible vacua.

00:25:54.530 --> 00:25:58.960
So in particular, and this is
now the new stuff, if there

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.340
are 10 to the 500 vacua of
String theory, for example.

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:05.950
We don't really know the number,
but something crazy like that.

00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:09.770
And if only one part in
10 to the 120 of them

00:26:09.770 --> 00:26:12.680
have this very small energy,
thus the energy densities

00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:17.750
are spread from plus
10 to the 120 times

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:22.429
what we observe to minus 10 to
the 120 times what we observe.

00:26:22.429 --> 00:26:23.970
That would mean that
what we observed

00:26:23.970 --> 00:26:27.990
would be a narrow slice in the
middle there occupying about 10

00:26:27.990 --> 00:26:32.382
to the minus 120th of the
length of that spread.

00:26:32.382 --> 00:26:34.340
We would then expect--
and all this, of course,

00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.675
is very crude estimates.

00:26:36.675 --> 00:26:38.550
It's not really the
numbers that's important,

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:41.406
it's whether or not
you believe the ideas.

00:26:41.406 --> 00:26:44.640
But we'd expect then that
about 10 to the minus 120

00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.610
of the different vacua would
have an acceptably low vacuum

00:26:48.610 --> 00:26:50.486
energy density.

00:26:50.486 --> 00:26:52.360
But that's still a
colossal number because 10

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:55.160
to the minus 120
times 10 to the 500--

00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:58.540
you add the exponents--
is 10 to the 380.

00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:01.000
So we would still predict
that even though they'd

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.320
be very rare, there might be
10 to the 380 different kinds

00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.470
of vacua, all which would
have a vacuum energy density

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.580
as well as what we observe.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:15.290
So there's no problem finding,
in the landscape, vacua

00:27:15.290 --> 00:27:18.160
whose energy density is
as low as what we observe.

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.780
But then there's the question
if they're so incredibly rare,

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:23.260
wouldn't it take
a miracle for us

00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:27.070
to be living in one of these
incredibly unusual vacua

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.520
with such an extraordinarily
low vacuum energy density.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.250
That then leads to
what is sometimes

00:27:33.250 --> 00:27:38.490
called Anthropic considerations
or perhaps a selection effect.

00:27:38.490 --> 00:27:41.920
And to see how that works and
make it sound not as crazy

00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:43.890
as it might sound
otherwise, I want

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:46.620
to begin by giving an example
where I think one could really

00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.560
say that this effect happens.

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:53.820
And that is suppose we just
look at our own position

00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:56.770
in our own visible
universe and look at,

00:27:56.770 --> 00:27:59.432
for example, the mass density.

00:27:59.432 --> 00:28:01.140
Where we're actually
living is incredibly

00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.723
unusual in many ways, but one
of the ways we could talk about,

00:28:03.723 --> 00:28:05.740
which is just simple
and quantitative,

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.050
is the mass density.

00:28:07.050 --> 00:28:09.990
The mass density of the
things around this room

00:28:09.990 --> 00:28:14.200
is on the order of one gram per
centimeter cubed give or take

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.217
a factor of 10.

00:28:15.217 --> 00:28:16.800
The factor of 10 is
not very important

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.144
for I'm talking about here.

00:28:18.144 --> 00:28:19.560
The point is that
the average mass

00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.890
density of the universe, the
visible universe, is about 10

00:28:22.890 --> 00:28:25.610
to the minus 30 grams
per centimeter cubed.

00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:30.000
It's really unbelievable
how empty the universe is.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.630
It's actually a far lower mass
density than is possible for us

00:28:33.630 --> 00:28:36.990
to achieve in laboratories
on Earth with the best vacua

00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:40.130
that we can make in
our laboratories.

00:28:40.130 --> 00:28:43.720
So where we're living
has a mass density of 10

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.360
to the 30 times the average
of the visible universe.

00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.070
So we're not living in a typical
place in our visible universe.

00:28:51.070 --> 00:28:54.470
We're living in an
extraordinarily atypical place

00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:56.160
within our visible universe.

00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.224
And we can ask how
would we explain that.

00:28:59.224 --> 00:29:00.890
Is it just a matter
of chance that we're

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:03.550
living in a place that's
such a high mass density?

00:29:03.550 --> 00:29:05.805
Doesn't seem very likely
if it's a matter of chance.

00:29:05.805 --> 00:29:06.500
Is it luck?

00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.560
Is it divine
providence, whatever?

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.460
I think most of us would admit
that it's probably a selection

00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.450
effect.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:15.020
That that's where life happens.

00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:18.740
Life doesn't happen throughout
most of the visible universe,

00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:20.930
but in these rare
places, like the surface

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.280
of our planet, which is
special in more ways than just

00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.370
the mass density, but
the mass density alone

00:29:25.370 --> 00:29:28.950
is enough to make it
extraordinarily special.

00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:31.020
We're off by a factor
of 10 to the 30

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.890
from the average
of our environment.

00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.420
So if we're willing
to explain why

00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:40.560
we live in such an unusual place
within our visible universe

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:44.000
and explain that as simply
a requirement for life,

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:47.450
then it doesn't seem to be such
a stretch to maybe imagine--

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:51.542
and it was Steve Weinberg who
first emphasized this in 1987.

00:29:51.542 --> 00:29:53.250
Certainly not the
first person to say it,

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:56.310
but the first person to
say it and have people

00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:58.670
sometimes believe him.

00:29:58.670 --> 00:30:01.940
He pointed out that may be the
low energy-- the low vacuum

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:05.190
energy density could be
explained the same way.

00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:07.490
If we're not living
in a typical place

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:10.090
within our visible
universe, there's

00:30:10.090 --> 00:30:14.410
no reason for similar
ideas to expect

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:16.370
that we should be living
in a typical place

00:30:16.370 --> 00:30:18.150
in the multiverse.

00:30:18.150 --> 00:30:21.720
Maybe only a small fraction
of these different types

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.820
of pocket universe's
can support life.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.290
And maybe the only
way to have life

00:30:27.290 --> 00:30:31.170
is to have a very small value
for the vacuum energy density.

00:30:31.170 --> 00:30:33.700
And there is some
physics behind that.

00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:38.050
Remember this vacuum energy
density drives expansion--

00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.000
acceleration, I should say.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.210
So if the vacuum energy density
were significantly larger

00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:48.070
than what we
observe, the universe

00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:49.594
would accelerate
incredibly rapidly

00:30:49.594 --> 00:30:51.010
and would fly apart
before there'd

00:30:51.010 --> 00:30:53.280
be any time for anything
interesting to happen

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.306
like galaxies forming.

00:30:55.306 --> 00:30:57.430
Weinberg based his arguments
here on the assumption

00:30:57.430 --> 00:31:00.340
that galaxies are a
necessity for life.

00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:00.840
Yes?

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.820
AUDIENCE: So that's
what I was going to ask.

00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:05.112
Why do we assume that our
universe is the only one that

00:31:05.112 --> 00:31:07.570
could have like-- why couldn't
just all the multi-universes

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:08.162
have like--

00:31:08.162 --> 00:31:08.870
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:09.090
Right.

00:31:09.090 --> 00:31:09.800
Well, that's OK.

00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:11.430
That is what I am talking about.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:13.540
I'm trying to answer it.

00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:16.430
So if the vacuum energy density
were significantly larger

00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:18.424
than what we observe,
the universes

00:31:18.424 --> 00:31:20.340
would fly apart so fast
that there could never

00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:24.085
be galaxies and therefore
never planets, none of things

00:31:24.085 --> 00:31:26.460
that we think of as being
associated with life as we know

00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.670
it.

00:31:27.670 --> 00:31:31.820
Conversely, if the vacuum energy
density were negative, but had

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.530
a magnitude large compared
to what we observed,

00:31:34.530 --> 00:31:37.550
that would be a large negative
acceleration, an implosion.

00:31:37.550 --> 00:31:40.050
And those universes would
just implode, collapse,

00:31:40.050 --> 00:31:44.840
in an incredibly short amount
of time, much too fast for life,

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.750
of any type that we
know of, to form.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:51.780
So there is a physical argument
which suggests that life only

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.040
forms when the vacuum
energy density is very low.

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.392
And Weinberg and his
collaborators-- and this

00:31:58.392 --> 00:32:00.892
is the same Steve Weinberg who
wrote the First Three Minutes

00:32:00.892 --> 00:32:04.860
that we're reading-- calculated
what the requirements would

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.220
be for galaxy formation.

00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:09.710
And they decided that, within
about a factor of 5 or so,

00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:11.260
the vacuum energy
density would have

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.430
to be about the same as
what we observe or less

00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:17.300
in order for galaxies to form.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:19.354
So it seems like a
possible explanation.

00:32:19.354 --> 00:32:21.520
It's certainly not a generally
accepted explanation.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.820
These things are very
controversial one.

00:32:22.820 --> 00:32:24.278
I guess that's, in
fact, what I was

00:32:24.278 --> 00:32:26.940
going to talk about
on my next slide.

00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:30.910
Some physicists by this
selection effect idea.

00:32:30.910 --> 00:32:33.720
I tend to buy it.

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.791
But a number of physicists
regard it as totally

00:32:35.791 --> 00:32:37.665
ridiculous, saying you
could explain anything

00:32:37.665 --> 00:32:40.680
if you except
arguments like that.

00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.960
And there's some truth to that.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.730
You can explain a lot
of things if you're

00:32:44.730 --> 00:32:46.800
willing to just say,
well, maybe that's needed

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:49.050
for life to happen.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.840
So because of that, I would
say that these selection effect

00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:55.530
arguments or anthropic
arguments should always

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:59.200
be viewed as the
arguments of last resort.

00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:01.659
That is, unless we
actually understand

00:33:01.659 --> 00:33:03.200
the landscape of
String theory, which

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.660
we do not in detail,
and once we actually

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:08.640
understand what it
takes to create life,

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.510
we really can't do more than
give plausibility arguments

00:33:12.510 --> 00:33:17.190
to justify these
anthropic explanations.

00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:22.620
But these anthropic
arguments do sound sensible.

00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:24.670
I think there's nothing
illogical about them,

00:33:24.670 --> 00:33:28.060
and they could very well be the
explanations for some things.

00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:31.070
As I pointed out, I think it
is the explanation for why

00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:33.270
we are living in
such an unusual place

00:33:33.270 --> 00:33:36.580
within our own visible universe.

00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:41.310
And it means that these
selection effect arguments

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.760
become very attractive when the
search for more deterministic

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.800
explanations have failed.

00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.370
And in the case of trying to
explain the very small vacuum

00:33:50.370 --> 00:33:52.770
energy density, I think
other attempts have failed.

00:33:52.770 --> 00:33:58.270
We don't have any calculational,
deterministic understanding

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:03.040
for why the vacuum energy
should be so small.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:07.900
So is it time to accept this
explanation of last resort

00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:10.090
that the vacuum energy
density is small

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:13.665
because it has to be
for life to the evolve?

00:34:13.665 --> 00:34:15.320
Your guess is as good as mine.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:17.380
I don't really know.

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.520
But I would say that, in the
case of the vacuum energy

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.929
density, people have
been trying very, very

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:24.760
hard for quite a
few years now to try

00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.610
to find a particle physics
explanation for why the vacuum

00:34:28.610 --> 00:34:32.872
energy has to be small, and
nobody's really found anything

00:34:32.872 --> 00:34:35.205
that anybody has found-- that
any large number of people

00:34:35.205 --> 00:34:37.770
have found to be acceptable.

00:34:37.770 --> 00:34:39.520
So it is certainly a
very serious problem.

00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:41.900
And I think it is
time to take seriously

00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.770
the argument of last resort,
that maybe it's that way only

00:34:45.770 --> 00:34:49.120
because in the parts of the
multiverse where it's not

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.139
that way, nobody lives there.

00:34:53.576 --> 00:34:55.409
So I would say it's
hard to deny, as of now,

00:34:55.409 --> 00:34:58.720
that the selection
effect explanation is

00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.930
the most plausible of
any explanation that

00:35:00.930 --> 00:35:04.440
is known at the present time.

00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:06.570
To summarize things--
I'm actually done now,

00:35:06.570 --> 00:35:09.410
but let me just
summarize what I said

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.856
to remind you where we're at.

00:35:12.856 --> 00:35:14.605
I've argued that the
inflationary paradigm

00:35:14.605 --> 00:35:16.790
is in great shape.

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:20.007
It explains the large
scale uniformity.

00:35:20.007 --> 00:35:21.840
It predicts the mass
density of the universe

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.180
to better than about 1% accuracy
and explains the ripples

00:35:26.180 --> 00:35:29.260
that we see in the cosmic
background radiation,

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:32.010
explaining them as a result
of quantum fluctuations

00:35:32.010 --> 00:35:36.590
that took place in the
very early universe.

00:35:36.590 --> 00:35:39.560
The picture leads
to three ideas that

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:42.610
at least point towards
the idea of a multiverse.

00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:45.560
It certainly doesn't prove that
we're living in a multiverse.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.800
But the three ideas that
point in that direction

00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:50.610
are, first of all, the
statement that almost

00:35:50.610 --> 00:35:53.230
all inflationary models
lead to this feature

00:35:53.230 --> 00:35:57.030
of eternal inflation, that
the exponential expansion

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:59.630
of the inflating material,
generally speaking,

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:02.530
out runs the decay
of that material

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:07.490
so that the volume grows
exponentially forever.

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:12.030
Second point is that, in 1998,
the astronomers discovered

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:15.290
this rather amazing fact
that the universe is not

00:36:15.290 --> 00:36:21.420
slowing down as it expands,
but in fact, is accelerating.

00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.380
And that indicates
that there has

00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:26.560
to be some peculiar material
in the universe other than what

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.510
we already knew was here,
and that peculiar material is

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:31.780
called the dark energy.

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:35.410
And we don't have any simple
interpretation of what it is,

00:36:35.410 --> 00:36:37.970
but it seems to most
likely be vacuum energy.

00:36:37.970 --> 00:36:40.800
And if it is, it
leads immediately

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:43.470
to the important
question of can we

00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:47.420
understand why it has
a value that it has.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:50.810
It seems to be much smaller
than what we would expect.

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:54.370
And then three, the
String theorists

00:36:54.370 --> 00:36:57.172
give us an interesting
way out here.

00:36:57.172 --> 00:36:59.130
The String theorists tell
us that maybe there's

00:36:59.130 --> 00:37:01.780
not unique vacuum to
the laws of physics,

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:03.410
but maybe there's a
huge number, which

00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:06.410
seems to be in fact what
String theory predicts.

00:37:06.410 --> 00:37:11.910
And if there is, then of
the many different vacua

00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.070
you expect there to be,
in fact perhaps even

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.460
a large number, that would have
this very small vacuum energy

00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:22.680
density, a tiny fraction of
the total different vacua,

00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:24.820
but nonetheless a
large number of vacua

00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:26.740
that would have this property.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.170
And then this
selection effect idea

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:30.620
can provide a
possible explanation

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:35.230
for why we are living in one of
those very unusual vacua which

00:37:35.230 --> 00:37:39.630
has this incredibly tiny
vacuum energy density.

00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:42.040
So finally, I'd
just like to close

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:45.460
with a little sociological
discussion here.

00:37:45.460 --> 00:37:48.130
Do physicists really
take this seriously?

00:37:48.130 --> 00:37:50.810
And I'd like to tell you about
a conversation that took place

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:52.670
at a conference a few years ago.

00:37:52.670 --> 00:37:56.260
Starting with Martin Rees, who I
don't know if you know the name

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.850
or not, but he's an Astronomer
Royal of Great Britain,

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:00.590
former president
of Royal Society,

00:38:00.590 --> 00:38:02.810
former master of
Trinity College as well,

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:06.082
a very distinguished person,
nice guy, too, by the way.

00:38:06.082 --> 00:38:07.540
And he said that
he is sufficiently

00:38:07.540 --> 00:38:12.340
confident in the multiverse
to bet his dog's life on it.

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:16.490
Andrei Linde, from Stanford,
a real enthusiastic person

00:38:16.490 --> 00:38:21.410
about the multiverse, one of the
founders of inflation as well,

00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:23.227
said that he's so
confident that he

00:38:23.227 --> 00:38:25.801
would bet his own life on it.

00:38:25.801 --> 00:38:27.550
Steve Weinberg was not
at this conference,

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:29.758
but he wrote an article
commenting on this discussion

00:38:29.758 --> 00:38:31.467
later which became known.

00:38:31.467 --> 00:38:33.050
And I always considered
Steve Weinberg

00:38:33.050 --> 00:38:34.827
the voice of reason,
which is why we're

00:38:34.827 --> 00:38:36.160
reading the First Three Minutes.

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.076
And he said that I have
just enough confidence

00:38:38.076 --> 00:38:40.130
in the multiverse to
bet-- guess what's

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:43.556
coming-- the lives of both
Andrei Linde and Martin Rees'

00:38:43.556 --> 00:38:44.055
dog.

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:52.870
That's it for the
summary, or the overview.

00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:56.000
Anymore overview type
questions before we get back

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.140
to the beginning, actual
beginning of the class?

00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:07.066
Yes?

00:39:07.066 --> 00:39:13.345
AUDIENCE: You said-- so
selection effect argument says

00:39:13.345 --> 00:39:19.668
that it's because life
exists within these certain

00:39:19.668 --> 00:39:24.150
constraints, omega being one
and low energy larger than it

00:39:24.150 --> 00:39:29.130
generally is allowed, that
life could exist in this way.

00:39:29.130 --> 00:39:32.118
But we're considering
carbon-based life.

00:39:32.118 --> 00:39:36.351
What if there's some
other [INAUDIBLE] life

00:39:36.351 --> 00:39:39.588
forms out there that gives
us different energies

00:39:39.588 --> 00:39:41.997
and radiation and
stuff like that?

00:39:41.997 --> 00:39:43.830
PROFESSOR: Yeah, what
you're pointing toward

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:47.720
is certainly a severe weakness
of these selection effect

00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.760
arguments, that we really know
about carbon-based life, life

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.600
that's like us, and we can
talk about what conditions

00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:58.090
are needed to make life
like us, but maybe there's

00:39:58.090 --> 00:39:59.860
life that's totally
different from us

00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:01.490
that we don't know
anything about that

00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:02.970
might be able to
live under totally

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:04.485
different circumstances.

00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:10.590
That is a real weakness.

00:40:10.590 --> 00:40:14.240
However, I would argue-- and
this is also controversial.

00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.110
Not everybody would agree
with what I'm about to say.

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:21.830
But I would argue that if
we're willing to explain

00:40:21.830 --> 00:40:25.990
the unusual features of
the piece of the universe

00:40:25.990 --> 00:40:29.350
that we live in by
selection effect arguments--

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.140
the fact I used, the
example is simply

00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:34.580
that we're living a place
where the mass density is

00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.060
10 to the 30 times
larger than the mean.

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.790
If we're willing to use the
anthropic arguments to explain

00:40:39.790 --> 00:40:43.930
that, then I think all those
same issues arise there also.

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:46.210
If life was really teem--
if the universe was really

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.040
teeming with a different
kind of life that

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:51.290
thrived in vacua,
then we'd be much more

00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:54.020
likely to be one of them,
extremely unusual creatures

00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.690
living on the
surfaces of planets.

00:40:56.690 --> 00:41:00.010
So I think it's a
possible weakness

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:01.874
that one has to
keep in mind, but I

00:41:01.874 --> 00:41:03.540
don't think it should
stop us from using

00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:04.720
those arguments completely.

00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:07.940
But it is certainly a
cause for skepticism.

00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:08.440
Yes?

00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:10.606
AUDIENCE: Isn't the point
of the selection principle

00:41:10.606 --> 00:41:16.376
just the fact that exist--
the universe selected for us.

00:41:16.376 --> 00:41:19.352
Does it matter for the general
of just for like carbon-based

00:41:19.352 --> 00:41:21.832
[? organisms? ?] Is the fact
that we exist [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:21.832 --> 00:41:24.312
that we've been selected
for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:28.310 --> 00:41:29.710
PROFESSOR: You're
asking about, I

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.750
think, how peculiar
to carbon-based life

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:35.353
should we expect these selection
effect arguments to be.

00:41:35.353 --> 00:41:37.728
AUDIENCE: Doesn't the selection
affect where [INAUDIBLE]?

00:41:46.262 --> 00:41:47.970
PROFESSOR: Now that's
an important point,

00:41:47.970 --> 00:41:51.550
and certainly one that's not
settled among philosophers,

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.170
probabilist,
physicists, or anybody.

00:41:54.170 --> 00:41:56.680
What you're asking-- if
I'm summarizing it right--

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.300
is when we're thinking
of the selection effects,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.554
should we may be only talk
about carbon-based life

00:42:01.554 --> 00:42:03.970
because, after all, we know
that we are carbon-based life.

00:42:03.970 --> 00:42:06.178
So what does it matter if
there's other kinds of life

00:42:06.178 --> 00:42:07.180
out there?

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:09.390
That's one way of
looking at it, certainly.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:12.420
Or, maybe we should think
about all kinds of life.

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.550
That's something
else that people say.

00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.085
The problem I would--
I tend to be by the way

00:42:21.085 --> 00:42:23.460
the kind of person that thinks
that all life is relevant,

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:25.210
not just carbon-based life.

00:42:25.210 --> 00:42:26.876
Because we happen
to be carbon-based,

00:42:26.876 --> 00:42:28.250
and we happen to
have fingernails

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:29.330
that have a certain
length, and we

00:42:29.330 --> 00:42:31.230
happen to have hair
that's a certain length

00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:32.990
or a certain
thickness, does that

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:34.930
mean we should only
think of those things

00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:36.471
as being relevant
when we're thinking

00:42:36.471 --> 00:42:38.066
about selection effects?

00:42:38.066 --> 00:42:39.440
And I would say
that they're not.

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.100
If our hair had a
different thicknesses,

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.870
we would still be able to
make measurements and so on.

00:42:46.870 --> 00:42:49.890
So from my point
of view, when one

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:53.680
thinks about these issues
of selection effects,

00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.350
one should precondition
only on the elements that

00:42:57.350 --> 00:43:00.000
are necessary to ask the
question in the first place.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.200
And what I would like to
think-- and as I point out,

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.920
this is controversial,
not everybody

00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.060
agrees with me-- is that
a good theory should

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.550
be a theory in which you could
say that most of the people who

00:43:11.550 --> 00:43:14.440
ask this particular question
will get the answer that we

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.420
say.

00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.380
If only a tiny fraction of
people who ask that question

00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:20.525
will get that answer, but
that same tiny fraction

00:43:20.525 --> 00:43:22.150
happens to have hair
of a certain color

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.767
and you have hair
of that color, to me

00:43:23.767 --> 00:43:26.350
that's still not an explanation
because you don't know why you

00:43:26.350 --> 00:43:27.891
have hair of that
color or why you're

00:43:27.891 --> 00:43:30.700
living in such an unusual place.

00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.190
OK that strikes up a
lot of conversations.

00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:33.690
Yes?

00:43:33.690 --> 00:43:35.065
AUDIENCE: You
mentioned last time

00:43:35.065 --> 00:43:36.540
that the different
pocket universes

00:43:36.540 --> 00:43:39.460
that comprise the multiverse
are disconnected from each other

00:43:39.460 --> 00:43:44.460
though they start out as patches
within the preceding vacua.

00:43:44.460 --> 00:43:46.630
What starts to disconnect
them fundamentally

00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:50.850
from the vacuum
which they formed?

00:43:50.850 --> 00:43:53.540
PROFESSOR: The question is
what is it that separates these

00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.410
different pocket universe's.

00:43:55.410 --> 00:43:57.200
If they start out all
in the same space,

00:43:57.200 --> 00:43:59.520
don't they remain all
in the same space?

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:02.250
And the answer is they do, but
the space they started out in

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:04.660
was expanding at
a very rapid rate.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:08.130
So in most cases,
but not all actually,

00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.480
two pocket universes will
form far enough apart

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.040
from each other
that they will never

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.460
touch each other as they grow
because the space in between

00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:17.820
will expand to fast to
ever allow them to meet.

00:44:17.820 --> 00:44:21.010
However, collisions
of pocket universities

00:44:21.010 --> 00:44:24.710
will occur if two pocket
universes form close enough

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:27.240
to each other, the expansion
of space in between

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.620
will not be enough to keep them
apart, and they will glide.

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:33.940
How frequent one should
think of that as being

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:36.380
is an incredibly tough
question to which

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.440
nobody knows the answer.

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:40.680
There are actually--
at least there

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:42.650
is at least one
astronomical paper

00:44:42.650 --> 00:44:44.610
in the literature by
a group of astronomers

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:49.160
who have looked for possible
signs of a collision of bubbles

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:50.410
in our past.

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:53.380
They did not find
anything definitive.

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.860
But it is something
to think about,

00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.882
and it's something people
are thinking about.

00:44:57.882 --> 00:44:59.340
There really are
quite a few papers

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:03.760
about collisions of
bubbles in the literature.

00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.260
Yes?

00:45:04.260 --> 00:45:06.260
AUDIENCE: How long
is long-lived?

00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.760
So if the energy density was
too large and too negative

00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.092
would that still
be long-lived if it

00:45:13.092 --> 00:45:15.777
were to collide upon itself?

00:45:15.777 --> 00:45:18.110
PROFESSOR: Talking about the
lifetime of these universes

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:20.250
that I said would
collapse very quickly.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:21.630
How quickly do I mean?

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:25.429
AUDIENCE: Like the
metastable long-lived.

00:45:25.429 --> 00:45:26.970
PROFESSOR: I used
the word long-lived

00:45:26.970 --> 00:45:29.095
at least twice in what I've
talked about-- I talked

00:45:29.095 --> 00:45:31.280
about the long-lived
metastable vacua.

00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:33.600
And there, by long-lived
I mean anything

00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:37.250
that's long compared to the age
of our universe since the Big

00:45:37.250 --> 00:45:38.080
Bang.

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.170
Long means long
compared to 10 to the 10

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:42.980
years in that context.

00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:47.640
I also said that if the
vacuum energy of a universe

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.220
were large and negative, it
would very rapidly collapse.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:54.890
That could be as fast as
10 to the minus 20 seconds.

00:45:54.890 --> 00:45:57.110
It could be very fast
depending on how large

00:45:57.110 --> 00:45:59.860
the cosmological constant was.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:00.705
Yes?

00:46:00.705 --> 00:46:04.330
AUDIENCE: So I have read
that there's an effect such

00:46:04.330 --> 00:46:07.180
that if you're vacuum
can be seen differently

00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:08.180
by different observers.

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:10.090
For example, inertial--
there's something

00:46:10.090 --> 00:46:13.710
that I read in effect it says
that if one inertial observer

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:15.860
sees vacuum, another
observer that's

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.930
accelerating with
respect to that observer

00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:21.140
would see like a number
of particles [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:22.140
a warm gas.

00:46:22.140 --> 00:46:25.800
So how much of the effect we
observe are due to the fact

00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:28.490
that perhaps we believe the
universe is accelerating,

00:46:28.490 --> 00:46:31.580
and we're accelerating perhaps
with respect to some vacuum

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:32.830
and we're just observing that.

00:46:32.830 --> 00:46:36.115
That's just a fact of our
motion not necessarily the--

00:46:36.115 --> 00:46:37.740
PROFESSOR: You're
touching on something

00:46:37.740 --> 00:46:40.920
that is in fact very confusing.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.390
What is your name?

00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:45.110
AUDIENCE: Hani.

00:46:45.110 --> 00:46:46.060
PROFESSOR: Hani?

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:48.920
What Hani said was
that he had heard--

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.810
and this is correct--
that if one had simply

00:46:52.810 --> 00:46:55.602
a region of ordinary
vacuum-- and I am now

00:46:55.602 --> 00:46:57.560
going to talk about
special [INAUDIBLE] vacuum.

00:46:57.560 --> 00:46:59.650
You don't even need relativity.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:01.810
You don't general relativity,
you just need this.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:03.870
If you had an accelerating
observer moving

00:47:03.870 --> 00:47:06.250
through that vacuum, the
accelerating observer

00:47:06.250 --> 00:47:08.380
would not see something
that looked like vacuum,

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.630
but rather would see particles
that in fact would look

00:47:10.630 --> 00:47:12.629
like they had a finite
temperature which you can

00:47:12.629 --> 00:47:16.200
calculate, a temperature that's
determined by the acceleration.

00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.750
So the question is,
how much of what

00:47:17.750 --> 00:47:20.590
we see should we think
of as really being there

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:24.780
and how much might be caused
just by our own motion.

00:47:24.780 --> 00:47:29.175
And there's not a terribly
great answer to that question

00:47:29.175 --> 00:47:34.600
that I know of except that we--
when these questions come up,

00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.190
we tend to just
adopt the philosophy

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:41.060
that an observer
who's freely moving,

00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:44.290
which really means moving
with the gravitational field,

00:47:44.290 --> 00:47:49.280
a geodesic observer as the
word phrase is sometimes used,

00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.362
essentially defines what
you might call reality

00:47:51.362 --> 00:47:53.820
and then if you calculate what
accelerating observers might

00:47:53.820 --> 00:47:57.160
see in terms of that reality.

00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:00.620
And we are almost
geodesic observers.

00:48:00.620 --> 00:48:02.620
The Earth is exerting a
force on our feet, which

00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:05.115
violates that a little bit,
but by the overall cosmic scale

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:06.531
of things where
the speed of light

00:48:06.531 --> 00:48:08.960
is what determines
what's significant,

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:14.590
we are essentially inertial
or geodesic observers.

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:17.230
Yes, Aviv?

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:18.900
Aviv first and then
the one in front.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.358
AUDIENCE: So I'm wondering
about the philosophical approach

00:48:21.358 --> 00:48:26.232
to this discussion and why
the very-- by the definition,

00:48:26.232 --> 00:48:28.420
we can't possibly
observe another universe.

00:48:28.420 --> 00:48:31.125
And so maybe we
have a theory that

00:48:31.125 --> 00:48:33.125
makes a lot of great
predictions like inflation.

00:48:33.125 --> 00:48:36.618
But it may also make
predictions about multiverse.

00:48:36.618 --> 00:48:39.778
We can't possibly empirically
determine whether that's true

00:48:39.778 --> 00:48:41.770
or not, so a
nonfalsifiable question.

00:48:41.770 --> 00:48:46.740
And so I feel like
[INAUDIBLE] who [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:49.728
essentially never
going to be answered.

00:48:49.728 --> 00:48:52.192
And if we're going to
be strict empiricists,

00:48:52.192 --> 00:48:55.720
should we not be concerned
with this question?

00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:58.350
PROFESSOR: The question is if we
could never see another pocket

00:48:58.350 --> 00:49:01.210
universe, is it even
a valid question

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.825
to discuss whether
or not they exist,

00:49:03.825 --> 00:49:06.770
a valid scientific question.

00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:09.210
That is also a question
which is generally

00:49:09.210 --> 00:49:13.420
debated in the community, and
people have taken both sides.

00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:14.970
There certainly is
a point of view,

00:49:14.970 --> 00:49:18.110
which I think I
tend to take, which

00:49:18.110 --> 00:49:21.150
is that we never really
insist that every aspect

00:49:21.150 --> 00:49:23.540
of our theories can be tested.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:27.560
If you think about any theory,
even Newtonian gravity,

00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:30.105
you can certainly
imagine implications

00:49:30.105 --> 00:49:31.480
of Newtonian
gravity that you can

00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.440
calculate that
nobody's ever measured.

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:38.686
So I think in practice we
tend to accept theories

00:49:38.686 --> 00:49:41.060
when they have made enough
measurements that we've tested

00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.910
so that the theory
becomes persuasive.

00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:47.970
And when that happens, I think
we should, at the same time,

00:49:47.970 --> 00:49:50.420
take seriously whatever
those words mean,

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:54.670
the implications that the theory
has for things that cannot be

00:49:54.670 --> 00:49:56.270
directly tested.

00:49:56.270 --> 00:49:58.010
As far as the other
pocket universes,

00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.385
some people think
it's important,

00:49:59.385 --> 00:50:03.280
and maybe I do too,
that even though it's

00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.880
highly unlikely, incredibly
unlikely, unbelievably unlikely

00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:09.800
that we'll ever acquire
direct observational evidence

00:50:09.800 --> 00:50:12.830
for another pocket universe,
it's not really in principle

00:50:12.830 --> 00:50:16.180
impossible because of the fact
that pocket universes can,

00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:18.210
in principle, collide.

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.020
So we could, in principle,
describe with evidence

00:50:21.020 --> 00:50:23.865
that our universe has had
contact with another pocket

00:50:23.865 --> 00:50:24.740
universe in the past.

00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:28.170
Yes.

00:50:28.170 --> 00:50:29.840
AUDIENCE: What
determines the stability

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:33.190
of a particular vacuum state?

00:50:33.190 --> 00:50:36.785
Is it simply things with higher
vacuum energies are less stable

00:50:36.785 --> 00:50:39.035
and things with lower vacuum
energies are more stable?

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.750
PROFESSOR: The question
is what determines

00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:47.260
the stability of
the different vacua.

00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:48.940
Is it simply that
higher energy ones

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:51.990
are more unstable and lower
energy ones are more stable

00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:54.630
or is it more
complicated than that?

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:56.140
And the answer,
as far as I know,

00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:59.450
is that there is a trend
for higher energy ones

00:50:59.450 --> 00:51:02.639
to be more unstable and lower
energy ones to be more stable.

00:51:02.639 --> 00:51:03.930
But it's not as simple as that.

00:51:03.930 --> 00:51:06.450
There are also wide
variations that

00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:08.390
are independent of
the energy density.

00:51:08.390 --> 00:51:10.410
AUDIENCE: If the one
that we're living in

00:51:10.410 --> 00:51:14.800
is incredibly is really
ridiculously close to zero

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:19.400
in a city that seems to make
it incredibly unlikely that we

00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:25.910
would pay anything else I soon

00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:27.570
PROFESSOR: Right.

00:51:27.570 --> 00:51:29.330
The question is if
our universe has

00:51:29.330 --> 00:51:31.310
such has such a
small energy density

00:51:31.310 --> 00:51:33.460
relative to the average.

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:35.980
Wouldn't that mean
that we should also

00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:39.040
expect to be much more
long-lived than average?

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:41.140
And the answer is I guess so.

00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:43.920
But as far as the effect
on the Swiss cheese

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:46.579
picture that I described
for the ultimate future,

00:51:46.579 --> 00:51:48.245
it doesn't change the
words that I used.

00:51:48.245 --> 00:51:52.320
It just changes how frequent
those decays would be.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:55.470
But since the future of
this pocket universe,

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:58.280
if this picture is
right, will be infinite,

00:51:58.280 --> 00:52:02.280
decays will happen no matter
how small the probability is.

00:52:02.280 --> 00:52:05.550
An infinite number of
decays will happen in fact.

00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:07.050
OK we should probably
go on now even

00:52:07.050 --> 00:52:08.380
if there are more questions.

00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:12.960
We have a whole term to
discuss things like this.

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.120
The next thing I
want to do is handle

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.170
some housekeeping details.

00:52:17.170 --> 00:52:19.700
I'd like to arrange
office hours.

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:23.220
And the problem sets
are due on Friday,

00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:25.730
so what [? Tsingtao ?]
and I thought

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:28.220
was that a good time
for office hours

00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.740
would be on Wednesdays
and Thursdays.

00:52:30.740 --> 00:52:33.480
One of us on each of those days.

00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:35.470
It turns out that I can't
really do Thursdays,

00:52:35.470 --> 00:52:37.870
so one of us on
each of those days

00:52:37.870 --> 00:52:39.430
ends up meaning
that I'll probably

00:52:39.430 --> 00:52:41.290
be having office
hours on Wednesdays.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:42.790
This is all
provisional depending

00:52:42.790 --> 00:52:45.202
on how it works with you folks.

00:52:45.202 --> 00:52:46.660
And [? Tsingtao ?]
will probably be

00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:49.660
having office
hours on Thursdays.

00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:51.784
Generally speaking, if one
wants to have an office

00:52:51.784 --> 00:52:53.200
hour that most
people can come to,

00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.520
I think it should be
in the late afternoon.

00:52:56.520 --> 00:52:59.350
So maybe we'll start by
discussing my office hours

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:01.500
since it comes before
[? Tsingtao's, ?] Wednesday

00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.300
versus Thursday.

00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:07.450
So on Wednesday, I
can do an office hour

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:13.220
in the late, normal afternoon,
which might mean 4:00 to 5:00

00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.590
I think after five some
people have sports activities

00:53:16.590 --> 00:53:17.090
and things.

00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:20.224
We're told to try to
avoid those hours.

00:53:20.224 --> 00:53:22.265
So 4:00 to 5:00 would be
a reasonable possibility

00:53:22.265 --> 00:53:24.610
for my office hour on Wednesday.

00:53:24.610 --> 00:53:26.464
If that doesn't
work, I could stay

00:53:26.464 --> 00:53:28.130
and have the office
hour in the evening.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:30.290
That's actually what
I did two years ago.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:33.140
I had an office hour
from 7:30 to 8:30.

00:53:33.140 --> 00:53:35.030
It was also
Wednesdays-- I forget.

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:38.130
But it was in the evening,
and that's a possibility.

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:44.200
So let me ask if I have my
office hour from 4:00 to 5:00

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:47.490
on Wednesdays, how
many of you who

00:53:47.490 --> 00:53:50.090
might be interested in coming
would not be able to come?

00:53:53.150 --> 00:53:57.500
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:02.970
A significant number, but
most of you can come at least.

00:54:02.970 --> 00:54:06.760
Let me ask the corresponding
question for the evening.

00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:10.490
Suppose I made the office
hour from 7:30 to 8:30

00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:12.690
in the evening on Wednesdays.

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:17.120
In that case, how many of
you who might want to come

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:18.230
would not be able to come?

00:54:21.158 --> 00:54:28.170
1, 2, 3 5, 6, so it's a smaller
number, but not vastly smaller.

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:35.760
OK I think I'll do it in
the evening for the benefit

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.780
of the difference
between those two groups.

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:40.480
And the evening also has
the little slight advantage

00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:43.220
that it can be a little more
open-ended if people still

00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:46.270
have questions after
the normal time is over.

00:54:46.270 --> 00:54:56.270
So I will make my office hour on
Wednesday's from 7:30 to 8:30.

00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:58.990
Is that particular hour as good
an hour as any on Wednesday

00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.554
evening.

00:54:59.554 --> 00:55:01.470
Would people want to
move it earlier or later?

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:08.651
Any suggestions for moving
it earlier or later?

00:55:08.651 --> 00:55:11.151
AUDIENCE: I know people have
sports til technically at least

00:55:11.151 --> 00:55:17.354
7:00, but if it's 6:30 to
7:30 might be a little--

00:55:17.354 --> 00:55:18.020
PROFESSOR: 6:30?

00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:21.400
You'll be starting at 6--
starting at 6:30 versus-- 6:30

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.480
to 7:30, starting at 6:30.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.884
Well, I'd be happy
to do that, but I

00:55:26.884 --> 00:55:28.800
suspect we might run
into problems with people

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:30.940
who have sport
activities, but let's see.

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:34.290
How many of you would
be inconvenienced

00:55:34.290 --> 00:55:36.277
if I started at 6:30
instead of 7:30?

00:55:39.079 --> 00:55:42.780
3, 4, 5, 6, a number.

00:55:42.780 --> 00:55:47.440
So I think we'll honor
that and start at 7:30.

00:55:47.440 --> 00:55:49.910
I assume 7 is also a bit of
a problem for those people.

00:55:55.225 --> 00:55:55.850
We'll say 7:30.

00:56:22.287 --> 00:56:24.245
Now, I have to announce
that this week is going

00:56:24.245 --> 00:56:26.661
to unfortunately have to be
an exception because I already

00:56:26.661 --> 00:56:28.670
have plans for Wednesday night.

00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:32.030
So for this week, I
think the best thing--

00:56:32.030 --> 00:56:33.730
the only possible
thing, probably

00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:35.810
the best-- it's almost
the only possible thing

00:56:35.810 --> 00:56:38.700
would be 4:00 to
5:00 on Wednesday.

00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:40.040
Wednesday's bit tomorrow.

00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:42.412
I'll send you all an email
when I find a room for that.

00:56:42.412 --> 00:56:44.370
I think I'll probably
not have it in my office,

00:56:44.370 --> 00:56:46.850
but maybe it will
be in my office.

00:56:46.850 --> 00:56:47.680
Comment up there?

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.930
AUDIENCE: Oh, I was just
going to ask where, but you--

00:56:49.930 --> 00:56:51.132
PROFESSOR: Where?

00:56:51.132 --> 00:56:53.090
OK, I guess then the
fourth option's my office.

00:56:53.090 --> 00:56:54.714
I was hoping to put
a sign of my office

00:56:54.714 --> 00:56:56.950
if we're someplace
other than my office.

00:56:56.950 --> 00:57:00.260
So should put this
on the board too.

00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:07.110
Tomorrow 4:00 to 5:00 PM.

00:57:15.790 --> 00:57:17.770
So be at my office
or I'll send email.

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:28.416
Yes?

00:57:28.416 --> 00:57:32.280
AUDIENCE: How will we be turning
in the Thursday problem set?

00:57:32.280 --> 00:57:35.910
PROFESSOR: We're going
to talk about that now.

00:57:35.910 --> 00:57:38.819
For Thursday, for
[? Tsingtao, ?] I remember

00:57:38.819 --> 00:57:39.860
you had some constraints.

00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:41.026
So what was possible?

00:57:41.026 --> 00:57:41.760
TSINGTAO: Yeah.

00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:44.215
So I usually leave
around 7:00 PM,

00:57:44.215 --> 00:57:47.652
so I have appointment
[? meeting ?],

00:57:47.652 --> 00:57:52.562
and today is probably
not very good at 4:00 PM.

00:57:56.090 --> 00:57:58.800
PROFESSOR: So 4:00 to 5:00 is a
possibility for [? Tsingtao ?]

00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.290
on Thursday, and I
guess later than that.

00:58:02.290 --> 00:58:04.422
But should be over by
5:00-- by 7:00 either

00:58:04.422 --> 00:58:06.130
or do you want it to
be over before then.

00:58:06.130 --> 00:58:08.380
TSINGTAO: Oh, 6:00 to 7:002
Oh, 6:00 to 7:002 I guess.

00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.412
PROFESSOR: 6:00 to
7:00 would be OK?

00:58:10.412 --> 00:58:11.495
TSINGTAO: Yeah, that's OK.

00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:20.587
PROFESSOR: OK, so let's
start with 4:00 to 5:00.

00:58:20.587 --> 00:58:23.170
If [? Tsingtao ?] was to have
an office hour from 4:00 to 5:00

00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:26.990
on Thursdays, how many of you
think you might want to go

00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:29.640
would be unable to?

00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:31.100
Wow, tons!

00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.750
OK, that seems more than
half of you I think.

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.400
So I guess we try to avoid that.

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:40.235
This impact's probably
an athletic region,

00:58:40.235 --> 00:58:44.250
but maybe we'll have to do that
for lack of an alternative.

00:58:44.250 --> 00:58:46.240
Suppose it were 5:00 to 6:00.

00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:48.907
How many of you who would be
interesting in coming-- who

00:58:48.907 --> 00:58:50.740
might be interesting
in coming, I should say

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.180
I guess because it'll
vary from week to week--

00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:53.190
but how many of you
who think you might

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:54.780
be interested in
coming would not

00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:58.620
be able to come from 5:00
to 6:00 on Thursdays.

00:58:58.620 --> 00:58:59.660
OK, a small group.

00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:03.872
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:59:03.872 --> 00:59:06.810
Looks to me like 7.

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:10.090
And let's say, I
said 4:00-- That

00:59:10.090 --> 00:59:13.850
was at 6:00-- that
was 5:00 to 6:00.

00:59:13.850 --> 00:59:17.170
So maybe we should next try 5:30
to 6:30 in smaller increments

00:59:17.170 --> 00:59:17.850
here.

00:59:17.850 --> 00:59:20.100
If we're 5:30 to
6:30, how many of you

00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:21.210
would not be able to come?

00:59:24.745 --> 00:59:27.800
Looks like pretty
much the same people.

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:30.330
And if it were 6:00 to
7:00, how many of you

00:59:30.330 --> 00:59:33.050
would not be able to come?

00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:36.810
Same people, I think it is
literally the same people.

00:59:36.810 --> 00:59:37.680
OK.

00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.450
So it looks like 4:00
to 5:00 is very bad.

00:59:40.450 --> 00:59:44.200
And all other times
are about equivalent.

00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.695
So I think if all other
times are bad equivalently,

00:59:46.695 --> 00:59:50.930
we probably might as well
make it 5:00 to 6:00.

00:59:50.930 --> 00:59:53.313
And that way
[? Tsingtao ?] can get off

00:59:53.313 --> 00:59:57.670
to an earliest possible start
to wherever he's going at 7:00,

00:59:57.670 --> 01:00:00.620
and it also means a little
more flexibility in the end

01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:02.005
if there are more questions.

01:00:34.969 --> 01:00:36.752
AUDIENCE: Where is that located?

01:00:36.752 --> 01:00:38.210
PROFESSOR: That
also, I think, will

01:00:38.210 --> 01:00:40.685
require us to get a room
which will be announced.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.980
So I will try to
arrange rooms tomorrow

01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:59.390
morning and send
it by email, and I

01:00:59.390 --> 01:01:01.140
guess I'll post it on
the website as well.

01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:07.900
Any other organizational--
and questions

01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:10.080
limited to organizational
questions now?

01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.130
Get back to physics later.

01:01:12.130 --> 01:01:13.880
Any organizational
questions before we

01:01:13.880 --> 01:01:16.340
start on Doppler shifts?

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:17.612
Yes?

01:01:17.612 --> 01:01:20.067
AUDIENCE: If I can't make
a single office hour,

01:01:20.067 --> 01:01:23.020
how should I field questions
when I have questions?

01:01:23.020 --> 01:01:25.409
PROFESSOR: A good question.

01:01:25.409 --> 01:01:27.700
Yeah, there may be some
people, and apparently there is

01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.825
at least one who cannot
make either of these times,

01:01:29.825 --> 01:01:31.700
even though we tried
to optimize things.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:34.582
So by all means,
don't feel like you

01:01:34.582 --> 01:01:36.040
don't have a channel
for questions.

01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:37.715
If you have a question,
send an email to

01:01:37.715 --> 01:01:39.250
either me, or
[? Tsingtao, ?] or both.

01:01:39.250 --> 01:01:40.930
And we'll either answer
it together with you

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:43.360
or answer you by email depending
on what the question is

01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:46.484
and what seems useful.

01:01:46.484 --> 01:01:47.650
And that goes for everybody.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:57.600
In that case, if
everybody's on board,

01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:02.060
we will now start the actual
material for the term.

01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.599
Well, the overview
is an overview

01:02:03.599 --> 01:02:06.015
of the material for the term,
but not at the standard pace

01:02:06.015 --> 01:02:08.880
and the standard
level of detail.

01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:11.200
So what I want to
talk about this week--

01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:13.430
and I guess I'll only get
to start today and finish

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:15.106
on Thursday-- I had
planned to tell you

01:02:15.106 --> 01:02:17.480
everything you need to know
for the problem set by today,

01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.160
but that's not going to happen.

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:24.240
So I don't-- if people complain,
we could consider postponing

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.321
the due date of the problem
set, so consider that an option.

01:02:28.321 --> 01:02:30.320
But probably you could
do the problem set anyway

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.970
because it is all
described in lecture notes.

01:02:32.970 --> 01:02:35.670
But if any of you have
difficulties meeting

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.360
that deadline, it will be a
somewhat flexible deadline

01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:40.110
this week because of
the fact that I'm not

01:02:40.110 --> 01:02:43.270
covering the material
today as I had planned.

01:02:43.270 --> 01:02:47.080
And I'll admit that's not
necessarily a good thing

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:50.680
to do in terms of problem set.

01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:54.420
So we're going to begin
the course, in principle,

01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:58.490
by talking about Hubble's law,
although Hubble's law will

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:01.050
rapidly lead us to the
question of the Doppler shift,

01:03:01.050 --> 01:03:03.150
which is what I'll
mainly be talking

01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:07.650
about for the rest of today
and for most of Thursday.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:17.920
Hubble's law itself
is a simple equation

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:24.810
that v is equal to h r,
where v is the recession

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:33.365
velocity of any typical galaxy.

01:03:38.126 --> 01:03:39.500
Hubble's law is
not an exact law,

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:42.754
so individual galaxies will
deviate from Hubble's law.

01:03:42.754 --> 01:03:44.420
But in principle,
Hubble's law tells you

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:48.000
what the recession velocity
is of a galaxy, at least

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.160
to reasonable accuracy.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:04:00.880
Where h is what is often
called Hubble's constant.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:04.290
Sometimes, it is called
the Hubble parameter.

01:04:04.290 --> 01:04:08.410
I like actually-- it's called
the Hubble expansion rate.

01:04:08.410 --> 01:04:10.720
The problem with calling
Hubble's constant

01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:12.310
is that it's not
really a constant

01:04:12.310 --> 01:04:13.970
over the lifetime
of the universe.

01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:17.202
It's a constant over the
lifetime of an astronomer,

01:04:17.202 --> 01:04:19.410
but not a constant over the
lifetime of the universe?

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:21.720
And we'll be talking about
universes, not astronomers,

01:04:21.720 --> 01:04:23.550
at least for the most part.

01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:26.302
And even over history,
it's not a constant

01:04:26.302 --> 01:04:28.010
because the estimate
of Hubble's constant

01:04:28.010 --> 01:04:31.160
has actually changed by a
factor of about 10 or so

01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.730
since Hubble's
original estimate.

01:04:33.730 --> 01:04:37.500
And the r that appears here
is the distance to the galaxy.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.250
And if you look at the lecture
notes from two years ago,

01:04:51.250 --> 01:04:53.230
they start out by saying
that Hubble's law was

01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:56.150
discovered by Hubble in 1929.

01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:59.430
When I looked at that
first sentence in my notes,

01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:01.430
and when I started to
revise them for this year,

01:05:01.430 --> 01:05:03.980
I realized that I heard
that that statement has

01:05:03.980 --> 01:05:05.525
become controversial.

01:05:05.525 --> 01:05:07.525
Almost everything in
cosmology is controversial,

01:05:07.525 --> 01:05:09.720
so even that statement
is controversial.

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.650
There are claims
that Lemaitre really

01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:15.280
deserves credit for Hubble's
law rather than Hubble.

01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.412
And there's some
validity to that claim.

01:05:17.412 --> 01:05:19.370
There's also some
[? intrigued ?] that happens,

01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:21.320
if you want to read about this.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:23.794
It was discovered by
several of-- I think

01:05:23.794 --> 01:05:26.210
amateur historians I think is
what they are often referred

01:05:26.210 --> 01:05:32.277
to in the press-- that we know
mainly of Lemaitre's work-- we

01:05:32.277 --> 01:05:34.610
being the Western speaking,
the Western English speaking

01:05:34.610 --> 01:05:37.490
world-- know mainly
of a Lemaitre's work

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:41.830
through a 1931 translation
in a 1927 paper

01:05:41.830 --> 01:05:45.270
he wrote about the
foundations of cosmology.

01:05:45.270 --> 01:05:50.140
And it turned out that several
significant seeming paragraphs

01:05:50.140 --> 01:05:52.950
in the 1927 French
article somehow

01:05:52.950 --> 01:05:57.090
didn't make it to the 1931
English translation, paragraphs

01:05:57.090 --> 01:06:00.970
about the Hubble constant.

01:06:00.970 --> 01:06:03.739
And for a while, that
seemed like dirty play

01:06:03.739 --> 01:06:06.280
and there were accusations that
Hubble, or friends of Hubble,

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.260
had suppressed those
paragraphs when

01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:11.700
the article was translated.

01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:15.330
The truth finally was
discovered a couple years ago

01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:19.710
by a physicist named Mario Livio
who actually was on the Daily

01:06:19.710 --> 01:06:21.210
Show a couple nights
ago by the way.

01:06:21.210 --> 01:06:25.540
He has a book out now, not about
this, but about other things.

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.990
But anyway, he
discovered by going

01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:34.470
through the archives of the
monthly notices of astronomy,

01:06:34.470 --> 01:06:36.660
which is where the article
was published in English.

01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.243
And turned out it
was Lemaitre himself

01:06:38.243 --> 01:06:40.590
he removed those paragraphs.

01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:42.880
The paragraphs basically
gave a numerical estimate

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:47.250
of the Hubble constant, but by
1931 Hubble's papered already

01:06:47.250 --> 01:06:50.110
been published, so Lemaitre
felt that it was only

01:06:50.110 --> 01:06:52.900
a less accurate estimate
of the same quantity

01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:58.240
that Hubble had estimated, so he
cut it out of his translation.

01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.500
What certainly is
true is that Lemaitre

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:02.880
knew about Hubble's law
on theoretical grounds.

01:07:02.880 --> 01:07:06.465
Lemaitre was building a model
of an expanding universe.

01:07:06.465 --> 01:07:08.340
I don't know if he is
really the first person

01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:11.330
to know that an expanding
universe model gave rise

01:07:11.330 --> 01:07:15.870
to a linear relationship
between velocity and distance,

01:07:15.870 --> 01:07:20.930
but he certainly did know about
it and understood Hubble's law

01:07:20.930 --> 01:07:24.350
and give an estimate
of it based on data.

01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:26.440
What he did not
do, however, is try

01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:28.150
to use data to actually
show that there

01:07:28.150 --> 01:07:29.850
was a linear relationship.

01:07:29.850 --> 01:07:32.670
What Lemaitre did,
in those paragraphs

01:07:32.670 --> 01:07:35.010
that were not
translated, was simply

01:07:35.010 --> 01:07:38.690
to look at a large
group of galaxies,

01:07:38.690 --> 01:07:41.840
figure an average value for
v and an average value of r

01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.704
and determine h from
dividing those two averages.

01:07:44.704 --> 01:07:46.120
And he admitted
that there was not

01:07:46.120 --> 01:07:48.450
really good enough data to tell
if the relationship is linear

01:07:48.450 --> 01:07:49.050
or not.

01:07:52.430 --> 01:07:54.880
I think it is definitely
fair to say that Hubble

01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:00.380
is the person who deserves
credit for arguing first really

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.620
with a fairly weak argument,
but then got stronger over time,

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:05.510
that there really is
astronomical evidence

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:12.689
for this linear relationship
between velocity and distance.

01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:14.980
So probably it will continue
to be called Hubble's law.

01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:16.563
If you look in
Wikipedia, it tells you

01:08:16.563 --> 01:08:19.170
either one is acceptable
at the moment,

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:20.810
but Wikipedia articles
change rapidly,

01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:25.170
so we'll see what
it says next year.

01:08:25.170 --> 01:08:27.140
It's also mentioned
that we should probably

01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:30.170
root for Lemaitre since
Lemaitre, it turns out-- well,

01:08:30.170 --> 01:08:32.210
he was a Belgian priest,
it was often described,

01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:35.569
but he was also an MIT
student, had a Ph.D. for MIT,

01:08:35.569 --> 01:08:37.060
which he received in 1927.

01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:38.765
You can actually
read his thesis.

01:08:38.765 --> 01:08:40.389
When I was writing
my [INAUDIBLE] book,

01:08:40.389 --> 01:08:42.189
I remember going
to the MIT archives

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:44.939
and actually picking up
his thesis and reading it.

01:08:44.939 --> 01:08:47.355
It's not that well-written
actually, but it's interesting.

01:08:53.540 --> 01:08:55.559
Although he got
his Ph.D. from MIT,

01:08:55.559 --> 01:08:57.979
it also turns out that
he did most of his work

01:08:57.979 --> 01:09:02.859
down Mass Ave at the
Harvard College Observatory,

01:09:02.859 --> 01:09:04.340
but the Harvard
College Observatory

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.130
did not give degrees
in those days.

01:09:06.130 --> 01:09:07.550
It was just an observatory.

01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:09.540
So he wanted to get a
degree, so he signed up

01:09:09.540 --> 01:09:13.670
at MIT for the Ph.D.
Program and wrote a thesis,

01:09:13.670 --> 01:09:17.060
received a Ph.D.

01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:20.029
Onward, what I really
want to talk about

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:23.140
is, after mentioning
Hubble's law--

01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:26.220
so Hubble's law as an indication
that the universe is expanding.

01:09:26.220 --> 01:09:29.312
And we'll talk more about the
history of all this later,

01:09:29.312 --> 01:09:31.270
and it actually is very
well-described in Steve

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:33.729
Weinberg's book.

01:09:33.729 --> 01:09:36.597
But initially, Einstein
proposed a model

01:09:36.597 --> 01:09:38.680
of the universe that was
static, and it was really

01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:42.210
Hubble who convinced
Einstein that observationally

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:46.350
the universe does not appear
to be static, but does

01:09:46.350 --> 01:09:50.399
appear instead to obey
this expansion law.

01:09:50.399 --> 01:09:54.060
So that gave rise to the theory
of the expanding universe.

01:09:54.060 --> 01:09:57.040
But what I want to
talk about today

01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:03.666
is how one measures the
v that appears here.

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.290
There's also a big
discussion about how

01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:07.890
one measures r, the distance.

01:10:07.890 --> 01:10:11.460
And that is, I think, rather
well-done in Steve Weinberg's

01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:15.070
book, and I'm going to
pretty much leave it

01:10:15.070 --> 01:10:17.350
to your reading of
Steve Weinberg's book

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:22.340
to learn about how distances to
distant galaxies are estimated.

01:10:22.340 --> 01:10:24.610
Roughly-speaking,
I might just say

01:10:24.610 --> 01:10:27.600
that they are estimated
by finding objects

01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.580
in those distant galaxies
whose brightnesses you think

01:10:30.580 --> 01:10:32.520
you know, by one
means or another.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:35.110
And a complicated story
is what objects are there

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.320
in brightnesses
we think we know.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.230
But once you find an
object whose brightness

01:10:39.230 --> 01:10:42.130
you think you know, those
go by the general name

01:10:42.130 --> 01:10:45.490
of standard candles,
a standard candle

01:10:45.490 --> 01:10:48.450
being an object whose
brightness you know,

01:10:48.450 --> 01:10:50.460
then you can tell
how far the object is

01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:51.720
by how bright it appears.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.120
And that becomes a very
straightforward way

01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:57.370
of estimating distances,
and that is the only way

01:10:57.370 --> 01:11:01.569
we really have of estimating
distances of distant galaxies.

01:11:01.569 --> 01:11:04.110
So it's a much longer story than
what I just said, and you'll

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:07.000
read about it in
Weinberg's book.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.540
The velocity is measured
by the Doppler shift,

01:11:09.540 --> 01:11:11.950
and that's what lecture
notes one are mainly about,

01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:14.910
and that's what I'll be
talking about for the remaining

01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:19.120
few minutes of today's class.

01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:24.560
And what we want to do in the
course of this set of lecture

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.560
notes, this week of
class I guess it will be,

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.980
is understand how to
calculate the Doppler

01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:35.690
shift both non-relativistically
and relativistically,

01:11:35.690 --> 01:11:40.440
and we'll just work out the
primary cases of observer

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:44.690
stationary source moving, source
stationary observer moving,

01:11:44.690 --> 01:11:48.380
and all in a line, for
both the relativistic and

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:51.590
non-relativistic cases.

01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:54.960
So I think I'll launch into
the first calculation, which

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:57.790
you might even have
time to finish.

01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:59.600
I'd like to consider
a case where

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.610
the observer is stationary
and the source is moving,

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:05.357
which is normally how we
think of the distant galaxies.

01:12:05.357 --> 01:12:07.690
We work in our own reference
frame, so we're stationary,

01:12:07.690 --> 01:12:09.180
the galaxy is moving.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:11.280
How do we calculate
this redshift

01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:13.420
I should say at the
asset here, however--

01:12:13.420 --> 01:12:15.420
I don't know if I said
it in the lecture notes--

01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:18.090
that the cosmological
redshift is actually

01:12:18.090 --> 01:12:21.170
a little bit different from what
we're calculating this week.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:26.830
This week, we're calculating
the special relativity redshift.

01:12:26.830 --> 01:12:31.020
But cosmology is not controlled
by special relativity

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:34.040
because special relativity
does not describe gravity,

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:38.910
and gravity plays a
major role in cosmology.

01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:41.990
So the cosmological redshift,
we will talk about a little

01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:44.730
later in the course,
in a more precise way.

01:12:44.730 --> 01:12:48.700
But for now, we, like Hubble--
Hubble didn't know any better--

01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:52.779
are ignoring gravity, which
is OK for the nearby stars,

01:12:52.779 --> 01:12:54.820
and the further away they
are, the more important

01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:58.810
these gravitational influences
are, and ignoring gravity one

01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:03.400
could just use special
relativity or even

01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.750
Newtonian kinematics
to calculate

01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:12.020
the relationship between
v and the redshift.

01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:15.309
And that's what we'll
be talking about.

01:13:15.309 --> 01:13:17.350
So the first problem that
we want to talk about--

01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:22.220
and I guess I'll just set it up
and that's as far as we get--

01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:31.970
will be a problem where there's
a source of radiation, which

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:37.910
is moving to the right in our
diagram with a velocity, v,

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:46.115
and an observer
who is stationary.

01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.960
Now of course, all these are
frame dependent statements,

01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:53.410
but we're working
in a frame where

01:13:53.410 --> 01:13:55.540
the observer is stationary.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.420
And we're also going to assume
for the non-relativistic case,

01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:02.385
that the air-- we'll be talking
about sound waves-- but the air

01:14:02.385 --> 01:14:03.970
is stationary in this frame.

01:14:03.970 --> 01:14:06.940
So the frame of backboard is not
only the frame of the observer,

01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:09.040
but it's also the
frame of the air

01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:12.740
when we're talking about the
non-relativistic sound wave

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.890
calculation.

01:14:14.890 --> 01:14:16.920
So to define our
notation, we're going

01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:22.580
to let u be equal the
velocity of the sound wave.

01:14:26.580 --> 01:14:29.317
And that would normally be
measured relative to the air,

01:14:29.317 --> 01:14:31.150
but the air will be at
rest in this picture,

01:14:31.150 --> 01:14:33.200
so u will be the velocity
of the sound wave

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.870
relative to the diagram.

01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:39.420
v is the velocity of the
source already shown.

01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.930
And we'll be interested
in two time periods,

01:14:48.930 --> 01:14:53.720
delta t sub s where
s stands for source,

01:14:53.720 --> 01:15:07.115
which will be the period of
the wave at the source, which

01:15:07.115 --> 01:15:09.240
is the same as talking
about the period of the wave

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:12.660
as it would be
measured by the source.

01:15:12.660 --> 01:15:18.710
And delta t sub
O-- that's supposed

01:15:18.710 --> 01:15:21.700
to be a capital O, not a zero.

01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:34.605
It is the period of the wave
at the observer or as observed.

01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:44.470
And the important point, which
is maybe obvious qualitatively,

01:15:44.470 --> 01:15:48.010
is that these two times,
or time intervals,

01:15:48.010 --> 01:15:50.040
will not be equal to each other.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:54.170
And the reason, basically,
is that because the source is

01:15:54.170 --> 01:15:57.080
moving-- and I've defined
positive v the way

01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:01.170
astronomers would as moving away
from us-- because the source is

01:16:01.170 --> 01:16:04.270
moving away from us,
each successive wave that

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:07.690
goes from the source to us has
to travel a little bit further.

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:10.272
And that means that each wave
crest is slightly delayed

01:16:10.272 --> 01:16:11.730
from when it would
have gotten here

01:16:11.730 --> 01:16:13.650
if everything were stationary.

01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:15.230
And if you delay
each wave crest,

01:16:15.230 --> 01:16:18.130
it means the time
between crests is larger.

01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:20.880
And that means
that we expect here

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:25.390
that delta t sub O will be
larger than delta t sub s

01:16:25.390 --> 01:16:28.160
because of this extra distance
that each wave crest has

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:29.310
to travel.

01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:31.120
And what we'll be
doing next time--

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:32.870
I think I will just
leave the calculations

01:16:32.870 --> 01:16:34.820
for next time-- is
calculating that.

01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:36.820
And then doing the same
thing for the case where

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.903
the observers moving and
the source is stationary,

01:16:38.903 --> 01:16:41.200
and then talking a little
bit about special relativity,

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:43.050
and then repeating
both calculations

01:16:43.050 --> 01:16:44.980
with a special relativity
situation where

01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:48.150
we'll be talking about light
rays and velocities that

01:16:48.150 --> 01:16:50.380
might be comparable
to the speed of light.

01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:53.189
So see you folks on
Thursday, but maybe I'll

01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:54.980
see some of you at my
office hour tomorrow.

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:58.035
And I will send an email about
where exactly that office

01:16:58.035 --> 01:17:00.030
hour will take place.

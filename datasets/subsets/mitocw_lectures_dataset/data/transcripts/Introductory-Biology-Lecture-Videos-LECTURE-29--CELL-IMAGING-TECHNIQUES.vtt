WEBVTT

00:00:16.763 --> 00:00:17.430
ADAM MARTIN: OK.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.980
So I'm going to start
out today's lecture

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.190
on the wrong foot
by quoting somebody

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.800
that you guys
probably don't know

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.590
and who was a New York Yankee.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.580
So Yogi Berra, the famous
Yankee catcher once said,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.130
"You can observe a
lot by watching," OK?

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.560
And that is very
appropriate for biology

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.350
because a lot of
things in biology

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.940
have been discovered simply
by watching for them in cells

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.620
or watching for them to
happen at the molecular level.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.120
And so our ability
to visualize and see

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.050
what's going on inside cells
and at the molecular level

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.630
is really critical
for the process

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.510
of biological discovery.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.530
So today I'm going to
tell you about tools,

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.940
both sort of older tools but
also kind of the cutting edge,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.210
for how biologists
are really observing

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.080
what's going on in living
cells and in life in general.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.590
OK.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.290
So let me start by just having
you guys think a little bit.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.530
What do you require of me to
see what I write on the board?

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.240
Yeah, Rachel.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.090
AUDIENCE: Light.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.450
ADAM MARTIN: What's that?

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.470
AUDIENCE: Light.

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.770
ADAM MARTIN: You need light.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.610
And what does the
light help you to do?

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.136
What's that?

00:01:53.136 --> 00:01:55.580
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.820
ADAM MARTIN: You need
it to see the board.

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.140
And so let's say
the light's on, OK?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.150
Is that, can you read this?

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.560
No, what's the problem?

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.060
What's that?

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.130
Size, right?

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.440
So Natalie suggested size.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.020
Right, so one
thing that you need

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.230
is some amount of
magnification, right?

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.000
But let's take another--

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.550
let's say I do magnify this.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.610
What if I magnify it?

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.970
And I'm going to start writing
my notes on the board, right?

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.700
How is this?

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.200
Helpful?

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.530
Jeremy, what's wrong?

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.370
AUDIENCE: Differentiate
[INAUDIBLE]..

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.120
ADAM MARTIN: Yeah.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:52.830
You have to be
able to distinguish

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.400
different objects, in this
case, these letters, right?

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.600
So in addition to
just magnifying it,

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.410
you also need the structures
to be far enough apart such

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.190
that you can distinguish them.

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.690
So you need what is
known as resolution.

00:03:13.314 --> 00:03:14.220
OK.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.170
This was resolution.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.630
But this is resolution where
the letters are actually

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.370
resolved, OK?

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:30.750
So structures need to
be far enough apart

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:31.980
so that you can resolve them.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.810
Now let's come back to
Rachel's point, right?

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.760
Why is it that we need light
to see what's on the board?

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.150
Right?

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.145
What if I draw without pressing?

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.510
Right?

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.683
Is that-- yeah, Orey.

00:03:58.683 --> 00:03:59.850
AUDIENCE: You need contrast.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.142
ADAM MARTIN: You need contrast.

00:04:01.142 --> 00:04:02.090
Exactly, right?

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.550
The light sort of gives you
contrast between the chalk

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.920
and the black part of the board.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.555
So you also need contrast.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.550
And contrast is the ability to--

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.750
the structures need
to be differentiated

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.090
from the background, OK?

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:33.700
So structures need to be
different from background.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.590
What else do you need
to read my writing?

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.050
Right?

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:53.905
What if I were just to--

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.340
everyone can read that?

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:07.780
What's wrong?

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.290
Carlos?

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.010
AUDIENCE: Needs to be
clear and legible--

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.630
ADAM MARTIN: What's that?

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.130
Yeah.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.780
I need to have, like,
good handwriting, right?

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.680
So I like to think of this as
this is an aspect of sample

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.720
preservation, OK?

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.070
So there's a sample
preservation issue.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.840
I can't butcher the
letters and the words.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.950
OK.

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.330
So in the process of doing
all these other things, right,

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.480
magnifying your image,
resolving things in your image,

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.130
and generating contrast, you
can't destroy your sample such

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:48.550
that it's illegible,
basically, OK?

00:05:48.550 --> 00:06:00.880
So in this case, structure must
be preserved while doing one

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:02.620
through three on this list.

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.120
OK.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.780
So I'm going to start
with resolution.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.790
We'll talk about, what are
the limits to resolving things

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.500
in biological specimens.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.040
And in biology,
the one instrument

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.100
we use a lot is
a microscope, OK?

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.590
And a microscope is
basically a collection

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:40.210
of lenses that allow you to
do many of the things I just

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.240
drew on the board.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.510
I'll point out a couple
sort of broad sort

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:48.890
of types of microscopy.

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.660
So the human eye up
here can resolve up

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.810
to about 100 to 200
microns, if you're

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.230
looking at something at reading
distant distance, right?

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:02.200
But cells are like way
smaller than that, right?

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:05.060
So we need some
sort of instrument

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:07.630
that allows us to
see things that

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:12.340
is lower than the resolution
limit of a human eye.

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:15.760
And so one way is to
use a light microscope

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.140
where you're using visible
light to observe your sample.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.730
And many of the
images that you're

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.740
seeing that we're
showing you are

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.210
from visible light microscopes.

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:32.170
To see smaller things, type of
microscope that's often used

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.500
is an electron microscope.

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:38.650
And electron microscopy allows
us to observe structures

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.880
all the way down to the sub
nanometer level of resolution,

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.020
OK?

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.680
Now one limitation to
the electron microscope

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:50.560
is, you have to
kill the sample, OK?

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:55.150
So that can lead to
artifacts and problems.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:00.100
And we'll discuss away at the
end where light microscopy is

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.590
being extended
down to the limits

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:07.430
that approximate that of
an electron microscope.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:07.930
OK.

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:12.500
So what determines then, the
resolution of a microscope?

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.510
And so I'm going
to sort of define

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:21.680
a measurement of resolution
which I'll call the d-min,

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:23.870
or minimum distance.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:33.410
And this will be the minimum
distance between two points

00:08:33.410 --> 00:08:34.285
that can be resolved.

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:48.950
OK.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:52.910
And what I showed you on
that past slide is basically

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:56.330
the limit on the right
here is the d-min

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.710
for these different types of
microscopy techniques, OK?

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:03.890
And what that means is, so
the minimum distance would be,

00:09:03.890 --> 00:09:08.180
if your minimum distance is 200
nanometers, if two points are

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:11.540
greater than 200 nanometers
apart from each other,

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.760
then you can distinguish them
as two different objects.

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.880
However, if they are closer
than 200 nanometers together,

00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.710
you wouldn't be able
to see that these

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:23.180
are two different objects.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:26.750
They would be overlapping
each other, OK?

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:31.160
And typically, the d-min
for a light microscope

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.670
is around 200 nanometers, OK?

00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:41.075
And the d-min results,
if we are to determine--

00:09:41.075 --> 00:09:44.330
if I'm to tell you
what determines

00:09:44.330 --> 00:09:48.350
this minimum distance, we have
to think about a microscope.

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:52.220
So here, I'm drawing
a specimen here.

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:54.140
I've just drawn my specimen.

00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.540
It's on a slide or a cover slip.

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.830
Here's your specimen here.

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:02.990
And you might have
a light source

00:10:02.990 --> 00:10:04.070
to generate the contrast.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:11.150
And then there'd be some
sort of objective lens

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:15.710
underneath the slide
and the specimen.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.390
So this would be
an objective lens.

00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:25.790
Sorry about my sample
preservation here.

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:28.700
And so the light is going
to be hitting the sample.

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.120
And the objective lens
will be collecting

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.240
a cone of light that's going
into the lens here, OK?

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:41.430
And maybe I'll magnify this a
bit so you can see it better.

00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:45.540
So I'm just going to magnify
this region over here.

00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:47.840
So if this is my
specimen, I'm going

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.410
to draw the objective a
little farther away this time.

00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:52.730
This is the objective.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.320
And the objective
is able to capture

00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.020
a range of different
angles of light

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.690
that come from the specimen, OK?

00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:06.230
So it's collecting angles.

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:09.030
And I'll just define
here an angle theta,

00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:14.240
which is like the 1/2 angle of
this whole cone of light, OK?

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.880
So what determines
the resolution limit

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:27.470
in this type of system is
first of all, the wavelength

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:30.950
of the light that's used.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:35.150
So if you're using white light,
that might be from 400 to 800.

00:11:35.150 --> 00:11:37.430
If you're exciting
GFP, you're going

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:41.780
to excite with a wavelength
that's 488 nanometers.

00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:46.310
So it's usually around maybe
between 450 and 550 nanometers

00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:48.780
for many different
fluorescent proteins.

00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:49.280
OK.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:12:01.580
So lambda here is the
wavelength of the excitation

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:02.885
of the light you're using.

00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:18.080
And this is all then divided
by 2 times the NA, which is

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.510
a property of the subjective.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:27.890
And what NA is, NA stands
for numerical aperture.

00:12:35.090 --> 00:12:38.810
And what that is, is
basically the range of angles

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:42.800
that this objective
can collect, OK?

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:50.330
So it's N sine theta, where
theta is this angle here.

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:53.690
So you get the best
performance if the objective

00:12:53.690 --> 00:12:56.720
can collect all of
the light that comes

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.530
from this side of the sample.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:13.580
OK, and then N refers to the
refractive index of the media

00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:15.020
that this light
is going through.

00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:18.800
OK.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.860
And so if you have
an objective and you

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:24.920
have your sample
in here and there's

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.390
a slide and a cover slip--

00:13:27.390 --> 00:13:29.300
I'll extend this out--

00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.850
you often have immersion oil.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:35.030
There'd be some sort of
immersion media here.

00:13:41.510 --> 00:13:44.000
And I don't know if you've
ever used a microscope that's

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.190
meant to be used
with immersion media

00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:47.950
and you don't add
that immersion media.

00:13:47.950 --> 00:13:51.350
But your image quality, if
you don't add that media,

00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:53.510
is like really bad, right?

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.800
And that's because
you're affecting

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.830
the numerical aperture of
what this lens can collect.

00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:07.760
And therefore, you degrade
your image quality, OK?

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:11.120
But basically, the more
light, the more angles of

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.280
light that you collect, the
higher the numerical aperture.

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:19.560
And therefore, the lower
this d-min is going to be.

00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:23.990
And so the greater you'll be
able to resolve objects that

00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:26.045
are near each other in space.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:30.690
OK.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:35.190
So the take home
message from all of this

00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.430
is that you notice that
magnification is not

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:39.600
a part of this.

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.590
But the wavelength of the
light is really critical, OK?

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.470
So usually, this
minimum distance

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:48.870
ends up being the
wavelength of light

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.870
that you're using divided by 2.

00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:56.940
And this usually ends up
being about 200 nanometers.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.720
So that's the diffraction
limit of a light microscope,

00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:02.370
as you see up there.

00:15:02.370 --> 00:15:09.240
And this resolution is basically
limited by the diffraction

00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:11.490
or behavior of light, OK?

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:18.330
So light microscopy is limited
by the diffraction of light.

00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.705
And it was thought
for a long time

00:15:29.705 --> 00:15:31.080
that no matter
what you do, you'd

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:34.782
never be able to break this
limit of about 200 nanometers.

00:15:34.782 --> 00:15:36.240
But at the end of
the lecture, I'll

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:39.630
tell you about some very smart
people who figured out a way

00:15:39.630 --> 00:15:41.340
to actually break this limit.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:44.280
And we'll talk about how
they were able to do that.

00:15:46.890 --> 00:15:50.100
Now I want to talk about
a few other limitations

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:54.180
of microscopy.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.510
And I'm starting by showing
you this electron micrograph

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:00.810
of the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:16:00.810 --> 00:16:04.080
And one important
consideration you have to make

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:10.230
is two dimensional versus
three dimensional structure.

00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:13.440
So for electron
microscopy, you basically

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.770
cut the sample so you have
a very thin slice of it.

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:20.010
It's like slicing bread
except these slices are

00:16:20.010 --> 00:16:24.270
on the order of 30 to
60 nanometers in height.

00:16:24.270 --> 00:16:27.990
And then you pass an electron
beam through the sample

00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:32.400
after it's stained in order
to visualize your specimen.

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:34.380
And one thing you
have to keep in mind

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.890
is that, you're looking
at a slice through this.

00:16:37.890 --> 00:16:41.400
And it doesn't give you three
dimensional information, OK?

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:46.110
So if we were to think about
the endoplasmic reticulum,

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:48.811
you might have an
endoplasmic reticulum.

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.900
And if you take an optical
slice through this,

00:16:55.900 --> 00:16:58.360
then you would see something
like this where you see each

00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.920
of the stacks individually.

00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:12.349
And so this might
make you to conclude

00:17:12.349 --> 00:17:15.200
that the way that the
endoplasmic reticulum is

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.310
structured is it's kind of like
a stack of pancakes, where each

00:17:19.310 --> 00:17:22.940
of these, you have
a lipid bilayer

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.210
surrounding a lumen of the ER.

00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:26.810
So right, the lumen
would be inside

00:17:26.810 --> 00:17:29.303
like this for each of these.

00:17:29.303 --> 00:17:31.220
And they're just stacked
on top of each other.

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.000
And this is the textbook model
for endoplasmic reticulum

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.990
structure.

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:44.330
But it was actually, if you
don't consider this in 3D,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:45.410
you might miss something.

00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:49.850
And what was missed
was reported in 2013

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.490
in this paper, where
rather than just taking

00:17:52.490 --> 00:17:57.140
a single slice, what they did
is they made lots of slices.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.400
And they kept track
of where they are.

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:03.770
So they basically did a three
dimensional reconstruction

00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:06.830
of the endoplasmic reticulum.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.040
And by imaging this
other dimension,

00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:12.350
they came to a very
different conclusion

00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:15.860
about how the endoplasmic
reticulum is organized.

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.460
And instead of being
stacks of membranes

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:22.430
on top of each
other like pancakes,

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:24.140
instead, it's a helicoid.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.940
So this is an ER from a
professional secretory cell,

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.990
like a salivary gland cell.

00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:34.130
And you can see in 3D, you
get a very different picture

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.830
of the organization
of this organelle.

00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:42.920
It's actually wrapped around and
spiraling membrane stacks, OK?

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:45.530
So their model is
that, basically

00:18:45.530 --> 00:18:48.890
the endoplasmic reticulum
in some cell types

00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:54.290
basically has a parking
garage like structure, OK?

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.150
So in this case,
in these cells, it

00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:01.950
seems like the ER Is basically
a parking garage for ribosomes.

00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:02.450
OK.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.010
And you don't get
that information

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:06.110
unless you consider
the three dimensional

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:11.940
structure of the thing
that you're looking at.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.170
So in addition to
electron microscopy,

00:19:15.170 --> 00:19:19.220
there are techniques that
involve light microscopy that

00:19:19.220 --> 00:19:21.590
involve optical sectioning.

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.680
And so normally, if you're
looking at fluorescence,

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:26.930
if you're doing
fluorescence microscopy,

00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:30.290
you'd be exciting the
whole volume of your sample

00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.660
and exciting all
of the fluorophores

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:35.630
such that fluorescence
from out of the focal plane

00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:37.610
would be getting
into your image.

00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:41.360
And that would give you a
much more hazy, unclear image.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.360
But there are techniques
such as confocal fluorescence

00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:48.920
microscopy that allow you to
exclude the out of focus light

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.130
such that you're basically
getting an optical section

00:19:52.130 --> 00:19:53.270
through your sample.

00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:56.570
And that can give you a much
cleaner and better resolved

00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:57.700
image, OK?

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:06.470
Now I want to talk a little bit
about another dimension, which

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:08.870
is time.

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:12.950
And again, you're seeing
images in textbooks.

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.500
And usually, you're just
seeing a single image.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.720
And whenever you
see a single image,

00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.190
you have to think
about how things

00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.820
might be changing in time in
order to understand the system.

00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:27.800
So one example that I
like here is shown here,

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.750
where these are
different proteins that

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:32.300
are labeled in a yeast cell.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.970
And you see that these
proteins form patches

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:37.010
at the edge of the yeast cell.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:40.490
And some of these patches just
contain the green protein,

00:20:40.490 --> 00:20:42.260
which is SLA1.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:47.300
And other patches contain just
the red protein which is ABP1.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:52.280
And there's another class of
patch which contains both, OK?

00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:58.573
So how might you interpret
this fixed image over here?

00:20:58.573 --> 00:21:00.365
What might be one model
you would conclude?

00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:10.270
Well, what was
initially concluded

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:14.320
from this type of experiment is
you have three different types

00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.950
of patches that are distinct
from each other in the cell

00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:21.790
because they have different
molecular compositions, OK?

00:21:21.790 --> 00:21:23.830
And that was what was
initially thought.

00:21:23.830 --> 00:21:26.320
But it was wrong
because researchers

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:31.710
had to really consider the
aspect of time in this problem.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:34.900
And I'm going to show
you a movie now over here

00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:37.930
where you're going to
see this yeast cell.

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.360
And now you have these
different proteins

00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:44.830
tagged with different
fluorescent proteins.

00:21:44.830 --> 00:21:49.000
And we can watch them
in time as they progress

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.110
through a stereotypic cycle.

00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:55.480
So what you're going
to notice in this movie

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:59.440
is that you see these
green patches appear.

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.240
And every single green patch
at some point is joined by red.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.330
And then the green disappears
and the red stays around.

00:22:07.330 --> 00:22:10.570
And then the thing
disassembles, OK?

00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:14.980
So what was initially thought
to be three different structures

00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.410
in the cell, eventually,
it was found out

00:22:17.410 --> 00:22:19.900
that there was a
dynamic process where

00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:22.870
this patch sort of
matured over time

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.970
and eventually
disappeared into the cell.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:29.170
And what this process is, is
actually endocytosis in yeast.

00:22:29.170 --> 00:22:30.910
And you're seeing
different proteins

00:22:30.910 --> 00:22:33.670
getting recruited to
endocytic vesicles

00:22:33.670 --> 00:22:37.910
as they bud from the plasma
membrane of this yeast.

00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:38.410
OK.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:42.970
So that's just my caution in
interpreting fixed images,

00:22:42.970 --> 00:22:45.040
because you have
to think about how

00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.750
they might be changing in time.

00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:49.780
All right.

00:22:49.780 --> 00:22:51.715
So now we have to
consider contrast.

00:23:00.748 --> 00:23:08.170
And in bright field microscopy,
and bright field microscopy

00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:13.390
basically involves white
light as your light source.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:22.090
And so you'd have a microscope
that has a white light source.

00:23:22.090 --> 00:23:24.095
You might have
your specimen here.

00:23:24.095 --> 00:23:24.970
Here's your specimen.

00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:32.020
Then you'd have some
sort of detector

00:23:32.020 --> 00:23:33.150
at the end of your system.

00:23:38.070 --> 00:23:41.250
And there would be some
objective lens in between,

00:23:41.250 --> 00:23:43.680
which I'm going
to ignore for now.

00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:47.010
And so, for bright
field microscopy,

00:23:47.010 --> 00:23:51.030
you're taking a sample
and shining it with light.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.150
The light that doesn't
go through your sample

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:55.330
will go right through
to the detector.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:56.760
And that's your background.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:00.390
But some of this light, the
light that's going and hitting

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:06.890
your sample, could be absorbed
or it could be refracted.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.690
And it's the refraction
or absorption

00:24:09.690 --> 00:24:13.020
of this light which generates
the contrast for bright field

00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.380
microscopy.

00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:24.270
So in bright field, native
structures in the cell

00:24:24.270 --> 00:24:34.290
absorb or refract light.

00:24:34.290 --> 00:24:36.390
And this is what
generates the contrast.

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:40.800
OK.

00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:44.910
So the images shown up here are
bright field images of cells.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:47.490
And in each of these
cases, there's no dye.

00:24:47.490 --> 00:24:49.200
There's no fluorescent protein.

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:52.020
But you're able to see
the outline of the cell.

00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:56.340
And you're able to see
even individual organelles

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:59.160
or structures
within the cell that

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:03.790
are interacting with the white
light and generating contrast,

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.040
OK?

00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.760
So that's one way
to generate contrast

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:12.600
is just hope that whatever is
native in your cell generates

00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.500
the contrast.

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.690
But there are also--

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:20.415
you can increase contrast
in specimens by adding dyes.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:28.500
And if these dyes bind
to specific structures

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.940
like a membrane, then that
will increase your contrast.

00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:37.450
So the electron microscopy
images that I showed you--

00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:41.460
so for electron microscopy,
you generate contrast

00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:45.540
by adding a dye that is an
electron-dense dye, which

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:47.560
will bend the electron beam.

00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:53.340
And that's what allows you
to get an image from an EM.

00:25:53.340 --> 00:26:04.230
So an EM contrast is from
an electron-dense dye

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:11.880
such as uranyl acetate or
some other type of dye.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:19.050
Now, fluorescence microscopy, as
Professor Imperiali showed you,

00:26:19.050 --> 00:26:21.300
involves taking a
fluorescent molecule

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:25.230
and attaching it to your
protein of interest.

00:26:25.230 --> 00:26:29.410
So you're actually getting
protein-specific contrast,

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:30.285
which is very useful.

00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:38.250
OK?

00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:40.530
And the way a fluorescence
microscope works

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:44.550
is just shown up here where you
might have a light source that

00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:46.650
has a range of wavelengths.

00:26:46.650 --> 00:26:50.220
And you can use a
filter to select one.

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:54.180
In the case of GFP, it would
be blue light or 488 nanometer

00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.140
light.

00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.190
And that would then be
shined onto your specimen.

00:26:59.190 --> 00:27:02.190
And then the light is
absorbed by fluorophores

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:04.050
in your specimen.

00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.320
Some energy is lost, such
that the light that's

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:12.570
emitted from GFP is a longer
wavelength, in this case,

00:27:12.570 --> 00:27:14.010
green.

00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.290
And then you can
filter again to make

00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:19.830
sure only the green light is
what goes to the detector.

00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:23.490
So this is a very efficient
way of generating contrast

00:27:23.490 --> 00:27:26.220
because you can use
filters to select

00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.070
only the wavelength of
light that is emitted

00:27:29.070 --> 00:27:32.410
from your fluorescent molecule.

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:32.910
OK.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:37.470
Any questions about that and
about my very short version

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:41.120
of how fluorescence
microscopy works?

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:41.770
Yeah, Rachel?

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:45.460
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
dichroic mirror?

00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:49.200
ADAM MARTIN: The dichroic mirror
reflects certain wavelengths

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.120
that are below a
certain wavelength.

00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.600
And will pass wavelengths
that are above a wavelength.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:58.800
So it will basically reflect
the excitation light.

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:04.140
But it will pass the
emitted light, OK?

00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:08.310
And so, there are
tons of these mirrors.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.180
Some are not
dichroic, but they can

00:28:12.180 --> 00:28:13.920
reflect four
different wavelengths

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.200
and pass all other wavelengths.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:19.350
And so, this allows you to
image multiple fluorophores

00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:21.810
at the same time, OK?

00:28:21.810 --> 00:28:24.000
The specifics
aren't as important

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.450
as the general concept
of how this works.

00:28:28.450 --> 00:28:28.950
OK.

00:28:28.950 --> 00:28:32.880
Now I want to come back
to the resolution limit.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.600
And I want to tell you
about how we can beat it.

00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.240
So, beating.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.650
We all like winning.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.640
So beating the
diffraction limit.

00:28:49.530 --> 00:28:56.940
And this is going to involve
a type of microscopy that's

00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.870
really sort of been developed in
the past decade, which is known

00:29:00.870 --> 00:29:02.910
as super resolution microscopy.

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:11.070
So super resolution microscopy.

00:29:11.070 --> 00:29:12.690
And remember, I
mentioned for you

00:29:12.690 --> 00:29:17.340
before that yes,
electron microscopy can

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.310
get you nanometer resolution.

00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:24.000
But you have to kill the cell.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.080
And also, it's hard to get
protein specific contrast,

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:28.830
right?

00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:31.050
So that kind of sucks
because as biologists,

00:29:31.050 --> 00:29:33.630
usually we're interested
in how things are

00:29:33.630 --> 00:29:36.660
functioning to stay, to live.

00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.570
So wouldn't it be great
if we could somehow

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:45.000
use light microscopy to get
down into this nanometer range

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.690
so that we can see how
individual proteins are

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:51.420
interacting with each
other and organized

00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.310
at the nanometer level, OK?

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.990
And so in the past
decade, there's

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:58.080
really been a revolution
that's enabled

00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:02.700
us to do light microscopy with
a resolution that gets down

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.120
to the 10 or even single
nanometer resolution.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.330
And there's a number of
different super resolution

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:15.530
techniques.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:19.680
I'm going to talk
about just one of them.

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.130
But both these
techniques basically

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:27.770
use the same concept, which
is that they enable whoever's

00:30:27.770 --> 00:30:31.910
doing it to identify
single molecules

00:30:31.910 --> 00:30:35.990
and define where those
molecules are very precisely.

00:30:35.990 --> 00:30:39.410
And to turn fluorescent
molecules on and off

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:42.170
so that you can select
individual molecules such

00:30:42.170 --> 00:30:44.360
that you can see them.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:48.410
So these are two
different techniques.

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.790
They're conceptually
very similar.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:53.030
I'm going to focus
on this one here.

00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:57.100
But it's pretty much
similar to this one up here.

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:05.300
And I just want to point out
that one of our colleagues

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:10.250
here at MIT, Ibrahim Cisse
who's in the physics department,

00:31:10.250 --> 00:31:14.870
his lab builds these super
resolution microscopes.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:17.810
And they're using super
resolution microscopy

00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:21.470
to study the collective
behaviors of proteins,

00:31:21.470 --> 00:31:26.650
in his case, during the
function of gene expression.

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:30.665
OK, so this is research that's
actively being pursued at MIT.

00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:36.710
So let's just do a
thought experiment again.

00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:44.210
OK.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:48.530
I'm drawing a single molecule or
what you would see in an image

00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:50.840
if you were looking at
a single molecule GFP.

00:31:54.550 --> 00:31:55.050
Great.

00:31:55.050 --> 00:31:56.070
Where is GFP here?

00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:02.293
Carmen?

00:32:02.293 --> 00:32:03.960
AUDIENCE: It's right
there on the board.

00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.043
ADAM MARTIN: It's right
there on the board, right?

00:32:06.043 --> 00:32:08.540
Is it here?

00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:09.664
What's that?

00:32:09.664 --> 00:32:11.110
AUDIENCE: I don't know.

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:15.160
ADAM MARTIN: Who thinks
GFP is right here?

00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.990
Who does not think
GFP is right there?

00:32:21.550 --> 00:32:23.640
You have to be thinking
one or the other.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:24.722
Yeah, Rachel.

00:32:24.722 --> 00:32:26.410
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:26.410 --> 00:32:27.340
ADAM MARTIN: OK.

00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.920
So what Rachel says is that
it's probably not right here.

00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.180
It's probably in the middle
of this thing, right?

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:38.140
And so if you're seeing a
diffraction limited spot,

00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:40.760
you're going to get some sort
of Gaussian of intensity,

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.010
which I didn't draw well here.

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:44.230
But it might be a little
bit brighter in the center

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:48.010
and drop off as you go
towards the edge, right?

00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:50.440
So if I were to take
a image intensity

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:53.920
profile along the
line here, you'd

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.520
see something that kind of
looked like a Gaussian, OK?

00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:02.500
And GFP, if there's a single
molecule that you're imaging,

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.520
should be right in the
center of this Gaussian, OK?

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:10.930
And so even though
we're not seeing a spot,

00:33:10.930 --> 00:33:14.440
we're seeing a spot
that its width here

00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:17.170
is diffraction limited.

00:33:17.170 --> 00:33:19.900
So this width is 200 nanometers.

00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:24.370
But if we can estimate
where the molecule is

00:33:24.370 --> 00:33:27.250
in this region with
nanometer precision,

00:33:27.250 --> 00:33:29.560
we could get a
very accurate view

00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:33.190
of where this fluorescent
molecule is, OK?

00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.720
So it relies on
certain assumptions.

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.210
The first assumption
is that you're

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:47.820
assuming we can see single
fluorescent molecules.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:55.230
So that we visualize single
fluorescent molecules.

00:33:58.530 --> 00:34:01.680
And that we can then estimate
with some amount of precision

00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.610
the location of
the molecule based

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:09.389
on this diffraction limited
sort of image that we get.

00:34:09.389 --> 00:34:20.190
So then we have to estimate the
location based on the image.

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.199
OK.

00:34:25.199 --> 00:34:28.500
And then our resolution
is basically the error

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.830
in fitting this curve, OK?

00:34:31.830 --> 00:34:42.810
So the error in
the fitted position

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:47.649
is equal to the standard
deviation of this Gaussian.

00:34:47.649 --> 00:34:51.989
The standard deviation
divided by the square root

00:34:51.989 --> 00:34:53.850
of the number of
photons that you

00:34:53.850 --> 00:34:56.280
collected to get that image.

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:59.445
So the square root of
the number of photons.

00:35:02.420 --> 00:35:03.150
OK.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:06.330
And I just told you in the
beginning of the lecture

00:35:06.330 --> 00:35:08.700
that this standard
deviation is limited

00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.500
by the diffraction of light.

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.870
So the standard
deviation is going

00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:16.050
to be around 200
nanometers, right?

00:35:16.050 --> 00:35:18.330
But if you collect
a lot of photons,

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:23.760
you can accurately figure out
where the fluorescent molecule

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:27.110
is here if you know that
it's a single molecule.

00:35:27.110 --> 00:35:27.610
OK?

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:34.440
So the number of photons
in a typical experiment

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.990
is going to be around
10 to the fourth, OK?

00:35:37.990 --> 00:35:41.880
And so if 200 nanometers
by 10 to the fourth,

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:45.270
you're going to have
sub nanometer resolution

00:35:45.270 --> 00:35:48.010
if you do the experiment right.

00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:49.350
OK?

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:52.230
So you really need to see
fluorescent molecules, however,

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:54.420
in order to do this, OK?

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.140
And the real breakthrough
came with the realization

00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:01.530
that you could combine
this type of fitting

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:05.160
to estimate the position
of single molecules

00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:08.700
with a certain type
of fluorescent protein

00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:13.690
where you can turn the protein
on and off stochastically, OK?

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:14.190
OK.

00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:16.710
So we need one more
component which

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:25.470
is a photo-activatable
fluorescent protein,

00:36:25.470 --> 00:36:31.170
in this case, the first one was
photo-activatable GFP PA-GFP.

00:36:35.730 --> 00:36:39.900
And PA-GFP is a fluorescent
protein like GPF.

00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.760
It's genetically encoded.

00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:44.370
But when it matures,
it's not fluorescent.

00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:46.530
It's in a dark state, OK?

00:36:46.530 --> 00:36:50.240
So when it matures, it's dark.

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.280
It has a dark state.

00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:55.920
And it starts out
in this dark state.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:57.810
But you can turn it on.

00:36:57.810 --> 00:37:00.850
And you can turn
it on with light.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.850
So that's where the
photo activation

00:37:02.850 --> 00:37:04.830
is, because you're
able to photo activate

00:37:04.830 --> 00:37:06.810
this fluorescent molecule.

00:37:06.810 --> 00:37:13.110
And you can photo activate
with sort of UV light or 405

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.260
nanometer light.

00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:20.190
And so that's not normally
the excitation wavelength.

00:37:20.190 --> 00:37:26.250
But if you shine your sample
with 405 nanometer light,

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:29.910
it will convert some
set of your molecules

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:33.440
into the now
fluorescent state, OK?

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:39.060
So this then causes
it to be fluorescent.

00:37:42.288 --> 00:37:43.830
And now it's going
to be lighting up.

00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:51.660
OK.

00:37:51.660 --> 00:37:54.690
And I want to thank Professor
Cisse because he gave me

00:37:54.690 --> 00:37:56.640
the next slide
which I think nicely

00:37:56.640 --> 00:37:58.535
shows how this technique works.

00:38:01.050 --> 00:38:06.270
So the way you can
get super resolution

00:38:06.270 --> 00:38:08.580
is you can't be looking
at all your fluorophores

00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:11.130
at once because they're
not far enough apart

00:38:11.130 --> 00:38:13.170
and they'll all bleed
together so that you

00:38:13.170 --> 00:38:15.390
get a bad image, right?

00:38:15.390 --> 00:38:17.670
So this would be your
conventional diffraction

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:20.280
limited image where all
the fluorophores-- there's

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.790
about 20 fluorophores here.

00:38:21.790 --> 00:38:24.270
And you can see, you can't
see individual fluorophores

00:38:24.270 --> 00:38:27.930
and you can't see
what that says, OK?

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:31.290
But if you take a divide
and conquer approach

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:34.320
with this, if you have
a photo-activatable GFP,

00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.910
you don't need to look
at them all at once.

00:38:36.910 --> 00:38:40.710
You can just look at
three to start, OK?

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:43.860
So now if you only
activate a small subset

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:47.580
and you ensure that you're
activating it at a frequency

00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:50.370
such that they're well
resolved from each other,

00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:52.920
then you can distinguish
that there are

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.150
three single molecules here.

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:57.330
You can fit where they are.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:39:00.330
And now you know where they
are with nanometer precision.

00:39:00.330 --> 00:39:02.820
So you know where those are.

00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:05.400
And then you want to
look at other molecules.

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:07.050
And so you have to
get rid of these.

00:39:07.050 --> 00:39:11.190
And so what you would
do is to bleach them.

00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:14.820
And bleaching is to use
light to basically damage

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:20.190
the fluorophores and get it
to no longer fluoresce, OK?

00:39:20.190 --> 00:39:25.230
So this process is going to
involve an iterative photo

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:42.270
activation followed by
measuring and fitting the image

00:39:42.270 --> 00:39:44.790
so that you can
basically determine

00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:48.720
where each single
molecule is in your image.

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:53.400
And then ending with bleaching
to get rid of the fluorophores

00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.060
you just turned on so that
everything is now dark again.

00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.390
And then you repeat
this process iteratively

00:40:00.390 --> 00:40:06.030
to collect all of the single
molecules that you can, OK?

00:40:06.030 --> 00:40:10.140
So in this case, we just
got these three molecules.

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.180
We would then want
to bleach them

00:40:12.180 --> 00:40:14.940
so that we're now going to
look at different fluorescent

00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.013
molecules.

00:40:16.013 --> 00:40:17.430
And we'll turn on
a certain number

00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:19.920
of other fluorescent molecules.

00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:21.570
Here you see four.

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.200
Here are two.

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.867
They're a little close
together, but you

00:40:23.867 --> 00:40:25.050
can see that there are two.

00:40:25.050 --> 00:40:25.980
Here are another two.

00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:30.360
They're close together, but you
see two clear intensity peaks.

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.850
And so you can fit those four.

00:40:31.850 --> 00:40:35.880
Now you have four more
molecules to make up your image.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:39.480
You bleach them, excite
or activate five more.

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.640
Here are five
fluorescent molecules.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.870
You can fit those.

00:40:42.870 --> 00:40:44.700
Determine their positions.

00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.130
And you just do this
iteratively over and over

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:51.130
again till you get as
many molecules as you can.

00:40:51.130 --> 00:40:55.440
And at the end, you basically
add all these images together

00:40:55.440 --> 00:41:00.840
to get the final super
resolution image, OK?

00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.560
So this is an iterative process
where the photo activation

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:08.220
allows you to image
single molecules such

00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:13.043
that you can see where they
are with nanometer precision.

00:41:13.043 --> 00:41:14.460
And then you add
them all together

00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:17.680
to get a super resolution image.

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:20.890
Here is an example
of this in practice.

00:41:20.890 --> 00:41:22.680
And this is the
storm technique which

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:25.170
doesn't involve a photo
activatable fluorescent

00:41:25.170 --> 00:41:28.110
protein, but involves
organic dyes blinking.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:32.160
And the concept is
basically the same.

00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:35.430
And here you see a
conventional image of an axon.

00:41:35.430 --> 00:41:37.830
And it's labeled with
this beta-II spectrin.

00:41:37.830 --> 00:41:41.430
And you see beta-II
spectrin is continuous.

00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:43.620
And it's staining in this axon.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:46.700
But if you look at the
super resolution image, what

00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:49.080
you see is the beta
spectrin actually

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:53.190
has this repeated periodic
pattern along the axon.

00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:55.770
And this is a
cytoskeletal element

00:41:55.770 --> 00:41:58.260
that's basically
present in rings up

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:01.595
and down the axons of neurons.

00:42:01.595 --> 00:42:02.970
And you can kind
of think of this

00:42:02.970 --> 00:42:05.760
as like the axon is
a vacuum hose, where

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.130
you have these rigid
sort of rings that

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:10.710
are aligned all along the axon.

00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:13.980
But because it's repeated and
you have intervening areas

00:42:13.980 --> 00:42:16.680
without much cytoskeleton,
you can kind of

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:18.300
think of it as a
way for the axon

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:24.150
to be both rigid but also
flexible and maneuverable.

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:29.010
I just wanted to point out
that several super resolution

00:42:29.010 --> 00:42:34.350
techniques were recognized
in the 2014 Nobel

00:42:34.350 --> 00:42:36.750
Prize in chemistry.

00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:41.490
Eric Betzig on the left
here developed the approach

00:42:41.490 --> 00:42:46.200
using the photo activatable
GFP that I described to you.

00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.000
And two others, Stefan
Hell and W.E. Moerner

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.050
were awarded it for other types
of super resolution technique.

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.920
If you get a chance, you should
go to the Nobel Prize website

00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:04.160
and listen to Eric
Betzig's Nobel lecture.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.170
He has a very interesting story.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:09.230
And part of it
involved how he managed

00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:11.280
to develop this technique.

00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.360
And he actually developed it in
the living room of his friend.

00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:17.810
So this is actually one of
the first super resolution

00:43:17.810 --> 00:43:19.520
microscopes.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:21.240
Here's the microscope
and here you see--

00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:22.820
I love this chair.

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.790
But you see, you basically
have this microscope

00:43:25.790 --> 00:43:28.410
in this guy's living room.

00:43:28.410 --> 00:43:30.290
So if you want to hear
more about this story,

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.770
listen to his Nobel lecture.

00:43:31.770 --> 00:43:33.950
He's a really funny
guy and you get

00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:36.440
a sense of how
science really works

00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:39.080
where you get this
unemployed guy like building

00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:41.180
a microscope in his
friend's living room

00:43:41.180 --> 00:43:42.500
and then wins a Nobel Prize.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:49.640
And just one reminder to end
today, remember your news brief

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.670
is due this Friday,
November 30th.

00:43:52.670 --> 00:43:54.830
If you need help on
selecting a topic,

00:43:54.830 --> 00:43:58.020
please see a member
of our staff,

00:43:58.020 --> 00:44:01.400
including Professor
Imperiali or myself.

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:03.380
And so, good luck with that.

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:04.040
Thank you.

00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.920
I'm all set.

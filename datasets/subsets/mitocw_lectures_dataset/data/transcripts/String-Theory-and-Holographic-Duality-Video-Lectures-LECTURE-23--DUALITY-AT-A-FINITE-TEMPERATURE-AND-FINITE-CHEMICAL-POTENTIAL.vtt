00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:28.320
PROFESSOR: So last time we
talked about how to describe

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.180
say for the boundary CFT is at
a finite temperature what would

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.475
be its gravity description?

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.090
So what we described
was a thermal theory.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:57.510
Say a Thermal CFT on
the flat space, OK?

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:14.180
We show that this is related
to a black hole with a planar

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.680
horizon.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.360
The key is that the horizon
should have the same topology

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.115
as the boundary space.

00:01:30.495 --> 00:01:37.870
So in terms of the picture
this is your boundary,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:48.060
so this is z equal to 0, and
then the horizon somewhere say,

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.550
at some value of z0.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.570
So horizon has some value
of z0 and then the horizon

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.585
have the same topology
as the boundary on space.

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:07.800
And then you can do some of
the [? lamicks, ?] et cetera.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.960
Any questions about that?

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.290
Good.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.520
So previously we also
briefly discussed

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.342
that the Ads also allow
you to put the field

00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:25.050
theory on the sphere.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.550
So if you put the field
theory on the sphere

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.810
then that will be due
to the global Ads.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.980
Now you can ask
the same question.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.190
What happens if we put the
boundary theory on the sphere

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.940
and then put there the
finite temperature.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:57.237
So let us put a
CFT on the sphere

00:02:57.237 --> 00:02:58.320
at the finite temperature.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.320
So the story here is much
richer for a very simple reason.

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.690
For a very simple reason.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:32.290
So if you have a CFT just on the
Rd minus 1 so this Rd minus 1,

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.200
this euclidean space,
euclidean flat space

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.300
does not have a scale and the
CFT does not have a scale.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.890
So if you put it at
a finite temperature

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.790
then the temperature
is the only scale,

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.700
and essentially provide
a unit over the scale.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.200
So the temperature
is the only scale,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:11.375
so essentially providing
an energy unit.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.270
So this means that for CFT on
the finite temperature, CFT,

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:42.000
on the flat space then
physics at all temperatures

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.590
are the same.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:59.890
So they are just related
by a scaling of units.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.930
So in some sense you can see it
seems that the physics is very

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.710
simple whether you
have like 0.0001 degree

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.380
or you have 10,000
degrees, doesn't matter.

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.252
And it's only the relative
scale that matters.

00:05:25.252 --> 00:05:27.210
So the physics at all
temperatures is the same.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.620
There's no difference
between the low temperature

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:31.300
and the high temperature,
and the temperature just

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.490
provide the units.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.360
But if you put the
CFT on the sphere

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.630
now the story's different.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:51.210
So for CFT on the sphere because
the sphere has a side itself.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.160
OK, so let's take the
sphere have both sides r.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.470
Again when you put
the CFT on the sphere

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.050
the sides of the sphere does
not matter because again

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.350
the sides of the
sphere are essentially

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.970
provide by the units because the
theory's getting [? warrant. ?]

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.700
So let's just put all
the sides to be r.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.620
So let's take sides to be r.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.902
And the r can be
chosen to be the same

00:06:20.902 --> 00:06:22.610
as the curvature radius
in the [? back ?]

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:25.480
just to make formula
simple, and you

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:28.400
can choose it to be any radius.

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:32.470
And now since the sphere
already have [? all ?] sides

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:34.770
and now you put it at
a finite temperature.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:37.660
Now you have the
dimensionless number.

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:45.490
Then at the finite
temperature in the physics

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:59.650
is controlled by a
dimensionless number, r times t.

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:07.820
So now the temperature
makes a difference.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.530
Now different
temperature that r is

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.420
is different because now
you have a relative scale

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:17.190
and if rt is small
then essentially you're

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:19.555
at the low temperature,
and then when rt is big

00:07:19.555 --> 00:07:20.930
then you have a
high temperature.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:22.790
Now there's a
dimensionless number

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:25.200
to characterize whether
you're in the low temperature

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:27.210
or in the high temperature.

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:30.460
So the physics essentially
become much richer because

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:35.627
of the and then you have a
you have a whole parameter

00:07:35.627 --> 00:07:36.710
the physics can depend on.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:49.390
And so indeed the story
become rather intricate

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:51.160
whether we can see
the finite temperature

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.690
theory on the sphere
so now let me just

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.150
mention some important features.

00:08:04.970 --> 00:08:12.300
So I will walk you not too
slowly but also not too quickly

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:13.920
about the physics on the sphere.

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.650
We cannot afford to do it
very slowly at this time.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.250
Yeah, but if I do
it too quickly,

00:08:23.250 --> 00:08:25.590
of course you won't
learn anything.

00:08:25.590 --> 00:08:31.320
OK, so let me just point
out some important features.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.919
So first, when we
talked about the story

00:08:33.919 --> 00:08:36.860
last week-- when we talked
about the finite temperature

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.120
on the flat space-- we
said, oh, probably there

00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:46.810
are two possible descriptions
for finite temperature

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.220
theory from the
[? back ?] point of view.

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.520
So one is that you can
have a thermal gas.

00:08:57.191 --> 00:08:58.440
You have a thermal gas in Ads.

00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:04.100
But then we argue
that for a theory

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.970
on the sphere that's
not allowed because you

00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:11.210
encompass singularity because
the metric becomes singular.

00:09:11.210 --> 00:09:15.740
And the one big difference
for the theory on the sphere

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:19.170
is that actually
now this is allowed.

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.873
So the thermal gas in
Ads is now allowed.

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.230
So now let's go
through the argument.

00:09:30.230 --> 00:09:32.955
So now first let me just write
down the global Ads metric.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:42.500
Of course you can write in
many different coordinates.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:43.960
So the most
convenient coordinates

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.220
to write global Ads for our
purpose is the following.

00:09:54.530 --> 00:10:14.840
So this is just a pure Ads
and r goes to 0 to infinite.

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:17.630
So this is like somewhat
analog of a, say,

00:10:17.630 --> 00:10:21.370
sprinkle coordinate
in flat space.

00:10:21.370 --> 00:10:23.180
But the difference
is of course now

00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:27.010
you have nontrivial
factors which tell

00:10:27.010 --> 00:10:30.090
you're in the curve space time.

00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:40.430
So now to go to
the thermal Ads we

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:45.890
do the trick you normally
do for thermal field theory.

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:51.470
Is that you go to
euclidean space

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:55.110
and then you put
the euclidean time

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:58.290
to be periodic in the
inverse temperature.

00:11:01.365 --> 00:11:05.940
Actually, let me write
down here the analogous

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.955
metric on the sphere.

00:11:15.770 --> 00:11:17.720
So this is a situation
we can see that

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:23.940
before for the theory on the
flat space, on the plane,

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.870
and then that would be the
metric to be on the sphere.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.230
So we've talked about
last time if you

00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:36.720
make tau to be
periodic then as z

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:41.400
goes to infinity then this
circle shrink to zero sides.

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:45.040
Because the prefactor goes to 0.

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.680
So the tau circle
will have a sides beta

00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.640
but the proper densities
controlled by the prefactor.

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.370
And because when z goes to
infinity then the proper lens

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.740
of the circle goes to 0.

00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.060
So whenever you have a
circle we shrink to 0

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:04.380
then you have a singular
behavior, et cetera,

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:07.730
and then the metric's singular.

00:12:07.730 --> 00:12:10.670
So you can have [? where ?]
it is a singular behavior

00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:15.240
and so that's why this
is not the amount.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:19.860
But now in this case, when you
do such energy configuration

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.950
this becomes well defined.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:28.630
Because of the proper sides
of the tau circle so now you

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:37.790
local proper lens local proper
sides over the tau circle,

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:44.140
it's just given by
this prefactor 1 plus

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:49.200
r squared divided by 1
squared by r squared beta.

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.640
And since a greater
equal here so

00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.080
this is greater equal to beta.

00:13:02.230 --> 00:13:04.390
So actually this is
bounded from below.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.780
So this is a circle [? label ?]
will become too small.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:12.720
Essentially the minimal
side of the circle

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.502
is the same as the beta itself.

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.860
So this euclidean metric
is perfectly well defined.

00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:32.410
OK, so euclidean
metric well defined.

00:13:45.400 --> 00:14:02.240
So you can trust here that the
euclidean metric is singular

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.600
as z goes to infinity.

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:12.037
If you put the 0 in
the flat space then

00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:13.870
that's not allowed but
in this case allowed.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.590
So for the serial
in the sphere--

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.356
but still there's an analog
of a black hole solution.

00:14:24.356 --> 00:14:25.730
You can also find
the black hole.

00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:39.580
Again you just write
down the standards,

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:43.720
sprinkle's metric answers,
for black hole metric

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.060
and then you solve
Einstein equation,

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:50.970
then you find-- so let me
just write down the answer.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:55.525
So you find that this space also
allows a black hole solution.

00:14:55.525 --> 00:14:56.870
Can be written as the following.

00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:12.695
So now f just slight
generalization of this factor.

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.670
So the mu is primarily
related to black hole mass.

00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:44.170
And the horizon is that
i equal to r0 and r

00:15:44.170 --> 00:15:46.330
satisfy that this
factor goes to 0.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:02.460
So you can also find out what
is temperature associated

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:03.550
with this black hole.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.580
So here that beta
can be anything.

00:16:12.609 --> 00:16:14.025
There's no constraint
on the beta.

00:16:22.430 --> 00:16:25.462
So here using the standard
technique to find what

00:16:25.462 --> 00:16:27.420
is the Hawking temperature
for this black hole.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.480
Let me just write
down the answer.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.480
So this is just 4 pi
divided by f prime.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:38.590
You've already add to the
horizon standard formula

00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:42.830
and you just find
the 0 of this guy,

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:47.297
and then you just
take the derivative

00:16:47.297 --> 00:16:49.380
so you find the beta can
be written in terms of r0

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:49.879
as follows.

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:56.920
So this is just
a simple algebra.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:05.359
So you find that if you
take the derivative,

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:07.520
we express the
derivative is r0, then

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:10.130
you find the Hawking temperature
of the following form.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.565
I'm not doing this
calculation here.

00:17:18.565 --> 00:17:19.940
You can use it to
check yourself.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.620
Good, any questions so far?

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:28.245
So now it seems like
we have a problem.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.570
Because we have a
black hole we also

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:38.640
have a standard thermal Ads.

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.140
Then which one is
the right description

00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:46.435
for the field theory at
the finite temperature?

00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:55.540
Seems like we have a choice.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:01.730
But now if you look
at this function

00:18:01.730 --> 00:18:04.360
the story's even more
tricky than that.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.900
So this product of this function
this is a rough behavior

00:18:06.900 --> 00:18:08.040
of this function.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.180
So this is the
inverse temperature

00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:14.090
and then this is the
sides of the horizon.

00:18:14.090 --> 00:18:16.850
And the side of the
horizon essentially

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.830
determines your entropy.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:21.010
So it's really a
physical thing here

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:24.520
and because of the area over
the horizon it's the entropy.

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.960
The area of the
horizon is a entropy.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.740
So this r0 it can be considered
as something standard

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.240
for entropy.

00:18:35.970 --> 00:18:38.110
So now just to
get the intrusion,

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:41.450
this is a complicated
function, it's

00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.590
because intrusion and
how this beta depend

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.600
on this r0, the horizon side.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:58.460
Suppose horizon side is
very small, r0 goes to 0,

00:18:58.460 --> 00:18:59.720
then downstairs is finite.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:03.470
Upstairs goes to 0
so you just go to 0.

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:13.580
And the r0 is very
large so the downstairs

00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:17.090
proportionate to r0
square but upstairs only

00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:22.350
proportionate to r0 so
when r0 is very large

00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:26.720
we go to 0 as the r0.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.150
And this is a small
function so there

00:19:29.150 --> 00:19:30.470
must be a maximum somewhere.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:35.640
And because you can easily
find the maximum just

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.080
to take the derivative
of that function.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.185
Anyway, so that's how the
beta will depend on r.

00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:50.710
But now this plot
is highly peculiar.

00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:51.617
Why?

00:19:51.617 --> 00:19:52.450
Can you tell me why?

00:20:02.950 --> 00:20:08.030
There's a maximum on
theta, which means?

00:20:08.030 --> 00:20:09.040
That's right.

00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:12.110
So there's a beta max.

00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:26.009
So that means this is a beta
max which tells you there's

00:20:26.009 --> 00:20:26.925
a minimum temperature.

00:20:29.744 --> 00:20:31.410
That means that black
hole solution only

00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:36.220
exist above a certain
minimal temperature.

00:20:36.220 --> 00:20:38.730
And you can easily find out
what is that minimal temperature

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.420
just by taking the
derivative of this function

00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:42.690
and it require to be 0.

00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:52.210
Is there any other thing
peculiar regarding this plot?

00:20:54.970 --> 00:20:56.590
AUDIENCE: When r0--

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:57.215
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:20:57.215 --> 00:21:00.630
AUDIENCE: When r0,
[INAUDIBLE] black hole.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:02.697
PROFESSOR: Well, r0 is
0-- the black hole becomes

00:21:02.697 --> 00:21:03.530
smaller and smaller.

00:21:03.530 --> 00:21:05.229
It means there's no black hole.

00:21:05.229 --> 00:21:06.978
AUDIENCE: But the
temperature is infinity.

00:21:06.978 --> 00:21:07.434
PROFESSOR: Hmm?

00:21:07.434 --> 00:21:09.433
AUDIENCE: But the temperature
there is infinity.

00:21:11.682 --> 00:21:12.550
That's weird.

00:21:12.550 --> 00:21:14.337
PROFESSOR: No, that's not weird.

00:21:14.337 --> 00:21:16.420
No, that's the standard,
the flat space black hole

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.032
behaves that way.

00:21:19.032 --> 00:21:21.240
Just look at a Schwarzschild
black hole in flat space

00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:23.670
when the horizon side
becomes smaller and smaller

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:27.500
the temperature become
higher and higher.

00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:31.105
That's a standard
feature of flat space.

00:21:31.105 --> 00:21:32.886
AUDIENCE: It must
be the other way.

00:21:32.886 --> 00:21:34.510
If you have a huge
black hole, then why

00:21:34.510 --> 00:21:37.312
is it that the beta goes down?

00:21:37.312 --> 00:21:38.615
That seems bizarre.

00:21:38.615 --> 00:21:40.240
Maybe it can't also
be standard, right?

00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:50.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:55.690
PROFESSOR: Both things you said
are correct and are important

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:58.150
but there's something
more elementary

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.250
you're not pointing out.

00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:02.200
You're pointing out the higher
order of important things.

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.625
But there's one lower order
important thing that which

00:22:04.625 --> 00:22:05.815
is not yet pointed out.

00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:09.085
AUDIENCE: There
are two solutions

00:22:09.085 --> 00:22:10.950
of the same temperature.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:12.690
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:22:12.690 --> 00:22:16.145
In terms of the temperature
this is a [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:16.145 --> 00:22:17.770
So if you look at
the given temperature

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.061
they're actually two solutions.

00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:31.255
So for any given temperature
there are two solutions.

00:22:35.810 --> 00:22:40.640
Say T greater than
T min so this is

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.800
for the beta smaller
than beta max

00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.305
means that T greater than T
min There are two solutions.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:55.130
And then we have to
label them so let's

00:22:55.130 --> 00:23:00.010
very imaginatively call this
one the big black hole and then

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:02.410
this one the small black hole.

00:23:02.410 --> 00:23:04.450
Because this one have a
larger size and this one

00:23:04.450 --> 00:23:07.390
has a smaller size.

00:23:07.390 --> 00:23:11.620
So this corresponding
to the r0 of those two.

00:23:14.039 --> 00:23:15.580
So you have two
black hole solutions.

00:23:15.580 --> 00:23:17.580
One have a larger radius
than the other one.

00:23:20.130 --> 00:23:25.766
So we have big black hole
and a small black hole.

00:23:25.766 --> 00:23:28.370
And now this is
an important thing

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:35.490
you mentioned that for
the small black hole

00:23:35.490 --> 00:23:44.690
the temperature when
you decrease the sides

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:45.775
the beta decrease.

00:23:45.775 --> 00:23:47.525
That then means the
temperature increases.

00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:55.660
So this as I said
it's like an entropy.

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:58.260
So if you lower
the entropy somehow

00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:01.020
your temperature increases.

00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.520
So when you increase
the temperature

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.853
you actually lower the entropy
for the small black hole.

00:24:04.853 --> 00:24:06.722
A small black hole
you go like this.

00:24:06.722 --> 00:24:07.460
Go like this.

00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:11.960
When you reduce the sides,
you reduce the beta,

00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.890
means you increase
the temperature.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:16.865
But this is actually the
standard Schwarzschild black

00:24:16.865 --> 00:24:18.700
hole behavior in flat space.

00:24:18.700 --> 00:24:23.430
And this just tells you have
[? a lack ?] of specific heat.

00:24:26.940 --> 00:24:28.954
So this is a situation
we understand.

00:24:28.954 --> 00:24:30.370
This is a situation
we can come up

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.060
with a flat space, a
Schwarzchild black hole.

00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:39.110
And it make sense why it's
happening here because here

00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:43.800
roughly is order r.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.190
Because the r is
the scale here so

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.130
the maximum location where the
maximum is controlled by the r.

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:55.330
So this region corresponding
to sides of the black hole

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:59.126
to be much, much smaller
than Ads curvature radius.

00:24:59.126 --> 00:25:00.500
So when something
is much smaller

00:25:00.500 --> 00:25:04.348
than the curvature
radius what you do see?

00:25:04.348 --> 00:25:05.260
Hmm?

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:06.614
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:06.614 --> 00:25:07.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah, flat space.

00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.510
Yeah, it just like even though
we live in the curved universe

00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:14.190
but we actually see flat space
because of course our scale

00:25:14.190 --> 00:25:17.720
is much more than curvature
radius of universe.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.600
And a similar key thing here
even though the black hole

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.240
have a size much smaller than
the curvature radius of Ads

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:26.562
they essentially behave
like flat space black hole.

00:25:26.562 --> 00:25:28.770
And so that's exactly what
you see for the flat space

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:30.600
black hole.

00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.300
And indeed, in a
more interesting

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:39.180
is this big black hole,
the [? interesting ?]

00:25:39.180 --> 00:25:41.140
is a big black hole.

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:45.670
And the big black hole when
r0 increases the temperature

00:25:45.670 --> 00:25:47.780
increase.

00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.680
So this is the right way.

00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:58.920
So this is indeed the standard,
just positive specific heat.

00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:06.050
You can check it has
positive specific heat.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:10.020
So this is indeed what you'd
expect from a thermal system.

00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.140
And so this is indeed what you
expect from a thermal system.

00:26:17.090 --> 00:26:21.100
So now we are encountering
an even weirder situation.

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.160
We not only have so more ideas.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.120
We're not only have black hole.

00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.495
We actually have
two black holes.

00:26:31.187 --> 00:26:33.270
So what's actually described
with the field theory

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:35.880
at finite temperature?

00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.940
So what does this really mean?

00:26:38.940 --> 00:26:40.780
Number two is a
black hole solution.

00:26:40.780 --> 00:26:44.680
Now let's look at
the number three.

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:47.254
So now let's look at
what are the indications

00:26:47.254 --> 00:26:47.920
those solutions.

00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:55.260
So first thing you
can just guess.

00:26:55.260 --> 00:26:58.200
So what do you think what these
three solutions should mean?

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:03.710
If you believe this,
duality has to be true.

00:27:06.250 --> 00:27:07.700
Yes, so that the
game we play here

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:12.810
is that you believe that
the duality is always true.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.310
And then whenever you see some
phenomenon, the gravity side,

00:27:15.310 --> 00:27:16.700
you say this, I
try to integrate.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:19.000
I try to understand on
the field theory side.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:22.690
And it makes sense and then
we just carry out the guess

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.105
and check it, et cetera.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.430
So what would the
three solution mean?

00:27:30.430 --> 00:27:37.430
Three gravity solutions, or
in principle for example,

00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:40.835
for a temperature at here
we can have three solutions

00:27:40.835 --> 00:27:42.085
all have the same temperature.

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:48.390
What would this mean?

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:56.120
So the simplest guess
is that it tells you

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:05.470
that for CFT and the ST
minus y at this temperature

00:28:05.470 --> 00:28:06.755
there's three possible phases.

00:28:14.365 --> 00:28:15.615
There's three possible phases.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:22.800
It's just like
water, ice, or vapor.

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:29.800
There's three possible phases.

00:28:38.125 --> 00:28:39.500
Now, the interpretation
is clear.

00:28:41.888 --> 00:28:42.929
Then we should just find.

00:28:49.290 --> 00:28:51.640
So to decide what is
the right solution then

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.750
we should find what?

00:28:55.900 --> 00:28:58.140
That's right, we
should find the phase,

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:03.709
find the one with the
lowest free energy.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.330
And then to decide which
is the right one then

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:24.760
we just need to find the one
with the lowest free energy.

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:37.325
So now recall that the partition
function the field theory

00:29:37.325 --> 00:29:40.167
side should always be
identified with the partition

00:29:40.167 --> 00:29:41.375
function on the gravity side.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:49.670
And then this side the
partition function by definition

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.510
is minus beta, the free energy.

00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:08.449
[? Seems ?] like
going more and more.

00:30:08.449 --> 00:30:08.990
that's weird.

00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.860
But on the gravity
side we write this

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.460
by saddle-point approximation.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.340
We integrate over
all possible field

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:26.980
on the gravity side weighted
by the euclidean action,

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:32.250
and the leading order in the
saddle-point approximation

00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:33.560
you just evaluate it.

00:30:46.350 --> 00:30:49.245
You just evaluate it on
the classical solutions.

00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:58.190
So now you can just equate them.

00:30:58.190 --> 00:31:00.590
You just need the
free energy must

00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:09.590
be equal to se to
the to the [? Ic. ?]

00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:12.830
So this is just the same
principle we discussed before

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:14.000
on how we just apply it.

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.860
So now if we believe
the duality and we

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:24.470
believe with some of
the [? lamicks ?] then

00:31:24.470 --> 00:31:44.132
we should just find the
solution with now just SE.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.600
So we should calculate the
euclidean action for all three

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:53.150
solutions and then we find
the corresponding free energy

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:57.810
for each of them, and then
the one with the largest, SE,

00:31:57.810 --> 00:32:00.590
will correspond to the one
with lowest free energy.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:02.380
Then that will be
the stable solution.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:08.550
And the other phases presumably
will be unstable or not stable.

00:32:08.550 --> 00:32:09.910
just like in the standard story.

00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:19.940
So this conclusion was drawn
from some of the [? lamrick ?]

00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:21.930
itself.

00:32:21.930 --> 00:32:24.370
But what will be nice we can
actually draw this conclusion

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.760
without using thermal dynamics.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:31.530
So we say, so this
[INAUDIBLE] was

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:34.620
drawn to identify this
with the free energy

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:38.090
and then we say according
to the sum of dynamics,

00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:41.187
and then we should choose the
one with the lowest energy.

00:32:41.187 --> 00:32:42.770
But will be better
if you can actually

00:32:42.770 --> 00:32:47.240
derive this thing
from the gravity side,

00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.950
and you can and for
a very simple reason.

00:32:50.950 --> 00:33:03.150
So this also follows
from the standard rules

00:33:03.150 --> 00:33:17.180
of saddle-point
approximation as follows.

00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.620
Oh, I forgot to
write on this board.

00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:43.200
So when you evaluate
this [? possible ?]

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:47.830
so when you evaluate
your integral

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:51.320
you're in the saddle-point
approximation,

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:55.080
so normally you are instructed
to add the contribution

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.286
of all saddle points.

00:33:57.286 --> 00:33:59.410
So the fact that you have
three different solutions

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:03.270
it tells you have three
separate saddle points.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:06.935
And then just from
the standard rule

00:34:06.935 --> 00:34:08.310
of the saddle-point
approximation

00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:11.370
you just need to add
all of them together.

00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:17.630
So you add the expression SE,
you evaluate the thermal Ads.

00:34:17.630 --> 00:34:20.170
And the expression,
SE you evaluate it

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:26.495
as a big black hole,
and then you add the SE

00:34:26.495 --> 00:34:31.396
to the small black
hole, et cetera.

00:34:31.396 --> 00:34:32.770
OK, you add all
of them together.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:40.980
And now each action
is in exponential.

00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:43.230
And as I said,
they are weighted.

00:34:43.230 --> 00:34:45.350
All this action are
weighted by n square.

00:34:45.350 --> 00:34:48.139
Because the action is
always proponent to law

00:34:48.139 --> 00:34:50.750
of [? Newton ?] and the law of
newton is [? proponent ?] to n

00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:51.553
square.

00:34:51.553 --> 00:34:53.469
So there's a big parameter
in the exponential.

00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:10.660
So the saddle is not just SE
dominates in the large N limit.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.460
You just add three
exponentials, which one

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.640
is the biggest will dominate.

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.170
Because each one of them is
proponent to n square and n

00:35:30.170 --> 00:35:32.700
goes to infinity.

00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:39.240
And n goes infinite means it's
greater than the other guy

00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:41.880
by a tiny bit.

00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:44.640
in the prefactor of n squared
they will become predominant.

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:51.010
So we see that the sum of
the [? lammicks. ?] Sum

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:54.390
of the [? lammicks tells ?] us
we should define the smallest

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:58.730
free energy and then that
statement can be essentially

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:02.770
derived if I don't
know that statement.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:06.140
I can actually derive that
rule, say finding the smallest

00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:09.080
free energy, just by using
the standard saddle-point

00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.740
approximation from
the gravity side.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:16.350
So this is a nice
consistency check.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:19.750
This a nice consistent
check that the duality

00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:23.610
which we believe to be
true should be true.

00:36:23.610 --> 00:36:24.640
Yes?

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:25.910
AUDIENCE: So the one thing
I don't totally understand

00:36:25.910 --> 00:36:27.868
is that, so say that you
give me this Euclidean

00:36:27.868 --> 00:36:33.090
integral over metrics
on the gravity side.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:36.265
So the idea that there's really
only three contributions--

00:36:36.265 --> 00:36:39.060
because we found three solutions
with a particular temperature--

00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:41.451
how do we know that there
aren't any other solutions?

00:36:41.451 --> 00:36:43.700
Like, how do we know there
aren't any other terms that

00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:44.970
were not accounted for?

00:36:44.970 --> 00:36:48.150
PROFESSOR: Oh yeah,
there are three--

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:52.930
so this is a rule of the
saddle-point approximation,

00:36:52.930 --> 00:36:55.670
you find the saddle-point.

00:36:55.670 --> 00:37:00.690
So you find the solution
of the equation of motion

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:03.860
with the right boundary
conditions and these

00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:05.810
are the only ones.

00:37:05.810 --> 00:37:08.244
Yeah, and then of
course, each of them

00:37:08.244 --> 00:37:09.285
include the fluctuations.

00:37:25.062 --> 00:37:27.270
This is just the standard
saddle-point approximation.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:31.160
Any other questions?

00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:36.980
So now the task just
boils down to-- yeah,

00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:39.750
let me just emphasize
here-- yeah,

00:37:39.750 --> 00:37:43.750
so now, the task just
boils down to find

00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:46.710
what is the lowest free energy.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:47.210
OK?

00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:55.510
So now it's 3-- no, it's 4.

00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.930
So now, let's try to decide
which one is more stable.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:10.670
So first, let me just emphasize
SE is proportional to the 1

00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:13.220
Newton-- 1/G Newton.

00:38:13.220 --> 00:38:16.550
And then it's always
proportional to N squared.

00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:17.120
OK?

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.700
Because 1/G Newton is
proportional to N squared

00:38:19.700 --> 00:38:22.820
if you translate from
the [INAUDIBLE] language.

00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.020
And now, if you vary the
free energy for them--

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.720
for this-- here let me call
this-- thermal [? gas and ?]

00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:36.430
AdS, I always just call
it TAdS, OK, Thermal AdS.

00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:42.200
I think, yeah, just-- the
shorthand is just thermal AdS.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:52.080
So for the thermal AdS,
this is actually 0.

00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.015
This is actually 0.

00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.290
So thermal AdS is the free
energy-- I should say this way.

00:39:00.290 --> 00:39:04.860
SE is actually the
0 times N squared.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:06.650
And then you can have
fluctuations then

00:39:06.650 --> 00:39:09.620
that can contribute to the
order and to the power 0

00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:12.030
[? contribution ?].

00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:15.915
So the 0 in this-- 0 is simple.

00:39:15.915 --> 00:39:22.860
It is because, when we go
from the [? pure ?] AdS

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:25.890
into the thermal
AdS, essentially

00:39:25.890 --> 00:39:28.920
we just changing the
global structure.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:29.910
OK?

00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:34.840
We just make the Euclidean
circle so for the pure AdS,

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:39.600
when you go to Euclidean space,
the tau have infinite size.

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:41.490
And then when you go
to the thermal AdS,

00:39:41.490 --> 00:39:44.330
we just make the tau
to be a compact circle.

00:39:44.330 --> 00:39:48.200
So you have not changed the--
the solution is identical.

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:51.170
The solution is identical
go to the pure AdS.

00:39:51.170 --> 00:39:59.620
Just the global structure
is different in terms

00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:04.660
of the periodicity of the
Euclidean time circle.

00:40:04.660 --> 00:40:07.590
So now, if you vary
the classical action--

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:10.260
so if you're reference
point is that the pure AdS,

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.160
the classical action is 0.

00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:15.910
And then, for the
thermal AdS will be 0.

00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:17.032
OK?

00:40:17.032 --> 00:40:17.740
Will be the same.

00:40:17.740 --> 00:40:19.800
It would be the same--
the classical action will

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:24.020
be the same as pure AdS, OK?

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:29.400
So [INAUDIBLE] order N
squared, but then you

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.025
can have fluctuations
which contribute.

00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:41.170
And the fluctuations
is to the-- yeah,

00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:42.920
so the fluctuations
can be interpreted

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:49.230
as the, say, the graviton
symbol [? and ?] division

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:52.410
from the symbol, graviton gas.

00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:53.620
OK?

00:40:53.620 --> 00:41:01.460
And so, say, in the
themal AdS sites

00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:03.790
essentially, have a
thermal gas graviton.

00:41:03.790 --> 00:41:07.350
And there, free energy
is independent of N

00:41:07.350 --> 00:41:09.690
because they are
the fluctuations.

00:41:09.690 --> 00:41:11.310
And just as usual,
whenever you can

00:41:11.310 --> 00:41:13.130
see that the fluctuations
there, they're

00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:20.100
independent of a
coupling constant.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.110
Is this clear?

00:41:21.110 --> 00:41:23.450
AUDIENCE: Why is
the first term 0?

00:41:23.450 --> 00:41:24.296
PROFESSOR: Hm?

00:41:24.296 --> 00:41:25.990
AUDIENCE: Why is
the first term 0?

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:27.781
PROFESSOR: The first
term is 0 because this

00:41:27.781 --> 00:41:30.995
has the same classical
solution as the pure AdS.

00:41:30.995 --> 00:41:35.162
AUDIENCE: The pure AdS, then,
has a nonzero [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:39.812
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:41:39.812 --> 00:41:41.390
Yeah, that's a
very good question.

00:41:41.390 --> 00:41:42.500
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:43.620
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:44.969
I will-- yeah.

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:45.760
Wait a few minutes.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.766
I will talk about
this more precisely.

00:41:47.766 --> 00:41:48.640
It's a good question.

00:41:48.640 --> 00:41:49.130
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:49.796
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.030
Let me just tell you
the answer first,

00:41:55.030 --> 00:41:58.210
and then I will
say a few things.

00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.760
Any other questions?

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.480
OK.

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.700
And then if you calculated
the Euclidean action

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:14.490
for the big black hole
and the small black hole,

00:42:14.490 --> 00:42:17.330
you find that they are
always greater than that.

00:42:17.330 --> 00:42:20.800
It's always larger than action
for the small black hole.

00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:29.640
And this is some number, nonzero
number, times order N squared.

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:34.540
So this is always the case.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:42.390
We also [INAUDIBLE] way for you
to calculate in a few minutes.

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:46.360
But I will not do this
explicit calculation here

00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.130
because it takes some time.

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.030
So there is a simple
way, physical way,

00:42:51.030 --> 00:42:54.380
to understand this-- to
understand why this is true

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.370
because this is a free energy.

00:42:56.370 --> 00:43:00.470
So this tells that the free
energy of the big black hole

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:02.990
is always much more-- is always
smaller than the free energy

00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:04.030
of the small black hole.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.680
This is not a precise
way to understand it,

00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:13.280
but it is a heuristic way-- is
that if you look at these two

00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.450
solutions-- so these
two solutions have

00:43:16.450 --> 00:43:19.360
the same temperature,
but the big black hole

00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:21.300
have a larger size.

00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:25.070
When you have a larger
size and the entropy

00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:27.710
is proportional to the
area of the horizon--

00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:31.165
and the entropy is much
higher, so the big black hole

00:43:31.165 --> 00:43:35.110
has much higher entropy
than the small black hole.

00:43:35.110 --> 00:43:38.960
And so you choose-- you
would expect that this should

00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.650
have a smaller free energy.

00:43:40.650 --> 00:43:43.550
But, of course, you have
to do a precise calculation

00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:47.130
to really check it because
their energy is not the same.

00:43:47.130 --> 00:43:50.000
Their energy is
also not the same.

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.280
Yeah, but this is a
heuristic way to understand.

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:54.092
Anyway, so you find
that the free energy--

00:43:54.092 --> 00:43:56.300
so you find the Euclidean
action, or the [INAUDIBLE],

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.410
is always much--
is always greater

00:43:58.410 --> 00:44:00.510
than the small black hole.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:02.670
And that is good.

00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:04.200
That is good because
that tells you

00:44:04.200 --> 00:44:07.210
the small back hole
is never dominate

00:44:07.210 --> 00:44:10.330
because you always find
something bigger than that.

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:13.400
And the small black hole have
a [? lack of ?] specific heat.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:15.740
That's not something you
want because our Field

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.570
Theory definitely have
quality of specific heat.

00:44:18.570 --> 00:44:21.550
Our Field Theory definitely
has quality of specific heat.

00:44:21.550 --> 00:44:23.990
So that tells you
that this is never--

00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:25.910
can be low-- that would
be a dominate phase.

00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:39.735
So now, if you
calculated a number--

00:44:39.735 --> 00:44:41.610
so now if you look at
the number explicitly--

00:44:53.560 --> 00:45:00.680
So what you'd find actually--
so you also have-- let me just

00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:04.030
first tell you the results, OK?

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:09.736
You find there exists
a temperature, Tc,

00:45:09.736 --> 00:45:12.785
which is greater than
the minimal temperature.

00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.890
Then, you find that the-- when
you're smaller than the minimal

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:20.431
temperature--

00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:36.830
Yeah.

00:45:36.830 --> 00:45:39.115
Right.

00:45:39.115 --> 00:45:39.615
OK.

00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:49.270
So when your T is smaller
than the minimal temperature--

00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.770
oh, no.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:50.930
No.

00:45:50.930 --> 00:45:53.464
T is smaller than Tc.

00:45:53.464 --> 00:45:55.630
So you find that there
exists a Tc, which is greater

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.840
than the minimal temperature.

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:03.440
So let me just say this.

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:08.090
So when T is smaller than
T minimum, of course,

00:46:08.090 --> 00:46:12.887
there's only thermal AdS exists.

00:46:12.887 --> 00:46:14.720
And, of course, that
would be the only phase

00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.850
which can describe the
Field Theory result.

00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:22.430
But, now, there exists another
temperature [? then, ?]

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:26.080
within T, smaller than--
greater than T minimum

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.235
and smaller than Tc.

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:37.700
Then, you find that the SE big
black hole is smaller than 0.

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:42.560
And the thermal
AdS, essentially,

00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.310
by definition to be 0.

00:46:45.310 --> 00:46:46.850
So that means that
the thermal AdS

00:46:46.850 --> 00:46:50.170
will have lower free energy.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:52.220
So in this range, the
thermal AdS will dominate.

00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:09.550
And when T is greater
than Tc, then you

00:47:09.550 --> 00:47:16.947
find that the big black hole
now has a positive action

00:47:16.947 --> 00:47:18.030
and [INAUDIBLE] dominates.

00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:36.902
So if I draw this--
and then there's a Tc

00:47:36.902 --> 00:47:43.920
and there's a T minimum-- so
this is the temperature axis.

00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.590
So here, of course, you
only have a thermal AdS.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:53.700
But within this
range, the thermal AdS

00:47:53.700 --> 00:48:04.020
dominates over big black hole
and the small black hole.

00:48:07.550 --> 00:48:10.873
And when you're above, then
the big black hole dominates.

00:48:15.510 --> 00:48:19.950
So you actually have
a transition at Tc.

00:48:19.950 --> 00:48:22.185
So below here, it's
just thermal AdS.

00:48:22.185 --> 00:48:34.910
And then you have a
transition from thermal AdS

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:38.340
to the big black hole at Tc.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:01.720
So a quick side remark.

00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:04.795
How we-- how would
you find this result?

00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:18.144
So this would be the result
if you calculated the-- so

00:49:18.144 --> 00:49:19.810
you just calculate
the Euclidean action.

00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:20.540
You compare them.

00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:21.665
That's what you would find.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.080
So any questions about that?

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:34.580
Yes?

00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:36.746
AUDIENCE: Do you ever get
the small black hole phase

00:49:36.746 --> 00:49:40.080
at all somehow artificially?

00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.185
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can
always get artificially.

00:49:43.185 --> 00:49:44.490
Yeah, artificially, always.

00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:45.330
Yeah.

00:49:45.330 --> 00:49:48.840
And let me not go into that.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:53.690
So now, let me just say a few
remarks, say, in finding SE.

00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:06.237
So when you find the
Euclidean action,

00:50:06.237 --> 00:50:07.570
you find it is always divergent.

00:50:10.330 --> 00:50:13.954
It's the same thing as
what we encountered before.

00:50:13.954 --> 00:50:15.370
If you calculate
the whole action,

00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:17.494
you have to integrate the--
over the-- essentially,

00:50:17.494 --> 00:50:19.880
the volume of the AdS.

00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:21.850
But the volume of
AdS goes to infinity

00:50:21.850 --> 00:50:23.950
at-- near the
boundary, essentially,

00:50:23.950 --> 00:50:25.932
you always get infinity.

00:50:25.932 --> 00:50:27.640
So in order to get a
[? finite ?] answer,

00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.681
you need renormalization.

00:50:38.900 --> 00:50:41.540
So when you do renormalization,
essentially, you

00:50:41.540 --> 00:50:45.200
put the [? cut ?] off and
then you subtract covariant,

00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:46.200
the local counter terms.

00:50:58.162 --> 00:50:58.870
You put a cutoff.

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:10.566
And then you subtract covariant
counter terms at the cutoff.

00:51:10.566 --> 00:51:11.940
And then you get
a finite answer.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.880
Then, you take the
cutoff to the boundary.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:19.470
So we will not go
through this procedure,

00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:22.840
but it's something you can do.

00:51:22.840 --> 00:51:24.870
But there's an
alternative shortcut

00:51:24.870 --> 00:51:28.090
to not go through these.

00:51:28.090 --> 00:51:34.540
Or you can just subtract-- just
calculate the Euclidean action

00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:40.550
for the cutoff, then subtract
the value of pure AdS.

00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:47.920
So if you calculate
the pure AdS,

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:50.780
you will find the answer
is also divergent.

00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.080
You will find the answer
is also divergent.

00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:56.010
And you just subtract it.

00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:57.430
And then when you
do the subtract,

00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:01.980
you will find the
difference is [? finite. ?]

00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.870
And then you find the
difference is finite.

00:52:04.870 --> 00:52:08.180
And this is a slightly
simple way to do than that,

00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:10.860
but we also not do this
because, still, you

00:52:10.860 --> 00:52:14.780
have to calculate Euclidean
action [? and such. ?]

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:27.060
So the synchron-- shortcut is
to assume thermal dynamics.

00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:29.390
That's what we did last time.

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:32.480
Because you can find the
entropy density very easy.

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:36.400
So entropy density--
did I erase my--

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.340
so the entropy density
is just, essentially,

00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:41.024
the area of the horizon.

00:52:41.024 --> 00:52:43.690
So the entropy-- right now, it's
actually the total entropy, not

00:52:43.690 --> 00:52:46.064
the entropy density because
now we are [? almost here. ?]

00:52:46.064 --> 00:52:49.960
So the entropy would be--
and size of the sphere

00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:55.250
will be r0 to the power d
minus 1 times omega d minus 1.

00:52:55.250 --> 00:53:00.540
Omega is the volume
of a unit sphere.

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.569
And then divided by 4 pi 4GN.

00:53:03.569 --> 00:53:05.110
So this is the
entropy of the system.

00:53:07.930 --> 00:53:12.040
And you can express this
in terms of the temperature

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:13.991
because r0 is a
function of temperature.

00:53:17.290 --> 00:53:18.640
r0 is a function of temperature.

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.250
If you invert this,
you can imagine r0

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:22.710
is a function of temperature.

00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:24.460
So you have-- essentially
you have entropy

00:53:24.460 --> 00:53:27.720
as a function of temperature.

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.600
And-- Hm?

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:32.420
AUDIENCE: d minus
1, what's that?

00:53:32.420 --> 00:53:33.992
PROFESSOR:
[? Formula ?] d minus 1

00:53:33.992 --> 00:53:35.530
is the volume of
the unit sphere.

00:53:49.490 --> 00:53:50.660
So you know the entropy.

00:53:50.660 --> 00:53:56.100
You can just use the formula
S equal to minus F minus T

00:53:56.100 --> 00:54:03.850
divided by T to--
so you can also

00:54:03.850 --> 00:54:09.220
write this as minus F r0,
partial r0, partial T,

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.250
et cetera.

00:54:11.250 --> 00:54:14.140
And then you can
integrate this equation

00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:17.930
to find the-- to find
F as a function of r0

00:54:17.930 --> 00:54:23.270
because we know how the
r0 depends on T from here.

00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:26.070
So you just need to
integrate this equation.

00:54:26.070 --> 00:54:28.990
So this is a simple
exercise because now

00:54:28.990 --> 00:54:33.540
you just need to do an
integral of some function.

00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:39.670
And then you find omega
d minus 1 divided by 16

00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:47.570
pi GN, r0 d minus 2 minus
r0 d divided by R squared.

00:54:50.321 --> 00:54:51.945
You get actually a
rather simple answer

00:54:51.945 --> 00:54:53.070
if you do that integration.

00:54:56.716 --> 00:54:58.590
So we have chosen the
integration constant so

00:54:58.590 --> 00:55:00.350
that when r0 equals
to 0, this is

00:55:00.350 --> 00:55:03.455
0 because r0 equal to
0, if the black hole has

00:55:03.455 --> 00:55:06.450
0 size, essentially,
[? there's ?] no black hole.

00:55:06.450 --> 00:55:08.740
And then we have
chosen the free energy

00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:13.780
to be 0 for the
[? no ?] black hole.

00:55:13.780 --> 00:55:15.570
So this free energy,
again, should

00:55:15.570 --> 00:55:18.010
be interpreted as the
difference with the pure AdS.

00:55:21.850 --> 00:55:28.130
So for the black hole-- this
is the black hole free energy

00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:30.570
because, by definition,
this way, the pure AdS,

00:55:30.570 --> 00:55:31.380
you just have 0.

00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:38.150
Any questions about this?

00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:42.970
So now you see here,
clearly, this expression.

00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:44.460
So now this is a
free energy now.

00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:47.200
This is not the
Euclidean action.

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:52.280
So they differ by the
amount [? assigned ?]

00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:53.340
in my convention.

00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:01.010
So now you see that there
exists r0, critical r0.

00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:14.240
F black hole is greater than
0 Free energy is greater

00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:26.990
than 0 for r0 is smaller than R.

00:56:26.990 --> 00:56:31.520
So you can write it as formula d
minus 1-- so let me just write.

00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:38.000
Yeah, you can put the omega--
the r0 to that [? out ?]

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.420
for the overall factor r0.

00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:43.440
Yeah, put d minus 2
out, and this just

00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:47.150
becomes 1 minus r0 squared.

00:56:50.970 --> 00:56:53.200
So you find that the free
energy is greater than 0.

00:56:53.200 --> 00:56:54.780
But r0 is greater than 1.

00:56:54.780 --> 00:57:01.170
That's greater
than the-- so this

00:57:01.170 --> 00:57:05.470
is greater than the
value of the thermal AdS.

00:57:05.470 --> 00:57:09.220
And the black hole
is smaller than 0.

00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:16.200
The free energy [? smaller ?]
than 0 become great than R.

00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.478
So the r0 is somewhere here.

00:57:19.478 --> 00:57:20.960
So r0 is somewhere here.

00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:24.881
It has to exist above
the-- it's somewhere here.

00:57:24.881 --> 00:57:28.120
This is r0.

00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:33.490
This is this r0 critical
[? as you go ?] to R.

00:57:33.490 --> 00:57:38.890
This is r0 critical
[? as you go ?] to R,

00:57:38.890 --> 00:57:41.500
somewhere here.

00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.920
So it's always a big black hole.

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:53.600
And you can find out what is
this critical temperature.

00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:58.120
So the critical temperature is
just the beta evaluate at r0

00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:02.670
equal to R. And then
you can find out

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:06.460
that this is 2 pi R
divided by d minus 1.

00:58:06.460 --> 00:58:09.675
Just using this formula
you can find out it's that.

00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:22.785
So now I emphasize that
this is a phase transition.

00:58:25.330 --> 00:58:27.110
And this is not only
a phase transition,

00:58:27.110 --> 00:58:30.770
this is actually a first
order phase transition

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:34.070
for the following reason.

00:58:34.070 --> 00:58:38.510
So in our unit, below
here, the free energy

00:58:38.510 --> 00:58:41.065
is 0 times order N squared.

00:58:41.065 --> 00:58:42.740
It's 0 times N squared.

00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:54.100
But about here-- well,
actually, above Tc-- at Tc,

00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:57.350
the free energy is
exactly equal to 0.

00:58:57.350 --> 00:59:02.814
So [? r0c ?] is
equal to R at Tc.

00:59:02.814 --> 00:59:03.730
There's a free energy.

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:04.780
It's exactly 0.

00:59:04.780 --> 00:59:10.060
So at Tc, the-- a big black
hole and the thermal AdS

00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:11.420
have the same free energy.

00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:14.320
So they can exist together.

00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:20.420
And above here, then the free
energy of the big black hole

00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:24.210
is some negative number times
order-- times N squared.

00:59:28.630 --> 00:59:32.280
So your free energy
has a huge change.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:36.010
So essentially, the first
derivative of free energy,

00:59:36.010 --> 00:59:40.390
is discontinuous across
the phase transition.

00:59:45.509 --> 00:59:47.633
So this is actually a first
order phase transition.

00:59:54.255 --> 00:59:56.510
So this is-- yeah, let
me just emphasize that.

01:00:08.628 --> 01:00:19.490
So this is a first
order phase transition,

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:28.180
with the free energy equal
to order N to the power 0

01:00:28.180 --> 01:00:32.235
when T is smaller than Tc and
some nonzero number times N

01:00:32.235 --> 01:00:32.735
squared.

01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:36.420
Well, T greater than Tc.

01:00:51.507 --> 01:00:52.090
Any questions?

01:01:03.475 --> 01:01:07.930
AUDIENCE: When r0 is equal
to R, then F is equal to 0.

01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:08.920
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.275
AUDIENCE: Then, why is the-- oh.

01:01:12.275 --> 01:01:15.620
PROFESSOR: No, the derivative
of F should be discontinuous.

01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:18.140
No, F is continuous.

01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:22.280
No, this is a definition of
the-- for the phase transition,

01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.550
the free energy is
always continuous.

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:27.910
And then the free-- so the
first derivative here will

01:01:27.910 --> 01:01:29.920
be proportional to N squared.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.570
And you can check-- Yeah?

01:01:31.570 --> 01:01:34.080
AUDIENCE: So the point is-- OK,
so just see if I understand.

01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:36.000
So the point is that
it's discontinuous

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.010
in the limit of
large N or something?

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:38.580
I mean--

01:01:38.580 --> 01:01:39.330
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's right.

01:01:39.330 --> 01:01:39.790
That's right.

01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:40.290
Exactly.

01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:45.250
So let me emphasize.

01:01:45.250 --> 01:01:47.580
So this is N goes
to infinity limit.

01:02:09.957 --> 01:02:11.165
Is there any other questions?

01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:17.320
So we see there's a lot
of [? rich ?] story when

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.210
you go to the sphere.

01:02:20.210 --> 01:02:22.920
And, actually, there's
a phase transition.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.750
And the phase transition
roughly [? adds to-- ?]

01:02:25.750 --> 01:02:29.860
the black hole size
is the AdS radius.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:33.260
Exactly the black hole
size is AdS radius.

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:38.070
And this is, more or less, what
you expected because that's

01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:41.140
where the physics become
nontrivial because when

01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:44.360
the horizon is much, much
smaller than the black hole

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:47.400
[? size-- ?] than the
curvature radius, as I said,

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.361
just should reduce to the flat
space black hole and et cetera.

01:02:52.361 --> 01:02:54.610
Yeah, because the curvature
radius is only scale here.

01:03:00.220 --> 01:03:02.830
So now, let me make
another remark.

01:03:06.510 --> 01:03:07.680
Now, I erase this.

01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:08.360
I think it's OK.

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:14.570
Yeah So you should
actually check yourself.

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:27.840
So below Tc, the F
prime is always 0.

01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:29.690
When you take the
derivative, it's

01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:34.010
always 0 at order N squared.

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:41.250
Let me, again, write this
answer, 0 times N squared.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:49.992
So you should check that
the first derivative of F

01:03:49.992 --> 01:03:50.968
is discontinuous.

01:03:59.264 --> 01:04:01.860
AUDIENCE: So F itself
is not discontinuous?

01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:06.450
PROFESSOR: No, F is not
because the F is 0 precisely

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:08.490
at T equal to Tc.

01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:10.790
So F is equal to 0.

01:04:10.790 --> 01:04:13.490
And the-- Yeah.

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.440
So the reason the first
derivative is discontinuous

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:25.380
is very clear because
below Tc, this is 0.

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:30.460
So the first derivative
is 0 times N squared.

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:33.990
And above Tc, the
derivative is the derivative

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:41.160
of the free energy of the
black hole at I equal to r0.

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:44.040
And, clearly, the
derivative is nonzero.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.250
At I equal to r0, the
derivative is [? nonzero. ?] OK?

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:50.060
And so you see,
they're discontinuous.

01:05:02.050 --> 01:05:09.845
So since physics only depends on
the [? dimensionless ?] number,

01:05:09.845 --> 01:05:29.050
R times T-- So large R,
small T-- large R at fixed T

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:35.194
essentially is the same as
the, say, large T fixed R.

01:05:35.194 --> 01:05:36.860
It can only depend
on the ratio of them.

01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:37.360
OK?

01:05:39.884 --> 01:05:41.300
It depends on the
product of them.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.340
So you can either think
of-- you can either

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:50.410
think you fix the
temperature, you

01:05:50.410 --> 01:05:53.500
increase the size of the sphere.

01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:56.000
Or you fix the
size of the sphere,

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.770
you increase the temperature.

01:05:57.770 --> 01:06:02.070
[? In ?] fact, the same
is to increase this guy.

01:06:02.070 --> 01:06:05.785
And this is essentially the
limit going to the flat space.

01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:13.400
It's going to the R to the T.
If you take R go to infinity,

01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.755
you go to a [? theory ?]
on R d minus 1.

01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:22.370
So we see that the
theory on R d minus 1

01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:29.430
is mapped to the high
temperature limits

01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:30.610
of the theory on the sphere.

01:06:39.199 --> 01:06:40.990
So essentially, just
corresponding to the 1

01:06:40.990 --> 01:06:45.750
point for the
[? theory ?] on the sphere

01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:49.490
and this infinite temperature of
the [? theory ?] on the sphere.

01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:51.010
So that's why, as
we said before,

01:06:51.010 --> 01:06:53.650
because there's no scale here,
the [INAUDIBLE] temperature

01:06:53.650 --> 01:06:56.840
from here is essentially
the same in the flat space.

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:04.750
And in particular, this is
described by a big black hole.

01:07:07.450 --> 01:07:09.250
And this is exactly
what we see before

01:07:09.250 --> 01:07:12.965
because when the black
hole become very big,

01:07:12.965 --> 01:07:14.970
then you can approximate
it to a plane

01:07:14.970 --> 01:07:18.010
because, locally, it's
like a plane [? anymore. ?]

01:07:18.010 --> 01:07:20.310
And the spherical horizon
is just like a plane.

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:22.830
And then you go to
the black plane--

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:27.450
you go to the black hole
with the flat horizon.

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:41.080
AUDIENCE: Why are the phases
only dependent on R times T?

01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:46.280
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
this a CFT and this

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.580
is only dimensions number.

01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:52.180
It can only depend on them
through this dimensions number.

01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:53.300
There is no other scale.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.470
Good?

01:08:00.470 --> 01:08:02.150
Other questions?

01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:03.080
Yes?

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.580
AUDIENCE: So on the
side of the CFT,

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.566
what are the different phases?

01:08:06.566 --> 01:08:07.157
I didn't-

01:08:07.157 --> 01:08:07.865
PROFESSOR: Sorry?

01:08:07.865 --> 01:08:12.380
AUDIENCE: What are the different
phases on the CFT side?

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.861
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's what
we are going to explain.

01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:22.859
So now, we have to describe
the black hole story.

01:08:22.859 --> 01:08:25.399
Or now, we have described
the gravity story.

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:28.120
Just by looking at
the gravity size,

01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:30.750
we saw there are
three possible phases.

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:34.470
At low temperature, you
get this thermal AdS phase.

01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:38.330
At high temperature, you
get big black hole phase,

01:08:38.330 --> 01:08:40.850
and then there is a phase
transition between them.

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:43.670
And then, also, you have
unstable small black hole

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:49.944
phase, which never
appears as a stable phase

01:08:49.944 --> 01:08:50.735
at any temperature.

01:08:54.010 --> 01:08:56.420
So, now, let's try to see
whether we can understand this

01:08:56.420 --> 01:08:57.545
from the Field Theory side.

01:08:57.545 --> 01:08:59.660
What does this mean from
the Field Theory side?

01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:05.474
Why somehow-- if I, for example,
put [INAUDIBLE] on a sphere,

01:09:05.474 --> 01:09:07.859
do I expect such kind
of phase transition?

01:09:07.859 --> 01:09:10.226
Does this make sense?

01:09:10.226 --> 01:09:11.600
Oh, by the way,
I should say this

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.840
is the-- so this is called
a Hawking-Page transition.

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:18.760
So this is called a
Hawking-Page transition.

01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:30.390
So remarkably,
this was discovered

01:09:30.390 --> 01:09:35.850
in 1980-- I think '81
or '82, almost 20 years

01:09:35.850 --> 01:09:37.518
before this AdS/CFT conjecture.

01:09:39.746 --> 01:09:41.370
But they already
figured out that there

01:09:41.370 --> 01:09:43.515
is a phase transition.

01:09:43.515 --> 01:09:45.640
They were-- so they were
looking at the black holes

01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:48.069
[? and ?] AdS, and they said,
oh, there's two black holes.

01:09:48.069 --> 01:09:50.040
But there's also some AdS.

01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.645
And then, somehow,
there's some kind

01:09:51.645 --> 01:09:53.100
of phase transition
between them.

01:09:53.100 --> 01:09:55.317
But because they don't
know the Field Theory,

01:09:55.317 --> 01:09:56.900
they don't know this
should correspond

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.335
into some kind of
Field Theory system.

01:09:59.335 --> 01:10:01.460
But they figured out this
gravity story essentially

01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:04.457
in 1981.

01:10:04.457 --> 01:10:06.540
Now, let's explain what
should be the Field Theory

01:10:06.540 --> 01:10:13.927
interpretation of
this-- The Field Theory

01:10:13.927 --> 01:10:14.760
explanation of this.

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:40.065
Physical reasons for
Hawking-Page transition.

01:10:55.600 --> 01:11:00.600
So now, I will
consider a toy example.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.580
So I won't consider--
so [INAUDIBLE]

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:05.680
on the sphere, that's a
little bit too complicated.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:08.950
But I'm going to
consider toy example.

01:11:08.950 --> 01:11:12.070
And you will see,
from this toy example,

01:11:12.070 --> 01:11:15.655
that the physics behind this is
very simple and actually, also,

01:11:15.655 --> 01:11:16.155
[INAUDIBLE].

01:11:19.390 --> 01:11:25.899
So let's consider you have N
squared harmonic oscillator--

01:11:25.899 --> 01:11:26.940
free harmonic oscillator.

01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:31.720
So let's just
imagine you can take

01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.540
them to be different
frequencies-- [? let's ?] just

01:11:33.540 --> 01:11:35.725
even for simplicity-- or
for the same frequency.

01:11:45.230 --> 01:11:48.040
Say, omega-- I have some omega,
which I just take to be 1.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:48.876
Doesn't matter.

01:11:52.260 --> 01:11:54.520
So just consider N squared
free harmonic oscillator.

01:11:57.710 --> 01:12:02.240
So I claim when N-- when
N goes infinite limit,

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:04.530
this system have the
same phase transition--

01:12:04.530 --> 01:12:07.000
have exactly the same phase
transition described there.

01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:12.490
So, now, I will explain.

01:12:12.490 --> 01:12:14.450
So first, let's
look just at-- this

01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:16.700
is a system we know how
to solve exactly, so let's

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.570
look at the spectrum.

01:12:18.570 --> 01:12:22.140
So this is total spectrum, the
total energy spectrum of this N

01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.880
squared harmonic oscillators.

01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.800
So let's call the
0, the ground state.

01:12:30.150 --> 01:12:32.870
So let me normalize the
energy so that the ground

01:12:32.870 --> 01:12:35.990
state have energy 0.

01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:39.580
And then you can excite
one harmonic oscillator,

01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:41.200
and then you have state of 1.

01:12:48.411 --> 01:12:48.910
Yeah.

01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:53.980
Actually-- Yeah,
have state of 1.

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:56.660
And you can have two harmonic
, oscillator et cetera.

01:13:01.204 --> 01:13:03.370
And then you'll have many
harmonic oscillators, say,

01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:07.400
of all-- then, you're going
to have almost every harmonic

01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:08.710
oscillator excited.

01:13:08.710 --> 01:13:11.580
And then you have energy of
order N squared, et cetera.

01:13:21.410 --> 01:13:26.835
So now you have to imagine a
slightly nontrivial condition.

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:29.210
Now, you have to imagine a
slightly nontrivial condition,

01:13:29.210 --> 01:13:30.876
which this is the
only thing [? reach ?]

01:13:30.876 --> 01:13:32.190
beyond the harmonic oscillator.

01:13:42.350 --> 01:13:42.850
Yeah.

01:13:42.850 --> 01:13:49.390
Actually, I just realized this.

01:13:53.570 --> 01:13:55.635
I slightly oversimplified
the story a little bit.

01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:04.090
Yeah.

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:08.340
Yeah, let me say this way.

01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:10.070
Yeah.

01:14:10.070 --> 01:14:10.570
Yeah.

01:14:10.570 --> 01:14:14.290
Let's consider 2N
harmonic oscillators.

01:14:14.290 --> 01:14:18.950
So let me arrange it
into two matrix, A and B.

01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:20.820
And they are all free.
it doesn't matter.

01:14:20.820 --> 01:14:23.319
For this purpose, it doesn't
matter how many harmonic-- just

01:14:23.319 --> 01:14:27.080
imagine I have arranged
them into two matrices,

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.630
so I have two N squared
harmonic oscillators.

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:33.010
And then I can excite them.

01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.830
But, now, I have a condition.

01:14:35.830 --> 01:14:39.620
So I have a condition, which
is analog to the condition

01:14:39.620 --> 01:14:42.010
of the gauge invariance.

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:45.750
Instead, I want all
the states to be

01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:51.950
the trace singlet
created by A and B.

01:14:51.950 --> 01:14:54.080
You have A, B, et cetera.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:57.580
So A have N squared creation
and annihilation operator,

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.080
and B have N squared
annihilation-- creation

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:03.660
and annihilation operator.

01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:05.930
And then you can
act them-- then,

01:15:05.930 --> 01:15:09.590
you can [? accurately ?]
form the spectrum that it is.

01:15:09.590 --> 01:15:12.600
But there's a-- but also I
need to add a gauge invariance

01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.100
condition.

01:15:18.860 --> 01:15:24.860
It's that the state
[? acted ?] by A and B

01:15:24.860 --> 01:15:27.400
have to be SU(N) singlet.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.960
And SU(N) is the conjugate.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:37.780
Just imagine A and b
transformed under some SU(N)

01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:40.820
[? join representation. ?]
And they

01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:44.520
have to be the SU(N) singlet.

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.350
So equivalent statement say that
the trace A and B-- the order

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:53.210
state has to be
created by operators

01:15:53.210 --> 01:15:57.170
inside the trace, single trace
or multiple traces, et cetera.

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:00.695
So is this clear?

01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:07.370
AUDIENCE: So one thing.

01:16:07.370 --> 01:16:09.385
So A and B are operators?

01:16:09.385 --> 01:16:09.965
Or they are--

01:16:09.965 --> 01:16:12.090
PROFESSOR: They're operators,
harmonic oscillators.

01:16:12.090 --> 01:16:12.570
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

01:16:12.570 --> 01:16:13.236
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:16:13.236 --> 01:16:17.540
Imagine you have two
matrices under-- and two

01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:20.730
harmonic oscillators
that form two matrices.

01:16:20.730 --> 01:16:26.140
And each of them have N
squared harmonic oscillator.

01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:28.350
And if I just say they
are free, then you

01:16:28.350 --> 01:16:31.009
don't even have to think
about the matrix structure.

01:16:31.009 --> 01:16:33.550
AUDIENCE: So the only thing,
I'm confused about the matrices.

01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:37.295
So are the matrices acting on
some [INAUDIBLE] So in other

01:16:37.295 --> 01:16:38.304
words--

01:16:38.304 --> 01:16:38.970
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

01:16:38.970 --> 01:16:40.910
Let me be a little
bit more explicit.

01:16:43.630 --> 01:16:45.990
[INAUDIBLE] Think about
the foreign system.

01:16:49.570 --> 01:16:56.530
The Lagrangian 1/2 Tr
A dot squared, Tr 1/2,

01:16:56.530 --> 01:17:07.160
Tr B dot squared minus 1/2
Tr A square 1/2 Tr B squared.

01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.150
So this is a free
harmonic oscillator.

01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:12.460
So these are two N squared
free harmonic oscillators

01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.460
with frequency 1.

01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:19.687
So if I don't impose
this singlet condition,

01:17:19.687 --> 01:17:21.645
this is just a purely
free harmonic oscillator.

01:17:26.650 --> 01:17:28.500
But now, I [? require ?]
all the state--

01:17:28.500 --> 01:17:34.960
and so SU(N) transformation--
[? yeah, you can act them. ?]

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:38.890
But now, I impose the
condition that they will have--

01:17:38.890 --> 01:17:42.030
they should be SU(N) singlets.

01:17:42.030 --> 01:17:44.540
So they can [? create ?]
it by A and B, et cetera.

01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:47.598
But they should
be SU(N) singlet.

01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:54.120
Good?

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:58.040
So now one thing
you can convince

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:06.170
yourself is that because
of the trace condition--

01:18:06.170 --> 01:18:09.290
so if you think about the
state of energy 1 or 2,

01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:15.520
et cetera-- so as far as the
energy is order N to the power

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:21.970
0, so as far as the energy
does not scale with N,

01:18:21.970 --> 01:18:25.460
you can check yourself the
density of state-- the way

01:18:25.460 --> 01:18:28.320
you can-- the degeneracy
of those states

01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:34.050
will always be of
order N to the power 0.

01:18:34.050 --> 01:18:37.062
So this is a fact.

01:18:37.062 --> 01:18:38.145
You can convince yourself.

01:18:56.270 --> 01:19:01.800
And when you go to the
energy of order N squared,

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.220
then you can check that
the density of state

01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:06.400
become exponential
of order N squared.

01:19:19.030 --> 01:19:22.704
So the reason for
this is very simple.

01:19:22.704 --> 01:19:24.870
So the reason for this is
very simple heuristically.

01:19:30.150 --> 01:19:33.330
So the reason for
this is very simple

01:19:33.330 --> 01:19:35.710
because if you have a state
of order 1, which does not

01:19:35.710 --> 01:19:41.750
scale with N, means there's
only order 1 states-- order

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:43.390
1 oscillators are excited.

01:19:47.802 --> 01:19:49.510
And then, of course,
the density of state

01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:53.640
will be independent of N. And
if you do have energy of order

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.670
N squared because each
of-- each oscillator

01:19:56.670 --> 01:20:00.520
has a frequency of 1, and then
you have energy N squared.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:04.100
And then that means order N
squared oscillator is excited.

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:08.400
And then you have order Ns--
if you have order N squared

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.910
oscillator excited, then how
many ways you can choose them

01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:14.691
to construct the [? state of ?]
energy order N square and that

01:20:14.691 --> 01:20:16.232
[? exponential ?]
of order N squared.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.190
So imagine each
of the states, you

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:33.290
can have N possible oscillator
to act, say, for each of them

01:20:33.290 --> 01:20:35.200
for twice.

01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.330
Then, you have 2 to
the order N squared

01:20:37.330 --> 01:20:40.170
probabilities of doing that.

01:20:40.170 --> 01:20:42.260
So that's where this
[? exponential ?] order

01:20:42.260 --> 01:20:43.640
N squared come out.

01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:44.390
So this is a fact.

01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:46.040
You should try to
convince yourself

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:49.980
if it's not obvious to you now.

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:53.840
So the reason I add this
singlet condition is for here.

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.150
If I don't add a
singlet condition,

01:20:56.150 --> 01:20:59.220
then there's some
kind of independence

01:20:59.220 --> 01:21:01.370
here, which I don't want.

01:21:01.370 --> 01:21:03.460
There can be [? log ?]
independence.

01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:05.040
Yeah, just-- yeah.

01:21:05.040 --> 01:21:08.940
So this makes [? your ?] story
a little bit [? convenient. ?]

01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:15.640
Oh, so now-- yeah.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:19.440
We're running out of
time unfortunately.

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:25.000
So now let's consider
the free energy,

01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:26.960
which, roughly, you can
consider as integrates

01:21:26.960 --> 01:21:32.500
of all possible states with
this weight factor and times

01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.380
the density of state.

01:21:37.472 --> 01:21:38.930
[INAUDIBLE] because
the free energy

01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:45.080
sum of all states,
minus BH, and the sum

01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:48.040
translated into the integral
with a density of states.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:51.950
And then that
translates into that.

01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:59.300
So naively-- so we
always consider--

01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:04.087
so our beta is always-- does not
scale with N. That's order 1.

01:22:04.087 --> 01:22:04.920
It's always order 1.

01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:20.880
So if you look at here
naively, only state

01:22:20.880 --> 01:22:23.880
of energy of order
that's not scale N

01:22:23.880 --> 01:22:34.550
will contribute significantly
because of this suppression.

01:22:38.930 --> 01:22:41.220
Because of the thermal
suppression, say,

01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:43.110
if you have energy
of state of order

01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:46.785
N squared, then this
is a huge suppression.

01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:50.720
Then, they should
not contribute.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:53.270
Then, they should not make
a visible expression--

01:22:53.270 --> 01:22:58.840
a contribution to
your free energy.

01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:04.565
Expect, except when those states
have a huge density of states.

01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:14.440
So except when those states
have a huge density of states.

01:23:14.440 --> 01:23:19.690
So, here, we see those
states have actually

01:23:19.690 --> 01:23:21.232
order N squared
density of states.

01:23:25.170 --> 01:23:32.480
So that means, in here, in that
integral, you have beta times

01:23:32.480 --> 01:23:36.910
order N squared-- something of
order N squared and then times

01:23:36.910 --> 01:23:41.710
something positive
of order N squared.

01:23:41.710 --> 01:23:44.330
When you can see the
contribution of the state

01:23:44.330 --> 01:23:46.740
of energy of order N squared.

01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:51.390
So when this factor
dominate over this factor,

01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:54.580
then the entropy will overwhelm
the thermal suppression.

01:23:54.580 --> 01:23:56.200
And then, such
state will dominate.

01:23:59.690 --> 01:24:02.770
And that precisely happens
when beta becomes small enough.

01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:04.855
Because when beta
becomes small enough,

01:24:04.855 --> 01:24:06.480
when you got the high
temperature, then

01:24:06.480 --> 01:24:08.200
beta decrease.

01:24:08.200 --> 01:24:10.570
So eventually, this
will overwhelm this one

01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:12.301
because the beta will decrease.

01:24:12.301 --> 01:24:14.300
And that's precisely the
Hawking-Page transition

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.960
we'll see.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:23.290
So at low beta-- at big
beta or small temperature,

01:24:23.290 --> 01:24:24.870
thermal-- this one dominates.

01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:34.970
And then, the [? V ?] would
be of order N to the power 0

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:37.947
because only state of
order-- energy order zero

01:24:37.947 --> 01:24:38.613
will contribute.

01:24:41.490 --> 01:24:53.290
But the beta-- when beta
is sufficiently small, then

01:24:53.290 --> 01:24:58.995
the [? log ?] D(E) minus BE
can become greater than 0.

01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.115
And then the order N squared
states will dominate.|

01:25:10.510 --> 01:25:12.265
And then you find
the-- then, you find

01:25:12.265 --> 01:25:14.890
the [? partial function ?] will
be [? exponential ?] of order N

01:25:14.890 --> 01:25:15.390
squared.

01:25:18.480 --> 01:25:23.710
And that's precisely what we see
in the Hawking-Page transition.

01:25:23.710 --> 01:25:26.010
So I emphasize that
physics here have

01:25:26.010 --> 01:25:30.150
nothing to do with the
details of the system,

01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:34.610
only related to the large N
and to the density of states.

01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:38.030
So if you have interactions,
if you have more complicated

01:25:38.030 --> 01:25:39.920
system, it doesn't matter.

01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:40.670
It doesn't matter.

01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:45.340
As far as your [INAUDIBLE],
this phenomenon will happen.

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:48.080
This phenomenon will happen.

01:25:48.080 --> 01:25:52.070
And so this is the essence of
the Hawking-Page transition.

01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:53.748
We will stop here.

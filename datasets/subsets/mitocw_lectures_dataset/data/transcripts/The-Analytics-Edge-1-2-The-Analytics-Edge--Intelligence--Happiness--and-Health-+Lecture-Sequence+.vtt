00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.840
Our first example today
is a story of IBM Watson.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.370
IBM research, a distinguished
industrial laboratory,

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.350
strives to push the
limits of science.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.360
In the mid-1990s it created
Deep Blue, a computer that

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.060
beat Garry Kasparov, the world
champion in Chess at the time,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.180
showing to the world that
machines can beat humans

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.960
in tasks that
people thought were

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.120
restricted to
human intelligence.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.130
In the 1990s-- in
the late 1990s--

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.720
it created Blue Gene, a computer
to map the human genome.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.830
In 2005 IBM decided to
create a computer that

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.000
would compete at Jeopardy,
a popular game show.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.620
From the T.J. Watson
Research Center

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.390
in Yorktown Heights,
New York, this

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.110
is Jeopardy-- The IBM Challenge.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.030
Please welcome back
our contestants.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.460
He has never been defeated.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.640
And his winnings of
more than $3.2 million

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.110
make him Jeopardy's all
time biggest money winner.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.300
From Los Angeles, California,
here's Brad Rutter.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.110
An IBM computer system able to
rapidly understand and analyze

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.080
natural language,
including puns, riddles,

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.350
and complex questions across
a broad range of knowledge,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.850
please welcome Watson.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.220
In 2004 he captivated America by
winning 74 consecutive matches

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.570
and $2.5 million on Jeopardy.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.800
From Seattle, Washington,
here's Ken Jennings.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.610
And now here is the host
of Jeopardy, Alex Trebek.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.080
Thank you, Johnny.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.590
Before we get into
the game, there

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.080
are just a couple
of things I need

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.430
to tell you about this match.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.350
Now as I said earlier,
Watson will receive the clues

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.759
electronically as a text file
at the same moment the clues are

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.000
revealed to Ken and Brad.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.070
And at the same
time I read them.

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.660
This competition
will be a two game

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.720
total point exhibition match.

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.670
However, these two games will be
played out over the next three

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.090
days so we can tell
the full story.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.960
Throughout the games you'll
get a glimpse of the thinking

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.200
process, if you will, that
is behind Watson's responses.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.380
Now this will be done through
an answer panel display

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.140
at the bottom of the screen.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.270
Let's play Jeopardy.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.820
Here we go.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.150
Our first round of play
contains these categories--

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.470
Literary Character APB, All
Points Bulletin; Beatles

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.120
People; Olympic Oddities;
Name the Decade;

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.120
Final Frontiers; and
Alternate Meanings.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.090
A little while ago
we had a drawing

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.530
to determine which player
would select first.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.970
Brad, you won that.

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.270
So if you're ready
make your first choice.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.950
Let's take alternate
meanings for $200, Alex.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.040
Four letter word for a
vantage point or a belief.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.620
Brad?

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:17.240
What is a view?

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.760
Yes.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.260
Alternate meanings, $400.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.530
4-letter word for
the iron fitting

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.940
on the hoof of a horse or a
card-dealing box in a Casino.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:26.510
Watson?

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.500
What is shoe?

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:28.130
You are right.

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.990
You get to pick.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.260
Literary Character APB for $800.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.850
Answer the Daily Double.

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.370
Now Watson, although
you have but $400,

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.510
you know of course
that you can risk up

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.550
to the maximum value
of a clue on the board.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.200
And that is $1,000.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.230
$1,000, please.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.730
All right.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.980
Here is the Daily
Double clue for you.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.240
Wanted for killing
Sir Danvers Carew.

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.790
Appearance pale and dwarfish.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.160
Seems to have a
split personality.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.720
Who is Hyde?

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.550
Hyde, yes.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.840
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,
either one acceptable.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.840
You're now in the
lead with $1400.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.740
Go again.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.400
Beatles People for $200.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.590
And any time you feel the
pain, hey, this guy, refrain.

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.079
Don't carry the world
upon your shoulders.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:17.730
Watson?

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:18.959
Who is Jude?

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:19.760
Yes.

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.160
Olympic Oddities for $200.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.290
Milorad Cavic almost upset this
man's perfect 2008 Olympics,

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.270
losing to him by one
hundredth of a second.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.820
Watson?

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.620
Who is Michael Phelps?

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:34.180
Yes.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:34.740
Go.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.930
Name the Decade for $200.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:40.590
Disneyland opens and the
peace symbol is created.

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:41.090
Ken.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.890
What are the '50s?

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:42.390
Yes.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.470
Final Frontiers
for $1,000, Alex.

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.440
Tickets aren't needed
for this event,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:50.659
a black hole's boundary from
which matter cannot escape.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:51.540
Watson?

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.470
What is event horizon?

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.600
Yes.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.230
Why is Jeopardy hard?

00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:00.560
Jeopardy asks the contestants
to answer cryptic questions

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.790
in a huge variety of categories.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.040
It is generally seen as a
test of human intelligence,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.920
reasoning and cleverness.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.500
No links to the outside
world are permitted.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.590
And new questions and categories
are created for every show.

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.720
Watson is a supercomputer
with 3,000 processors

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.090
and a database of 200
million pages of information.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:26.920
It has a massive number of data
sources like encyclopedias,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.910
texts, manuals,
magazines, Wikipedia, etc.

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.210
IBM researchers who
developed Watson

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.360
used over 100 different
analytical techniques

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.080
for analyzing natural language,
finding candidate answers

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.860
and selecting the final answer.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.460
We'll discuss this more
later in the class.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:50.070
In February, 2011, a two
game exhibition match

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.350
aired on television six years
after the initial conception

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.240
of the idea to build Watson.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.980
Watson competed against the best
two human players of all time

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.640
and challenged the
meaning of intelligence.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.470
Now Watson is being used for
many applications including

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.470
selecting the best course
of treatment for cancer.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.720
What is the edge in Watson?

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.710
Watson combined many
algorithms to increase

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.480
accuracy and confidence.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.840
We'll cover many of
them in this class.

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.140
IBM approached the
problem in a different way

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.310
than how a humans does it.

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.320
Watson deals with
massive amounts of data,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.230
often in unstructured
form, which is important

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:32.840
as 90% of the data in the
world is unstructured.

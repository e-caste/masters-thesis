WEBVTT

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.510
PROFESSOR 1: About yourselves,
so raise your hand, I guess,

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.040
if you're from Wellesley.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.530
Nobody at Wellesley
wants to fly.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.800
OK.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.610
Harvard?

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:30.130
OK.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.180
Everybody else can boo.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.110
Who has no MIT affiliation?

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.610
All right.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.910
Awesome.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.493
Well, welcome.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.480
Raise your hand if
you've never been

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.120
in a light aircraft, if
you have no experience

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.930
in a little airplane.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:50.430
OK.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:50.820
PROFESSOR 2: That's good.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.695
That's a good number.

00:00:51.695 --> 00:00:57.250
For the MIT folks, how
many of you are undergrads?

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.750
OK.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.625
That's a good number.

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:01.875
How many of you are
graduate students?

00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:06.950
It's an even larger number, and
how many of you are neither?

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.860
You're just like an
MIT alumni or staff.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.970
Just a few, OK, great.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.438
Well, welcome, all of you.

00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:15.480
PROFESSOR 1: And let's
just go through the goals.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.647
Let's see who's in the room.

00:01:16.647 --> 00:01:19.970
Who wants to eventually
fly an airplane?

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:21.330
Whoa.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.600
How about a helicopter?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.410
Good.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.190
I'm happy to see that.

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.422
What about drones?

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.380
PROFESSOR 2: All right.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.963
That's a larger
number than last year.

00:01:31.963 --> 00:01:33.852
That's great.

00:01:33.852 --> 00:01:34.810
PROFESSOR 1: All right.

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:42.600
So your course objectives are to
get ready for your official FAA

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.820
Knowledge Test.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.880
This is sometimes called
the written test as opposed

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.680
to the practical
test or the check

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.100
ride that you do at the end
of your flight training.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.500
It's available in a bunch
of different versions,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.220
including for airplanes
and helicopters.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.550
We're going to concentrate in
this class on airplane, partly

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.290
because of the show of hands.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.710
You will also be prepared though
for the FAA's remote pilot

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.770
test, if you decide to go
direct entry into the world

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.720
of commercial drones.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.930
We hope that this is
also going to help you.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.670
Any kind of thorough
study usually

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.840
helps you make more efficient
use of your in-aircraft time.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.460
And cause we have Tina here,
with her PhD in aero-astro,

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:32.930
you're going to learn something
about the engineering as well.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.220
So what is great about aviation?

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.340
People were dreaming about
flying a long time ago going

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.020
back to the ancient Greeks.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.580
Only recently, we've been able
to do it which is a good thing.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.190
One thing I like
about it is to look

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.820
at the geology and
the organization

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.340
of human settlement
on the planet.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.260
It's a lot of interesting
structural patterns

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.410
that one can see from above.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.930
Flying, a lot of the greatest
engineering achievements

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:10.510
of the last 100 years or so
are embodied in the aircraft

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.080
that you can personally go
down to the local airport,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.460
rent, and fly.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.230
Also, everybody at MIT is pretty
good at doing stuff at a desk

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.580
and thinking about hard
problems when sitting at a desk,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:34.240
but there's no emotions to
manage other than depression.

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.645
So flying combines everything.

00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:38.020
You might be a
little bit afraid.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.180
It's not natural to
be up in the air.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.960
So you're working all of your
human capacities at one time.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.690
You're managing your fear,
you're working your brain

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.700
to think about
what's coming next,

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.290
and you're also
working your muscles.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.100
Finally, you can get
to the beach quickly,

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.748
but as I note here, most
places, unfortunately

00:04:00.748 --> 00:04:03.040
little airplanes when you
factor in the weather and all

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.760
the training that you have
to do, a lot of times,

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.130
you could've gotten
door-to-door faster.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.110
PROFESSOR 2: I
might also just ask

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.170
a couple of you guys,
pretty much everyone

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.690
raised their hand
about wanting to fly,

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.870
so maybe we can just
hear from a couple of you

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.950
why do you want to fly?

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:22.810
What's your interest
in taking the course?

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.940
Yes.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.400
AUDIENCE: I'm also a PhD
student in aero-astro,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.630
so like you learn all the theory
for now, like, 5 years already,

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.053
and I think it's a normal step
to like want to do it yourself.

00:04:44.053 --> 00:04:46.220
PROFESSOR 2: That's great
so just for the folks that

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.780
couldn't hear--

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.930
and what's your name?

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:50.430
Lawrence.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.450
Lawrence was saying, he's
a PhD student in aerospace

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.010
engineering and has
learned all the theory,

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.858
and so it's a natural step to
want too go and do it yourself.

00:04:58.858 --> 00:04:59.400
That's great.

00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:05.190
PROFESSOR 1: All right.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.020
Can you do it?

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.220
Yes, as in fact appears
on the slide here,

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.920
there are a whole bunch of
little airports near us,

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.040
and we'll show them
on a subsequent slide.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.380
They all have flight
schools, and you

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.310
can rent either airplanes
or helicopters or both,

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.490
as well as find an
instructor to teach you.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.570
You can actually learned
to fly in about 10 hours.

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.310
To me, it's a little
bit unfortunate

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:36.020
that so much emphasis is
placed on getting a pilot's

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.360
certificate, because it is
an independent achievement

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.020
to actually be able to take
off, cruise around, and land

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.220
without the instructor
having to touch anything.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.750
So that achievement,
unfortunately,

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:51.000
isn't recognized with
a little certificate,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.890
but that's actually
learning to fly.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:58.170
The rest of the training,
which takes three times as long

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:00.720
as actually learning
to fly, is directed

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:04.050
at flying a broken aircraft
or a lost aircraft,

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.750
all this stuff that
prepares you to be

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.770
the only pilot in the aircraft,
which may not even be a goal.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.210
For passengers,
they would rather

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.300
have two pilots in the
front not just one pilot,

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.840
but there's a bizarre focus
on training one person

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.640
to do everything, which we'll
get into a little bit more.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:22.140
OK.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:28.080
So here's our local area, and
watch this fancy device here.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.970
Whoa.

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:32.400
So we're somewhere
between Logan Airport

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.960
on the bottom right
and Hanscom Field

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.270
which is surrounded
by dashed blue line,

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.160
telling you it's
a towered airport.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.070
So those are the two
closest airports, I think.

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.380
Norwood is just about as close.

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.700
I'll show that right here on
the lower left of the figure.

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:56.640
These airports that are
in a magenta color, those

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.070
don't have control towers.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:03.150
Over here is Beverly,
and here's Lawrence.

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:06.480
I think we've covered the
airports that MIT folks most

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.930
normally fly out of, but there's
also Nashua not too far away.

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:13.200
So you're surrounded
by airports,

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:16.290
even if Logan is the one that
you're most familiar with.

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.200
Hanscom Field is the most
substantial of the airports.

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.600
This is only about a
third of the ramp space

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.610
and hangars and structures
built up around Hanscom.

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:28.740
That's a picture that I
took from a Robinson R44

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.980
helicopter, which you guys
could be flying in next week.

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.160
And Tina's going to
tell you what she

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.825
likes to do on a typical trip.

00:07:39.825 --> 00:07:41.700
PROFESSOR 2: So we heard
from a couple of you

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.780
that are observers or
participants in the MIT flying

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.440
club.

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.080
Did anyone participate
in the fly-out

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.440
a couple of years ago
to Maine, to Bar Harbor?

00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:54.740
All right.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.180
So this is a picture from
that flight to Bar Harbor.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.450
Just grab the clicker for me.

00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:00.950
Thanks.

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.870
So if you were to
drive, we took off just,

00:08:06.870 --> 00:08:10.410
as Phillip was describing,
one of the nearby airports

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.090
is at Hanscom.

00:08:12.090 --> 00:08:14.850
So we took off from Hanscom.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.810
If you were to drive, it would
be a 4 1/2 hour drive to get

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.093
there and back.

00:08:20.093 --> 00:08:21.510
So it wouldn't
really be something

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:24.210
that you could easily
do as a day trip,

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:26.780
but since we were flying,
it was a great day trip.

00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.720
So we flew up along the coast
all the way to Bar Harbor,

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.370
and what was really
great about that

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:33.750
is that we could go hiking.

00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.530
So all these folks flew
in little airplanes

00:08:37.530 --> 00:08:41.010
from the Boston area
through the MIT flying club,

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:43.230
and we all flew up to
the Bar Harbor, Maine.

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:46.485
And then we went hiking in
the Acadia woods and forests,

00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:49.110
and it was really
beautiful, wonderful day,

00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:53.560
and then we flew back and landed
just after sunset back here.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.880
So it was a really beautiful
experience and a lot of fun

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.260
to fly along the coastline.

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:00.470
So I highly recommend it.

00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:06.540
If you're looking
for a longer trip.

00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:08.070
PROFESSOR 1: So I designed this.

00:09:08.070 --> 00:09:09.570
You can check it
out on my web blog.

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:13.800
It is a trip in a
little Cirrus that'll

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:18.390
take you to all 48
states in just 18 days

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.700
and only about 50
hours of flight time,

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.070
and that's a pretty
standard little airplane.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:26.610
But more importantly,
so people who--

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:28.950
I just came back from
Bentonville, Arkansas,

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.890
and there's a guy there
who's the grandson of Sam

00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:33.750
Walton, the founder of Walmart.

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:37.200
So he can pretty much
do anything he wants,

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.400
and what does he like to do?

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.860
He has a couple P51 Mustangs.

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.660
He was flying alongside
this little game

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.750
Verde aerobatic plane
that we were testing out.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.330
He's got a super Corsair.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:52.350
There were only 10 built. He
started as a little flight

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.030
school at the local airport.

00:09:54.030 --> 00:09:57.270
He flies his little
Phemon 300 business

00:09:57.270 --> 00:09:58.840
jet all over the world.

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.220
So I think that's a
proof that flying is fun,

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:04.830
because people who
could do anything

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.990
that they want to do also fly.

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:08.490
You're going to
meet people from all

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:11.010
around the world of
all different ages.

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:15.060
It's a very diverse group,
especially if you like older

00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.760
guys, [LAUGHTER] which I do.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.260
Is it safe?

00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:25.760
OK.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.160
So we're going to show
you how to make it safe.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:32.750
It's not safe statistically,
compared to JetBlue,

00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:36.020
but that's not because
little airplanes or feeble.

00:10:36.020 --> 00:10:39.260
As you'll see in this class, I
think it's because of the way

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.660
that people have
been flying them.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:45.170
So we're going to show you how,
if you train like the airlines

00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.460
and fly like the airlines, you
can get much closer to airline

00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.800
level of safety in
little airplanes,

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.860
as long as you're a little bit
conservative with the weather.

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:58.610
And if all else fails, if
you're flying a modern design

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:01.160
airplane, reach up and
pull the parachute.

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.200
And the whole airplane
will float down,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:06.960
and you'll get out into a swamp.

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:07.460
All right.

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:08.800
I'm taking mine back.

00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:18.330
I thought that she was
on air, but she's not.

00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:18.910
OK.

00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:20.190
So this is me.

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:21.900
I was class of 82 at MIT.

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.970
It was much more challenging
then than it is for you guys.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:27.840
That's because the Wisconsin ice
sheet was covering the campus

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.880
to a depth of about 100 feet.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.460
So we had to tunnel our
way from East Campus

00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.410
into the main buildings.

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:36.570
I've been flying since 2002.

00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:42.270
I'm an instructor at East Coast
Aero Club at Hanscom Field.

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.460
I was also a regional jet pilot.

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.860
I decided to learn to fly
jets, and there's no better way

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:49.170
to do that than at the airlines.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:53.670
So I flew a 50-seat regional
jet called the CRJ, Canadair

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.180
Regional Jet, for Delta.

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.180
I have type ratings, which
we'll get into later.

00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:00.840
You need specific licensing for
each turbo jet powered aircraft

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.220
that you fly.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.410
So I've got two of those.

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:08.190
One of them is for the
smallest Cessna business jet.

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:12.542
I usually fly though, these
days, a four-seat Cirrus,

00:12:12.542 --> 00:12:15.600
a Robinson R44, a
four-seat helicopter,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:22.260
and a Pilatus PC-12 which holds
either 11 people total or 60

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:25.440
sea turtles, which we'll
get into a little bit later.

00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.550
PROFESSOR 2: So this is
a little bit about me.

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.820
In the top left
corner, you'll see me.

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:39.440
I'm actually sitting in a
Cessna 172, here at Hanscom,

00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:41.390
and I'm doing my engine run-up.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.330
And what do you
see out the window?

00:12:44.330 --> 00:12:47.710
Does anyone recognize it?

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.630
AUDIENCE: An F-18.

00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.210
PROFESSOR 2: An F-18,
so what's really cool

00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:54.150
is that this airport
that I fly out of,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:58.320
Hanscom, is also a
military Air Force Base.

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.150
Which is really exciting,
because upon occasion,

00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:03.900
you'll actually see
military jets come out.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:05.890
And they, of course,
did not wait for me,

00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:08.640
even though I was first in line.

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.480
They nicely cut in front.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.460
They called themselves jet 1
and jet 2, and they went out.

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.380
And it really looked
like they didn't

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.880
take any space at all, any of
the runway length to take off.

00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:24.300
It really looked, from where I
was sitting, right next to it,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.150
like they just turned like
a rocket ship and took off,

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:30.820
and it was really amazing.

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:32.020
PROFESSOR 1: Sorry, Tina.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:33.020
PROFESSOR 2: No problem.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.340
So this is just a
picture of me just

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.820
going on a flight with some
other MIT folks in the area,

00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:45.090
and then, of course, if all else
fails, you can just jump out.

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:46.600
So a little bit of background.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.710
So I'm also aero-astro,
just like you, Lawrence,

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:53.560
and so I studied Course 16 here.

00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:57.430
I did my undergrad in 2009,
and I was really passionate

00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:59.950
about it and continued on.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:02.410
And I did the MIT System
Design and Management

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:06.100
Program for my master's
degree and then continued on

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:10.780
in an interdepartmental PhD
across Aero-Astro Engineering

00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.340
Systems and Sloan.

00:14:12.340 --> 00:14:14.380
It was a really
great experience.

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.600
One of the things that got
me really excited about it

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.960
is that, when I was an undergrad
in the Course 16 department,

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:21.550
we were developing
a satellite, and we

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:22.840
needed to test that satellite.

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:25.485
So we actually got to go
on a zero gravity flight.

00:14:25.485 --> 00:14:27.610
So I don't know, has anyone
heard of a zero gravity

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:29.690
flight or the Vomit Comet?

00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:30.190
All right.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:32.210
So a couple of folks
didn't raise their hands.

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:36.970
So the idea is that
the plane flies

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.580
in a parabolic trajectory.

00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:42.910
And much like a
roller coaster, when

00:14:42.910 --> 00:14:44.980
you're at the top
of the parabola,

00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:46.360
or the top of the
roller coaster,

00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:49.103
you know how your stomach
feels like it's lifting?

00:14:49.103 --> 00:14:50.770
All right, we're
getting some head nods.

00:14:50.770 --> 00:14:54.200
The rest of you guys really
need to go on a roller coaster.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.200
So when you get that,
you can actually,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.700
when an airplane
flies like that,

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.910
you can have everyone
inside the airplane float up

00:15:00.910 --> 00:15:04.510
and have that sensation of
zero gravity, or microgravity.

00:15:04.510 --> 00:15:06.910
It lasts about 30
seconds, and that's also

00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.910
how they filmed certain
movies, like Apollo 13,

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:11.870
to show the astronauts
in weightlessness.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.810
So we use that to
test our satellite.

00:15:13.810 --> 00:15:15.310
So it was a really
great experience.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.893
It got me really
excited about things,

00:15:16.893 --> 00:15:18.580
and then I felt
very similar to you,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.290
that I wanted to see
the theory in action,

00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.670
and so I became a pilot.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.680
In terms of my
professional career,

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.830
I developed electronic
warfare systems.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:30.320
I went on to Raytheon.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.470
I was the chief engineer
of a $40 million

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:36.370
advanced radar and
electronic warfare system.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.190
Now, I'm into entrepreneurship
and have my own company

00:15:39.190 --> 00:15:40.870
in the security space.

00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:42.790
And I've been a
pilot since 2012,

00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:45.370
and I love flying with
the MIT Flying Club.

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:48.640
And I'm currently
working on my IFR.

00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:50.930
Who knows what an
IFR stands for?

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:52.202
Shout it out.

00:15:52.202 --> 00:15:53.273
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:15:53.273 --> 00:15:54.190
PROFESSOR 2: Good job.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:55.328
Instrument flight ratings.

00:15:55.328 --> 00:15:56.620
If you don't know, that's fine.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.160
We're going to cover that.

00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.940
So we'll explain it
all, but right now, I

00:16:00.940 --> 00:16:04.180
fly a, pretty much usually, the
training aircraft, the Cessna

00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:05.000
172.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.450
It's a very, very safe
and stable aircraft.

00:16:07.450 --> 00:16:10.152
So we'll talk about a bunch
of different aircraft.

00:16:10.152 --> 00:16:11.110
PROFESSOR 1: All right.

00:16:11.110 --> 00:16:15.310
So let's hope that you've
done the pre-reading.

00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.750
If you hadn't, I know everybody
here in this room, at least

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.630
the MIT and Harvard folks,
are good at the book stuff.

00:16:22.630 --> 00:16:25.090
So please do hit the books.

00:16:25.090 --> 00:16:28.480
Some of the thornier and
less interesting topics

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.900
we're going to rely on you
to read through the book.

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:34.310
So don't worry if you get
everything in the class.

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:37.240
We're giving you the highlights
that are in the books,

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.820
and passing is 70 on the test.

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:40.760
All right.

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.500
Optional supplies, just
for your reference,

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.430
if you study a typical
flight student, a lot of them

00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:51.370
will have a non-FAA textbook.

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:52.840
It's not necessary,
but some people

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.348
like the different perspective.

00:16:54.348 --> 00:16:56.140
There's a free online
one that we reference

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:59.020
later that is written
by a PhD physicist which

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.995
is kind of interesting.

00:17:01.995 --> 00:17:03.370
A lot of people
have in hard copy

00:17:03.370 --> 00:17:06.130
a big, thick book called
FAR/AIM with the regulations

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:12.460
and the FAA's overall guidance
on how to use airports

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.369
and electronic navigation.

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:19.329
There are test preparation
books that you can get

00:17:19.329 --> 00:17:20.890
and electronic
versions of this that

00:17:20.890 --> 00:17:22.030
just give you sample tests.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:27.520
You're going to use one of the
websites from the King Schools.

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.980
It's a popular vendor for those.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:31.870
And then before your
check ride, you'll

00:17:31.870 --> 00:17:34.570
be reading the Airman
Certification Standards.

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:37.280
FAA still use this
sexist language.

00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.230
There's airman and
airmen for all pilots,

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.370
and this is tells you what you
need to demonstrate when you're

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.200
getting your final check.

00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.300
Most people will also buy
their own personal headset.

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:54.480
The noise-canceling ones
make life a lot better.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:57.310
Lightspeed is probably a
little more rugged than Bose.

00:17:57.310 --> 00:17:59.950
Bose is more
comfortable on the ears.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:01.780
The front desk of a
typical flight school

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:04.360
will have all of
this stuff for sale.

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.220
The process, a lot of
people wonder, well,

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.540
how do I get my private
pilot's license.

00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.640
You need the flight training.

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.100
You apply for student pilot
certificate on an FAA website.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.100
I don't know if that's
still running completely.

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:19.392
I just renewed the
registration for an aircraft,

00:18:19.392 --> 00:18:20.850
so that part of
the FAA is running.

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.480
I don't know if they're sending
out Student Pilot Certificates

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.240
during the shutdown or not.

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:30.180
You have to do one
medical exam in your life

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:38.370
at least with an aviation doctor
who's been blessed by the FAA,

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.980
and you get your
third class medical.

00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:42.750
After, eventually,
you'll be able just

00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:46.470
to go to your regular
doctor, if you want.

00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:48.150
Then, you take this
knowledge test,

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:52.960
and that's what you're being
prepped for in this class.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:54.840
And finally, you'll
do your practical exam

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.795
with an FAA-designated
examiner, one of whom

00:18:56.795 --> 00:18:58.170
should actually
be here tomorrow.

00:18:58.170 --> 00:19:00.660
So you can ask him
how he tortures

00:19:00.660 --> 00:19:03.390
people on the check ride.

00:19:03.390 --> 00:19:05.790
Actually, I had
to take one-- you

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:08.490
have to do a lot of these steps
over again, when you do a type

00:19:08.490 --> 00:19:10.050
rating for a new aircraft.

00:19:10.050 --> 00:19:12.810
So when I worked at
the airline, the oral,

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.140
there is a guy who
is famously harsh.

00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.760
And he would keep
people who were trying

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:21.570
to fly the Canadair Regional
Jet in knots for hours

00:19:21.570 --> 00:19:24.162
and have them sweating
during the oral exam.

00:19:24.162 --> 00:19:25.620
And the first
question he asked me,

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.980
the airplane has
these hydraulic pumps.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:32.050
They're AC motors, and it has
the engines generating the AC

00:19:32.050 --> 00:19:32.550
power.

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:35.160
But a lot of stuff runs
on DC, and I'd really

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.780
wondered about the electrical
systems of the airplane.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.113
So I called up a friend of mine.

00:19:39.113 --> 00:19:41.190
It's a physics professor
at UC Berkeley,

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:44.370
and we had a one-hour discussion
about when it made sense

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:46.650
to generate AC and
pipe that around

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:50.070
the airplane and high voltage
versus low voltage and DC.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:53.310
And so I hung up and said
goodbye to my friend, Joel.

00:19:53.310 --> 00:19:56.280
And then a few weeks later,
there was the oral exam,

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.990
and the first
question the guy asked

00:19:57.990 --> 00:20:00.860
me was-- and I'd
put on my resume

00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.360
that I just had a
bachelor's degree.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.520
I didn't list any
of my other degrees.

00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:07.020
I have a PhD in AAS, it happens.

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:12.360
So this guy who is the bane of
all the pilots at this Delta

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:17.250
subsidiary, he said, Philip,
why does the airplane

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.273
have both an AC and a DC system?

00:20:20.273 --> 00:20:21.690
So I gave him a
little five minute

00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:24.810
spiel based on my conversation
with my physics professor

00:20:24.810 --> 00:20:25.470
friend.

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:28.420
He said, OK the oral is over.

00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:30.795
It's time to go
into the simulator.

00:20:30.795 --> 00:20:33.060
Didn't ask me a
single other question.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:33.570
All right.

00:20:33.570 --> 00:20:36.666
So let's do the part that
we should have done earlier.

00:20:36.666 --> 00:20:38.840
Now, at least, I know
how to put on the mic.

00:20:41.760 --> 00:20:44.790
So it's conventional
in religious settings

00:20:44.790 --> 00:20:48.060
to bring in a reformed
sinner, and that's

00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:53.370
what we have here,
somebody who's found faith

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:55.595
and is now living with faith.

00:20:55.595 --> 00:20:57.720
GUEST SPEAKER: Thank you
so much, Phillip and Tina,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:58.960
for having me here.

00:20:58.960 --> 00:20:59.910
I'm Minakshe.

00:20:59.910 --> 00:21:02.520
I'm a fourth year PhD
student at Harvard.

00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:05.010
I do neuroscience,
and when I'm not

00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:08.430
trying to understand
how the brain works,

00:21:08.430 --> 00:21:10.980
I like to do most
things adventurous.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.380
And I had really awesome
friends who introduced me

00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:17.370
to the MIT Flying Club, so that
was my first general aviation

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:18.550
experience.

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:22.320
I was a passenger on a fly-out
to the Republic Airport.

00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:24.330
It's in Long Island.

00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.440
It's really nice, because
most of the times, if we get

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.980
cleared, you get to
fly over the Hudson,

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.840
and you get this really nice
view of the New York skyline.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.640
So the other photo is actually
Phillip and his sitter.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.570
So we're super lucky to
be on another fly-out

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.020
out as a passenger, and I
got to fly in his Cirrus.

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.390
So this is to Chatham, another
really beautiful airport

00:21:51.390 --> 00:21:53.070
in the Cape Cod.

00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:55.440
So all of that inspired
me to become a pilot,

00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:59.910
but what really enabled me
was precisely this course.

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.100
So I am doing my
PhD in neuroscience.

00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.290
My aviation knowledge
was literally

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.012
like [INAUDIBLE] it
was like, OK, there

00:22:06.012 --> 00:22:08.220
are all these little buttons
and dials, probably just

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.010
have to check all those things
and just like magic the planes

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:11.970
are flying.

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:16.200
So this course was what
really laid the foundation

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:19.560
for the aviation experience
in the rest of my life.

00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.562
And Tina was one
of our instructors,

00:22:22.562 --> 00:22:23.520
when I took the course.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.978
It was a slightly
different format.

00:22:24.978 --> 00:22:27.900
It was over the entire
semester, once a week,

00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.203
but I really enjoyed it.

00:22:30.203 --> 00:22:31.620
So at the end of
it, I felt really

00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:34.860
ready to take the
practical flying lesson.

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:39.600
So I was a student pilot at
East Coast Aero Club, Bedford.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.200
So my two years of grad
school stipend that I saved

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:48.630
was like put to really good
use and the picture on the left

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.460
is my first solo.

00:22:50.460 --> 00:22:55.050
So that's me doing the
traffic pattern at Bedford.

00:22:55.050 --> 00:22:58.740
So I didn't have any like fancy
electronic flight back then.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:22:59.870
It was just all paper maps.

00:22:59.870 --> 00:23:01.890
So that was just
the GPS on my phone

00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:05.350
tracking me doing the traffic
pattern Bedford, and like you

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:07.700
can see how happy I
was with all my solos,

00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.790
the smileys on my logbook.

00:23:09.790 --> 00:23:15.460
So then, think end of September,
got my private pilot's license.

00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:19.120
So I flew the Warrior, so yeah.

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:24.940
So that's me right after passing
the check ride in the Warrior.

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:30.100
So after PPL, I wanted
to take spin training

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.370
and did a little bit of
aerobatics in the decathlon

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:34.650
at East Coast.

00:23:34.650 --> 00:23:37.300
So decathlon is a tail-wheel
aerobatic aircraft,

00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:40.270
and when you do
your PPL, they're

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.535
always going to tell you
like you will do stalls,

00:23:42.535 --> 00:23:44.410
and they're always going
to tell you like OK,

00:23:44.410 --> 00:23:46.130
and we don't want to spin.

00:23:46.130 --> 00:23:48.370
I was like, OK, I want
it feel heart is going.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:48.870
Yeah?

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:51.010
PROFESSOR 2: Maybe share
what PPL stands for.

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:51.760
GUEST SPEAKER: Oh, sorry.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:52.260
Yeah.

00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.415
PPL is Private Pilot's License
which is what all of us

00:23:55.415 --> 00:23:56.660
are here for.

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:03.310
So yeah, so after a little
bit of aerobatics and spin

00:24:03.310 --> 00:24:05.470
training, so my recent
flying experience

00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:10.180
is being a lot with the MIT
flying club now as a pilot.

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:12.290
So I did the same--

00:24:12.290 --> 00:24:15.160
the first time I was ever
on the light aircraft

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.920
was this fly-out with
the MIT Flying Club

00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:19.630
to Republic Airport.

00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:22.240
And very recently, I
did that as a pilot,

00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:25.180
getting passengers
with the Flying Club.

00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:26.520
So that felt really nice.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.510
So you can see, like
I'm over the Hudson,

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:33.130
2,00 feels southbound,
towards the Republic,

00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:37.960
and you get this really awesome
view of the New York skyline,

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.220
and yeah.

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:40.780
It's really beautiful.

00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:43.090
You get to talk to like
Laguardia, New York,

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.250
and I spoke to Kennedy tower.

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.890
That was like literally
a dream come true for me.

00:24:47.890 --> 00:24:50.770
So I would relive this moment
like any number of times.

00:24:50.770 --> 00:24:55.130
I'm 500 feet above the ground
level, and like you can see,

00:24:55.130 --> 00:24:59.200
the tiny shadow of my aircraft
and like talking to JFK.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.460
And in 500 feet, because there
are all these commercial jets

00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.460
descending to land
at JFK, so it's

00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.530
a totally beautiful feeling.

00:25:08.530 --> 00:25:10.270
So I've also been
flying with my friends,

00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:12.310
and like this is the
Winnipesaukee lake

00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:17.230
near Laconia, New Hampshire, and
yeah, for the Harvard folks--

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.520
I think it's just one person--

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:20.520
you can probably recognize
like Sanders Theatre.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.090
So this is a city tour.

00:25:22.090 --> 00:25:27.360
So you get cleared into the
Boston class Broadway airspace.

00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:27.860
Yeah.

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:29.610
This is one of my
friends who took a photo

00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.323
of like the Harvard campus.

00:25:32.323 --> 00:25:34.240
You can see Sanders
Theatre at Memorial Church

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.040
and just the fog setting in.

00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.160
So my mom visited me from India.

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:38.920
I took her flying.

00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.885
So that was a very
beautiful feeling

00:25:40.885 --> 00:25:42.510
like to show her what
this means to me.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.635
Although, she was totally
terrified the whole time.

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.260
Yeah.

00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:49.610
So I guess,
obviously, I love it.

00:25:49.610 --> 00:25:52.000
It's really fun the
beautiful view is experience

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.610
and like the super
adrenaline excitement

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.220
every time I have the plane.

00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.510
And it is challenging,
and it's really

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:00.160
something like new
rewarding to learn

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.830
from every single experience,
every single flight

00:26:02.830 --> 00:26:05.022
and, of course, the people.

00:26:05.022 --> 00:26:05.660
So yeah.

00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:09.310
Thank you, and just
sharing my experience

00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:12.620
from like having no aero-astro
background to being here,

00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:15.520
I hope it inspires some of you.

00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.754
Thanks.

00:26:16.754 --> 00:26:20.058
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:23.262 --> 00:26:24.970
PROFESSOR 2: Thank
you so much, Minakshe,

00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:27.670
for coming back and
sharing your experience.

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:32.160
So that could be
you guys next year.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.250
So a little bit about
the FAA written exam.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:37.580
So as we said, sometimes
it's called the written.

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:40.700
That is the
knowledge-based exam.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:43.010
So that is what, ideally,
you'll be prepared

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:45.500
to pass with flying colors.

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.130
So it's a computer-based
multiple choice exam.

00:26:49.130 --> 00:26:51.380
They usually give you
about 2 1/2 hours,

00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:53.960
and you don't necessarily
need the whole time.

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.650
There are 60 questions,
and they basically

00:26:57.650 --> 00:26:59.430
shuffle those questions.

00:26:59.430 --> 00:27:02.270
So we're going to be
teaching content somewhat

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:05.957
that goes beyond this exam,
because this is an MIT course.

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.790
So we're actually in
teach a little bit more

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:11.450
about the aerodynamics and
how really planes fly and go

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:13.750
a little bit beyond
just the course,

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:15.920
but we will cover
all of this material.

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:21.590
And then, so as Phillip already
said, to pass you need as a 70,

00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:25.440
but we believe that you
can score higher than that.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:30.560
So we really encourage you
to take this exam right

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:33.830
after the course.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.290
Phillip can actually
endorse your log book,

00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:38.810
or you can actually
print out a log book

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.340
and endorse you to
take that written exam.

00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:44.420
So just following the course,
the final exam of this course,

00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:47.667
will be a practice a exam,
and so you can take that.

00:27:47.667 --> 00:27:49.250
You can actually
take it as many times

00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:51.250
as you want in order to
pass, but hopefully, you

00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:54.060
don't have to take
it too many times.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.580
And after that,
we'll endorse you

00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:59.060
so that you can actually go
take the actual FAA written exam

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.540
and get that out of the way.

00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:02.570
So you can be on your
way to becoming a pilot.

00:28:04.983 --> 00:28:05.650
PROFESSOR 1: OK.

00:28:05.650 --> 00:28:08.227
So most East Coast Aero Club--

00:28:08.227 --> 00:28:10.060
I'm an instructor there--
most of the people

00:28:10.060 --> 00:28:12.850
that I've seen will skim
through at least the FAA

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:15.940
books about three times
before they take the test.

00:28:15.940 --> 00:28:20.140
They will use a test prep
book, and they end up

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:22.570
getting a 98 or 100 on the exam.

00:28:22.570 --> 00:28:25.090
So they do a little bit--

00:28:25.090 --> 00:28:28.090
they go a little bit overboard
if the goal is just to pass.

00:28:28.090 --> 00:28:30.670
Again, if you have
the physics question,

00:28:30.670 --> 00:28:33.190
a physics-type question,
we do recommend

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:36.730
this free online textbook
from this physics PhD.

00:28:36.730 --> 00:28:38.500
These presentations,
of course, are all

00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:40.300
available from the
course homepage.

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:43.840
You can download them
and follow all the links.

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.470
As Tina mentioned,
I can endorse you.

00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:50.260
Any aero-astro majors who
complain that it's too hard,

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.005
remember that everything that
you're reading from the FAA

00:28:53.005 --> 00:28:55.920
is designed for somebody
who's still in high school.

00:28:58.990 --> 00:28:59.710
Tina.

00:28:59.710 --> 00:29:01.820
PROFESSOR 2: So this is
just a sample question.

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:03.700
They give you a flavor.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.770
Obviously, we haven't
touched the material yet,

00:29:05.770 --> 00:29:08.187
but why don't we just take a
minute to read this, and then

00:29:08.187 --> 00:29:11.915
see if you guys can have a good
guesstimate as to the answer?

00:29:11.915 --> 00:29:13.540
So I thought this
would be appropriate,

00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:15.220
given the weather conditions.

00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:18.280
You guys had to trudge through
a lot of snow and slush

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.610
to get here today.

00:29:19.610 --> 00:29:21.640
So here's a question
about frost.

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:25.015
Why is frost considered
hazardous to flight?

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:41.900
OK.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.890
Who thinks it's A?

00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:48.820
Who thinks it's B?

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:49.450
All right.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:51.080
Who thinks it's C.

00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.600
All right, good job, guys.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:56.660
Just generally, icing,
bad for a plane.

00:29:56.660 --> 00:29:59.900
So anything that's really
increasing lift or increasing

00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:01.370
control effectiveness,
that's not

00:30:01.370 --> 00:30:03.740
what you're getting
when you have frost.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:05.060
It's a bad thing.

00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:07.572
So we'll discuss
this in more detail.

00:30:07.572 --> 00:30:08.530
PROFESSOR 1: All right.

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:14.170
Here's the schedule for
the next couple days.

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:18.700
We'll just talk about
the parts that are fun.

00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:23.710
This afternoon, we're going to
be visited by an F-22 pilot.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.540
That's a little better
than a Cessna, Piper,

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.440
or Cirrus in terms
of performance,

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:33.240
if not in terms of
cost-effectiveness.

00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:36.220
Lunchtime, there's
going to be pizza

00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.370
and a slideshow about
Oshkosh, the big aviation

00:30:39.370 --> 00:30:43.750
gathering that happens
in Wisconsin every year.

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:47.980
Tomorrow, you're going to
hear from a designated pilot

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.710
examiner, Marc
Nathanson, who's also

00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:57.880
an acrobatics instructor and a
US Air Force F4 fighter pilot

00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:58.870
veteran.

00:30:58.870 --> 00:31:02.110
Day three, Michael Holdsworth
who's going to come in.

00:31:02.110 --> 00:31:07.010
He's a local drone
pilot for Hollywood.

00:31:07.010 --> 00:31:10.840
So he'll tell you about using
the commercial drone license

00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:14.080
to do something interesting.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:17.680
At lunch on day three,
on Thursday, you're

00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:21.132
going to hear from a veteran.

00:31:21.132 --> 00:31:22.840
Actually, no, he's an
active duty officer

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.510
in the Brazilian Air
Force who's here at MIT,

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:30.100
and he's going to tell you
about being a test pilot.

00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.610
And then at the
end of the class,

00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:38.080
we've tacked on the
founder of ForeFlight

00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:40.900
which is one of the most
successful aviation app

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:41.440
companies.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.300
They're in a lot
of airline cockpits

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:46.063
now as a replacement
for paper, and they

00:31:46.063 --> 00:31:47.230
do a lot of flight planning.

00:31:47.230 --> 00:31:50.320
And so he's going
to bring himself

00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:52.990
to talk about any questions
you might have about starting

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.847
a company and being
successful in business

00:31:55.847 --> 00:31:57.430
and also one of his
engineering folks,

00:31:57.430 --> 00:32:00.160
I think, to talk about the
engineering behind the app.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.140
That's going to be a
little bit more informal.

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.550
It's optional, but we
think it'll be interesting.

00:32:06.550 --> 00:32:07.060
OK.

00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:11.230
So welcome again,
and now you're part

00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:13.450
of the community of
aviators, at least as

00:32:13.450 --> 00:32:19.000
soon as you go on your first
MIT Flying Club fly-out.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.710
It is better to be
on the ground wishing

00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:24.050
you were in the air
than vice versa,

00:32:24.050 --> 00:32:25.630
but people have
been wishing to be

00:32:25.630 --> 00:32:28.810
in the air for tens
of thousands of years.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:32.080
And we think that--

00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.930
well, we feel lucky
to be some of the few

00:32:34.930 --> 00:32:38.770
who are able to control our
own destiny through the air.

00:32:38.770 --> 00:32:41.590
So now, it's time for questions.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:44.380
While you're formulating
your brilliant questions,

00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:49.620
enjoy these photos which I
snapped at the Reno air races,

00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.470
where the Blue Angels
obviously already visited.

00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:58.660
AUDIENCE: What's the
[INAUDIBLE] on the airplane?

00:32:58.660 --> 00:33:00.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:04.290
PROFESSOR 1: So what why do
you have both AC power and DC

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:07.110
power on a big jet?

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:08.610
Big jets, the
flight controls are

00:33:08.610 --> 00:33:11.550
too heavy to be
operated by a human,

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.920
so you need hydraulic power.

00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.973
Basically, there may still
be steel cables going out

00:33:15.973 --> 00:33:17.640
to the flight controls,
but they're just

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.770
modulating hydraulic pressure.

00:33:19.770 --> 00:33:21.780
How do you generate
hydraulic pressure?

00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:26.250
There's a big motor to
pump the hydraulics,

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:30.360
and it's easier to run a
big motor with AC power

00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:35.130
compared to DC power, and the
engines are also spinning.

00:33:35.130 --> 00:33:37.500
So if you just think
about Maxwell's equations,

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:41.820
it's simpler to run AC for
that, and also, of course, you

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:44.410
can have higher voltage
and transform it down.

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:48.340
And then for the electronics,
DC power is what they want.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.850
So that's why the DC's in there,
to run radios and so forth.

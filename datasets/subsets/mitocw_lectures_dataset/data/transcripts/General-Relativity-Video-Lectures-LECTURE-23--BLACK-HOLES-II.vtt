SCOTT HUGHES: So in
this final lecture,

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.910
I want to think a bit
sort of with an eye

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.960
towards thinking about
how one might actually

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.300
make measurements that prove
the nature of the black hole

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.740
spacetime that was discussed
the previous lecture.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.166
I'm going to discuss motion
in a black hole spacetime.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:45.620
We touched on this a little
bit in the previous lecture,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.870
where we discussed the motion
of radial light rays, OK?

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.840
We, in fact, used radial
light rays as a critical tool

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.690
for describing the
properties of the spacetime.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:01.610
We use that to help us
understand the location

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.819
of events horizons.

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:04.819
But I want to think a
little bit more generally.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:06.194
What might it look
like if I have

00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:08.475
material orbiting in
the vicinity of one

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:09.350
of these black holes?

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.308
What if it's not light?

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:12.420
What if it's made out of matter?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.330
And so what this is
going to boil down to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.500
is understanding the behavior
of geodesics in a black hole

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.300
spacetime.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.330
And the naive approach to doing
this is not wrong, but naive.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.820
What you do is you would
just take the spacetime--

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.670
take your Schwarzschild or
take your Kerr spacetime--

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.280
and turn a very large crank,
grind out all of the connection

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:55.170
coefficients, evaluate
the geodesic equation,

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.360
integrate it up.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.080
Solve for the geodesics.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.390
Boom, you got yourself
your motion, OK?

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.170
And that is absolutely correct.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.960
You can do that using
your Kerr space time

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.810
or your Schwarzschild spacetime.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.030
In fact, if you do that for--

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.477
you can get the connection
coefficients describing this.

00:02:18.477 --> 00:02:20.060
Those are relatively
easy to work out.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.510
I think they are listed in
Carroll, in equation 5.53,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.992
according to my notes.

00:02:24.992 --> 00:02:26.450
That may just be
for Schwarzschild.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.460
But at any rate, they're all
listed there, and have a blast.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.470
This approach is
not wrong, but--

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.152
my notes say, but
it is not useful.

00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:39.110
That's not really true.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.860
I'll just say that there is a
more useful approach to this.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:56.930
A more fruitful approach is to
exploit the fact that these are

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.690
highly symmetric spacetimes.

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.030
Exploit the symmetries
and the Killing

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:22.430
vectors, and see
how they can be used

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.337
to reduce the number
of degrees of freedom

00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:26.420
that you need to describe.

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.830
In this lecture, I'm
going to go through this

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.980
in quite a bit of detail
for Schwarzschild.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.490
The concepts that I'm
going to apply work

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.375
for Kerr and for
Kerr-Newman as well, OK?

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:57.500
Schwarzschild is just a
little easier to work with.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.802
It's something that I can
fit into a single lecture.

00:04:00.802 --> 00:04:03.260
In particular, one of the nice
things about Schwarzschild--

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.485
so let's go ahead and
write down that spacetime.

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.530
So one of the nice things
about Schwarzschild

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.660
is it is spherically symmetric.

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:37.560
This means I can always
rotate coordinates such that--

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.060
well, when me think
about it-- let's

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.490
just back up for a second.

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:44.540
Imagine that I have some kind of
a body orbiting a Schwarzschild

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.280
black hole.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.770
Spherical symmetry
tells me that there

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.820
must be some notion of a
conserved angular momentum such

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.348
that that orbit always
lies within a given plane.

00:04:57.348 --> 00:04:58.140
Put it another way.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.650
Because it is fairly symmetric,
there cannot exist a torque.

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:12.560
The black hole cannot
exert a torque that changes

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:23.200
the orientation of
the orbital plane.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.360
In particular, because
it is fairly symmetric,

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.720
there is no unique notion of
an equator to this object.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.730
And so you might as well define
any orbits to live in the theta

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:41.230
equals pi over 2 plane.

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:56.420
You can always rotate
your coordinates

00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:06.880
to put any orbit in the
theta equals pi over 2 plane.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.850
It's actually a pretty
simple exercise.

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.340
I won't do this,
but if you start

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.910
with an orbit that is in the
theta equals pi over 2 plane,

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:21.730
and it is moving such that its
initial velocity would keep it

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.710
in a theta equals
pi over 2 plane,

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:27.880
it's a very simple exercise
using the geodesic equation

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.540
to show that it will
always be in the theta

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.280
equals pi over 2 plane.

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.260
So spherical symmetry
says, you know what,

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:38.410
let's just forget about the
theta degree of freedom.

00:06:38.410 --> 00:06:40.840
I can always define my
coordinates in such a way

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.740
that it lives in the theta
equals pi over 2 plane.

00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:48.400
Boom, I have reduced my
motion from, in general,

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.067
being three spatial dimensions
to two spatial dimensions.

00:06:52.067 --> 00:06:53.650
That's another one
of the reasons why,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.630
for pedagogical purposes,
it's nice to start

00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:57.060
with Schwarzschild.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:00.180
For Kerr, this is
not the case, OK?

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:02.240
Kerr is a little bit
more complicated.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.610
You have to treat the
theta motion separately.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.860
It's not strictly symmetric,
and so you can't do that.

00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:12.700
I have actually spent
a tremendous amount

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.940
of my career studying
the orbits of objects

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:15.940
around Kerr black holes.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:19.570
And I do have to say that the
additional complications that

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.730
arise from this
lack of sphericity,

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:23.020
they're really beautiful, OK?

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:26.940
There's an amazing amount of
fun stuff you can do with it.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.630
You know, there's
a reason why I just

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.380
keep coming back to
this research problem,

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:36.820
and part of it is
it's just bloody fun.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.460
But if you're teaching this
stuff for the first time,

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:41.470
it's not where
you want to begin.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.510
All right, so
Schwarzschild allows

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:46.780
us to reduce it from a
three-dimensional problem

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.710
to a two-dimensional problem.

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.230
And Schwarzschild also
has two Killing vectors.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:57.940
The time derivative of every
metric component is equal to 0.

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:01.015
That means p downstairs
t is constant.

00:08:09.510 --> 00:08:11.910
So there is a timelike
Killing vector.

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.810
So p downstairs t is constant
every level along the orbit.

00:08:15.810 --> 00:08:18.780
It means there exists a
timelike Killing vector.

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:22.780
And so what we do
is we associate this

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:25.690
with the energy of the orbit.

00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:28.780
We call this up to a minus sign.

00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:30.970
And we choose that minus
sign because if we imagine

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:32.740
orbits have very,
very large radius,

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:35.804
the spacetime is
nearly flat, and we

00:08:35.804 --> 00:08:37.929
want to sort of clear out
the minus sign associated

00:08:37.929 --> 00:08:39.789
with lowering our index here.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:42.159
We're going to call
that constant negative

00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:43.590
of the energy of the orbit.

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:58.680
The spacetime is also
independent of the angle phi.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:07.560
And so p sub phi is a constant.

00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.650
This means that the spacetime
has an axial Killing

00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:13.975
vector, something associated
with motions around a symmetry

00:09:13.975 --> 00:09:14.475
axis.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.520
So I'm going to
call this L-- well,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.850
actually, I will tend
to call it L sub z.

00:09:20.850 --> 00:09:23.470
You can kind of think
of this as, after I

00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:26.410
have put everything in the
theta equals pi over 2 plane,

00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:32.080
this is like an angular
momentum on the--

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.920
angular momentum parallel to
the axis normal to that plane,

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:37.420
and I call that the z-axis.

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.180
It's worth noting that
all three of these things

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.450
are also true for
Reissner-Nordstrom black holes.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:48.620
This one is not true for
Kerr, but these two are, OK?

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:54.130
So although the details
change, many of the concepts

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.920
will carry over when you look
at different, more complicated

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.620
classes of black holes.

00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.370
Let's now think about
the forward momentum

00:10:00.370 --> 00:10:02.740
of a body moving in a
Schwarzschild spacetime.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:22.820
So let's say it's
got a rest mass m,

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:25.890
then it will have
three components.

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.770
Remember, I have put
this thing in a plane

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.090
where there is no theta motion.

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:35.530
It will have three theta
motions describing its motion

00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:37.030
with respect to the
time coordinate,

00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:42.070
the radial coordinate, and
the actual coordinate phi, OK?

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.690
So before I do
anything with this,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:47.410
let's take advantage of the fact
that we have these quantities

00:10:47.410 --> 00:10:49.790
that are constants.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.870
So using the fact
that p downstairs mu

00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.240
is what I get when
I hit this guy--

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.210
that be a mu, pardon me.

00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:03.680
This is what I get when I
hit this guy with the metric.

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.245
I can write out a p
sub t and p sub phi.

00:11:08.245 --> 00:11:10.010
So let's do that
on another board.

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:12.050
Well, let's do a p sub t first.

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:20.932
So p sub t is going
to be gtt, p sub--

00:11:20.932 --> 00:11:21.432
whoops.

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:32.430
OK, this is minus.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:34.350
There's an m from that--

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:35.860
minus sign from my metric.

00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:52.352
And this whole thing I define
as the negative energy, e.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.210
OK, so that combination--

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.500
we'll do something at the
rest mass in just a moment.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.930
But you should
basically look at this

00:12:07.930 --> 00:12:12.370
and saying that dt d
tau, which tells me

00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:16.060
about how the body moves with
respect to the Schwarzschild

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.000
time coordinate--

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.240
that complement of the
four velocity times 1 minus

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:25.390
2gm over r is a constant.

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.730
Let's look at p downstairs phi.

00:12:30.472 --> 00:12:36.180
So this is m r squared
sine squared theta.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:44.870
Ah, we've chosen our orbital
plane, 1 times d phi d tau.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:52.560
This is equal to [INAUDIBLE]
momentum L sub z.

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:55.260
In my notes, I might flip around
a little bit between L sub z

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.910
and L.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:13:02.900
So let's massage these
a little bit more.

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.790
So I can take these
two expressions

00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.980
and I can use them
to write dt d tau

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:17.990
and d phi d tau in terms of
these conserved quantities.

00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:20.870
So dt d tau is equal to--

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:33.725
I'm going to call it e hat
divided by 1 minus 2gm over r.

00:13:33.725 --> 00:13:40.930
d phi d tau is going to be
Lz hat over our squared.

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:44.110
And so these
quantities with a hat

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:52.920
are just the conserved values
normalized to the rest mass,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.868
OK?

00:13:53.868 --> 00:13:55.660
They all are proportional
to the rest mass,

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.830
but it's actually if you
want to know what the--

00:13:58.830 --> 00:14:01.330
this is essentially telling me
about how clocks on the orbit

00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:04.750
tick relative to clocks that
are infinitely far away.

00:14:04.750 --> 00:14:08.840
And that can't depend on the
mass of the orbiting object.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.080
This is telling me about
how this small body is

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.458
moving according to the clock
of the orbiting observer.

00:14:14.458 --> 00:14:16.750
And again, that can't depend
on the mass of the object.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.260
OK, so that's kind of cool.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:24.430
So I've now managed
to relate three--

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:27.130
excuse me, two of
the three components

00:14:27.130 --> 00:14:32.020
of the forward momentum to
functions of r and quantities

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.330
that are known to be constant.

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:36.160
That's good.

00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.170
We have one more
overall constraint.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:53.960
We know that if I take p dot p,
I get negative of the rest mass

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.460
squared.

00:14:58.150 --> 00:15:01.360
So this, when I write it out--

00:15:32.190 --> 00:15:37.850
OK, notice every single term
is proportional to m squared.

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:40.180
So I can divide that out.

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.930
I can insert dt d tau.

00:15:43.930 --> 00:15:47.560
I can replace for this
e divided by this guy.

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.420
I can replace d phi d tau by
my Lz hat divided by r squared.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:09.810
Doing so, manipulating
a little bit, I get--

00:16:28.842 --> 00:16:31.710
we get something like this.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.190
And let me rearrange
this a tiny bit.

00:17:13.099 --> 00:17:16.800
All right, I have
managed to reduce this

00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:20.310
to a one-dimensional
problem, OK?

00:17:20.310 --> 00:17:25.380
So going from that line over
to there, basically all I did

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:31.560
was insert the relationship
between dt d tau and E, d phi

00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.550
d tau and L, cleared out some
overall factors of things

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:39.610
like 1 minus 2GM/r, manipulate,
manipulate, manipulate,

00:17:39.610 --> 00:17:42.180
and what you finally get is
this lovely equation here

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:47.460
that tells you how the radial
velocity, the radial velocity

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:50.640
with respect to
proper time, how it

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:57.420
depends as a function of r
given the energy and the angular

00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.840
momentum.

00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:03.990
I have written it in this
form because the problem

00:18:03.990 --> 00:18:10.800
is very strikingly reminiscent
to the Newtonian problem

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.990
of understanding the motion of
a particle in a 1/r potential,

00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:19.950
which we often describe as
having an effective potential

00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.230
that has a gravitational term--

00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:23.850
Newton's gravity,
or if you're doing

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:26.280
things like quantum mechanics,
the Coulomb potential,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:29.010
and a Coulomb barrier
associated with the angular

00:18:29.010 --> 00:18:32.340
momentum of an orbit.

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:35.430
So one way to approach
what we've got now,

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:40.750
one thing that we could
do, is essentially just

00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:48.410
pick your energy and your Lz--

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:50.870
pick your energy and
your angular momentum--

00:18:50.870 --> 00:18:52.265
pick an initial position--

00:19:00.935 --> 00:19:05.940
let's imagine you synchronize
the clocks at t equals 0--

00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:07.876
and then just integrate.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:20.780
You've got your dr
d tau given here.

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:27.500
Don't forget, you also have d
phi d tau and dt d tau related

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.880
to the energy and your
angular momentum, like so.

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:30.380
Boom.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:31.190
It's a closed system.

00:19:31.190 --> 00:19:33.170
You can always do just sort of
a little numerical integration

00:19:33.170 --> 00:19:33.670
of this.

00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.340
In a certain sense,
this completely

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:40.760
specifies the problem.

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:43.660
But there's so much
more we can do.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:46.870
In particular, what
we see is that all

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.530
of the interesting behavior
associated with this orbit

00:19:50.530 --> 00:19:54.354
is bound up in this
function V effective.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:13.000
So something that's
really useful for us to do

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.440
is to take a look at what
this V effective looks like.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.750
So suppose you are
given a particular value

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:26.410
for E hat and Lz hat, and you
plot V effective versus r.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:39.310
Well, what you typically
find is that it's

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:45.710
got a behavior that looks kind
of like this, where this value

00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:57.190
right here is V
effective equal to 1.

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.020
Notice as r goes to
infinity, you get 1 times 1.

00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.610
So this asymptotes to 1.

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:11.040
Notice E hat squared has the
same dimensions as V effective.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.670
In fact, in the unit
choices I've used here,

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.050
they are both dimensionless.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.200
So what we can do is plot--

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.920
let's imagine that we have--

00:21:25.737 --> 00:21:26.320
you know what?

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.390
I'm going to want to sketch
this on a different board.

00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:29.223
Let me go over here.

00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:36.990
So I'm going to want to look
at a couple of different values

00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:38.325
of V effective--

00:21:41.328 --> 00:21:43.370
excuse me, a couple of
different values of E hat.

00:22:12.457 --> 00:22:12.980
OK.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:14.020
Here's an example.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.230
This guy is asymptoting at 1.

00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:20.660
So since E hat, as I said,
has the same units as V

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:34.770
effective, let's
plot them together.

00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:49.420
So example one-- imagine
if E hat lies right here.

00:22:53.030 --> 00:22:53.530
OK.

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.340
So let's call this E hat 1.

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:06.160
So this is some value
that is greater than 1.

00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.970
What is the point of doing this?

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:11.492
Well, notice-- I'm
going to flip back

00:23:11.492 --> 00:23:13.450
and forth between these
two middle boards here.

00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.540
Let's look at the
equation that governs

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:25.400
the radial motion of this body.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:39.360
dr d tau has to
be a real number.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:51.190
This has to be a real number.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:55.200
So we have to have E
hat squared greater than

00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:01.400
or equal to V effective
in order for dr d tau

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.650
to have a meaningful solution.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.090
So let's look at my
example here, E hat 1.

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:32.860
E hat 1 is greater than
my effective potential

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.580
everywhere at all radii
until I get down to here.

00:24:43.062 --> 00:24:45.430
Let's call that r1.

00:24:45.430 --> 00:24:53.890
So in this case, dr d tau,
if I think about this thing--

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.380
so note that defines
dr d tau squared.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.250
Let's suppose we take
the negative square root.

00:24:59.250 --> 00:25:03.005
dr d tau is positive
and inward--

00:25:03.005 --> 00:25:05.057
or, well, it's negative--

00:25:05.057 --> 00:25:07.390
negative and real, negative
and real, negative and real,

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:09.430
negative and real,
negative and real-- boom.

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:10.080
It's 0.

00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:14.310
Can it go into here?

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:15.360
No.

00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:19.290
It cannot go into there, because
there E hat squared is less--

00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:23.080
sorry.

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.430
That should have been squared.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.380
Inside here, E hat
squared is less

00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:29.440
than the effective potential.
dr d tau is imaginary.

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.300
That doesn't make any sense.

00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.890
The only option is for this
guy to change sign and trundle

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:37.760
right back out.

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.470
So E hat greater
than 1 corresponds

00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:56.270
to a body that comes
in from large radius,

00:25:56.270 --> 00:26:08.010
turns around at particular
radius where E hat is

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:11.020
the square root of the
effective potential,

00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:18.380
and then goes back out to
infinity or back out to-- let's

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.500
not say infinity-- goes
back out to large radius.

00:26:25.813 --> 00:26:27.270
OK?

00:26:27.270 --> 00:26:31.890
In Newtonian gravity, we would
call this a hyperbolic orbit.

00:26:31.890 --> 00:26:33.670
This corresponds
to-- so remember,

00:26:33.670 --> 00:26:35.070
when I did this I have not--

00:26:35.070 --> 00:26:37.860
I'm not actually-- I'm only
computing the radial motion.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:39.880
I'm not looking
at the phi motion.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.140
So this actually, when you
look at both the radial

00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.450
motion and the phi
motion, what you see

00:26:45.450 --> 00:26:48.628
is that this is a body that
comes in and then sort of whips

00:26:48.628 --> 00:26:50.670
around that small radius
and goes right back out.

00:26:57.260 --> 00:26:59.330
Let's look at another example.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:07.130
Let's call this E2--

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:12.970
some value that is less than 1.

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:17.250
OK.

00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:22.690
Well, for E hat 2,
it's a potential.

00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.810
The potential is underneath
E hat 2 squared only

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:41.710
between these two radii, which
I will call r sub p and r sub a.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:49.610
What we expect in this case is
motion of this body essentially

00:27:49.610 --> 00:27:53.000
going back and forth
and turning around

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.130
at periastron and apoastron.

00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:04.670
This is a relativistic
generalization

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:06.170
of an elliptical orbit.

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:07.670
In general relativity,
they turn out

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:10.310
generally not to be ellipses.

00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:11.870
So we call this an
eccentric orbit.

00:28:35.790 --> 00:28:38.970
In the weak field limit, if
you imagine r being very, very

00:28:38.970 --> 00:28:44.190
large, it's not hard to show
that the motion is nearly

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:48.120
an ellipse, but it's an ellipse
whose long axis is slowly

00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.770
precessing.

00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:52.980
This actually leads to the
famous perihelion precession

00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:57.160
of Mercury that Einstein
first calculated.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:29:00.270
And this is an
exercise that I am

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:04.620
asking you to do on one of the
final P-sets of this course.

00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:06.540
Using what I have set
up here, it's really not

00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.960
that difficult to do.

00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.350
Let me go to another board.

00:29:16.060 --> 00:29:26.530
And note that one could imagine
an energy such that dr d tau

00:29:26.530 --> 00:29:27.715
is exactly 0.

00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:43.640
So if you choose your
energy so that you

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:48.020
sit right here at the
minimum of the potential--

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.450
I will label this as point s--

00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.520
the energy that
corresponds to exactly that

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.280
point is what would be a--

00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:01.990
that is, there is a single point
at which dr d tau equals 0.

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:03.520
Anywhere away from
that, dr d tau

00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:06.010
would be imaginary, so
that's not going to work.

00:30:06.010 --> 00:30:12.640
But right at that point,
dr d tau equals 0,

00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:13.930
and you get a circular orbit.

00:30:16.988 --> 00:30:19.280
Notice there's a second point
at which that can happen.

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:20.450
Let's call this point u.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:32.090
Perhaps you can guess why I
called these points s and u.

00:30:32.090 --> 00:30:34.935
If you imagine that you
add a tiny amount of energy

00:30:34.935 --> 00:30:36.310
right here, well,
what it will do

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.850
is it will execute small
oscillations around the point

00:30:39.850 --> 00:30:40.385
s.

00:30:40.385 --> 00:30:42.010
It will sort of move
it up to something

00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:44.830
that's similar to what
I drew up there as E2,

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:47.570
but with a very
small eccentricity.

00:30:47.570 --> 00:30:52.960
So if I slightly disturb a
circular orbit down here at s,

00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:55.030
I essentially just
oscillate in the vicinity

00:30:55.030 --> 00:30:57.190
of that circular orbit.

00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.930
S stands for stable.

00:31:01.730 --> 00:31:05.440
If I have an orbit up here at
u and I very slightly perturb

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:12.070
it, well, it'll either go in
and eventually reach r equals 0,

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:15.102
or it'll go out, and then
it's completely unbound,

00:31:15.102 --> 00:31:17.560
and it will just keep trundling
all the way out essentially

00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.750
forever.

00:31:19.750 --> 00:31:21.730
This guy is unstable.

00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:31.700
Stable orbits are particularly
interesting and important.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.440
So let's look at these orbits
with a little bit more care.

00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.570
So the very definition
of a circular orbit

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:56.060
is that dr d tau equals 0.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.615
Its radius does not change.

00:32:05.230 --> 00:32:09.160
If dr d tau equals
0, then it must

00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:17.067
have E hat equal the square
root of the effective.

00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:23.350
Both of these orbits
happen to live

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.820
at either a minimum or a
maximum of this potential curve.

00:32:38.710 --> 00:32:46.410
So I'm going to require
that the partial derivative

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:48.600
of that potential with
respect r be equal to 0.

00:32:53.070 --> 00:32:54.910
So let's take a look
at this condition.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:03.590
My effective potential
is given up here.

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:07.640
Do a little bit of algebra with
this, set this guy equal to 0.

00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:18.090
What you'll find after
your algebraic smoke clears

00:33:18.090 --> 00:33:22.020
is that you get this condition
on the angular momentum.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.840
Notice as r gets really large--

00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:43.340
oh, shoot.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.320
Try it again.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:51.560
Notice as r gets
really large that this

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:58.560
asymptotes to plus or minus
the square root of GM r.

00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:02.280
That is indeed exactly what you
get for the angular momentum

00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:05.600
of a circular Newtonian orbit.

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:06.450
OK.

00:34:06.450 --> 00:34:08.040
So it's a nice sanity check.

00:34:13.510 --> 00:34:15.820
It appears to be
somewhat pathological

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:18.969
as r approaches 3GM, though.

00:34:18.969 --> 00:34:19.719
Hold that thought.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.110
OK.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:48.719
So now let's take
that value of L,

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:53.820
plug it back into the
potential, and set

00:34:53.820 --> 00:35:00.720
E equal to the
square root of that.

00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.340
A little bit of algebra ensues.

00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:21.010
And what you find is that
this equals 1 minus 2GM/r

00:35:21.010 --> 00:35:25.240
over, again, that factor under
a square root of 1 minus 3GM/r.

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:28.090
Again, we sort of see
something a little bit

00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:33.060
pathological happening
as r goes to 3GM.

00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:35.690
Let me make two
comments about this.

00:35:35.690 --> 00:35:39.610
So first of all, notice that
this energy is smaller than 1.

00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:55.310
I can intuitively-- you can
sort of imagine-- remember,

00:35:55.310 --> 00:35:57.440
E hat is the energy
per unit rest mass.

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:04.180
You can think of
this as something

00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:08.200
like total energy over M--

00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:11.170
so the energy associated
with the orbiting body.

00:36:11.170 --> 00:36:18.310
It's got a rest energy,
a kinetic energy,

00:36:18.310 --> 00:36:25.050
and a potential
energy divided by m.

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:29.070
For an orbit to be bound,
the potential energy,

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:31.260
which is negative, must
have larger magnitude

00:36:31.260 --> 00:36:33.150
than the kinetic energy.

00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:37.080
So for a bound orbit, E
kinetic plus E potential

00:36:37.080 --> 00:36:39.660
will be a negative quantity.

00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:42.150
So the numerator is
going to be something

00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.250
that, when normalized
to m, is less than 1.

00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:45.730
So this is exactly
what we expect

00:36:45.730 --> 00:36:48.180
to describe a bound orbit.

00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:50.880
Notice, also-- so if
you take this formula

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:59.160
and look at it in the large r
limit, it goes to 1 minus GM

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:00.930
over 2r.

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:03.600
This is in fact
exactly what you get

00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.570
when you look at the energy
per unit mass throwing in--

00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.690
sort of by hand--

00:37:09.690 --> 00:37:11.220
a rest mass.

00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:14.160
The minus GM/2r
exactly corresponds

00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:19.257
to kinetic plus potential for
a Newtonian circular orbit.

00:37:19.257 --> 00:37:21.090
So lots of stuff is
hanging together nicely.

00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:30.110
So we've just learned that we
can characterize the energy

00:37:30.110 --> 00:37:35.270
and angular momentum of circular
orbits around my black hole.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.700
Let's look at a couple other
things associated with this.

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:41.420
So these plots where I
look at the radial motion,

00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:46.410
this effective potential, as
I mentioned a few moments ago,

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:47.930
there's additional
sort of degrees

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:50.750
of freedom in the motion that
are being suppressed here.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:54.050
So this thing is also
moving in that plane.

00:37:54.050 --> 00:37:56.600
It's whirling around
with respect to phi.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.290
We've lost that information in
the way we've drawn this here.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:07.120
Let's define omega to be the
angular velocity of this orbit

00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:09.260
as seen by a distant observer.

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:23.300
OK.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.900
Why am I doing it as seen
by a distant observer?

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:29.620
Well, when things
orbit, there tend

00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:34.580
to be periodicities that imprint
themselves on observables.

00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.673
It could be the
period associated

00:38:36.673 --> 00:38:38.840
with the gravitational wave
that arises out of this.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.900
It could be the
period associated

00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:46.040
with peaks and a light curve
if this is a star orbiting

00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:47.900
around a black hole.

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:52.400
It could be oscillations
in the X-ray flux

00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.410
if this is some kind of
a lump in an accretion

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:57.210
disk of material
orbiting a black hole.

00:38:57.210 --> 00:38:59.720
So if this is the angular
velocity seen by distant

00:38:59.720 --> 00:39:04.010
observers-- remember, the time
that distant observers use to--

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:07.100
the time in which the
distant observers' clocks run

00:39:07.100 --> 00:39:10.280
is the Schwarzschild time t.

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:19.070
So this will be d phi dt, which
I can write as d phi d tau--

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:23.690
this is the angular velocity
according to the orbit itself--

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:29.120
normalized to dt d tau.

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.810
Now, these are both
quantities that are simply

00:39:32.810 --> 00:39:36.470
related to constants of motion.

00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:41.040
What I've got in the numerator
here is L hat over r squared.

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.650
And what I've got
in the denominator

00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:47.980
here is E hat over 1 minus--

00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:49.698
I dropped my t.

00:39:49.698 --> 00:39:50.990
It would happen at some point--

00:39:50.990 --> 00:39:52.355
1 minus 2GM/r.

00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.460
So let's go ahead and
take our solution here.

00:40:04.070 --> 00:40:09.920
My E hat is 1 minus 2GM/r
divided by square root of blah,

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.640
blah, blah.

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:13.550
The 1 minus 2GM/r cancels.

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:20.630
My L hat is square root
GM r divided by, again,

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:23.510
that square root 1 minus 3GM/r.

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:28.250
Notice, the square root 1
minus 3GM/r factors all cancel.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:38.160
So this becomes plus or minus
1 over r squared square root GM

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:38.660
r.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.730
Looks like this.

00:40:45.730 --> 00:40:49.180
Plus and minus basically
just correspond to

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.880
whether this motion
sort of is going

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.770
in the same sense as
your phi coordinate

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.203
or in the opposite sense.

00:40:55.203 --> 00:40:56.620
There's really no
physics in that.

00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:00.850
It just comes along for the
ride that both behave the same.

00:41:00.850 --> 00:41:02.530
If you guys get
interested in this,

00:41:02.530 --> 00:41:05.830
and you do a similar calculation
around a Kerr black hole,

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.200
you'll find that your
prograde solution gives you

00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.930
a different frequency than your
retrograde solution because

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:13.270
of the fact that the
dragging of inertial frames

00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:15.730
due to the spin of the
black hole kind of breaks

00:41:15.730 --> 00:41:17.880
that symmetry.

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.960
Something which is
interesting and--

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.460
well, I'll make a comment about
this in just a second, which

00:41:23.460 --> 00:41:24.490
is kind of interesting.

00:41:24.490 --> 00:41:26.865
And here's what I'll say--
sometimes people think this is

00:41:26.865 --> 00:41:28.620
more profound than
it should be--

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:34.410
is this is, in fact, exactly
the same frequency law

00:41:34.410 --> 00:41:37.050
that you get using
Newtonian gravity.

00:41:37.050 --> 00:41:45.570
This is actually exactly
the same as Kepler's law.

00:41:52.490 --> 00:41:54.150
That seems really, really cool.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:41:54.650
And it is.

00:41:54.650 --> 00:41:55.817
It's actually really useful.

00:41:55.817 --> 00:41:57.830
It makes it very easy
to remember this.

00:41:57.830 --> 00:42:01.310
But don't read too much into it.

00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:03.470
More than anything,
it is a statement

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:07.220
about a particular quality
of this radial coordinate.

00:42:07.220 --> 00:42:12.170
So remember, in Newtonian
gravity r tells me

00:42:12.170 --> 00:42:14.780
the distance between--
if I have an orbit at r1

00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.590
and an orbit at r2, then I know
that the distance between them

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:22.257
is r2 minus r1.

00:42:22.257 --> 00:42:24.840
In the Schwarzschild spacetime,
the distance between these two

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.990
orbits is not r2 minus r1.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:34.170
However, r2 labels a sphere of
surface area 4 pi r2 squared.

00:42:34.170 --> 00:42:38.730
And r1 labels a sphere of
surface area 4 pi r1 squared.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:42.510
It's easy to also show that
the circumference of the orbit

00:42:42.510 --> 00:42:45.330
at r2 is 2 pi r2,
the circumference

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:48.630
of the orbit at r1 is 2 pi r1.

00:42:48.630 --> 00:42:50.820
That, more than anything,
is why we end up

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:52.650
reproducing Kepler's
law here, is

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:56.880
that this areal
coordinate is nicely

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.296
amenable to this interpretation.

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:13.110
So is this orbit--

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:15.980
so I described over here
an orbit that is unstable

00:43:15.980 --> 00:43:19.100
and an orbit that is stable.

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:20.870
I have described
how to compute--

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:23.780
if I wanted to find a
circular orbit at a given

00:43:23.780 --> 00:43:28.680
radius, those formulas
that I derived over there

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:31.950
on the right-most
blackboards, they tell me

00:43:31.950 --> 00:43:34.320
what the energy and
the angular momentum

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.650
need to be as a function of r.

00:43:37.650 --> 00:43:40.560
Is that orbit stable?

00:43:40.560 --> 00:43:47.370
Well, if it is, I can
check that by computing

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:51.558
the second derivative of
my effective potential.

00:43:58.110 --> 00:44:09.090
So my orbits are stable if the
second derivative with respect

00:44:09.090 --> 00:44:20.690
to r is greater than 0,
unstable if this turns out

00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:23.420
to be negative.

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:26.550
Let's look at the crossover
point from one to the other.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:29.600
What if there is a
radius where, in fact,

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.410
the stable and the
unstable orbits coincide?

00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:35.630
In fact, what one
finds, if you look

00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:38.270
at the effective potential--
you imagine just sort of playing

00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:39.680
with L sub z.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.690
So let's say we
take that L sub z,

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:45.440
and we just explore it for
lots of different radii

00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.880
of the orbits.

00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:48.950
You find that as the
orbits radius gets

00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:52.762
smaller and smaller, your
stable orbit tends to go up,

00:44:52.762 --> 00:44:54.470
and this minimum sort
of becomes flatter,

00:44:54.470 --> 00:44:56.470
and your unstable orbit
just kind of comes down.

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:58.970
They sort of
approach one another.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.090
There is a point just
when they coincide--

00:45:04.777 --> 00:45:06.360
this should have an
"effective" on it.

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:07.442
My apologies.

00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:16.830
Right when they
coincide, this defines

00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:19.190
what we call the
marginally stable orbit.

00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:30.000
I may have put this
one on a problem set.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.083
But it might be one of the
ones I decided to drop.

00:45:32.083 --> 00:45:34.200
So I'm just going to go
ahead and do the analysis.

00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:39.180
When you compute this, bearing
in mind that your angular

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:41.070
momentum is a constant--

00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:58.250
so take this, substitute in
now your solution for L sub z,

00:45:58.250 --> 00:45:59.750
which I've written
down over there--

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:22.240
what you find is that the
marginally stable orbit--

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:26.830
let's call it r sub ms--

00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:29.540
it is located at
a radius of 6GM.

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:44.330
This is a profoundly
new behavior

00:46:44.330 --> 00:46:49.640
that doesn't even
come close to existing

00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:52.530
in Newtonian spacetime--

00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:54.830
spacetime-- doesn't come
close to existing in Newtonian

00:46:54.830 --> 00:46:57.469
gravity, excuse me.

00:46:57.469 --> 00:47:02.210
[SIGHS] I'm getting tired.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.570
The message I want
you to understand

00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:17.420
is that, what this tells us is
that no stable circular orbits

00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:30.155
exist inside r equals 6GM.

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:37.700
So this is very, very
different behavior.

00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:42.560
If I have-- let's just say
I have a very compact body

00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:45.140
but Newtonian gravity rules.

00:47:45.140 --> 00:47:46.693
I can make circular
orbits around it,

00:47:46.693 --> 00:47:48.860
basically go all the way
down until they essentially

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.485
touch the surface of that body.

00:47:50.485 --> 00:47:51.860
And you might
think based on this

00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.902
that you would want to
make orbits that basically

00:47:53.902 --> 00:47:56.510
go all the way down, that
sort of kiss the edge of r

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:58.520
equals 2GM.

00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:02.300
Well, this is telling
you you can't do that.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.830
When you start
trying to make orbits

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:05.997
that go inside-- at least,
circular orbits-- that go

00:48:05.997 --> 00:48:10.190
inside 6GM, they're not stable.

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:14.000
If someone sneezes
on them, they either

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.340
are sort of blown
out to infinity,

00:48:16.340 --> 00:48:19.100
or they fall into
the event horizon.

00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.800
And in fact, one of the
consequences of this

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.500
is that, in
astrophysical systems,

00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:27.710
we generically expect there
to be kind of-- if you imagine

00:48:27.710 --> 00:48:30.560
material falling
into a black hole,

00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.020
imagine that there's like a
star or something that's just

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:36.560
dumping gas into orbit
around a black hole, well,

00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:39.765
it will tend to form a disk
that orbits around this thing.

00:48:39.765 --> 00:48:41.390
And the elements of
the disk are always

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.370
rubbing against each
other and radiating.

00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:44.870
That makes them get hot.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:48.030
They lose energy because
of this radiation.

00:48:48.030 --> 00:48:49.940
And so they will very
slowly sort of fall in.

00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.195
But they make this kind of--

00:48:51.195 --> 00:48:52.820
it's thought that in
most cases they'll

00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.620
make this kind of
thick disk that

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:58.275
fills much of the spacetime
surrounding the black hole.

00:48:58.275 --> 00:48:59.900
But there will be a
hole in the center.

00:48:59.900 --> 00:49:02.425
Not just because the
thing is a black hole.

00:49:02.425 --> 00:49:03.800
I don't mean that
kind of a hole.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.258
There'll actually be something
surrounding the black hole's

00:49:06.258 --> 00:49:09.380
event horizon, because there
are no stable circular orbits.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:12.770
Once the material comes in and
hits this particular radius,

00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:17.120
6GM in the Schwarzschild case,
it very rapidly falls in,

00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:19.910
reduces the density of
that material tremendously.

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:21.950
And you get this much
thinner region of the disk

00:49:21.950 --> 00:49:24.920
where essentially things fall
in practically instantly.

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:30.840
It should be noted that
this 6GM is, of course, only

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:32.040
for Schwarzschild.

00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.200
If you talk about
Kerr, you actually

00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.970
have two different
radii corresponding

00:49:35.970 --> 00:49:38.460
to material that goes around
parallel to the black hole's

00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:41.100
spin and material that
goes anti-parallel

00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.930
to the black hole's spin.

00:49:42.930 --> 00:49:44.400
And it complicates
things somewhat.

00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.080
There's two different
radii there.

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:48.590
The one that goes parallel tends
to get a little bit closer.

00:49:48.590 --> 00:49:50.007
The one that's
anti-parallel tends

00:49:50.007 --> 00:49:52.230
to go out a little bit farther.

00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:54.210
But the general
prediction that there's

00:49:54.210 --> 00:49:57.700
an innermost orbit beyond which
stable orbits do not exist,

00:49:57.700 --> 00:50:03.850
that's robust and holds across
the domain of black holes.

00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:07.740
So let me conclude
by talking about one

00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.450
final category of orbits--

00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.310
photon orbits.

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.770
So let's recall that
when we were talking

00:50:22.770 --> 00:50:40.040
about null geodesics, we
parametrized them in such a way

00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:41.880
that d--

00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.460
sort of the tangent
to the world line

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:55.530
has an affine parameter attached
to it, such that we can write p

00:50:55.530 --> 00:51:00.750
equals dx d lambda.

00:51:00.750 --> 00:51:01.845
These guys are null.

00:51:05.130 --> 00:51:07.690
So p dot p equals 0.

00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:13.850
For the case of
orbiting bodies, that

00:51:13.850 --> 00:51:15.440
was equal to minus mass squared.

00:51:15.440 --> 00:51:17.927
Mass is 0 here.

00:51:17.927 --> 00:51:20.010
So we're going to follow
a very similar procedure.

00:51:20.010 --> 00:51:22.910
The spacetime is still
time independent,

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:25.820
so there is still a notion
of a conserved energy.

00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.850
It is still actually symmetric,
so there is still a notion

00:51:28.850 --> 00:51:32.030
of axial angular momentum.

00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:35.870
But because p dot p is 0 now,
rather than minus m squared,

00:51:35.870 --> 00:51:39.920
when we go through the exercise
of-- that sort of parallels

00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.990
what we did for our
massive particle,

00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:44.360
we're going to derive
a different potential.

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:52.940
So let's go ahead and
evaluate this guy again.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:52:06.130
And I get 0 equals minus
1 minus 2GM/r dt d lambda

00:52:06.130 --> 00:52:14.610
squared plus 1 minus
2GM/r dr d lambda squared.

00:52:14.610 --> 00:52:16.110
I'm still going to
require the thing

00:52:16.110 --> 00:52:18.300
to be in the theta
equals pi/2 plane

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:20.620
so that we know theta term.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.620
And I have set theta to pi/2.

00:52:22.620 --> 00:52:24.810
So my sine squared
theta is just one.

00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:30.580
So I get this.

00:52:33.550 --> 00:52:35.500
I'll remind you
that I can relate--

00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:40.290
so the relationship between
the time-light component

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:43.960
of momentum and energy, the
axial component of momentum,

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.720
and the angular momentum, it's
exactly the same as before.

00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:48.430
There's no rest mass appearing.

00:52:48.430 --> 00:52:51.160
And so now I find--

00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:54.792
so my energy, I don't
put a hat on it.

00:52:54.792 --> 00:52:57.250
It's not energy bringing it
mass, because there is no mass.

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.620
That looks like so.

00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:16.650
And my L looks like so.

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:37.020
Using them, I can now
derive an equation

00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:41.120
governing the radial
motion of my light ray.

00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:56.650
And sparing you the line or two
of algebra, it looks like this.

00:54:13.377 --> 00:54:14.460
Pardon me just one moment.

00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.280
OK.

00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:23.730
OK.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:27.070
So kind of similar to what we
had before, if you look at it

00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:29.760
you'll see the term involving
the angular momentum

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:33.050
is a little bit different.

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:35.480
As you stare at
this for a moment,

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.220
something should
be disturbing you.

00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:42.800
Notice that the
equation of motion

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:47.640
appears to depend on the energy.

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:49.170
OK.

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:51.660
That should really bug you.

00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:57.060
Why should gamma rays
and infrared radiation

00:54:57.060 --> 00:55:00.540
follow different trajectories?

00:55:00.540 --> 00:55:03.390
As long as I am truly in
a geometric optics limit,

00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:05.130
I shouldn't.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:08.320
Now, it is true that if you
consider very long wavelength

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:10.320
radiation, you might need
to worry about things.

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.200
You might need to solve the
wave equation in the spacetime.

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:18.060
But as long as the wave
nature of this radiation is--

00:55:18.060 --> 00:55:20.790
if the wavelength is small
enough that it's negligible

00:55:20.790 --> 00:55:22.530
compared to 2GM--

00:55:22.530 --> 00:55:25.140
I shouldn't care
what the energy is.

00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:27.900
Energy should not
be influencing this.

00:55:27.900 --> 00:55:31.020
So what's going on is
I need to reparametrize

00:55:31.020 --> 00:55:32.170
this a little bit.

00:55:32.170 --> 00:55:37.710
What I'm going to do to
wash away my dependence on--

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:40.710
wash away my apparent
dependence on the energy here,

00:55:40.710 --> 00:55:43.507
is I'm going to redefine
my affine parameter.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.270
So let's take lambda--

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:57.300
so L divided by lambda.

00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:07.215
And I am going to define
b to be L divided by E.

00:56:07.215 --> 00:56:11.448
This is the quantity that I
will call the impact parameter.

00:56:15.678 --> 00:56:17.220
And I'll describe
why I am calling it

00:56:17.220 --> 00:56:21.100
that in just a few minutes.

00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:24.120
So I'm going to take this entire
equation, divide both sides

00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:25.005
by L squared.

00:56:45.790 --> 00:56:49.060
And I get something
that looks like this.

00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:08.450
What I'm going to do is say
that the impact parameter, b,

00:57:08.450 --> 00:57:10.262
is what I can control.

00:57:10.262 --> 00:57:11.720
It's the parameter
that-- all I can

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:15.830
control that defines the
photon that I am studying here.

00:57:15.830 --> 00:57:20.150
And everything after this,
this is my photon potential.

00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:34.250
Notice that the photon potential
has no free parameters in it.

00:57:58.370 --> 00:58:04.166
If I plot this guy
as a function of r,

00:58:04.166 --> 00:58:07.760
it kind it just looks like this.

00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.710
Two aspects of it are
worth calling out.

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:21.340
This peak occurs
at r equals 3GM.

00:58:26.820 --> 00:58:31.667
Remember the way in which our
energy-- oh, still have it

00:58:31.667 --> 00:58:34.000
on the board here-- things
like the energy per unit mass

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.420
and the angular momentum
per unit mass all

00:58:36.420 --> 00:58:40.040
blew up when r equal 3GM.

00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:44.400
3GM is showing up
now when I look

00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:49.260
at the motion of radiation,
look at massless--

00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:54.000
radiation corresponding to a
massless particle, so to speak.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.530
If I look at the energy per unit
mass, and the mass goes to 0,

00:58:58.530 --> 00:59:00.250
I get infinity.

00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:02.400
So the fact that I
was actually seeing

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:05.460
sort of things blowing
up as r goes to 3GM

00:59:05.460 --> 00:59:08.940
was kind of like the equations
hinting to me in advance

00:59:08.940 --> 00:59:13.620
that there was a hidden solution
corresponding to radiation that

00:59:13.620 --> 00:59:15.600
could be regarded as
a particular limit

00:59:15.600 --> 00:59:17.100
that they were
sort of struggling

00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:19.440
to communicate to me.

00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:20.940
The other thing
which I want to note

00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:24.480
is that the potential, the
height of the potential right

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:42.190
here, it has a peak value of
1 over 27 G squared M squared.

00:59:42.190 --> 00:59:45.640
Hold that thought
for just a moment.

00:59:45.640 --> 00:59:49.000
Actually, let me write it
in a slightly different way.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:56.640
This equals 1 over
3 root 3 GM squared.

01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:14.410
So now, to wrap this up I need
to tell you what is really

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:16.998
meant by this impact parameter.

01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:42.710
So go back to
freshman mechanics.

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:46.220
And impact parameter
there is-- like, let's say

01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:58.080
I have a problem where I am
looking at an object that

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:03.220
is on an infall trajectory.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:11.580
There is a momentum p
that is describing this.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.040
And it's moving in such
a way-- it's not moving

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.140
on a real trajectory, right?

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:21.900
It's actually moving
in a sense that

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:28.170
is a little bit off of true
to the radial direction.

01:01:28.170 --> 01:01:34.560
This guy actually has an angular
momentum that is given by--

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:38.360
let's say that this
is equal to px x hat.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:41.430
Let's say this is b y hat.

01:01:41.430 --> 01:01:52.488
This guy's got an angular
momentum of b cross p.

01:01:52.488 --> 01:01:54.780
That's the impact parameter
associated with this thing.

01:01:54.780 --> 01:02:02.670
It sort of tells me about
the offset of this momentum

01:02:02.670 --> 01:02:05.780
from being directly
radial towards the center

01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:06.405
of this object.

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.680
Well, I'm going to
use a similar notion

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:21.280
to give me a geometric sense of
what this impact parameter here

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.270
means.

01:02:22.270 --> 01:02:25.810
Suppose here is my black hole.

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:29.860
It's a little circle
of radius 2GM.

01:02:29.860 --> 01:02:34.353
And I'm sitting way the heck
out here, safely far away

01:02:34.353 --> 01:02:35.020
from this thing.

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:43.890
And what I'm going to
do is shoot light--

01:02:43.890 --> 01:02:45.065
not quite radial.

01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:46.440
What I'm going to
do is I'm going

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:50.990
to have sort of an
array of laser beams

01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:53.630
that kind of come up here--

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.300
an array of laser beams.

01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:03.650
And I'm going to shoot them
towards this black hole.

01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:06.540
And what I'm going to do is I'm
going to offset the laser beams

01:03:06.540 --> 01:03:07.860
by a distance b.

01:03:10.272 --> 01:03:12.480
And I'm going to fire it
straight towards this thing.

01:03:16.012 --> 01:03:17.970
Go through sort of a
careful definition of what

01:03:17.970 --> 01:03:19.560
angular momentum
means, and you'll

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.700
see that that definition
of impact parameter

01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:27.750
gives you a very nice sense
of the energy associated

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:31.050
with the trajectory of this
beam and a notion of angular

01:03:31.050 --> 01:03:34.470
momentum associated with this.

01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:37.230
So let's flip back and
forth between a couple

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.960
of different boards here.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.383
There are three cases
that are interesting.

01:03:53.010 --> 01:03:56.538
Suppose b is small.

01:03:56.538 --> 01:04:04.560
In particular, suppose I
have b less than 3 root 3 GM.

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:08.185
So I start over here.

01:04:08.185 --> 01:04:09.060
Let's take the limit.

01:04:09.060 --> 01:04:10.200
What if b equals 0?

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.560
Well, if b equals 0,
this guy just goes, zoom,

01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:16.100
straight into the black hole.

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:21.570
As long as it is anything
less than 3 root 3 GM,

01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:24.740
what will happen is, when
I shoot this thing in,

01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:26.810
it goes in, and
it bends, perhaps,

01:04:26.810 --> 01:04:29.360
but it ends up going
into the black hole.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:36.758
Let's look at this
in the context

01:04:36.758 --> 01:04:48.510
of the equation of motion,
the potential, and the impact

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.370
parameter.

01:04:50.370 --> 01:04:58.310
If b is less than 1 over 3 root
3 GM, then 1 over b squared

01:04:58.310 --> 01:05:00.530
will be higher than this peak.

01:05:00.530 --> 01:05:02.290
And this thing is
just going to be,

01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:03.832
whoo [fast motion
sound effect], it's

01:05:03.832 --> 01:05:05.740
going to go right over
the top of the peak.

01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:07.145
And it shoots into small radius.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:17.840
OK.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.990
Remember, L and E are
constants of the motion.

01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:23.680
So that b is a parameter
that defines this light

01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:25.300
for the this entire trajectory.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.820
1 over b squared is less
than V phot everywhere--

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:33.535
excuse me, greater
than V phot everywhere.

01:05:33.535 --> 01:05:35.580
A rather crucial typo.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.560
And as such, it
shoots the light ray,

01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:50.020
and it goes right over the
peak into the black hole,

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:51.730
eventually winds
up at r equals 0.

01:05:54.780 --> 01:06:06.880
If b is greater than 3 root
3 GM, then 1 over b squared

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:11.920
is less than V phot at the peak.

01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:19.970
This corresponds,
in this drawing,

01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:23.600
to a beam of light that follows
a trajectory that kind of comes

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.310
in here at this point.

01:06:27.310 --> 01:06:31.790
dr d tau, if we were to continue
to go into smaller radii,

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:33.530
it would become imaginary.

01:06:33.530 --> 01:06:34.760
That's not allowed.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.430
So it switches direction
and trundles right back

01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:38.621
out to infinity.

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:50.840
On this diagram, that
corresponds to a light ray

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:51.860
that's perhaps out here.

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:54.890
This guy comes in, and he
gets bent by the gravity

01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:57.348
a little bit, and then just,
shoo [light ray sound effect],

01:06:57.348 --> 01:06:58.910
shoots back off to infinity.

01:06:58.910 --> 01:07:14.770
The critical point,
b equals 3 GM,

01:07:14.770 --> 01:07:18.090
is right where the impact
parameter hits the peak.

01:07:22.070 --> 01:07:40.060
And so what happens in this
plot is this guy comes in,

01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:43.350
hits the peak, and just
sits there forever.

01:07:48.745 --> 01:07:50.620
You get a little bit
more of a physical sense

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:53.230
as to what's going on by
thinking about it here.

01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:00.990
This guy comes in,
[INAUDIBLE] this,

01:08:00.990 --> 01:08:06.670
and then just whirls
around, and lies on what

01:08:06.670 --> 01:08:09.070
we call the photon orbit.

01:08:09.070 --> 01:08:11.320
What's the radius of
that photon orbit?

01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:12.865
r equals 3 GM.

01:08:25.979 --> 01:08:30.270
Now, astrophysically, a
more interesting situation

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:33.420
is, imagine you had some
source of light that

01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:37.359
dumps a lot of photons in
the vicinity of a black hole.

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:40.380
Some of those photons
are going to tend to--

01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.460
some of them are going to
go into the black hole,

01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:44.043
some are going to
scatter a little bit

01:08:44.043 --> 01:08:45.453
and shoot off to infinity.

01:08:45.453 --> 01:08:46.870
But if you imagine
that there will

01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:49.210
be some population of
them that get stuck

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:53.470
right on the r
equals 3GM orbit--

01:08:53.470 --> 01:08:56.000
now, that is an unstable orbit.

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.390
And in fact, if you look at
it, what you find is that

01:08:58.390 --> 01:09:04.479
your typical photon is likely to
whirl around a bunch of times,

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:07.420
and then, you know, if
it's not precisely at 3GM

01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:14.859
but it's 3.00000000000000001GM,
it will whirl around maybe 10

01:09:14.859 --> 01:09:19.107
or 15 times, and then
it'll go off to infinity.

01:09:19.107 --> 01:09:21.399
So what we actually expect
is if we have an object that

01:09:21.399 --> 01:09:24.550
is illuminated
like this, then we

01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:27.069
will actually see these
things come out here,

01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:28.960
and we will see--

01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:32.779
so bear in mind, this is
circularly-- this is symmetric.

01:09:32.779 --> 01:09:38.729
So take this and rotate
around the symmetry axis.

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:47.850
We expect to see a ring
whose radius is twice

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.229
the critical impact parameter.

01:09:50.229 --> 01:09:54.229
So it would have a
diameter of 6 root 3 GM.

01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:58.680
It would be essentially a ring
or a circle of radius 3 root 3

01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.880
GM.

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:04.560
This is, in fact, what the Event
Horizon Telescope measured.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.020
So last year when I was
lecturing this class,

01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:09.390
this was announced almost--

01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:10.950
I mean, they timed it well.

01:10:10.950 --> 01:10:13.920
They basically timed it to
about two or three lectures

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:18.598
before I discussed this
aspect of black holes.

01:10:18.598 --> 01:10:20.640
So that was-- thank you,
Event Horizon Telescope.

01:10:20.640 --> 01:10:23.620
That was very nice of them.

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:28.350
And of course, we don't expect--
so Schwarzschild black holes

01:10:28.350 --> 01:10:31.410
are probably a
mathematical curiosity.

01:10:31.410 --> 01:10:33.600
Objects in the real
universe all rotate.

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.330
We expect Kerr to be
the generic solution.

01:10:36.330 --> 01:10:37.830
And so there's a
fair amount of work

01:10:37.830 --> 01:10:40.460
that goes into how you
correct this to do--

01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:42.030
so doing this for
Schwarzschild is,

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.613
because of spherical symmetry,
it's beautiful and it's simple.

01:10:44.613 --> 01:10:46.440
Kerr is a little bit
more complicated.

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.960
But, you know, it's a
problem that can be solved.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.570
And a lot of very smart
people spend a lot of time

01:10:51.570 --> 01:10:53.340
doing this to sort
of map out what

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:56.640
the shadow of the
black hole looks like,

01:10:56.640 --> 01:11:00.030
what this ring would look
like in the case of light

01:11:00.030 --> 01:11:04.230
coming off of a
spinning black hole.

01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:05.360
So that's it.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:09.290
This is all that I'm
going to present for 8.962

01:11:09.290 --> 01:11:11.690
in the spring of 2020 semester.

01:11:11.690 --> 01:11:15.320
So to everyone, as
you are scattered

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:20.300
around the world attempting
to sort of stay connected

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:24.080
to physics and your
friends and your classwork,

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:25.250
I wish you good health.

01:11:25.250 --> 01:11:28.550
And I hope to see you again
at a time when the world is

01:11:28.550 --> 01:11:29.930
a little less crazy.

01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:34.480
In the meantime, enjoy our
little beautiful black holes.

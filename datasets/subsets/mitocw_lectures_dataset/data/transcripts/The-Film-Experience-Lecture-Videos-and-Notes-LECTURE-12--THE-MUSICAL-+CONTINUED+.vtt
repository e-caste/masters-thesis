DAVID THORBURN: I want
to continue our discourse

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.840
about musicals, especially
as a way of trying

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.640
to lead into the two remarkable,
in many ways landmark films

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.090
we're going to
juxtapose this evening.

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.190
Remember that our plan
here is to juxtapose

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.540
one film-- a classic instance,
even a culminating instance

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.950
of the studio era
and of the tradition

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.640
of the musical in
the studio era--

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.360
against another
kind of musical that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.190
appears after the
advent of television,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.620
and after the studio
system has begun

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.630
to break apart, and especially
after the fundamental

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.830
transformation that the
audience underwent, migrating

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.850
from an habitual, a regular,
a weekly relationship

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.830
to Hollywood films,
to essentially

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.124
a blockbuster relationship,
in which the vast majority

00:01:15.124 --> 00:01:17.040
of Americans would attend
the movies only once

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.580
or twice a year.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.770
And if you think about
the implications of that,

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.720
that fact alone will explain how
profoundly the movie industry

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.589
was transformed.

00:01:26.589 --> 00:01:28.130
Incidentally, I
should mention to you

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.000
that this is still not an idea
that has been fully understood

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.190
by what I'll call traditional
film historians, who

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.690
are so locked into an idea
that film must resemble

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.780
the kind of thing that I
watched when I grew up as a boy,

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.280
or as a young girl.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.420
And now that a
tradition of scholarship

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.060
has talked about,
that is to say,

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.340
those films that never
were shown on television,

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.900
or were never made
for television,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.910
it causes a problem.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.080
Because what these
scholars tend to do is they

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.110
ignore the social
context within which

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.100
the function of the movies
began to be transformed.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.230
Partly there was a
kind of hostility

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.420
on the part of many older film
scholars toward the notion

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.910
that television might
be a worthy place

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.490
to look for a valuable
cinematic narrative.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.950
And it took a long time
before the community

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.070
of film scholars--
even a part of it--

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.210
was ready to acknowledge
that television was also

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.030
an environment in which cinema--
what we might call cinema

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.650
audiovisual narrative--
could be look

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.292
at, taken seriously,
and so forth.

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:39.750
And of course,
today it's taken for

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.610
granted by many
commentators, many of them

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.826
no longer even with a cultural
memory of the studio era,

00:02:46.826 --> 00:02:48.200
that what goes on
on television--

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.950
that shows like Breaking
Bad or The Sopranos

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.510
are the supreme forms of
audiovisual entertainment

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.480
in our society.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.400
This too is radically
oversimplified.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.150
And I will return
to these questions

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.060
a bit later when I talk about
the Westerns, and about film

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.820
in the '70s, in two weeks.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.020
I want to continue our discourse
about the musical then, first

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.610
by giving you a very brief
prospective drawn from the film

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.240
scholar Leo Braudy, whose essay
"The Aesthetics of Connection"

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.730
is required reading I think
for this week-- in any case,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.212
for this week or next week.

00:03:29.212 --> 00:03:31.170
And he talks in that
essay, among other things,

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.191
very richly about the
musical, and about ways

00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:35.440
of thinking about the musical.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.170
And I'm borrowing
from an argument he

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.760
makes in that remarkable essay.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.400
He makes a distinction
in that essay,

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.950
or a series of comparisons
between Astaire and Kelly,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.560
the two great male
leads we associate

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.450
with the American film musical.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.190
And he sees them very helpfully
as contrasting figures

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.740
illustrating what we might
call contrasting elements,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.830
or contrasting tendencies
within the musical form.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.690
If you think about
Astaire-- and you saw him

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.500
in one of his
classic performances

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:10.360
at the end of our last lecture,
in that sequence "Cheek

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.760
to Cheek," if you think
about Astaire in this way,

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.029
from that sequence
you can get something

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.470
of what Braudy had in mind.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.280
He reminds us that Astaire
almost always dances-- and this

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.870
is a partial exception in
the film you saw tonight--

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.810
only a partial one.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.380
But almost always we
see Astaire dancing

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.640
in places that seem
intended for performance.

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.010
That is to say we
won't see Astaire

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.600
dancing in the middle
of a corn field,

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.610
or dancing up the side of
the Empire State Building,

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.850
as Frank Sinatra and Gene
Kelly do in a musical-- it's

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.040
called On the Town.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.610
And it's one of the
wonderful MGM musicals.

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.140
Kelly and Sinatra are
dancing in spaces that

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.690
are inappropriate for dance.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.790
But almost all of
Astaire's dances

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:07.750
take place either in
literal performance spaces

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:09.690
or in public
environments that seem

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.610
as if they're quasi-stage
or dance environments.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:16.500
In other words, he
dances in spaces

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.880
that we expect for dance.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.090
And he doesn't violate
those spaces in some way.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.540
He often in his films plays
either a professional dancer,

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.040
or a professional
performer of some kind.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.580
So when he segues
into his performances,

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.680
there's a kind of
natural connection.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.970
He's almost always
very fancily dressed,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.590
as you saw in
tonight's sequence,

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.260
sometimes very often
dancing in a tux and tails.

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.470
But in any case, in
formal dress of some kind.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:47.290
So he dances in space is
appropriate for dance,

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:51.470
dressed up in a
kind of formal way,

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:55.580
often playing a professional
dancer or a performer.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.260
But there's an immense grace
and energy in his dancing.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:02.697
He's one of the
great dancers-- many

00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:04.280
would say the greatest
dancer who ever

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.430
performed in American movies.

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.060
And one way to talk about the
attractions of what he's doing

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.980
is we can say that
what he embodies

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:15.510
is the principle of
grace under constraint,

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:17.321
like a great baseball pitcher.

00:06:17.321 --> 00:06:17.820
Look.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:20.670
A lot of people can throw
the ball 97 miles an hour.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.520
But only a very small
number of pitchers

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.580
who make a lot of money can
throw a ball 97 miles an hour

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.360
and control where it goes.

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.220
And we can say that that kind
of athletic power-- a lot

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.860
of athletics
involves this, where

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.770
you're trying to control
tremendous physical energy.

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.760
And the physical energy has to
be constrained in certain ways.

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.780
And part of what we admire
about the expression

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.365
of that physical energy is
how constrained or graceful

00:06:47.365 --> 00:06:49.070
it can become.

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.900
There are many
people who have made

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.720
analogies between
Astaire's dancing

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.240
and what great
basketball players do,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.030
showing tremendous
physical energy,

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:02.430
but also a kind of gracefulness
within the constraints

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.800
that are imposed upon them
by the lines on the court,

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:09.070
by the demands of the basket,
by the claims of gravity when

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:10.640
they jump, and so forth.

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.990
And I make allusion to
these non-dance analogies,

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:16.900
because so many people
seem to respond more fully

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.930
to those than to dance itself,
even though those of you who

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.960
have danced, or are dancers,
or know serious dancers,

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:25.680
will understand that
dancers themselves

00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.010
are much greater athletes
than most athletes,

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:31.370
and that there is a profound
form of athleticism,

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.021
of physical energy, grace,
and physical control involved

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:35.520
in dance.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.270
And we see that in
Astaire's performances.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:42.460
It's as if he stands for a
form of grace under constraint,

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:49.750
of strength and power
constrained but not undermined

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:53.510
by the rules and boundaries
within which it must operate.

00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:55.680
It's a form of classical art.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:00.800
And what we can say is that
Kelly stands for classicism.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:01.570
I'm sorry.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:06.360
Astaire stands for
classicism, and Gene Kelly,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.120
who is a kind of opposite
in this way in his dances,

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:10.990
stands for the romantic.

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:14.290
The classic and the romantic
tendencies or energies.

00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:16.430
I'm oversimplifying
here, as Braudy does.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.930
But again, it's a useful and
illuminating simplification.

00:08:19.930 --> 00:08:21.610
Because we see
Kelly for example,

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.020
mostly he doesn't play
professional performers,

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.410
or professional dancers.

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.930
He almost always wears
ordinary casual clothing--

00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:30.905
open shirts, jeans.

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.669
And this casualness
of appearance

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:40.789
is matched by the fact that
the dances he engages in often

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.840
take place in spaces that are
not appropriate for dance,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.500
or almost hostile to dance.

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.050
And one of the
deepest principles

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.830
of Kelly's performances--
of Kelly's dances--

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:54.950
in a certain sense is this
contest between his exuberance

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:58.990
and energy, and the
constraints that surround him.

00:08:58.990 --> 00:09:03.770
But unlike Astaire, he does
not reveal the power and grace

00:09:03.770 --> 00:09:06.490
of his dance by
acknowledging the constraints

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:07.980
and living within them.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:10.470
The energy of his
dance expresses itself

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:15.150
in the moments when he over-goes
boundaries, when he violates

00:09:15.150 --> 00:09:16.880
borders of various kinds.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:21.270
And there are numerous examples
of this in Singin' in the Rain.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:24.450
I'll mention some of
them in a little while.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.070
So the contrast between
Kelly and Astaire

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.070
in this way-- and
look, in both cases

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.580
I've simplified, because
they also resemble each other

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:34.380
in certain ways.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:37.120
But these tendencies
distill quality.

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.690
This argument distills
qualities in them

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.290
that clarify certain
energies or tensions that

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.620
can be said to be
characteristic,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:47.990
not only of two dance styles
and the kinds of movies

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:51.350
these two stars are in, but
also in the musical genre

00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:53.334
as a whole.

00:09:53.334 --> 00:09:54.750
I'd like to say a
couple of things

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:56.200
about each of the
two films we're

00:09:56.200 --> 00:10:00.860
going to see tonight,
by way of framing

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:06.070
some of the most important
issues for you to think about.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.345
And these are very
rich, complex texts.

00:10:09.345 --> 00:10:12.800
And 20 minutes of conversation,
no matter how pointed,

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.540
can never do full
justice to them.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:16.800
I don't intend to do
full justice to them.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:19.120
But I want to suggest
some ways for you

00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:22.530
to think about aspects of these
films as you're viewing them.

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:25.100
And my hope and expectation
is that these perspectives

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.950
will energize and
enliven the film for you,

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:31.290
and cue you in to
aspects of the film

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:33.480
that you might otherwise
not see as deeply,

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.430
or might not occur to you
until you reflected on the film

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.890
after the case.

00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:39.740
One way to think about
Singin' in the Rain,

00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:46.220
then-- our example of
a Hollywood musical,

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.660
or a culminating instance
of a Hollywood musical--

00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.330
is to recognize that it belongs
to a subcategory of musicals--

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:54.730
to several subcategories
of musicals, one of which

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:57.630
I've already mentioned--
the putting on the show,

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.770
the backstage story.

00:10:58.770 --> 00:11:00.830
But here the backstage
story is the story

00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.510
of a movie, instead of a play.

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:08.260
But it's the same
basic situation.

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:12.120
But it is also sometimes
called a song catalog

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:14.560
movie, because there's
so many songs in it.

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:16.300
And that's kind of
a kind of catalog,

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:21.760
or an encyclopedic object.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:26.320
An encyclopedia of film,
of music, and of song.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:30.600
And this is almost literally
true of Singin' in the Rain.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.530
Arthur Freed, the
executive producer

00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:39.040
of so many major films--
over 40 MGM musicals

00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:44.690
between something
like 1939-- what

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.240
was the great musical in 1939?

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.630
The Wizard of Oz-- the first
musical that is thought

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:52.770
to be a musical in color.

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.680
And think how organically
The Wizard of Oz uses color.

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.200
Arthur Freed was the executive
producer of that film.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.900
From that point until
sometime in the 1960s,

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.970
he was the executive
producer or the supervisor

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:06.880
of something like
40-plus MGM musicals,

00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:10.980
of which Singin' in the
Rain is a classic instance.

00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:14.790
And so Freed had
worked as a lyricist.

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:18.090
Arthur Freed had worked
as a lyricist at MGM

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:22.300
with Nacio Herb Brown--
the songwriter--

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.530
many years earlier.

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:27.810
And most of the songs in
Singin' in the Rain, 1952,

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.490
had been introduced in
MGM musicals from 1929 on.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.380
So in a literal sense,
the film is a kind

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:38.010
of encyclopedia of older songs.

00:12:38.010 --> 00:12:41.890
And especially two key songs
in the film-- "Broadway Melody"

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:45.210
and "You Were Meant for
Me," were both featured

00:12:45.210 --> 00:12:50.790
in that early and
signature musical,

00:12:50.790 --> 00:12:53.640
founding musical that I
mentioned this afternoon,

00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.890
The Broadway Melody of 1929.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:58.950
So part of the pleasure
for older members

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:01.580
of the audience
in 1952 would have

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.920
been to hear and
see these numbers

00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.580
in the new, souped-up
arrangements that

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:12.110
were created for this film, and
in such artful performances.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:15.470
There's one song in the film
that my colleague Martin

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:19.010
Marks-- M-A-R-K-S-- he
sometimes teaches this course

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.230
in the spring.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.920
He's a professor of music.

00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:24.950
And he sometimes-- and
I encourage all of you

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:28.280
to consider taking it--
teaches an advanced course

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:29.977
in the American musical.

00:13:29.977 --> 00:13:31.560
It's a wonderfully
interesting course.

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.059
And he knows more
about the musical,

00:13:33.059 --> 00:13:35.700
I think, than almost
any living human being.

00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.910
And I'm stealing from
some of his teaching notes

00:13:37.910 --> 00:13:39.590
here when I say this.

00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:42.410
One song that Marty
Marks loves to talk about

00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:44.980
is a minor song in the film.

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.510
And I'm mentioning it because
you might miss it otherwise.

00:13:47.510 --> 00:13:49.000
It's called "Would You?"

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:54.020
And it's a song that chose
the process of dubbing.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:58.920
And it's a song that actually
has a kind of a plot,

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.270
and historical function
within the film.

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.160
It comes near the
end of the film.

00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.620
And when it was
sung in this moment,

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:09.170
it was already old-fashioned
in its original day,

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:13.150
when it was first
written and sung.

00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:16.300
And by 1952 it's
much more outmoded,

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.410
Professor Marks tells us.

00:14:19.410 --> 00:14:21.730
Although it's a simple
and graceful waltz,

00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:24.930
it uses an antiquated
diction, for example.

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:27.360
And there are other
signals-- even the fact

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.040
that it's a waltz--
that show it to be

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.920
kind of old-fashioned in a way.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:34.170
But in Singin' in the Rain,
this old-fashioned song

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:37.720
is used to telescope
the process of recording

00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.140
for films shot-by-shot.

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.060
Watch how it happens.

00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:42.330
It's a very exciting moment.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:49.000
And so what happens then is
that the old-fashioned song

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.940
becomes the cornerstone
of the new technology

00:14:51.940 --> 00:14:53.160
of sound recording.

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.930
Watch how it
happens in the film.

00:14:54.930 --> 00:14:56.510
And what this calls
our attention to

00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:00.950
is something I've
talked about earlier,

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:04.560
and will return to in a moment--
the idea that in the most

00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.854
remarkable works of art we
are surely aware of the fact

00:15:07.854 --> 00:15:09.270
that we're in the
presence of what

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:11.520
the literary critics
and the art critics

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:16.210
sometimes call organic form,
in which the form of the text

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:19.300
contributes to its meaning,
in which form and content are

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:22.740
married, can't
really be separated.

00:15:22.740 --> 00:15:25.250
That the formal
behavior of the text

00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:29.250
enacts or embodies or
articulates or dramatizes

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:31.970
what the film is about,
what the text means.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.660
I'll come back to this point
in a minute with even more

00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:39.960
dramatic examples, I hope.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:42.540
And an added point
about this "Would You?"

00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:45.707
song, just this one
sort of minor sequence--

00:15:45.707 --> 00:15:47.290
I'm mentioning this
partly to show you

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.680
how deeply you
could actually dig

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.260
into particular sequences and
particular songs in the film,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:56.000
and find meaning, relevance,
and complexity there.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.790
When Debbie Reynolds,
who sings the song,

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:01.290
looks point blank at Gene
Kelly as she sings it,

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:04.790
she drives home the question of
whether he'll be brave enough

00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:08.290
to love her, So it
even implicates itself

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.710
in the love story that's
at the heart of the film.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:16.430
Her singing voice, we might
note ironically and comically,

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:19.040
in this scene is actually
dubbed for this song.

00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.540
And you'll understand
if you haven't

00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.730
seen the film why that's a
comic and ironic commentary.

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.370
She had the wrong kind of voice.

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:28.820
It was too flat and nasal for
this operetta-like number.

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.536
So they dubbed her voice.

00:16:30.536 --> 00:16:32.410
So there's a double
irony here, because she's

00:16:32.410 --> 00:16:35.320
playing a dubber when
she's singing the song.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.110
And you might compare the
voice in "Good Morning,"

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.290
another number in the film,
where Debbie Reynolds is really

00:16:41.290 --> 00:16:42.160
singing.

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.400
And you can see the difference
between the two voices.

00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:53.470
So the implicit
point that I made

00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:56.570
in talking about
this one number,

00:16:56.570 --> 00:16:59.560
the "Would You?"
song number, it has

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.450
to do with what we might
call a central element

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:04.550
or feature of
Singin' in the Rain,

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.880
its profound self-consciousness,
the profound way in which it

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:13.849
shows itself to be aware of
itself-- to be aware of itself

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:15.819
as a movie, to be
aware of itself

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:19.450
as a bearer of
traditions of singing,

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.880
of dancing, and performance.

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:26.250
And so it isn't
simply an encyclopedia

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.760
of musical history.

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.610
It's almost an encyclopedia
of almost all forms

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.300
of performance.

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:33.760
I don't want to go too far.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.230
But there's many, many
forms of performance

00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:41.750
are incorporated in the film's
grasp, in the film's embrace.

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:43.230
All right?

00:17:43.230 --> 00:17:47.110
One way we can think of it as
an encyclopedic recapitulation

00:17:47.110 --> 00:17:52.200
of the history of musicals,
and of films in general.

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.780
As you'll notice when you
look at the film, Singin'

00:17:55.780 --> 00:18:01.870
in the Rain begins by being
about the problem of changing

00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:06.400
a silent film into a sound film,
because the silent has been

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:10.310
made just at that cusp moment
when the transition to sound

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.950
is occurring.

00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:12.840
And the film in
that sense is also

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.520
a wonderful sort of historical
reprise for our course,

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.660
even though it wasn't made
for that purpose, alas.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.620
So in the film,
then, we also get

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.780
an allusion to and
a representation

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:28.370
of silent movies.

00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.720
But not just some generic
idea of silent movies--

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:35.750
a very particular kind of
swashbuckler adventure film

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:37.550
is dramatized there.

00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.670
But then later, in a scene
I mentioned earlier today,

00:18:40.670 --> 00:18:43.270
in the audition scene,
the beautiful girls

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.940
sequence in Singin' in the
Rain where a megaphone suddenly

00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:50.240
turns into a circle of dancers,
alluding to the Busby Berkeley

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:54.010
tradition, we have a
very specific reference

00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:57.220
to another kind
of movie musical.

00:18:57.220 --> 00:18:59.050
So, juxtaposed
against each other

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:01.160
are two different
kinds of movies,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.530
And I've only mentioned
a couple of examples.

00:19:03.530 --> 00:19:05.920
As you watch the film,
you'll see dozens and dozens

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:09.930
of instances in which the
film capaciously reaches back

00:19:09.930 --> 00:19:12.570
to older forms of performance,
and tries to incorporate them

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:14.780
in some sense into
its own structure,

00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:16.980
into its own energies.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:19.410
And there are many older
performance forms in the film.

00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:23.550
There are forms of slapstick,
and Keaton-like comedy--

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:27.030
especially in Donald O'Connor's
wonderful dance and song

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:28.880
sequence "Make 'em Laugh."

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:30.900
There are allusions
and references

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:33.010
and dramatized scenes
from vaudeville,

00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:35.325
from jazz, from
what we might call

00:19:35.325 --> 00:19:38.930
forms of love melodrama, all
the way through the film.

00:19:38.930 --> 00:19:44.410
And I haven't really
cataloged even remotely

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:49.610
all the kinds of performance
spaces and performance types

00:19:49.610 --> 00:19:51.700
that the film
incorporates and utilizes

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:54.760
in the course of its length.

00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.740
Nor have I even begun to list
the number of musical styles--

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:03.160
particular songs and particular
dance styles-- that are also

00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.640
incorporated into the film.

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:08.010
But I've said enough to suggest
that Singin' in the Rain

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:10.270
has what might be
called a structural

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:15.140
or a formal exuberance,
a kind of excitement,

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.180
as if every time
it turns it wants

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:20.420
to make an allusion to
another kind of text,

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:23.680
as if it feels itself in some
sense with a kind of excitement

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.720
and exuberant energy constantly
in touch with its ancestry,

00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.980
and within ancestry that it
tries to define very generously

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:31.930
and broadly.

00:20:31.930 --> 00:20:34.390
And so what we're
saying is that formally,

00:20:34.390 --> 00:20:38.030
structurally, the
film is expressing

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:43.040
a special kind of intellectual
energy, excitement, exuberance.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.710
And of course what's interesting
and fundamental about that

00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.190
is that those energies
are also replicated,

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:54.180
centrally reenacted in
the actual dance sequences

00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:58.860
that we see in the film.

00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:02.760
It's a profoundly rich example
of what I called a moment ago

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.410
organic form.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:06.910
The structure or the
shape of the film

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:09.110
contributes to
our sense not only

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.150
that it has a kind of
encyclopedic, self-reflexive

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.600
interest in its own
history, and that it's

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.100
recapitulating its own
history for us as it proceeds.

00:21:19.100 --> 00:21:23.920
We also have a deep sense of
the extent to which the film

00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:27.590
understands that many of the
older forms it dramatizes

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:31.360
are now simply being archived,
as if the film understands

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:36.350
itself not only as a
dramatic entertainment,

00:21:36.350 --> 00:21:38.280
but also as a kind
of history book,

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.600
or a kind of encyclopedia--
literally a kind

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:45.270
of archive of all the forms of
performance and song and dance

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.480
that lie behind the
making of such a film.

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.190
And of course that this
formal exuberance, as I said,

00:21:51.190 --> 00:21:56.030
is repeated again and again in
an actualized and concrete way

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.190
in the story, in
the plot, every time

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:00.330
the characters start
singing or dancing.

00:22:00.330 --> 00:22:02.370
And as you'll see,
there's a particular kind

00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:06.720
of exuberance and energy
in many of the dances.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.470
Key themes.

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:10.120
Well I've already implicitly
been talking about some

00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.520
of the themes.

00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.220
But let me mention just
two that seem to me

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.540
especially significant.

00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:19.210
One I've mentioned much earlier.

00:22:19.210 --> 00:22:21.050
And I simply want
to remind you again

00:22:21.050 --> 00:22:23.880
that this tension between
what might be called high art,

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.760
and the pretentious expectations
of a cultural establishment,

00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.890
are set up for parody
and mockery in this film

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:31.690
repeatedly.

00:22:31.690 --> 00:22:36.360
The film is on the side of
the popular and the energetic,

00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.890
and the unpretentious.

00:22:39.890 --> 00:22:43.300
And one can feel that
tension again and again

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.410
in many, many of the sequences
in the movie in the film.

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.150
Let me give you just
two obvious examples.

00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:56.960
In the very opening
sequence of the film,

00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:00.090
one of the classic moments in
the history of American movies

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:04.020
replayed again and again
in compilation anthologies

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.750
of great moments in Hollywood,
great moments of Hollywood

00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:09.940
film, is the
introduction to the film.

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:13.030
And the introduction
to Singin' in the Rain

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:17.220
recreates an
historical actuality

00:23:17.220 --> 00:23:19.480
that I need to remind
today's audiences of.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:21.210
Shows you how old
this course is.

00:23:21.210 --> 00:23:23.480
Because when I first began
to teach this course,

00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.280
these practices
were still going on,

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:27.830
and the students
still understood,

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:30.830
and in fact had their own
experience of exhibition

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:38.280
movies, and of going to
theaters that were very lavish

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.277
and, in many ways,
even pretentious.

00:23:43.277 --> 00:23:44.860
And what they were
especially aware of

00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:46.050
is something I
have to remind you

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:47.800
of now, which is that
very often Hollywood

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.830
had a strategy of rolling
out its great blockbuster,

00:23:50.830 --> 00:23:52.970
what it hoped would be
great blockbuster films,

00:23:52.970 --> 00:23:57.600
with very elaborate
inaugural events.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.060
The debut of a film was
often a major event.

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:01.960
And it would be
covered by newspapers.

00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:06.200
And many Hollywood stars
would come and attend.

00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:09.310
And they would turn the
event into a publicity event

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:13.640
partly in order to get publicity
for the release of the film.

00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.590
And Singin' in the Rain
opens with such a moment,

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:19.130
in which a film is opening.

00:24:19.130 --> 00:24:25.330
And it dramatizes the
comic hypocrisies that

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:29.190
attend such publicity gestures.

00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:33.210
And as the film opens
then, we see a sequence

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:38.680
in which the stars of the film
we're about to see, Gene Kelly,

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.430
is interviewed.

00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.500
The star of the film is
interviewed by a reporter.

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.850
And he then tells sort of
the story of his career.

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:49.774
But the story that he
tells is fake-- is a lie.

00:24:49.774 --> 00:24:50.690
It's very pretentious.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:54.200
Oh, we went to the
best conservatories.

00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.190
We were trained by classical
musicians and classical

00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.440
actors-- "ac-TORS."

00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:00.760
And he acts very pretentious.

00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.120
But that's what he says.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:04.270
But what we see,
what is shown to us

00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:08.930
is the actual history of how
Don Lockwood and his partner,

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:13.090
his sidekick, played by the
brilliant performer Donald

00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:15.920
O'Connor, really
got their start.

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.710
And so while he
says, we were trained

00:25:17.710 --> 00:25:20.060
in the best
conservatories, what we

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:23.650
see are Donald O'Connor
and Gene Kelly dancing

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:24.970
in a burlesque show.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:29.150
And so that there's this very
obvious, even in some ways

00:25:29.150 --> 00:25:35.060
crude mockery or laughter at
the hypocrisies of Hollywood.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.900
And part of what's
being celebrated

00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:41.580
there is the exuberance and
energy, of unsanctioned forms

00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:44.220
of performance, like
the dances that people

00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:48.240
do in burlesque shows, as
against what you do when you go

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.460
to the museum, or when
you come to the university

00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:54.240
and have your professor
declaim ancient Greek to you

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:57.090
in syllables you have
no understanding of.

00:25:57.090 --> 00:26:00.800
So there's one example of
how that theme plays out.

00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.930
But you can find it
in dozens and dozens

00:26:02.930 --> 00:26:04.320
of other places in the film.

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:09.710
And I hope you'll
watch for such moments.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:11.410
So I won't give you
my second example.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:12.740
I'm running out of time.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:15.900
Let me turn to the
next large theme

00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.220
I want you to be aware of.

00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:19.230
I call it the theme
of outer versus inner.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:24.980
It's really a variation
on or an extension

00:26:24.980 --> 00:26:27.800
of the theme of high versus
popular art, in the sense

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.240
that it's also about the
difference between a kind

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:34.940
of pretentious and constraining
and old-fashioned view

00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:38.870
of things, and a
more spontaneous

00:26:38.870 --> 00:26:42.840
and we might even say
a more spontaneous

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:47.134
and popular or democratic
view of things.

00:26:47.134 --> 00:26:48.800
And the term I give
it is the difference

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.730
between outer and inner, or the
difference between appearance

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:52.710
and reality.

00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:55.120
And in fact the example
I just gave you,

00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:57.830
in which we have Don Lockwood
telling the reporter that he

00:26:57.830 --> 00:27:00.380
was educated in the
best conservatories

00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.790
while we see that he's
dancing in a burlesque show,

00:27:03.790 --> 00:27:06.020
is an example of that
kind of thing as well.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.520
But there are many other
very dramatic examples.

00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:13.320
And I want to mention
one of them now.

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.880
When the Debbie Reynolds
character-- the love interest

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.510
of our protagonist-- first meets
the Don Lockwood character--

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:24.550
the character played
by Gene Kelly--

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:26.780
she pretends not to recognize
him, even though he's

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.340
a famous movie star.

00:27:28.340 --> 00:27:32.260
And she says, oh, she spends
her time watching Shakespeare,

00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:34.980
but she doesn't spend much
time watching the movies.

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.320
And Don Lockwood is kind
of offended by this.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.060
It later turns out-- not
even that much later--

00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:42.240
that of course the
Debbie Reynolds character

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:44.910
herself is deeply immersed
in the popular culture.

00:27:44.910 --> 00:27:47.120
Right after she makes this
comment to Don Lockwood,

00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.890
or a few minutes
after that, we find

00:27:49.890 --> 00:27:55.840
her jumping out of the cake
as a dancer at a party.

00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.800
And then as more
information emerges later,

00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:03.420
we come to recognize, of course,
that she knows a great deal

00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:04.300
about Don Lockwood.

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.730
She's always been a
tremendous fan of the movies.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:08.500
But she's been covering it up.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.070
And again and again
in the film we

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:13.710
see this kind of tension
playing itself out,

00:28:13.710 --> 00:28:18.510
this tension between a
kind of outer facade.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:22.190
And the notion is that what
is shown on the outside,

00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:27.650
the exterior of things is often
fake, a mere cover for what

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:30.310
is authentic and within,
And you can understand

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.640
this in a number of ways.

00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.350
One of the ways it
plays out in the movie

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:36.410
is the question
of the person who

00:28:36.410 --> 00:28:38.080
is in front of the
audience and singing,

00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:39.874
but it's not really her voice.

00:28:39.874 --> 00:28:41.290
It's the voice of
Debbie Reynolds,

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.220
who's behind the curtain.

00:28:43.220 --> 00:28:48.410
And so that again, this
theme of the artificial

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.820
versus the authentic, or
the outer versus the inner,

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.260
plays itself out in many,
many ways in the film.

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.730
That's part of what makes
the film so coherent, so

00:28:58.730 --> 00:29:00.950
dramatically effective
and energetic.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.180
And so another way of
thinking about this sequence,

00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.890
this idea of the outer person
versus the inner, authentic

00:29:09.890 --> 00:29:14.450
person; the outer appearance,
the illusion that film makes,

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.200
but what really goes
on behind the scenes.

00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.430
And as you'll discover,
Singin' in the Rain

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:20.470
constantly takes us
behind the scenes

00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:24.260
to show us how the illusion
of movies is put together.

00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.305
And that's a part
of this same theme.

00:29:26.305 --> 00:29:28.930
So one of the things I'm trying
to call your attention to again

00:29:28.930 --> 00:29:32.350
is the way in which the
central ideas of the film

00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:35.070
permeate both its
form and its content

00:29:35.070 --> 00:29:38.670
in ways that make it very
difficult to separate.

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:41.430
Finally, one last
fundamental issue

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:43.240
connected to what I've
been saying before,

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.360
the way the film
meditates on or dramatizes

00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.480
an idea about the place of
song and dance in human life.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.150
You will have
noticed, of course,

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:55.650
that I myself
feel-- and if you've

00:29:55.650 --> 00:29:57.900
seen any of the
performances in this film,

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.950
you'll know yourselves-- that a
principle of energy, vitality,

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:04.730
playfulness, exuberance
is almost always

00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:07.770
present in the dances
in Singin' in the Rain.

00:30:07.770 --> 00:30:10.720
Song and dance is seen
in Singin' in the Rain

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:14.280
as a morally and psychologically
revolutionary experience,

00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:14.960
I think.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.340
And I use the word "revolution"
in a dangerous way.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.550
I don't mean a politically
revolutionary way,

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:22.531
but I mean in a morally, a
psychologically revolutionary

00:30:22.531 --> 00:30:23.030
way.

00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.960
And so what's going
on in some sense

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.110
is the sense that constraint
and convention are constantly

00:30:29.110 --> 00:30:33.210
threatened by the exuberance,
spontaneity, energy,

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:36.730
excitement, vitality
of the dance.

00:30:36.730 --> 00:30:39.800
And this expresses itself in
all kinds of ways in the film.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.330
Let me just mention a couple
to call your attention to.

00:30:42.330 --> 00:30:45.050
You'll discover many,
many other examples.

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.530
One is the wonderful sequence,
the Moses supposes sequence.

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.760
This is a sequence in which Don
Lockwood and his partner Donald

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:53.800
O'Connor have to be
trained, because they're

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.470
making the transition to sound.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:58.400
And the studio calls
in an elocution expert,

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:02.960
who's dressed up like a very
pretentious old-line professor.

00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:05.690
And he's going to teach them how
to pronounce things correctly.

00:31:05.690 --> 00:31:07.760
So he comes in,
and he says, I want

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:14.230
you to repeat after me-- "Moses
supposes his toses are roses.

00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:19.340
But Moses supposes erroneously."

00:31:19.340 --> 00:31:20.480
He's also ugly.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.390
His teeth are disgusting.

00:31:22.390 --> 00:31:24.170
So you're already
offended by the guy

00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:27.627
before Don and his
comrade begin to respond.

00:31:27.627 --> 00:31:29.710
And also, of course, what's
ridiculous about this?

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.340
It's meaningless talk.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.730
He's so interested in making
them pronounce the "O"

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:38.780
vowel properly that he
creates meaningless sentences.

00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:43.220
But their meaninglessness amuses
Don Lockwood and his partner.

00:31:43.220 --> 00:31:46.850
And essentially what they do
is they take the Moses supposes

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.980
lines, and they begin to
sort of make fun of them.

00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.090
And they begin to make
fun of their interlocutor,

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.950
their teacher.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:57.380
They end up taking a garbage
can and emptying it out

00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.520
just has paper in it--
putting it on his head.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.630
They end up dancing
in a ridiculous way.

00:32:01.630 --> 00:32:04.835
So they end up dancing on top of
desks, or up the side of walls.

00:32:04.835 --> 00:32:05.960
Again, what are they doing?

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.580
Their dances are violating
the normal spaces

00:32:08.580 --> 00:32:11.860
in which we expect people to
be walking or standing upright.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.970
The very way in which the dance
violates normal boundaries

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:18.430
creates this sense of
exuberance and of freedom.

00:32:18.430 --> 00:32:20.180
So what they're doing
is they're rebelling

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:26.420
against the pretentiousness,
the constraints of this kind

00:32:26.420 --> 00:32:29.680
of high-culture expectation.

00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:34.740
And the song and dance in
the Moses supposes sequence

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:37.270
create a kind of
exuberant chaos in which

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:40.200
they dance on the tables and
make fun of the very elements

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.090
that they're supposed
to be learning.

00:32:42.090 --> 00:32:43.590
The "Good Morning"
sequence-- one

00:32:43.590 --> 00:32:46.390
of the great sequences in the
history of movies, I think--

00:32:46.390 --> 00:32:48.250
shows the same thing.

00:32:48.250 --> 00:32:51.300
It takes place at breakfast
in an ordinary domestic space,

00:32:51.300 --> 00:32:53.900
which is transfigured
or transformed,

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:55.670
including the
props, in something

00:32:55.670 --> 00:32:58.890
we might imagine Chaplin
doing such imaginative things,

00:32:58.890 --> 00:33:03.690
in which the ordinary props
of the kitchen become partners

00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.340
in the dance, become elements
in the dance-- what we feel

00:33:06.340 --> 00:33:10.610
is the imaginative power
of love and of performance

00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:13.000
transforming an ordinary space.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.960
And we can see this
principle operating

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:17.860
with an even greater
force in the title

00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.280
sequence of the film-- probably
the most famous sequence

00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.860
of dance in the history
of Hollywood, the Singin'

00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:27.130
in the Rain sequence itself.

00:33:27.130 --> 00:33:28.310
We see the rain itself.

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.180
What a funny place
to be dancing,

00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:31.350
There's a contradiction.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:34.190
But your exuberance, your
energy, your sense of love

00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:36.900
is so great that even
rain doesn't matter.

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.080
And watch what happens.

00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:40.320
He has an umbrella, but he
doesn't use the umbrella

00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.380
to protect him from the rain,
violating our expectation.

00:33:43.380 --> 00:33:45.296
There's one wonderful
moment in the film where

00:33:45.296 --> 00:33:47.410
he hands the umbrella in
the midst of pouring rain

00:33:47.410 --> 00:33:51.537
to someone else, to a
pedestrian who goes by,

00:33:51.537 --> 00:33:53.495
There's a moment when
he's dancing in the rain.

00:33:53.495 --> 00:33:54.660
He puts the umbrella down.

00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.410
The rain's coming.

00:33:55.410 --> 00:33:57.368
But he doesn't have enough
rain pouring on him.

00:33:57.368 --> 00:34:00.510
He steps under a downspout to
have even more rain come down

00:34:00.510 --> 00:34:01.010
on him.

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.330
And when we experience
this, one of the reasons

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:08.100
we experience this as joyful,
and as assertive, and as

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:10.960
individualizing, is
the sense we have

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.670
that these are exactly not
things that people normally do.

00:34:13.670 --> 00:34:16.929
He's over-going or violating
certain conventions

00:34:16.929 --> 00:34:18.389
or literal boundaries.

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:21.520
And there's one moment in
the dance, very dramatic.

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.510
And I know this
incidentally, not

00:34:23.510 --> 00:34:25.000
because I've
discovered it myself,

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.217
but because 20 years ago or
15 years ago in this course

00:34:28.217 --> 00:34:30.300
a student who later went
on to work in Hollywood--

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:31.341
and he still works there.

00:34:31.341 --> 00:34:32.800
He's a sound genius.

00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:35.590
He was an MIT engineer
who loved this course,

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:37.130
and was a musician as well.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:40.929
He wrote a paper for
me about that sequence.

00:34:40.929 --> 00:34:42.120
And he showed me this.

00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.330
And I'm sure that some
smart critics also saw it,

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.980
but I learned this
from an MIT student

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:49.150
in this course
about 15 years ago.

00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:51.392
He analyzed the dance
sequence very closely.

00:34:51.392 --> 00:34:52.850
And one of the
things he showed was

00:34:52.850 --> 00:34:54.639
that the decisive
moment in the dance

00:34:54.639 --> 00:34:58.120
occurs-- or a decisive
moment in the dance

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.480
occurs-- when the Kelly
character suddenly-- he's

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.430
dancing on the
sidewalk-- jumps off

00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.050
the sidewalk across the
curb into the street.

00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:08.979
And psychologically it has a
tremendously profound effect,

00:35:08.979 --> 00:35:10.520
because you don't
walk in the street,

00:35:10.520 --> 00:35:12.080
much less dance in the street.

00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.300
The street is for cars.

00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:17.690
But that violation
of the boundary

00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:19.950
expresses the sense
of exuberance,

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:26.120
of freedom that is the
essential meaning of what

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:28.380
these dances represent.

00:35:28.380 --> 00:35:32.210
So energy, spontaneous feeling,
performing and over-going

00:35:32.210 --> 00:35:34.240
limits is one of
the things that's

00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.270
being expressed in the
exuberance of the film's

00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:41.650
formal structure, in its
encyclopedic reaching out

00:35:41.650 --> 00:35:44.100
to other forms which
it was to incorporate

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:47.050
into itself, and in its
particular dance and song

00:35:47.050 --> 00:35:48.550
sequences.

00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:51.150
And this energy,
this celebration

00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:54.790
of transformative energy, of
the over-going of boundaries,

00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:57.080
strikes me as
particularly American,

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.460
as a uniquely
interesting expression

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:01.960
of what people have
sometimes called

00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:06.050
American optimism, and even
of the democratic spirit,

00:36:06.050 --> 00:36:11.390
of the openness that we
associate with our ideals--

00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:15.250
not the reality, but our
ideals-- of democratic society.

00:36:15.250 --> 00:36:17.250
What these dances
and songs tell us

00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:21.270
then about the place of
dance and song in our lives,

00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:24.530
the idea that you would begin
to dance in a space unused

00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:28.730
to dance, hostile to dance,
transforms the space.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:31.030
So what this film then
says about these things is

00:36:31.030 --> 00:36:36.110
that our speech can be nudged
into song, our way of walking

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:39.690
can be edged into a dance,
and that the ordinary objects

00:36:39.690 --> 00:36:42.540
in our domestic
and public spaces

00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:48.067
can become props in
an improvised ballet.

00:36:48.067 --> 00:36:49.650
When we turn to
Cabaret, we're looking

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:52.140
at a very different
kind of object.

00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:55.540
And it's important to recognize
what I mentioned earlier,

00:36:55.540 --> 00:36:58.420
and I will develop more fully
in a couple of weeks, the fact

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:00.850
that now we have gone
almost beyond genre.

00:37:00.850 --> 00:37:02.630
There are people
who would argue--

00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:06.570
and there are purists,
scholars of the musical film

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.180
who want to argue that,
well, Cabaret really

00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.170
isn't a musical for
a variety of reasons.

00:37:11.170 --> 00:37:13.780
It seems to me a very strange
and unhelpful argument.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:15.770
But I think if you
watch the film closely,

00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:19.180
you'll understand why
people who are partisans

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.980
of the great Hollywood musical
tradition, or even the older

00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:26.530
operatic tradition
represented by value directors

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:30.540
like Rouben Mamoulian would
have problems fitting Cabaret

00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.490
into the category of musical.

00:37:32.490 --> 00:37:34.610
I think it's a
misunderstanding of how

00:37:34.610 --> 00:37:36.220
we should think about musicals.

00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:41.660
But for the moment, let me just
encourage you to watch the film

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:43.470
and think about
how different it is

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:46.180
from traditional musicals--
and especially its tone,

00:37:46.180 --> 00:37:50.740
its moral perspective.

00:37:50.740 --> 00:37:55.046
But also it's in its structure.

00:37:55.046 --> 00:37:56.670
Think about that,
and you'll understand

00:37:56.670 --> 00:38:02.500
more fully why it's easy to see
that this film would be very

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.990
unlikely to have been
made in the Hollywood era,

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:09.430
that it required the
kind of freedom that

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:13.570
came to film after film
was no longer constrained

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.530
by the necessity to speak
in a consensus voice.

00:38:17.530 --> 00:38:19.320
And as I said,
these are matters I

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.370
will try to clarify and
conclude in two weeks

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:25.510
when I return to this question,
when we talk about film

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:28.350
in the '70s, and the
great '70s Western--

00:38:28.350 --> 00:38:33.350
almost contemporary with
Cabaret-- Robert Altman's

00:38:33.350 --> 00:38:36.370
McCabe and Mrs. Miller.

00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.330
I had hoped to say a number of
things about Fosse's career,

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:40.250
but I don't have time.

00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:43.250
And I'm just going to
encourage you-- look him up.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:46.990
He's a very, very
remarkable figure.

00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:53.120
I call him "The Inheritor"
because he was both a Broadway

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.760
director and
choreographer and a dancer

00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:57.500
both on Broadway and in films.

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:03.230
And he performed and directed
both on Broadway and in films.

00:39:03.230 --> 00:39:05.830
He was first a
choreographer in films

00:39:05.830 --> 00:39:07.360
before he became a director.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.500
And in this career as a
performer and choreographer,

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.180
he linked up with almost
all the other great names

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:16.560
of the American musical
stage-- both the Broadway stage

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:18.350
and the Hollywood tradition.

00:39:18.350 --> 00:39:22.760
And in that sense, we
can say that Bob Fosse

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.390
is the inheritor of
the great tradition

00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.650
of the American musical.

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:29.600
And I wish I could go
into detail about this

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.570
and show you how
many affiliations

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.770
and specific connections he
has with the great figures

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:36.770
of the classical age
of American movies,

00:39:36.770 --> 00:39:41.070
and especially the classical
age of the American musical.

00:39:41.070 --> 00:39:44.780
But suffice it to say that it's
a very rich set of connections.

00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.600
And his career is a
very remarkable career,

00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.830
a very honored career.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:54.125
Let me mention one fact
about his career, perhaps

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.870
the most remarkable
one, easy to remember.

00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:01.580
Tells you something
about his diversity

00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.960
as a director, his
gifts, his ambition.

00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:08.590
In 1973, Bob Fosse I think
became the only man in history

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:17.850
to win an Oscar, a Tony, and
an Emmy-- an Oscar for Cabaret

00:40:17.850 --> 00:40:24.915
as best director, and a Tony
for-- or maybe he either he

00:40:24.915 --> 00:40:26.920
won as best director
or the play that he

00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:30.600
directed on Broadway-- Pippin
won as best play on Broadway.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.570
And he also won a
television Emmy for a show

00:40:33.570 --> 00:40:36.280
starring Liza Minnelli,
the star in Cabaret,

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.290
called Liza with a
'Z.' So And I think

00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:42.310
he's the only man in history
for whom those three awards came

00:40:42.310 --> 00:40:47.800
in the same year for
three different texts.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:52.090
He directed one, two,
three, four, five films,

00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.920
of which Cabaret was the second.

00:40:56.590 --> 00:41:02.050
The last four are all very
remarkable and interesting

00:41:02.050 --> 00:41:03.660
texts.

00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.250
I won't talk about
them here, except

00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.458
to encourage you to look
him up and think about them.

00:41:07.458 --> 00:41:11.590
The theme of performance and
the idea of the characters

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:17.770
who are themselves
performers are always

00:41:17.770 --> 00:41:20.340
at the center of his films.

00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:22.280
Not all of his
films involve dance.

00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:24.930
He made a film about
the life of Lenny Bruce

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:27.250
called Lenny starring
Dustin Hoffman,

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:30.090
for example, that doesn't
have musical numbers in it.

00:41:30.090 --> 00:41:31.860
But it has many
performance numbers in it.

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:37.160
And it's a very rich,
complex, sophisticated film.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:43.650
So an interesting and
profoundly serious director.

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:45.550
I wish I could say
more about his career.

00:41:45.550 --> 00:41:47.890
I want to say a word about
the context of Cabaret,

00:41:47.890 --> 00:41:51.310
so you'll understand that aspect
of the film more fully, too.

00:41:51.310 --> 00:41:56.400
It's set in Weimar Germany,
that curious time in the 1920s

00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.570
during the rise of Nazism,
but long before Hitler

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:03.110
has come to power,
in which the Weimar

00:42:03.110 --> 00:42:08.940
Republic, a vulnerable
and unstable democracy,

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.310
but a democracy in
which an enormous amount

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:16.370
of artistic and literary
experimentation was taking

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:17.020
place.

00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:19.750
It's the period of
German expressionism.

00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.630
It's the period of the
great German silent films

00:42:22.630 --> 00:42:24.520
that we talked about earlier.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.300
And so our film Cabaret
is set in that era,

00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:31.560
and in that driven
era, in that divided

00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:35.960
era in which the rise of Nazism
was coupled with or joined to

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:42.250
and connected to the fact
that German society was

00:42:42.250 --> 00:42:44.690
under immense
constraints, because it

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:46.840
had lost the first World War.

00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:49.910
Conditions under which they
had been forced to surrender

00:42:49.910 --> 00:42:51.640
were very onerous.

00:42:51.640 --> 00:42:53.870
There was very high
levels of unemployment.

00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:58.450
It was a schizophrenically
divided society,

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:00.990
a society of great
artistic energies,

00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:03.840
but of great political
divisions and

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:08.030
difficulties, and
nightmare possibilities

00:43:08.030 --> 00:43:13.190
that were lurking in
many of its practices.

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:16.190
And there's a link-- or
at least a partial link--

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:18.960
between the instability
and the excitement,

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:23.010
but also the dividedness
of Weimar Germany,

00:43:23.010 --> 00:43:25.750
and the actual condition of
the United States in the era

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:28.040
when the movie came
out, Because this

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:29.830
is the period at
the end of the '60s,

00:43:29.830 --> 00:43:31.960
after the late '60s
and early '70s,

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:35.280
probably the most divided
time in American history

00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.020
after the Second World War
before our current moment.

00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:41.830
And in fact, the divisions
then were more legitimate.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:44.920
By more legitimate, I mean
they had a more sensible cause.

00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.660
There were terrible
wars going on.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:53.160
There were better reasons
for the partisanship that

00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:55.860
occurred in the late
'60s and early '70s

00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.430
than there are for the weird
partisanship we're suffering

00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:00.780
in the United States today.

00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:03.390
And in any case, there
was a much greater sense

00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:06.400
in the late '60s and
early '70s that the fabric

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.480
of American society was under
attack, that it was imperfect,

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:11.380
not only because the
Vietnam War had so

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:14.170
divided the country
against itself, but because

00:44:14.170 --> 00:44:17.670
of other matters as well,
including the increasing

00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:20.460
militancy of the
civil rights movement,

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:28.970
which had gone from a sort
of a Martin Luther King type

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:35.120
commitment to nonviolent
protest into much more

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.350
disturbing and sometimes
violent confrontations

00:44:38.350 --> 00:44:41.800
with authorities, and with some
theorists and speakers actually

00:44:41.800 --> 00:44:44.690
calling for violence.

00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:47.300
And this racial tension
was then coupled

00:44:47.300 --> 00:44:50.200
by another kind of political
tension coming from the people,

00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:52.454
from the young men and
women-- who were mostly

00:44:52.454 --> 00:44:54.870
young men and women-- who were
opposed to the Vietnam War.

00:44:54.870 --> 00:44:57.180
So it was a very driven
and disturbed time.

00:44:57.180 --> 00:45:00.260
There were then parallels
between the instability

00:45:00.260 --> 00:45:03.290
and the disturbance
of the Weimar period

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:06.070
and the period in which
the film appeared.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.350
And the original
audiences, I think,

00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:11.730
would have been highly
aware of this connection,

00:45:11.730 --> 00:45:16.500
would have seen that although
the film was set in the past,

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:20.190
it spoke to the contemporary
moment in a very powerful way.

00:45:20.190 --> 00:45:23.930
I want also remind
you that there

00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:30.849
are certain aspects of
the style of Cabaret

00:45:30.849 --> 00:45:32.140
that are worth keeping in mind.

00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.210
And one way to
think about this is

00:45:34.210 --> 00:45:40.170
to recognize that both mis en
scene style and montage style

00:45:40.170 --> 00:45:46.040
are embodied in the film,
and are carried to extremes

00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.400
in certain moments of the film.

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:50.170
That is to say, in many of
the performance sequences

00:45:50.170 --> 00:45:53.180
in the film, the camera behaves
in an unbelievably frenetic and

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:59.330
frantic way-- changes your
eye angle, jumps around a lot,

00:45:59.330 --> 00:46:02.120
disorients you sometimes--
almost disorients you

00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.650
in the style of a Hitchcock.

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:06.970
And yet in other sequences
in the film, especially

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:10.200
those outside the cabaret that
take place in ordinary life,

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:13.390
not in a performance space,
the camera and the editing

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:16.570
slow down and become more like
a kind of mise en scene style.

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.710
And the combination of
the two is especially

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:19.840
rich and interesting.

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.240
You might want to watch for
the way these rhythms alter

00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:24.710
your sense of what's
happening in the film,

00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:27.800
the way the film slows down,
and speeds up at certain point.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.760
And I mean this literally in
terms of the number of images

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:32.930
that go by quickly, but
also in terms of the way

00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:35.410
the physical bodies
of the performers

00:46:35.410 --> 00:46:37.030
move across the screen.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:39.220
And of course the way
in which the camera

00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:43.300
itself behaves,
whether it's jittery,

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.720
oriented toward
constant movement;

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:46.750
or whether it's more
stable and gives you

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:50.930
a chance to look
at the environment

00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:54.570
this scene is set in.

00:46:54.570 --> 00:46:57.580
One way I could give you a sense
of the richness of the film

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.950
is to remind you that there's a
kind of texture or multiplicity

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:04.130
in Cabaret in almost every
moment, that if you watch

00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:05.960
for it, and you're
attentive to it,

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:07.410
you will always be rewarded.

00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:10.000
Let me just give you
two very quick examples

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.180
of what I mean by this.

00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:14.310
Remember I suggested to you that
this principle of multiplicity

00:47:14.310 --> 00:47:16.790
is one of the principles
we turn to if we want

00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:18.730
to recognize a work of art.

00:47:18.730 --> 00:47:20.460
The difference
between a work of art

00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.800
and an entertainment in my
terms is that a work of art

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:24.890
is just more intelligent.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:28.220
That is to say, it makes more
complex use of its materials.

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.780
So that in a entertainment,
a particular event or gesture

00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:33.339
may have only one function.

00:47:33.339 --> 00:47:35.630
But in a work of art, you
will have multiple functions.

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:39.530
It will perform several
jobs simultaneously.

00:47:39.530 --> 00:47:42.140
I'll give you two
examples of this.

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:45.100
Think about what takes place
on the periphery of what

00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:47.710
you're watching, and you'll
begin to get some sense of one

00:47:47.710 --> 00:47:52.254
way in which the texture of this
film brings the material alive.

00:47:52.254 --> 00:47:54.420
There's one moment I think
fairly early in the film.

00:47:54.420 --> 00:47:55.253
It's a street scene.

00:47:55.253 --> 00:47:57.380
We're not paying much
attention to what's going on.

00:47:57.380 --> 00:48:02.740
We see, I think, the protagonist
walking in the street.

00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:06.990
And around on the
periphery-- certainly not

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:08.770
in the center of
the frame, nothing

00:48:08.770 --> 00:48:11.340
that is commented on
by the characters--

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:15.460
a cripple slides by on one
of those wheeled platforms

00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:19.400
that people without legs
sometimes used in major cities

00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.660
before-- maybe
they still happen.

00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:26.325
But they were very common in the
first half of the 20th century.

00:48:26.325 --> 00:48:27.210
And we see this guy.

00:48:27.210 --> 00:48:31.050
Obviously he's a wounded
veteran, and he's an amputee.

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:32.950
And he pushes himself
along on this cart.

00:48:32.950 --> 00:48:34.910
And we just see him go by.

00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:36.600
But what's
interesting about that

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.800
is that this cripple
on the platform

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.620
has a little flag
on his platform.

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:42.500
Guess what kind of a flag it is?

00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:45.250
It's a Nazi flag.

00:48:45.250 --> 00:48:47.530
And this is early in the
film, before the Nazis

00:48:47.530 --> 00:48:49.310
have become a powerful force.

00:48:49.310 --> 00:48:52.040
The rise of Nazism is in
the background of film,

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.760
as you will see.

00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.490
The Nazis moved
from the periphery

00:48:55.490 --> 00:48:58.920
to the center of the frame
before the film is over.

00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:02.750
And that's the fundamental
historical motion of the film.

00:49:02.750 --> 00:49:04.820
But all of that's taking
place in the background.

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:07.170
The foreground are the
central characters,

00:49:07.170 --> 00:49:12.200
and the comic and innocent--
and ultimately not so comic,

00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:14.330
disturbing love affairs
and difficulties

00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:17.240
that they encounter
in this environment.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:19.550
They're too naive or
innocent to understand

00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:22.910
the historical forces
that are surrounding them.

00:49:22.910 --> 00:49:26.962
So that example of the
Nazi flag and this crippled

00:49:26.962 --> 00:49:28.920
figure-- because the
crippled figure is in fact

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:35.600
an allusion to the
onerous demands that

00:49:35.600 --> 00:49:39.340
were put upon Germany by
France and the other allies

00:49:39.340 --> 00:49:40.460
at the end of the war.

00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.600
And he's crippled.

00:49:42.600 --> 00:49:45.645
So the assumption is he's
probably a war veteran.

00:49:45.645 --> 00:49:47.020
I don't remember
if he's actually

00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.960
wearing a uniform, which
would confirm this.

00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:49.820
And it would be
helpful if he were.

00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:50.700
But I don't remember.

00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.010
Watch for it, and you'll see.

00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.700
But in any case,
he refers to that.

00:49:54.700 --> 00:49:57.090
Anyone attentive to
the firm can recognize

00:49:57.090 --> 00:50:01.560
that the historical
texture of the film

00:50:01.560 --> 00:50:03.720
is carried by such moments.

00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:06.020
There's another such
moment, also so minor

00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:07.630
that you might not notice it.

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:09.650
The foreground is
the love affair,

00:50:09.650 --> 00:50:12.260
or not yet a love affair, but
the acquaintance, the deepening

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.500
friendship between
the two protagonists--

00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.240
Sally Bowles and her boyfriend.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.670
And they go out for
a walk in Berlin.

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:22.380
And Sally pretends that she's
this immensely sophisticated

00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:23.210
woman.

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:26.345
Turns out that she's fooling
herself and fooling us.

00:50:26.345 --> 00:50:27.720
She's not at all,
even though she

00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.840
pretends to a great
kind of sophistication.

00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:32.370
And she sings dirty
songs in a cabaret,

00:50:32.370 --> 00:50:34.230
and she performs
in a cabaret where

00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:35.910
they make jokes
about everything,

00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:38.590
including all forms
of sexual perversion.

00:50:38.590 --> 00:50:40.200
Nonetheless, she's an innocent.

00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:43.570
She has no way of recognizing
the depth and complexity

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:47.580
of the moral evil and
moral terror that's

00:50:47.580 --> 00:50:48.470
building around her.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:49.770
And she's not alone in this.

00:50:49.770 --> 00:50:52.280
Most of the other characters
in the foreground of the film

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:56.020
perform this same naive
ballet, although Sally Bowles

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:58.070
is the most powerful
instance of it.

00:50:58.070 --> 00:51:00.957
It is certainly Liza
Minnelli's greatest role.

00:51:00.957 --> 00:51:02.790
Certainly the role that
she'll be remembered

00:51:02.790 --> 00:51:04.700
for long after she's dead.

00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.800
Long after we're
all in the ground,

00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:08.800
Liza Minnelli's
performance in this film

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:13.040
will still be treasured
and savored, I think.

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.280
So another instance
of the multiplicity.

00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.000
When we find the two characters
are walking in the street,

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.250
and Sally says, oh, I want
to show you something I do.

00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.780
And she pulls this guy along.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:28.510
She leans up against the side
of an elevated train stanchion.

00:51:28.510 --> 00:51:30.600
And she waits until
the train comes by.

00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.470
And as the train
comes by, she screams.

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:34.220
And she says, see?

00:51:34.220 --> 00:51:36.761
Whenever you wait for the noise,
nobody will hear you scream.

00:51:36.761 --> 00:51:39.020
And she's just expressing
her exuberance.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.650
She's showing him
how she commands

00:51:40.650 --> 00:51:44.010
this space, how she knows
how to use this urban space.

00:51:44.010 --> 00:51:45.810
But there's an irony
she's unaware of.

00:51:45.810 --> 00:51:48.650
When she leans up against the
wall behind her, what we see

00:51:48.650 --> 00:51:50.330
are political posters.

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:53.440
And the political posters
behind her are defaced.

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.860
They're both Nazi and
communist posters.

00:51:55.860 --> 00:51:57.430
And the communists
and the Nazis are

00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:59.340
defacing one another's posters.

00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:02.140
And what is implicit then
again in the background

00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:06.540
against the foreground of these
two relatively naive characters

00:52:06.540 --> 00:52:08.950
carrying on is the
historical reality

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:10.260
that's building behind them.

00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:13.050
Another example of what I
mean by the multiplicity,

00:52:13.050 --> 00:52:14.820
the texture of this film.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.520
Next to finally, the
musical numbers--

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:23.530
penultimately the
musical numbers.

00:52:23.530 --> 00:52:26.730
Another kind of integration
is going on in this film,

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:29.490
when we talk about the
integrated musical as Arthur

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:33.690
Freed and his comrades during
the studio era articulated

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:34.440
this idea.

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:36.680
We're not talking about
the form of integration

00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.167
that we see in Cabaret.

00:52:38.167 --> 00:52:39.750
And this in fact is
one of the reasons

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:43.390
that some people argue that
Cabaret is not a musical.

00:52:43.390 --> 00:52:46.740
Because with one exception,
none of the musical performances

00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:50.270
in Cabaret take place out of
a performance environment.

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:52.080
They all take place
in the cabaret.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.180
The film is about a
cabaret performer,

00:52:54.180 --> 00:52:56.670
and we see many
performances in the cabaret.

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:58.416
Now when we watch
those performances,

00:52:58.416 --> 00:53:00.540
we see them from angles
that no one in the audience

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:03.580
could ever see, because Fosse
is a genius with the camera,

00:53:03.580 --> 00:53:05.930
and creates visual
effects drawing

00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:08.180
on the tradition of
the Hollywood musical

00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.420
that could never be
replicated in a theater.

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.730
Nonetheless, the
performances themselves

00:53:12.730 --> 00:53:14.230
are theatrical performances.

00:53:14.230 --> 00:53:15.940
They all are real performances.

00:53:15.940 --> 00:53:18.850
And when we see the characters
behaving like real characters,

00:53:18.850 --> 00:53:22.120
they don't suddenly burst
into song and dance.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:24.600
Because there's something
theoretically so implausible

00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:28.220
about that, that Cabaret
refuses that convention.

00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:31.380
It refuses to embrace
that basic convention

00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.430
of the American musical,
which is that one

00:53:33.430 --> 00:53:36.210
way that people express their
exuberance-- I love you.

00:53:36.210 --> 00:53:36.900
I love you.

00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.420
Now let me sing a
song telling you

00:53:38.420 --> 00:53:41.610
how much I love you-- whereas
in real life we don't do that.

00:53:41.610 --> 00:53:44.862
Now I don't think that this
convention is a convention that

00:53:44.862 --> 00:53:45.820
undermines the musical.

00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:48.630
It's a convention, or
a rule, or a habit,

00:53:48.630 --> 00:53:51.570
a protocol you need to
embrace in order to experience

00:53:51.570 --> 00:53:53.110
these films appropriately.

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:55.700
And it's no more
implausible in one sense

00:53:55.700 --> 00:53:57.820
than the implausibility
of opera singers

00:53:57.820 --> 00:54:01.090
bursting into song at
moments of great passion.

00:54:01.090 --> 00:54:02.910
The convention requires it.

00:54:02.910 --> 00:54:06.900
It's as if we're in a form
of artistic experience

00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:10.060
in which art is crystallizing
experience for us.

00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:12.240
So I don't mean to undermine
this convention at all,

00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.610
or cast doubt on it.

00:54:13.610 --> 00:54:17.520
But Cabaret refuses
that convention--

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.580
with one exception.

00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:21.760
And I'm calling attention
to that exception.

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.620
I'm not going to
tell you what it is,

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:23.911
but I want you to watch for it.

00:54:23.911 --> 00:54:27.610
There's one moment in the
film when there is a song sung

00:54:27.610 --> 00:54:29.780
outside by ordinary people.

00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.390
It happens spontaneously.

00:54:31.390 --> 00:54:34.670
It may be the most morally
and historically frightening

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:38.110
moment in the whole of the film.

00:54:38.110 --> 00:54:40.880
And it's completely
believable, totally

00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:42.340
plausible that it would happen.

00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:44.710
But that's the only moment
in the film when there's

00:54:44.710 --> 00:54:48.100
any singing that doesn't take
place inside a space intended

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:49.610
for singing and dancing.

00:54:49.610 --> 00:54:52.050
So one of the interesting
things about Cabaret

00:54:52.050 --> 00:54:55.360
is that there is a kind of true
integration of song and dance,

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.400
because none of that
happens except in spaces

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.220
where it's appropriate--
realistically appropriate.

00:55:03.220 --> 00:55:05.090
And so you might watch for that.

00:55:05.090 --> 00:55:08.630
And the complexity
that this decision

00:55:08.630 --> 00:55:10.660
on the part of Bob
Fosse and the people

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:14.950
making the film, the
impact of that decision

00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:17.820
on your understanding
of the movie as a whole.

00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:19.619
Finally, the central
themes of the film.

00:55:19.619 --> 00:55:20.910
I've already talked about them.

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:23.530
The theme of innocence-- the
way the central characters

00:55:23.530 --> 00:55:26.290
in the film are too
innocent to understand

00:55:26.290 --> 00:55:28.670
the historical forces around
them, underestimate them.

00:55:28.670 --> 00:55:30.859
This isn't just true
of the central figures.

00:55:30.859 --> 00:55:32.400
It's true of the
secondary characters

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:40.670
as well, some of whom even more
poignantly embody this theme.

00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:42.030
And then the theme of history.

00:55:42.030 --> 00:55:43.020
What history is.

00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:48.530
How the force of history can
overwhelm individual desires,

00:55:48.530 --> 00:55:51.420
individual hopes, love itself.

00:55:51.420 --> 00:55:54.070
And of course, also
the limits of satire.

00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:57.850
The cabaret is a space of
satire, a space of mockery,

00:55:57.850 --> 00:56:00.990
a space of exuberant
intellectual distance

00:56:00.990 --> 00:56:02.660
and disdain.

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.330
Much of the energy
of the cabaret

00:56:04.330 --> 00:56:08.167
comes from an impulse of
parity, mockery, satire.

00:56:08.167 --> 00:56:09.750
And in the very
beginning of the film,

00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:12.160
there's actually a moment
where you can see the Joel Grey

00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.620
character, who plays this
ominous, strange figure

00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:20.730
of the emcee, the
interlocutor, in the cabaret.

00:56:20.730 --> 00:56:23.980
He sort of is the
master of ceremonies.

00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:26.710
And there's one moment
early in the film when

00:56:26.710 --> 00:56:31.060
he, in a rather disgusting
scene in which they replicate

00:56:31.060 --> 00:56:32.450
a scene of mud wrestling.

00:56:32.450 --> 00:56:33.514
And he's emceeing it.

00:56:33.514 --> 00:56:35.680
And he reaches down, and
he picks up a piece of mud.

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:37.210
And he rubs it on his upper lip.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:39.020
And he makes himself
look like Hitler.

00:56:39.020 --> 00:56:40.760
And he's mocking Hitler in that.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:42.620
Well if you compare
that early moment

00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:46.351
in which Hitler and Nazism
are objects of mockery,

00:56:46.351 --> 00:56:47.850
there's also an
early scene in which

00:56:47.850 --> 00:56:51.340
we see a Nazi being pulled out
of the audience of the cabaret

00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.640
and pushed outside,
kicked out of the cabaret,

00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:59.330
because Nazis are thought
to be unacceptable.

00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:00.780
They're thought
to be vulgarians.

00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.040
This is early in the film.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.960
By the time the film is
over, by the time you

00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.335
come to the very
end of the film,

00:57:05.335 --> 00:57:07.880
one of the very final
images of the film

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.520
shows us the audience
of the cabaret filled

00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:13.990
with Nazi officers,
filled with Nazi uniforms.

00:57:13.990 --> 00:57:16.330
The Nazis have moved
from the periphery

00:57:16.330 --> 00:57:17.740
to the center of the movie.

00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:22.660
And that's part of the terror
that the film dramatizes.

00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:24.810
And it also therefore
of course dramatizes

00:57:24.810 --> 00:57:27.620
the limits of satire,
because the cabaret itself,

00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:30.580
like the characters, imagines
itself to be exempted

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.260
from or apart from history.

00:57:32.260 --> 00:57:35.150
It can maintain its
mockery, its distance.

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:37.110
Satire can protect me.

00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:38.950
And of course the
cabaret is just

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:41.660
as naive as the
characters themselves.

00:57:41.660 --> 00:57:45.690
It's overwhelmed by the
forces of history in a way

00:57:45.690 --> 00:57:49.040
that the characters
themselves also are.

00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:51.240
Both of these films
in their own way

00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:56.900
have generated a tremendously
interesting and serious volume

00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:00.830
of discourse, both in terms
of their musical qualities

00:58:00.830 --> 00:58:03.760
and the qualities of
their choreography,

00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.870
and in terms of their content.

00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:07.750
They're really
such complex films

00:58:07.750 --> 00:58:09.380
that watching them
together makes

00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:12.380
an immense intellectual
demand on everyone.

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:14.080
I know you're capable
of that, but I

00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:16.260
hope that you'll
take the time to let

00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:19.550
the implications of these films
settle into your mind for days,

00:58:19.550 --> 00:58:22.270
and maybe even weeks
after you've watched them.

00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:25.720
And I hope, of course, that
this first viewing will only

00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.810
be the first of many.

00:58:27.810 --> 00:58:31.090
I wish you the joy of
these wonderful movies.

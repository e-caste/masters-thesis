YEN-JIE LEE: I think for
the physics educators,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.430
I would suggest
then to introduce

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.250
the kind of big
question we are trying

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.970
to solve in the very
beginning of the lecture.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.990
Then people will come
into your lecture

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.370
and then knowing that
we are trying to solve

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.560
this specific question.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.210
Then we work on the theoretical
calculation using our physics

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.440
intuition and physical laws
we learned from other class

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.030
to solve this question.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.990
And then we check
if we have answered

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.190
the big question
which we actually

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.720
introduced in the beginning.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.190
And finally, I
would like to stress

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.930
that comparison between,
say, analytical calculation

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.160
and the demo is actually
very, very important.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.800
OK?

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.600
Because that gives
you a chance to verify

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.700
your theoretical assumption
to see if our calculations

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.780
actually make any sense.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.240
And finally, I usually summarize
the kind of take-home message,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.000
or the conclusion
from this course

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.610
so that people can walk
out of the classroom

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.260
and knowing that
this is actually what

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.540
they learned from this lecture.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.420
So actually, I think
that is actually

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.270
a applicable to all kinds
of different physics course.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.170
If we actually try
to do that way,

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.940
then that would make the physics
course much more enjoyable.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.160
In general, teaching
a course, the lecturer

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.180
has to show that he is so
interested in this course.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.100
It is true when the lecturer
actually knows about the course

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.120
very well and knows the
excitement about this course

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.080
very well.

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.880
So why don't you just show it?

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:53.480
Right?

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.000
Because that will
excite a lot of interest

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.490
from the students
in the classroom.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.840
And also, that will make your
lecture much more enjoyable,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.330
not only for the students,
but also for yourself

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.920
because you feel really
happy when you're

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.490
teaching in the classroom.

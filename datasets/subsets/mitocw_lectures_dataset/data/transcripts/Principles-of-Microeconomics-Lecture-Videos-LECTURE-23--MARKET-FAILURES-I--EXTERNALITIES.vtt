JONATHAN GRUBER: Externalities,
so, so far in the class,

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.970
we once again remember
the big picture.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.950
We started with the
first fundamental theorem

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:27.190
overall for economics, which
is that the competitive market

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:29.950
will maximize total
social welfare.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.470
Then we said that will not
be true under conditions

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:33.430
of market failure.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.830
Remember, market failure
doesn't mean market collapse.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.610
It means when there are
barriers to the market achieving

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.860
this first best outcome, OK?

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.310
One barrier is
imperfect competition.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:48.910
One barrier was
imperfect information.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.560
A third barrier to
welfare maximization

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.300
or a third source of market
failure is externalities, OK?

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.050
That's the third source
of market failure,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.820
and we're going to
talk about that today.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.950
What is an externality?

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.629
Let me be very clear
about the definition.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.720
An externality occurs
whenever one party's actions

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.178
makes another party
better or worse off, OK?

00:01:15.178 --> 00:01:16.720
Let's do it-- let's
make it a person,

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.230
whether my actions make
you better or worse off,

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.540
but I don't bear the
consequences of that.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.040
So, when my actions make
you better or worse off,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.560
but I don't bear
the consequences,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.000
then there's an externality.

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.460
So let's talk about
that in the context.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.460
Let's start with the classic
example of externalities, which

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.560
is a negative
production externality,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.630
a negative production
externality, OK?

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.290
The classic example
is you've got a river.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.760
On that river is a steel plant.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.870
That steel plant
produces steel, OK?

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:03.880
But, as a byproduct
of that production,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.543
it dumps sludge
into the river, OK?

00:02:05.543 --> 00:02:06.710
You guys remember The Lorax?

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.740
So it's basically The Lorax, OK?

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.280
So, basically, the steel plant
dumps sludge into the river,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.030
OK?

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.600
That sludge floats down the
river and kills the fish.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.320
Those killed fish mean that
fishermen cannot make as much

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.730
money fishing on the river, OK?

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.230
So, basically, there's sludge
coming out of the factory,

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.870
and that sludge we're going
to make the assumption

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.677
is directly proportional
to the production of steel.

00:02:38.677 --> 00:02:41.010
So we're going to say, for
every unit of steel produced,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.820
there's one unit of sludge
that emits on the factory just

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.200
to make this model easy.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.740
So, every unit of steel,
there's one unit of sludge.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.390
That sludge flows down the
river and kills the fish.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.280
Unfortunately, there
are fishermen down

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.560
this river who are
trying to catch fish,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.100
and that hurts their
livelihood, OK?

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.380
So this is a classic
example of living

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.550
by an externality, because
the steel plant's behavior is

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.008
imposing a cost
on the fishermen.

00:03:07.008 --> 00:03:09.050
Their sludge is imposing
a cost on the fishermen,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.425
but the steel plant doesn't
bear any consequence of that.

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:13.972
They just dump the sludge
and forget about it, OK?

00:03:13.972 --> 00:03:15.430
So that's what we
mean by negative.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.050
It's a negative externality
because my actions

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.913
are hurting you.

00:03:18.913 --> 00:03:21.080
The steel plant's actions
are hurting the fishermen.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.163
It's a production externality
because it comes out

00:03:23.163 --> 00:03:26.375
of the production process,
in this case, for steel.

00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:28.250
So that's what we mean
by negative production

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.420
externality.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.200
It means that, when one
party's production adversely

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:36.410
affects another party, but
the party doing the production

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.840
doesn't bear any
consequences of that, then

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.110
that's a negative
production externality.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.360
So what effect does that have?

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.230
Let's go to figure 22-1
and talk graphically

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.270
about how we think about
production externalities, OK?

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:51.945
This is the market for steel.

00:03:51.945 --> 00:03:53.570
In figure 22-1 is
the market for steel,

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.862
the quantity of steel on the
x-axis, the price of steel

00:03:55.862 --> 00:03:58.220
on the y-axis, OK?

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.250
The market is initially
in equilibrium at point A.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.060
That is where demand, which is
the downward-sloping blue line,

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.290
equals supply, which is
upward-sloping blue line.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:13.020
Now, as we said, in a
perfectly competitive market,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.220
demand represents the
marginal willingness

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:23.010
to pay for the good, which is
equal to the marginal benefit

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:25.670
that consumers get from
consuming the good, OK?

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:27.420
The marginal benefit
of consuming the good

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.280
is the marginal
willingness to pay.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.760
And that's what's represented
by the demand curve, OK?

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.260
We're not going to
touch that here.

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.000
We're going to leave
that alone, OK?

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.690
The supply curve is the firm's
marginal willingness to supply,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.870
which is their
marginal cost, OK?

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:46.640
So, in the perfectly
competitive market

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.340
where marginal benefit
equals marginal cost,

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:51.590
we get equilibrium.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.590
And that yields the
welfare-maximizing outcome.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:55.520
The market succeeds.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.390
It does not fail, OK?

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.800
The difference now
is we're now going

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.780
to drive a wedge between
privately perceived

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.230
benefits and social benefits.

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.020
So, for the consumption of
steel with the demand curve,

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.050
we're going to see the
benefit to individuals

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.378
is the benefit to society.

00:05:14.378 --> 00:05:15.420
They're one and the same.

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.010
That's what we've
assumed all course.

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:19.600
But, for the supply
of steel, we're

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.860
going to say wait a second.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.852
The benefit to society is
different than the benefit

00:05:25.852 --> 00:05:26.810
to the steel producers.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.352
Or I'm sorry.

00:05:27.352 --> 00:05:30.330
The cost to society is different
than the cost to the steel

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.177
producers.

00:05:31.177 --> 00:05:32.760
The cost to the steel
producers, which

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.540
is their private marginal
cost, is the supply curve,

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.470
but the social marginal
cost adds the damage

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.180
they're doing to the fishermen.

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.340
That is society encompasses
all the actors in society.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:51.650
It encompasses both the steel
plant and the fishermen.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:54.290
So the marginal cost
to society is the cost

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:59.180
of producing the steel plus
the marginal damage being

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:00.290
done to the fishermen.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:04.970
So social marginal cost
equals private marginal cost

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.738
plus marginal damage.

00:06:07.738 --> 00:06:09.780
Social marginal cost equals
private marginal cost

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:11.940
plus the marginal damage.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.320
And we see that as the red line.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:22.510
What that means, from a welfare
perspective, what we care about

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:25.030
is social marginal
benefits and costs, not

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.220
private marginal
benefits and costs.

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.800
So what that means is
the social optimum,

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.602
the welfare-maximizing optimum,
is actually at point C. Point

00:06:34.602 --> 00:06:36.310
C is the welfare-maximizing
optimum where

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:41.994
the social marginal cost equals
the social marginal benefit,

00:06:41.994 --> 00:06:42.950
OK?

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:47.780
And, therefore, we overproduce.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.840
What's happening is
the steel company,

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.790
not considering
the damage they're

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.590
doing through production to the
fisherman, produces too much.

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.050
The steel company
produces at the point

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:03.800
where private
marginal cost equals

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.140
private marginal benefit,
which, in our case,

00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.420
equals social
marginal benefit, OK?

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.360
That's the private
market decision.

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:15.320
But, in fact, it should
be producing at the point

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.373
where social
marginal cost equals

00:07:18.373 --> 00:07:20.540
private marginal benefit,
private marginal benefit--

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.440
equals social
marginal benefit, OK?

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.330
And the point where
social marginal cost

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.840
equals social marginal
benefit is lower production.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.770
Why?

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.170
Because lower
production avoids--

00:07:33.170 --> 00:07:37.490
reduces the damage being done
to the fishermen down the river,

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.460
OK?

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.120
So the optimum, from
society's perspective,

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.250
is point C. In other words,
there is a market failure.

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.690
The private market
is not delivering

00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:51.990
the welfare-maximizing outcome.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:55.960
And we can see that
creates a deadweight loss.

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.210
The deadweight loss
is the units that

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.123
are traded that are
socially inefficient.

00:08:02.123 --> 00:08:03.540
Why are they
socially inefficient?

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:04.910
They're privately efficient.

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:08.255
If you see Q2 and Q1, before
we introduced externalities,

00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:10.880
we'd say, well, it's a shame if
they don't get produced, right?

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.422
If we ignore
externalities, we'd say,

00:08:12.422 --> 00:08:15.730
Q2 and Q1, well, they have a
benefit higher than their cost.

00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:17.120
So they should get produced.

00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.912
But, actually, in a
world of externalities,

00:08:18.912 --> 00:08:21.200
their benefit is
lower than their cost

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.620
because their cost incorporates
the damage done to the fish.

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:26.240
So there's a deadweight loss.

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.349
Critically, remember,
you've got to know

00:08:27.349 --> 00:08:29.182
how to draw these
deadweight loss triangles.

00:08:29.182 --> 00:08:31.130
Remember, deadweight
loss triangles

00:08:31.130 --> 00:08:34.010
always point to the optimum.

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:38.059
The deadweight lost triangle
is the area ABC, OK?

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.880
It's drawn-- it's
units that are sold

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.850
where the social
marginal cost exceeds

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.800
the social marginal benefit.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.790
And that's that
deadweight loss triangle.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.600
So there's an
inefficiency arising

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.060
from the fact the
private actors do not

00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:56.660
account for the social
implications of their actions,

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.820
OK?

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.640
Questions about that?

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.810
So we have here a
classic example,

00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:05.810
perhaps the classic example
in all of economics,

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:08.230
of a market failure.

00:09:08.230 --> 00:09:09.990
The classic example
is a market failure

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:15.030
happens when the social
implications of your actions

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.255
are different than the
private implications

00:09:17.255 --> 00:09:19.380
since people maximize their
own private well-being.

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.162
That's what Adam Smith
sort of taught us.

00:09:21.162 --> 00:09:22.620
The notion of the
invisible hand is

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.660
that the market acting
in its own interests

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:26.820
will deliver the best
outcomes for society.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.740
We're saying, no,
that's not true

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.420
if the market's
own interests has

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:36.990
implications for other parties
that are not accounted for, OK?

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:44.420
Now externalities don't have to
just be on the production side.

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:51.197
We can also have negative
consumption externalities.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.170
That would be a case where
my literally consuming a good

00:09:59.170 --> 00:10:02.240
makes you worse off.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.960
My consuming a good
makes you worse off, OK?

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:10.930
So let me start with
a simple question.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.380
Let's start with a perfectly
competitive market.

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:19.680
If I consume a good, I
raise demand for that good.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.630
That raises the price.

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:25.110
Is that an externality?

00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:27.390
In a perfectly competitive
market, it's not.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:28.930
Why isn't that an externality?

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:29.730
If I consume the--

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.772
if I want to consume the
good, the price goes up.

00:10:31.772 --> 00:10:33.200
Everyone pays a higher price.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.570
Why is that not an externality?

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:34.780
Yeah?

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.420
STUDENT: Because you
also bear the cost.

00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.462
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because
you also bear the costs.

00:10:38.462 --> 00:10:40.180
An externality only
occurs when you don't

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:41.640
bear the costs of your actions.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.670
When you want a car, and,
therefore, the price of cars

00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:47.560
goes up, you pay
that higher price.

00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.440
Externalities only
occur when you

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.572
don't bear the consequences.

00:10:51.572 --> 00:10:53.280
So, in general,
consumption externalities

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.820
don't happen through
causing higher prices.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:58.800
Consumption externalities
happen more directly when

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.960
my consumption affects you.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.130
So the best example of
this would be smoking, OK?

00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.632
When I smoke, it affects you.

00:11:08.632 --> 00:11:10.090
It affects you in
a number of ways.

00:11:10.090 --> 00:11:12.400
Most directly, if I
smoke in this classroom,

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.150
you get secondhand smoke,
and you get ill as a result.

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:17.860
But that's not all.

00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:23.290
It affects you because, if
I smoke, and I get sick,

00:11:23.290 --> 00:11:28.020
and my health care costs go
up, then, well, I work at MIT.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.630
All my fellow MIT employees
bear those costs because we all

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.130
share health insurance.

00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:34.152
And, when I retire,
all society bears

00:11:34.152 --> 00:11:35.610
those costs because
those costs are

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:37.470
paid for by the
Medicare program, which

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.470
is financed by taxation.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.620
So my health care costs
are an externality.

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.690
Secondhand smoke
is an externality.

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.060
What are some other
externalities from smoking?

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:51.010
What are other externalities
that can occur from smoking?

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.530
Yeah?

00:11:51.530 --> 00:11:53.840
STUDENT: Environmental
damage from the production.

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.882
JONATHAN GRUBER: Well,
that would be a production

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:56.900
externality, OK?

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:58.567
We're going to leave
that alone for now.

00:11:58.567 --> 00:12:00.890
I'm just talking about
from consuming cigarettes.

00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:03.830
From consuming cigarettes, what
else-- what other damage comes?

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:04.475
So I make you--

00:12:04.475 --> 00:12:06.350
I may make you sick
through secondhand smoke.

00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.660
I might raise health care costs.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:11.815
Well, I might raise
health care costs, OK?

00:12:11.815 --> 00:12:13.190
What else is
another externality?

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:14.570
What else does smoking do?

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.330
Well, it turns out
there are 100,000.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:22.620
This is a number which I
triple check because I still

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:23.640
can't believe it.

00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:26.610
100,000 people every
single year die

00:12:26.610 --> 00:12:29.340
in fires caused by
smokers, not in the US,

00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:32.470
worldwide, which
is a crazy number.

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.280
But, if you think about how
tightly packed slums are

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.960
in developing
countries, one person

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.752
falling asleep with
their cigarette burning

00:12:38.752 --> 00:12:41.220
can kill thousands
of people, OK?

00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.850
That is an externality
because my action to smoke

00:12:44.850 --> 00:12:46.522
has killed you, OK?

00:12:46.522 --> 00:12:48.730
And I'm clearly not going
to compensate you for that.

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:52.430
So that's another
externality, OK?

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:56.840
What about the fact that smokers
are less productive at work.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.150
They have to take
more smoke breaks.

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:01.070
They might get sick more often.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:04.217
Is that an externality or not?

00:13:04.217 --> 00:13:06.300
The fact that smokers are
less productive at work,

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.540
is that an externality or not?

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:08.200
And why or why not?

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:08.710
Yeah?

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:10.110
STUDENT: Not necessarily
because, if they're

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:11.500
less productive, they're
going to do less work

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.250
and get paid less.

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:14.530
JONATHAN GRUBER: Exactly,
it's not an externality

00:13:14.530 --> 00:13:16.910
if they're paid less.

00:13:16.910 --> 00:13:19.933
This is the key thing, which is
it's only an externality if you

00:13:19.933 --> 00:13:21.100
don't bear the consequences.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.930
If smokers are less
productive at work,

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:24.700
and they get paid
less as a result

00:13:24.700 --> 00:13:26.950
by exactly the same amount
they're less productive,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:28.960
there's no externality.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.043
But, if their wage
doesn't fully adjust,

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:32.710
and, therefore, their
lower productivity

00:13:32.710 --> 00:13:35.085
affects everybody else in the
firm or the firm's profits,

00:13:35.085 --> 00:13:37.270
that is an externality, OK?

00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:39.610
So this is the deep
aspect of externalities.

00:13:39.610 --> 00:13:41.500
You have to think
about whether people

00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:44.800
are compensating for it, OK?

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.910
You have to think about that.

00:13:46.910 --> 00:13:54.260
OK, most importantly, the
fact I kill myself by smoking

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:56.840
is not an externality, OK?

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.818
Smokers die seven years
earlier on average.

00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:01.610
Roughly speaking, every
cigarette you smoke

00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:03.590
lowers your life
by seven minutes.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:07.220
It's pretty linear, OK?

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.390
But you know what?

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:10.820
If I sit by myself on a rock
in the middle of nowhere

00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:18.090
and smoke until I die, no
problem because, in that case,

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:21.440
the social implications are
the private implications.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.300
I've made my privately
optimal decision,

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.883
and there's no effect
on anybody else.

00:14:24.883 --> 00:14:26.550
So it's also socially optimal.

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:28.610
There's only an externality if
we have one these mechanisms,

00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:30.380
like if I'm smoking, I'm in
the woods, and I start a fire,

00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:31.760
and the fire
company has to come.

00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.068
That's an externality.

00:14:33.068 --> 00:14:34.610
But, as long as I
just sit by myself,

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:35.870
and I don't bother anybody--

00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:37.160
I just smoke until I die--

00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.160
there's no externalities, OK?

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:41.780
So externalities come through
the effects on others.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:45.860
So let's think about the
externalities of smoking.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:49.070
Let's think about a negative
consumption externality, OK?

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.980
Here we have the
market for cigarettes.

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.530
On the x-axis, we
have the number--

00:14:53.530 --> 00:14:56.030
I'm sorry, figure 22-2.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.800
On the x-axis, we
have the number

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.680
of cigarettes, quantity
of cigarettes consumed.

00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:03.470
On the y-axis, we have the
price of cigarettes per pack.

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:06.170
We have an initial
equilibrium at point A, which

00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:10.480
is where the private
marginal benefit equals

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.223
the private marginal cost.

00:15:12.223 --> 00:15:13.640
Here we're going
to assume there's

00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.350
no externalities from
producing tobacco.

00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:17.433
Let's assume there's no
sludge produced, whatever.

00:15:17.433 --> 00:15:18.620
That's a separate issue, OK?

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:20.370
There may be production
externalities too.

00:15:20.370 --> 00:15:21.078
We covered those.

00:15:21.078 --> 00:15:22.910
You already know how
to think about those.

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.535
But here let's assume
there aren't any.

00:15:24.535 --> 00:15:26.095
Let's assume the
social marginal cost

00:15:26.095 --> 00:15:27.470
equals the private
marginal cost,

00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.940
no production externalities.

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:30.950
But there is a
consumption externality.

00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:33.620
Every cigarette I smoke
is bad for society.

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.230
What that means is the
social marginal benefit

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:39.502
is below the private
marginal benefit.

00:15:39.502 --> 00:15:41.960
The social marginal benefit is
the private marginal benefit

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.420
minus the marginal
damage I'm doing.

00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.690
MD is the Marginal Damage,
the marginal damage I'm doing.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.190
That's estimated to be about--

00:15:50.190 --> 00:15:52.850
absent secondhand smoke, the
damage of smoking is about

00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:54.770
$0.50 a pack.

00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:59.210
The secondhand smoke
part is really hard,

00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:02.290
and the estimates are anywhere
from $0.01 to $2 per pack.

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:04.910
So that's hard to know
how big that is, OK?

00:16:04.910 --> 00:16:09.680
But, certainly, we have
this negative consumption

00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:14.060
externality, which
is that, basically,

00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:18.260
every pack of cigarettes I smoke
is worth at least $0.50 less

00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:21.320
to society than it's worth to
me because I have these external

00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:24.830
effects on society and
perhaps a lot more than that.

00:16:24.830 --> 00:16:27.740
As a result, I should smoke--

00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.400
I choose to smoke at point
A, but the social optimum

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.652
is point C.

00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:34.610
So, once again, I've
created a deadweight loss.

00:16:34.610 --> 00:16:37.040
Once again, I'm over consuming.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.420
There's overconsumption here.

00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:40.253
Just like there was
overproduction of steel.

00:16:40.253 --> 00:16:42.290
There's overconsumption
and a deadweight loss

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:45.230
because there are units that are
privately optimal to consume,

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.550
but not socially optimal.

00:16:51.330 --> 00:16:57.017
Now, externalities, this
is kind of a fun topic

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.100
because it is interesting.

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:02.120
I talk-- so let's talk for a
second about secondhand smoke

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.720
and whether that's
actually an externality.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.079
So almost all the damage
of secondhand smoke

00:17:07.079 --> 00:17:08.849
is not done by
smoking in a crowd.

00:17:08.849 --> 00:17:10.442
It's done to family members.

00:17:10.442 --> 00:17:12.150
Almost all the damage
of secondhand smoke

00:17:12.150 --> 00:17:13.170
is done to family members.

00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:15.839
Mostly, it's that you make your
family members sick by smoking.

00:17:15.839 --> 00:17:18.290
Is that an externality?

00:17:18.290 --> 00:17:19.630
When or when is it not an--

00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:21.869
under what conditions might
it not be an externality?

00:17:21.869 --> 00:17:22.060
Yeah?

00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:23.880
STUDENT: Well, I guess it
wouldn't be an externality

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.280
if like let's say you die.

00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:27.200
And then the consequences
of them getting sick

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.453
doesn't affect you at all.

00:17:28.453 --> 00:17:29.370
Or, well, I guess it--

00:17:29.370 --> 00:17:31.703
JONATHAN GRUBER: No, no, then
it-- no, then it would be.

00:17:31.703 --> 00:17:33.770
OK, so what-- under what
conditions-- under what

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:35.520
conditions would it
not be an externality?

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.082
When-- yeah?

00:17:37.082 --> 00:17:40.260
STUDENT: If your-- like,
if your family gets sick,

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:41.508
and you are impacted by that.

00:17:41.508 --> 00:17:43.550
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, if
I care about my family,

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:46.790
in particular, if I
maximize family utility,

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:48.995
then it's not an externality.

00:17:48.995 --> 00:17:50.600
If I maximize not
my own utility,

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:58.360
but my family's utility, then
I will essentially internalize,

00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:04.230
internalize, the externality.

00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:08.100
Just like a lower wage means
that I bear the consequences

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:12.080
for being a less productive
worker, if I care

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.150
about my whole
family's happiness,

00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:17.540
and I make my kids
sick by smoking,

00:18:17.540 --> 00:18:19.280
then my smoking
decision will actually

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:22.040
reflect the total
consequences for my family.

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:24.290
I will smoke only if it's
optimal for my family for me

00:18:24.290 --> 00:18:24.790
to do so.

00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:26.150
It doesn't mean I won't smoke.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:27.170
It just means I must--

00:18:27.170 --> 00:18:29.230
I'll have to enjoy it
enough that it's worth

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:31.277
making my kids sick, OK?

00:18:31.277 --> 00:18:33.110
It doesn't mean that's
an incorrect decision

00:18:33.110 --> 00:18:35.240
because, after all, the
odds are you don't make

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:37.100
your kids that
sick, and, you know,

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.590
you might like
smoking a lot, OK?

00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:42.020
It's just that you will
internalize the externality

00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.120
because you only
smoke to the extent

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.320
that it is optimal
for the whole family.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.140
So it's not necessarily
an externality, OK?

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.050
So we'd like, actually, to test
whether it's an externality.

00:18:53.050 --> 00:18:55.790
There's actually a
clever test of this,

00:18:55.790 --> 00:18:58.960
which is there's a test of
whether people maximize family

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:04.690
utility, which is, if people
maximize family utility,

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:08.500
what would be the
implications of giving

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.370
a father $1 versus
giving a mother $1?

00:19:11.370 --> 00:19:12.745
If both the father
and the mother

00:19:12.745 --> 00:19:15.050
are maximizing a family
utility function,

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:17.050
the same family
utility function, then

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.340
should it matter whether I
give $1 to a father or $1

00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:20.530
to a mother?

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:22.853
No, it shouldn't because
that's $1 to the family.

00:19:22.853 --> 00:19:25.270
We're maximizing family utility
subject to a family budget

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.200
constraint.

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.460
It shouldn't matter
who gets the dollar.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.340
So one test of family
utility maximization

00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:33.650
is does it matter
who gets the money.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.960
And it turns out
it does a lot, OK?

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.110
So there was a
great test of this.

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:46.530
In the UK, they used to have a
tax system where, essentially,

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:48.520
there was a credit they
gave for every kid.

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:50.103
And the way the
credit worked is there

00:19:50.103 --> 00:19:52.850
would be a check sent home, OK?

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:53.870
Then they changed it.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:54.860
So, instead, they
said, well, instead

00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:56.318
of sending a check
home, we're just

00:19:56.318 --> 00:19:58.072
going to add it into
pay, into wages.

00:19:58.072 --> 00:19:59.780
So, instead of getting
a check sent home,

00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:01.450
we're just going to
raise your wages.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.260
Well, it had no effect
on family budgets.

00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.552
They literally just changed it.

00:20:04.552 --> 00:20:07.220
The difference was, back
in-- this was in the '70s.

00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:08.990
Men worked and women didn't.

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:11.980
So, when the check came
home, women controlled it.

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:14.558
But, when it was in
wages, men controlled it.

00:20:14.558 --> 00:20:16.350
So, if there's family
utility maximization,

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.430
it shouldn't matter.

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:19.180
But it turned out, as
soon as they changed

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.345
the way they paid it,
spending on kids went down,

00:20:21.345 --> 00:20:22.720
and spending on
drugs and alcohol

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:24.820
went up because,
basically, guys don't care

00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.410
about kids as much as women do.

00:20:26.410 --> 00:20:27.842
Sorry, guys.

00:20:27.842 --> 00:20:30.570
It's just-- I don't know what
the evolutionary biology is.

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:32.580
At least, in the
'70s, they didn't.

00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:35.027
So that's a rejection of
family utility maximization.

00:20:35.027 --> 00:20:36.610
Who had the dollars
actually mattered.

00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:37.985
It's kind of a
neat study for how

00:20:37.985 --> 00:20:39.718
you think about these theories.

00:20:39.718 --> 00:20:42.010
So it suggests that, secondhand
smoke, probably, people

00:20:42.010 --> 00:20:43.677
don't perfectly
maximize family utility.

00:20:43.677 --> 00:20:48.270
So there probably are
some externalities, OK?

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:50.250
So that's a negative
consumption externality.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:53.350
There can also, of course,
be positive externalities.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:59.020
So let's talk about a positive
consumption externality.

00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:01.120
Let's talk about my neighbor.

00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:05.030
I don't get along
with my neighbor, OK?

00:21:05.030 --> 00:21:07.580
And, partly, it's
because my neighbor

00:21:07.580 --> 00:21:09.710
has a habit of
starting big projects

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.450
and leaving them half done.

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:14.390
And, about 25 years
ago, 20 years ago,

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:17.140
he started a big project
to landscape his yard,

00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:19.130
created these huge
mounds of dirt

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:23.170
that I look at directly from
my kitchen, and then stopped.

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:27.650
So, for 20 years, I've had to
stare at huge mounds of dirt,

00:21:27.650 --> 00:21:28.640
OK?

00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:33.170
Now let's think about
my neighbor's decision

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:35.850
to go ahead and get rid
of those piles of dirt.

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:40.290
Let's say that that
would cost $1,000.

00:21:40.290 --> 00:21:44.310
So the cost is $1,000, OK?

00:21:44.310 --> 00:21:47.130
And let's say the
benefit to my neighbor

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:48.990
from doing so is clearly
less than $1,000,

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:50.320
or he would have done it.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:52.590
Let's say it's $800.

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.900
So that's why he leaves
those piles of dirt

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:56.840
because the cost is
$1,000 to remove them,

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.860
and it's only worth $800 to him.

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:02.080
But what he's not accounting
for is, if he removed them,

00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:09.020
there'd be a positive benefit
to me of another $300.

00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:11.180
So, actually, the
total social benefit

00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:15.540
of removing the dirt piles is
higher than the social cost.

00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:19.160
So, from a social
perspective, he should do it,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.410
but he doesn't because,
privately, it's

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:24.770
not optimal to do so.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:29.060
So that is a positive
consumption externality.

00:22:29.060 --> 00:22:29.660
Yeah?

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:32.230
STUDENT: Does this mean you'd
be willing to pay him like $200

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.730
to do it?

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:34.105
JONATHAN GRUBER:
Well, this leads

00:22:34.105 --> 00:22:38.270
to a very deep question, which
is can't all externalities

00:22:38.270 --> 00:22:40.070
simply be internalized.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:42.330
Let's take this example.

00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:47.230
Why can't I just go over
and offer to pay him, OK?

00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:49.480
Well, and, in fact, with
any example, we can do that.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.820
Why can't the fishermen just
go pay the steel plant, OK?

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.523
Why can't you pay me not
to smoke in class, OK?

00:22:58.523 --> 00:23:00.190
Indeed, with any of
these externalities,

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.942
there's a question why can't
they all be internalized.

00:23:02.942 --> 00:23:04.650
And, indeed, there's
a school of thought,

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.050
which suggests that
externalities aren't really

00:23:06.050 --> 00:23:06.550
a problem.

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:08.130
They can all just
be internalized.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.860
But, of course, that's
totally wrong, OK?

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.340
Let's start with a hard example.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.590
Let's talk about the biggest
environmental externality,

00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.960
which is global warming, OK?

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.980
With global warming, every
single time you drive,

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.740
you are bringing
people of Bangladesh

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.170
that much closer to
being under water.

00:23:30.170 --> 00:23:31.985
How could you possibly
negotiate that?

00:23:31.985 --> 00:23:34.610
How could you possibly negotiate
where the people of Bangladesh

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:35.970
would come and say, well,
drive a little bit less

00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:37.530
so I don't go under water?

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.010
OK, that's not happening, OK?

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:42.590
But, even with these simple
cases, think about this.

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:46.580
Why can't I just go to my
neighbor and offer him $200?

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:48.490
There's three problems.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:54.700
First problem is there's
the fact that I don't really

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.700
know what his costs are
and what his benefits are

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:01.620
and that I might--

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:05.450
I don't want to offer more than
I have to to get him to do it,

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.040
OK?

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.410
The second problem is he
doesn't know how I feel.

00:24:08.410 --> 00:24:10.120
So there's an
information asymmetry,

00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.703
which makes negotiations hard.

00:24:11.703 --> 00:24:13.120
There's a third
problem too, which

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:17.093
is it'd just be deeply
weird to do that, right?

00:24:17.093 --> 00:24:18.760
I mean, it's just not
how society works.

00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.800
You think about a classic
case of an externality you've

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.008
probably all run into, which
is your neighbor playing

00:24:23.008 --> 00:24:25.710
their music too loud, OK?

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:27.960
If your neighbor plays
their music too loud,

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.390
that is an externality
on you, OK?

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.390
Now, in principle, you
could go to your neighbor

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:36.420
and say, well, look,
I'm studying for a test.

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.100
This test will raise
my grade by 10 points.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.640
A higher grade in this
class will raise my earnings

00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.620
by $1,000.

00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.028
So I'm willing to pay you $83 to
stop playing music because I've

00:24:47.028 --> 00:24:48.570
calculated my lifetime
earning effect

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.210
of your playing the music.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.490
OK, even at MIT, that would
be sort of deeply weird to do.

00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:55.240
So what do you do?

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.590
You either shut up about
it, or you go yell at them.

00:24:58.590 --> 00:24:59.888
OK, but yelling induces--

00:24:59.888 --> 00:25:01.430
it's not necessarily
an efficient way

00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:03.690
to resolve it because maybe they
really want to play the music.

00:25:03.690 --> 00:25:05.420
The efficient thing would be,
if it's worth more than $83

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.045
for them to play the
music, they should

00:25:07.045 --> 00:25:08.930
get to play it and
just pay you $83.

00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:10.470
But, in fact, that doesn't work.

00:25:10.470 --> 00:25:12.470
So, in fact, private
solutions to these problems

00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:14.673
simply do not work, OK?

00:25:14.673 --> 00:25:17.090
It's just hard to figure out
how you can really get people

00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:23.945
privately to internalize
these externalities

00:25:23.945 --> 00:25:26.570
because negotiation is difficult
and because it's just socially

00:25:26.570 --> 00:25:27.320
awkward.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.940
There is a famous
apocryphal story

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.743
told of a famous economist
who was on a flight

00:25:31.743 --> 00:25:33.410
and wanted to get
work done and couldn't

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:35.618
because the person next to
him wouldn't stop talking.

00:25:35.618 --> 00:25:37.515
So they actually offered
them $10 to shut up.

00:25:37.515 --> 00:25:39.140
I don't believe that
actually happened,

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:42.240
but, you know, it makes
for a good story, OK?

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:44.120
So that's a positive
consumption externality.

00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:48.620
Finally, we have positive
production externalities.

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:53.940
The classic example of
a positive production

00:25:53.940 --> 00:26:00.420
externality is R&D
by private firms, OK?

00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:03.530
When a firm does
research and development,

00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:06.370
they don't just create
learning for themselves.

00:26:06.370 --> 00:26:09.750
They create learning that might
benefit other firms as well,

00:26:09.750 --> 00:26:10.630
OK?

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:12.610
And, indeed, the best
economic estimates

00:26:12.610 --> 00:26:16.080
suggest that the social
returns to $1 of R&D

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.840
are 2 and 1/2 times
the private returns,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:21.000
that every dollar
of R&D a firm does

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.170
benefits society
by 2 and 1/2 times

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:25.550
how much it benefits the firm.

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:31.130
And, as a result, firms
under invest in R&D, OK?

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:35.570
As a result, firms
under invest in R&D, OK?

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:39.318
And they are-- and
that's leading them to--

00:26:39.318 --> 00:26:41.610
that's leading to too little
R&D being done in society,

00:26:41.610 --> 00:26:43.790
and that affects all of us
because that affects growth.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:45.623
That's what my new book
Jumpstarting America

00:26:45.623 --> 00:26:46.400
is all about.

00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:47.942
It's about why we
need the government

00:26:47.942 --> 00:26:50.790
to come in and invest more in
R&D because firms under invest,

00:26:50.790 --> 00:26:51.350
OK?

00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:54.710
Essentially, firms don't
account for the spillovers

00:26:54.710 --> 00:26:56.910
that their investments
have on others.

00:26:56.910 --> 00:26:58.880
So a great example
used in the book

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:01.400
is the example of when
two drug companies were

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.705
racing to invent statins.

00:27:02.705 --> 00:27:04.580
You guys are too young
to know about statins,

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:07.472
but statins are basically
a cholesterol-lowering drug

00:27:07.472 --> 00:27:08.180
that's a miracle.

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:10.305
It saves hundreds of
thousands of lives every year.

00:27:10.305 --> 00:27:11.750
Best guess is
about 200,000 lives

00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.030
a year are saved by people
lowering their cholesterol

00:27:14.030 --> 00:27:15.380
through being on statins.

00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:17.630
Statins were being
invented in the early 1980s

00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.780
by two rival drug companies,
Merck in the US and Sankyo

00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:21.750
in Japan.

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.900
And they were racing to
develop these statins.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.632
And then Sankyo
suddenly stopped.

00:27:25.632 --> 00:27:27.340
And Merck found out
through the grapevine

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.450
it was because some
dogs got sick in drug--

00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:31.128
in the animal trials.

00:27:31.128 --> 00:27:32.670
And so Merck went
to Sankyo and said,

00:27:32.670 --> 00:27:34.040
hey, we heard some
dogs are sick.

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:34.707
What's going on?

00:27:34.707 --> 00:27:36.380
Sankyo said we're not
going to tell you.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.712
You're our competitor.

00:27:37.712 --> 00:27:39.170
So Merck offered
to pay them money.

00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:40.170
They offered to partner.

00:27:40.170 --> 00:27:41.545
Sankyo said no way.

00:27:41.545 --> 00:27:42.920
This is private
R&D, and we don't

00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.003
want to share it with you.

00:27:44.003 --> 00:27:45.990
So Merck stopped too.

00:27:45.990 --> 00:27:48.420
Five years later, some
academics got permission

00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.590
to run trials on statins.

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:51.210
It turns out that what happened
to the dogs had nothing

00:27:51.210 --> 00:27:52.265
to do with the drug.

00:27:52.265 --> 00:27:52.890
They were fine.

00:27:52.890 --> 00:27:54.060
It's totally safe.

00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:57.300
And statins were invented and
save 200,000 lives a year,

00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:59.160
but five years after
they should have.

00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:02.550
Literally, one
million people died

00:28:02.550 --> 00:28:04.080
because there was--
they could not

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.170
benefit from the spillovers
of R&D knowledge, OK?

00:28:07.170 --> 00:28:09.540
This is an example of what
we mean by under-investment

00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.682
in R&D, OK?

00:28:11.682 --> 00:28:13.890
So we have externalities
can be negative or positive.

00:28:13.890 --> 00:28:16.290
They can be production
side or consumption side.

00:28:16.290 --> 00:28:18.320
Questions about that?

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:18.860
Yeah?

00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:21.470
STUDENT: So, regardless if
they're negative or positive,

00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:23.500
externalities still
create deadweight loss.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.190
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yes,
regardless if they're

00:28:24.190 --> 00:28:26.030
negative or positive,
externalities still create

00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:27.947
deadweight loss because,
if they're positive--

00:28:27.947 --> 00:28:31.690
I should-- Jason,
just sent me a note.

00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:34.315
Next year, we should have in
the handout a positive graph.

00:28:34.315 --> 00:28:35.440
Well, I'll just do it here.

00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.030
I can-- I'm capable
of drawing a graph.

00:28:38.030 --> 00:28:42.400
So let's think about R&D. OK,
here's the quantity of R&D, OK?

00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:45.226
Here's the cost of
R&D, the price of R&D.

00:28:45.226 --> 00:28:47.090
So basically-- and here's the--

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:54.070
so here's going to be
the demand for R&D, OK?

00:28:54.070 --> 00:28:55.570
Here's going to be
the demand, which

00:28:55.570 --> 00:28:57.640
is private marginal benefit.

00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:03.753
And here's the supply, which is
the private marginal cost, OK?

00:29:03.753 --> 00:29:05.170
And let's just say
that there's no

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:07.340
externalities from actually--

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.065
this is a consumption
externality.

00:29:09.065 --> 00:29:11.360
This is a production
externality.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.410
So, basically, the point is
that, when a firm does R&D,

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:17.830
they do it until the
benefits to the firm

00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:19.340
equal the costs to the firm.

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:24.210
So they do an optimum-- they do
an amount of R&D of, you know,

00:29:24.210 --> 00:29:29.180
Q1 at a price of P1.

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.390
But what they're missing is
that, in fact, what they're

00:29:32.390 --> 00:29:36.980
missing is that
the costs to them

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:41.250
are actually well
below, well below,

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.710
what it truly costs because
they are benefiting others

00:29:43.710 --> 00:29:45.810
by doing it, OK?

00:29:45.810 --> 00:29:51.118
So the supply curve, the
true social supply curve,

00:29:51.118 --> 00:29:51.660
is down here.

00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:55.080
The social marginal cost is
the private marginal cost

00:29:55.080 --> 00:30:04.470
minus the social benefits that
we get from doing that R&D.

00:30:04.470 --> 00:30:08.920
So, as a result, they should be
doing Q2 R&D, but they're not.

00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.710
They're doing too
little R&D. And that's

00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:12.330
making a deadweight loss.

00:30:12.330 --> 00:30:14.640
The deadweight loss,
remember, is with reference

00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:15.870
to the optimal point.

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:17.770
This is the deadweight loss.

00:30:17.770 --> 00:30:20.640
This is deadweight loss
from under producing

00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.447
R&D. The difference between--

00:30:23.447 --> 00:30:24.030
no, I'm sorry.

00:30:24.030 --> 00:30:24.660
I got that wrong.

00:30:24.660 --> 00:30:26.180
These triangles are
always confusing.

00:30:26.180 --> 00:30:27.555
In the drawing,
I got that wrong.

00:30:27.555 --> 00:30:30.210
OK, it's the difference being
the social marginal cost,

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:32.160
between the social
marginal cost,

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.210
and the private
marginal benefit.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:37.845
So, basically, let me think
about this for one second.

00:30:37.845 --> 00:30:39.470
This is always a
little bit hard to do.

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:41.340
So, basically, there are units--

00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.220
there are units
they under produce.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.460
So, essentially, what their--
they should be producing this

00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:49.127
many units, yeah, between the--

00:30:49.127 --> 00:30:51.210
it's where the private
marginal-- yeah, it's this.

00:30:51.210 --> 00:30:53.130
I had it right.

00:30:53.130 --> 00:30:55.130
That's the deadweight loss, OK?

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:57.420
Yeah, so, basically,
what you have is

00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.670
you're going to have
underproduction of R&D,

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:02.490
just like you had
overproduction of steel, OK?

00:31:02.490 --> 00:31:03.574
Yeah?

00:31:03.574 --> 00:31:05.520
STUDENT: Why would the
social marginal cost

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:08.545
go down when the social
marginal benefit goes up?

00:31:08.545 --> 00:31:10.420
JONATHAN GRUBER: Because
the marginal benefit

00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:14.860
is what's the marginal benefit
of another dollar of R&D.

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:16.150
That's basically--

00:31:16.150 --> 00:31:19.540
that's, essentially, what's
the knowledge created, OK?

00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:21.840
You could view this either
way, but the idea here

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.520
is I'm producing R&D.
I'm not consuming R&D.

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.270
This is the benefit
of consuming R&D. This

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.187
is sort of the benefit
of society of consuming

00:31:28.187 --> 00:31:31.030
that R&D. So you think of it as
lowering the cost of producing

00:31:31.030 --> 00:31:34.610
the R&D is sort of the
way we think about it, OK?

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:36.590
But the main thing is not--

00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:37.176
yeah?

00:31:37.176 --> 00:31:39.765
STUDENT: So is the
marginal change

00:31:39.765 --> 00:31:45.200
between the social curve and the
private curve, is that linear?

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.192
Or, as it grows--

00:31:46.192 --> 00:31:47.900
JONATHAN GRUBER: That's
a great question.

00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:48.817
I'm always making it--

00:31:48.817 --> 00:31:49.790
I'm making it constant.

00:31:49.790 --> 00:31:52.760
I'm assuming marginal damage or
marginal benefits are constant.

00:31:52.760 --> 00:31:55.390
STUDENT: So, mathematically,
whichever triangle

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:56.805
you choose is the same?

00:31:56.805 --> 00:31:59.430
JONATHAN GRUBER: Yeah, exactly,
because I'm making it constant.

00:31:59.430 --> 00:32:01.097
And, in fact, you
could imagine it could

00:32:01.097 --> 00:32:03.290
be growing or shrinking, OK?

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.803
Now, with this in
mind and realizing

00:32:05.803 --> 00:32:07.970
that private sector can't
solve this for the reasons

00:32:07.970 --> 00:32:11.180
we talked about, let's
talk about the role--

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:14.531
let's talk about the
role of government,

00:32:14.531 --> 00:32:18.300
government solutions.

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:20.120
So, once again,
remember the basic logic

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:23.180
of this class, which is that--

00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:28.650
the basic logic of the
class, which is that if--

00:32:28.650 --> 00:32:31.670
the basic logic of the class
is that the market knows best

00:32:31.670 --> 00:32:33.072
unless there's a market failure.

00:32:33.072 --> 00:32:35.030
If there's a market
failure, the private market

00:32:35.030 --> 00:32:36.470
will deliver a deadweight loss.

00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:38.720
Now we have to ask can the
government actually make it

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.260
better.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:41.177
Remember, we talked about
monopoly regulation.

00:32:41.177 --> 00:32:44.743
The government may or may
not make it better, OK?

00:32:44.743 --> 00:32:47.160
Information asymmetries, it
may or may not make it better.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.320
Same thing with
externalities, the government

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.130
may not make it better.

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:51.213
So let's talk about how
the government, in theory,

00:32:51.213 --> 00:32:52.658
could make it better, OK?

00:32:52.658 --> 00:32:54.200
Well, there's two
ways the government

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.460
could make it better.

00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.100
One way is by regulation.

00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:03.350
So go back to figure 22-1, OK?

00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.480
The government could
literally regulate

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:08.240
and could say, look, we know
the optimal level of steel

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:10.290
to be produced is Q2.

00:33:10.290 --> 00:33:12.740
We're just going to
tell you to produce Q2.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:13.670
That's it.

00:33:13.670 --> 00:33:15.770
Problem solved, OK?

00:33:15.770 --> 00:33:18.290
We just say, hey, steel plant,
we know the optimum is Q2.

00:33:18.290 --> 00:33:19.010
You produce Q2.

00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.690
Problem solved.

00:33:20.690 --> 00:33:23.180
The problem with that is
that requires the government

00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:24.980
to know quite a lot.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.900
The government needs
to know both the supply

00:33:26.900 --> 00:33:31.310
and the demand curves to
figure out where Q2 is

00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:33.560
and what they should regulate.

00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:36.462
Let's say all the government
knows is the damage being done,

00:33:36.462 --> 00:33:37.920
and let's say the
damage is linear,

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:40.550
or they can approximate
it as linear.

00:33:40.550 --> 00:33:43.390
Then there's a much
easier solution,

00:33:43.390 --> 00:33:46.213
which is a corrective tax.

00:33:46.213 --> 00:33:47.880
What if the government
came in and said,

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.217
look, I don't where demand
and supply curves are?

00:33:50.217 --> 00:33:51.050
I don't really know.

00:33:51.050 --> 00:33:52.467
It's really hard
to figure it out.

00:33:52.467 --> 00:33:56.035
All I know is that, for every
unit of steel you produce,

00:33:56.035 --> 00:33:57.410
which is a unit
of sludge, you're

00:33:57.410 --> 00:34:00.348
killing $100 worth of fish.

00:34:00.348 --> 00:34:01.140
That's what I know.

00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:05.170
That I can study
environmentally, OK?

00:34:05.170 --> 00:34:08.040
What if I simply
tax the steel plant

00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.830
by $100 for every unit
of steel they produced?

00:34:10.830 --> 00:34:13.389
That is, if I imposed a
tax on the steel plant--

00:34:13.389 --> 00:34:14.763
STUDENT: Don't you mean sludge?

00:34:14.763 --> 00:34:16.180
JONATHAN GRUBER:
One unit of steel

00:34:16.180 --> 00:34:18.190
is one unit of sludge
in this example.

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:21.520
So I'm going to tax every
unit of steel they produce,

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.880
which is the same as producing
one unit of sludge, OK?

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:26.170
What if I impose that tax?

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.870
Well, let's look at figure 22-3.

00:34:28.870 --> 00:34:33.440
What does that do to
the firm's decision, OK?

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.940
Well, before the
government came in,

00:34:34.940 --> 00:34:37.380
the firm was
producing at point A

00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.130
where their private
marginal costs equaled

00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:40.588
the private marginal
benefit, which

00:34:40.588 --> 00:34:42.170
is the social marginal benefit.

00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:45.860
Now the government comes
in and levies a tax.

00:34:45.860 --> 00:34:49.903
It levies a tax at exactly
MD, the marginal damage.

00:34:49.903 --> 00:34:50.570
What does it do?

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:53.300
It shifts their private
marginal cost curve

00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.290
to the social
marginal cost curve.

00:34:56.290 --> 00:35:00.240
It has caused the firm to
internalize the externality

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.510
because now the firm is
paying an amount exactly

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:06.790
equal to the damage
they're doing to society.

00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:10.710
So a corrective tax
can cause the firm

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:14.090
to internalize the externality.

00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:18.128
Corrective tax caused the firm
to internalize the externality,

00:35:18.128 --> 00:35:18.960
OK?

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.270
Essentially, a corrective
tax by the government

00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:24.420
can get us to the right
answer because it gets firms

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:26.720
to do the right thing, OK?

00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:29.990
It gets firms to pay attention
to the social costs, not just

00:35:29.990 --> 00:35:31.340
the--

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.345
not just the private costs.

00:35:34.345 --> 00:35:35.720
Similarly, we
could do same thing

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.250
with a positive externality.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:40.950
What could the government do
with a positive externality?

00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:41.450
Yeah?

00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:42.350
STUDENT: Subsidize production.

00:35:42.350 --> 00:35:44.017
JONATHAN GRUBER: It
could subsidize by--

00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:48.380
so imagine I knew
exactly how much social

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:51.500
benefit there was per unit
of R&D. If I subsidized

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:55.560
the firm doing R&D, then I
would lower their costs, right?

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:58.100
If I offered them a
subsidy of this amount,

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.262
their cost curve
would shift down.

00:36:00.262 --> 00:36:01.220
I would lower the cost.

00:36:01.220 --> 00:36:04.110
So R&D would get
to the right point.

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.100
So a corrective tax of
the amount of damage

00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:09.590
gets firms to internalize
the externality.

00:36:09.590 --> 00:36:12.020
A corrective subsidy
of that amount

00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:15.530
gets firms to internalize the
externality or individuals

00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.480
to externalize the internality.

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:19.790
And we can get to
the optimal outcome

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:22.160
by the government
imposing a corrective tax

00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.820
or subsidy of the right amount.

00:36:23.820 --> 00:36:26.360
Now we could of course also
get there with regulation.

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:27.470
It's just a lot harder.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.410
Questions about that?

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:37.490
OK, this is our first
example of good taxes, OK?

00:36:37.490 --> 00:36:40.490
Taxes have been bad
throughout this course.

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:43.375
The role of taxes has been
distortionary to the economy.

00:36:43.375 --> 00:36:44.750
We haven't talked
about it a lot.

00:36:44.750 --> 00:36:46.792
We'll talk about it more
in a couple of lectures.

00:36:46.792 --> 00:36:48.840
They've been distortionary
to the economy.

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:51.110
This is saying, no,
a tax can actually

00:36:51.110 --> 00:36:55.250
play a positive role because
a tax can correct a market

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:57.120
failure.

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.180
Now, as always, if the
tax is set incorrectly,

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.748
it could make things worse.

00:37:00.748 --> 00:37:03.290
OK, if you set a tax that was
five times the marginal damage,

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:04.887
it would make things worse.

00:37:04.887 --> 00:37:07.220
But, if you set it correctly,
it can make things better.

00:37:07.220 --> 00:37:09.553
We're offering the potential
for government intervention

00:37:09.553 --> 00:37:11.070
to make things better here.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:13.400
Questions about that?

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:15.135
OK, so what do we have?

00:37:15.135 --> 00:37:17.260
We have a situation where
the private market is not

00:37:17.260 --> 00:37:21.120
delivering the optimal outcome.

00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.460
The private market is not
delivering the optimal outcome

00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:26.713
where it seems hard to
think of private solutions,

00:37:26.713 --> 00:37:29.130
but where a government solution,
either through regulation

00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:31.920
or easier corrective
taxation, can get us

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.000
to the optimal outcome.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.465
So now let's ask how does this
actually work in practice.

00:37:40.050 --> 00:37:41.760
And let's talk
about two examples.

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.430
Let's talk about environmental
externalities and health

00:37:44.430 --> 00:37:45.700
externalities.

00:37:49.965 --> 00:37:51.590
Start with environmental
externalities.

00:37:51.590 --> 00:37:53.630
And, of course,
the most important

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.685
is global warming, OK?

00:37:56.685 --> 00:37:59.060
Currently, the amount of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere

00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:03.770
is at its highest
level in 400,000 years.

00:38:03.770 --> 00:38:06.380
Basically, every year becomes
the hottest year on record

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.160
almost linearly.

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.610
Almost monotonically, every year
is the hottest year on record.

00:38:09.610 --> 00:38:10.318
We're heating up.

00:38:10.318 --> 00:38:13.228
Scientists predict
that it's possible--

00:38:13.228 --> 00:38:15.020
the central prediction
is that temperatures

00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:19.072
will rise by more than 2 degrees
Fahrenheit by the end of the--

00:38:19.072 --> 00:38:20.780
I'm sorry, by more
than 2 degrees Celsius

00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:26.460
by the end of the century, but
it could be more than that.

00:38:26.460 --> 00:38:28.850
There's actually,
currently, the best estimate

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:34.220
is that there's as
much as a 10% chance

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.960
that temperatures
go up by 10 degrees

00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.543
by the end of the
century, which would

00:38:37.543 --> 00:38:40.400
end human life, basically,
in most of the world, OK?

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:43.680
There is a non-trivial chance
we're all gone by 2100,

00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:46.190
not my problem, largely
not your problem,

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:48.880
certainly your
kids' problem, OK?

00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:52.310
OK, by and large,
we are basically--

00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:55.375
we are basically-- we have a--
we know for sure there's going

00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:56.840
to be negative implications.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.630
Basically, we are essentially--

00:38:59.630 --> 00:39:02.590
unless there's a radical
new technology invented,

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.920
Bangladesh is gone.

00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.180
It's over for Bangladesh.

00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.680
Cape Cod is gone.

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.910
Much of Florida is gone.

00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:09.830
That's already happening, OK?

00:39:09.830 --> 00:39:12.080
At this point, the
question is can we actually

00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.200
stop the entire East and West
coasts and much of the South

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.720
from disappearing as well
and many other countries

00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:20.360
in the world from
disappearing, OK?

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:23.600
That's the sort of decision
we have to make now, OK?

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.080
So, basically, this is a
classic negative externality

00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:28.825
because, that
negative situation,

00:39:28.825 --> 00:39:30.950
you were not thinking about
that when you filled up

00:39:30.950 --> 00:39:32.263
your car last time.

00:39:32.263 --> 00:39:33.680
You're not thinking
about the fact

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:35.222
that the fossil
fuels you're emitting

00:39:35.222 --> 00:39:36.710
are contributing to that, OK?

00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:39.690
It's a classic
negative externality.

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:41.060
So what can the government do?

00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:44.630
Well, the natural solution
would be corrective taxation.

00:39:44.630 --> 00:39:47.930
The natural solution would
be to have a carbon tax,

00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:50.570
to literally say this is
the amount-- we actually

00:39:50.570 --> 00:39:54.320
have a pretty good sense
from engineering models what

00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.030
the cost of carbon is, what the
marginal cost of carbon is, OK?

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:01.190
And we could
literally impose a tax

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:04.167
on the use of carbon
of that amount.

00:40:04.167 --> 00:40:05.750
I think it would
amount to something--

00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:06.860
I don't know the
numbers these days.

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:09.230
It's something like between
$0.25 and $0.50 a gallon

00:40:09.230 --> 00:40:10.580
of gas.

00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:12.860
So it's a lot, but it's not--

00:40:12.860 --> 00:40:14.480
we've seen gas prices
in the last year

00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:16.200
go up and down by that much.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.168
OK, that's not an
outrageous amount, OK?

00:40:19.168 --> 00:40:20.960
In Europe, they already
have gasoline taxes

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.510
well above that level, OK?

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:27.923
So corrective taxation, in
principle, could be the answer.

00:40:27.923 --> 00:40:29.840
We could literally just
use engineering models

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:32.760
to compute the costs,
social costs of carbon.

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.350
We could put a tax on it.

00:40:34.350 --> 00:40:37.740
And then at least we would stop
global warming going forward.

00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.370
You know, Bangladesh
may be gone,

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:43.170
but we can maybe save a lot
of the rest of the world, OK?

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:45.810
So that's in theory.

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:48.390
In practice, in
1994, Bill Clinton

00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:53.040
proposed a $0.03 gas tax
and lost Congress, OK?

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.550
In practice, people
don't like gas taxes.

00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.890
It's very hard politically
in the US and other places.

00:40:59.890 --> 00:41:03.220
And that is why the world has
turned to a different approach,

00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.310
which is quantity
regulation, which

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:08.490
is say, look, in practice, we
should have a global carbon

00:41:08.490 --> 00:41:09.033
tax.

00:41:09.033 --> 00:41:10.950
In theory, we should
have a global carbon tax.

00:41:10.950 --> 00:41:11.992
In practice, that's hard.

00:41:11.992 --> 00:41:14.700
That's why we have negotiations.

00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:17.040
That's why we try to
have a global negotiation

00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.770
to try to get a global
cap on carbon emissions,

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:23.445
actually have a quantity
regulation, to actually have

00:41:23.445 --> 00:41:25.110
a quantity regulation.

00:41:25.110 --> 00:41:25.860
We started this.

00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:27.510
The first true
global negotiation

00:41:27.510 --> 00:41:32.857
was in Kyoto, Japan
in December 1997.

00:41:32.857 --> 00:41:35.190
I was fortunate enough to be
there for that negotiation.

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:37.260
I was in the Clinton
administration at the time.

00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:41.320
And we got to go over
and do that negotiation.

00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.320
It was actually pretty
neat because they decided

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:44.850
I was going at the last
minute, and the only plane left

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:45.975
to go on was Air Force Two.

00:41:45.975 --> 00:41:48.350
So I got to fly over with the
vice president on Air Force

00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:50.240
Two, which was pretty
cool, super cool.

00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:51.520
They have really
nice seats and stuff.

00:41:51.520 --> 00:41:53.562
And so I sat down, and
the phone next to me rang.

00:41:53.562 --> 00:41:54.517
And I was like--

00:41:54.517 --> 00:41:55.100
I answered it.

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:55.640
I was like hello.

00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:56.640
They're like, hey, John.

00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:57.510
I'm like oh my god.

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:59.610
It was them calling from
Japan, but like getting

00:41:59.610 --> 00:42:02.190
a personal phone call on
a plane was super cool.

00:42:02.190 --> 00:42:03.930
So, anyway, so I
went over to Kyoto.

00:42:03.930 --> 00:42:07.890
I learned how these negotiations
work, which is, over five days,

00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:10.440
I slept four hours.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.090
In Japan, they sell--

00:42:12.090 --> 00:42:14.020
they sold, at the time,
this coffee in cans.

00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:16.325
So you just chug these
cans of coffee all the time

00:42:16.325 --> 00:42:16.950
and stay awake.

00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:19.325
And, basically, everyone is
so tired by the end they just

00:42:19.325 --> 00:42:20.880
agree just to kind
of get it done.

00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.550
And that's sort of way
that negotiations work.

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:25.590
So we agreed to the
Kyoto global warming

00:42:25.590 --> 00:42:28.660
treaty, which would have
lowered emissions worldwide,

00:42:28.660 --> 00:42:30.990
but the US did not sign on.

00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:33.438
The US refused to sign on.

00:42:33.438 --> 00:42:34.980
There's been continuing
negotiations.

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:37.770
Most recently, we know about
the Paris round of negotiations,

00:42:37.770 --> 00:42:40.440
which the US did sign on to,
but the current administration

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.420
has pulled us back out of.

00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.730
So we have a problem, which
is that, basically, we're

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.160
heading to this
environmental catastrophe,

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:52.380
and the world can't
agree on actions to take.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:57.000
And it's not really a choice.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.450
I mean, we have to do something,
or our grandkids will all

00:43:00.450 --> 00:43:02.580
be under water, or
our great-grandkids

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.870
will all be under water.

00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:05.850
We have to do something.

00:43:05.850 --> 00:43:08.400
The optimistic case
that we'll do something

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.220
comes from the example of what's
called chlorofluorocarbons.

00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:13.048
When I was a kid,
many, many products

00:43:13.048 --> 00:43:15.090
were made with what's
called chlorofluorocarbons.

00:43:15.090 --> 00:43:16.390
They were in refrigerators.

00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:19.440
They were in aerosol
sprays, et cetera.

00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:21.090
Scientists realized
they were actually

00:43:21.090 --> 00:43:23.040
damaging the ozone
layer, which protects us

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:25.458
from ultraviolet
rays from the sun.

00:43:25.458 --> 00:43:27.000
And people were
like, yeah, whatever,

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.458
much like they are with global
warming now, yeah, whatever.

00:43:29.458 --> 00:43:32.550
But then a fucking hole
opened up in the ozone layer.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:34.710
Like, literally, it was
like, oh my god, there's

00:43:34.710 --> 00:43:36.090
a hole in the ozone layer.

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:38.160
And 180 countries got
together almost overnight

00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.647
and banned chlorofluorocarbons.

00:43:39.647 --> 00:43:41.730
Like, literally, almost
overnight, they were gone.

00:43:41.730 --> 00:43:43.853
It was amazing,
international cooperation,

00:43:43.853 --> 00:43:45.270
terrific international
cooperation

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.370
to take an environmental
catastrophe on and deal

00:43:47.370 --> 00:43:47.870
with it.

00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:49.662
The problem is global
warming doesn't quite

00:43:49.662 --> 00:43:50.790
work that way, OK?

00:43:50.790 --> 00:43:53.610
By the time we say, oh my god,
Bangladesh is under water,

00:43:53.610 --> 00:43:55.265
it's too late.

00:43:55.265 --> 00:43:56.640
So the question
is sort of how do

00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:58.553
we get politicians
and the public

00:43:58.553 --> 00:44:00.720
interested in taking something
on when we don't have

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.060
the symbol, like a hole
in the ozone layer,

00:44:03.060 --> 00:44:06.600
to actually represent the
damage that's being done.

00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:09.360
And that is the challenge facing
something like global warming,

00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:12.450
but we have to take it on, OK?

00:44:12.450 --> 00:44:14.142
So that's environmental
externalities.

00:44:14.142 --> 00:44:15.600
The other big type
of externalities

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.190
are health externalities,
are health externalities.

00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:26.660
I talked about smoking,
but, indeed, there

00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:29.090
are huge externalities levied
by a bunch of activities

00:44:29.090 --> 00:44:31.230
that we do that
impact our health.

00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:35.680
So, for example,
drinking, drunk driving

00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.730
causes 13,000 deaths per
year, 13,000 deaths per year,

00:44:40.730 --> 00:44:45.160
OK, to put a sort of blunt face
on it, four 9/11s every year

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:49.750
from drunk driving plus
400,000 injuries every year

00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:52.540
from people driving drunk.

00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:57.910
Consuming gasoline, global
warming is a huge externality.

00:44:57.910 --> 00:45:00.370
Perhaps one of the biggest
externalities facing us,

00:45:00.370 --> 00:45:03.190
the biggest social
externality, is obesity, OK?

00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:06.400
Obesity causes a
lot of illnesses

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.170
that cost a lot of money.

00:45:08.170 --> 00:45:10.930
Projections are that children
born in the year 2000,

00:45:10.930 --> 00:45:15.250
so about your kid, about your
generation, one third of them

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:18.400
will get diabetes before they
die based on current weight

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.260
projections.

00:45:19.260 --> 00:45:21.400
Now, as you notice,
looking around this room,

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.900
that's not a problem of the
elite East Coast people, OK?

00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:27.400
It's not a problem of-- it's a
problem of the less educated.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.370
It's a problem concentrated
more in the South,

00:45:30.370 --> 00:45:33.910
but, nonetheless, if you look
at a number of southern states,

00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:36.970
the obesity rate is above 35%.

00:45:36.970 --> 00:45:39.670
Literally, more than one in
three people in the state

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.530
are obese, OK?

00:45:41.530 --> 00:45:44.590
This is a huge problem, and it's
going to cause huge social--

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:47.180
it's going to have huge social
consequences for our country.

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.710
The question is what
do we do about these.

00:45:48.710 --> 00:45:50.877
What do we do about things
like smoking and drinking

00:45:50.877 --> 00:45:52.000
and obesity?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.560
And there's essentially--
there's, essentially,

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.160
four answers.

00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:00.310
The first is information.

00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:03.130
Can we just inform
people about the damages?

00:46:03.130 --> 00:46:06.970
And, indeed, this has been
shown to work with smoking.

00:46:06.970 --> 00:46:11.290
OK, we knew smoking was bad
for you in about 1954, OK?

00:46:11.290 --> 00:46:13.450
But we only really
got through to people

00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:16.610
starting really in
the 1970s and '80s,

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.010
but it's had an enormous effect.

00:46:18.010 --> 00:46:19.940
Smoking has fallen
incredibly in the US

00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.110
through that information.

00:46:21.110 --> 00:46:23.230
But here's the
interesting thing, OK?

00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:27.297
Smoking rates-- smoking used
to be 50% in the entire--

00:46:27.297 --> 00:46:28.880
every adult, 50% of
all adults smoked.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:31.360
It didn't matter race,
gender, class, whatever.

00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:33.040
Now smoking is
essentially down to zero

00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:35.050
among the well-educated
and still about 20%

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:36.760
against the less educated.

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:39.580
So information
works, but it works

00:46:39.580 --> 00:46:42.950
in a very inequitable way.

00:46:42.950 --> 00:46:45.200
OK, so information
is one solution.

00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:47.830
The second solution is taxation.

00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:53.310
And, indeed, this has been shown
to work for cigarettes once

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:55.190
again.

00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:57.250
Smoking is price sensitive.

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:59.455
The elasticity of smoking
with respect to the price

00:46:59.455 --> 00:47:01.600
is about minus 0.4.

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:04.300
About every 10% you raise
the price of cigarettes,

00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:06.160
there's about 4% less smoking.

00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:06.880
It works.

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:10.890
In particular, youth smoking
is very price sensitive.

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:13.610
Youths are very price sensitive
because youths have less money.

00:47:13.610 --> 00:47:16.570
So they're very price sensitive.

00:47:16.570 --> 00:47:18.940
So it actually works.

00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:20.348
But that's sort
of the easy case.

00:47:20.348 --> 00:47:22.390
Taxing cigarettes is easy
because every cigarette

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:23.320
is bad for you.

00:47:23.320 --> 00:47:25.900
Taxing alcohol is trickier
because, after all,

00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.780
most of the damage is done
by a tiny share of drinkers.

00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:32.050
Most of us will consume alcohol
responsibly most of our lives

00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.072
and not cause any
external damage, OK?

00:47:34.072 --> 00:47:36.530
But most of the damage is done
by a tiny share of drinking.

00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:37.650
So taxes is trickier.

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:39.400
If I proposed a big
rise in alcohol taxes,

00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:40.690
people would say wait a second.

00:47:40.690 --> 00:47:41.690
I'm responsible drinker.

00:47:41.690 --> 00:47:42.653
Why are you taxing--

00:47:42.653 --> 00:47:43.570
why are you taxing me?

00:47:43.570 --> 00:47:44.903
So that's a little bit trickier.

00:47:44.903 --> 00:47:46.480
Not to mention
obesity, taxing food

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:48.580
is maybe the
trickiest of all, OK?

00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:50.850
So taxes are trickier.

00:47:50.850 --> 00:47:52.910
You could maybe try--

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:55.320
an alternative thing you
could do is penalties.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.750
So, instead of
taxing alcohol, we

00:47:57.750 --> 00:48:00.327
could just steepen the
penalties for drunk driving.

00:48:00.327 --> 00:48:02.160
You know, if you killed
a few drunk drivers,

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.620
there would be less
drunk driving, OK?

00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:07.050
But the problem is that's
a pretty extreme penalty.

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:07.920
And what if you got it wrong?

00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.360
You'd feel kind of bad
about killing someone

00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.130
because the breathalyzer
didn't work.

00:48:11.130 --> 00:48:12.180
There was a series of
articles, actually,

00:48:12.180 --> 00:48:14.597
in The New York Times about
how terrible breathalyzers are

00:48:14.597 --> 00:48:16.590
and how inaccurate they are, OK?

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:19.900
So problem with penalties is we
can't enforce them perfectly,

00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:20.640
OK?

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:21.872
So that's the third solution.

00:48:21.872 --> 00:48:24.330
The final solution and the one
that's really most discussed

00:48:24.330 --> 00:48:28.050
right now is illegality.

00:48:28.050 --> 00:48:29.800
What if we just made
these things illegal?

00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.340
And this comes to the
discussion of marijuana.

00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:36.380
Should marijuana be legal, OK?

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:42.350
Well, illegality is an extreme
form of lowering externalities.

00:48:42.350 --> 00:48:43.850
Now, obviously,
when pot is illegal,

00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:45.317
people still smoke pot.

00:48:45.317 --> 00:48:47.150
But it's still true,
when you make it legal,

00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:49.080
it's consumed at
much higher levels.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.880
OK, legality does matter.

00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.880
So, for example, people
have done studies.

00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:55.197
Yes, people under 21
drink, but, literally,

00:48:55.197 --> 00:48:57.530
if you look at people the day
after their 21st birthday,

00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:59.450
they drink much more than
the day before their 21st.

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:01.242
Not on the 21st birthday,
that's the party.

00:49:01.242 --> 00:49:01.867
We ignore that.

00:49:01.867 --> 00:49:04.117
But, the day after their
21st birthday and thereafter,

00:49:04.117 --> 00:49:06.350
they're drinking at much
higher levels than before.

00:49:06.350 --> 00:49:08.303
Legality matters, OK?

00:49:08.303 --> 00:49:10.220
It's also true, the day
after a 21st birthday,

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:12.428
people are much more likely
to die in a drunk driving

00:49:12.428 --> 00:49:15.680
accident than the day before
their 21st birthday, OK?

00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.280
So legality matters.

00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.890
So the point is we
have a whole series

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:20.660
of tools to think about this.

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:23.490
And the question is how should
we combine and use them.

00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:26.690
And the answer is
take 14.41, and I'll

00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:27.950
teach you all about it.

00:49:27.950 --> 00:49:29.510
But we don't any more time here.

00:49:29.510 --> 00:49:32.390
This just raises the issues to
think about with externalities.

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:33.830
It's an important topic
to think about it.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:35.760
I realize that's a lot
to cover in one lecture,

00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:36.380
but I just wanted
to sort of give you

00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.300
a taste for how
economists think about

00:49:38.300 --> 00:49:41.050
and analyze this kind
of market failure.

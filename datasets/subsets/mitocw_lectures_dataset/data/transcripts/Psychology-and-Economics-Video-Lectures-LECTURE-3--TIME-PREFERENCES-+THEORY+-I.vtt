FRANK SCHILBACH: Welcome
to lecture three.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.010
Today and on
Wednesday, we're going

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.820
to talk about time preferences
and particular theory.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.150
We're going to talk a lot
about a lot of applications,

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.030
a lot of applications
that are sort of close

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.390
to your real world, including
procrastination of problem

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.740
sets, all sorts of other choices
such as credit card debt,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.810
and so on, and so forth.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:37.580
Can you be a little quiet?

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.340
Thank you.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.760
Think of the lectures
today and on Wednesday

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.070
building some framework
and some sort of structure

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.690
and how to think
about these things.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.570
It's a little drier than
maybe other lectures, in part

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.630
because it's about theory, and
about writing down a model,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.580
and trying to think
about the world.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.600
Partially we're doing
that to sort of try

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.730
to explain behaviors
that we see in the world,

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.080
partially we do that
because at the end,

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.840
we try to think
about welfare and how

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.489
to evaluate certain
outcomes-- is

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.010
that good or bad-- certain
policies and things to do,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.830
which later in the course
we're going to talk about.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.480
But for that you,
need some structure

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.060
how to think about
some of those things.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.770
At the heart of
it, a lot of this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.280
is about procrastination, about
choices between the present

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.600
and the future.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.140
Your problem set, in part, is
also about procrastination.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.560
It will be posted later
today, probably late.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.050
Please do let us know if
you have any questions.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:35.413
As I said, please be on time.

00:01:35.413 --> 00:01:36.080
Do the readings.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.150
There will be
random pop quizzes.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.080
They will be at the
beginning of the class,

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.430
so you should be on time.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.055
The laptop section
is still over there.

00:01:45.055 --> 00:01:47.555
If you want to use your laptop,
it should be there, ideally,

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:49.310
in the front, in part
because you're not

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.980
going to bother others.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.930
I saw quite a few people
using their phones

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.800
in class in previous classes.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.590
Try to not do that.

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.120
That's not good for you.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.720
You will not be able to take
away much from the class.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.240
Multitasking is very
hard for people to do.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.640
Again, I'll show you
some evidence on that.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.220
As I said, the problem set
will be posted shortly.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.270
If you have any questions,
please do let us know on Piazza

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.570
and help others answer them
or answer them for others.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.960
I have office hours,
usually Tuesday afternoons.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.025
Please sign up for them.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:23.150
I'm very happy to meet you.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.490
It's very hard for me to meet
people or get to know you

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.898
in the large class otherwise.

00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:31.190
So please come to office hours.

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.400
I'm happy to talk to
you about anything

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.260
you're interested
in, ideally related

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.650
to behavioral economics.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.730
So let me give you an overview
of this and the next lecture.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.530
We're going to talk first
about exponential discounting.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.450
Why are we talking about
exponential discount?

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.440
This is the workhorse model
of classical economics.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.220
This is how economists usually
think about choices over time.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.600
Second, we're going to identify
some problems with this model,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.030
and try to think about why
is this model perhaps not

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.160
explaining things well,
at least in some settings?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.940
And how could we
improve on that?

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.480
I'm going to propose an
alternative model, which

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.970
is the quasi-hyperbolic
discounting model.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.160
And then we're going to
talk about sophistication

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.730
and naivete, which is the
idea that if you think

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:22.160
you have different preferences
in the present form

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.248
in the future, then it becomes
very important to understand.

00:03:25.248 --> 00:03:26.790
Do you actually know
what's going on?

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.630
Do you know that in the
future you might be impatient,

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.210
or do you perhaps think
that in the future,

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.690
I will be very patient,
and then perhaps make

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.070
some mistakes accordingly?

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.190
I'll get to this in more detail.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.980
So it's first
important to notice

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.650
that any choice, essentially
almost any choice you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.450
make, almost always involves
some choice over time.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.360
Essentially, some trade-off
between the present,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.710
between some cost and
benefit that you might occur

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.250
in the very short run, and
some costs and benefits

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.260
that you might enjoy
or incur in the future.

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.460
What examples do we have?

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:05.960
What choices over
time do we face?

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.780
Yes.

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.241
STUDENT: Savings
versus consumption.

00:04:11.241 --> 00:04:12.241
FRANK SCHILBACH: Uh-huh.

00:04:12.241 --> 00:04:14.832
And how do you decide
how much to save?

00:04:14.832 --> 00:04:17.040
STUDENT: Depending on your
preferences and interests,

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.621
right?

00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:19.579
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.510
So you have the
choice, for example,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.770
if you think about should I
save some money, let's say,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.440
for next semester or next year.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.820
So your choice is either
to consume the money now

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.440
in various ways--
eat food or whatever

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.060
you would like to do with it,
spend it on various activities.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.102
So if you save, if you
make the decision to save,

00:04:38.102 --> 00:04:40.250
you have to give
up some money now,

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.620
and you get some
benefits in the future.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.022
The benefits in the future
are determined by the interest

00:04:46.022 --> 00:04:46.730
rate, as you say.

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:48.480
If you have a savings
account or the like,

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.890
you can essentially get
some benefits in the future.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.675
And then you have some
costs in the present, which

00:04:54.675 --> 00:04:56.300
would be essentially
not consuming now,

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.342
and some benefits in the
future, which is getting

00:04:58.342 --> 00:04:59.690
that money in the future.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.810
And then you need to somehow
decide is that worth doing.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.060
There's some cost and benefit.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.490
We need to aggregate somehow,
whether to make that choice.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.290
Any other choices
you make over time?

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:18.623
Yes.

00:05:18.623 --> 00:05:20.290
STUDENT: Whether to
go to college or not

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:22.248
or start working right
away and make some money

00:05:22.248 --> 00:05:25.772
or delay that income.

00:05:25.772 --> 00:05:26.730
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.098
So I actually have this
example here-- going to school.

00:05:29.098 --> 00:05:30.390
It has some costs and benefits.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.510
And what are the costs and
benefits of doing that?

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.486
STUDENT: You
sacrifice four years

00:05:36.486 --> 00:05:39.421
or whatever right
now versus supposedly

00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:41.758
a higher income later on.

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:42.800
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.390
So you have direct
costs of education,

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.580
which is tuition in many cases.

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.830
Sometimes that's sponsored,
but often there's tuition.

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:50.190
It's quite a bit of money.

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:53.030
It's also the opportunity cost,
which is often forgone wages.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.440
You could be working
otherwise and make more money.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.478
There's the joy of pain
of going to school.

00:05:57.478 --> 00:05:58.770
Some might think it's positive.

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.230
Some might think it's negative.

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:03.060
And then there's future
wages, which in many cases,

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.150
at least for you
guys, tend to be

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.840
higher from going to college.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.890
If you do a PhD, that
might not be the case.

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.020
I'm not sure if the
TA's are here, but yes.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.860
I'm sorry for that.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:16.880
And then you have to decide
are you going to school or not.

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.460
What do you need to do
is you need to determine

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.100
the utility, the value of each
of these costs and benefits.

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.117
And they occur in
different points in time.

00:06:25.117 --> 00:06:26.450
You need to make some estimates.

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:28.610
And then, of course, there's
risk and other issues involved.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:30.568
You might not have full
information, and so on.

00:06:30.568 --> 00:06:32.090
But assuming that
all away, suppose

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.700
you knew all the costs and
benefits of going to college.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.710
Then you have to decide,
is that worth doing?

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.400
So somehow you need to aggregate
these costs and benefits

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.260
over time by putting
appropriate weights

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:44.730
on different periods
in time, and decide,

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:46.900
should I do this or not.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.020
OK.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.410
Yes, any other similar
choices that people make?

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:59.310
Yes.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:03.032
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:03.032 --> 00:07:03.990
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.100
For example, you
could think about

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.030
should I do a problem set?

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:07.020
Should I come to class?

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.968
Should I study for
an exam, and so on.

00:07:09.968 --> 00:07:11.760
Often, there's costs
and benefits involved.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:13.770
Often, the costs are immediate.

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.270
You have to work
on the problem set.

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.395
That might not be pleasant.

00:07:16.395 --> 00:07:17.700
You have to study for the exam.

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.990
That might not be pleasant.

00:07:18.990 --> 00:07:21.990
You could be doing other
things instead that you

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:23.950
can't do because of that.

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:26.430
And then there's going to
be rewards in the future,

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:29.760
usually in the terms either
through increased knowledge

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:32.010
that might be useful for
other things in the future,

00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:37.020
or through better grades, or
whatever you might be rewarded

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:39.960
from having more knowledge.

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.240
And then, again, there might
be uncertainty involved

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.450
because it could be that you
might not fully know what

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:46.800
the costs and benefits are.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.300
It could be that
it's sort of risky.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.550
You might come to class or
not come to class depending

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:54.930
on whether there's a pop quiz or
not, so there's risk involved.

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:56.970
But assuming that away,
there's essentially

00:07:56.970 --> 00:08:01.140
benefits and costs
in the present,

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:03.820
and then benefits and costs,
potentially, in the future.

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.050
And again, somehow you have to
aggregate these and weigh them

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.560
in various ways.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.395
Any other choices?

00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:16.520
Yes.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:17.270
STUDENT: Exercise.

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:18.978
FRANK SCHILBACH:
Exercise, yeah, exactly.

00:08:18.978 --> 00:08:20.020
Exercise is a good one.

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:23.540
Again, in the present,
you might not enjoy it.

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:25.490
Some people might
actually enjoy it a lot.

00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:27.073
Somebody would tell
me he was addicted

00:08:27.073 --> 00:08:29.360
to exercise-- that also happens.

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.179
But usually, people, at
least in the short run,

00:08:32.179 --> 00:08:34.110
tend to not like
exercise that much.

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:38.690
But I think it's useful for
them to do, in part because they

00:08:38.690 --> 00:08:40.940
feel better afterwards,
in part because they

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.382
have long-run benefits.

00:08:42.382 --> 00:08:44.090
Maybe they're in better
shape eventually.

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:45.230
Maybe the healthier eventually.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:47.270
Maybe they'll live longer
eventually, and so on, and so

00:08:47.270 --> 00:08:47.940
forth.

00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:49.040
And again, what
you need to do is

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.360
you have some
costs and benefits.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.700
You have the costs of getting
ready, getting out of the door,

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:53.950
and getting yourself to do it.

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:55.340
That often is costly.

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:58.700
There's the cost of exercising
itself, which often is costly,

00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.323
maybe not.

00:08:59.323 --> 00:09:01.240
But then the benefits
are often in the future,

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.095
often really far
away in the future.

00:09:03.095 --> 00:09:04.970
So if you really were
eating healthier, often

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:05.720
the same thing--

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.620
essentially, you might not like
eating spinach and vegetables

00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:11.120
in the present.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.393
Some people, of
course, love that,

00:09:13.393 --> 00:09:14.810
but often, then,
the benefits come

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:19.465
in the form of improved
health many, many years out.

00:09:19.465 --> 00:09:20.840
And again, what
you need to do is

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.240
you need to quantify somehow
the costs and benefits

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.380
of certain actions.

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.280
And then you need to aggregate
the costs and benefits somehow,

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.200
to be able to make a choice.

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:31.700
Is that a good
idea or a bad idea?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.298
Do you want to do this or not?

00:09:34.298 --> 00:09:36.590
A number of different examples--
here's another example

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:39.320
of something that's
very trivial--

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.180
purchasing an
expensive software.

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.920
You have to spend some
money of doing it.

00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.850
That usually entails
negative utility.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:46.610
People don't like
to give up money.

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:48.440
Second, there's
pain and frustration

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:49.520
of learning the software.

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.530
Again, that's often
negative utility.

00:09:51.530 --> 00:09:53.390
And then there's
mastery, which is

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:56.270
positive utility from knowing
or learning the software,

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.630
until it becomes obsolete.

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:00.867
So there's a stream of positive
utility sometime in the future.

00:10:00.867 --> 00:10:03.200
Now, how do you decide whether
to purchase the software?

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.300
Well, you determine the
value of the utility

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.600
of costs and benefits somehow.

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.248
And we're going to talk about
in some degree how to do that.

00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:10.790
And then once you
have that, you need

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:13.340
to weigh the costs and
benefits, and try to aggregate,

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:16.310
and try to figure out, is
this a good idea or not.

00:10:16.310 --> 00:10:18.833
There's another choice,
which we're actually

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.750
going to talk about when
we talk about welfare

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:21.740
and about policies.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:24.350
Overall, it's deactivating a
social media account, in part

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:26.308
because there's a very
nice study that actually

00:10:26.308 --> 00:10:27.510
studies precisely that.

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:30.140
So if you think about
deactivating a social media

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:31.670
account--

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:35.450
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram,
whatever people are using--

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.120
there's different costs
and benefits involved.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.940
And you can argue
about what those are.

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:43.620
Part of that is the direct cost
of deactivating the account.

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:45.120
Often, that's a
tedious thing to do.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.620
You have to figure
out how to do it.

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.680
Often, companies try
to not make it too easy

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:50.172
for you to actually do that.

00:10:50.172 --> 00:10:52.380
You might want to archive
some pictures, or whatever,

00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:52.880
and so on.

00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:54.530
Often, that's a
tedious thing to do.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:56.330
There's often a short-run
adjustment cost,

00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:58.160
where you want to be in
touch with your friends.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.327
Maybe it's harder to find
out where the parties are,

00:11:00.327 --> 00:11:02.390
or whatever,
whatever things are.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:04.520
So often, there's some
adjustment cost, likely also

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.277
negative.

00:11:05.277 --> 00:11:06.860
And then there is
some long-run impact

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:08.652
on your social life,
on your mental health,

00:11:08.652 --> 00:11:10.160
on your happiness,
and so on, that

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.170
could be positive or negative.

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.540
Assuming that perhaps
a positive, then again,

00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.660
you have to think about
short-run negative costs

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:18.440
and benefits.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.607
You have to learn about,
think about what those are.

00:11:20.607 --> 00:11:22.003
Again, they might be uncertain.

00:11:22.003 --> 00:11:24.170
But to the extent that you
could tell what they are,

00:11:24.170 --> 00:11:26.923
then you have costs and benefits
at different points in time.

00:11:26.923 --> 00:11:28.340
And when you make
that choice, you

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.160
have to figure
out whether that's

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:35.720
worth doing by aggregating them
somehow to some point in time

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.090
and, saying yes,
I'll do it, or not.

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.760
And we'll get back
to this in, I think,

00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:42.990
something like lecture
20 or so, where

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.230
there is a study that was
encouraging people to, in fact,

00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:50.390
precisely do that, and look at
happiness and other outcomes,

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:53.810
mental health, and so
on, among students.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.995
OK, so what are other
important choices over time?

00:11:55.995 --> 00:11:58.370
If you think about almost
anything that you can think of,

00:11:58.370 --> 00:12:02.120
any choice that you make in
your life, almost any of these

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.400
involve some aspects of time.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:07.160
So if you think about investing,
saving, borrowing, credit card

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:10.220
spending, and so on, that
involves choices over time.

00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:12.170
If you think about
education, often, there's

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:14.485
costs in the present,
benefits in the future.

00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:16.610
If you think about any sort
of health investments--

00:12:16.610 --> 00:12:19.490
eating healthy, taking
your medication,

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.600
brushing your teeth, exercising,
and so on, if you think

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:25.498
about sleeping,
often sleep involves

00:12:25.498 --> 00:12:27.290
choices between the
present and the future.

00:12:27.290 --> 00:12:29.730
You think about watching movies
at night-- that's fun to do.

00:12:29.730 --> 00:12:31.897
But often, that comes out
like pain on the following

00:12:31.897 --> 00:12:33.830
day in various forms.

00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.962
Eating patterns as
well, dating arguably

00:12:36.962 --> 00:12:38.420
involves sort of
costs and benefits

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.810
in the present and the future.

00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.060
People make different choices.

00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.770
Again, there's all sorts of
other aspects involved as well,

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:46.110
including risk,
information, and so on.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.312
But what I'm pointing
out is many choices

00:12:48.312 --> 00:12:50.270
that people make have
some aspects that involve

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.530
different points in time.

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:54.680
And you have to figure out
how to weigh these utility

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.620
streams in some
ways accordingly.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.010
Now, here's a broad
history of how economists

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:04.010
have thought about this.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.950
And it's interesting
to read, in fact.

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:10.400
And this is what the Frederick
et al. article talks about.

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.250
In fact, economists sort of
went full circle in some way.

00:13:13.250 --> 00:13:16.040
So it started with a
very complicated model

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:19.910
of a production, the
amount of labor allocated

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.710
to the production
of capital that

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:23.990
depends on the effective
desire of accumulation,

00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:25.700
which is a bit of a mouthful.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.230
But essentially,
there was lots of

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:30.200
rich psychological
considerations involved

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.690
in trying to explain how
people make choices over time.

00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:36.215
People thought about
self-control, self-restraint,

00:13:36.215 --> 00:13:38.090
the bequest motive, how
much they think about

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:40.460
their children,
anticipatory utility--

00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:43.610
people like to save because they
like to think they'll be happy

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:44.370
in the future--

00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:45.480
and so on, and so forth.

00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.500
And it was a very complicated
model of intertemporal choice

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:51.200
that people had
been thinking about.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.580
At some point, then
Bohm-Bawerk, who

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:55.640
was an Austrian
economist at some point

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.430
realized or proposed that the
interest rate, in some sense,

00:13:58.430 --> 00:13:59.673
is just a price.

00:13:59.673 --> 00:14:02.090
So if you think about doing
something or saving some money

00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.730
from today until next
year, it's really

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:08.208
just like choosing between
apples and bananas.

00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:10.000
When you choose between
apples and bananas,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.800
there's a relative price, which
is the price of apples divided

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.480
by the price of bananas.

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.810
If you think about
choices over time,

00:14:17.810 --> 00:14:21.920
if you think about consuming
$1 today versus $1 next year,

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.080
the interest rate or 1
plus the interest rate

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.530
is the relative price of that.

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:29.990
So for any dollar
that I now consume,

00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:32.490
I could get 1 plus r
dollars in the future.

00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:34.920
That's just the relative
price of consumption

00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:36.330
now versus in the future.

00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.580
So you could think of--

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.680
the same way we think
about apples and bananas

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.110
and optimizing between
those, the same way we

00:14:42.110 --> 00:14:46.350
can think about consumption
in the present and the future,

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.380
which are just sort of like
different goods over time.

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.550
And so Irving Fisher,
then, came up and said,

00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:56.330
let's just write down a
two-good in difference diagram.

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.420
This is exactly the
indifference diagram

00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:02.690
that you've seen in like 1401
or other introductory Micro

00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:04.310
classes.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:06.680
Still, there were actually
many psychological factors

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:10.010
discussed, like personal
factors that determine

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.140
how much you save, and so on.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.060
But it was progress
towards that.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:16.850
Now, what is the Fisher diagram?

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:18.840
The Fisher diagram looks
something like this.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.500
This is what you should
be familiar with from,

00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.300
again, 1401.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:24.210
What do we see here?

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:24.752
What is this?

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:29.590
Yes.

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:32.627
STUDENT: I guess it traces
between [INAUDIBLE]..

00:15:32.627 --> 00:15:33.960
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right, exactly.

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.660
So we have here choices between
two goods, call them good

00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:38.940
a and good b.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:42.900
There's a consumption. c a
is consumption of good a,

00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.850
c b is a consumption of good b.

00:15:44.850 --> 00:15:47.370
We have a budget
set, essentially,

00:15:47.370 --> 00:15:51.330
which is determined here by how
much your budget's constrained,

00:15:51.330 --> 00:15:56.670
which is the triangle
line that you see there.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.650
The slope of that
budget set is determined

00:15:58.650 --> 00:15:59.700
by the relative price.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:03.818
That's essentially the
p a divided by p b.

00:16:03.818 --> 00:16:06.360
And then we have what's called
an "indifference curve," which

00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.443
essentially is the curve
that makes us indifferent

00:16:08.443 --> 00:16:11.670
between combinations
of two goods.

00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:13.488
And we choose the point
on the budget line

00:16:13.488 --> 00:16:15.030
that's the furthest
out, that gets us

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:16.660
in the furthest
indifference curve.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:20.190
So that's 1401 that you
should be all familiar with.

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:21.660
In part, that's
what was discussed

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:24.185
in recitation on Friday.

00:16:24.185 --> 00:16:25.560
Now, Fisher then
pointed out when

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.280
you think about
choices over time,

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.710
in fact, that's
exactly the same thing.

00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:32.640
Think about it two periods,
period one and period two.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:34.470
We have, essentially,
a budget line, again,

00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:35.400
which is the budget set.

00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:37.317
Again, that's what was
discussed in recitation

00:16:37.317 --> 00:16:38.597
on Thursday and Friday.

00:16:38.597 --> 00:16:40.680
The difference here, of
course, is then the price.

00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.560
The relative price is determined
by the interest rates.

00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:47.850
So 1 plus r is now essentially
the relative price, or 1 over 1

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.250
plus r, that determines
essentially how much we

00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:52.410
can maximally consume.

00:16:52.410 --> 00:16:54.230
Again, the triangle
that you see here

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:56.265
is the potential set
that you consume.

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:58.140
And then again, you have
a indifference curve

00:16:58.140 --> 00:17:00.960
that tells us the
sets of points that we

00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.960
are indifferent between,
good one and good two.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:06.839
And we choose what's furthest
out on the indifference curve.

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:08.730
So essentially, we
can apply any tools

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.910
that we have from 1401
or any Micro class,

00:17:11.910 --> 00:17:14.280
from choices between
apples and bananas

00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:18.983
to choices between period
one and period two.

00:17:18.983 --> 00:17:20.400
And so what we're
sort of ignoring

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.200
here is then in period
one and period two,

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:23.700
how are we going
to spend the money?

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:27.119
So we think of c1 and c2
as consumption bundles.

00:17:27.119 --> 00:17:28.650
Think about this
like how much money

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.020
is spent on certain
consumption goods in period one

00:17:31.020 --> 00:17:34.040
versus period two, ignoring
whether you buy apples

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.530
or bananas, just how much money
do you want to spend in period

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:40.440
one, how much money do you
want to spend in period two,

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.750
ignoring how exactly are
you going to divide it,

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.958
assuming that you're going
to get this right in terms

00:17:44.958 --> 00:17:48.700
of choosing within the
period what's best for you.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:49.710
Any questions on that?

00:17:56.590 --> 00:18:00.160
OK, so that gets us
to the workhorse model

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.480
in economics, which is
Samuelson's discounted utility

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:02.980
model.

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.090
Paul Samuelson is a very
famous economist who

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:07.720
was at MIT for many,
many years, one

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:11.410
of the founders, if you
want, of modern economics,

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:16.450
and the MIT Economics
Department as it is right now.

00:18:16.450 --> 00:18:19.405
And what Samuelson proposed
was a non-graphical version

00:18:19.405 --> 00:18:21.530
of that, where he said,
let's write down some math.

00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:23.320
Let's write down
the representation.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.490
How should we think about
utility maximization?

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.580
And what essentially he was
proposing is to say at time t,

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:34.130
people maximize their discounted
utility, which is just

00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:37.900
the sum of discounted utility
where there is a factor

00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:40.570
delta, which
determines how much we

00:18:40.570 --> 00:18:43.150
care about the present
versus the future.

00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:46.550
So we have, essentially, these
instantaneous utilities, u t,

00:18:46.550 --> 00:18:48.760
u t plus 1, u t
plus 2, and so on.

00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.220
This is your utility
at each point in time.

00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.750
Think of time as being discrete.

00:18:52.750 --> 00:18:55.150
In a sense, time
could be years, time

00:18:55.150 --> 00:18:56.500
could be days, and the like.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.300
Think of them perhaps
as years for now.

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.450
There's your t, your t
plus 1, your t plus 2,

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.610
your t plus three, and so on.

00:19:03.610 --> 00:19:07.750
u t summarizes, in some sense,
how you feel in that year

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:09.460
overall in terms of utility.

00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:12.760
That's your utility in
that particular period.

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:13.740
It could also be daily.

00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:15.490
It could be how you
feel on a certain day,

00:19:15.490 --> 00:19:18.340
could be hourly, and so on.

00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:21.460
That's just a matter
of definition.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:28.585
And again, u t is a function of
all activities that are going

00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:29.710
on in that particular year.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:32.043
That could be consumption,
leisure, all the other things

00:19:32.043 --> 00:19:32.830
that are going on.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:34.247
That's sort of
like in some sense,

00:19:34.247 --> 00:19:37.000
we abstract away what happens
within that particular time

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:37.700
period.

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:39.700
We're just summarizing
all the things

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.610
you're doing in that year
yield to a certain utility.

00:19:42.610 --> 00:19:46.220
And now the question is, how do
we aggregate these utilities?

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.130
How do we decide between
different options

00:19:48.130 --> 00:19:52.635
when the u t's differ
across different options?

00:19:52.635 --> 00:19:54.010
Now, what's coming
in here, then,

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.940
is the discount factor
delta, which you see above,

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:02.200
which essentially is
telling you how much is util

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.400
or an amount of utility,
a unit of utility,

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.430
worth in the future
compared to the present.

00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:13.720
And so what you see here is
a very simple functional form

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.010
of doing that.

00:20:15.010 --> 00:20:17.410
Everything that's in the
future is discounted.

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:20.560
Usually, we think of delta
being smaller than 1.

00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.930
So delta could be something
like 0.9, 0.8, or the like.

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:32.182
So if you're in period t, period
t plus 1 is discounted by 0.9.

00:20:32.182 --> 00:20:33.640
Period two would
be then discounted

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.360
by 0.9 to the power of 2,
and so on, and so forth.

00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:39.690
And so delta is essentially
a very simple way

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:42.790
of replacing a very
complex psychology, how

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.610
we think about
choices over time,

00:20:45.610 --> 00:20:49.750
by saying let's just assume
that people over time

00:20:49.750 --> 00:20:52.330
have a constant way of
discounting the future.

00:20:52.330 --> 00:20:56.680
And it's taken on a
simple mathematical form

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.170
of exponentially doing so.

00:21:00.170 --> 00:21:03.640
Any questions on that?

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.890
Yes.

00:21:05.890 --> 00:21:10.520
STUDENT: Why was Samuelson's
model adopted so widely?

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.680
I mean, so it said
in the reading

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:20.085
that it was very simple and very
pretty, but he's very much--

00:21:20.085 --> 00:21:24.540
it seemed like oversimplified
a lot of the research that

00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:26.520
had been done in the past.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.500
Why were people
so quick, I guess?

00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.401
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

00:21:30.401 --> 00:21:31.818
STUDENT: Was it,
like, the fashion

00:21:31.818 --> 00:21:33.170
to have these [INAUDIBLE]?

00:21:33.170 --> 00:21:34.930
FRANK SCHILBACH:
Yeah, so I think

00:21:34.930 --> 00:21:37.480
one has to think a little bit
about where things are coming

00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:39.970
from, in the sense
that to start with,

00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.770
nobody had formalized
some of these choices

00:21:41.770 --> 00:21:42.670
that people were making.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:44.270
In some sense,
Samuelson was, like, OK,

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:45.460
we have to assume something.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:47.650
So let's assume
exponential discounting.

00:21:47.650 --> 00:21:49.040
That's a simple thing to do.

00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:52.090
So let me just make that
assumption as a first pass.

00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.400
He actually never thought
this is the right model,

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:57.100
or this is a normative model
how people should behave,

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:57.910
or the like.

00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.048
That was all coming later.

00:21:59.048 --> 00:22:01.090
He was just proposing
something that's tractable.

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:04.695
And for tractability,
he was proposing that.

00:22:04.695 --> 00:22:06.070
Now, it's important
to understand

00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:07.487
for a lot of
behavioral economics,

00:22:07.487 --> 00:22:11.050
a lot of neoclassical economics,
the traditional economics,

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:12.220
simplicity is good.

00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:16.510
So usually, we like to
simplify a lot of choices.

00:22:16.510 --> 00:22:20.500
And when things are simple,
you can, in a tractable way,

00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.790
analyze things in the world.

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:23.500
And for many problems
in the world,

00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.090
like for example,
economic growth,

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.590
or like how the economy
evolves as a whole,

00:22:27.590 --> 00:22:30.722
and so on, some of these, the
exponential discounting model

00:22:30.722 --> 00:22:32.680
might actually be the
right model in some ways.

00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.920
Or if you think about
how managers of firms,

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.973
or whatever, et cetera,
behave, in some ways

00:22:37.973 --> 00:22:39.640
that might be the
right-- or the economy

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.920
as a whole-- that might be
the right model overall.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:44.920
So in some sense, the
answer is kind of like, A,

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.770
some choices are actually
explained reasonably well

00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:49.360
with exponential discounting.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:53.860
B, it was simple and easy to do,
and you had to start somewhere.

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:58.203
And then C, I guess people tend
to stick to traditional things.

00:22:58.203 --> 00:23:00.370
So in some ways, once you
have written down a model,

00:23:00.370 --> 00:23:03.460
and people have written papers
and invested their career

00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.460
in it, they tend to defend that,
where in fact, maybe that's not

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:09.970
the right thing to do, and
become dogmatic about it.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:12.250
But that's now changing.

00:23:12.250 --> 00:23:14.770
And exactly as you say, there's
problems with this model,

00:23:14.770 --> 00:23:19.240
and we're going to talk
about those right now.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.280
Now let me tell you a little
bit about some definitions,

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:26.423
just to be clear what
we're talking about.

00:23:26.423 --> 00:23:28.090
So one is, what's a
"discount function,"

00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:31.430
what's a "discount rate," and
what's a "discount factor?"

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.680
So these are just definitions.

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.350
A discount function
essentially is

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:38.530
when you have a stream of future
utilities, u t, u t plus 1,

00:23:38.530 --> 00:23:40.720
u t plus 2, and so
on, and so forth, you

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:42.340
have to write down
a function how

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:43.970
to weigh these in the future.

00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:46.600
So d of tau, as I'm
calling it, is essentially

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.100
giving you this
discount function

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.170
that specifies essentially
all the weights

00:23:50.170 --> 00:23:56.080
that you're putting on future
utilities and future periods.

00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:57.580
That could be that
functional form.

00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:58.330
Could be anything.

00:23:58.330 --> 00:24:01.150
That's just a very
general definition.

00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:03.400
Now, what's the discount rate?

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.900
It's essentially
the rate of decline

00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:05.980
of the discount function.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.470
We call that rho and rho
of tau, which essentially

00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:10.660
is just the derivative
with respect to time

00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:16.070
divided by the discount
function at that point in time.

00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:19.810
And the negative of that,
because we think usually as

00:24:19.810 --> 00:24:24.640
positive as in the discount
function tends to decline,

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.100
as in stuff that's
further away in the future

00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.940
you put less weight on than
stuff that's closer to you

00:24:30.940 --> 00:24:32.990
or closer to the present.

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:35.170
And so again, rho
of tau specifies

00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:39.880
the rate at which value a
util declines with delay.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:42.640
And then finally, what does
exponential discounting do?

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:47.080
Exponential discounting
specifies a specific functional

00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:49.750
form of the discount function.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:50.600
What does that mean?

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:53.017
Essentially, we just take the
discount function, d of tau,

00:24:53.017 --> 00:24:55.150
and what Samuelson was
doing then was essentially

00:24:55.150 --> 00:24:57.710
just proposing a specific
functional form, saying,

00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:58.870
OK, let's try that one.

00:24:58.870 --> 00:25:00.985
That's a simple thing to do.

00:25:00.985 --> 00:25:02.110
Why do you choose that one?

00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:06.310
Well, it's delta to
the power of tau.

00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:07.990
The discount factor
now is delta.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:10.563
This is essentially when
you think about two periods,

00:25:10.563 --> 00:25:12.730
how much weight do you put
on each of those periods.

00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:14.350
Let me just go
back for a second.

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:17.800
Here, when you think about
going from u t to u t plus 1,

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.180
you just add an
additional delta.

00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:22.750
And going from u t plus 1 to u
t plus 2, you add another delta,

00:25:22.750 --> 00:25:23.342
and so on.

00:25:23.342 --> 00:25:25.300
That gives you essentially
the relative weights

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.820
between two adjacent periods.

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:30.670
Now crucially, as you see
here in that functional form,

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:31.692
this is constant.

00:25:31.692 --> 00:25:34.150
So every time you have a time
period, you go to the future,

00:25:34.150 --> 00:25:35.470
you add another delta.

00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:36.860
And that's an assumption.

00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:38.530
So that's a very
convenient thing to do.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.300
In part what it tells
you, then, is also

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.820
that the discount rate
is constant over time.

00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:44.500
Again, so that you
could do some math,

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.870
and calculate the discount
rate, if you do that,

00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:49.690
you'll find out
that the discount

00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:56.800
rate is minus log delta, which
is approximately 1 minus delta.

00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.740
That is to say, not only is
the discount factor constant,

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.050
but also the discount
rate is constant.

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:05.470
And that's an assumption,
again, that's made by Samuelson.

00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:06.530
So you can do that math.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.980
We can also do some of
that in recitation in case

00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:10.210
you have questions.

00:26:10.210 --> 00:26:12.165
Now let me give you
an example on how

00:26:12.165 --> 00:26:13.540
does that help us
think about how

00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.630
people make choices over time.

00:26:16.630 --> 00:26:19.700
Student Amy considers
writing a term paper today

00:26:19.700 --> 00:26:24.440
so as to give herself a
free evening in the future.

00:26:24.440 --> 00:26:28.660
So this is essentially the idea
that the student now, tonight,

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:30.160
has some stuff to do.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.500
There's some opportunity
costs right now.

00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:34.360
An outside option--
she could watch TV,

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.190
she could meet her
friends, or whatever,

00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.550
or she could write
her a paper right now.

00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:41.530
The paper, if you write
the paper right now,

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.020
it comes at a utility
cost of minus 1,

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.345
costs 1 util because
the other activities

00:26:46.345 --> 00:26:47.470
would be more fun to do it.

00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:49.300
She'd rather watch movies.

00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:52.780
However, if, instead, she
also has some other stuff

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:54.820
to do tonight, so
she doesn't really

00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:57.310
have a free evening if she
doesn't write the paper,

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:00.070
but she just prefers not
to write it right now.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.530
Now, if she writes
the paper right now,

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.210
she will get a free
evening sometime

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.490
in the future in a
few days from now.

00:27:06.490 --> 00:27:07.972
And that would be
a lot more fun.

00:27:07.972 --> 00:27:08.680
She could go out.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.360
She could do whatever other
things she likes to do.

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.180
She could go to the symphony
or whatever she likes doing.

00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:16.410
The instantaneous benefit, the
utility of getting a free unit,

00:27:16.410 --> 00:27:19.810
is 4/3 utils, so it's higher
than the cost right now.

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.810
But it's in the future,
in some future evening.

00:27:22.810 --> 00:27:28.060
Suppose Amy's daily
discount factor is 0.9.

00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:29.498
Now, what does she do?

00:27:29.498 --> 00:27:30.790
How do we think about this now?

00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:37.135
So the daily discount
factor is 0.9.

00:27:37.135 --> 00:27:39.385
Is she going to do it if the
free evening is tomorrow?

00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:46.005
Yes.

00:27:46.005 --> 00:27:46.963
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:57.281
FRANK SCHILBACH: And that's
positive or negative?

00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.090
It's positive.

00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:02.590
Exactly.

00:28:02.590 --> 00:28:03.350
But it's exactly right.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:05.980
So you have to think about she
gets the immediate costs right

00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.550
now, which is minus 1, the
benefits of 4/3 on the future.

00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:11.830
Since her daily
discount factor is 0.9,

00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:14.170
she's going to
discount that by 0.9.

00:28:14.170 --> 00:28:15.550
That's still larger than 1.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.350
So she decides to do that.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.540
That's how she
weighs, essentially,

00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:21.160
the present and the future.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.650
Now, in two periods, she
does the exact same thing.

00:28:23.650 --> 00:28:26.480
But two periods are now
further away in the future.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:30.010
So she discounts it by
delta to the power of 2.

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:32.320
And that gives her,
again, something

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.020
that's larger than 0,
if I got the math right.

00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.640
So still she's willing to
do it, if the free night

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.800
comes two nights from now.

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.180
If it's in three periods,
however, turns out

00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.310
then minus 1 plus delta to
the power of 3 times 4/3

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:51.700
is, in fact, smaller than 0.

00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.240
So she will not do it.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.870
So essentially, when she thinks
about costs and benefits,

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:58.955
it depends a lot on how far away
are the benefits in the future.

00:28:58.955 --> 00:29:01.330
The further they're away in
the future, the more they get

00:29:01.330 --> 00:29:02.872
discounted, and the
less likely she's

00:29:02.872 --> 00:29:05.890
doing something that will
cost her utility now and yield

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.210
benefits in the future.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.570
Now, of course that's
highly stylized.

00:29:10.570 --> 00:29:12.301
Yeah.

00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:16.028
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:29:16.028 --> 00:29:17.070
FRANK SCHILBACH: Correct.

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.500
Correct.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:18.880
So what I'm assuming
here, I was not

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.713
saying, when is the
best time of doing that.

00:29:20.713 --> 00:29:23.170
What I was assuming is
choice between today

00:29:23.170 --> 00:29:24.550
versus in a few days from now.

00:29:24.550 --> 00:29:26.290
There was no option of
saying today, actually,

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:27.400
I'd rather do it tomorrow.

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:29.230
We'll get to that.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:32.920
I was just giving you an
example of a very simple choice

00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:36.160
between today versus sometime
in the future, and then

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.943
another choice between
today versus tomorrow, today

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:40.360
versus in two days
from now, today

00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:43.210
versus three days from now,
assuming that other days are

00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:45.160
not an option for now.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.990
We'll get to-- so
procrastination,

00:29:46.990 --> 00:29:48.680
you need several days.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:51.607
We'll get to that later.

00:29:51.607 --> 00:29:53.940
So again, the bottom line--
one second-- the bottom line

00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:56.398
is she will do it if the nice
evening comes the next period

00:29:56.398 --> 00:29:58.930
or in two periods, but
not if it comes later.

00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.715
Yeah.

00:29:59.715 --> 00:30:01.990
STUDENT: Doesn't
in all the periods

00:30:01.990 --> 00:30:06.144
she gets more utility if she
rather gets a free day today

00:30:06.144 --> 00:30:12.010
and she switches the options,
so she can [INAUDIBLE]??

00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:13.100
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:15.550
Yeah, so what I'm assuming
here-- and this is, again,

00:30:15.550 --> 00:30:17.730
an assumption-- is that
the free night cannot--

00:30:17.730 --> 00:30:21.220
so I was saying a little bit,
but perhaps not clearly--

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:22.937
she has something to
do tonight anyway,

00:30:22.937 --> 00:30:24.520
so she can't really
have a free night.

00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:27.540
Maybe she needs to call
her friends and so on.

00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.290
So that option is not
available right now.

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:30.200
You're exactly right.

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.658
If the free night came tonight,
she would do that, and then

00:30:32.658 --> 00:30:35.650
do the stuff later,
because she prefers

00:30:35.650 --> 00:30:37.480
the present over the future.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:40.070
But I was assuming that
away for simplicity.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:43.360
But in general, as it
happens, many choices

00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:47.260
are often in the form
of either current costs

00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:49.870
and future benefits,
and then you'd

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:53.860
rather defer those things.

00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:56.110
You only do that,
essentially, if the benefits

00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.790
are sufficiently high.

00:30:57.790 --> 00:31:01.120
Other options are current
benefits and future costs,

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:04.900
and then the entire thing
is essentially flipped.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.150
So now, the next
question, then, you

00:31:07.150 --> 00:31:11.140
might have is to say, well, how
do we actually estimate delta?

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:15.730
So we see people doing
choices, but in some sense

00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.230
in the real world,
we actually don't

00:31:17.230 --> 00:31:18.880
know what somebody's delta is.

00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:22.030
So how can we actually estimate
people's delta over all?

00:31:22.030 --> 00:31:24.220
Let's stick with the
stylized example.

00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:27.640
What do we need to estimate
delta in this specific example?

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.130
Well, you would need
several choices over time,

00:31:30.130 --> 00:31:32.230
and then essentially,
you need to know

00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:34.780
what the costs and benefits
of those choices are.

00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.300
And if you knew
that, then you could

00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.180
learn about what delta is.

00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.200
Let me just write
this down for you.

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.810
Suppose we didn't
know Amy's delta,

00:31:43.810 --> 00:31:47.380
but we knew that u
tau's for all periods

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:49.230
for the different
options that she has.

00:31:49.230 --> 00:31:51.760
So how could we estimate
this from the above data?

00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.590
So we learned,
essentially, over here,

00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:56.230
suppose we see this
behavior overall.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:59.890
What we get is several
inequalities involving delta

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:04.210
and involving u t's or u
tau's that people choose

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:05.980
in different points in time.

00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:08.170
So once we have
these inequalities,

00:32:08.170 --> 00:32:11.650
then we can essentially
just estimate what is delta.

00:32:11.650 --> 00:32:14.812
We just back out what delta
is from these choices.

00:32:14.812 --> 00:32:15.520
So what do we do?

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:17.770
Well, we can just
essentially do the math.

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:18.790
It's very simple.

00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.460
And what we'll find
is, for example, if you

00:32:21.460 --> 00:32:24.650
see that the behavior
that we just saw,

00:32:24.650 --> 00:32:27.760
which was essentially
that she does it

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.920
when the free night
comes one day from now

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.610
or two days from now, that
gives us two inequalities,

00:32:33.610 --> 00:32:36.640
the first two inequalities
that are written down,

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:40.180
which is essentially delta
must be larger than 3/4,

00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:43.630
delta must be larger than
3/4 to the power of 1/2,

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:45.730
which is about 0.87.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:48.888
And then we have a third
choice, where she doesn't do it

00:32:48.888 --> 00:32:51.430
if the free night comes three
nights from now, which gives us

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.140
another inequality,
which tells us

00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:57.100
delta must be lower than 0.91.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.140
So if you saw those
choices, but if you

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:02.110
knew the utility of a
person, you could then

00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:03.250
back out what delta is.

00:33:03.250 --> 00:33:08.780
And delta in this case would
be between 0.87 and 0.91.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:12.780
Does this make sense or
any questions about that?

00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:14.722
So all I was doing
here is to say,

00:33:14.722 --> 00:33:16.430
suppose we didn't know
delta, but we just

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:18.440
saw the Amy's choices.

00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.000
What can we learn
about her delta

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.420
if we knew what the utilities
are at each point in time?

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.597
And if you do that,
from this behavior

00:33:26.597 --> 00:33:27.680
we get these inequalities.

00:33:27.680 --> 00:33:30.830
And we can then back
out what the delta is.

00:33:30.830 --> 00:33:32.330
Now in reality,
we actually don't

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:34.030
know what the u tau's are.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:36.440
We don't know what utility
is for different options

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.020
from people.

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:39.103
So if you see people's
behavior, we can't actually

00:33:39.103 --> 00:33:42.020
estimate the delta from that.

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.330
So what could we do instead,
or what kinds of choices

00:33:44.330 --> 00:33:46.830
can we make or can we elicit?

00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:54.680
Yes.

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.222
STUDENT: If you can
do it with money,

00:33:56.222 --> 00:33:57.741
there are different options.

00:33:57.741 --> 00:33:59.582
You have a chance
to win [INAUDIBLE]..

00:33:59.582 --> 00:34:00.540
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.230
And what additional assumptions
do we need for that?

00:34:03.230 --> 00:34:04.230
So that's exactly right.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:07.770
That's exactly what
people have done a lot.

00:34:07.770 --> 00:34:10.980
So this is Rick Thaler
again, a Nobel Prize winner

00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:15.330
who has done exactly
that in 1981,

00:34:15.330 --> 00:34:18.449
getting people to start with
hypothetical monetary choices.

00:34:18.449 --> 00:34:21.162
So say suppose--
this is kind of what

00:34:21.162 --> 00:34:23.370
I was asking you at the
beginning in the first class.

00:34:23.370 --> 00:34:25.530
I was asking you
different numbers,

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:29.250
but what x makes you
indifferent between $15 today

00:34:29.250 --> 00:34:34.679
and x dollars in a month, a
year, and 10 years from now?

00:34:34.679 --> 00:34:36.510
What do we need to
assume for that now?

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:40.239
Or what other
assumptions do we need?

00:34:40.239 --> 00:34:43.917
How do we go from
money to your utility?

00:34:43.917 --> 00:34:47.718
STUDENT: There's an
old study [INAUDIBLE]..

00:34:47.718 --> 00:34:48.760
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:51.179
I need to assume something
that's quite important.

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:54.820
I need to assume utility
is linear in money,

00:34:54.820 --> 00:34:58.060
either to say I'm just looking
at that specific problem,

00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:02.403
u of X equals X. Or
slightly more complicated,

00:35:02.403 --> 00:35:04.195
but in principle the
same, marginal utility

00:35:04.195 --> 00:35:06.520
is constant over time.

00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.923
And that's sort of related.

00:35:08.923 --> 00:35:10.340
For our purposes,
what we're going

00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:13.550
to assume for now is
just to say your utility

00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:14.590
is linear in money.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:16.720
You have X equals X.

00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:22.420
And then what you can do is
if I give you an amount Y--

00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.300
Y is $15-- and
then I ask you what

00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:27.310
makes you indifferent
between X dollars in, say,

00:35:27.310 --> 00:35:29.710
a month or a year from now?

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:32.200
I'm just going to write down
an equation, which essentially

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.770
is to say u of Y, which
is the utility of getting

00:35:35.770 --> 00:35:37.390
the $15 right now--

00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:40.390
is you're indifferent between
that because you just told me

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:44.350
so, and u of X, which X is the
amount that you just told me.

00:35:44.350 --> 00:35:46.270
And now I need to
discount that by delta

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:50.020
to the power of t, which is
because it's in the future,

00:35:50.020 --> 00:35:52.120
you need to discount that.

00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.100
Once I know that, I know
essentially everything

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.642
on the left-hand side and the
right-hand side of the equation

00:35:56.642 --> 00:35:57.620
except for the delta.

00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:00.882
I can just back out
delta from that.

00:36:00.882 --> 00:36:03.340
So what we're going to do is
we're going to just use, then,

00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:07.270
the linearity assumption
of the utility

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:10.690
is linear in money, which
is like u of Y equals Y,

00:36:10.690 --> 00:36:12.670
and u of X equals X.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:14.710
We take logs on both
sides and rearrange,

00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:19.600
and then get rho, which is,
again, the discount rate,

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.370
equals minus log delta.

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:24.730
And that's log of X
divided by Y and divided

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:28.960
by t, which is the time period
that I'm asking you about.

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:32.830
That's a simple algebra
and rearranging things.

00:36:32.830 --> 00:36:35.020
We talked about a
little bit in recitation

00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:37.017
and in the problem set as well.

00:36:37.017 --> 00:36:38.600
But is it clear what
we're doing here?

00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.058
Are there any
questions about that?

00:36:46.312 --> 00:36:48.020
So just to summarize
what I'm doing here,

00:36:48.020 --> 00:36:51.520
I'm just asking you between
different choices over time.

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.710
I'm assuming a utility
function of money.

00:36:53.710 --> 00:36:55.550
So I'm imposing on
you in some way--

00:36:55.550 --> 00:36:57.383
and it might be a good
or a bad assumption--

00:36:57.383 --> 00:36:59.410
but I'm essentially
assuming how you value money

00:36:59.410 --> 00:37:00.880
at different points in time.

00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:02.470
And with that
assumption, then, I

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.900
can back out from
your choices over time

00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:08.830
how much you discounting
utility in the future.

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:12.770
And then the rest is just
rearranging and doing

00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:13.270
some math.

00:37:17.850 --> 00:37:20.380
So now, how do you do that?

00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:22.830
Here's an example of how to
do that, then, for Y equals 15

00:37:22.830 --> 00:37:24.190
and X equals 20.

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:25.920
So if you told me
that what makes

00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.670
you indifferent between
$15 now and X in a month,

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:33.150
if you told me $20, I can
just write down the equation,

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:36.690
and I get essentially
a delta of 0.003.

00:37:36.690 --> 00:37:39.240
The reason being that
if you are indifferent

00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:44.903
between $15 and $20
right now, you're

00:37:44.903 --> 00:37:46.320
discounting,
essentially, anything

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:48.600
that's in the future by 3/4.

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:54.390
Essentially $20 in a month
from now or 3/4 as much--

00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:56.868
or the money in the future
is 3/4 as much worth for you

00:37:56.868 --> 00:37:57.910
than the money right now.

00:37:57.910 --> 00:38:00.325
That's the 20 versus
15 in a month from now.

00:38:00.325 --> 00:38:01.950
And then I have to
do this every month.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:04.500
So every month, it's
3/4 to the power of 12

00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:10.350
will give you something
like 0.03 as delta.

00:38:10.350 --> 00:38:16.080
So I'm just calculating
the yearly discount factor

00:38:16.080 --> 00:38:17.680
using your monthly choice.

00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.471
Yeah.

00:38:18.471 --> 00:38:21.202
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:21.202 --> 00:38:22.160
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:25.680
So usually, what people do
is yearly discount factors.

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.380
So usually the delta is yearly.

00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:28.640
That's just a convention.

00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:31.530
You could also do it monthly,
or daily, or whatever.

00:38:31.530 --> 00:38:33.710
So what I'm doing is
yearly discount factors,

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:40.350
partially because I want to make
them comparable across choices.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:41.870
But you could
similarly also just do

00:38:41.870 --> 00:38:43.220
the monthly one, or whatever.

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:48.110
And a lot of economic analyses,
yearly is the frequency.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:50.060
When it comes to your
problem set questions,

00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.030
it's going to be
daily, because students

00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:56.778
tend to think in days,
not necessarily in years.

00:38:56.778 --> 00:38:58.215
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE].

00:39:03.490 --> 00:39:04.780
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:07.690
So in some sense, this is
what we're getting here

00:39:07.690 --> 00:39:09.160
in some ways in saying--

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.140
here I'm asking you about--

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:14.030
so you see the choice here, and
these are actually real choices

00:39:14.030 --> 00:39:15.160
that people have made.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:20.980
When I ask you now between
Y dollars, $15, right now

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:22.870
and X dollars in
10 years from now,

00:39:22.870 --> 00:39:24.890
people tend to give
different answers.

00:39:24.890 --> 00:39:27.010
And one constant
finding there is

00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:28.810
that people tend to
be more patient when

00:39:28.810 --> 00:39:31.780
it comes to longer run choices
compared to shorter run

00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.040
choices.

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.240
I'm calculating the
same discount factor.

00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:37.870
And what I just told you
earlier is in the exponential

00:39:37.870 --> 00:39:40.540
discounting model, the
discount factor delta

00:39:40.540 --> 00:39:42.700
should be constant over time.

00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:45.340
Should be the same
whether you decide

00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:49.090
between today and tomorrow,
between a year from now

00:39:49.090 --> 00:39:51.580
and a year and a day from
now, or between any time

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:52.540
in the future.

00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:55.250
But what we find or tend to
find in these kinds of choices

00:39:55.250 --> 00:39:57.400
is that people's
discount factor is

00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.820
a lot higher in the future
compared to in the present.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:01.900
I'll get back to that.

00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.840
So actually, your question
is exactly on point.

00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.320
When eliciting choices between
different days versus months

00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:12.130
versus years, you get
a lot different answers

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.300
depending on what you ask.

00:40:15.810 --> 00:40:16.410
OK.

00:40:16.410 --> 00:40:19.940
So now, we can say-- and this
is exactly what you're asking--

00:40:19.940 --> 00:40:20.900
let's see.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.750
When you do this in different
settings, what kinds of answers

00:40:23.750 --> 00:40:24.950
do you actually get.

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:28.070
And what you see here is here's
people's choices of delta

00:40:28.070 --> 00:40:31.340
and different types of
experiments people have done.

00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.047
This is different
years of publication.

00:40:33.047 --> 00:40:34.880
But overall, what do
you see is essentially,

00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:37.040
these estimates are
all over the place.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.720
So you think we
know what delta is.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:42.150
We think it's 0.9, or
0.8, or 0.95, or whatever.

00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:44.330
But in fact, when you
look at people's choices

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:46.010
in different types
of experiments,

00:40:46.010 --> 00:40:48.480
these choices tend to
be all over the place.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.090
So that's not a good
sign for a model,

00:40:50.090 --> 00:40:54.650
because you're trying to
identify a parameter that

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:55.890
fits many settings.

00:40:55.890 --> 00:40:59.300
Well, here, it seems to be that
these choices are essentially

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:02.270
all over the place, which tells
you already maybe something is

00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:05.780
wrong in this model that
we should try to fix.

00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:09.320
Now, one thing I
already said here

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.690
is to say, when you
look at short-run

00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:14.720
versus long-run choices, we tend
to find that people are really

00:41:14.720 --> 00:41:16.280
impatient in the short run.

00:41:16.280 --> 00:41:18.440
However, people are
patient in the long run.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.760
There's lots to learn from this
experiment in various ways,

00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:29.388
in part about strategies to
overcome self-control problems.

00:41:29.388 --> 00:41:30.930
For example, a lot
of kids are trying

00:41:30.930 --> 00:41:32.700
to manage their
attention, are looking at,

00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.470
and looking away, and so on.

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:36.060
But mostly, I think
the key part you

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.940
learn is how painful
it can be to resist.

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:42.690
In the short run, there's
lots of essentially

00:41:42.690 --> 00:41:44.520
short-run discounting
or essentially

00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.560
short-run impatience
that we see in the world.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.230
And if you think about it, often
it's very hard in the short run

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:49.982
to resist.

00:41:49.982 --> 00:41:51.690
Often when you think
about in the future,

00:41:51.690 --> 00:41:53.628
it's much easier to do so.

00:41:53.628 --> 00:41:55.170
When you think about
choices that you

00:41:55.170 --> 00:41:57.360
might face in your life--

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.190
be it marshmallows
or something else--

00:41:59.190 --> 00:42:01.620
would you rather have one
marshmallow right now versus

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.708
two marshmallows in an
hour, you might say,

00:42:03.708 --> 00:42:06.000
well, maybe one marshmallow
looks actually pretty good.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.220
Let's just take that one
marshmallow right now.

00:42:08.220 --> 00:42:12.710
And a lot of these kids, I
guess, opted for doing so.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:14.550
When I ask you
instead, would you

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.680
like to have a marshmallow
in a week from now

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:19.260
versus two marshmallows in
a week from now and an hour,

00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:20.520
it almost becomes ridiculous.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:22.478
Of course you're going
to take two marshmallows

00:42:22.478 --> 00:42:24.870
in a week and an hour from now.

00:42:24.870 --> 00:42:27.000
What does it matter in
terms of when exactly you

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.140
get the marshmallow?

00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.290
When I ask you the same
questions about one marshmallow

00:42:31.290 --> 00:42:34.290
in a year from now versus
two marshmallows in a year

00:42:34.290 --> 00:42:37.357
and an hour from now, it becomes
very obvious that of course, I

00:42:37.357 --> 00:42:38.940
want the two
marshmallows-- unless you

00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:43.480
think in a year from now,
you might be on a diet.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:45.720
But the exponential
discounting model

00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:47.190
has precisely that assumption.

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:49.890
The assumption is that
how much you discount

00:42:49.890 --> 00:42:52.765
an hour in this case
does not vary depending

00:42:52.765 --> 00:42:54.390
on whether it's right
now, whether it's

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.015
in a week from now,
versus whether it's

00:42:56.015 --> 00:42:57.310
in a year from now.

00:42:57.310 --> 00:43:00.090
And the short-run
discounting essentially

00:43:00.090 --> 00:43:01.920
tends to violate
that assumption,

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.560
in part because it leads to
pretty absurd implications,

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.942
as I'm going to
show you in a bit.

00:43:06.942 --> 00:43:08.400
So what other
evidence in the world

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:11.960
do we have about
short-run impatience,

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.523
other than the marshmallows?

00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:18.450
Yes.

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:23.182
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
get concentrated.

00:43:23.182 --> 00:43:24.140
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.150
There's lots of-- I
think among you guys,

00:43:26.150 --> 00:43:30.470
not that many people smoke,
but lots of smokers would say,

00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.440
oh, I'd love to stop
smoking in the future.

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:35.570
I really want to quit.

00:43:35.570 --> 00:43:39.433
But then they find it
very hard to do right now.

00:43:39.433 --> 00:43:40.850
And maybe next
time in the future,

00:43:40.850 --> 00:43:42.440
I will quit, and so
on, and so forth.

00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:44.630
Lots of people try, and
then fail, and so on.

00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:48.320
And in part, it's like
the short-run impatience

00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:50.812
or short-run
difficulty to do that

00:43:50.812 --> 00:43:53.270
compared to maybe the long-run
desires of wanting to do so.

00:43:53.270 --> 00:43:54.770
We'll get back to
smoking, actually,

00:43:54.770 --> 00:43:56.480
at some point in the future.

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:58.820
But that's exactly a
great example of that.

00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.400
That's also true for other
drugs, other addictions,

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.850
and so on.

00:44:02.850 --> 00:44:04.910
Actually, some of
the social media,

00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:06.860
or computers, or
phones, or whatever,

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:08.650
you can also think of
like that being sort

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:09.650
of addictive in a sense.

00:44:09.650 --> 00:44:12.120
In the short run, it's very
hard to get away from that.

00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.550
But in the very long run, it
would be nice thing to do.

00:44:14.550 --> 00:44:18.410
Often, then, there's
short-run impatience involved.

00:44:18.410 --> 00:44:20.192
Yeah.

00:44:20.192 --> 00:44:23.507
STUDENT: Taking a break
now versus [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:23.507 --> 00:44:25.340
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah,
so a break now always

00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:26.690
seems like a great idea.

00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:28.310
And then in the
future, you're going

00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:30.020
to work really hard and so on.

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.300
And then the future
comes, and again,

00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:36.390
taking a break right now
seems really appealing.

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:37.100
Yeah.

00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.267
STUDENT: Aggressive driving.

00:44:38.267 --> 00:44:39.933
FRANK SCHILBACH: Oh,
that's interesting.

00:44:39.933 --> 00:44:41.187
Can you say more?

00:44:41.187 --> 00:44:43.020
STUDENT: In the short
run, you're impatient.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:45.320
You're concerned
about your [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:47.828
so you might try to get
to the destination faster.

00:44:47.828 --> 00:44:50.286
Or just in general, people try
to get to the destination as

00:44:50.286 --> 00:44:52.732
fast as possible [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:52.732 --> 00:44:53.690
FRANK SCHILBACH: Right.

00:44:53.690 --> 00:44:56.070
So of course, there's also
other factors involved,

00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.350
including risk and the like.

00:44:57.350 --> 00:45:00.110
You might think-- you
underestimate how risky it is,

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.480
and you might think, oh,
I might be overconfident,

00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:04.770
that you're never going
to have an accident.

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.982
But exactly as you say, in
the short run, essentially

00:45:06.982 --> 00:45:08.690
there's some short-run
benefits, which is

00:45:08.690 --> 00:45:10.280
like I could be there faster.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:13.670
It's kind of annoying to
drive, and so on, and so forth.

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:16.550
The costs are in the future
in some sense, so uncertain.

00:45:16.550 --> 00:45:20.090
You might crash
and so on, and you

00:45:20.090 --> 00:45:21.920
might be impatient in
the very short run.

00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:22.462
That's right.

00:45:22.462 --> 00:45:24.673
But I think that's a
little tricky as an example

00:45:24.673 --> 00:45:26.340
because there's all
these other factors.

00:45:26.340 --> 00:45:28.910
I do think, however, that
short-run impatience is

00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:31.610
involved in that as well.

00:45:31.610 --> 00:45:32.300
Yes.

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.550
STUDENT: I think credit cards
are also a good example.

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:37.370
Like, you can buy this now
with a credit card instead

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:39.515
of saving to buy the thing.

00:45:39.515 --> 00:45:40.390
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes.

00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:43.640
So a lot of essentially
choices of money over time,

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:47.020
you can see the choices that I
was asking you guys in class.

00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:51.430
That essentially shows some
short-run impatience as well.

00:45:51.430 --> 00:45:56.050
There's perhaps even
more salient payday loans

00:45:56.050 --> 00:45:57.680
that you might be familiar with.

00:45:57.680 --> 00:46:01.570
So payday loans are essentially
a very interesting phenomenon,

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:03.070
where essentially,
there are workers

00:46:03.070 --> 00:46:06.070
who get their paycheck
by the end of the month

00:46:06.070 --> 00:46:07.720
or the beginning of
the month, but then

00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:10.390
on the 20th of the month
or sometime earlier, they

00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:12.803
would like to have some
money earlier than that.

00:46:12.803 --> 00:46:14.470
So you can essentially
just say, give me

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.600
some money at a very
high interest rate,

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:20.470
and once my payday comes,
I'm going to pay you back.

00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:22.570
The interest rates
are usually enormous.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:25.750
Usually it's something like up
to 5,000 annualized compound

00:46:25.750 --> 00:46:27.880
interest, which is insane.

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:29.260
These are huge interest rates.

00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:31.600
It's also an enormous
industry in the US.

00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:34.405
It's more stores than McDonalds
and Starbucks combined,

00:46:34.405 --> 00:46:36.280
which I'm not sure how
many stores there are,

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.740
but I think there's
lots of them.

00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:41.410
And people pay huge
interest rates,

00:46:41.410 --> 00:46:43.360
and it's a huge
industry of doing that.

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:46.060
What's kind of funny about
payday loans, in some ways,

00:46:46.060 --> 00:46:49.810
is actually in some ways, it's
an odd thing of the world--

00:46:49.810 --> 00:46:50.860
that's sort of an aside--

00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:53.230
as in workers have worked
already for 20 days.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.540
In some sense, the
employer owes them money.

00:46:55.540 --> 00:46:58.090
But instead, they're
essentially taking loans

00:46:58.090 --> 00:47:00.040
from a salary that's
actually, in some sense,

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.290
theirs already anyway
in various ways.

00:47:02.290 --> 00:47:03.670
But that's just an aside.

00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:05.480
So that's a huge industry.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:06.950
You were saying
something similar,

00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:08.140
which is credit card debt.

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:10.420
Usually there, the
annual interest rate

00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:11.560
is lower than that.

00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:15.648
It's something like 20% in many
cases, sometimes also higher.

00:47:15.648 --> 00:47:17.440
There's lots of credit
card debt in the US.

00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.315
And you can think of
this as like essentially

00:47:19.315 --> 00:47:20.980
signs of short-run impatience.

00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:26.500
What you see is people
wanting to spend money now

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:27.460
on various things.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.020
And they get the
gains of doing that.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.480
The cost of that comes sometime
in the future when you actually

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:32.350
have to pay it back.

00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.790
Finally, there's also some
evidence of payday effects.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:41.210
These are often involved
in things like people,

00:47:41.210 --> 00:47:44.410
for example, who get food
stamps or any other monthly

00:47:44.410 --> 00:47:47.110
or other cash
transfers-- that people

00:47:47.110 --> 00:47:50.380
get either food stamps
or money at some point

00:47:50.380 --> 00:47:53.050
conditional/unconditional
cash transfers

00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:54.490
at the beginning of the month.

00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:56.933
And then usually, there's
these cycles in consumption

00:47:56.933 --> 00:47:59.350
or also expenditures, where
at the beginning of the month,

00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.930
people live large and
have lots of money.

00:48:01.930 --> 00:48:07.030
Same is also true for graduate
students on their stipends.

00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:12.010
The first weeks or months
after getting your paychecks

00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:13.280
often is really great.

00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.353
And then it sort of declines
over the course of that cycle.

00:48:16.353 --> 00:48:17.770
The same is also
true, by the way,

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:21.160
for farmers and harvest cycles
in India and other places.

00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:23.230
And then usually towards
the end of the cycle,

00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:25.750
people either are hungry,
or have low caloric intake,

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.880
or are just not very happy.

00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:30.130
That's a very common phenomenon.

00:48:30.130 --> 00:48:33.683
And at the heart of that, there
is some short-run impatience,

00:48:33.683 --> 00:48:35.600
in the sense of at the
beginning of the month,

00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:37.267
you're really impatient,
want to consume

00:48:37.267 --> 00:48:40.720
some stuff, and discount what's
in the end of the cycle, what's

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.420
further away, where the
costs are coming, then,

00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.480
in terms of not having
enough resources or money

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:48.730
available anymore.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:52.300
Here's some examples
of payday loans.

00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:54.580
I was wondering
what this woman--

00:48:54.580 --> 00:48:56.230
this is from wonga.com.

00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:59.187
Apparently, they are
advertising with grandmothers,

00:48:59.187 --> 00:49:01.270
because you wonder what
this woman is doing there.

00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:04.540
But what you see here on the
right-hand side is essentially,

00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:08.041
the interest rates are
something in the 1,000%.

00:49:08.041 --> 00:49:10.790
These are the annualized
interest rates.

00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:12.280
These are enormous
interest rates.

00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:16.180
Usually people take
many loans of that.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.560
They also take repeated loans.

00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:20.380
So it's not just as an emergency
where people take a loan,

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.020
but people tend to roll over
these loans over and over

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:25.540
again, and actually pay
lots and lots of money

00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:26.950
to these companies.

00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:30.370
There's often very
high credit card APRs,

00:49:30.370 --> 00:49:33.790
which 20%, 25%, and
so on are very common.

00:49:33.790 --> 00:49:36.160
Again, lots of people have
lots of credit card debt.

00:49:36.160 --> 00:49:38.590
And often, it's again, not
just to deal with shocks.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:39.760
You might say, well,
if you have a health

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.530
shock or some other
shock in the family,

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.960
if people get perhaps unemployed
for a short period of time,

00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.130
maybe that makes sense
to deal with that shock.

00:49:48.130 --> 00:49:51.160
But often, people
tend to roll over

00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.380
this interest for
many, many cycles,

00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:56.920
and keep paying these
really high interest rates.

00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:59.770
Now, in some sense, that's
just empirical evidence.

00:49:59.770 --> 00:50:02.030
That's just a fact that
these things exist.

00:50:02.030 --> 00:50:04.360
However, when you
think that through,

00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:08.210
you get very absurd implications
of this short-run impatience.

00:50:08.210 --> 00:50:10.630
So what I showed you now is
several pieces of evidence

00:50:10.630 --> 00:50:12.640
of short-run impatience.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:14.980
Now taking the exponential
discounting model

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:16.960
very seriously, we're
going to think about some

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.730
of these implications
of what does

00:50:18.730 --> 00:50:22.720
the exponential discounting
model say and imply from that.

00:50:22.720 --> 00:50:25.450
And one way to think
about this is the money

00:50:25.450 --> 00:50:26.770
now versus later choices.

00:50:26.770 --> 00:50:31.060
As I told you before, when
you look at number one here,

00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:32.560
I was asking you
about what makes

00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:35.890
you indifferent between $100
now and $X in two weeks.

00:50:35.890 --> 00:50:41.047
And the median student was
saying something $120, $115.

00:50:41.047 --> 00:50:42.880
And you can think about
what does that imply

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:44.470
for the yearly delta.

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:48.520
Well, it implies for the yearly
delta that it's about 5/6.

00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:50.260
So you're indifferent
between $100

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.700
now versus $120 in the future.

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:56.590
So that must mean the
future is 5/6 as much worth

00:50:56.590 --> 00:50:59.710
as the present is
for you right now.

00:50:59.710 --> 00:51:02.830
Now, that's fine.

00:51:02.830 --> 00:51:05.270
Excuse me, that
was the two weeks

00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:09.760
that was I was asking you
about, $100 now versus X

00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.190
dollars in 2 weeks from now.

00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:13.487
So the two-week delta is 5/6.

00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:15.070
Now you can think
about what does that

00:51:15.070 --> 00:51:18.310
mean for your four-week delta.

00:51:18.310 --> 00:51:20.050
Well, it's 5/6 to
the power of 2.

00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:25.930
So that's essentially you're
indifferent between $100 now

00:51:25.930 --> 00:51:28.600
and $144 in four weeks from now.

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.000
You're also indifferent
between $100 now

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000
and $11,400 in a year from now.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.130
And you're also indifferent
between $100 now

00:51:36.130 --> 00:51:38.020
and I don't even know
what that number is,

00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:40.310
but a very, very large number.

00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:42.490
So if you think the
discount factor is delta,

00:51:42.490 --> 00:51:44.740
and you just roll
that forward, you

00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.510
get essentially
absurd implications,

00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:50.080
the reason being that we
assume the discount factor

00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:50.807
is constant.

00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:52.390
And so that, then,
essentially, if you

00:51:52.390 --> 00:51:56.440
are reasonably impatient
between the present and any time

00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:58.715
in the near future, like
two or four weeks from now,

00:51:58.715 --> 00:52:00.340
that must imply that
you really, really

00:52:00.340 --> 00:52:02.048
don't care about what's
happening in five

00:52:02.048 --> 00:52:04.820
years from now, and so on.

00:52:04.820 --> 00:52:07.210
Now, that's completely
unrealistic.

00:52:07.210 --> 00:52:09.512
The discount factor for
two-week delays in the future

00:52:09.512 --> 00:52:11.470
must be, in some ways,
higher than the discount

00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:13.220
factor for two-week
delays in the present.

00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.803
And that's essentially what the
quasi-hyperbolic, or the model

00:52:15.803 --> 00:52:17.830
I'm going to propose to
you in the next class,

00:52:17.830 --> 00:52:20.540
is going to try and explain.

00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.850
So why is that unrealistic?

00:52:21.850 --> 00:52:23.830
Well, we know for many
situations in the world,

00:52:23.830 --> 00:52:25.810
people care a lot
about the future.

00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:27.130
People save for retirement.

00:52:27.130 --> 00:52:28.540
People invest in education.

00:52:28.540 --> 00:52:29.830
People exercise, often.

00:52:29.830 --> 00:52:31.000
People do problem sets.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.260
People brush their teeth.

00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:33.760
People eat healthy, and so on.

00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.420
People invest a
lot in the future,

00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:38.620
in stuff that happens four
or five, six, seven, 10

00:52:38.620 --> 00:52:39.740
years from now.

00:52:39.740 --> 00:52:42.460
So they care a lot about
the future in some ways.

00:52:42.460 --> 00:52:44.750
Yet we find the
short-run impatience.

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:49.930
So now we need to find some
model that can bridge this gap.

00:52:49.930 --> 00:52:52.780
And so another
way to put this is

00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.960
when you look at the evidence
that we have in terms

00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:58.780
of my time horizon, when
you look at discount

00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:02.350
factors conducted in
studies such as the one

00:53:02.350 --> 00:53:07.330
that I just showed you, or using
real-world decisions, what you

00:53:07.330 --> 00:53:10.060
see usually is that the discount
factor in the very short run

00:53:10.060 --> 00:53:12.880
tends to be very small.

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.755
This is what you see on the
left-hand side of the graph.

00:53:15.755 --> 00:53:17.380
When you look at
further in the future,

00:53:17.380 --> 00:53:19.540
the discount factor
tends to be higher.

00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:22.330
Or another way to put this is
the estimated delta increases

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:23.980
by time horizon.

00:53:23.980 --> 00:53:27.430
Again, that's a violation of the
exponential discounting model.

00:53:30.250 --> 00:53:32.000
So that's the first
piece of evidence.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.730
The second one is
preference reversal,

00:53:33.730 --> 00:53:35.370
dynamic inconsistency.

00:53:35.370 --> 00:53:37.120
What I mean by that
is dynamic consistency

00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.370
is essentially the
property that when

00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:42.850
you make a choice for the future
between two future periods,

00:53:42.850 --> 00:53:45.790
and when the future then
comes absent new information

00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:47.800
or any other things
that have happened,

00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.785
you will stick to that choice.

00:53:49.785 --> 00:53:51.160
A formal decision
or a definition

00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:52.750
here is, the action
a person thinks

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:55.150
she should take in
the future always

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:57.310
coincides with the action
that she actually prefers

00:53:57.310 --> 00:53:59.620
to take once the time comes.

00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:02.320
So if I make a plan
to exercise tomorrow,

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.590
or if I make a plan
to eat salad tomorrow,

00:54:04.590 --> 00:54:05.840
I'm going to actually do that.

00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.080
I'm not going to be,
actually watching movies

00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:11.170
seems like a good idea, or
the potato chips instead

00:54:11.170 --> 00:54:12.550
look better.

00:54:12.550 --> 00:54:14.080
I have perfect
foresight in what I'm

00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.560
going to plan for the future.

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.960
I know my future preferences.

00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.510
And my future preferences for
what I want for the future

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:24.650
coincide with what I actually
want in the future, as well.

00:54:24.650 --> 00:54:28.390
And so put differently, there's
no intrapersonal conflicts.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.180
That is to say what I want
for the future is also

00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:35.810
what my future self
wants for itself.

00:54:35.810 --> 00:54:39.970
And so that's closely
connected to the assumption

00:54:39.970 --> 00:54:43.180
of exponential discounting--
that is to say exponential

00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:46.660
discounting has the assumption
that how much I care between

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.270
the present and the
future is always--

00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:51.280
the weight is always
determined by delta,

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:53.510
and that delta doesn't
change over time.

00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:55.240
So when I think now
about what I want

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.400
in the future, between
a year from now

00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.110
and two years from
now, the difference

00:54:59.110 --> 00:55:01.900
between those or the discounting
will always be delta.

00:55:01.900 --> 00:55:04.390
Once the future
comes, the difference

00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:06.973
between a year from then and--

00:55:06.973 --> 00:55:08.890
at the time, then, it
will be like the present

00:55:08.890 --> 00:55:10.598
and a year from now--
will also be delta.

00:55:10.598 --> 00:55:12.800
So there's no difference there.

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:15.370
So what's the formal argument
of the exponential discounting

00:55:15.370 --> 00:55:16.120
model?

00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:18.010
Well, it is essentially
if at time 0,

00:55:18.010 --> 00:55:19.983
I prefer an action
A over an action B,

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.400
suppose there's
different actions.

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.410
There's action A
and action B that I

00:55:23.410 --> 00:55:26.680
can do starting in period one.

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.040
Well, if I prefer action A over
action B, on the left-hand side

00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.290
there's the utilities
associated with that.

00:55:32.290 --> 00:55:36.670
There's u0 plus delta
times u1 A of action

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:41.050
A plus delta squared of
u2 of action A, and so on.

00:55:41.050 --> 00:55:43.150
If I prefer that over
action B, well, it

00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:45.100
must be that I prefer
the stream of utility

00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:47.590
on the left-hand side
to the stream of utility

00:55:47.590 --> 00:55:49.780
on the right-hand side.

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:53.140
But now that implies if I take
away the u0, because they're

00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:55.030
the same on both
sides, because I'm

00:55:55.030 --> 00:55:59.210
making choices for the future,
and then divide by delta, what

00:55:59.210 --> 00:56:05.740
I get is essentially, again, an
equality that at time 1, again,

00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:11.600
I still prefer option A over
option B. That is to say,

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.720
if I prefer option
A over option B

00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:15.910
at time 0, that
implies essentially

00:56:15.910 --> 00:56:20.395
that I also prefer option
A over option B at time 1.

00:56:20.395 --> 00:56:22.270
So that essentially is
another way to say it,

00:56:22.270 --> 00:56:25.030
is that the exponential
discounting factor

00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:28.610
implies time and consistency.

00:56:28.610 --> 00:56:29.750
Any questions about that?

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:43.962
So what examples do we have
that violate this property?

00:56:43.962 --> 00:56:46.420
We already talked about this
a bit in the previous classes,

00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:49.162
but just remind ourselves.

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:55.930
Yes.

00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:57.640
STUDENT: The betting
on how much weight

00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:59.280
you lose when you're on a diet.

00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.988
You make sure that you'll
want to change your behavior.

00:57:04.988 --> 00:57:06.030
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:08.880
So dieting in general seems
a great example of saying,

00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:11.010
I really would like
to lose some weight,

00:57:11.010 --> 00:57:12.870
or have some target
weight, or some target

00:57:12.870 --> 00:57:14.910
exercising, or a certain
behavior of eating

00:57:14.910 --> 00:57:16.900
and exercising or combined.

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:18.900
And I really would
like to do that.

00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:20.940
For now-- I mean, I
think about the future.

00:57:20.940 --> 00:57:23.118
Often at New Year's
or certain points

00:57:23.118 --> 00:57:24.660
of the year, our
birthdays and so on,

00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:26.460
people think, OK,
I'm going to do this.

00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:27.870
I have great plans and so on.

00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:29.880
They have certain
preferences for the future.

00:57:29.880 --> 00:57:32.340
But then the future comes a
week or a month from then.

00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.310
People don't follow through.

00:57:35.310 --> 00:57:35.850
Exactly.

00:57:35.850 --> 00:57:37.590
That's essentially
a clear example

00:57:37.590 --> 00:57:40.050
of a preference reversal,
which is essentially

00:57:40.050 --> 00:57:42.540
another way of
saying preferences

00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:44.220
are dynamically inconsistent.

00:57:49.310 --> 00:57:50.585
Any other example?

00:58:13.970 --> 00:58:15.316
Yes.

00:58:15.316 --> 00:58:17.534
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]
say we should

00:58:17.534 --> 00:58:19.753
do something, kind of
like this is, like,

00:58:19.753 --> 00:58:22.218
what we want our future to be.

00:58:22.218 --> 00:58:24.808
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:24.808 --> 00:58:25.850
FRANK SCHILBACH: Exactly.

00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:28.627
So that's true for,
did you say exercising?

00:58:28.627 --> 00:58:29.210
STUDENT: Yeah.

00:58:29.210 --> 00:58:32.480
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yeah,
for exercising, exactly.

00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:35.660
I'll show you some examples of
people, for example, signing up

00:58:35.660 --> 00:58:37.770
for gyms that pay
yearly membership fees,

00:58:37.770 --> 00:58:40.250
and so on, that tend
to be very expensive.

00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:41.750
The idea often is
then they think

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:46.910
about they will go to the gym
weekly, or daily, or whatever.

00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:49.850
And then under that assumption
for your preferences

00:58:49.850 --> 00:58:52.650
for the future, then it
makes a lot of sense.

00:58:52.650 --> 00:58:55.298
But then if you then
not actually go,

00:58:55.298 --> 00:58:56.840
or if your preferences
are different,

00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:59.240
then it turns out to be
different in the future, that's

00:58:59.240 --> 00:59:01.070
a pretty bad idea.

00:59:01.070 --> 00:59:03.130
Yes, you were saying.

00:59:03.130 --> 00:59:06.093
STUDENT: So consider
apples or bananas.

00:59:06.093 --> 00:59:08.873
If I'm choosing [INAUDIBLE].

00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.430
FRANK SCHILBACH:
Yeah, to be clear,

00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:22.610
if you just start eating
apples because you

00:59:22.610 --> 00:59:24.658
had too many bananas
in the past, that's

00:59:24.658 --> 00:59:25.950
not what we were talking about.

00:59:25.950 --> 00:59:29.900
So it's not about
people's past choices

00:59:29.900 --> 00:59:32.900
affecting future choices through
some form of habit formation,

00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:35.450
or people getting bored,
or tired, or the like.

00:59:35.450 --> 00:59:38.150
But it's about if I today
choose today I want bananas,

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:42.380
tomorrow I want apples, and then
tomorrow I'm actually saying,

00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:45.950
actually, I don't like
apples, I really like bananas,

00:59:45.950 --> 00:59:47.262
then that would be a violation.

00:59:47.262 --> 00:59:49.220
But it needs to be
something that's essentially

00:59:49.220 --> 00:59:54.440
either new information or
some new options or so on that

00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:56.637
become available.

00:59:56.637 --> 00:59:58.220
In the example that
you're mentioning,

00:59:58.220 --> 00:59:59.360
there was none of that.

00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.600
So that's not quite what
we're talking about.

01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:05.700
More common is-- and there's a
paper that does this, in fact,

01:00:05.700 --> 01:00:08.720
with Dutch employees by Read
and van Leeuwen that essentially

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.630
asked people about
next week first.

01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:12.350
So it asked them
about-- this is actually

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:15.618
an actual company, where
workers were asked, after lunch,

01:00:15.618 --> 01:00:16.910
would you like to have a snack?

01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.950
And what snack would
you like to have?

01:00:18.950 --> 01:00:21.690
Would you like to have
apples or chocolate?

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:24.930
When you're asked to do
that today for next week,

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:27.940
74% chose fruit or
apples, essentially.

01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:31.020
So lots of people tend to want
to be virtuous in the future,

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.580
eat healthily, and so on.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:34.330
When you ask them then
the same question--

01:00:34.330 --> 01:00:36.930
so then in the actual
experiment, what

01:00:36.930 --> 01:00:39.840
they did is then they went
back to the workers, and said,

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.080
oh, I forgot your choice.

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.420
Why don't you choose again.

01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:44.190
Let us know.

01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:46.530
That was a little bit
cheating, but then essentially,

01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:52.620
70% of people, when it comes for
the same day, choose chocolate.

01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:54.870
And here's none of
that, in the sense

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:56.970
of there's no habit
formation, there's

01:00:56.970 --> 01:00:59.233
no people ate too many
apples and now they

01:00:59.233 --> 01:01:00.150
really want chocolate.

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:01.680
That was only one choice.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:03.510
And so now, when I
make some choices

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:05.340
for the future and
the future comes,

01:01:05.340 --> 01:01:09.310
I should stick to that choice.

01:01:09.310 --> 01:01:11.450
Similarly, there's
movie choices.

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.210
It used to be--

01:01:13.210 --> 01:01:15.490
you guys are probably
too young for this--

01:01:15.490 --> 01:01:19.647
Netflix used to send
you movies to your home.

01:01:19.647 --> 01:01:21.730
But often what lots of
people had was this issue--

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:25.180
they had great plans of watching
highbrow, or high culture,

01:01:25.180 --> 01:01:31.005
and often sad or deep
movies in the future.

01:01:31.005 --> 01:01:32.380
There's really
things they wanted

01:01:32.380 --> 01:01:34.480
to watch, be it The
Piano or Schindler's List

01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:37.280
and so on, which
by some category

01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.560
we might call highbrow.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:40.690
But instead, when
the present comes,

01:01:40.690 --> 01:01:44.230
people often like to watch
essentially lowbrow movies

01:01:44.230 --> 01:01:46.870
like comedies, and
so on and so forth,

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:50.080
for example, Four Weddings and
a Funeral, Speed, and so on,

01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:51.538
so action movies or the like.

01:01:51.538 --> 01:01:53.080
And then what would
happen in Netflix

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:55.930
often is you would get all
these movies that you'd really

01:01:55.930 --> 01:01:59.710
love to watch in the future,
but never in the present,

01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:01.720
then get stuck with them.

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:03.970
And there's, in fact,
an example or a paper

01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:06.530
who does this, which essentially
elicits people's preferences

01:02:06.530 --> 01:02:08.530
for what they would like
to watch in the present

01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:09.880
versus in the future.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.350
And what you see,
essentially, is

01:02:11.350 --> 01:02:14.140
people tend to
systematically pick

01:02:14.140 --> 01:02:16.270
for the present,
for tonight, people

01:02:16.270 --> 01:02:19.360
tend to watch or want
to watch lowbrow movies.

01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.990
Action, rom com, or whatever
sounds really good for tonight.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.610
When you think about what would
you like to watch next week,

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:28.660
people tend to pick
highbrow movies instead.

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:37.040
And there's lots of
examples of that kind.

01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:39.350
And so just to summarize,
these preference reversals,

01:02:39.350 --> 01:02:41.870
again, these are not really
possible in the exponential

01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:43.070
discounting model.

01:02:43.070 --> 01:02:44.070
That should not occur.

01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:46.643
That's by assumption not
possible in that model,

01:02:46.643 --> 01:02:48.560
as I just showed you
before, yet we see plenty

01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.120
of examples in the real world.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.110
Now, the third piece of evidence
is demand for commitment.

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:56.670
That's really closely
related to that.

01:02:56.670 --> 01:02:59.000
So one example here is
demand for commitment

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.960
is essentially when you know
that your future preferences

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:05.360
will be different from
your present preferences,

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:07.740
you might engage in
commitment devices.

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.900
What does that mean?

01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:11.957
You might want to change
the prices of your options

01:03:11.957 --> 01:03:12.540
in the future.

01:03:12.540 --> 01:03:14.415
And particularly, you
might want to take away

01:03:14.415 --> 01:03:16.760
some options in the future.

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:20.420
One example is Ulysses
and the Sirens.

01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:23.300
Who knows that story or
can tell me what it is?

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:24.149
Yes.

01:03:24.149 --> 01:03:28.061
STUDENT: So basically,
there are these Sirens,

01:03:28.061 --> 01:03:35.396
and they're singing
and [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:35.396 --> 01:03:45.070
But [INAUDIBLE] but it's hard to
tear yourself from [INAUDIBLE]..

01:03:45.070 --> 01:03:49.552
So he had [INAUDIBLE]
tied to the ship

01:03:49.552 --> 01:03:51.490
so that he wouldn't be able to.

01:03:51.490 --> 01:03:52.760
FRANK SCHILBACH: Yes, exactly.

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:53.510
So here's Ulysses.

01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:57.070
I think he was on his way
back from his long journey.

01:03:59.950 --> 01:04:03.070
He knew that the Sirens
were going to come.

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:05.500
He knew that his preferences
would change in the future--

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.190
that he would not
be able to resist

01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:10.120
their power or their songs.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.880
And so what he did
is he asked his crew

01:04:12.880 --> 01:04:15.070
to bind him to the
mast so he would not

01:04:15.070 --> 01:04:18.672
be able to leave the ship, even
if he wanted to in the future.

01:04:18.672 --> 01:04:21.130
And that's demand for commitment
because he was taking away

01:04:21.130 --> 01:04:24.100
some options in the
future, with a goal

01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:27.040
to change his future behavior,
knowing that his preferences

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:29.800
would change in the future.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.290
If you wonder why the
guys who are rowing

01:04:32.290 --> 01:04:33.430
are not leaving the ship.

01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:35.320
They had wax in their ears.

01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:38.090
I don't know why Ulysses
couldn't use the wax either,

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:41.080
but anyway--

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.060
So that's one example
of a commitment device.

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:45.310
There's another one, which
is sort of financial advice

01:04:45.310 --> 01:04:47.890
that people often get,
which is the following--

01:04:47.890 --> 01:04:51.100
cut up your credit card
and store the cards.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:55.360
If possible, get rid of
all your credit cards

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.040
or put temptation out of reach.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.230
If you really can't do
without a credit card,

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:00.340
limit yourself to one.

01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:03.080
Put it in a tub of water,
and stick it in the freezer.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.380
And so the idea here
is if you really

01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.640
have self-control
problems, well,

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:11.920
when you want to buy
something really quickly,

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:13.660
when temptation
sort of takes over,

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:16.418
you have to limit your
options in some ways.

01:05:16.418 --> 01:05:18.460
So in some sense, have
you some cool down period.

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.498
It takes a while to get your
credit card out of the freezer.

01:05:21.498 --> 01:05:22.040
I don't know.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:23.635
I asked my wife about
is this a thing?

01:05:23.635 --> 01:05:25.510
And she was saying,
well, haven't you watched

01:05:25.510 --> 01:05:27.070
"Confessions of a Shopaholic?"

01:05:27.070 --> 01:05:28.150
I have not.

01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:30.130
If you want to watch
that video, you

01:05:30.130 --> 01:05:33.490
see, in fact, apparently
that is, in fact, a thing.

01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:36.920
But the idea of having
some cool down period,

01:05:36.920 --> 01:05:39.770
which essentially is to
deal with essentially

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:42.430
short-run impatience,
comes in many settings

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:43.390
and many variations.

01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:45.940
In fact, for example, if
you'd like to get married,

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.610
often you have to
go to some office

01:05:48.610 --> 01:05:51.023
and declare that you would
like to get married, and then

01:05:51.023 --> 01:05:52.690
wait for another three
days or something

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:54.370
until you actually get married.

01:05:54.370 --> 01:05:58.450
Often, the idea is people
sometimes come to their senses

01:05:58.450 --> 01:06:00.640
and it takes a few days.

01:06:06.250 --> 01:06:08.410
So what do these examples show?

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:10.450
Well, they show that
people have a tendency

01:06:10.450 --> 01:06:12.010
for immediate gratification.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:17.530
And they tend to
discount quite heavily

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:19.665
in short-term decisions.

01:06:19.665 --> 01:06:21.790
Now, what does the demand
for commitment then show?

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:26.230
It's we, in fact, tend to
disapprove of this tendency

01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:27.460
beforehand.

01:06:27.460 --> 01:06:29.210
That is to say we know
that in the future,

01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:30.400
we might be impatient.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.730
We don't like that.

01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:34.030
And because of that, we
bind ourselves to the mast,

01:06:34.030 --> 01:06:38.950
or we freeze our credit cards,
or some people, at least, do.

01:06:41.630 --> 01:06:43.090
And so all of these
decision makers

01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:44.507
are time inconsistent
in the sense

01:06:44.507 --> 01:06:48.945
that when they make certain
choices for the future, what

01:06:48.945 --> 01:06:51.320
they will want to choose in
the future will be different.

01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:54.040
And knowing that, they will
restrict their options.

01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:59.830
That is to say, different
selves want different things.

01:06:59.830 --> 01:07:03.030
So then what's the
heart of the issue?

01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:04.780
Well, the heart of the
issue is that there

01:07:04.780 --> 01:07:07.533
are conflicts rooted between
short and long-run patience.

01:07:07.533 --> 01:07:09.700
What we want in the short
run is different from what

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:10.868
we want in the long run.

01:07:10.868 --> 01:07:12.910
That is to say when we
think ahead of the future,

01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:14.050
we tend to be very patient.

01:07:14.050 --> 01:07:17.810
There's all sorts of good things
we want to do in the future.

01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:19.420
When the time
actually comes, when

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:22.728
we think about the present,
we tend to be impatient.

01:07:22.728 --> 01:07:24.520
Now the issue with
exponential discounting,

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.400
then, is the exponential
discounting model

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.980
has only one parameter
which captures

01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:32.260
essentially discounting.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.700
But it can sort of--

01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:35.710
by assumption, the
discounting needs

01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:38.080
to be the same across
all time horizons.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.350
That is to say, it can only
match one of those two things,

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:42.520
but not both.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.820
It can only match either your
short-run discounting, but then

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:47.610
the long-run discounting
is off, or you

01:07:47.610 --> 01:07:49.360
can try to match the
long-run discounting,

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.220
but then the short-run
discounting is off.

01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:54.670
So what that tells us,
we need two parameters

01:07:54.670 --> 01:07:57.640
to deal with that.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.440
So what we want, and
I'll talk about this

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:02.570
a lot more in the next class
or in the next few minutes.

01:08:02.570 --> 01:08:04.510
And then in the next
class, we want a model

01:08:04.510 --> 01:08:07.480
that has greater patience
for trade-offs in the future

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:09.700
than for trade-offs
in the present.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.130
And then we want another model.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:14.860
So one is we want different
levels of patience

01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:17.020
over different time
horizons, and we

01:08:17.020 --> 01:08:19.240
want a model that
explains or helps us

01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:21.819
explain dynamic inconsistency.

01:08:21.819 --> 01:08:23.430
So what is that model?

01:08:23.430 --> 01:08:26.937
So I just showed you before the
exponential discounting model.

01:08:26.937 --> 01:08:28.479
That's just what I
showed you before,

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.970
but that's exactly the
same, where essentially,

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:35.470
your discounted or lifetime
utility is essentially

01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:37.779
what's given here,
where we have delta.

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:39.100
It's between 0 and 1.

01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:41.229
And delta is a short-term
discount factor

01:08:41.229 --> 01:08:43.479
and it's a long-run
discount factor.

01:08:43.479 --> 01:08:47.109
If I'm trying to decide
between t and t plus 1,

01:08:47.109 --> 01:08:49.300
the difference between
that is essentially delta.

01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:51.939
And if I decide between
t plus 3 and t plus 4,

01:08:51.939 --> 01:08:55.569
it's also delta that
regulates this factor.

01:08:55.569 --> 01:08:57.880
Now, what does the
quasi-hyperbolic discounting

01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:58.510
model do?

01:08:58.510 --> 01:09:00.399
It has another parameter.

01:09:00.399 --> 01:09:02.800
And this parameter
is called beta.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:06.970
And beta governs, essentially,
short-run discounting,

01:09:06.970 --> 01:09:09.640
while delta is the
long-run discount factor.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.290
What is that telling us?

01:09:11.290 --> 01:09:15.170
Essentially, beta discounts
anything that's in the future.

01:09:15.170 --> 01:09:17.380
So essentially, if you
look at the equation now,

01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:20.050
anything that's in the
future, that's not period t,

01:09:20.050 --> 01:09:22.520
is discounted by beta.

01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:24.350
And then within
any future periods,

01:09:24.350 --> 01:09:26.562
we have another discount
factor that's essentially

01:09:26.562 --> 01:09:27.770
the long-run discount factor.

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:29.149
That's delta.

01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:30.680
Now, why does that help us?

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.600
It helps us because
now we can essentially

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.870
separate short-run and
long-run discounting.

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:37.850
You can say short-run
discounting is governed by beta

01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:41.120
and long-run discounting
is governed by delta.

01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.770
And now we can
match a lot of facts

01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:47.510
that we couldn't match earlier.

01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:48.950
Any questions on that?

01:09:53.140 --> 01:09:53.760
Yeah.

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.890
STUDENT: Yeah, I was wondering
if the evidence [INAUDIBLE]

01:09:57.890 --> 01:09:59.384
was comparable to this.

01:09:59.384 --> 01:10:01.874
Because if you have a
beta that really discounts

01:10:01.874 --> 01:10:06.854
any future consumption,
would the commitment device

01:10:06.854 --> 01:10:08.348
[INAUDIBLE].

01:10:08.348 --> 01:10:10.340
Because many [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:14.867 --> 01:10:17.200
FRANK SCHILBACH: So you're
asking two separate questions

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:17.700
here.

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:20.140
So one question
is, can we explain,

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:21.763
in theory, commitment devices?

01:10:21.763 --> 01:10:23.680
Can we explain essentially--
can we write down

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.870
a theory that says
you should be at least

01:10:25.870 --> 01:10:28.570
under some assumptions,
under some parameters,

01:10:28.570 --> 01:10:30.620
willing to engage in
commitment devices

01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:31.990
to demand for commitment?

01:10:31.990 --> 01:10:35.380
The answer is yes, depending
a little bit on your naivete

01:10:35.380 --> 01:10:37.430
and sophistication, which
we're going to get to.

01:10:37.430 --> 01:10:38.860
But so you in
principle, at least,

01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:42.940
can in theory write down a
version of this model that

01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:45.283
predicts demand for commitment.

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:46.700
You're asking a
separate question,

01:10:46.700 --> 01:10:50.305
which is are these commitment
devices actually going to help?

01:10:50.305 --> 01:10:52.930
So A, are some people are going
to make use of these commitment

01:10:52.930 --> 01:10:54.730
devices, and B, are
they going to help?

01:10:54.730 --> 01:10:56.200
The answer is maybe.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:58.660
In many situations, in fact, no.

01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:01.330
The reason being
often people then--

01:11:01.330 --> 01:11:03.940
they might demand commitment
but then not follow through

01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:06.340
in various ways, which
can be then explained

01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.260
by people are sort
of overconfident

01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:10.560
when it comes to their
self-control problems.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.410
We're going to talk
about this next time.

01:11:12.410 --> 01:11:15.830
So the idea here is that people
might understand that they

01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:16.955
have self-control problems.

01:11:16.955 --> 01:11:18.497
They might demand
commitment devices.

01:11:18.497 --> 01:11:21.190
They might say, I'd like to have
a commitment device to help me,

01:11:21.190 --> 01:11:23.857
but they might underestimate how
bad their self-control problems

01:11:23.857 --> 01:11:24.880
actually are.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.800
So then they demand
a commitment device

01:11:26.800 --> 01:11:29.470
that's actually kind of
helpful but not quite enough,

01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:30.982
that's not powerful enough.

01:11:30.982 --> 01:11:32.440
They demand that
commitment device,

01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.868
but then they
actually fail and do

01:11:34.868 --> 01:11:36.910
the thing they want to do
anyway, and essentially

01:11:36.910 --> 01:11:39.743
have to pay money, or
other things like that.

01:11:39.743 --> 01:11:40.660
We'll talk about that.

01:11:40.660 --> 01:11:42.910
But that's not a
theoretical problem.

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:46.570
That's an empirical problem,
in the sense of in principle,

01:11:46.570 --> 01:11:48.340
commitment devices should help.

01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:52.120
They might not be able
to do so in practice.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.800
Let me tell you
a little bit more

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.540
about specifics of the model.

01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:57.790
And then we're going to talk
about this in more detail

01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:59.630
next time.

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:02.260
So usually, we tend to
assume that beta is lower

01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.470
than 1 and delta is close to 1.

01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:10.330
So for example, we think beta
is 2/3, or 3/4, or the like,

01:12:10.330 --> 01:12:12.070
and delta equals 1.

01:12:12.070 --> 01:12:15.860
So then your discounted utility
becomes something like this.

01:12:15.860 --> 01:12:17.590
So relative to the
current period,

01:12:17.590 --> 01:12:19.855
all future periods
are worth much less.

01:12:19.855 --> 01:12:21.730
So everything in the
future, essentially, you

01:12:21.730 --> 01:12:23.410
discount by 2/3.

01:12:23.410 --> 01:12:25.210
And then within
any future periods,

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:27.350
you don't discount
very much anymore.

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:31.740
Usually, we think delta is
0.99, 0.95, or the like.

01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:34.210
So there's some
discounting in the future.

01:12:34.210 --> 01:12:37.390
You care more about stuff that's
one year from now compared

01:12:37.390 --> 01:12:39.800
to 10 years from now
or 30 years from now,

01:12:39.800 --> 01:12:41.350
but not that much differently.

01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:43.690
You care a lot about whether
stuff is in the present

01:12:43.690 --> 01:12:46.960
versus in two weeks from
now or in a year from now.

01:12:52.570 --> 01:12:57.370
And so then similarly, if beta
equals 1/2 and delta equals 1,

01:12:57.370 --> 01:12:59.630
then again, your
discount function--

01:12:59.630 --> 01:13:02.140
this is the d of tau that I
was writing down earlier--

01:13:02.140 --> 01:13:04.420
is essentially you care
about the present 1,

01:13:04.420 --> 01:13:07.540
and then everything
in the future is 1/2.

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:09.880
So again, relative
to the present,

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:13.750
all future periods are
worth less, weighed 1/2.

01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:17.620
And then all discounting takes
place between the present

01:13:17.620 --> 01:13:20.740
and the immediate future.

01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:22.570
So then again, what
we can explain now

01:13:22.570 --> 01:13:25.090
is essentially short
run impatience.

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:27.225
I'm essentially impatient
between the present

01:13:27.225 --> 01:13:27.850
and the future.

01:13:27.850 --> 01:13:30.100
Anything that's in the future
is essentially far away

01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:34.120
or gets the weight of, in this
case, 1/2 or 2/3 or the like.

01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.580
I can also explain
long-run patience,

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:39.852
because essentially across
the years in the future,

01:13:39.852 --> 01:13:41.560
there's no discounting
happening anymore.

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:45.010
People tend to be
relatively patient.

01:13:45.010 --> 01:13:47.200
And so then,
decisions, of course,

01:13:47.200 --> 01:13:51.880
are very sensitive to the
timing of costs and benefits.

01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:54.500
We're going to talk
about that next time.

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:58.840
So as I said in the email I sent
you, readings until Wednesday

01:13:58.840 --> 01:14:01.270
are the [INAUDIBLE] paper.

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:03.820
We're going to discuss or
finish the same set of slides

01:14:03.820 --> 01:14:05.157
that I've given you now.

01:14:05.157 --> 01:14:06.740
Let me know if you
have any questions.

01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:08.400
Thank you.

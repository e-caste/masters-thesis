00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:09.519
How do you design, test, and build a small
and completely edible boat that propels itself

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.830
through your cocktail? This is a complicated
problem, but it--and many other problems like

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.430
it--can be solved systematically, by breaking
the problem down into several key phases.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:26.430
In this video, we'll explore how two MIT graduate
students created these Cocktail Cruisers.

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.410
This video is part of the Problem Solving
video series.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.260
Problem--solving skills, in combination with
an understanding of the natural and human-made

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.010
world, are critical to the design and optimization
of systems and processes.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.640
Hi, my name is Lisa Burton and I am Nadia
Cheng. We are graduate students in Peko Hosoi's

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.800
lab in the Department of Mechanical Engineering
at MIT.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.260
Today, we're going to tell you about a class
project that we worked on that turned into

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.890
a product called cocktail cruisers.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.350
After watching this video, you should be able
to identify the steps of the problem solving

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.459
process and recognize that the problem solving
process is iterative.

00:01:04.459 --> 00:01:09.320
Take a moment to think about your approach
to problem solving. What steps do you generally

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.770
go through?

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.140
Please pause the video and take a moment to
think about it. Then continue playing the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.140
video to hear about one approach. [PAUSE]
While different people might approach a problem

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.899
in different ways, using an explicit strategy
for problem solving can be very helpful. You

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:37.210
can find different problem solving strategies
in the literature. The strategy that we will

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.899
present in this video is adapted from Don
Woods and Philip Wankat.

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.740
The first step is to define the problem. What
are the criteria? What are the constraints?

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.219
After defining the problem, you need to gather
information. What are the knowns and unknowns?

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.819
What content knowledge is needed to solve
the problem? Have others worked on a similar

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:01.350
problem before?

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.350
The next step is to explore. Look at the problem
in different ways. Brainstorm different approaches

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:16.610
to meeting the criteria given the constraints.
After exploring, you need to pick one approach

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.640
to solving your problem and plan your strategy.
Determine the resources needed to carryout

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.829
your plan. A flowchart, outline, or schematic
might be useful.

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.560
After the planning phase, it is time to act.
In this step, you follow your plan to create

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.460
your solution.

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.670
Once you have a solution, you need to check
it. Does it make sense? Does it meet the criteria?

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.740
Where does it fall short? Is any troubleshooting
required? If the solution isn't satisfactory,

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.150
it might be necessary to explore some more
and create a new plan.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.680
Once you have your final solution, what have
you learned that you can generalize to other

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.040
contexts?

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.560
Finally, disseminate your results so that
others can learn from your solution. This

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.620
could be through a class discussion, a formal
presentation, or a scientific paper.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.780
Now that you are familiar with the problem
solving process, see if you can identify where

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.550
I used these steps as I worked on a class
project.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.200
This project began in my Fluid Dynamics class,
which focused on interfacial phenomena and

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.780
was taught by my other advisor, Professor
John Bush. The main criterion, or requirement,

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.920
for the project was to conduct an experiment,
perform a simulation, or design a product

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.790
fundamentally based on a topic covered in
class. There were also some constraints placed

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.780
on the project. We only had three months to
work on it and a limited budget. Other than

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.660
that, it was very open--ended.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.480
It was really up to me to define the problem
from there. Learning about the Marangoni effect

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.829
inspired my design. The Marangoni effect arises
from a gradient, or difference, in surface

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:57.820
tension.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.230
We can see the Marangoni effect by adding
a drop of soap solution to a container of

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:08.740
water. The soap solution reduces the surface
tension of the water locally, causing flow.

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:12.920
Using black pepper flakes as a tracer, we
can visualize the flow away from the area

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.410
of low surface tension.

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.849
Surface tension is simply a property of liquid
that results from intermolecular forces. In

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:26.199
the bulk of a uniform liquid, each molecule
experiences a zero net force because molecules

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.430
that exert equivalent force on each other
surround it. At the surface of a liquid, molecules

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.879
from the liquid experience a non-zero net
force pulling them toward the bulk of the

00:04:35.879 --> 00:04:40.900
liquid because they are not completely surrounded
by like molecules. This causes the surface

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.680
to minimize its area.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.759
The high surface tension of water allows objects
denser than water, such as a paper clip or

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:50.889
a water strider, to float on the surface.

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.509
If an object has a high surface tension liquid
on one side of it and a low surface tension

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:59.669
liquid on the other side, the difference in
surface tension will cause the object to move

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.370
toward the high surface tension liquid.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.330
We can see that happen in this demonstration
of a toothpick floating on water. If we add

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.360
a few drops of soapy water to one side of
the toothpick, the toothpick moves away.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.180
I decided that I wanted to make a miniature
boat that would be propelled by a surface

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.729
tension gradient. I wanted to propel the boat
in a water-based environment, with the ultimate

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:27.960
goal of using it in a food setting. This required
that the second liquid be safe to eat since

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.539
it would mix with the water. At this point,
I wasn't concerned with making the boat edible,

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:36.669
because it could simply be removed by hand
from the food.

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.590
Therefore, the problem we needed to solve
was how to design a boat that could be propelled

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.740
by the Marangoni effect. This included the
identification of a liquid that was edible

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.419
and had the appropriate surface tension for
use as the propellant.

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:55.419
I started gathering information about different
fluids that had a lower surface tension than

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:00.430
water. I also looked at the existing designs
of other boats, noting what propellants they

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:05.219
used and their method for releasing the propellant
into the surrounding water.

00:06:05.219 --> 00:06:09.719
To identify important physical features of
the boat, I did some calculations, starting

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:14.809
with a simple force balance diagram. We can
represent the boat as a rectangular prism

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:19.529
for now. Viewing the boat from the side, we
see just a rectangle.

00:06:19.529 --> 00:06:23.729
In the vertical direction, the forces acting
on the boat are the force due to gravity,

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.729
or the weight of the boat, and the buoyancy
force, which is equivalent to the weight of

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:33.139
the water displaced by the boat and the meniscus.
You've probably noticed that water in your

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:37.400
drinking glass slightly climbs up the wall
of the glass. This is the meniscus and it

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:42.490
depends on the material of the object (for
instance, the boat or the glass), the liquid,

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.469
and the gas (in our case air).
Therefore, to make the boat float, we must

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:52.400
ensure that the weight of the water displaced
balances the weight of the boat. This is Archimedes'

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:53.990
principle.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.719
In the horizontal direction, we have the force
of surface tension of the "fuel" on the left

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:02.210
side and the force of surface tension of the
surrounding fluid, which we will assume is

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:08.349
water. If these forces aren't equal, the boat
must accelerate, according to Newton's Laws.

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:12.430
Therefore, to make the boat move faster, we
want the difference in surface tension to

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.919
be as great as possible.

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:20.520
Once the boat is moving, drag becomes important.
Drag opposes the direction of motion and increases

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.839
with velocity and the cross sectional area
of the boat. A smaller cross-sectional area

00:07:25.839 --> 00:07:28.729
will allow the boat to move faster.

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:33.180
To ensure that the boat remains stable, the
center of mass must be below the center of

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:38.460
buoyancy. Otherwise, the boat will tip over
and sink. As I explored different ideas, it

00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.469
became clear that I needed to do some testing.

00:07:41.469 --> 00:07:46.110
To find an edible, low surface tension liquid
to act as the boat's fuel, I tested different

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:51.808
liquids I found in my kitchen, from hot sauce
to sugar water to vinegar. From these tests,

00:07:51.808 --> 00:07:57.249
I decided that I needed a low surface tension
liquid that was also volatile, or evaporative.

00:07:57.249 --> 00:08:01.539
This is necessary for the boat to continue
to move; otherwise, the fuel surrounds the

00:08:01.539 --> 00:08:06.719
boat equally on all sides so that no surface
tension gradient exists and therefore the

00:08:06.719 --> 00:08:08.349
boat does not move.

00:08:08.349 --> 00:08:12.849
The best fuel I found was liquor. The alcohol
content of the liquor and the surface tension

00:08:12.849 --> 00:08:18.259
are inversely related. Therefore, using a
very high alcohol content liquor will result

00:08:18.259 --> 00:08:19.969
in a faster boat.

00:08:19.969 --> 00:08:24.770
I started sketching ideas for what the boats
might look like. Drawing on previous research,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.529
the initial design had an open fuel reservoir
in the middle of the boat with a small slit

00:08:29.529 --> 00:08:35.289
that allows the liquid to leave the reservoir.
The overall shape was a very simple boat shape.

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:39.849
After testing materials for a while, it was
time to come up with a plan. I decided that

00:08:39.849 --> 00:08:45.350
I needed to create a prototype so I enlisted
the help of my lab mate Nadia. She suggested

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:50.470
using a 3D printer to create the boat in the
Edgerton Center student shop.

00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:55.060
The only way we were really going to know
if the boat design was going to work was to

00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:02.060
actually try it. It was time to act, and having
rapid prototyping technologies—such as 3D

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:08.170
printers—available significantly expedites
the testing and iteration process. The 3D

00:09:08.170 --> 00:09:14.540
printer requires that we develop 3D representations
of our boat design in CAD. There are various

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:20.860
types of 3D printing technologies; the one
we used utilizes fused-deposition modeling,

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:26.600
or FDM. The way it works is that there is
a spool of a thin plastic "thread" that is

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:32.360
fed through a nozzle. The nozzle heats the
plastic to soften it so that the plastic can

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:38.660
be laid out to build a 3D object. Basically,
it is like piling a piece of string on top

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:44.560
of itself to make a 3D shape. Because the
boats needed to be less dense than the liquids

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.050
they were to float on, we specified that the
boats were to be printed "sparsely", such

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:55.110
that the plastic thread was to be laid out
loosely whenever possible in the interior

00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:57.209
of the boats.

00:09:57.209 --> 00:10:03.250
Once we had our boat, it was time to check
and see if it did want we wanted it to. Of

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:08.790
course, our very first boat wasn't the ideal
solution. The reservoir was too small and

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:13.180
the boat was too large; it didn't hold enough
fuel and moved slowly because of the mass.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:20.180
But it gave us insight into what we needed
to change. We modified our plan, created a

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:27.660
new design, and tested it again. After some
troubleshooting, we went through several design

00:10:27.970 --> 00:10:33.980
iterations. We examined many different boat
designs and liquors to use as fuel until we

00:10:33.980 --> 00:10:35.829
had a design we were happy with.

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:40.870
I presented my project to the class at the
end of course. I successfully stayed within

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:46.170
the design and project constraints. I created
a boat that used edible materials for propulsion

00:10:46.170 --> 00:10:49.690
through the Marangoni effect.

00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:55.730
After completing the course project, we continued
to pursue this idea. We wanted to improve

00:10:55.730 --> 00:11:01.319
our design and also make the boat out of edible
material so that they could be used as a fun

00:11:01.319 --> 00:11:08.319
garnish for drinks. This required us to generalize
our solution to a new situation. We constructed

00:11:09.389 --> 00:11:16.110
soft, flexible molds out of silicone by 3D
printing rigid plastic molds that the silicone

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.800
molds could be made from.

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:25.279
After creating the molds, we tried several
edible materials for the boat including candy,

00:11:25.279 --> 00:11:31.399
chocolate and marshmallows. We quickly discovered
that the density of the material was a common

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.959
limiting factor.

00:11:33.959 --> 00:11:40.750
After further testing, we found two materials
that worked: edible wax and gelatin, which

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.819
we foam as it sets to reduce the density of
the boat. We've since disseminated our product.

00:11:46.819 --> 00:11:51.509
I won a design award at a competition at MIT
and we're currently working with Chef Jose

00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:56.379
Andres to incorporate our design into his
restaurant. Additionally, an article in the

00:11:56.379 --> 00:12:01.420
American Society for Engineering Education
PRISM magazine helped spread our ideas and

00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:04.160
product to a broader audience.

00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:08.160
To recap, in order to solve this problem,
we had to

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.220
define the problem
gather information

00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:15.500
explore
plan

00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:21.240
act
and then check our solution

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:27.319
We were able to generalize our solution to
a new context and then disseminated our results.

00:12:27.319 --> 00:12:32.100
The problem solving process really helped
us approach this problem and break it down.

00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:37.050
By consciously using a problem solving process,
you will find that you will become a more

00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:44.050
confident and better problem solver. Best
of luck!

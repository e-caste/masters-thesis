00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.550
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: So we're
very excited about this class.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.430
And, excuse me, this
is the only time

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.050
I get you until
after spring break.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.550
So I'm not going to--
well I'll see you, maybe,

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.540
but in terms of this class,
I come on after spring break

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.565
and then I get you for
the rest of the semester.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.440
And so what I want to do
in the next 20 minutes

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.320
is just give you a little
preview of what's coming.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.350
Now, did you, Professor
Wheeler, did you

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.010
talk about laptops and stuff?

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.460
So let me talk about
that for a minute.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.880
Any of you who had me in 3012
know that, for me, what I

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.380
would prefer is that when I'm
lecturing, that you don't have

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.720
your laptops open and
you're not pulling

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.000
your sort of under the
table texting, unless--

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.200
now there is an exception.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.351
Who knows the exception?

00:01:17.351 --> 00:01:18.720
Can anybody remember?

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.600
Nobody actually took me
up on this last fall,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.140
but if you really feel
so inspired by what

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.300
I'm talking about or
what we're talking about

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.328
that you need to send a
tweet and summarize it,

00:01:31.328 --> 00:01:33.870
or you need to broadcast this
information that you're getting

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:36.750
in the class out to more
people to bring them in,

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.720
then that's OK.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.060
Otherwise, I'd really
prefer it because if you

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.620
open your laptop,
what you're doing

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.037
is you're creating
a field of view

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:47.200
for all the people behind
you to get distracted.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.298
Same with the phone under
the table trick, right?

00:01:49.298 --> 00:01:50.340
A lot of people see that.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.080
It's a little distracting.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.830
The point of the class
is discussion, right?

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.380
So we're going to
have slides, we're

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.930
going to talk about slides,
but if you don't ask questions,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.370
it's a lot less useful.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.690
You won't learn as much.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:07.620
So I really like
getting interrupted.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.740
Just, like, yell out something.

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.930
I don't know.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.030
In 3012, the key
word was "entropy."

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.150
You could yell out "entropy"
any time, and I'd turn around

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.770
and we'd talk.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.200
Here, it could be, like,
"quantum" would be a good one,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.700
right?

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.710
But I really want you to ask
the question when you have it,

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.800
because if we have a
discussion on the spot

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.110
about your question, that's
a learning moment, right?

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.190
That's a chance to
learn more for everyone.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.700
So I mean, the studies are in.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.320
I'm not just being
kind of touchy feely

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.195
about learning here.

00:02:38.195 --> 00:02:39.570
There's a lot of
rigorous studies

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.100
about how people learn best.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.930
And it's in those discussions
where you learn the most.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.140
So please, interact.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.240
Ask questions.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.940
Now I'm going to motivate
quantum mechanics.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.220
And how many of you have seen
quantum mechanics before?

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.560
How many of you have never
seen quantum mechanics?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.360
It's OK.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.490
See, the thing is, what's
going to be really--

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.420
so here's the thing.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.550
You don't have to have
seen quantum mechanics

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.510
to feel your complete
oneness and total enjoyment

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:12.030
of the quantum mechanical
simulations we're going to do.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.797
This is going to be really
exciting whether you've

00:03:14.797 --> 00:03:17.130
seen quantum or not because
we're going to kind of start

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:19.440
slowly and then
we're going to learn

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.630
how to simulate the behavior
of quantum mechanics.

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.130
So what I want to do
today is just tell you

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.910
sort of why this is exciting
and why this is important.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.166
OK?

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:32.620
OK, so that's what--

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.540
and I'll give you a more
detailed outline when

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.907
I come on for my part
after spring break,

00:03:36.907 --> 00:03:38.740
but those are sort of
the highlights of what

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:40.520
we're going to touch on.

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.900
Now I thought that--

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.970
OK, so I think Professor Wheeler
may have shown this, right?

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.850
So did you show the computers?

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.790
Does anybody know where the
fastest computer on the planet

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.880
is?

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.400
We've gotten a
lot faster, right?

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.960
So some of these
were actually here.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:58.130
The Whirlwind was here.

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:00.213
So you can see the number
of operations per second

00:04:00.213 --> 00:04:03.000
has increased
dramatically, right?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.400
Where's the fastest
computer in the world today?

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.110
Good guess.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.860
Yeah.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:12.450
Anybody know who has it?

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:13.830
It's Google, right?

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.230
It's Google.

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.149
And I keep emailing
them, and they

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:19.980
don't respond to my
emails, because I

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.750
want to get some
cycles on that machine.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.610
But they actually need
to build power plants

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.500
for those computers.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.290
And Professor Wheeler
showed that there's

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.790
like one little rack where your
simulations are going to go.

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.730
Well Google has like
thousands of those.

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:37.440
Now I thought I'd share my
own personal history here.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.315
Has anybody seen either
of these in a museum?

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.320
This is the good old days.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.710
We used to call it the Trash-80.

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.098
It was a couple of years ago.

00:04:48.098 --> 00:04:50.640
But that's how I grew up, just
working on machines like this.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.290
And then there was
this one which had

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.910
a cartridge you could put in.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.890
You could save your
data to a tape.

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:56.695
OK?

00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:57.570
Do you remember that?

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.780
No, you're too young.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:04:59.610
Yeah.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.740
So now, when you save data to a
tape, you literally are-- like,

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.660
you guys think about
megabytes, gigabytes.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.240
You would save like
a 10k file and it

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.190
would take you 10 minutes, OK?

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:12.570
And it would have these beeps.

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.910
Anyway, someday you can
check it out in the museum.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.400
But my favorite is the
startup screen, right?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.950
So this one would just come
on and it would say "ready."

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.910
I like that.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:24.480
Right?

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.590
So those are the old days.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.890
OK, so Professor Wheeler
talked about this.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.280
He talked about how
I'm not even on here.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.460
I'm all the way down here.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.030
Hey.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:37.530
You know?

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.910
But last but not least, right?

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.020
Bottom but really
important, because we're

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.210
talking about bottom-up
materials understanding

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.600
and design, and this level--
understanding and being

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.340
able to compute
this level is going

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.590
to be important for all the
rest of the levels, right?

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.900
Now, what we're going
to talk about when

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.150
I come on in the
second half is not just

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.170
those potentials, right?

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.190
So quantum mechanics gets you
those potentials between atoms

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:06.500
that you can then feed into
there to there to there

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.250
to there, but it also gets
you real materials behaviors

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:14.060
directly that you cannot
get in any other way.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.940
Somebody tell me a quantum
mechanical object that's

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.310
just like really quantumy.

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.250
What makes you think quantum?

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.980
Electrons, yes.

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.520
I love that.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.353
That's another word.

00:06:29.353 --> 00:06:31.280
If you want to say
electrons any time,

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.170
in the middle of a
sentence, say electrons.

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:34.100
Scream it out.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.570
That's it, right?

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.020
Electrons are quantum
mechanical objects, right?

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.880
You really need
quantum mechanics

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.960
to know what an
electron is doing.

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.290
And it turns out that knowing
what an electron is doing

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:47.790
is really important for
a lot of properties, OK?

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.220
So I'm going to give you a sense
of that in this little preview

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:53.000
today.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.690
OK, so we're all
the way down there.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:07:00.050
Now there are a lot of quantum
mechanists and some of you

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.010
may recognize some
of these people.

00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:03.020
So these are the people.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.810
And you can tell, in contrast
to thermodynamicists,

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:10.290
they don't have
mutton chops, right?

00:07:10.290 --> 00:07:12.680
And I don't know that we could
say there's a trend here.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.000
I mean they look nice here.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:14.600
A little less.

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.260
Well anyway, they look-- these
were some really smart people.

00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.320
These are revolutionizing
sort of the way we

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.250
understand and view the world.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:26.330
And we'll talk about what
their contributions were as we

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:27.930
sort of start the quantum part.

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:28.430
OK?

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.320
And we'll talk
about the problems.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.750
You see, because they had
this thing for a long time.

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:37.250
Right?

00:07:37.250 --> 00:07:39.800
They had classical physics
which described the world really

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.360
well.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.120
Did we need quantum mechanics
to send people to the moon?

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.780
Turns out, no, right?

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.850
So we can do a lot
without quantum mechanics,

00:07:49.850 --> 00:07:51.980
but there started to
become these problems

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.620
that classical mechanics
couldn't describe.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.498
OK, and so we'll talk
about those as well.

00:07:56.498 --> 00:07:58.040
I'm not going to
talk about them now.

00:07:58.040 --> 00:08:00.500
But those problems
became so great,

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:04.010
that it just sort pushed
these great thinkers

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:06.800
of the time, of 100
years ago into developing

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.450
a completely new
theory for the world,

00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:09.700
for the way we view the world.

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.470
Here's one of the funny things
about quantum mechanics.

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:17.090
This is a quantum
mechanical ball.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:19.310
And I just threw it into a wall.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:21.080
Right, and look
at what happened.

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.420
Now, we'll talk
about this later.

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.670
A quantum mechanical
ball is not a ball.

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:27.920
It's a spread out thing, right?

00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.460
It has a probability
associated with it.

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.260
But look at what
happens there, right?

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.963
Look at this.

00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:35.630
What's going on?

00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.690
Somebody tell me
what's happening.

00:08:37.690 --> 00:08:38.659
What is it?

00:08:38.659 --> 00:08:39.644
Tunneling.

00:08:39.644 --> 00:08:44.660
Now, is tunneling something that
happens in like real systems

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.670
and materials?

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:48.380
Yeah, you bet it does.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.010
Electrons do it all the time.

00:08:50.010 --> 00:08:53.240
And if you can't predict this
kind of tunneling behavior

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.362
correctly then you can't design
optoelectronic materials,

00:08:57.362 --> 00:08:58.820
right, at least if
you want to know

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.300
what the electrons are going to
do, which is pretty important.

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:07.270
OK, now, it turns out
that, OK, so that's

00:09:07.270 --> 00:09:09.730
a quantum mechanical
ball thrown into a wall.

00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:11.110
Uh-oh, OK.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.632
And then there is this
very simple reaction

00:09:13.632 --> 00:09:15.340
that shows the behavior
of the electrons.

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:17.530
We already saw that, so
I'm going to skip that.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.110
But so this can
be complex, right?

00:09:20.110 --> 00:09:22.240
Things are going
like through walls.

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.530
That's weird.

00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:25.590
Isn't that kind of weird?

00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:28.060
I mean, that's weird.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:29.530
If I throw a ball
into a wall, you

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:32.350
don't usually expect part
of it to keep going, right?

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:33.910
You expect it to bounce back.

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:36.310
But if I throw an electron
into that wall, some of it

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:38.140
will keep going, right?

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.820
And this is even weirder.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:42.820
If I start mixing materials
together and reacting them,

00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.390
those electrons can behave
really, really weirdly.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.470
That's quantum mechanics.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:53.740
And we'll come to feel
our enjoyment and oneness

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:54.880
with that weirdness.

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:56.020
It's really fun actually.

00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:59.830
It's really fun to think
about how weird it is.

00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:03.523
The nice sort of thing, and
also the really hard thing

00:10:03.523 --> 00:10:05.440
about quantum mechanics
is that there's really

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.540
only one equation that
we're going to care about.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.160
This is it.

00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:13.140
Right, that's the
Schrodinger equation.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:16.365
And you can see that it's just
a partial differential equation.

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:19.440
It shouldn't be so bad, right?

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.348
Well, so it turns out that this
equation tells us everything

00:10:23.348 --> 00:10:25.140
that we need to know
for quantum mechanics.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:26.790
It tells us about this thing.

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.265
That's the wave function.

00:10:28.265 --> 00:10:30.150
OK, and the wave
function is the word

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:33.400
we use to describe that ball,
that quantum mechanical ball.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.873
OK, it's that
weird shape, right?

00:10:35.873 --> 00:10:38.040
And it turns out that if
we can solve that equation,

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.450
then I can get the shape of PSI.

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:41.730
And then I know a lot
about the quantum mechanics

00:10:41.730 --> 00:10:43.440
of the system.

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:50.250
Now, here's what happens when
you try to solve that equation.

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.570
Here's this equation
written in very simple form,

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:53.472
H PSI equals E PSI.

00:10:53.472 --> 00:10:54.430
Don't worry about that.

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.840
We'll get to that when we
talk about quantum mechanics

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.670
in the second half of the class.

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:05.640
Again, we're not going to
do sort of like quantum 101.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:13.380
We're going to really talk
about the key essence of quantum

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:13.890
mechanics.

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:14.390
OK?

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:17.640
We're not going to go into great
detail of mathematics of it.

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.530
OK, but it's basically
a simple equation

00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:20.650
that you need to solve.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:22.560
So here is that quantum
mechanical ball.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.020
This is just
representing that wave.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:25.520
Right?

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:27.130
This is a plane wave.

00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:29.450
And I'm throwing it into a wall.

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.640
And I just happen to put
another wall behind it,

00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:33.770
spaced like that, right?

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:35.480
Now, how would you
solve that equation?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.050
What's the first
thing you might try?

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.260
Don't say ask Siri.

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:47.250
Actually, you could ask Siri.

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:51.030
Wolfram Alpha Pro is coming out.

00:11:51.030 --> 00:11:54.830
So could you put this
in a Mathematica?

00:11:54.830 --> 00:11:55.330
Right?

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.700
Yeah.

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.480
You could, right?

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.360
It's an equation.

00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.400
It's got boundaries.

00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:00.900
It's got initial conditions.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.820
And here's what you get, OK.

00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.320
So that's a quantum
mechanical ball.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.970
It's the simplest
one you could get.

00:12:05.970 --> 00:12:08.820
It's just a little shape that
you throw into two walls.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:11.350
And these are the equations
you have to solve.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.110
Now, the fun part about this,
which the students in this

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:17.110
class two years ago did not
think was that fun when I gave

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:22.430
this on a homework assignment
was that Wolfram Alpha cannot

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:22.930
handle it.

00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:26.650
Wolfram, Mathematica, Matlab,
you name it, chokes, right?

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.740
You cannot solve these eight
equations and eight unknowns

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:32.427
unless you do some tricks,
and [INAUDIBLE] tricks first.

00:12:32.427 --> 00:12:34.510
I won't give another problem
like this, I promise.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.450
But the point of
this was not meant

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:39.042
to drive the students crazy.

00:12:39.042 --> 00:12:40.250
That really wasn't the point.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:43.780
The point was just to illustrate
how hard this equation actually

00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.970
turns out to be to solve, OK?

00:12:46.970 --> 00:12:47.750
It looks simple.

00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:50.450
It's deceivingly simple.

00:12:50.450 --> 00:12:53.840
We can't solve it even today
without making approximations.

00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.170
And the only reason we can solve
it today for real materials

00:12:57.170 --> 00:13:00.920
is because we've figured out
how to make really important

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:06.740
algorithmic approximations, OK?

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:11.015
The only Nobel Prize given in
computation was given for that.

00:13:11.015 --> 00:13:13.640
I think that might
be on my next slide.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:16.180
And computers have
gotten really fast.

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.680
OK, so I'm skipping
ahead of myself.

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.080
This is a quote.

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.820
So before that,
before we figured out

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.340
how to solve that equation
for real materials,

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:30.190
people like Dirac,
really smart people

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.600
were feeling a
little bit hopeless.

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.830
Right, 1929, "The
underlying physical laws

00:13:35.830 --> 00:13:37.630
necessary for the
mathematical theory

00:13:37.630 --> 00:13:40.030
of a large part of physics
and the whole of chemistry

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:42.310
are thus completely known."

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:43.310
What's he talking about?

00:13:43.310 --> 00:13:46.170
What's completely known?

00:13:46.170 --> 00:13:46.920
Yeah, how?

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:49.550
How come?

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:50.450
Right?

00:13:50.450 --> 00:13:51.800
They had kind of nailed it.

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.030
Right, like in the
late 1800s, they

00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:58.220
were like looking at the
world and saying, why?

00:13:58.220 --> 00:13:59.880
This doesn't compute.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:02.810
And then they sort of spent
30 years developing the theory

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:03.975
of quantum mechanics.

00:14:03.975 --> 00:14:06.350
And that's why he's saying
it's kind of completely known.

00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:08.690
And the difficulty is only
that the exact application

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.910
of these laws leads
to equations, much too

00:14:10.910 --> 00:14:12.900
complicated to be soluble.

00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:13.400
Right?

00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.070
That was 1929.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.472
He did say later if there's
no complete agreement

00:14:19.472 --> 00:14:21.680
between the results of one's
work and the experiment,

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.320
one should not allow oneself
to be too discouraged.

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.630
I like that quote.

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.600
It turns out that happens in
simulation quite a bit, right?

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.240
And that has to do with
the fact that you can't

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.800
solve the equations exactly.

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.730
You have to make approximations.

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:39.650
And knowing where you are
in accuracy phase space

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:42.180
is something that's very
important in this class.

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:44.080
And we'll be talking
about that a lot.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:44.580
OK?

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.550
But don't be discouraged.

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:49.070
Nice words of
encouragement from Dirac.

00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:52.558
OK, so that Nobel Prize
I was talking about,

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:53.600
that was actually shared.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.500
But one of the people who
won it was Walter Cohn.

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:01.400
And he won it because
of an approximation,

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.820
which I'll talk
about a little bit

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.120
when we go into
quantum mechanics.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.103
And it turns out
that you still can't

00:15:08.103 --> 00:15:09.770
solve the equations
of quantum mechanics

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:12.590
without making approximations.

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:14.720
Even with the fastest comp--

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.810
how many transistors
are on the fastest--

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.280
how many transistors can
we put on a chip today?

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.151
Does anybody know?

00:15:25.378 --> 00:15:26.170
10 billion?

00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:27.670
That's a good guess.

00:15:27.670 --> 00:15:30.110
I think 3 is where we're at.

00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:32.990
And how many neurons
in your brain?

00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:35.180
100 billion, right?

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:36.800
So we're getting close.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.960
We're getting real close.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.000
They're catching up, man.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.520
It costs as much money
to make a transistor

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:49.130
on a chip with 3 billion
transistors on it

00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.280
as it does to print a single
letter in a newspaper.

00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.910
OK, so we are very good at
printing lots of transistors.

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:01.970
That has dramatically
accelerated how much CPU power

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:02.600
we have.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:06.590
And it's still worthless,
worthless for the equations

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:09.982
of quantum mechanics, unless
you make simplifications.

00:16:09.982 --> 00:16:12.440
So we're going to have to talk
about those simplifications.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.673
Because they're still not
solvable unless you make

00:16:14.673 --> 00:16:15.590
these simplifications.

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:17.720
And that's why the Nobel
Prize was given for it.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.024
That's how important it is.

00:16:20.024 --> 00:16:20.840
OK?

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.070
Once you do that, once
you know the model,

00:16:25.070 --> 00:16:27.530
once you develop that model
that Professor Wheeler talked

00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:29.390
about for quantum
mechanics, then

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.610
you can go ahead
and do simulations.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.650
And you can get some really
interesting properties out.

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:37.910
Like in this case,
this is lead titanate.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.430
And there's some really
interesting magnetic properties

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:42.413
that have to do with
where those electrons are.

00:16:42.413 --> 00:16:44.330
So I'm going to just
give you a couple of sort

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:51.050
of motivational slides for why
understanding these electrons

00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:52.280
is so important.

00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.380
OK, and then I'll stop.

00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.780
How many know what this is?

00:16:58.780 --> 00:17:00.930
Yeah.

00:17:00.930 --> 00:17:02.200
Quantum dots?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:02.700
Yeah.

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:03.670
What's happening here?

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:06.334
Why are they different colors?

00:17:06.334 --> 00:17:07.709
AUDIENCE: Different
energy bands.

00:17:10.083 --> 00:17:11.750
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: OK,
and somebody said,

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:13.720
what's the reason for that?

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.900
Different sizes.

00:17:15.900 --> 00:17:17.089
Different sizes.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.780
Isn't that weird?

00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.905
Why is that?

00:17:21.905 --> 00:17:25.230
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.950
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
That's a good try.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:30.480
Not quite right.

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.690
Good guess.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:34.020
Any other ideas?

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:38.060
Well, there's always the
go to answer, quantum.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.800
It's quantum mechanics.

00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.580
Right?

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.180
It's quantum mechanics.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.660
This is red and that's blue.

00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.620
Aqua?

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:46.250
Purple?

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:47.240
I don't know.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.780
Because of quantum
mechanics, right?

00:17:50.780 --> 00:17:52.930
Let's break that down.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:54.700
It has to do with--

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.620
this isn't really
breaking that down,

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.840
but it's related because
it's nanotechnology.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.340
OK?

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.130
So I'm going to explain
that in just a minute.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.200
Nanotechnology.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.000
Well, you all know
about nanotechnology.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.240
The scientist in Spider-Man
was a nanotechnologist.

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:11.410
Did you know that?

00:18:11.410 --> 00:18:16.600
And The Incredible Hulk, because
of nanotechnology, right?

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:27.940
So that's how Hollywood
views nanotechnology.

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.492
But why am I telling
you about nano?

00:18:29.492 --> 00:18:31.450
Well, because the effects
I'm about to describe

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.480
is because of nanotechnology.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.980
You hear a lot about
nanotechnology,

00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.720
and there's a lot
of hype around it.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.093
There's also a lot
of there there, OK?

00:18:38.093 --> 00:18:40.510
And I love this, in case you
haven't seen the size scales.

00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:42.580
I know you've probably
all seen too much nano.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.350
But I love this one
where you're sitting

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:47.610
on top of some random
dude, and then you go out.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:48.610
Have you guys seen this?

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:51.070
10 times, 100
times, 1,000, right?

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:54.280
And you keep going
out, OK, and that's

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:57.280
how far you are when you
go out by 10 to the 9th.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:01.020
And then you start again and
you go in by the same amount,

00:19:01.020 --> 00:19:01.520
right?

00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.395
And so that's sort of
just trying to give you

00:19:03.395 --> 00:19:04.840
a sense of the scales, right?

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.890
So that's nano is going in by
the same amount you'd be going

00:19:09.890 --> 00:19:11.240
out to get to here, right?

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.020
It's kind of cool.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.030
It's small stuff.

00:19:14.030 --> 00:19:15.780
Why is that interesting?

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:17.810
Oh, the press seems to know.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:19.880
It's because super
cows and nanotechnology

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.502
will make ice cream healthy.

00:19:21.502 --> 00:19:23.210
That's actually still
my favorite article

00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:25.400
about nanotechnology.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.060
It's about healthy ice cream.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.370
Actually, my favorite part
of this is the definition.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:32.900
I love this definition.

00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.080
It is also experimenting with
nanotechnology or the science

00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:39.200
of invisibly tiny things.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:40.340
Right?

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:41.150
We just saw them.

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:42.080
They're red and blue.

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.080
They're not invisible.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:49.300
OK, right, I highlighted it.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.080
OK, back to that example, right?

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:52.960
So why am I
connecting nano here?

00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:58.180
Well, because quantum
feels nano a lot.

00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:01.400
Quantum and nano very
often go hand in hand.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.233
Now, it depends
how nano you mean.

00:20:03.233 --> 00:20:04.900
Some people say they're
working on nano,

00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:06.525
and they're really
at like 0.8 microns.

00:20:06.525 --> 00:20:08.650
That's sort of cheating, right?

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.270
But not really.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:13.300
Hey, this is like some
millions of nanometers.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:14.710
I guess that's working on nano.

00:20:14.710 --> 00:20:20.181
If I take a bulk semiconductor,
what's a semiconductor?

00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:25.990
It's this picture.

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.360
Somebody give me an example
of a semiconductor material.

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.110
AUDIENCE: Silicon?

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.340
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Silicon.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.120
Right?

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:32.912
What are the properties
of a semiconductor.

00:20:32.912 --> 00:20:35.200
Somebody tell me one
property of a semiconductor.

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:35.800
Yeah.

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:36.860
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.760
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Yeah, yeah.

00:20:40.760 --> 00:20:42.140
It's got a gap.

00:20:42.140 --> 00:20:46.330
Not too big, not too
small, just right.

00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:46.830
OK?

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:48.420
We'll be coming
back to that a lot,

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.360
because that gap is
something you can predict

00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:51.360
using quantum mechanics.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.760
You have to have quantum
mechanics to predict it.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.980
Now, it turns out that if I
look at this piece of silicon,

00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.330
it's optically not
that exciting, right?

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:05.390
That will go along with
those different colors.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:07.140
Right, it just sort
of looks like charcoal

00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.850
actually, unless you process it.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:11.900
Might be a little shiny,
but it's kind of boring.

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.540
If I take out my little
nano ice cream scooper--

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:16.890
I'm a theorist, right?

00:21:16.890 --> 00:21:19.020
So this is how I
view experiments.

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.480
And you now scoop out
a little piece of it.

00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:22.500
We have a name for that.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.985
That's called the
quantum dot, right?

00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:25.860
That's a quantum dot.

00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.900
But it's nothing more
than a little tiny piece.

00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:30.150
It's a nano piece, right?

00:21:30.150 --> 00:21:30.810
What happens?

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.690
What happens is if you do
that, that's when you get this.

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:35.260
Right?

00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:35.760
Why?

00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:42.370
Back to our-- you know
what the answer is.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.290
Quantum mechanics, OK?

00:21:44.290 --> 00:21:45.160
Here's the reason.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:49.120
Something called
quantum confinement, OK?

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:53.230
It turns out that if I
create an optical excitation

00:21:53.230 --> 00:21:54.730
in this bulk
semiconductor-- let's

00:21:54.730 --> 00:21:56.150
say I shine a laser on it.

00:21:56.150 --> 00:21:58.450
That's about the worst
PowerPoint graphic

00:21:58.450 --> 00:21:59.080
I've ever seen.

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:04.930
Anyway, but it's a laser.

00:22:04.930 --> 00:22:06.230
And you shine a light on it.

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:09.940
Well, happens is, you
see these little objects

00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.910
that I said were very quantum
mechanical, the electron.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:13.600
Right?

00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:15.850
What happens is the
energy from the light

00:22:15.850 --> 00:22:19.808
kicks an electron out of
what's called its ground state.

00:22:19.808 --> 00:22:21.350
Well, we're going
to talk about that.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.402
I'm getting really
excited myself.

00:22:23.402 --> 00:22:25.360
And when it gets kicked
out of its ground state

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.080
it leaves behind a hole,
or a positive charge, OK?

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.550
So now you've got
a negative charge

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:34.060
and a positive charge that have
been made in this material.

00:22:34.060 --> 00:22:36.070
They've been made by light.

00:22:36.070 --> 00:22:38.740
Why might I be
excited about that?

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:40.130
No pun intended [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:40.130 --> 00:22:41.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:42.730
Thank you, one person.

00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:49.750
If you've suffered through me
last fall then, you know it.

00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:51.947
So why might I be
excited about that?

00:22:51.947 --> 00:22:53.140
AUDIENCE: Solar power?

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.307
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Thank you.

00:22:54.307 --> 00:22:55.210
Solar power!

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.550
We just made electricity
from sunlight.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:02.170
Now, it turns out that electron,
that positive and negative

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.970
charge like to be a
certain distance apart.

00:23:04.970 --> 00:23:08.620
Right, and bulk
silicon, 5 nanometers.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.590
Right, it's called
the exciton radius.

00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:12.550
When you create an
electron hole pair,

00:23:12.550 --> 00:23:14.618
they kind of like each other.

00:23:14.618 --> 00:23:16.410
Well, they're very
weakly bound in silicon.

00:23:16.410 --> 00:23:19.490
But they have a distance
that they like to hang out,

00:23:19.490 --> 00:23:20.750
in this case 5 nanometers.

00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.880
And what that means
is that when I run out

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:27.750
of real estate in the material,
and I do the same thing,

00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:29.630
well, they don't
have anywhere to be.

00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:31.760
They want to be
out here, but they

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.070
can't be, because there's
no material out there.

00:23:34.070 --> 00:23:36.980
Right, so if I'm less
than that exciton radius,

00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:41.100
then my excitation is squeezed.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:42.100
We have a name for that.

00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.030
It's actually called
quantum confinement.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:44.530
Why?

00:23:44.530 --> 00:23:47.050
Because these are very
quantum mechanical objects.

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.005
You need quantum mechanics
to describe them.

00:23:50.005 --> 00:23:51.880
And what you've done is
you've squeezed them.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:54.140
You've increased
their kinetic energy.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:58.030
And that is the reason
the color changes.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:01.120
That's the reason
the band gap changes.

00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.790
And so you can see that
the physical confinement

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:07.750
of this excited state leads
to this very unique quantum

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:15.050
effect, which is that the light
emitted depends on size, right?

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.290
One example of many, of
sort of the beauty that

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.790
comes from understanding
the quantum

00:24:19.790 --> 00:24:21.832
mechanics, and we're going
to be able to simulate

00:24:21.832 --> 00:24:23.700
this in the second
part of this class.

00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:24.380
OK?

00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:29.030
Now, that is a really
useful piece of technology.

00:24:29.030 --> 00:24:30.408
Quantum dots are being used--

00:24:30.408 --> 00:24:32.450
does anybody know about
the uses of quantum dots?

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:34.350
I mean, they're already
in companies, right?

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:34.850
Yeah.

00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:35.840
AUDIENCE: Solar cells.

00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.630
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Solar cells, right?

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:43.830
LED TVs, biomarkers.

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:45.060
It's big in the biotech.

00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:46.050
Oh, sorry.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:47.552
I just stole your answer.

00:24:47.552 --> 00:24:48.760
And I didn't want to do that.

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.450
Any other ideas?

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:51.992
They're really useful, right?

00:24:51.992 --> 00:24:53.700
And they're getting
more and more useful.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:57.840
Very interesting, all
quantum mechanics.

00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.090
That gets me really excited,
because I work on energy.

00:25:00.090 --> 00:25:03.840
And I'm not going to do an
energy talk, don't worry.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.050
But I work a lot on energy.

00:25:07.050 --> 00:25:11.940
And the fact of the matter is
that this is a map of the US.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.490
And it shows where there's
good to excellent resources

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:19.830
in some renewable technologies,
like PV, red and orange.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.260
Biomass, green and light green.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.280
Wind.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.020
Number one most
utilized renewable

00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.630
resource in the world
today is wind, right?

00:25:27.630 --> 00:25:30.150
So if you look at this,
there's only a few pockets

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:31.920
where you're sort of--

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:35.760
sorry, man, it's gas or oil.

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.700
Now, but we don't use hardly
any of these resources, right?

00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:42.270
And the reason, as we all
know, is cost and efficiency.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:46.140
But in so many of these
technologies, not wind,

00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.500
in this case, but PV,
biomass, and in a number

00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.960
of other technologies,
solar fuels,

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:55.750
the key is pushing
electrons around.

00:25:55.750 --> 00:25:56.890
That's the key.

00:25:56.890 --> 00:25:59.740
It's pushing electrons up a
hill, and letting the electrons

00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.450
fall down a hill, right?

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:07.442
I mean, one of the oldest
ways to store energy is what?

00:26:07.442 --> 00:26:08.910
Who knows?

00:26:08.910 --> 00:26:11.550
It goes way back.

00:26:11.550 --> 00:26:14.050
Still really used around
the world, including the US.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:14.550
Yeah.

00:26:14.550 --> 00:26:15.605
AUDIENCE: Steam.

00:26:15.605 --> 00:26:16.980
JEFFREY GROSSMAN:
Steam is a way.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.100
That's true.

00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:18.870
Think older.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.430
Pumping water.

00:26:22.430 --> 00:26:23.370
Who said that?

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:23.870
In the back.

00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:25.010
Pumping water.

00:26:25.010 --> 00:26:26.930
You pump water up a hill.

00:26:26.930 --> 00:26:28.910
You hold it in a big lake.

00:26:28.910 --> 00:26:31.893
And you let it come down
when you need energy, right?

00:26:31.893 --> 00:26:33.560
You pump it up when
you have the energy,

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:34.977
and let it come
down when you need

00:26:34.977 --> 00:26:39.230
it is a terribly inefficient way
to store energy, but it works.

00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:42.470
And basically, what we need to
do for so many of these energy

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.320
technologies is figure out
how to more efficiently pump

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.750
electrons up a hill.

00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:50.720
That's basically what
we're doing, right?

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:51.980
And that's quantum mechanics.

00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:55.040
Because by definition,
electrons need quantum mechanics

00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.360
to describe.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:56.870
Right?

00:26:56.870 --> 00:27:00.230
So we're going to pump
electrons up hills and around

00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:01.622
in the second part
of this class.

00:27:01.622 --> 00:27:03.080
And you can tell
your friends that.

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:06.020
And it will impress
them, I promise you.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.600
I always like to help
you make conversation

00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.420
when you're at the bar.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.700
Because here's a solar cell.

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.550
Do I have any time left?

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:17.810
Yeah, I got a couple minutes.

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.012
I'm almost done.

00:27:19.012 --> 00:27:19.970
I'm really almost done.

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.200
Cause we're going to
work on solar cells.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.283
First, we're going to spend
sort of the first half

00:27:23.283 --> 00:27:26.510
of the quantum part
learning about quantum,

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:29.580
and how to simulate
that equation, right?

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:30.830
We're going to do simulations.

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.340
And then we're going to
apply those simulation

00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.780
tools to real problems.

00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:38.960
So we're going to study
solar cells, for one.

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:39.757
And look at this.

00:27:39.757 --> 00:27:41.090
Here is how a solar cells works.

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:43.880
Well, that's what you see if
you take like a core six class,

00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:45.880
and if you think about
it from the device scale.

00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:48.080
But here's what's happening
inside that solar cell.

00:27:48.080 --> 00:27:49.220
Sunlight comes in.

00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:51.740
Squiggly lines are
always sunlight, right?

00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:52.970
Squiggly line comes in.

00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:55.350
And there is that electron.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:56.077
You can tell.

00:27:56.077 --> 00:27:56.910
Actually, you can't.

00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:57.930
But there it is.

00:27:57.930 --> 00:28:00.450
And it gets promoted
up, cause that light

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.930
has energy with it that knocks
this electron up an energy.

00:28:03.930 --> 00:28:05.850
And look at what it left behind.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.180
A hole, just like I showed
you in silicon, right?

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:11.310
In those quantum dots.

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:14.570
But in a solar cell, you don't
want them to recombine and emit

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:15.470
light.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.750
You don't want them to
shine different colors.

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:20.850
In a solar cell, you want
to get those charges out.

00:28:20.850 --> 00:28:22.970
You want to get that
electron out of one side,

00:28:22.970 --> 00:28:25.940
and get that hole out of
the other side, right?

00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.550
Every single step here,
converting the photon

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:31.770
into an electron, electron
and hole thermalize.

00:28:31.770 --> 00:28:33.690
They couple to the
solar cell, and they

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:36.637
waste all that energy coming
back up to the valence

00:28:36.637 --> 00:28:37.470
and conduction band.

00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:40.260
They wasted all
this heat, right?

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:43.710
The electron hole pair diffuses.

00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:44.280
Hello there.

00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:49.670
Welcome to 302-1.

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.620
This thing can move around.

00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:53.010
This pair can move around.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:53.510
And

00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:55.940
Then you've got to
get them apart, right?

00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.280
And you got to get
them out, right?

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.620
Every single step
that's critical

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.420
is a quantum mechanical step.

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:06.020
Right, you cannot describe these
processes unless you can solve

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:08.660
Schrodinger's equation, OK?

00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:10.325
So we'll be talking
about that and how

00:29:10.325 --> 00:29:11.450
to make solar cells better.

00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:15.770
For example, in silicon,
people put charts like this up.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.770
More than 80% of the solar
cells you buy today are this.

00:29:18.770 --> 00:29:22.770
They're multi crystalline
silicon, right?

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:26.550
Now, the solar cells
in your calculators

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.440
are amorphous silicon.

00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:29.940
And the reason
is, they're cheap.

00:29:32.638 --> 00:29:33.430
They're very cheap.

00:29:33.430 --> 00:29:35.170
But they're very inefficient.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:37.687
And so you see things-- but
they could be thin and flexible.

00:29:37.687 --> 00:29:38.520
That's kind of nice.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.350
But they're just
not that efficient.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:42.850
And so you start
seeing things like,

00:29:42.850 --> 00:29:44.760
well, here, let's compare
these two crystals.

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:45.635
Here's a crystalline.

00:29:45.635 --> 00:29:46.350
Here's amorphous.

00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:47.733
There's a gap.

00:29:47.733 --> 00:29:49.150
Difference in
energy between those

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:52.940
states that the electron gets
excited to, very different.

00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:54.370
There's absorption coefficients.

00:29:54.370 --> 00:29:55.130
Very different.

00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.970
There's mobilities.

00:29:55.970 --> 00:29:57.520
And this is actually
what kills it.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.230
Those holes are so slow.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.740
Right?

00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:04.530
Well, how can you
compute those things?

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:05.690
Let me hear it.

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:06.440
AUDIENCE: Quantum.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.200
JEFFREY GROSSMAN: Thank
you, quantum mechanics.

00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.220
We can calculate, and we
will calculate these things

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:15.850
for these kinds of materials.

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:19.030
And maybe you'll find a way
to make amorphous silicon have

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:21.210
faster holes.

00:30:21.210 --> 00:30:23.010
And if you do that,
please come talk to me.

00:30:23.010 --> 00:30:23.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:26.100
I'd be really interested,
because I've been working

00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.585
on that problem for many years.

00:30:28.585 --> 00:30:30.210
But these are the
kinds of things we're

00:30:30.210 --> 00:30:33.990
going to do, OK, in this class.

00:30:33.990 --> 00:30:35.410
And I'll tell you
one quick story.

00:30:35.410 --> 00:30:37.230
I was at a conference
on solar energy.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:39.990
And they gave out
calculators as kind

00:30:39.990 --> 00:30:42.690
of solar powered calculators,
solar energy calculators.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:44.850
Solar energy conference,
solar powered calculators.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.400
And we opened one up.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.320
And it turned out it
was battery powered.

00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.400
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.820
And there was a little piece
of amorphous silicon solar cell

00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:57.570
in there, but it
wasn't wired up.

00:30:57.570 --> 00:31:01.310
And the reason is, these are
so poor in their efficiencies,

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.810
right?

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:02.520
We've all seen it.

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:03.750
You need to be in direct sun.

00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:05.260
And you can't see it anymore.

00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:05.760
Right?

00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:06.870
Why?

00:31:06.870 --> 00:31:09.762
If we could figure out how
to boost that whole mobility,

00:31:09.762 --> 00:31:11.220
we could get their
efficiencies up.

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:12.178
They'd cost a lot less.

00:31:12.178 --> 00:31:13.823
We'd make a game
changing difference.

00:31:13.823 --> 00:31:15.240
So these are the
kinds of problems

00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.050
that we're going to work
on in the second half.

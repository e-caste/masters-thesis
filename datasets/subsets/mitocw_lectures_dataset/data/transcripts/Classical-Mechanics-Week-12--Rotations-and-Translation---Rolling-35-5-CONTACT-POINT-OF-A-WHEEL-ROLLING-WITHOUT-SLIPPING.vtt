00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.450
So I would like to now
consider the wheel that

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.330
is rolling without slipping.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.250
And what I'd like
to do is consider--

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.900
let's draw the wheel
rolling without slipping.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:24.170
And I'd like to consider the
contact point between the wheel

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.910
and the ground.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.330
And I'd like to understand what
the velocity of that contact

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.830
point is.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.820
And the result is surprising.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.350
Now, we know by our law of
the addition of velocities--

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.840
let's call that the point P--

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.180
that the velocity of P is the
velocity of the center of mass,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.160
and that pointed this way,
plus the velocity of the point

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.150
P as seen in the
center of mass frame.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.690
And in that frame, every
single point on the rim

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.520
was just doing circular motion.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.200
So that velocity is in
the opposite direction.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.520
And the vector sum is the
velocity of this point P

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.210
as seen in the ground frame.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.700
So we want to consider the
magnitudes of these two terms.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.570
The velocity in the
center of mass frame

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.060
of a point on the rim has a
magnitude equal to r omega.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.789
And we said that the velocity
of the center of mass,

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.580
we call that V cm.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.590
Now, the rolling without
slipping condition

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.270
was that these two
magnitudes were equal.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.690
V cm equals r omega,
or the velocity

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.150
of the point on the rim in
the center of mass frame

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.710
is equal to the center of
mass velocity of the wheel.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.880
And therefore, the
velocity P, which

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:05.630
is the sum of these two
vectors for the contact point--

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.639
so that's when P is in
contact with the ground--

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:12.950
is equal to 0.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.910
So what we say is
that the contact point

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:34.130
is instantaneously at rest
with respect to the ground.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.260
And that's what really is
the mystery of a wheel that's

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.680
rolling without slipping--
that this contact point is

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.750
the sum of these two
vectors, and it's

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.910
instantaneously at
rest with the ground

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.280
when the wheel is
rolling without slipping.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.890
The other points
are certainly not.

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.760
Remember, up here, these
two vectors pointed

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.280
in the same direction, so that
vector has twice the magnitude

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.310
of either one.

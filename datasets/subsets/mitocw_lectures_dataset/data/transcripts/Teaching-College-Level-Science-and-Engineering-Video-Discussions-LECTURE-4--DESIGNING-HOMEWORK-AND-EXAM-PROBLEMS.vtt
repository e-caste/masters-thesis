00:00:22.516 --> 00:00:25.840
PROFESSOR: OK, welcome
everyone.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.870
It's 8:05, well, 9:05.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.680
So today's lecture and
discussion is about how to

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.800
make good problems, whether
it's on homework problems,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.670
exams, even problems in class.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.530
Its general principles that
you can use constructing

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.710
questions that you ask, so
problems broadly conceived.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.450
Now why problems?

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.640
So problems are, I think, one
of the central ways of

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.010
thinking about teaching.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.940
And I'll show you how problems
fit into the grand scheme of

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.395
this course, of rethinking all
the aspects of teaching.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.490
So one way that I like to think
about teaching is called

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.410
backward design.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.600
So this is a way of designing a
whole course, could even be

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.780
for a curriculum.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.840
And doing problems is
one aspect of that.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.750
So why is it called
backward design?

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.530
Well, it's backward from
the usual way.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.960
So I'll show you what backward
is and then show you what the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.210
usual way is.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.950
So in backward design the
highest-level thing you figure

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.160
out-- not necessarily the first
thing you figure out,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.380
but the highest level thing--
is your course goals.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.820
And that then feeds to OK, if
those are your course goals

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.509
how do you know whether students
have reached them?

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.759
And that's problems.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.010
Problems, tasks, projects,
whatever it may be, things

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.260
that students are going to do.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.630
And so generally speaking,
things to do.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.850
And then given that you've
operationalized the goals in

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.910
these problems what are you
going to do in class, so that

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.500
students actually are able to
do these kind of things?

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.210
OK, so that is backward
design because the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.030
usual way is the following.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.280
You say, OK, well, you have
a bunch of lecture notes.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.030
Where do you have those?

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.950
Well, either the last person
who taught the course gives

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.220
you their lecture notes.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.990
Or you just take the standard
book in the subject and you

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.070
just do the lectures one per
chapter or one week per

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.130
chapter, something like that.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.420
And you just go through
in the order.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.180
So in the usual way you
start with this.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.980
And then you think oh, whoops,
oh yeah, I've got to make some

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.930
problem sets.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.020
And oh, some exams.

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.200
Well, what have we done this
last couple weeks?

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.060
OK, that's what we're
going to do.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.100
So the usual way is you
start with here.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.000
And then you get here.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.830
And you somehow never
get here.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.570
The course goals are,
basically, to

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:26.670
get through the book.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.850
Right?

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.070
That's the implicit
course goal.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.820
But it's never explicitly
planned.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.490
So that's a terrible way,
but the normal way

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.420
of designing a course.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.490
So this is backward design.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:41.880
So this is due to Wiggins
and McTighe.

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.530
OK, so here we're going to
be discussing this today.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.910
So we're doing this first.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.030
And then the next session
is this one.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.300
And I think the session after
that is, what do you do in

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.700
class, interactive teaching
and things like that.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.860
So why am I doing it
in this order?

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.730
Well, in the levels of
abstraction these

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.550
are the most abstract.

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:16.530
And this is the most concrete,
OK, what question I'm going to

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.600
ask students in class now.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.920
And this is things like goals.

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.790
I want them to really understand
conservation.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:23.980
They're really high level.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.600
So I think if you start here, by
trying to figure out course

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.780
goals, I haven't found that
works very well for me because

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.050
it's too high level.

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.560
I can't think about course goals
in absence of actual

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.670
problems and things I want
students to be able to do.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.830
So this has the right level
between concrete and abstract.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.390
So it's actually where
I start my thinking.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.370
Now, you may actually find you
want to start somewhere else

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.400
on the continuum.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.200
But this is what I found
works quite well.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.260
You start here, you
operationalize what your goals

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.140
are in the problems that you
think are interesting.

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.580
And then you look
at the problems.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.980
And that sort of gives you an
idea of the course goals.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:05.740
And then you think about
the course goals.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.090
And that helps you think
of problems.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.580
But I start here.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.330
And then, once I have things
like that, then class time is

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.750
actually much easier to plan.

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.030
Because class often is going
to be problems like this,

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.550
related to this,
maybe shorter.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.120
But it's easier to plan
here after that.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:24.400
Whereas we start here, you
don't know, you're

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.630
back in the old way.

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:26.910
So I don't want to start here.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.430
This is too abstract,
so I start here.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.160
So that's why we're
doing this now.

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.970
And then next week we're
going to do this one.

00:05:39.444 --> 00:05:39.942
Question?

00:05:39.942 --> 00:05:41.796
AUDIENCE: So when you say
that you're setting

00:05:41.796 --> 00:05:42.510
goals for your class--

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:43.470
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:47.160
AUDIENCE: So if you say that,
basically, setting the goals

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.303
for your class, or for
your own course.

00:05:50.303 --> 00:05:52.768
So when you design your course,
basically you write

00:05:52.768 --> 00:05:56.219
out some kind of goals
you want to reach?

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:57.698
So how do you then
do the problem?

00:05:57.698 --> 00:06:00.590
Do you go in detail
before you've even

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:01.960
started the whole class?

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.185
Or do you do it that on
a week-to-week basis?

00:06:04.185 --> 00:06:06.000
PROFESSOR: Oh, what do
I tell the students

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.980
about the course goals?

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.932
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I mean, if you
say, OK, basically, you have

00:06:09.932 --> 00:06:14.106
your goals and then you
design problems so you

00:06:14.106 --> 00:06:14.941
can reach the goals?

00:06:14.941 --> 00:06:19.300
But then do you also design
these problems before you even

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.952
start the whole lecture?

00:06:20.952 --> 00:06:22.445
The whole semester?

00:06:22.445 --> 00:06:26.500
PROFESSOR: Oh, well,
it's pretty rough.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:31.030
I mean, usually the first time
you teach the thing it's too

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:32.070
abstract to design--

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:32.870
I find--

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.110
everything in advance.

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:39.400
Maybe that's my extrovert
nature, which is that I find

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.730
it hard to design things for
people I don't know.

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.190
If I don't know the audience I
don't even know what to say.

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.300
So I want to actually teach the
course one time at least.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.440
So then the audience becomes
concrete for me.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.260
So really, the first time
through the course nothing is

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.950
ever ideal.

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.370
And you're doing everything
on the fly.

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.610
But the second time through the
course, you can actually,

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.650
basically, make all the problems
ahead of time.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:06.930
So the second time through the
course you actually refine

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.165
your goals and your
problems together.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:16.653
So that shows you the structure
of where we are and

00:07:16.653 --> 00:07:17.930
where we're going to
go and then later.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.040
So this is two weeks from now.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.060
Today, here.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.600
So how do you make problems?

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:36.710
Well, the fundamental principle
is, again, deduced

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:41.140
by induction from what happens
with regular problems.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:46.860
So if you remember, I gave you
an example earlier of the

00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:49.470
results of standard
problem solving.

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.640
And I'll just remind you that
we're putting up the

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.890
percentages again.

00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:10.770
OK, so after doing lots
and lots of standard

00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:13.880
multiplication problems,
students were--

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.310
if you remember-- unable to
do the following problem.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.360
So these 13-year-Olds and
17-year-Olds were asked to

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:34.140
estimate 3.04 times 5.3.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:35.690
So here were the answers.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:47.410
So they were given four
possible answers.

00:08:47.410 --> 00:08:50.670
And they could also
not answer.

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.920
So this is no answer.

00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.010
So that's the age 13.

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:15.090
So of the four possible
answers--

00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:18.690
or let's say no answer is
possible as well-- so five,

00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:24.580
they're 1% over 1/5 will
get the correct answer.

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.765
So that's a bit depressing.

00:09:25.765 --> 00:09:27.355
So you think, oh, OK,
the 17-year-olds

00:09:27.355 --> 00:09:28.605
are going to be better.

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.360
And they are, but they only
have 37% correct.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:43.650
OK, so here is a serious
problem,

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.090
which is rote learning.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:48.090
And that's the fundamental
thing to

00:09:48.090 --> 00:09:50.690
avoid when doing problems.

00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:54.020
So these students-- especially
the 17-year-olds--

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:56.470
were actually perfectly capable
of doing exactly

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:56.805
multiplication.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:59.410
So on the same test they were
asked questions like multiply

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:04.420
2.7 by 8.32 and given just empty
space on the page to

00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:05.700
multiply it out.

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.380
About 80% did it right.

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.160
So it's not that they don't
know how to multiply.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.510
They just don't know what
multiplication means, which is

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:15.720
a far more serious problem.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.870
I'd rather they knew what
multiplication meant and

00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:21.300
didn't really understand,
didn't

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:22.420
really know how to multiply.

00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:24.950
Because the algorithm you can
teach them later if they

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.280
understand what it means.

00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.990
But if they don't even
understand what it means that

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:31.270
basically it's 3 times 5, so
it's got to be somewhere

00:10:31.270 --> 00:10:33.920
around 16, they don't understand
what multiplication

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.050
means or the number
system means.

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.880
That's a far more
serious problem.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.830
And that's produced by the
traditional kind of problems.

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:44.730
The traditional kinds of
problems are, generally

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:48.140
speaking, too low level
and can be solved,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.550
to easily, by rote.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:51.890
Even the complicated traditional
problems can

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.710
eventually be turned
into rote learning,

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.880
and that's the danger.

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.490
So the main goal in making
good problems is--

00:11:01.490 --> 00:11:02.030
I would say--

00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:06.190
how to make problems that
fight rote learning.

00:11:06.190 --> 00:11:06.360
OK?

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.560
That produce long-lasting
actual conceptual

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.090
understanding along with
whatever else you're trying to

00:11:12.090 --> 00:11:13.500
produce and teach.

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.030
But really, fight the rote
learning because that is the

00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:18.730
fundamental problem.

00:11:18.730 --> 00:11:25.110
So a way of thinking about
this is to categorize the

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:28.260
levels of thinking that you're
expecting of students when

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.710
you're asking them
to do a problem.

00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:37.060
And for that there is work
from 50 years ago now--

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.440
which is still useful--

00:11:49.530 --> 00:11:53.810
which is Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:11:53.810 --> 00:11:55.990
So Bloom's Taxonomy--

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.960
let's see, when was it?

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.210
I think it was 1956.

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:03.300
I think it was '56.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.420
I'll put a handout on the
website for you which

00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.930
summarizes in one page.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.690
But I'll summarize it
even shorter here.

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:17.050
So what is it a taxonomy of?

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.530
Well, when you read the title
the book, it's Bloom's

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:23.440
Taxonomy of Educational
Objectives.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.430
And it's not really clear if
that's going to be useful for

00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:26.040
anything at all.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:27.630
Because you think, what
the hell is that?

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.690
So the shortest way of
understanding it is that it's

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.290
six levels.

00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:39.980
And each level is higher than
the one previous to it in

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:44.590
terms of the level of thought
required of a student.

00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:46.010
So it's not really
a strict order.

00:12:46.010 --> 00:12:49.810
You can have really hard
questions that seem to be low

00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:51.940
level just because they address
misconceptions.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:54.190
But generally speaking,
it's a rough order.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:13:02.950
So the order is knowledge
questions.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:08.360
Those are things like define,
name, state, list, You know,

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:10.150
it's basically almost rote.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:13.340
I mean, these are the kind of
problems that everyone would

00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.850
agree are rote, state
the definition of

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:18.100
Newton's Second Law.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.950
The second is comprehension.

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.650
So that's sort of like
knowledge but

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:35.432
it's a higher level.

00:13:35.432 --> 00:13:39.110
So that's being able to grasp
the meaning of the material,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.170
not just recite the facts.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:46.040
But generally, that doesn't
include the idea of being able

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.170
to transfer it to
new situations.

00:13:48.170 --> 00:13:50.008
That's where application
comes.

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:57.410
So can you apply the material
to something?

00:13:57.410 --> 00:14:04.660
For example, often compute,
demonstrate, show that, those

00:14:04.660 --> 00:14:07.210
are typical verbs that
are used when you

00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:08.460
have application questions.

00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:16.600
The next level is analysis.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:19.600
So that's really trying to
understand the structure of

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.080
the material.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:28.240
So things like diagram,
differentiate, infer, outline,

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.270
point out, identify,
distinguish, discriminate, all

00:14:32.270 --> 00:14:35.365
those kinds of verbs com into
analysis kinds of questions.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:44.400
Synthesis--

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.640
so this is breaking
things apart.

00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.210
This is the ability
to put things back

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:51.600
together in new ways.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:51.840
OK?

00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:57.980
So design, explain, categorize,
create, revise,

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.915
rewrite, reorganize, devise.

00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:13.460
And the highest level
is evaluation.

00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:19.950
So judging the value of
material, for what purposes is

00:15:19.950 --> 00:15:23.450
this good versus that good?

00:15:23.450 --> 00:15:28.680
Explain, contrast, summarize,
support, recommend, evaluate,

00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.040
criticize, appraise,
so generally

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.170
quite high-level skills.

00:15:32.170 --> 00:15:37.410
So this is the taxonomy and
this is a higher level.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:42.780
OK, so a useful exercise--

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.330
whenever you're thinking of
problems-- is to try to place

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:46.630
them on this.

00:15:46.630 --> 00:15:51.550
Now it's not that you want
no-knowledge kind of questions

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.550
and you want only to ask these
kind of questions.

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:56.660
Because if you just ask these
kind of questions people will

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.730
not be ready for them.

00:15:57.730 --> 00:15:59.680
And they're not prepared.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.320
It doesn't actually
teach anything.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.430
You want a mix of them.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:06.000
But generally speaking, what
happens to often, is that most

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.710
of the questions that happen
are usually in this zone,

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.540
maybe a few of those.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:15.850
And then only later in
people's careers do

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.080
they get over here.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:21.210
For example, in engineering
curricula you learn a ton and

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:26.390
ton of application, maybe
comprehension, Maxwell's

00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:29.290
equations, differentiation,
integration.

00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:30.940
Then we start to synthesize
stuff.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.760
You know, in your senior
year you do

00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.920
design and project classes.

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.730
But you don't have to wait
all the way until then.

00:16:37.730 --> 00:16:40.620
You can actually start putting
stuff in much earlier.

00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:42.270
And it doesn't have to
be an entire class.

00:16:42.270 --> 00:16:45.865
You can have tasks that are like
that in a short time, on

00:16:45.865 --> 00:16:49.072
a problem set in the middle
of lecture time.

00:16:49.072 --> 00:16:49.500
OK?

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.655
So questions about
Bloom's Taxonomy?

00:16:57.820 --> 00:17:03.400
OK, so what I'll do, is I'll
give you an example of

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:09.740
questions that in freshman
physics mechanics--

00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:11.800
on the topic of Newton's
laws--

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.839
that fit into each
of those levels.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.720
OK, so just to give you an
example, to make it concrete,

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.900
to see what those kinds
of questions are.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.170
And some of the categorizations
I'm going to

00:17:23.170 --> 00:17:24.839
give you are debatable.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:29.410
But the rough idea is that
they go from high to low.

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:39.760
So this is on the subject of
Newton's second and third law.

00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:43.950
So a knowledge question, state
Newton's second and third law.

00:17:48.570 --> 00:17:51.350
Newton's second law, state
Newton's third law, so you can

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:54.780
see, just because people can
state it doesn't mean they can

00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:56.050
actually do anything with it.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:59.660
That's why this is way up just
at the knowledge end.

00:17:59.660 --> 00:18:02.280
Computers are actually
really good at this.

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.510
Right?

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.300
You can look it up on Google.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.950
But your computer can tell you
what Newton's second and third

00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.480
law are but you can't actually
do anything with them.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:17.450
So comprehension--

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:30.600
so give an example of Newton's
Second Law, using Newton's

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.850
Second Law.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:41.530
OK, this next one is
an application.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:44.660
It turns out to be, actually,
quite a hard application.

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:45.910
But it's still an application.

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:57.310
So it's to apply Newton's second
and third law to show

00:18:57.310 --> 00:19:03.640
the following, which the
following is suppose I have a

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:07.080
piece of chalk in my hand and
I stand on a weighing scale.

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:09.600
I want the students to show that
the weight that the scale

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.560
reads is equal to the sum of
the two individual weights.

00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.360
So I weigh myself.

00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.930
And then I put the chalk
on the scale.

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.150
And I add up those
two weights.

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:18.780
And that should be the
same as when I hold

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:20.290
the chalk in my hand.

00:19:20.290 --> 00:19:20.530
OK?

00:19:20.530 --> 00:19:23.035
So I'll diagram that as--

00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:45.160
OK, so that's me plus chalk
equals me plus chalk.

00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.410
So this is a scale.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:49.300
OK?

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:50.970
So there is the piece
of chalk.

00:19:50.970 --> 00:19:57.060
So now this is an example of
where that's quite a hard

00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:00.100
application question, even
though it's kind of high up on

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.590
the Bloom's list, so towards
the lower end.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.680
Because this is a serious
misconception

00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:06.710
that students have.

00:20:06.710 --> 00:20:09.110
Newton's second and Newton's
third law, people are

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.390
completely confused about,
you'll find.

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:15.250
They don't know when
to use which.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:18.890
And they think any time two
forces are equal it's sort of

00:20:18.890 --> 00:20:21.150
50-50, whether it's because of
Newton's third law or Newton's

00:20:21.150 --> 00:20:22.790
second law.

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:25.210
So this-- if you're addressing
misconceptions--

00:20:25.210 --> 00:20:28.320
makes the problem, actually,
all the much harder.

00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:35.060
So at analysis--

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.040
so the analysis comes out--
oh, question sorry.

00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.381
AUDIENCE: What are Newton's
second and third laws?

00:20:38.381 --> 00:20:39.950
PROFESSOR: Ah, fair question.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:52.120
So Newton's Second Law says
force equals mass times

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.530
acceleration.

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:57.140
Third law is--

00:20:57.140 --> 00:21:00.010
the way it's usually stated,
which it's terrible--

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.870
action equals reaction.

00:21:07.870 --> 00:21:11.840
Or for every action there's an
equal and opposite reaction.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.690
Oh, which reminds me, one of
the questions from before,

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:15.660
which is what name
would I give?

00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.560
Because I said I slagged off the
reaction force as the name

00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.970
and the normal force
as a name.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:21.800
People ask me, what should
you call it?

00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:23.230
And I actually thought
about that.

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:25.970
And I think the answer
is contact force.

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:27.260
Because that tells you
what the thing is.

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.340
It's a force of contact.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.160
So Newton's third law says
action equals reaction.

00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:36.510
So now, the problem is that
students have, is that

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:39.840
whenever they see two forces
are equal they assume it's

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.410
because the action
equals reaction.

00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:47.730
Or they think Newton's third
law is the reason for it.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:53.450
So for example, the
bouncing-ball question that we

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:55.100
talked about last time.

00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.320
So in the bouncing ball the
question is, when it's

00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.480
stationary on the ground what
are the forces on it?

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:02.550
And they'll often say, well,
there's a weight downwards.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:04.560
And there's the force upwards.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.640
And they'll often say, well, the
force upwards equals the

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.330
weight downwards.

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:09.800
These are both forces
on the ball because

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.190
action equals reaction.

00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:15.310
And they won't realize that
action and reaction have to be

00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:17.860
on different objects.

00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:18.130
OK?

00:22:18.130 --> 00:22:21.920
So they're fundamentally
confused about the meaning of

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.450
action and reaction, which you
can bring out with the

00:22:24.450 --> 00:22:25.700
following analysis question--

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:36.740
When two forces are equal in
magnitude how do you tell if

00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.440
it's Newton's two
or Newton three?

00:22:41.570 --> 00:22:43.570
So how do you know if it's
Newton two or Newton three?

00:22:43.570 --> 00:22:45.400
So just ask them that.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.172
Yes, question?

00:22:47.172 --> 00:22:50.148
AUDIENCE: This might be a little
bit off subject, but

00:22:50.148 --> 00:22:54.612
should we use Newton's
third law ever?

00:22:54.612 --> 00:22:57.588
It seems like it's a natural
consequence from

00:22:57.588 --> 00:22:59.100
saying a equals 0.

00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.190
PROFESSOR: Ah, oh,
OK, interesting.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.930
So OK, let me actually
explain that one.

00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:07.020
I'll put it over there because
I didn't do the

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:09.460
boards right over here.

00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:13.580
So that is exactly the issue
brought out by this question.

00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:14.925
And let me show you
the difference.

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:20.830
And then there was
another question.

00:23:20.830 --> 00:23:22.780
That reminds me of another whole
set of questions from

00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.540
the sheets, which was
how do you develop

00:23:26.540 --> 00:23:29.440
your physics intuition?

00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:31.810
So let me answer that
in a moment.

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:33.820
After this and then we'll
have a break.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.975
OK, so the bouncing-ball
question--

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.990
actually let's not do
the bouncing ball.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:48.630
Let's just do an object
sitting on the ground.

00:23:52.446 --> 00:23:56.000
Oh, great, can you
pass them around?

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:04.060
Oh, Leeann's just coming around
with a handout on

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:05.413
Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:24:05.413 --> 00:24:08.900
And let's see, I'll do these
after the break.

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.140
OK, suppose you have this object
sitting on the ground

00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.920
and it has Mass m.

00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:14.990
OK, let's look at what
the forces on it are.

00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:18.580
Well, there's mg down--

00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:25.370
and actually, in this case, the
contact force, our normal

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.830
force is equal to mg.

00:24:28.830 --> 00:24:32.690
OK, so now the question is, are
these two equal because of

00:24:32.690 --> 00:24:34.490
Newton's Second Law or
Newton's third law?

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:36.430
That's what this
question asks.

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:37.760
So it's actually worth
understanding

00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.420
the difference here.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:45.560
So these guys are equal
because a equals 0.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:49.280
So this thing's just sitting
on the ground, a equals 0.

00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.810
So the net force is
0, so these two

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.780
forces have to cancel.

00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:59.230
OK, so that's Newton's
Second Law.

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.980
So then the question is, where
does Newton's Third Law show

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:11.990
up in this?

00:25:11.990 --> 00:25:14.970
Ah, Newton's Third Law
shows up here.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.690
Here is the Earth.

00:25:20.690 --> 00:25:23.090
And here is your object.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.966
Let's just separate them just so
you can see them separate,

00:25:25.966 --> 00:25:27.790
although this is sitting
on there.

00:25:27.790 --> 00:25:30.380
So this is mg.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:34.140
Well, this is the mg because
of gravity, right?

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:37.260
The earth gravity is attracted
to mass, m.

00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:40.500
Well, the mass is also attracted
to the earth.

00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.585
So what's the force on the
earth from the mass?

00:25:44.585 --> 00:25:45.507
AUDIENCE: mg.

00:25:45.507 --> 00:25:49.020
PROFESSOR: mg, it has to be.

00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:51.460
Now this mg equals that mg.

00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:56.500
Call this f2 and this is f1.

00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:02.970
So f1 equals f2 by Newton's
third law.

00:26:02.970 --> 00:26:05.730
So that's a fundamentally
different set of forces.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:08.480
So are equal and opposite.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.510
They're an action/reaction
pair.

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:13.650
So what Newton's third
law really says--

00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.070
when you understand it-- is that
all forces in the world

00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.120
come in pairs.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.430
So if you ever see one force
you have to hunt around for

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:22.520
his other half.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:24.530
And the other half
here is this.

00:26:24.530 --> 00:26:30.370
So actually, there's another
question you could use for

00:26:30.370 --> 00:26:32.480
Newton's third law.

00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.550
So I don't have it
on the list here.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:37.980
But I'll ask it right now, which
is suppose someone comes

00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:41.730
to you and proposes the
following gravitational law--

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:49.980
f gravity equals g m1 squared
m2 over r squared when the g

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.410
is the proper units.

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.230
So m1 squared times m2,
is that a legal

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.220
force law for gravity?

00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.200
No, because when you switch m1
and m2 as you're doing here--

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.110
you're switching the mass
and the earth--

00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:05.100
you actually change the force.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.500
So then this would violate
Newton's third law.

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.000
OK?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.510
So Newton's third law, it
actually is a constraint on

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:14.440
the laws of physics.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:16.920
It's actually conservation
of momentum.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.780
And for momentum to be conserved
you can't have any

00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:22.100
arbitrary law of physics
that you want.

00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:24.500
Does that help clarify that?

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:27.470
AUDIENCE: Come up with a better
set of taxonomy for

00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:30.597
describing it that doesn't lead
people-- it leads people

00:27:30.597 --> 00:27:31.066
into thinking about that.

00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:32.500
PROFESSOR: I know.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:32.960
I agree.

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.740
So I think the terms
are very important.

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:39.030
So that's why don't like this
form, action equals reaction.

00:27:39.030 --> 00:27:43.940
I actually would prefer it were
stated all forces come in

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:45.860
pairs that are equal
and opposite.

00:27:57.390 --> 00:28:00.580
Right, and language does
have a powerful effect.

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:00.935
Yes?

00:28:00.935 --> 00:28:03.820
AUDIENCE: The technical
[? route's ?] obvious, just in

00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.399
calling the novel force the
contact force, but that's not

00:28:06.399 --> 00:28:06.592
refined enough.

00:28:06.592 --> 00:28:09.327
Because both friction and
novel are contact force?

00:28:09.327 --> 00:28:09.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.850
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] constraint
force because it

00:28:12.850 --> 00:28:14.295
could constrain into
the [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:14.295 --> 00:28:16.580
PROFESSOR: Yeah, that's probably
a better name.

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:17.490
Yeah, I agree with you.

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:19.610
So the comment was that contact
force isn't quite

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:22.880
right because there's friction
force as well.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:24.340
And that's also a
contact force.

00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:26.170
And maybe a better name
is constraint force.

00:28:26.170 --> 00:28:27.460
I think that is a better name.

00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:37.740
OK, so let me finish this list
of two more examples of

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.820
Newton's Second and third law.

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.070
And then we'll have a break.

00:28:44.410 --> 00:28:45.660
OK, synthesis.

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:58.700
So creating a problem using
Newton's second and third law.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.700
So for example, this is
a problem like that.

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:02.520
But here I'm asking the students
to make one up.

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.970
And here is a very hard evaluate
question, which is

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:24.180
what, if any, are the limits of
validity of Newton's Second

00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:25.430
and third law?

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.450
So that's, actually, a very

00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:39.440
interesting historical question.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:41.710
Interesting historically because
Einstein thought about

00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:43.150
that question.

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:47.740
He wanted to know whether
Newtonian gravitation and

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.930
special relativity
were compatible.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:55.030
And basically, they can't be
because of Newton's third law.

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:58.380
Because gravity should propagate
with some speed, not

00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.230
the speed of light.

00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:02.970
So you can't actually conserve
momentum right away.

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.530
Suppose the sun does
something strange.

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:07.440
Well, it takes a while
for the earth to

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.900
actually respond to that.

00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:11.300
And it's in that intervening
time Newton's third law seems

00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:12.310
to be violated.

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:14.310
So Einstein thought very
carefully about that question

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.220
and came up with his theory
of gravitation.

00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:18.160
So this is quite a high-level
question.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:21.850
But it's to show the whole range
of things you can ask

00:30:21.850 --> 00:30:24.270
about the second and Newton's
third law as you

00:30:24.270 --> 00:30:25.760
climb Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:32.150
OK, so what we're going to do
in the second part is we're

00:30:32.150 --> 00:30:33.340
going to actually practice

00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.980
rewriting a couple of questions.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:38.820
And I'll show you a couple
more examples.

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.500
And seeing how we can make
questions worse and better,

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.750
because I find that's actually
quite a good way to get

00:30:44.750 --> 00:30:47.870
practice with designing
questions is taking good

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.250
questions, making them bad,
taking bad questions and

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:51.340
making them good.

00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:53.810
Both ways are useful.

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:56.620
OK, so we'll do that.

00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:04.110
Let's say it's 9:04,
9:10 let's say.

00:31:04.110 --> 00:31:05.670
So it's 904 on that clock.

00:31:05.670 --> 00:31:10.370
So see everyone, sorry it's
10:04 on that adjusted clock.

00:31:10.370 --> 00:31:14.840
So see everyone at
10:10 or 10:11.

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:18.160
And meanwhile, here are
the feedback sheets.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:21.430
So I'll just put a bunch
in the two back things.

00:31:21.430 --> 00:31:24.510
So when you come back
just grab those.

00:31:24.510 --> 00:31:31.990
OK, so I'll just answer a
couple questions which I

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.240
promised to answer.

00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:40.250
So the comment made by several
people about last week's

00:31:40.250 --> 00:31:45.800
examples, say, of the rock and
the rolling was that oh no,

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.890
that showed me that my
physics intuition is

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:53.270
quite off, and bummer.

00:31:53.270 --> 00:31:55.130
And so then if you're going to
teach it, how do you make

00:31:55.130 --> 00:31:58.650
sure, well, A, how do you learn
to think intuitively

00:31:58.650 --> 00:31:59.660
about these things?

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.290
And B, if you're going
to teach it

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:03.450
how do you make sure--

00:32:03.450 --> 00:32:04.510
related to that--

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:08.750
you actually have the intuition
before you teach it.

00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:09.750
There's two answers to that.

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:13.440
One is that it's very rare that
anyone ever achieved a

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:17.120
goal that they didn't
set out to do.

00:32:17.120 --> 00:32:18.470
And then just happened
upon it.

00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.120
So I would say that's true,
also, with developing

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.720
intuition in these areas.

00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:25.120
You have to make it your goal.

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.120
So it's not going to just
happen by chance.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.490
So then questions, OK, if
it is your goal how do

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:32.610
you go about it?

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:37.080
One way is anytime you do a
calculation, at the end of the

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.500
calculation ask yourself
this question.

00:32:49.170 --> 00:32:52.360
So John Wheeler-- who was
Feynman's adviser--

00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.380
he recommended the following
question, which I think is a

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:55.300
fantastic question.

00:32:55.300 --> 00:33:00.540
So the question is if you could
time travel back and

00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:04.120
talk to your earlier self what
one or two sentences would you

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:06.370
tell your earlier self before
they started solving the

00:33:06.370 --> 00:33:08.930
problem that would make
the problem just

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:10.600
sort of flow smoothly?

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.850
OK?

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:33.180
So what sentence would you tell
your earlier, pre-problem

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:34.160
solved self?

00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.910
So this is after you
solved the problem.

00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:47.340
So that forces you to give a
insightful summary of what you

00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:48.720
learned from the problem.

00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.370
So it forces you towards the
intuitive way of reasoning.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:52.880
And you'll find it's quite
hard at first.

00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.550
Because you don't have the
intuitive library.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.990
But at least it points you in
the direction to be going.

00:33:56.990 --> 00:33:57.800
OK, now what else?

00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:04.870
Well, in chemistry there's
various books that help

00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:05.830
develop intuition.

00:34:05.830 --> 00:34:07.450
They have all kinds of
intuitive reasoning

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:08.070
questions in them.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.870
And some are quite good.

00:34:09.870 --> 00:34:11.170
Some of the books
are quite good.

00:34:11.170 --> 00:34:15.190
So the one in chemistry that
I like is called Voyages in

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:16.440
Conceptual Chemistry.

00:34:33.449 --> 00:34:37.420
And in physics one of the ones
I like is called Thinking

00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.670
Physics by Epstein.

00:34:44.264 --> 00:34:45.820
I think Epstein's like that.

00:34:54.909 --> 00:34:59.810
So what that is, is that's
basically, one

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:00.800
question per page.

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:03.210
And it's multiple-choice
intuitive reasoning question.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:05.530
And they're about all kinds of
interesting physics, like why

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:07.900
do tea kettles whistle?

00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.420
If you shake bottle of soda
up, why does it explode?

00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:15.900
And so it's filled with really,
really fascinating

00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.660
puzzles and ways of thinking.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:18.950
And then with explanations.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:22.110
So just by thinking about them,
reading the explanation,

00:35:22.110 --> 00:35:24.730
trying to understand, OK, then
asking yourself Wheeler's

00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:27.650
question at the end of reading
the explanation, even if you

00:35:27.650 --> 00:35:30.250
didn't solve it, you can develop
a lot of intuition.

00:35:30.250 --> 00:35:34.820
I don't know a good one
for math or biology.

00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.150
And if anyone does, I definitely
appreciate any

00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:39.600
suggestions.

00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:39.990
OK?

00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:43.390
But there are resources
in some fields.

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:48.690
And the other is just whenever
you find paradoxes go after

00:35:48.690 --> 00:35:49.920
them and share them
with everyone.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:51.260
And ask everyone you know,do
you know any

00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:52.680
paradoxes I can work on?

00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:54.910
That'll also developed
intuition.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:58.800
OK, and then related to that,
one comment was I've noticed

00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.380
that teaching is the best
way of learning.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.400
How can you incorporate
that into a course?

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:04.420
So yeah, that's true.

00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.103
So sometimes you just have to
accept that the first time you

00:36:07.103 --> 00:36:10.600
teach the thing you're going
to be learning a lot.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.930
So that's fine.

00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:14.820
And the second time you teach
it, it'll be much better.

00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.890
So you'll actually develop a
lot of intuition the first

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:18.290
time you teach a course.

00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:21.370
So for example, I found when I
was a graduate student, I was

00:36:21.370 --> 00:36:25.270
a teaching assistant for Physics
1A at Caltech, which

00:36:25.270 --> 00:36:27.540
was like 801.

00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.300
And I found I had
a huge number of

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.130
misconceptions about tension.

00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:32.630
I just had no idea
what tension was.

00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:34.640
For example, I thought
tension was a force.

00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:37.520
And now that seems
ridiculous to me.

00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.570
And it doesn't seem ridiculous
to you that's because you're

00:36:39.570 --> 00:36:43.750
in exactly the same state I
was in before I was taught

00:36:43.750 --> 00:36:44.260
physics 1A.

00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:47.840
And I've got myself all in a
twist when I was trying to

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:48.670
explain it.

00:36:48.670 --> 00:36:52.020
And I finally tracked it down
to actually, that particular

00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:53.040
misconception.

00:36:53.040 --> 00:36:56.420
So then I developed a bunch of
questions for myself, which I

00:36:56.420 --> 00:36:58.490
also asked students
about tension.

00:36:58.490 --> 00:37:02.210
So teaching is learning.

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:04.410
And then how do you incorporate
that into a class

00:37:04.410 --> 00:37:05.300
for the students?

00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.890
Well, you can ask them to teach
each other and argue

00:37:07.890 --> 00:37:08.780
with each other.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.390
So we'll talk about that
in the session

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:11.720
on interactive teaching.

00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.900
But yeah, it is the best
way of learning.

00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:16.820
And so if you can get the
students to do that as well

00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:18.770
you'll be increasing
their learning.

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:24.330
And then the last question for
the moment was what's my

00:37:24.330 --> 00:37:26.530
response to the following
article-- so it was in the

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:29.910
globe on February 15, 2009.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:31.900
And it said, don't
open with a joke.

00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:36.530
So it was summarizing a paper
called "Increased

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:39.450
Interestingness of Extraneous
Details in a Multimedia

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:43.220
Science Presentation Leads to
Decreased Learning." Journal

00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:47.740
of Experimental Psychology,
December, 2008.

00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:49.000
So they summarized that.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.980
So basically, what they found
is that if you start with a

00:37:51.980 --> 00:37:55.210
joke that's extraneous to the
material it actually decreases

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:55.910
the learning.

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:58.810
And that, I think, is
quite plausible.

00:37:58.810 --> 00:38:02.030
So I recommend that you start
with something interesting in

00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.400
the beginning.

00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.590
But it should be related
to the material.

00:38:06.590 --> 00:38:08.040
So the problem wasn't
the joke.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:09.430
The problem was that
the joke wasn't

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:12.280
related to the material.

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.830
So the thing should
be interesting.

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:14.970
Because you want to
draw people in.

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:16.570
You don't want to conclude from
that article that you

00:38:16.570 --> 00:38:18.200
shouldn't start with
some interesting.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.570
But you should start with
something interesting that's

00:38:19.570 --> 00:38:22.000
related to the material.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.750
OK, so redesigning questions.

00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:33.540
So here is an actual question
that we will redesign.

00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:36.830
And I've left up the Bloom's
Taxonomy there.

00:38:40.050 --> 00:38:42.410
So actually, I have a
bunch of questions.

00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:44.090
We'll do a couple of them.

00:38:44.090 --> 00:38:46.480
And we'll review, probably, one
of the questions we did

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.440
earlier, which is
about the cones.

00:39:06.350 --> 00:39:09.680
OK, so the question to start
with-- and we're going to go

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.170
that way and that way--

00:39:11.170 --> 00:39:14.320
is find the eigenvalues
of this matrix.

00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.630
So for those whose linear
algebra is rusty, the

00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:30.720
eigenvalues of a matrix so
a matrix, m, times some

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:35.930
eigenvector e is equal
to lambda times e.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:40.050
So if there's some vector that
the matrix just brings back to

00:39:40.050 --> 00:39:42.885
itself with some constant,
that's the eigenvalue.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.685
And this is the eigenvector.

00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:57.000
So eigen meaning
own in German.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.790
So somehow this vector belongs
to the matrix.

00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:04.450
It's said to be an eigenvector
of the matrix.

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:08.340
It's preserved when you hit
it with the matrix.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:09.620
You get back the thing itself.

00:40:09.620 --> 00:40:11.975
And in that way it belongs
to the matrix.

00:40:11.975 --> 00:40:16.150
OK, so there are recipes
for computing it.

00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:18.940
And so here the question is, I'm
asking students to use the

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:22.050
recipe for computing
the eigenvalue.

00:40:22.050 --> 00:40:26.940
OK, so now I'm going to ask you
the following question,

00:40:26.940 --> 00:40:28.830
which is to design--

00:40:28.830 --> 00:40:34.860
well, first of all, where would
you say that guy goes?

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:38.020
It's sort of comprehension.

00:40:38.020 --> 00:40:40.970
You know, it's basically
computing.

00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:42.220
Maybe it's a bit
of application.

00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:45.420
But it's basically
comprehension.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:50.440
OK, so can we go lower on the
taxonomy towards knowledge?

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:56.610
Can we go higher towards the
higher-level reasoning?

00:40:56.610 --> 00:40:58.775
Let's try to construct questions
on this end.

00:41:09.090 --> 00:41:13.350
OK, so everyone understand
the thing to work out?

00:41:13.350 --> 00:41:16.570
I'm going to ask you to try to
think of stuff that could be

00:41:16.570 --> 00:41:17.590
put here and here.

00:41:17.590 --> 00:41:24.161
So this is lower level
and this is higher.

00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.820
Does anyone need
me to explain--

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.980
or want me to explain-- more
about eigenvalues or

00:41:34.980 --> 00:41:36.230
eigenvectors?

00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:42.580
OK, so find a neighbor or two.

00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:44.330
And try to think of stuff
that can go in

00:41:44.330 --> 00:41:48.840
this box or this box.

00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:52.020
And generally, the higher-level
questions

00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:57.740
requires more knowledge about
the material, which is one

00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:59.580
aspect of their being
higher level.

00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:01.620
You need a bigger margin of
safety when you're trying to

00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:02.560
design them.

00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.770
But don't let that bother you.

00:42:03.770 --> 00:42:05.040
See what you can construct.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.590
And you can use the levels on
Bloom's Taxonomy to try to

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.540
create some kind of questions
around it.

00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:26.110
By the way, the answer to this
question, by the way, is i and

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.465
minus i, just in case
you are curious.

00:42:33.930 --> 00:42:43.920
OK, so let's see what examples
you've come up with, so

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:45.280
related to this question.

00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:49.280
Obviously, you'll change
it around some.

00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:52.840
Let's say either side, this
side or this side.

00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:54.720
Someone I haven't heard from?

00:42:54.720 --> 00:42:55.950
Yes, can you tell
me your name?

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:56.880
AUDIENCE: Mike.

00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.470
PROFESSOR: Mike, yeah?

00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:58.655
AUDIENCE: What is
an eigenvalue?

00:42:58.655 --> 00:43:00.430
PROFESSOR: OK, so what
is an eigenvalue?

00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:02.010
Where would you put that?

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:04.460
AUDIENCE: Lower.

00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:05.710
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.380
PROFESSOR: Oh, yeah,
good question.

00:43:09.380 --> 00:43:11.590
It depends where you
put this one.

00:43:11.590 --> 00:43:18.140
This one is computing, which I
roughly put that somewhere

00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:21.870
between comprehension
and application.

00:43:21.870 --> 00:43:29.790
So right now I would say, we're
somewhere around there.

00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:33.270
So your question is to
define eigenvalue?

00:43:33.270 --> 00:43:34.520
OK.

00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.810
I'm just short-handing
it as defined lambda.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:43.430
OK, so that's one question.

00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:44.760
OK, another question.

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.750
Can you tell me your name?

00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:46.040
AUDIENCE: Wendy.

00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:46.480
PROFESSOR: Wendy, yes?

00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:49.875
AUDIENCE: So related to that,
is that you could put that

00:43:49.875 --> 00:43:51.339
question higher.

00:43:51.339 --> 00:43:54.884
If you asked them, what does
an eigenvalue mean?

00:43:54.884 --> 00:43:59.163
If you word it differently
instead of [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:59.163 --> 00:44:03.030
PROFESSOR: OK, which may have
been what you meant as well

00:44:03.030 --> 00:44:07.680
and I may have defined lambda.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:10.500
OK, so you're saying, well, you
can actually ask them to

00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.120
say, what does eigenvalue
mean?

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:22.870
OK, so how would you if they
know what it means?

00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:25.810
So what would you look for
in something like that?

00:44:25.810 --> 00:44:30.013
AUDIENCE: If they could describe
it to you, or maybe

00:44:30.013 --> 00:44:34.070
tell you a problem in which it'd
be useful, in using it?

00:44:34.070 --> 00:44:36.650
PROFESSOR: OK, so yeah,
let me write that too.

00:44:36.650 --> 00:44:51.700
Create a problem that would
benefit from lambda, that

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:52.950
would need lambda.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:58.010
OK, so for example
here, create.

00:44:58.010 --> 00:45:01.430
That's gone pretty far down
towards synthesis.

00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:04.970
I really should have flipped
the list around.

00:45:04.970 --> 00:45:10.350
But synthesis is quite high
on Bloom's taxonomy.

00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:12.020
So you're actually going
to create a problem.

00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:16.060
It's like the Newton's
law example.

00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:16.846
Yes?

00:45:16.846 --> 00:45:18.236
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:45:18.236 --> 00:45:20.228
instead of saying, again,
what does lambda mean?

00:45:20.228 --> 00:45:24.212
You could say what do the
results from finding lambda?

00:45:24.212 --> 00:45:26.210
What are the results
of that solution?

00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:29.370
PROFESSOR: OK, so how does
it help you to know the

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:30.010
eigenvalues?

00:45:30.010 --> 00:45:31.333
Is that the question?

00:45:31.333 --> 00:45:34.714
AUDIENCE: No, I'm just saying
instead of the general asking

00:45:34.714 --> 00:45:37.129
for the definition, what
does lambda mean?

00:45:37.129 --> 00:45:38.578
What is an eigenvalue?

00:45:38.578 --> 00:45:40.030
What does it mean?

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:42.510
But after having solved the
problem saying, what does your

00:45:42.510 --> 00:45:42.800
answer mean?

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:46.260
PROFESSOR: Ah, OK, so even if
you ask them this first you

00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:49.070
can say, OK, interpret
your answer.

00:45:49.070 --> 00:45:50.650
Yeah, and that's
a-- generally--

00:45:50.650 --> 00:45:51.570
very good policy.

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:52.820
So interpret.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:00.010
and where would I put that?

00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.400
Eh, interpret is somewhere
like analysis,

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.610
maybe a bit of synthesis.

00:46:03.610 --> 00:46:05.860
But yeah, it's quite
high on the list.

00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:09.770
So interpret, that's another
really key word.

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.930
In fact, it's often
neglected, right?

00:46:11.930 --> 00:46:14.450
We just ask students to
solve the problem.

00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:15.940
And wander, wander, wander.

00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:18.260
They get the thing that
looks like an answer.

00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:20.750
They put a box around
it and they're done.

00:46:20.750 --> 00:46:24.150
But actually, you can massively
increase the level

00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:26.420
of a problem just by adding
to the problem,

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.700
interpret your answer.

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.520
What does it mean, that
that's an eigenvalue?

00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:33.140
And maybe they would say
something like this.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:37.690
But even that would be better
than just having done the

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:39.920
computational procedure and
got an answer out of it.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:44.120
Yes, can you tell
me your name?

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:44.745
AUDIENCE: Ben.

00:46:44.745 --> 00:46:45.700
PROFESSOR: Ben, yes?

00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:49.095
AUDIENCE: I might ask, does
that matrix have any

00:46:49.095 --> 00:46:49.580
eigenvalues?

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.625
PROFESSOR: OK, so yeah, so
let's put it over here.

00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:07.080
Right, so there what you're
doing is you're not presuming.

00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:10.430
You're not key-wording
what they should do.

00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:13.120
When you do this-- especially
if it's a

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:14.680
linear algebra course--

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:16.700
they've probably seen a bunch
of things like this.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.280
Like in a calculus
course, integrate

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.600
these things by parts.

00:47:19.600 --> 00:47:23.040
They just know I have to
integrate by parts, whereas

00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.590
here you're at least
one step higher.

00:47:25.590 --> 00:47:27.260
Because they don't know whether
there's an answer to

00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.110
the problem or not.

00:47:28.110 --> 00:47:29.990
And they have to think, well,
how do I know if they're

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.550
eigenvalues?

00:47:30.550 --> 00:47:33.800
So there's actually one
intervening level of

00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:36.420
sophistication.

00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:37.470
Other suggestions?

00:47:37.470 --> 00:47:38.763
Yes, Adrian?

00:47:38.763 --> 00:47:43.615
AUDIENCE: Just give them two
numbers and say write a matrix

00:47:43.615 --> 00:47:45.465
that has these as
the eigenvalues?

00:47:45.465 --> 00:47:49.855
PROFESSOR: OK, so let me
continue the list over here.

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:06.800
OK, so create a matrix which has
the following eigenvalues.

00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:21.410
So say lambda equals
2 comma 3.

00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:27.390
So create a matrix,
create a meaning.

00:48:27.390 --> 00:48:31.200
We're already high up in the
taxonomy toward synthesis.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.640
And actually, I would even use
a related one, which is--

00:48:48.260 --> 00:48:52.990
so create a real matrix with
eigenvalues i comma minus i.

00:48:52.990 --> 00:48:55.170
So that one, is quite
related to this.

00:48:55.170 --> 00:48:59.190
And this is the answer.

00:48:59.190 --> 00:49:02.910
So it's quite a hard question.

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:08.240
Even if people can do this and
find i comma minus i, this one

00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:12.190
is very hard because you're
asking to apply a constraint

00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.170
that the thing be real.

00:49:14.170 --> 00:49:15.630
So it's not just any matrix.

00:49:15.630 --> 00:49:16.830
But it's that the
thing be real.

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:18.580
And then you have to really
understand quite a lot about

00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.180
matrices to do that.

00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:22.110
Yes, can you tell
me your name?

00:49:22.110 --> 00:49:22.830
AUDIENCE: Scott.

00:49:22.830 --> 00:49:23.230
PROFESSOR: Scott.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:26.436
AUDIENCE: So, I was thinking of
a synthesis question which

00:49:26.436 --> 00:49:31.380
would be is after multiplying
the item the eigenvector by

00:49:31.380 --> 00:49:34.352
the matrix how is it rotated?

00:49:34.352 --> 00:49:39.460
PROFESSOR: OK, so what is the
geometric effect on the

00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:42.892
eigenvector of the matrix
on the eigenvector?

00:49:42.892 --> 00:49:45.181
AUDIENCE: Right, but the
question is if they understand

00:49:45.181 --> 00:49:46.635
what an eigenvalue is.

00:49:46.635 --> 00:49:51.090
PROFESSOR: They should be able
to answer that right away.

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.370
Right, but it really tests for
understanding of what the

00:49:53.370 --> 00:49:53.800
meaning is.

00:49:53.800 --> 00:49:57.720
So it's another way of
approaching the question of do

00:49:57.720 --> 00:49:59.185
they understand eigenvalue
means?

00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.040
What is the geometric effect
of the matrix on the

00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.860
eigenvector?

00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:21.960
And then hopefully, they'll be
able to say well, actually, it

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:22.740
doesn't rotate it.

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:23.690
It just scales it.

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:27.740
And the eigenvalue is the
amount of scaling.

00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:30.640
OK, and that demonstrates
quite a high level of

00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:31.850
understanding too.

00:50:31.850 --> 00:50:35.200
And This is one reason that
oral exams, generally, are

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:36.830
quite good ways of evaluating.

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:38.380
Because you can ask these
kind of questions.

00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:41.430
And as soon as you see that they
understand you move on to

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:42.610
something else.

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:45.330
Which of the flip side is that's
why oral exams are very

00:50:45.330 --> 00:50:46.990
disconcerting for
the students.

00:50:46.990 --> 00:50:50.100
Because you spend no time on
the things they understand.

00:50:50.100 --> 00:50:50.600
Right?

00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.510
So as soon as you know they
understand it, you move on to

00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:53.210
something else.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:54.500
So the student just feels
like, what the

00:50:54.500 --> 00:50:55.930
hell happened to me?

00:50:55.930 --> 00:50:56.820
I was doing fine.

00:50:56.820 --> 00:50:58.230
And they asked me about
something else.

00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:59.090
Yeah, that's exactly right.

00:50:59.090 --> 00:51:01.000
That's why they asked you
about something else.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.920
They knew there was nothing
more here to find out.

00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.040
You understood it.

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.720
But that's why oral exams
are such a good way-- so

00:51:07.720 --> 00:51:08.480
efficient--

00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:09.730
for evaluating.

00:51:12.370 --> 00:51:17.810
So in Cambridge we used to do
oral exam interviews for

00:51:17.810 --> 00:51:19.730
admission for undergraduate.

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:22.280
So people would be admitted
to the major right away.

00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.720
So we had two 20-minute
interviews.

00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:27.780
And we found those were much
more reliable than all the

00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:30.440
exams that they did in
high school, the

00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.010
equivalent of AP exams.

00:51:32.010 --> 00:51:34.200
Because you could really ask
questions that really probed

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:37.330
understanding and right away see
what people could do and

00:51:37.330 --> 00:51:39.760
couldn't do.

00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:43.750
So geometric effective of m on e
creating a matrix, so you're

00:51:43.750 --> 00:51:46.650
asking, so what's the
geometric effect?

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:48.000
It's not just comprehension.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:51.507
You're asking them to apply
it and maybe, in a

00:51:51.507 --> 00:51:53.170
bit in a new area.

00:51:53.170 --> 00:51:55.690
They hadn't really thought of
eigenvalues and eigenvectors

00:51:55.690 --> 00:51:56.675
as geometric at all.

00:51:56.675 --> 00:51:58.320
And now, all of sudden, you're
asking them that.

00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:00.700
You're asking them to transfer
their knowledge, which is one

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:04.230
of the fundamental goals.

00:52:04.230 --> 00:52:04.615
Yes?

00:52:04.615 --> 00:52:06.157
AUDIENCE: Once you give them two
matrices that has the same

00:52:06.157 --> 00:52:09.660
eigenvalues you can ask them
to see if they are

00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:11.560
related in some ways.

00:52:20.648 --> 00:52:23.630
PROFESSOR: Right, so for
example, let's do this one.

00:52:23.630 --> 00:52:39.870
So how are those two
matrices related?

00:52:39.870 --> 00:52:42.700
So they both have eigenvalues
i and minus i.

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:46.190
This one obviously does because
those are the diagonal

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:47.720
values and there's
nothing else.

00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:51.290
And this one, you have to do
it by the magic procedure.

00:52:51.290 --> 00:52:52.190
You don't have to.

00:52:52.190 --> 00:52:55.160
And so how are they related?

00:52:55.160 --> 00:53:01.820
So that is some kind of
analysis question.

00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:03.860
And it's quite a difficult
analysis question.

00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:06.560
It tests for really, do they
understand what matrices mean?

00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:09.290
So that's why I've underlined
this word.

00:53:09.290 --> 00:53:14.220
The questions all in this column
are all somehow testing

00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.570
that they understand
what things mean.

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:20.250
So that ties back to the point
I made earlier, which is that

00:53:20.250 --> 00:53:23.780
the whole fundamental point of
asking good questions is to

00:53:23.780 --> 00:53:25.830
avoid rote learning.

00:53:25.830 --> 00:53:27.950
Is that by asking good
questions you're

00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:29.000
fighting rote learning.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.970
And rote learning is the
bane of most education.

00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:33.210
Right?

00:53:33.210 --> 00:53:38.970
Rote learning is too often
the result of education.

00:53:38.970 --> 00:53:40.570
And it's the-- in my view--

00:53:40.570 --> 00:53:42.500
fundamental problem
with education.

00:53:42.500 --> 00:53:45.190
So by asking questions that are
different you're actually

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:47.180
starting to fight that
and break the habit.

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.380
So for example, how does
rote learning show up?

00:53:49.380 --> 00:53:56.800
Well, in the bouncing-ball
question, so the force is-- in

00:53:56.800 --> 00:53:57.510
the instant that it's

00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:59.390
stationary, while it's bouncing--

00:53:59.390 --> 00:54:00.640
people say mg.

00:54:05.337 --> 00:54:06.810
While this mg is right.

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:09.830
The gravity, but the contact--

00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:11.830
let's say the constraint
force--

00:54:11.830 --> 00:54:15.030
in this case it is a very
full-contact force is mg.

00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:19.940
One of the reasons they say that
is the misconception that

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:23.220
they think a equals 0
because v equals 0.

00:54:23.220 --> 00:54:25.620
So that's one reason.

00:54:25.620 --> 00:54:28.010
But the other reason is that
they've done so many problems

00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:33.020
with books resting on tables,
balls resting on tables, where

00:54:33.020 --> 00:54:34.810
the force is mg.

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:35.010
Right?

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:38.090
So they've now induced a new
rule of physics, let's call it

00:54:38.090 --> 00:54:40.390
Newton's fourth law.

00:54:40.390 --> 00:54:46.020
That anytime you see a contact
force it is mg.

00:54:46.020 --> 00:54:51.690
So contact force equals mg maybe
times cosine of theta.

00:54:51.690 --> 00:54:52.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:52.610 --> 00:54:53.340
PROFESSOR: Right?

00:54:53.340 --> 00:54:54.080
or sine theta.

00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:57.480
I guess it's mg--

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:58.820
well, it depends how
you measure theta.

00:54:58.820 --> 00:55:00.500
But theta is the tilt
of the plane.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:03.440
So if the plane is tilted 0
degrees just to ground, well

00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:06.050
it's then mg.

00:55:06.050 --> 00:55:10.140
So that kind of learning is the
result of rote learning

00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:12.660
because they've solved problems
without understanding

00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:13.650
what they mean.

00:55:13.650 --> 00:55:16.520
So instead of figuring out that
oh, actually, you could

00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:18.990
understand it from Newton's
Second Law and understanding

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:22.400
acceleration, they think oh,
there's a new pattern here.

00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:22.700
Right?

00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:25.630
Oh, a new pattern is whenever
I see contact forces it's mg

00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:27.520
times maybe cos theta
or sine theta.

00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:27.850
Yes?

00:55:27.850 --> 00:55:29.760
AUDIENCE: What's the exact
question with that system and

00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.850
what's the normal [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:31.850 --> 00:55:35.490
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so the question
was so you drop the

00:55:35.490 --> 00:55:36.730
ball, say from here.

00:55:36.730 --> 00:55:38.870
And when it bounces off the
steel table there's one

00:55:38.870 --> 00:55:41.480
instant when it's stationary
on steel table.

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.276
And what are the forces
on it at that instant?

00:55:45.276 --> 00:55:47.530
AUDIENCE: I remember
from last week.

00:55:47.530 --> 00:55:48.780
PROFESSOR: Yeah, no,
fair enough.

00:55:48.780 --> 00:55:50.590
I should have stated the
question out again.

00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:54.569
So this is stationary
for an instant.

00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:08.650
All right, so actually the ball
is quite compressed here.

00:56:08.650 --> 00:56:09.138
Yes?

00:56:09.138 --> 00:56:12.879
AUDIENCE: Isn't it impossible
to give an exact answer for

00:56:12.879 --> 00:56:16.458
the force with the [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:16.458 --> 00:56:19.890
if you don't have
the duration?

00:56:19.890 --> 00:56:21.990
PROFESSOR: It is, right.

00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:24.900
So it is impossible to give
the exact answer.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:28.340
But what you ask them is, well,
how big is it roughly?

00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:30.750
So I always protect myself
by saying roughly.

00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:33.220
And then you can ask
anything you want.

00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:38.020
And because, really, all I'm
interested in is do they think

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.590
it's 1 times mg or do
they realize it's 10

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:42.020
to the 4 times mg?

00:56:42.020 --> 00:56:45.410
And those are so far apart
that I don't care about

00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:48.230
factors of two or three
or even 10.

00:56:48.230 --> 00:56:51.140
Now, how can you know that it's
10 to the 4 times mg?

00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:54.070
Well, that is quite
a hard question.

00:56:54.070 --> 00:56:55.790
That's way down there.

00:56:55.790 --> 00:56:59.880
Even though you'll see some
lists of Bloom's Taxonomy say

00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:04.120
estimate is a low-level
skill, not that

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.190
high in Bloom's Taxonomy.

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.570
It's almost like computing
somewhere in comprehension.

00:57:07.570 --> 00:57:08.830
I don't agree with that.

00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:12.430
Because as you saw from the
example where students

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:16.240
couldn't estimate 3.04 times
5.3, they're terrible at

00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.680
estimation.

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.660
So estimation actually hits one
of the big misconceptions

00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:24.240
and reveals a lot of
the misconceptions.

00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.190
So I put estimation almost at
the level of synthesis because

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:30.740
it forces you to really
synthesize your understanding.

00:57:30.740 --> 00:57:32.070
You can't hide behind
formulas.

00:57:32.070 --> 00:57:35.860
So the next thing I'll do is
say, OK, let's estimate this

00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:36.990
and see if you can do that.

00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:38.670
And if they really understand
the system they

00:57:38.670 --> 00:57:39.390
can estimate it.

00:57:39.390 --> 00:57:40.280
But it's quite hard.

00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:42.710
And I find almost no students
can do it on their own.

00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:46.060
But the method of estimation is,
as you say, you do need to

00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:49.490
know the contact time.

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:55.930
So the acceleration is
not 0 as you say.

00:57:55.930 --> 00:58:00.340
But it's delta v over delta
t, where delta t

00:58:00.340 --> 00:58:03.050
is the contact time.

00:58:03.050 --> 00:58:05.475
Well, it's going v and then it's
pretty much going v up,

00:58:05.475 --> 00:58:07.340
so that's about 2v.

00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.080
But I don't care about
factors of 2.

00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:13.150
And then, what's the
contact time?

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:16.860
Well, there's a couple methods
for doing the contact time.

00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:20.030
One is you listen
for the pitch.

00:58:20.030 --> 00:58:23.480
And whatever the highest
frequency in the pitch is--

00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:26.540
suppose it's 10 to
the 4 hertz--

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:29.420
well, then 1 over that time,
1 over the frequency

00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:30.730
is roughly a time.

00:58:30.730 --> 00:58:33.170
So it's probably the
contact time.

00:58:33.170 --> 00:58:34.520
So that's one approach.

00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:36.860
The other approach is to say
well, actually, physically

00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:39.170
what's happening?

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:42.260
The ball is hitting
the bottom.

00:58:42.260 --> 00:58:45.260
And this end compressing.

00:58:45.260 --> 00:58:46.310
But this end keeps going.

00:58:46.310 --> 00:58:49.690
Because it has no knowledge that
the bottom of the ball

00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:50.740
hit the ground.

00:58:50.740 --> 00:58:52.290
How's it going to
know about that?

00:58:52.290 --> 00:58:54.110
Well, the bottom of the
ball has to tell it.

00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:55.130
How's it going to tell it?

00:58:55.130 --> 00:58:56.210
Well, it has to send some
kind of signal.

00:58:56.210 --> 00:58:57.270
How does it send signal?

00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:58.130
Sound.

00:58:58.130 --> 00:59:06.170
So it sends a sound
wave upward.

00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.980
And the sound wave travels in
steel about 5 or 10 kilometers

00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:11.070
per second.

00:59:11.070 --> 00:59:14.270
So you suppose it's a
5-centimeter ball, then it's

00:59:14.270 --> 00:59:17.260
about 10 to the minus 5 seconds
is your contact time.

00:59:17.260 --> 00:59:18.510
So this is really short.

00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:28.640
So suppose v is something like a
meter per second, and divide

00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:30.440
it by 10 to the 5 seconds.

00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:32.700
You're talking about something
like 10 to the 5 meters per

00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:37.915
second squared, which is 10 to
the 4 times the acceleration

00:59:37.915 --> 00:59:40.040
due to gravity.

00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:40.430
OK?

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:45.960
So I went through because I
think it's interesting but

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:49.160
also to show that estimating
actually requires generally,

00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.180
very high-level skills.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.090
And it's quite hard
for the students.

00:59:52.090 --> 00:59:53.540
Therefore you should do it.

00:59:53.540 --> 00:59:55.530
So there are some people who
say, well, it's very hard for

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:56.000
the students.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.420
Don't do it.

00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:59.690
But again, there's another rule
of thumb in teaching,

00:59:59.690 --> 01:00:02.330
which is nobody ever learned
anything that you didn't

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:03.465
actually try to help
them with.

01:00:03.465 --> 01:00:04.440
Well, that's not quite true.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:06.490
But if you never teach something
they're not very

01:00:06.490 --> 01:00:07.400
likely to learn it.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.900
So if it's something hard but
valuable you have to start

01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:14.520
teaching at some point,
which is why I put

01:00:14.520 --> 01:00:15.585
up that graph earlier.

01:00:15.585 --> 01:00:16.790
Oh, it's gone now.

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:20.120
Where in the earlier stages of
teaching you do things more

01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.050
approximately.

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:25.340
And then in the later stages
you do it more exactly.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:28.380
So what I've told you
now is a slight lie.

01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.960
So this brings up the
question from last

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.960
time, what about lying?

01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:32.530
Is it useful?

01:00:32.530 --> 01:00:36.210
Yes, it's essential because this
argument is simple enough

01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:37.430
that once you understand
it you can just

01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:38.870
keep it in your head.

01:00:38.870 --> 01:00:43.150
And it's a bit of a lie, the
reason being that the ball

01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:45.360
doesn't have a uniform
cross section.

01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:49.130
So as the ball compresses the
contact area changes, whereas

01:00:49.130 --> 01:00:52.900
if the ball were cube or a rod
the contact area would stay

01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:54.140
the same as it compressed.

01:00:54.140 --> 01:00:57.210
So there's a correction
factor because the

01:00:57.210 --> 01:00:58.840
contact area changes.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:01.700
Now, that correction factor
is not very big.

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:03.920
It turns out to be the
fifth root of some

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.420
dimensionless thing.

01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:09.640
And so this sound-wave argument
you put in to the 4/5

01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.070
power and then you put in the
other thing to the 1/5 power.

01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:14.970
So it's almost correct for
this spherical ball.

01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:17.560
So in a later of course
it actually

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.360
adjusts for that factor.

01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:21.370
And then in a much later course,
probably, what I would

01:01:21.370 --> 01:01:26.040
do is calculate the exact 2 pi
over whatever factor that

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:31.600
shows up as well, by way of
increasing the symbolic

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:32.730
complexity.

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:37.760
But even this estimate, doing
that is conceptually hard.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:41.040
So I would say start
that early.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.520
AUDIENCE: I think the point
I was trying to

01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:45.260
make was that this--

01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.350
I suspect that the students
answered that wrong because of

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:52.682
real problem solving, and that
they expect there to be a

01:01:52.682 --> 01:01:57.080
solution given the data
that you [INAUDIBLE].

01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.160
PROFESSOR: Well, if you've
worked with them a bit on

01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:02.280
estimating they know that
they're going to have to do

01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:02.970
some thinking.

01:02:02.970 --> 01:02:07.530
If you say compute the force
I agree with you for sure.

01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:09.760
They're going to think they have
to be able to do it from

01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:10.410
the data there.

01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:12.555
And they'll just say it's got
to be mg because that's the

01:02:12.555 --> 01:02:13.420
only other force I know.

01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:17.550
But if you say estimate then
there is a bit of a queue that

01:02:17.550 --> 01:02:20.080
they have to include some other
information which might

01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:21.350
not put in the problem.

01:02:21.350 --> 01:02:22.820
And so that mitigates
the rote learning.

01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:25.670
But what I find, even then, is
they usually still can't do it

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:29.270
because their misconceptions
about acceleration are so deep

01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:30.750
and about equilibrium
and force.

01:02:30.750 --> 01:02:32.255
They think f equals
mv, basically.

01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:43.630
OK, so let's just look at
what we've done here.

01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:46.970
So I would say you can
define lambda.

01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:49.260
You can define eigenvector.

01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:52.970
You can even say state the
computational procedure.

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:56.640
I'm not sure where
I would put that.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:03:00.360
Depending on how people learn
it, this could be purely a

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.610
knowledge question.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.960
Because people could state the
procedure but not really

01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.930
understand it, not be
able to do anything.

01:03:12.930 --> 01:03:16.410
Or actually, you could say
program the procedure.

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:18.530
Well, that would be something
over here probably.

01:03:18.530 --> 01:03:20.400
Because to program it you
probably have to understand

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.130
what you're doing pretty well.

01:03:22.130 --> 01:03:25.480
So stating the procedure, it
depends how you ask them to

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:27.250
state it, whether it's
a low-level or

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:28.140
a high-level question.

01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:30.806
So I'll put program over here.

01:03:47.570 --> 01:03:51.120
OK, so we've gone down and up.

01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:54.340
And again, I want to remind you,
I'm not saying all your

01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.940
questions need to be here.

01:03:55.940 --> 01:04:01.380
But generally, the questions are
too much over here and not

01:04:01.380 --> 01:04:02.470
enough over here.

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:05.530
So this gives you a recipe for
thinking of new questions.

01:04:05.530 --> 01:04:05.820
Yes?

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:08.774
AUDIENCE: So throughout the
course do you basically, maybe

01:04:08.774 --> 01:04:12.260
start on the first three in
the beginning and then you

01:04:12.260 --> 01:04:15.248
move it more through until you
reach the end of the course?

01:04:15.248 --> 01:04:17.670
PROFESSOR: More fractal.

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:21.030
The question was as the course
moves on do you move more

01:04:21.030 --> 01:04:22.340
towards synthesis?

01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:24.230
I actually try to
make it fractal.

01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:29.330
So within each unit and each day
even, I try to maybe have

01:04:29.330 --> 01:04:31.850
something, knowledge or
comprehension just to make

01:04:31.850 --> 01:04:33.270
sure everyone's tracking.

01:04:33.270 --> 01:04:36.910
But try to have something
interesting as

01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:37.860
well, all the time.

01:04:37.860 --> 01:04:41.690
So something synthesis,
analysis, maybe some evaluate.

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:43.920
And so each problem set--
for example--

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:46.530
I'll put, generally,
warm-up questions.

01:04:46.530 --> 01:04:50.460
So basically they're marked warm
up so that people know

01:04:50.460 --> 01:04:53.000
OK, those are going to be
knowledge and comprehension.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:53.940
And you need that.

01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:56.290
Because otherwise there's no
point trying to do synthesis

01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:58.060
if you don't have the
base knowledge.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.930
But just make sure you
understand those,

01:04:59.930 --> 01:05:01.310
just in your sleep.

01:05:01.310 --> 01:05:04.210
And then regular problems, which
tend to be somewhere in

01:05:04.210 --> 01:05:07.750
the middle, say application
or analysis.

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:09.890
And then bonus problems which
are just optional.

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:12.210
But they're for people who
either find all the other

01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:14.750
problems easy or are
really curious.

01:05:14.750 --> 01:05:17.970
For them I put either synthesis
or evaluation.

01:05:17.970 --> 01:05:25.200
For example, in the
approximation class the last

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.320
problem set had design an
email indexing system.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.420
So that was the bonus problem.

01:05:31.420 --> 01:05:34.630
And there was a bunch of warm-up
and regular problems

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:37.240
which were involving Unix
text processing.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:39.170
And then for the people who are
really curious actually,

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:42.780
put it all together and make a
really fast email-indexing

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:45.020
system so you can just find any
email that you want just

01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:46.350
by doing keyword search.

01:05:46.350 --> 01:05:51.180
Sort of like a web search but
just on your email inbox.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:53.210
Because I actually
use that myself.

01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:55.980
Because I find folders
are just hopeless.

01:05:55.980 --> 01:05:57.150
It just takes all my time.

01:05:57.150 --> 01:05:58.910
I have to figure out what
folder things are in.

01:05:58.910 --> 01:06:00.210
And that could be many.

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:03.060
So I just keep it all in one
giant inbox with, I think,

01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.570
150,000 messages in it.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:06.880
And I just search
through that.

01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.680
And I have an index that's
rebuilt every week or so.

01:06:09.680 --> 01:06:11.870
And so I can search through
it really fast.

01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:15.360
So it's actually very practical
problem and it gives

01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:17.290
you an example of the levels
of things you can ask.

01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.520
So try to do it on
a fractal scale.

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:23.490
Each class should have
something, mix the levels each

01:06:23.490 --> 01:06:26.090
homework, the exam.

01:06:26.090 --> 01:06:29.886
So the general rule is to
mix them up all the way.

01:06:29.886 --> 01:06:30.820
OK?

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:37.200
So hopefully, from that, you
feel confident that you have

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:41.250
tools that you can make
interesting questions.

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:44.830
And this does have lots of
payoffs, which one of them is

01:06:44.830 --> 01:06:48.520
that questions that are
enjoyable and educational,

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.940
students love them.

01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:54.870
So when I practiced what I
preached and made these kind

01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:59.320
of problems, mix of problems for
my classes, often students

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:04.450
have said, oh, can you please
have more problems?

01:07:04.450 --> 01:07:06.710
Which is very rare.

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:08.450
They said, oh, these are some
of the most interesting

01:07:08.450 --> 01:07:10.140
problems I'm likely
to get at MIT.

01:07:10.140 --> 01:07:13.570
And I used to read them
out in my living of my

01:07:13.570 --> 01:07:15.820
independent-living group just
so that other people could

01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:17.170
hear the interesting problems
and we'd try

01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:18.680
to solve them together.

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:21.860
And then I've had several emails
after class finished,

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:24.270
saying, oh, you promised to post
the optional problem set.

01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:26.080
Where is it?

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:29.840
So it's because the problems,
actually, somehow connect to

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:32.710
things that people find
real and interesting.

01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:35.870
So that's a mix of
the perceptual.

01:07:35.870 --> 01:07:38.180
Don't make it just purely
symbol manipulation.

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.540
Try to connect to ways people
look at the world.

01:07:40.540 --> 01:07:44.994
But also, try to connect to
higher-level reasoning skills.

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:45.466
Question?

01:07:45.466 --> 01:07:47.354
AUDIENCE: Do you always
use bonus problems?

01:07:47.354 --> 01:07:48.330
PROFESSOR: I do.

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.570
I find that works really well.

01:07:49.570 --> 01:07:52.955
Because it's like a
pressure-escape valve.

01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:59.740
It caters for the diversity of
backgrounds in the class.

01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:03.980
The people who are feeling very
worried by the material,

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.680
they can just skip
them, no problem.

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.480
And they don't feel like
they have to do them.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:10.600
And they don't feel like, oh
my god, I can't do them.

01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:12.640
I'm going to get points off.

01:08:12.640 --> 01:08:15.030
And the people who find the
other stuff easy, they find

01:08:15.030 --> 01:08:16.080
something for them too.

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:20.450
So yeah, I try to always
use bonus problems.

01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:26.330
And I learned that from Knuth's
book, called Concrete

01:08:26.330 --> 01:08:27.800
Mathematics.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.279
So actually, I think they have
five levels of problems at the

01:08:30.279 --> 01:08:31.050
end of every chapter.

01:08:31.050 --> 01:08:32.460
There's warm ups.

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.850
There's homework problems.

01:08:34.850 --> 01:08:38.590
There's exam problems,
bonus problems,

01:08:38.590 --> 01:08:39.630
and research problems.

01:08:39.630 --> 01:08:41.029
So the research problems
were the ones

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:43.370
that are not yet solved.

01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:44.680
So at least you know they're
not yet solved.

01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:47.910
So you're going to be spending
a while on them.

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:49.850
And then in the second edition
I think some of them were

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:52.500
actually solved.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:58.290
OK, so if everyone could just
take a one minute and fill out

01:08:58.290 --> 01:08:59.970
the feedback sheet?

01:08:59.970 --> 01:09:04.410
Oh yeah, and let me just say,
why I'm doing this now at

01:09:04.410 --> 01:09:09.180
10:50, of the questions on the
sheets before was the feedback

01:09:09.180 --> 01:09:11.700
sheet, the person said, I've
been using them in my class

01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:12.560
and they've been
really useful.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:15.340
But I find that the response
rate has been dropping.

01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.819
What do you do about that?

01:09:16.819 --> 01:09:19.840
And I have to say, that I
found the same thing.

01:09:19.840 --> 01:09:21.550
This year I found
the same thing.

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:24.779
Not in this class but in my
other class, whereas I didn't

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:25.630
find that last year.

01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:26.850
And I was trying to
figure out why.

01:09:26.850 --> 01:09:29.410
And theory I have is that I was
trying to put in too much

01:09:29.410 --> 01:09:32.470
material in the class and not
leaving the students time

01:09:32.470 --> 01:09:36.020
before the five-minute mark
to fill out the sheet.

01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:39.790
So one thing, I've been trying
to mend my ways and make sure

01:09:39.790 --> 01:09:43.979
I end class at 9:50 or 10
minutes to the hour so the

01:09:43.979 --> 01:09:46.160
students have at least one or
two minutes to fill out the

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.910
sheet without feeling
pressured to get

01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:49.370
to their new class.

01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:52.420
So I'll let you know how that
goes over the next week.

01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:56.250
So take a minute now and then
that'll maybe make you think

01:09:56.250 --> 01:09:57.760
of some questions which
we can answer in

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.510
the next two minutes.

01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:01.140
And then while you're doing
that, just a couple

01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:02.010
announcements.

01:10:02.010 --> 01:10:05.890
So sorry I didn't say anything
before about what to do with

01:10:05.890 --> 01:10:08.160
the equation treatments that
you shared with each other.

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:11.540
So just discuss them
with each other.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:12.750
You have a collaborator.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:16.250
And then revise your treatment
based on what

01:10:16.250 --> 01:10:17.240
that person told you.

01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.790
You don't have to turn in
your revised treatment.

01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:20.310
You guys are all graduate
students, or

01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:21.290
almost all of you.

01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:23.600
You're all taking the class
because you're interested.

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.900
I'm not trying to
police everyone.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.990
But the goal here, and what
you should do, is take the

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:29.070
benefit of the collaboration,
revise your equation

01:10:29.070 --> 01:10:31.080
treatment, and share
it with each other.

01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:36.180
And then just bring in your
original one next week.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:40.290
And then I'll also have a couple
of readings for you to

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:41.690
do for next week.

01:10:41.690 --> 01:10:47.010
And also a short problem to work
on, things to think about

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:49.710
to bring in next week as well.

01:10:49.710 --> 01:10:53.674
OK, so sheets and
then questions.

01:10:53.674 --> 01:10:54.924
Question?

01:10:57.578 --> 01:11:00.366
AUDIENCE: So I tried doing these
sheets for a class that

01:11:00.366 --> 01:11:01.970
I was teaching yesterday.

01:11:01.970 --> 01:11:05.386
In fact, I found that I got
a response rate of 15%.

01:11:08.802 --> 01:11:12.605
If your response rate from the
beginning's very low and

01:11:12.605 --> 01:11:16.090
[INAUDIBLE] to increase
that rate?

01:11:16.090 --> 01:11:18.660
PROFESSOR: Right, so 15%, yeah,
I find I'm getting that

01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:19.530
around now too.

01:11:19.530 --> 01:11:21.600
And I think what's happened is
that I've got people in the

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:24.010
habit of not filling them out
because I wasn't giving them

01:11:24.010 --> 01:11:25.420
enough time.

01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:28.830
So I may be hosed because now
they're in the habit.

01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:30.015
So I'm trying to mend it.

01:11:30.015 --> 01:11:32.340
And I'll let you know if that
fixes it by giving people

01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.880
actual time before
they feel rushed.

01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:36.360
But it may be too late.

01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.630
And I worry that
it is too late.

01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:39.870
Because last year I was actually
more diligent about

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.250
making sure they had time.

01:11:41.250 --> 01:11:44.420
And I found the response rate
stayed about 60%, 70%.

01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:47.710
But even I find the
15% very useful.

01:11:47.710 --> 01:11:50.080
And I found that--

01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:52.970
people even in the past, when
the response rate was 30% in

01:11:52.970 --> 01:11:54.960
another class people said,
I didn't have a

01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.050
question all the time.

01:11:56.050 --> 01:11:58.450
But I knew when I did
I could ask it.

01:11:58.450 --> 01:12:00.420
So even the 15% isn't bad.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.670
It's still useful.

01:12:01.670 --> 01:12:03.090
But yeah, I would like
it to be higher.

01:12:03.090 --> 01:12:06.108
And I'll tell you
how that goes.

01:12:06.108 --> 01:12:06.570
Question?

01:12:06.570 --> 01:12:08.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.804
Wiggins and--

01:12:09.804 --> 01:12:10.900
PROFESSOR: McTighe, yeah.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.640
AUDIENCE: Oh, McTighe.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:14.960
Where are they based?

01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:17.010
PROFESSOR: So where are they?

01:12:17.010 --> 01:12:18.730
They're in New Jersey, and
they actually consult on

01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:23.230
educational course design and
run workshops and courses.

01:12:23.230 --> 01:12:24.770
And we actually invited
Wiggins last

01:12:24.770 --> 01:12:25.770
year to come and speak.

01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:29.000
So I'll put a short reading
selection from their book

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.870
called Understanding By Design
for optional reading for

01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:37.060
people so then you can learn
more about that.

01:12:37.060 --> 01:12:40.600
I find the basic form that
they say very useful.

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:44.300
I find applying it the way they
describe, sometimes I

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.750
just can't square it.

01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:48.990
But it may resonate with
you quite well.

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:50.820
And the overall approach
resonates very

01:12:50.820 --> 01:12:51.570
strongly with me.

01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:53.410
So hopefully you will
like it too.

01:12:53.410 --> 01:12:56.820
So I'll put that on the website
and some readings for

01:12:56.820 --> 01:13:00.284
next time about course design.

01:13:00.284 --> 01:13:00.780
Yes?

01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:02.880
AUDIENCE: Just a comment,
actually on your web page,

01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:05.620
where the response
sheet [INAUDIBLE]

01:13:05.620 --> 01:13:09.644
and situation where only a few
people were very dislike the

01:13:09.644 --> 01:13:10.894
current [INAUDIBLE].

01:13:13.198 --> 01:13:16.010
They don't like it this way and
so they want to change it.

01:13:16.010 --> 01:13:18.714
But the 80% who don't
feel [INAUDIBLE] is

01:13:18.714 --> 01:13:20.090
actually OK with it.

01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.640
[INAUDIBLE] the change.

01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:22.730
It makes most people unhappy.

01:13:22.730 --> 01:13:25.180
PROFESSOR: Unhappy, right,
so that can happen.

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:28.480
And so that's the silent
majority problem.

01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.540
So what I do when I get comments
like people saying,

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.500
well, I wasn't happy
about this.

01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:34.220
Sometimes what I do is--

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.780
especially if it doesn't
resonate with my intuition

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:37.470
about how things were
going, and I thought

01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:38.400
they were going well--

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.950
I'll say, well, there were a few
comments about this issue.

01:13:41.950 --> 01:13:43.700
What do people think?

01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.040
And just take an informal
straw pole

01:13:46.040 --> 01:13:47.636
before I make big changes.

01:13:47.636 --> 01:13:49.872
AUDIENCE: I think it helps to
have a positive question on

01:13:49.872 --> 01:13:52.348
[INAUDIBLE], like,
what did you take

01:13:52.348 --> 01:13:53.324
away from this lecture?

01:13:53.324 --> 01:13:54.300
Or what did you really
understand?

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:55.630
PROFESSOR: Right, I think
that's right.

01:13:55.630 --> 01:13:57.050
It helps to have a positive
question.

01:13:57.050 --> 01:14:01.110
So that's why I say, either what
you take away, or what

01:14:01.110 --> 01:14:01.980
helped or hurt?

01:14:01.980 --> 01:14:05.830
So there's an opportunity to
say something helpful.

01:14:05.830 --> 01:14:10.390
And any other comments is also
interpreted in a positive way.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:12.780
Answers from Lecture
5 to questions

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.340
generated in Lecture 4.

01:14:16.944 --> 01:14:19.760
PROFESSOR: OK, and questions
from last time.

01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:23.340
So they grouped into
several ones.

01:14:23.340 --> 01:14:29.300
One is how should you choose
your levels of your problems--

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:31.200
say, in class or in homeworks--
among the

01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.470
different levels of
Bloom's Taxonomy?

01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:38.620
Should it be, for example all
towards the evaluation?

01:14:38.620 --> 01:14:41.340
So your side would be here,
sort of the high level.

01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.370
A Mix?

01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:43.090
A flat mix?

01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:45.770
Should it be peaked towards the
middle with some tails?

01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:49.700
So that depends, partly,
on your course design.

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.110
So to answer that question, you
can't really answer that

01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:55.360
question until you figure out
what your course goals are.

01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:58.800
So in some ways there's an
argument for doing course

01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:03.320
design first and then working on
what problems to do and how

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:04.470
to design problems.

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:06.410
But actually, I like the
other way around.

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:08.400
I like doing course
design second.

01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:11.020
Because actually, doing problems
is concrete enough to

01:15:11.020 --> 01:15:11.800
do something.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:16.130
And then it leads to questions
about course design, which

01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:19.650
we'll answer how to
mix the levels.

01:15:19.650 --> 01:15:25.380
OK, another one was several
people wanted to know, why is

01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:27.640
tension not a force?

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.130
Or in fact, maybe is a force.

01:15:29.130 --> 01:15:30.390
So let me explain that.

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:33.680
Because that actually gives you
another example of sorting

01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:34.700
out misconceptions.

01:15:34.700 --> 01:15:35.690
So it's always useful.

01:15:35.690 --> 01:15:38.820
So I'll show you the sequence
of questions I used with

01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:41.910
myself when I finally
convinced that

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:43.360
tension wasn't a force.

01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:46.230
And here's how I did it.

01:15:46.230 --> 01:15:49.230
And then I used the same
sequence of questions with

01:15:49.230 --> 01:15:51.550
students to fight the
misconception that's been

01:15:51.550 --> 01:15:54.260
induced by many pictures of--

01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:55.920
for example-- a pulley.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:16:00.170
And here's a rope and
there's tension.

01:16:00.170 --> 01:16:01.440
Sorry, this is actually
done the other way.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.690
So here's the rope.

01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:07.010
And there's a t labeled there.

01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:11.430
And then on the mass there's a
force labeled as t upward.

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:13.565
So when you see that you think,
oh, tension's a force.

01:16:13.565 --> 01:16:15.250
So you see that a whole bunch
of times and you're pretty

01:16:15.250 --> 01:16:16.460
sure of it.

01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:21.060
So the sequence of questions
is as follows--

01:16:21.060 --> 01:16:27.210
say OK, here's a tree.

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:37.840
And I'm going to tie a rope to
the tree, rope or a string,

01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:39.590
it's a mass-less thing.

01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:40.900
And I put a force on it.

01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:48.130
OK, so I'm going to
pull that tree.

01:16:48.130 --> 01:16:49.250
The tree's not going
to go anywhere.

01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:50.500
We're going to pull
on the rope with

01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:52.240
100 newtons of force.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.910
OK, so you can try this
yourself too.

01:16:55.910 --> 01:16:57.350
What's the tension
in the string?

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:05.880
OK, so take 30 seconds and
I'll take a tension.

01:17:11.220 --> 01:17:12.470
OK, a tension, anyone?

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:22.945
AUDIENCE: 100 newtons.

01:17:22.945 --> 01:17:27.570
PROFESSOR: OK, so in fact
that is 100 newtons.

01:17:27.570 --> 01:17:29.140
And most people will
say 100 newtons.

01:17:29.140 --> 01:17:32.770
OK, so now the next
question is this--

01:17:32.770 --> 01:17:43.010
here is a river and
here's a rope.

01:17:43.010 --> 01:17:52.660
And me and a friend each pull on
the rope with 100 newtons.

01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:53.910
OK?

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:07.350
OK, so discuss with
your neighbor--

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:10.800
a, b, or c, what's the
tension in the rope?

01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:12.050
And we'll take a vote.

01:18:14.770 --> 01:18:19.200
OK, so take 10 seconds,
get your vote ready.

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.440
We'll take a quick straw pole.

01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.980
Who votes for 0 newtons?

01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.345
Who votes for 100 newtons?

01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:38.210
Who votes for 200 newtons?

01:18:42.190 --> 01:18:48.820
OK, so now here, how do you know
what it's going to be?

01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:50.320
Well, you make a
force diagram.

01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:53.090
And there's a way to convince
yourself that there's no doubt

01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:54.560
about what it should be.

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:56.630
And we just draw the forces
on the rope here.

01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:58.140
Oh, we've already done that.

01:18:58.140 --> 01:18:59.730
Let's draw the forces on
the rope up there.

01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:09.230
Well, what are the forces
on the rope here?

01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:11.520
Well, it's 100 newtons
from you.

01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:13.620
But there must also be 100
newtons from the tree.

01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:16.740
All right?

01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:20.350
So in fact, these two situations
are identical.

01:19:20.350 --> 01:19:22.415
So yeah, 100 newtons seems
pretty clear here.

01:19:22.415 --> 01:19:24.670
So it has to be 100 newtons
up there too.

01:19:28.590 --> 01:19:30.930
OK, now that--

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:32.410
so far-- isn't the hard part.

01:19:32.410 --> 01:19:36.320
But now is when you actually
create the contradiction with

01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:37.540
the idea of it being a force.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:42.480
It can't be a force because if
it were a force you would just

01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.700
add up vectors.

01:19:44.700 --> 01:19:44.940
Right?

01:19:44.940 --> 01:19:47.570
So there's a couple answers
you get if it was a force.

01:19:47.570 --> 01:19:49.960
If you're a bit sloppy you'd
just add up the magnitudes and

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.870
get 200 newtons.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.460
If it's really a vector--

01:19:53.460 --> 01:19:55.260
you're putting two vectors
on it, two forces--

01:19:55.260 --> 01:19:57.440
you should get 0 because they're
two opposite forces.

01:19:57.440 --> 01:19:59.460
But actually you get 100.

01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:01.630
The only way to get 100 is that
the tension has to be

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.810
something completely different
from a force.

01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:05.610
So that's how you know
it's not a force.

01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:06.880
But how do what it is?

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:12.170
Well, it turns out
to be a tensor.

01:20:12.170 --> 01:20:13.310
So it's not a vector.

01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:14.320
Forces are vectors.

01:20:14.320 --> 01:20:17.960
It adds differently
than vectors do.

01:20:17.960 --> 01:20:19.730
It adds like a tensor.

01:20:19.730 --> 01:20:23.130
So tension is more
like a pressure.

01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:25.190
It doesn't have a particular
direction.

01:20:25.190 --> 01:20:26.560
Pressure is in all directions.

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:29.590
So things like that, they can't
be described by vectors.

01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:30.610
So you need something else.

01:20:30.610 --> 01:20:32.520
And that's why we introduced
tensors.

01:20:32.520 --> 01:20:35.010
So now, in freshman physics I
wouldn't give them a whole

01:20:35.010 --> 01:20:36.360
story about tensors.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:40.650
But I do actually teach this
much of it so that they know

01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:42.230
that is a different object.

01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:44.880
And then what do I
do about this?

01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:50.840
Well, I won't write t unless
it's for myself.

01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:53.180
But for the students I think
it's sloppy and it increases

01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:54.300
misconception.

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:58.020
It's much better to write the
force sub t, which is the

01:20:58.020 --> 01:20:59.630
force due to tension.

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:00.030
OK?

01:21:00.030 --> 01:21:03.170
So even a slight change like
that can mitigate the rote

01:21:03.170 --> 01:21:05.930
learning, where people think
oh, tension's a force.

01:21:05.930 --> 01:21:08.100
Because you always see it drawn
like every other force.

01:21:08.100 --> 01:21:14.077
There's mg down, There's t
up, must be a force too.

01:21:14.077 --> 01:21:15.327
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:21:22.170 --> 01:21:25.120
PROFESSOR: What are the two
objects you hit it with to

01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:26.370
make a scalar?

01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:31.920
It's the two directions
that you're

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.600
interested in, basically.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:39.210
So it would be the x direction
or the direction along the

01:21:39.210 --> 01:21:42.854
string and the direction
along the string.

01:21:42.854 --> 01:21:45.546
AUDIENCE: So it's the
two direction then?

01:21:45.546 --> 01:21:48.700
PROFESSOR: You can use the
same direction twice.

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:49.840
So it's the direction
along the string

01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:50.560
and along the string.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.620
There's no cross direction.

01:21:53.620 --> 01:21:54.580
So it has no shear.

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:56.700
So there's no cross direction.

01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.880
So it's some component, tension
is one component of

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:02.530
the stress tensor.

01:22:02.530 --> 01:22:04.895
So now, again, freshman don't
need to know all the details.

01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:13.980
This is back to the subject of
lying they do need to not be

01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:15.310
told fundamental lies.

01:22:15.310 --> 01:22:20.080
Like for example, tension
is a force.

01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:24.520
OK, so now, how do you deal with
misconceptions that show

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:25.880
up on problem sets?

01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:26.690
This is a good question.

01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:29.150
So the point was made well, in
class you can sort it out

01:22:29.150 --> 01:22:29.630
right then.

01:22:29.630 --> 01:22:32.030
Suppose you ask a question, say,
about the Ideal Gas Law.

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:34.760
And you find that people have
confused the Ideal Gas Law and

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:35.910
the Adiabatic Gas Law.

01:22:35.910 --> 01:22:38.050
Well, you can talk about it
right then, which is a good

01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:39.740
reason to do those
things in class.

01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:41.900
What happens on the problem
set if you find there's a

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:43.120
bunch of misconceptions?

01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:45.860
Well, one thing is, the first
time you do the problem set,

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.830
yeah it's a bit of a problem.

01:22:46.830 --> 01:22:49.180
Because you don't know what the
misconceptions are unless

01:22:49.180 --> 01:22:51.260
you've researched
ahead of time.

01:22:51.260 --> 01:22:54.660
But the second time you do the
class you know what they are.

01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.700
So you can address the
misconceptions in

01:22:56.700 --> 01:22:58.040
the solution set.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:01.870
So when I'm not totally sleep
deprived I always try to get

01:23:01.870 --> 01:23:05.110
the solution set out the exact
same day that the problem set

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:05.880
is turned in.

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.840
So the students can
right away see.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.920
They can turn in their problem
set, pick up a solution set or

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:11.330
look at it online.

01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:13.390
So they can right away
get quick feedback.

01:23:13.390 --> 01:23:17.710
And they can sort out the
misconceptions that way.

01:23:17.710 --> 01:23:20.050
So that's a good question.

01:23:20.050 --> 01:23:20.860
So it is harder.

01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:21.480
Yes, question?

01:23:21.480 --> 01:23:25.316
AUDIENCE: What do you do about
the fact that a lot of people

01:23:25.316 --> 01:23:27.842
will just ignore the
solution sets?

01:23:27.842 --> 01:23:31.050
Or do you just consider
that their problem?

01:23:31.050 --> 01:23:33.300
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
what do I do about people who

01:23:33.300 --> 01:23:34.540
just ignore the solution sets?

01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:35.930
Because a lot of students
do that.

01:23:35.930 --> 01:23:40.200
Yeah, partly I consider
it their problem.

01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:43.420
Because look, that's there
for them to learn.

01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:46.640
But partly, to the extent that
they're ignoring the solution

01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:49.140
set because they only cared
about the grade.

01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:50.970
So one cause of that
is they really only

01:23:50.970 --> 01:23:51.760
care about the grade.

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:54.050
So they just want to wait for
the grader to give them back

01:23:54.050 --> 01:23:57.440
their solutions, their problem
set with a mark on it.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.060
And they don't care what's
right and wrong.

01:23:59.060 --> 01:24:01.390
That, I think, partly, is our
responsibility that we've

01:24:01.390 --> 01:24:04.620
chosen boring problems.

01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:08.300
So to fix that, I think, one
of the key areas is to use

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:10.650
more of the Bloom's Taxonomy and
make interesting problems.

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:14.420
And the flip side is to
deemphasize the grading.

01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:17.770
So actually, I like the
PDF scale on homework.

01:24:17.770 --> 01:24:20.180
I think we are too
micromanaging, generally,

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.150
about homework, you know,
grading it on a percentage

01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:26.070
scale, on A, B, C, D. P,
you did a reasonable.

01:24:26.070 --> 01:24:29.290
And D, you blew it off.

01:24:29.290 --> 01:24:30.810
You did something but
it was a joke.

01:24:30.810 --> 01:24:32.660
And F, you didn't turn it in.

01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:35.910
I think that scale puts the
right emphasis on the grading.

01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:38.590
Look, we just want you to
do the thing and try it.

01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:42.160
And if the problems are
interesting that allows people

01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:43.840
to actually get involved
in it.

01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.010
So there's lots of studies that
show that if you reward

01:24:47.010 --> 01:24:49.570
people for things they
already enjoy--

01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:51.580
so you start paying them more
for doing things they really

01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.551
like-- they actually start
liking them less.

01:24:54.551 --> 01:24:57.250
So I'll talk about that as one
of the political barriers to

01:24:57.250 --> 01:24:58.080
educational change.

01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:01.550
Because that's completely
against the conventional

01:25:01.550 --> 01:25:04.210
psychology of this society,
where everything has to be

01:25:04.210 --> 01:25:06.280
rewarded, merit-based pay
and this and that.

01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:07.560
So how do you go against that?

01:25:07.560 --> 01:25:08.770
It's quite difficult.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.550
But one way, in general, in
those problem sets is to

01:25:11.550 --> 01:25:13.030
deemphasize the grading.

01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:14.140
Related method--

01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:16.730
which I haven't tried yet
but I'm planning to--

01:25:16.730 --> 01:25:19.540
is reading memos on
the solution set.

01:25:19.540 --> 01:25:21.720
So I talked about reading
memos before.

01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:24.250
And maybe one of you will try
it before me and can tell me

01:25:24.250 --> 01:25:24.970
how it works.

01:25:24.970 --> 01:25:25.710
A reading memo is--

01:25:25.710 --> 01:25:28.710
I talked about-- where you
have the students take a

01:25:28.710 --> 01:25:31.690
reading and mark--
either online or

01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:32.980
on a piece of paper--

01:25:32.980 --> 01:25:35.360
things that were confusing or
things that were interesting

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:37.610
and things they noticed.

01:25:37.610 --> 01:25:39.980
Well, you can do that with
the solution set too.

01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:44.870
You say, OK, your assignment,
homework 3A is to look at the

01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:47.230
solution set for homework
two and mark

01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:48.890
anything that's confusing.

01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:51.200
So that forces people to
read the solution set.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:53.615
And often what you'll find is
that they'll find mistakes in

01:25:53.615 --> 01:25:56.210
the solution set, which is good
to know because you can

01:25:56.210 --> 01:25:57.120
correct them right away.

01:25:57.120 --> 01:26:01.028
But you'll see what parts are
confusing to students or not.

01:26:01.028 --> 01:26:02.880
Did that help answer
your question?

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.290
Great.

01:26:05.290 --> 01:26:07.480
Do I ever asked Wheeler's
question explicitly?

01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:09.140
Yes, sometimes.

01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:11.610
I should do it more in
class in lecture.

01:26:11.610 --> 01:26:13.380
But I do it a lot to myself.

01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:15.090
Whenever I solve a problem
I think oh,

01:26:15.090 --> 01:26:16.590
what was the key idea?

01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:20.440
And then once I see the key idea
happen many times I think

01:26:20.440 --> 01:26:21.830
oh, that's a very key idea.

01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:24.190
That should be taught
explicitly in class.

01:26:24.190 --> 01:26:25.190
So I do that.

01:26:25.190 --> 01:26:27.100
And I'm going to talk about
that principle of course

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:29.990
design today, basically
organizing courses around

01:26:29.990 --> 01:26:32.980
large themes and principles,
which is one of the main

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:35.850
[? cures. ?]

01:26:35.850 --> 01:26:39.730
OK, so what's wrong with
tension as a force?

01:26:39.730 --> 01:26:43.380
How far should I go
down the taxonomy?

01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:46.290
Basically, where in the
course should I be?

01:26:46.290 --> 01:26:49.150
Really low in the taxonomy
early and higher later?

01:26:49.150 --> 01:26:50.650
Well, I talked about that
a bit last time.

01:26:50.650 --> 01:26:52.560
The fractal picture
is not bad.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.600
So yeah, you have a few
low-level examples and

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.530
higher-level examples.

01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:59.560
But you do that throughout
the course.

01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.200
So you don't wait until the end
of the course to get the

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:05.120
reward of the really interesting
problems.

01:27:05.120 --> 01:27:08.350
And then related to that, what
about exams and homework?

01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:10.500
Should they be the same
or different?

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:14.380
My view is they should be the
same given the constraint that

01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:16.200
maybe the exam is done
in a shorter time.

01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.460
So if anything, the
exam should be

01:27:17.460 --> 01:27:19.190
easier than the homework.

01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:21.010
Generally, homework people
will spend six

01:27:21.010 --> 01:27:23.070
or seven hours on.

01:27:23.070 --> 01:27:25.160
When I was an undergraduate
we had take-home exams.

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.680
And we would spend
24 hours on them.

01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:27.900
You pick them up, you
signed it out.

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.070
You'd turned it in
in 24 hours.

01:27:29.070 --> 01:27:30.200
So that was misery.

01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:31.680
And it was interesting.

01:27:31.680 --> 01:27:32.430
You learnt a lot.

01:27:32.430 --> 01:27:34.670
But it was kind of miserable
because it just wiped out a

01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:36.960
whole day from your quarter.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.285
And you had that for
four classes.

01:27:38.285 --> 01:27:40.950
So four days from your quarter
were just gone.

01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:44.220
So generally, exams are three
hours, maybe two hours.

01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.430
And so that's much less time
than a homework set.

01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:48.600
So if anything, exams
should be easier,

01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:49.860
definitely not harder.

01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:53.210
Student loath when the exam does
different things than the

01:27:53.210 --> 01:27:54.700
problem sets.

01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:56.850
And that is a general principle
of course design,

01:27:56.850 --> 01:27:58.720
that if you want to prepare
them for being able to do

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.580
stuff-- for example
on the exam--

01:28:00.580 --> 01:28:02.110
you have to prepare
them with things.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:04.560
You have to "teach to the test."
That's actually good.

01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:06.940
You want your homeworks
to be like the exam.

01:28:06.940 --> 01:28:09.580
And that's fine if
the test is good.

01:28:09.580 --> 01:28:12.770
If the test tests real-world,
interesting skills sure, then

01:28:12.770 --> 01:28:14.610
it's fine to teach the test
because they'll come out being

01:28:14.610 --> 01:28:16.290
able to do that, no problem.

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:18.580
So the exam and homework-- as
a rough rule of function--

01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.770
will be pretty much the same.

01:28:19.770 --> 01:28:21.790
Or if anything, the exam
should be easier.

01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:35.150
Oh yeah, the first time
you teach a class.

01:28:35.150 --> 01:28:38.000
So all this Bloom's Taxonomy
and designing questions, it

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:38.860
takes a long time.

01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:40.580
And it's really hard to
make good questions.

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:43.040
It's easy to make define
XYZ questions.

01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:44.710
But what about the higher-level
questions?

01:28:44.710 --> 01:28:47.620
What do you do to mitigate
that problem of a

01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.550
huge amount of time?

01:28:49.550 --> 01:28:53.850
Well, one of the cures is to
cooperate with other teachers.

01:28:53.850 --> 01:28:55.870
So you steal their
good problems.

01:28:55.870 --> 01:28:58.830
So I gave you the T.S. Eliot
saying before, that talent

01:28:58.830 --> 01:29:00.850
invents and genius steals.

01:29:00.850 --> 01:29:03.070
So be a genius.

01:29:03.070 --> 01:29:05.010
Whenever you see a good
problem just use it.

01:29:05.010 --> 01:29:07.590
And whenever someone wants
a good problem, if you

01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:09.050
have one, share it.

01:29:09.050 --> 01:29:11.830
And now, should you guard
your problems?

01:29:11.830 --> 01:29:17.030
I think those days of guarding
problems are gone.

01:29:17.030 --> 01:29:20.840
They've gone by because of
things like OpenCourseWare,

01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.610
putting problem sets online.

01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:24.980
It's just not possible anymore
to guard problems.

01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:26.500
I'm not sure it was
ever a good idea.

01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:28.290
But now it's not
even practical.

01:29:28.290 --> 01:29:32.940
So everything is online, all
from the previous year.

01:29:32.940 --> 01:29:34.760
So the problems can't
be guarded.

01:29:34.760 --> 01:29:37.480
And it's not practical to make
up a whole set of new good

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:38.830
problems for the next year.

01:29:38.830 --> 01:29:40.730
You'll never sleep.

01:29:40.730 --> 01:29:45.050
So I just trust the students not
to cheat by looking at the

01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:46.280
old solution sets.

01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:51.550
And if you're grading, that's
yet another reason to minimize

01:29:51.550 --> 01:29:53.350
how strict the grading is.

01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:55.740
So if the grading is really,
just that they make an effort

01:29:55.740 --> 01:29:58.410
and try to learn something,
then there's no benefit to

01:29:58.410 --> 01:30:01.080
cheating and looking at
the old solution sets.

01:30:01.080 --> 01:30:05.220
So you actually make the
incentive structure so that

01:30:05.220 --> 01:30:06.280
they don't need to do all that.

01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:06.700
Question?

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.197
AUDIENCE: Do you have to change
your problem to a

01:30:08.197 --> 01:30:11.357
certain extent in terms
of plagiarism?

01:30:14.145 --> 01:30:16.000
PROFESSOR: So the question is,
do I have to change the

01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.560
problems to a certain extent
to avoid plagiarism?

01:30:18.560 --> 01:30:19.770
I don't even care.

01:30:19.770 --> 01:30:20.980
I don't even change them.

01:30:20.980 --> 01:30:24.060
I think, again, it's sort of
what Adrian has said, is it

01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:25.330
their problem if they do it?

01:30:25.330 --> 01:30:27.240
And to some extent it
is their problem.

01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.390
If they're going to cheat and
look at the old solution set

01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:33.020
and not acknowledge it.

01:30:33.020 --> 01:30:34.970
There's only so much
you can do.

01:30:34.970 --> 01:30:38.550
And you then get in an
arms race with them.

01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:40.870
You change the problem
to some extent.

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:43.370
But then someone
else makes it.

01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:44.670
So they can always
subvert that.

01:30:44.670 --> 01:30:46.700
One person can solve the new
problem and give it to

01:30:46.700 --> 01:30:47.800
everybody else.

01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:52.030
So you have no hope of actually
winning that war,

01:30:52.030 --> 01:30:54.470
even if it were a moral
war to try to win.

01:30:54.470 --> 01:30:55.610
So I don't even change them.

01:30:55.610 --> 01:30:57.500
And I say look, just
acknowledge, just like you

01:30:57.500 --> 01:30:59.620
would in science.

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:03.230
I think it's Larry Lessig,
the copyright scholar,

01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:04.210
professor of law.

01:31:04.210 --> 01:31:04.980
He used to be at Harvard.

01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:06.170
Now it's Stanford.

01:31:06.170 --> 01:31:10.640
He founded Creative Commons
and various fantastic

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:11.410
copyright projects.

01:31:11.410 --> 01:31:15.650
So he said, well, there's a
couple ways to get-- not

01:31:15.650 --> 01:31:16.560
compliance--

01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:17.460
people to do things.

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:20.360
One is you can do it
through rules.

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.580
For example, this is illegal.

01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.390
You just can't do this.

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:24.657
We'll punish you
if you do this.

01:31:24.657 --> 01:31:26.360
The other one is through norm.

01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.120
So this is just not done.

01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.690
In our community we just don't
do things like that.

01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:33.560
And generally, this kind
of-- not exhortation--

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:38.940
but push works much better
than the punishment kind.

01:31:38.940 --> 01:31:44.260
So I just tell them, look, in
science when you grow up and

01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:48.300
become a scientist of course you
acknowledge your peers and

01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:49.140
people you learn from.

01:31:49.140 --> 01:31:50.640
Because that's just polite.

01:31:50.640 --> 01:31:51.910
It's just how we are.

01:31:51.910 --> 01:31:52.830
We say, please.

01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:55.090
We don't say gimme,
gimme, gimme.

01:31:55.090 --> 01:31:56.860
I'm working on teaching my
daughter that right now.

01:31:56.860 --> 01:31:59.490
She says, daddy read.

01:31:59.490 --> 01:32:00.020
Daddy read.

01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:00.780
Mommy read.

01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:01.600
Elsa read.

01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:02.990
I'm like OK, I'm fine
with the Elsa read.

01:32:02.990 --> 01:32:04.530
But daddy read, mommy
read, that's nice.

01:32:04.530 --> 01:32:05.320
And we love reading.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.660
But how do you ask?

01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:10.410
And now she says mommy read
please, daddy read please.

01:32:10.410 --> 01:32:13.380
And so it's the start.

01:32:13.380 --> 01:32:15.170
So people already learnt
that from young.

01:32:15.170 --> 01:32:16.380
So you can tap into that.

01:32:16.380 --> 01:32:19.370
Look, how do you act as a
member of the community?

01:32:19.370 --> 01:32:20.320
We're social animals.

01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.320
So you don't have
to put too much

01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:22.660
pressure in that direction.

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:24.490
Whereas if you try to do it
through a punishment you have

01:32:24.490 --> 01:32:26.760
to work much harder.

01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:29.030
The punishment one--

01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.650
underneath--

01:32:29.650 --> 01:32:32.670
has the idea that we don't
trust the students.

01:32:32.670 --> 01:32:32.870
Right?

01:32:32.870 --> 01:32:36.250
And in that way it's common with
changing the numbers on

01:32:36.250 --> 01:32:38.420
the problems set.

01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:41.130
It's that we don't trust you so
we're changing the numbers.

01:32:41.130 --> 01:32:45.550
So I try to avoid those things
as much as possible and try to

01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:47.170
go more towards this.

01:32:47.170 --> 01:32:47.620
Yes?

01:32:47.620 --> 01:32:50.987
AUDIENCE: Has anyone tried
to have problem

01:32:50.987 --> 01:32:52.430
sets without solutions?

01:32:52.430 --> 01:32:56.278
So then there's no grading.

01:32:56.278 --> 01:32:59.660
And then the problem sets
are just for practicing.

01:32:59.660 --> 01:33:03.090
PROFESSOR: Yeah, have problem
sets for practice with no

01:33:03.090 --> 01:33:05.600
solutions or no grading
on the problem sets?

01:33:05.600 --> 01:33:06.410
Have people tried that?

01:33:06.410 --> 01:33:08.020
So there's actually
whole educational

01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:09.540
systems based on that.

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:12.580
Not so much in America, but
in England, the Oxford and

01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.520
Cambridge tutorial system.

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.030
You're given problems
to work on.

01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:19.100
So I was on both sides
of that system.

01:33:19.100 --> 01:33:21.790
You're given problems to
work with your tutor.

01:33:21.790 --> 01:33:23.650
And they're not graded.

01:33:23.650 --> 01:33:25.370
I mean, your tutor helps
you make sure that

01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:26.640
you can do the problems.

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:29.380
But everything that's graded
happens at the end.

01:33:29.380 --> 01:33:31.240
Well, when I was an
undergraduate it happened at

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:32.640
the end of your entire degree.

01:33:32.640 --> 01:33:36.050
There was eight three-hour
exams that counted for

01:33:36.050 --> 01:33:36.460
everything.

01:33:36.460 --> 01:33:37.920
And nothing else counted.

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.550
So it had some craziness.

01:33:40.550 --> 01:33:42.960
That time at the end was
pretty stressful.

01:33:42.960 --> 01:33:46.610
But before that your tutor
was actually your friend.

01:33:46.610 --> 01:33:48.570
And your tutor wasn't the
person doing the exams.

01:33:48.570 --> 01:33:51.190
So you would do problems because
you wanted to learn

01:33:51.190 --> 01:33:53.070
and your tutor would help you
so that you would do well on

01:33:53.070 --> 01:33:54.900
the exam that other people
were setting.

01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:58.476
So you had a nice alliance
with your tutor.

01:33:58.476 --> 01:34:00.284
AUDIENCE: Does that work well?

01:34:03.105 --> 01:34:04.750
PROFESSOR: I would say
it works well.

01:34:04.750 --> 01:34:07.190
At MIT it would work great.

01:34:07.190 --> 01:34:08.220
Given [INAUDIBLE]

01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:10.880
that people are too
overloaded.

01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:13.430
And they would say, oh well, if
there's not going to be any

01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:15.700
grading at all, I don't have
to do anything, while I'd

01:34:15.700 --> 01:34:17.230
really like to do this
problem set.

01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:19.590
But I have four other classes
that are making me work 20

01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:20.180
hours a week.

01:34:20.180 --> 01:34:21.630
And I don't have any time.

01:34:21.630 --> 01:34:23.580
So then because of the
other pressures

01:34:23.580 --> 01:34:24.290
they might fall away.

01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:25.300
But they would like to do it.

01:34:25.300 --> 01:34:28.510
So that's why I compromise by
just saying, you have to do

01:34:28.510 --> 01:34:29.940
the thing and make an effort.

01:34:29.940 --> 01:34:32.500
And then I trust that once they
start trying it they'll

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:35.700
enjoy doing it.

01:34:35.700 --> 01:34:38.490
So I tried to make it as light
as I think you can get away

01:34:38.490 --> 01:34:40.020
with at MIT, given the
pressures from

01:34:40.020 --> 01:34:41.410
all the other teachers.

01:34:41.410 --> 01:34:44.230
But in the ideal world I think
that's what we would do here.

01:34:44.230 --> 01:34:45.195
There wouldn't be
that pressure.

01:34:45.195 --> 01:34:47.760
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:51.880
PROFESSOR: Yeah, in Oxford and
Cambridge it works very well,

01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.440
provided you have
a good tutor.

01:34:53.440 --> 01:34:57.790
And there's many students who
are there just because it's a

01:34:57.790 --> 01:35:00.200
thing to do, to go to Oxford
and Cambridge.

01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:02.780
But if you factor out those
students who are just there

01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:06.040
for the stamp of the place,
for the other students it

01:35:06.040 --> 01:35:07.305
works fantastically well.

01:35:07.305 --> 01:35:11.210
I mean, the tutorials are
a great discussion time.

01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:14.460
You can really kindle people's
curiosity because it's really

01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:16.130
not based on grading, it's
based on helping.

01:35:16.130 --> 01:35:17.380
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:35:20.189 --> 01:35:22.210
PROFESSOR: It's so hard to do.

01:35:22.210 --> 01:35:23.360
I mean, I don't know
of any comparative

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:25.360
studies within one culture.

01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.380
And I don't think you could
really do them well between,

01:35:27.380 --> 01:35:30.290
say, the English universities
and the American just because

01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:32.220
there's so many other social
variables that are so

01:35:32.220 --> 01:35:36.760
different like the population
that goes to university, which

01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:40.200
universities are talking about
the exam system itself, so I

01:35:40.200 --> 01:35:43.440
don't know of any studies that
have been done across cultures

01:35:43.440 --> 01:35:44.900
and that I would trust.

01:35:44.900 --> 01:35:47.310
And within I don't
know of any.

01:35:47.310 --> 01:35:49.570
But it's a good question.

01:35:49.570 --> 01:35:53.490
I know studies in general about
rewards, which is that

01:35:53.490 --> 01:35:58.480
the more you reward people for
things that they like the less

01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:00.570
they like doing them.

01:36:00.570 --> 01:36:03.510
So I might give you some
readings for that for very

01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:05.860
last penultimate session.

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:09.170
And for the reading that I'm
going to give you for the next

01:36:09.170 --> 01:36:11.365
session is going to be about
tutoring, actually.

01:36:11.365 --> 01:36:15.040
So I'll put that on
the website today.

01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.110
OK, questions?

01:36:16.110 --> 01:36:16.608
Yes?

01:36:16.608 --> 01:36:19.098
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
of a question.

01:36:19.098 --> 01:36:23.331
So I was wondering, if you do
exams or homework problems

01:36:23.331 --> 01:36:25.904
throughout the semester, you
can, maybe, also better

01:36:25.904 --> 01:36:30.350
monitor how the students develop
compared to having one

01:36:30.350 --> 01:36:32.326
big exam on the end.

01:36:32.326 --> 01:36:34.796
And then maybe using [INAUDIBLE]
lectures.

01:36:34.796 --> 01:36:38.860
PROFESSOR: Right, so having
continuous assessment is one

01:36:38.860 --> 01:36:39.500
phrase for it.

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:42.170
It allows you to monitor, make
sure things are going OK.

01:36:42.170 --> 01:36:44.640
So all of a sudden you don't
find, oh my god, the person

01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:45.100
didn't know anything.

01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:47.220
They got a third, which is
like straight D's in your

01:36:47.220 --> 01:36:48.770
whole undergraduate.

01:36:48.770 --> 01:36:51.140
So in Oxford and Cambridge
things are graded on first,

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:52.000
second, third.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:54.980
And all of a sudden you had had
no idea the student was

01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:56.600
going to get a third,
or they were sick or

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:57.660
something like that.

01:36:57.660 --> 01:36:59.340
So I think, yeah.

01:36:59.340 --> 01:37:04.100
So homework problems and exams
have a really good purpose in

01:37:04.100 --> 01:37:06.890
assessment and helping students
get feedback on how

01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:09.620
they're doing as well.

01:37:09.620 --> 01:37:12.140
So for that purpose,
grading is useful.

01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:16.300
And one solution to that
dilemma-- because I don't like

01:37:16.300 --> 01:37:18.940
to grade exactly because
it stresses them

01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:19.790
out with the grade--

01:37:19.790 --> 01:37:22.030
is to give them the solution
set right away.

01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:24.580
So they can get feedback from
the solution set whether they

01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:28.103
understood things, not whether
they had a 90 or and 80, but

01:37:28.103 --> 01:37:29.620
whether it made sense to them.

01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:31.980
And that's, I think, a much
more important thing.

01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:34.160
But then the other part of
grading, which is that it's

01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:35.310
used publicly--

01:37:35.310 --> 01:37:37.630
as part of your record and
written to other people--

01:37:37.630 --> 01:37:40.420
that part of grading I
think is not right.

01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:43.440
I don't think it's morally right
to, basically, reveal

01:37:43.440 --> 01:37:45.860
information about students to
other people without their

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:46.300
permission.

01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:48.530
I don't think that should be the
purpose of the university.

01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:51.600
But the other purpose of
grading, helping students know

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:52.550
where they are.

01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:54.980
And helping us know where they
are so we can help them more,

01:37:54.980 --> 01:37:56.550
I think, is a completely
valid purpose.

01:37:59.710 --> 01:38:06.280
OK, so there was another
suggestion which was to use as

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:09.180
many non-physics and math
examples as possible.

01:38:09.180 --> 01:38:12.710
So I'll try to reform my ways
for the non physicists and

01:38:12.710 --> 01:38:13.100
mathematicians.

01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:16.530
It's just those come most
naturally for me.

01:38:16.530 --> 01:38:18.950
OK, so I think that
was the main--

01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:19.750
yes, question?

01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:22.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:38:22.630 --> 01:38:25.990
for evaluating the students or
for teaching the students.

01:38:25.990 --> 01:38:26.970
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

01:38:26.970 --> 01:38:27.890
AUDIENCE: Homeworks?

01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:30.230
PROFESSOR: Yes, for evaluating
versus for teaching?

01:38:30.230 --> 01:38:35.367
AUDIENCE: Yes, because that's
one thing to evaluate, right?

01:38:35.367 --> 01:38:36.768
[INAUDIBLE]?

01:38:36.768 --> 01:38:38.360
PROFESSOR: It's both.

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.900
So there's two, yeah.

01:38:39.900 --> 01:38:42.870
So the other purpose is that
they learn and they do things.

01:38:42.870 --> 01:38:43.780
That's for sure.

01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:45.210
So you want them to do that.

01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:46.930
And you can do that in
class and homework.

01:38:46.930 --> 01:38:49.900
And the take-home exams that
we had when I was an

01:38:49.900 --> 01:38:51.405
undergraduate had that
purpose too.

01:38:51.405 --> 01:38:54.510
You spent 24 hours really
learning stuff.

01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:57.170
So that purpose is
very valid too.

01:38:57.170 --> 01:38:59.740
But it's also very valid to know
where the students are.

01:38:59.740 --> 01:39:03.230
So for example, that basically
closes the feedback loop.

01:39:03.230 --> 01:39:05.090
You're doing all this stuff.

01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:07.000
And now you're seeing
the result of it.

01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:08.990
And you want to know, well,
did any of it take?

01:39:08.990 --> 01:39:10.160
Did any of it stick?

01:39:10.160 --> 01:39:12.920
And if none of it did, well,
maybe you want to change what

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:13.350
you're doing.

01:39:13.350 --> 01:39:16.654
AUDIENCE: Oh, but you
cannot evaluate a

01:39:16.654 --> 01:39:17.598
person every week, right?

01:39:17.598 --> 01:39:21.106
And that's what drives students
to copy solutions

01:39:21.106 --> 01:39:25.360
because they care
about the grade.

01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.922
[INAUDIBLE].

01:39:26.922 --> 01:39:28.110
PROFESSOR: That's
why distinguish

01:39:28.110 --> 01:39:29.930
two senses of evaluate.

01:39:29.930 --> 01:39:31.260
There's evaluate
for the purpose

01:39:31.260 --> 01:39:32.590
of helping the students.

01:39:32.590 --> 01:39:34.570
And there's evaluate for the
purpose of publishing their

01:39:34.570 --> 01:39:36.900
grades elsewhere.

01:39:36.900 --> 01:39:38.920
And it's the publishing
their grades elsewhere

01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:40.050
that worries them.

01:39:40.050 --> 01:39:41.840
So you want to minimize
that part.

01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:44.620
And you want to do as much
evaluation towards helping

01:39:44.620 --> 01:39:45.620
them as possible.

01:39:45.620 --> 01:39:48.140
So a solution set-- for example,
one thing you can do

01:39:48.140 --> 01:39:49.450
is say OK, here's the
solution set.

01:39:49.450 --> 01:39:52.170
Ask me about anything
that's confusing.

01:39:52.170 --> 01:39:54.430
And then you can put some of
the responsibility for this

01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:56.780
evaluation onto them so
it's self evaluation.

01:39:56.780 --> 01:39:59.830
But you're still using the
homework for evaluation.

01:39:59.830 --> 01:40:01.630
It's just you're not
trying to say look,

01:40:01.630 --> 01:40:02.290
that's the main thing.

01:40:02.290 --> 01:40:04.370
I'm going to use that to tell
everyone else about it.

01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:06.050
That's what worries them
and produces copying.

01:40:06.050 --> 01:40:08.580
So you want to minimize that
as much as possible.

01:40:08.580 --> 01:40:09.510
And it's hard.

01:40:09.510 --> 01:40:12.890
And that's the subject of the
political obstacles to

01:40:12.890 --> 01:40:15.430
educational change session
that'll be in the

01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:18.460
second-to-last lecture.

01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:21.120
OK, so yeah, I don't pretend
any of these have easy

01:40:21.120 --> 01:40:24.370
answers, unfortunately.

01:40:24.370 --> 01:40:26.640
Oh, there was another
suggestion, which is that I

01:40:26.640 --> 01:40:31.040
make a web forum where people
can ask questions afterwards.

01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:32.290
Because it's hard sometimes
think of a

01:40:32.290 --> 01:40:34.550
question on the fly.

01:40:34.550 --> 01:40:35.160
And that's true.

01:40:35.160 --> 01:40:38.300
And the problem is it's not easy
to make web forms on the

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.700
MIT.edu site.

01:40:40.700 --> 01:40:42.390
So I'll try to figure out
a way to do that.

01:40:42.390 --> 01:40:46.320
But for security reasons you
can't really easily make web

01:40:46.320 --> 01:40:50.460
forms that just append to a
file or do something like

01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:52.870
that, although I'm going to
look into it and see what

01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:54.210
workarounds I can find.

01:40:54.210 --> 01:40:54.490
Yes?

01:40:54.490 --> 01:40:56.033
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:40:56.033 --> 01:40:56.875
scripts?

01:40:56.875 --> 01:40:59.370
PROFESSOR: Yeah, you can
use scripts at MIT.edu.

01:40:59.370 --> 01:41:02.540
So I have to figure out
how to use that.

01:41:02.540 --> 01:41:04.600
But yeah, I had that in
the back of my mind.

01:41:04.600 --> 01:41:05.830
But thanks for pointing
that out.

01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:06.090
Yeah?

01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:06.990
AUDIENCE: What about forms?

01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:08.300
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:08.820
AUDIENCE: Forms?

01:41:08.820 --> 01:41:09.550
PROFESSOR: Forms?

01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:11.588
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

01:41:11.588 --> 01:41:13.440
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so then
you get email.

01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:16.110
So the only problem with that is
that you get a ton of spam.

01:41:16.110 --> 01:41:19.580
So there are all these spam
bots that float around and

01:41:19.580 --> 01:41:22.650
just fill out forms and send
junk emails all the time.

01:41:22.650 --> 01:41:27.880
So maybe that can be filtered
out and it's not so bad.

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:31.350
So but yeah, that's one of the
few things you can do on

01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:35.150
MIT.edu, directly on
the web.MIT.edu.

01:41:35.150 --> 01:41:36.550
So there's a very
solutions to it.

01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:39.790
I'll try to think of something
around that because it is a

01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:41.790
good suggestion.

01:41:41.790 --> 01:41:43.040
OK.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.590
Those of us who live in this
amazing world of science

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.220
and engineering have got
to pay more attention

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.210
how to speak to the public.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.860
I am convinced one
approach is to embrace

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.620
the value of the visual--
that when we find better

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.250
vocabularies to express
complicated ideas,

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.200
there will be less confusion
across the globe about how

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.950
to make critical
decisions that will affect

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.440
our health and our planet, to
educate all our cultures on how

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.600
to distinguish between
opinion and fact.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.040
One approach is to engage the
public in our conversations.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.040
And we can do that creating
honest, accessible, compelling,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.980
even beautiful images
of our research

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.230
so that our work will
become less intimidating,

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.480
where your mother
or father will not

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:03.000
be embarrassed to ask
questions about the images they

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.890
see of your work.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.120
That's part of the
philosophy of this course,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.970
in case you didn't notice.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.240
But so much of what we do in our
labs is difficult to explain.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.260
So first, here's where
I'd like to briefly touch

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.800
on the potential of
visual metaphors.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.150
For example, you've
seen this music box

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.010
throughout this course.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.130
I made the image for our
book "No Small Matter"

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.820
to engage the reader to
think about the language

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.530
of computation, a binary
language, either on or off,

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.880
as this music box's
clever system works.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.280
It's either one or zero.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.240
Take a good look
and think about it.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.560
Here's another one
of these metaphors

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.770
along the same thinking of
explaining binary language.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.430
These are small drinking
glasses viewed from above.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.000
The ones filled with red
(good shiraz, by the way!)

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.040
represent one in
this binary system.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.110
The empty glasses
represent zero.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.710
Again, for the book,
"No Small Matter."

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.440
The first row across represents
12 in our everyday number

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.790
system.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:20.329
If we add the second row, 22,
the result in the third row

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.540
is 34.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.170
12 plus 22 equals 34.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.140
Here's another
you've seen before.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.640
We call it etching
with light, suggesting

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.090
how some surfaces we work with
in the laboratory can be etched

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.440
with various patterns.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.360
And here, this
cascade could suggest

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.990
how the flow of electrons
change from one energy state

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.079
to another.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.530
Here's one I think
that works quite well.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.210
These graduation chairs
are lined up basically

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.600
to guide parents where to sit.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.900
It's a metaphor for
something called templated

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.480
or guided self assembly.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.500
Just as when DNA replicates
itself, each of its strands

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.550
guides the distribution of
bases for the new strand.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.630
Here's one that I
did love making,

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.370
but maybe it doesn't
quite work enough.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.550
I wanted to show the
counterintuiveness

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.690
of quantum mechanics.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.090
Now, look at the
shadow on the right.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.870
It doesn't make sense, right?

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.570
In fact, that square
shadow is impossible.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.200
I made it with software.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.440
And so it is with quantum
mechanics-- so much

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.940
of the quantum phenomena simply
just makes no sense at all.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.260
Here's one from
the Fermilab which

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.310
I thought was quite clever.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.910
Take a guess at what this jelly
bean jar is metaphorically

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:45.710
representing.

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.740
Take a moment.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.840
And the fact that it's from
Fermilab is a big hint.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.050
So here's that information
in a pie chart--

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.880
of course, more quantitative.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.080
We are seeing the distribution
of dark energy, dark matter,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.590
and everything else
in the universe.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:08.510
I think we pay more attention
to the jelly bean jar.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.810
Do you?

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.510
What do you think?

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.710
Now, none of these
visual metaphors

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.070
work completely on their own.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.540
First, we need some
sort of text to help

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.910
us look and think about it.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.530
And most important,
all metaphors

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.030
fall apart at some point.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.700
And that conversation
of where they fall apart

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.540
can be a powerful place
to talk about the science.

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.900
I encourage you
to start thinking

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.840
about creating metaphoric
photographs that

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.510
teach the non-expert
how to start

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:46.390
thinking about various
scientific phenomena.

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.890
OK.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.520
Let's switch gears
and look at just a few

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.380
simpler ways to engage the
public with our images.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.830
How about using some of
your new wonderful images

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.850
of your work for cards, or
announcements, or posters?

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:04.480
Could be fun thinking about it.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.940
The images you will begin
making after this course

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.630
will be pretty compelling.

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.110
I'm sure of it.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.780
Why not show them off outside
the research community?

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.420
All I suggest is
to think about ways

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.880
to incorporate some of
your amazing new images

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.910
in ways to excite the public.

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:25.320
And who knows?

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.410
Someday, you might
even get an exhibit

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.740
along the Champs-Elysees.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.510
What do you think?

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:21.935
PROFESSOR: We're
going to continue

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:26.520
our discussion of correlation
functions, and in particular,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.980
g2 of 0.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.780
If you think I'm focusing a
lot on one quantity, g2 of 0,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.290
that's correct.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.230
But I have to tell
you, I have been

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.400
involved in so many
discussions with people

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.670
who looked at g2 of 0 with
both Einstein condensates

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.890
when Bose-Einstein condensates
in [INAUDIBLE] were discovered

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.680
here at MIT by [INAUDIBLE]
and collaborators.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.230
There was some mystery about, in
essence, the g2 of 0 function.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.250
So a lot of physics
actually goes into it.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.610
And I've learned a lot
from my own research

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.030
and through discussions.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.830
And in this unit, I
want to summarize it.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.240
So the confusion sometimes
comes because people

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.920
use classical pictures,
quantum pictures,

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.010
and they may not
see the relation.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.435
So let's continue
the discussion.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.300
I want to go through
four different views

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.550
of the same physics
that you will

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.120
recognize that
they're interrelated.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.910
The first one, just
to repeat that,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.460
is if you have light which
is Gaussian intensity

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.690
fluctuations, light
from random sources.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.330
I think if you would look
at the twinkle of starlight,

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.120
if you look at the
light from a light bulb,

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.970
because of the
central limit theorem,

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.240
you will find that the intensity
that the electric field

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.575
has a Gaussian distribution,
and the intensity

00:02:02.575 --> 00:02:04.870
in exponential distribution.

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:12.540
And if you then ask, what is
g2 of 0, you'll find it's 2.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.480
Because for an
exponential distribution,

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.240
the average of the
intensity squared

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.660
is two times the intensity,
the average of the-- what

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.160
did I say.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.470
This average of the
squared intensity

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.695
is two times the average
of the intensity squared.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.560
Before I forget it, one
student asked me after class,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.170
I'm discussing g2 of 0,
but what about g2 of tau?

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.260
Well, my understanding is
that almost all of the physics

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.045
is in g2 of 0.

00:02:46.045 --> 00:02:51.640
And there is a simple number,
1 or 2, in those special cases.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.340
What happens is, if you have
completely independent sources,

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.600
if you completely
independent statistics,

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.335
then the probability of
finding a second particle,

00:03:02.335 --> 00:03:04.700
a second photon, is
independent of the first.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.670
So it means g2 of
tau would be unity.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.730
This is the case for an
uncoordinated system.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.210
But if you have g2 of 0 which is
higher, this means correlation.

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.100
This means some
form of coherence.

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.520
And usually, the
correlated value simply

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.840
decays to the uncorrelated value
with a characteristic coherence

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.730
time.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.830
And this characteristic
coherence time

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.880
can be inhomogeneous, technical.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.400
It can be limited by the Fourier
transform of a light pulse,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.610
the monochromaticity,
the bend which

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.990
delta omega is 1 over tau.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.450
So it has all of
the usual suspects

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.580
for what limits
the coherence time.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:51.230
So therefore in
general, we're not

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.740
learning something fundamental
in looking at g2 of tau.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.400
We're just learning the usual
spiel about correlation times

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.260
and coherence times.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.560
The second angle I gave you
with the brief interference

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.720
is something which
is deeply insightful.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.430
It shows you the following.

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:22.029
If you have a plane wave,
the intensity is constant.

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.640
If you have two plane
waves which interfere,

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.540
you create density fluctuations,
because the interference

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.660
pattern can be constructive
and can be destructive.

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.630
So therefore, if the
intensity fluctuates,

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.360
then i square average is
no longer i average square.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.060
And what happens is because
of the nature of interference,

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:53.240
because the average of
cosine square kx is-- well,

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.570
there are factors of 1/2
and 2 which just come out

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.580
of cosine and sine
square function.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.150
You get exactly g2 of 2.

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.780
But that should already
tell you something,

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.860
which will be important for both
quantum particles, and light,

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:10.600
and the classic limit.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.230
The moment if you have light or
particles in one single mode,

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:18.410
you can't have any
form of interference.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.150
Only two modes can interfere.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.940
And you will always
get a g2 function of 1.

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.490
But we'll come to
that in a second.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.328
Any questions at that point?

00:05:29.328 --> 00:05:29.828
Yes.

00:05:29.828 --> 00:05:32.369
AUDIENCE: I thought that when
we talked about the g2 function

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:36.946
several weeks ago, you said
that if we had a single mode

00:05:36.946 --> 00:05:39.850
thermal light, it would
have the g2 function of 2.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.000
And that's therefore,
all we were

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.370
using for lasers when we
used them in experiments

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:53.700
is the fact that it's single
mode, not the coherence

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.885
in the g2 function.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.090
PROFESSOR: You have a good--
that's a good point, Cory.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.400
Let's just try to
connect the two pictures.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.430
Slowly, slowly.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.660
What did we discuss?

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.110
This question is great for
me to repeat something.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.070
When we looked at
black body radiation,

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.050
I wrote down the
partition function.

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.650
And I said I'm only
considering a single mode.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:43.670
And then, we have of course
in thermal equilibrium

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.680
a Boltzmann type, or
Bose-Einstein type,

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.890
distribution of finding
certain numbers,

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:55.800
number of photons
populating the single mode.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.915
And that resulted in
a g2 function of 2.

00:07:11.792 --> 00:07:13.958
AUDIENCE: It's not really
single mode though, right?

00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.025
Because you're summing
over many frequencies.

00:07:16.025 --> 00:07:17.650
PROFESSOR: No, it
was single frequency.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.190
I have to think about it.

00:07:26.190 --> 00:07:28.090
That's a really good question.

00:07:28.090 --> 00:07:32.562
Right now, I would quickly
say, in thermal equilibrium--

00:07:32.562 --> 00:07:34.895
I'll give you partial answer,
and when I think about it,

00:07:34.895 --> 00:07:38.960
I'll give you full
answer on Friday

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.430
at the beginning
of the next class--

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:43.080
I think would be
calculated where

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.150
the thermal fluctuations
in the intensity.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.515
And the intensity fluctuations,
and those intensity

00:07:48.515 --> 00:07:49.056
fluctuations.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.585
Those intensity fluctuations
result in a g2 function of 2.

00:07:57.585 --> 00:07:58.210
That's correct.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.780
Maybe what I want
you to say here

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:09.470
is, if you have two modes
which have all maybe

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:11.720
single occupation or
constant occupation,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.340
and they interfere, then they
create a spatial interference

00:08:15.340 --> 00:08:18.930
pattern if the phase between
the two modes is random,

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:22.340
which gives rise to
additional fluctuation.

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:27.890
So most likely, the two
fluctuations are independent.

00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:30.470
One is the fluctuations
because of the interference

00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.630
of two modes.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:37.000
But when I say the single
mode has a g2 function of 1,

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.565
I meant actually a single
mode with constant amplitude.

00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.964
I'll double check and give you a
more complete answer on Friday.

00:08:45.964 --> 00:08:46.630
Other questions?

00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:51.270
OK.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:07.255
The third view is classical
versus quantum statistics.

00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:28.200
And I think this really
shows that we need at least

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.515
some quantumness to
find correlations.

00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:39.070
Let's assume we
have n particles.

00:09:39.070 --> 00:09:42.105
And we have N possible states.

00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:57.060
And if it's a
classical system, let's

00:09:57.060 --> 00:10:04.270
assume we want to find one
particle in a certain state.

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:07.220
We have a big box and want
to-- we have a big box,

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:08.990
have a small
sub-volume, and say what

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.440
is the probability of
finding one particle here?

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:21.960
So this probability
to find one particle

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:31.190
is P1 is small n over big
N. The probability to find

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.900
two particles.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:41.770
If you have non-interacting
classical particles,

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:43.670
well, it's simply P1 squared.

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.000
Independent classical
particles, they

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.560
don't care what they are doing.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.810
You grab into a
sub-volume, which

00:10:52.810 --> 00:10:54.220
is maybe phase space cell.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:55.770
And therefore,
your quantum state,

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.360
you have probability
P of finding one.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.820
But since each particle
moves around independently,

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:06.180
the probability to find two
particles is just P squared.

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.566
It's a little bit like if
you toss two coins, one

00:11:08.566 --> 00:11:10.190
with your left and
one with your right,

00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:11.690
and you ask what
is the probability

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:15.285
to find a head or
tail, and you simply

00:11:15.285 --> 00:11:16.410
multiply the probabilities.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:24.880
But now, following reasonings
which Bose and Einstein

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:31.180
introduced, you want to use
counting statistics, which

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.860
takes into account the
indistinguishability

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.595
of particles.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:45.490
So if we go from the
classical distribution

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:53.360
to the distribution of
indistinguishable particles,

00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:08.190
then the classical probability
P 1 is reduced by n factorial,

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:19.040
because we are not--
let me put it this way.

00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:20.805
The number-- I don't
want to go through

00:12:20.805 --> 00:12:23.040
a mathematical argument.

00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:33.240
If you grab one particle,
it can be the probability

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.880
to find one particle
is represented

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.090
by a microconfiguration
classically.

00:12:42.090 --> 00:12:45.630
And each configuration
when you permute particles

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.500
counts as independent.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.180
But if you have quantum
indistinguishability,

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:53.750
you're not counting
permutations as

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.580
an independent configuration.

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.325
And therefore, you have a
reduction by n factorial.

00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.960
If you look at the probability
of finding two particles,

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:09.300
the reduction is-- this is
just the counting statistics

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.100
n factorial by 2.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:20.500
So therefore, you will find
that classically, that quantum

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:33.240
mechanically for
bosons, is two times.

00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:50.930
The probability to find two
bosons in one quantum state

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:56.260
is two times the probability
squared to find one boson.

00:13:56.260 --> 00:13:57.845
So this is just
counting statistics.

00:14:03.990 --> 00:14:09.870
This can be applied
to conditions

00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:12.350
in a Bose-Einstein
in a Bose gas.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.730
When you have inelastic
collisions, spin relaxation,

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:34.620
dipolar collisions,
two body collisions,

00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:37.560
two-body collisions
have a rate gamma 2,

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.280
which is proportional to
the probability of finding

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:45.297
two particles at the same
time at the same location.

00:14:45.297 --> 00:14:46.755
And that brings in
the g2 function.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:58.350
Whereas three-body
collisions, gamma 3,

00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:01.300
reflects the third
order correlation

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.890
function g3, which is
defined in an analogous way.

00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:18.730
So if you now compare
at the same density

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:25.060
the two-body rate coefficient,
like the same density

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.340
means we are looking at the
rate of two-body collisions.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:35.630
And we compare between
two-body collision

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.500
in a thermal cloud, which
is a g2 factor of two,

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:41.780
a thermal cloud of bosons.

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.660
Whereas a Bose-Einstein
condensate

00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.330
is a constant occupation
of particles in one mode

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:51.670
and has therefore a g2 factor
of 1, exactly as [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:53.500
of the Bose-Einstein
condensate is

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.960
for particles for meta waves,
but the laser is for light.

00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:03.040
Whereas, if you look at
three-body collisions,

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.730
those who do experiments with
Bose-Einstein condensates

00:16:05.730 --> 00:16:07.930
will know that
usually the lifetime

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.589
of Bose-Einstein
condensates is limited

00:16:09.589 --> 00:16:10.630
by three-body collisions.

00:16:13.670 --> 00:16:18.290
Well, I didn't derive
it, but actually

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:20.880
yes, we have the Gaussian
statistics for randomness.

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:26.380
For Gaussian statistics, the
n-body collision function

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.580
has a factor of n factorial.

00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:31.700
So therefore,
three-body collisions

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:36.300
scale with 3 factorial, and
two-body collisions with 2

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.930
factorial.

00:16:37.930 --> 00:16:40.090
So in other words, you
have a thermal cloud,

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:43.180
you have a Bose-Einstein
condensate at the same density.

00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.470
But what matters for
two-body collision

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:47.790
is not the average density.

00:16:47.790 --> 00:16:50.240
It is the average of n square.

00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.750
And the fluctuations
in the thermal cloud

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:56.110
because of the g2 function
are two times enhanced

00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:59.290
compared to
Bose-Einstein condensate.

00:16:59.290 --> 00:17:02.130
And therefore, you find
that at the same density,

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.047
you have more loss.

00:17:03.047 --> 00:17:05.380
You have a higher rate of two
and three-body collisions.

00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:30.280
Some of this was not--
became better understood

00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:42.530
soon after Bose-Einstein
condensates were realized.

00:17:42.530 --> 00:17:45.950
The Boulder group studied
three-body collisions.

00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:54.350
And for two-body
collisions, myself

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:57.210
in the post-doc
clarified the situation

00:17:57.210 --> 00:18:01.960
that even the mean field energy,
which everybody had measured

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:06.490
before, requires two particles
to interact with short range

00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:09.930
interaction is therefore
proportional to g2.

00:18:09.930 --> 00:18:12.320
And therefore, when people
had determined the mean field

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.870
energy of a condensate
without really knowing

00:18:14.870 --> 00:18:16.752
they had already
determined the g2 function

00:18:16.752 --> 00:18:17.960
of Bose-Einstein condensates.

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.880
OK, so this is pretty much
the counting statistic

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.220
which you do in
undergraduate class

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:42.520
when you derive the three
different statistics--

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.150
Boltzmann statistics,
Bose-Einstein statistics, Fermi

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:46.410
statistics.

00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:54.000
And it gives you the result
of that is also for bosons,

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.750
you have the factor of 2.

00:18:55.750 --> 00:18:57.830
For fermions, of
course, you get 0.

00:18:57.830 --> 00:19:02.630
The average between bosons
2 and fermions 0 is 1.

00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:06.330
And this is the
classical statistics.

00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:06.935
Any questions?

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:25.370
Then let me finish
this discussion

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:30.625
with a quantum
mechanical description.

00:19:39.010 --> 00:19:47.430
If you describe the
detection or collision of two

00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:54.985
particles in two modes.

00:19:58.260 --> 00:19:59.960
So you have mode.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.390
A mode operator, annihilation
operator a1 you and a2.

00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:06.920
But if you are
asking what happens

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.580
if I measure two particles,
you annihilate two particles

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:13.300
with an operator a1 and a2.

00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:16.130
But then, because of
the indistinguishability

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:22.350
of particles, you
have to consider

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:27.600
an exchange term, which is a2a1.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.440
So whenever you
detect two particles

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.520
in two different
modes, your signal

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.370
is proportional to something
related to a1a2 plus a2a1.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:50.050
This extra exchange term
gives you an extra factor of 2

00:20:50.050 --> 00:20:55.140
for bosons, which is
exactly what appears

00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:58.760
in the g2 function.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:06.960
And, of course, if you have
an exchange term for fermions,

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.930
you get 0.

00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:13.640
And this, of course,
leads to the antibunching,

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:19.610
or the g2 value
of 0 for fermions.

00:21:23.610 --> 00:21:36.450
However, and this is obvious,
if you have a single mode,

00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:42.470
then the only operator to detect
two particles is a1 times a1.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:44.910
And this has no exchange term.

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.560
And this is the
situation of the laser

00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.440
and the Bose-Einstein
condensate.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:02.870
And that means they
have a g2 function of 1.

00:22:07.290 --> 00:22:09.250
So Cory, this is
another argument

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:14.310
why single mode occupation
has a g2 function of 1.

00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:17.600
But I have to reconcile
it with your question.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.540
Right now, I think
there may be difference

00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:23.420
between a canonical ensemble
and grand canonical ensemble.

00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:31.730
In a canonical ensemble,
we have [INAUDIBLE]

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.370
the total particle
number is fixed.

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:35.230
But in a grand
canonical it fluctuates.

00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.380
And maybe this leads to
additional fluctuations

00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.850
for the case of a single
mode chaotic light.

00:22:41.850 --> 00:22:44.710
But I will have to think
about it, your question.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.860
But here is the
same argument why

00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:50.132
if you occupy only a
single mode-- if you look,

00:22:50.132 --> 00:22:51.965
for instance, at a
Bose-Einstein condensate,

00:22:51.965 --> 00:22:55.940
you do not have the
second exchange term.

00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:58.604
And the missing
exchange term just

00:22:58.604 --> 00:23:00.520
propagates through the
equations and gives you

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.840
the g2 factor, the
g2 function of 1.

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:14.510
OK so let me sort of wrap it up.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:17.920
I've given you different
angles at the g2 function.

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:22.180
Some are simply classical
intensity distribution.

00:23:22.180 --> 00:23:26.460
Some is simply interference.

00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:31.030
Another aspect is Poissonian
counting statistics.

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:33.120
My understanding and
my interpretation

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:37.200
is they look as different
as they can possibly look,

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.300
but they reflect
the same physics.

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:45.540
Because interference of to
light only happens because light

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:46.535
consists of photons.

00:23:46.535 --> 00:23:48.210
And photons are bosons.

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.330
So the classical
interference and

00:23:50.330 --> 00:23:57.350
the quantum mechanical
counting of bosons

00:23:57.350 --> 00:24:03.190
lead not for random reasons,
but lead for profound reasons

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:05.100
to the same result.

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:08.850
And chaotic light, which
seems to be determined

00:24:08.850 --> 00:24:11.480
by just random
fluctuation, well,

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.690
the random fluctuations
if you have single mode

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:18.250
light, a thermal distribution
of single mode photons,

00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:19.980
comes from random phases.

00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.917
And these random phases
lead to random interference.

00:24:22.917 --> 00:24:24.375
And so we are back
to interference.

00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:41.830
Finally, let me give you my
view on the measurements of g2.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:47.830
When you look through
the literature,

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:51.170
you find the famous Henry
[INAUDIBLE] experiment.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.960
In one of your
homework assignments,

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:58.030
you looked at a
seminal experiment

00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.700
where people dropped atoms
out of cold atom clouds

00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:04.470
and measured the g2
function for cold atoms.

00:25:08.250 --> 00:25:11.330
Sometimes it's confusing
when you directly

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:12.530
compare the two experiments.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:20.460
But let me try to give
you a common description,

00:25:20.460 --> 00:25:28.160
or the common denominator,
between all these experiments.

00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:40.000
You can say that all experiments
to measure the two particle

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.610
correlation function
is about comparing

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:47.910
the probability of finding two
particles with a probability

00:25:47.910 --> 00:25:49.170
of finding one particle.

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:58.290
And well, you restrict your
measurement, your detection

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:06.020
of particles, to
either one quantum

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:20.950
state, one mode of the
electromagnetic field, one

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:26.420
coherence length, or
coherence volume, of light.

00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.760
Or if you use the semi-classical
argument for the description

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:36.660
of particles, you take
one phase space cell.

00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:40.125
This is one phase space cell,
one mode, one coherence volume,

00:26:40.125 --> 00:26:49.400
one quantum state, is sort
of the different definitions

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.740
of what a quantum state
is, or what a wave packet

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.610
is with Heisenberg
limited uncertainty.

00:26:56.610 --> 00:27:01.820
You cannot define a particle
in phase space to within better

00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:05.660
than the phase space
volume of a quantum state,

00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:09.686
which is h square.

00:27:09.686 --> 00:27:10.310
Or is it h bar?

00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:14.430
I don't think there
is a bar-- h square.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:17.020
And so this is how you
can relate wave packets

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:19.480
to quantum states to
phase space volume.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:24.800
It's pretty much mathematically
I could say in different basis

00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:29.810
sets, in different basis
sets, it is one quantum state.

00:27:29.810 --> 00:27:31.230
But you can use wave packets.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:33.550
You can use time
dependent description.

00:27:33.550 --> 00:27:36.770
But what I said here--
one quantum state,

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:38.960
one mode, one
coherence volume-- this

00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:42.420
is as well as you can
define a particle or photon

00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:47.220
to be by fundamental reasons
by Heisenberg's uncertainty

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:48.372
relation.

00:27:48.372 --> 00:27:50.714
AUDIENCE: What do you mean
by one coherence volume?

00:27:50.714 --> 00:27:51.380
PROFESSOR: What?

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:54.100
AUDIENCE: What do we mean
by one coherence volume?

00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:56.930
PROFESSOR: Well, if you have
a laser beam which propagates,

00:27:56.930 --> 00:28:01.770
and it is TEM00, you would say
the transverse coherence volume

00:28:01.770 --> 00:28:04.020
is the size of the
laser beam but then

00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:05.870
the longitudinal
coherence volume

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:09.150
is given by the
coherence length.

00:28:09.150 --> 00:28:11.880
Just envision you have
a laser beam here.

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:17.730
And the coherence volume where
all of the photons are coherent

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:22.790
is the area of the laser beam
times the coherence length.

00:28:22.790 --> 00:28:26.930
And whenever you find a
photon in this kind of volume,

00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:30.860
then it is in a
Heisenberg Uncertainty

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.830
limited or
Fourier-limited state.

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:37.600
It is in, if it's a wave
packet and pulse laser,

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.650
it's in a time
dependent quantum state.

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.236
But it is as coherent.

00:28:42.236 --> 00:28:43.110
It is fully coherent.

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.270
So you have to figure
out for your system what

00:28:48.270 --> 00:28:59.050
is this minimum-- what is the
coherence volume, what defines

00:28:59.050 --> 00:29:03.890
the fundamental phase
space cell of your system?

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.710
And now you do the following.

00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.210
You are asking, what
is the probability

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:10.950
to find two particles?

00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:15.110
And what is the probability
to find one particle?

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:29.090
So if p is the probability
to find one particle,

00:29:29.090 --> 00:29:36.260
then you have three options.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:43.765
p square, 2 p square or
0 to find two particles.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.960
One is the classical case
of distinguishable particle.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:56.200
This is the case of bosons,
bosonic atoms or photons.

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.970
Collins Therefore includes the
Hanbury Brown-Twiss experiment.

00:29:59.970 --> 00:30:01.050
And 0 is fermions.

00:30:06.450 --> 00:30:13.460
And the question is now
different experiments,

00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.090
how do you define,
with spatial resolution

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:20.560
or temporal resolution,
the coherence volume?

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.740
And that can involve
transverse coordination,

00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.860
temporal resolution,
and whatever

00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:34.690
you can use to define
the phase space

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:38.500
cell or the coherence links,
the coherence volume of a laser

00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:39.050
beam.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:43.070
Let me give you one example,
which I think illustrates it.

00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:46.260
And this is the example
of an atom cloud.

00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:52.530
If you have an atom
cloud, all the particles

00:30:52.530 --> 00:30:55.950
which are in a volume of a
thermal de Broglie wavelengths

00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:56.510
are coherent.

00:31:04.970 --> 00:31:07.830
The momentum uncertainty of
particles in a thermal cloud

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.590
is 1 over the thermal--
is the thermal momentum.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:14.810
And according to Heisenberg,
the position uncertainty

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:16.770
related with this
momentum spread

00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:19.160
is just the thermal de
Broglie wavelengths.

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.470
So you can say that all the
atoms in a cubic de Broglie

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:27.460
wavelengths are coherent.

00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:33.130
All the atoms are in one
semi-classical quantum state.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:38.460
So therefore, this is sort
of atoms in one single mode.

00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:42.470
So the Hanbury Brown-Twiss
experiment with atoms,

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:44.750
or the measurement
of the g2 function,

00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.720
could be defined as follows.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.160
You have an atom cloud.

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.010
And if you had an
electron microscope

00:31:51.010 --> 00:31:55.470
or some high resolution device,
you grab into your cloud

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.890
and ask, what is the
probability for one particle.

00:31:57.890 --> 00:31:59.910
What is the probability
for two particles?

00:31:59.910 --> 00:32:05.730
And you will find that
p2 is 2 times p1 squared.

00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:09.250
If your volume is too big,
you lose the factor of 2,

00:32:09.250 --> 00:32:11.455
because you average over
uncorrelated volumes.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:20.410
Now, in your homework, you
were looking at the question,

00:32:20.410 --> 00:32:23.060
how can I really
grab into a cloud

00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:25.752
and just pick out atoms
out of one phase space

00:32:25.752 --> 00:32:28.970
cell of effective size,
lambda de Broglie cubed?

00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:49.080
And the way how it was done
is that you take an atom cloud

00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:55.220
and you drop it and expand it.

00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:59.260
When the cloud expands, there
is a mapping from momentum space

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.200
into position space.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:21.120
Then you use some
form of pinhole,

00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:23.695
which provides
transverse coordination.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:44.745
You use a detection laser, which
gives you temporal resolution.

00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:52.160
And well, this was
part of your homework,

00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.110
but I just wanted to give
you the bird's view on it.

00:33:57.110 --> 00:34:00.160
By controlling the
transverse correlation

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.850
and the temporal resolution
of the detection,

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:08.580
you create a situation that
what you count only atoms which

00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:12.940
originated from one phase
space cell in your cloud.

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.010
So in other words,
let's say experiment

00:34:15.010 --> 00:34:16.949
where without
electron microscope,

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:20.110
without submicron
spatial resolution,

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:23.080
you can literally
grab into a cloud,

00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:26.170
capture a volume of the
thermal de Broglie wavelengths,

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:28.420
open your hand,
and figure out how

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:30.510
is the probability for
two particles related

00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.604
to the probability of
finding one particle.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:37.565
Any questions?

00:34:47.699 --> 00:34:48.199
All right.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.370
OK, good.

00:35:18.370 --> 00:35:28.740
So it's time for new chapter.

00:35:49.870 --> 00:35:52.320
So in this chapter,
we want to look

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:55.370
at interactions
between light and atoms

00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:57.710
using Feynman diagrams.

00:35:57.710 --> 00:36:03.180
And I know this part of the
course is a little bit formal.

00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:09.110
We are using exact solutions
for the time evolution

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:11.330
operator in quantum physics.

00:36:11.330 --> 00:36:17.470
But I'm not doing it to teach
you sophisticated formalism.

00:36:17.470 --> 00:36:20.450
Well, it's interesting
to learn it anyway.

00:36:20.450 --> 00:36:26.310
But it is this picture
of really writing down

00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:32.730
the exact solution of the
time evolution operator, which

00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:38.140
helped me to understand much
better what virtual states are,

00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:41.060
what certain
virtual photons are.

00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.870
So there are things we
talk about it all the time.

00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:46.730
And the question is, how do
you define a virtual state?

00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:49.690
What is the virtual
emission of a photon?

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:53.420
And the only way how I can
really explain it to you

00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:56.090
is by showing you the
equation and say look,

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:01.020
the virtual photon is just
a term in this equation.

00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:04.530
So that's the goal
of this chapter.

00:37:04.530 --> 00:37:08.300
I don't want to overemphasize
the mathematical rigor,

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.210
but I want to
really show you what

00:37:10.210 --> 00:37:13.070
it means to have
virtual photons and what

00:37:13.070 --> 00:37:16.160
exactly virtual states are.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:35.460
So let me first motivate that by
reminding you of two diagrams.

00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.650
In physics, we always
like to draw something--

00:37:37.650 --> 00:37:39.450
a few lines, a few doodles.

00:37:39.450 --> 00:37:44.880
And when we have a
two level system,

00:37:44.880 --> 00:37:49.690
we have the two processes which
are emission and absorption.

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:07.010
Well, so this is easy as long
as the light is in resonance.

00:38:07.010 --> 00:38:16.170
But if the light is
not in resonance,

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:25.390
we may ask what
about this process?

00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:34.840
And since somehow the weekly
line of the photon ends here,

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:37.700
I may even put in a
dashed line and say,

00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.610
this is a virtual state.

00:38:39.610 --> 00:38:43.030
What does it mean?

00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:48.020
Or we can even ask,
is it possible--

00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:51.720
I'm just playing with straight
lines which are quantum state

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:55.110
and wiggly lines--
is it possible

00:38:55.110 --> 00:38:56.470
that this process happens.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.690
That would actually mean that
an atom in the ground state,

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:06.720
just out of the
blue, emits a photon.

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.230
Can that happen?

00:39:08.230 --> 00:39:10.060
And I can again
draw a dashed line

00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:11.590
and say, here's a virtual state.

00:39:14.190 --> 00:39:19.070
Or, we can say we start
in the excited state.

00:39:19.070 --> 00:39:24.560
The atom is in
the excited state.

00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:27.730
But can the atom-- its
a two level system,

00:39:27.730 --> 00:39:31.100
so we don't include higher
states-- but can a two level

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:39.130
atom in the excited state
absorb another photon?

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:53.540
So let me just change the
color of these photons

00:39:53.540 --> 00:40:09.656
to red, because I want to--
and this would remain black.

00:40:14.540 --> 00:40:17.211
All right.

00:40:17.211 --> 00:40:17.710
Good.

00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:19.630
So question is, are
those processes possible?

00:40:24.690 --> 00:40:25.660
Yes or no?

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.540
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.710
PROFESSOR: Yes, they are.

00:40:28.710 --> 00:40:34.550
And they have experimental,
observable consequences.

00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:38.380
However, they look
funny because something

00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:41.580
seems to be strange with
energy conservation.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:45.360
And what we will see
is that in the end,

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.050
at the end of the
day, that means

00:40:48.050 --> 00:40:55.220
if you let the system evolve for
a long time, after a long time,

00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:59.655
energy has to be conserved.

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:15.930
And therefore, we will
always need a second photon

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.205
to conserve energy.

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.690
So those weirder
processes, where

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.760
photons are emitted
by ground states out

00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.620
of the blue or excited
states absorb other photons

00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:38.692
without-- also, there is
no higher lying state.

00:41:38.692 --> 00:41:40.025
That looks a little bit strange.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:45.250
So what you will
see is-- and I want

00:41:45.250 --> 00:41:47.410
to show you that
mathematically--

00:41:47.410 --> 00:41:53.790
if an atom emits a photon
out of the ground state,

00:41:53.790 --> 00:41:56.050
you would say, where does
the energy come from.

00:41:56.050 --> 00:42:03.510
But quantum mechanic allows us
to violate energy conservation

00:42:03.510 --> 00:42:07.840
by an amount delta e for a time
which is h bar over delta e.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:11.290
So for short movement,
energy can be violated.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.015
But then, you need
the second photon

00:42:13.015 --> 00:42:15.330
to reconcile energy
conservation.

00:42:15.330 --> 00:42:18.242
You can violate energy
only for short times.

00:42:18.242 --> 00:42:19.950
And if you would say,
what does it really

00:42:19.950 --> 00:42:22.910
mean to violate energy
conservation for short times?

00:42:22.910 --> 00:42:25.180
Well, I want to show
you the equation,

00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.940
which exactly explains
what it means.

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:39.150
Next question, just to see.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:42.490
If you have an excited
state, and you just

00:42:42.490 --> 00:42:46.580
say it's possible to
absorb another atom,

00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:51.000
you are in the excited state,
and you absorb another photon.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.470
And at least you said,
yes this is possible.

00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:56.080
My question is, when you
are in the excited state

00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:59.980
and absorb a photon, in which
quantum state is the atom

00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.926
after absorbing a photon?

00:43:02.926 --> 00:43:04.012
AUDIENCE: Ground state.

00:43:04.012 --> 00:43:04.762
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

00:43:04.762 --> 00:43:05.720
AUDIENCE: Ground state.

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:08.460
PROFESSOR: In the ground state.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:09.090
Yes.

00:43:09.090 --> 00:43:10.710
There is no other state.

00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:13.610
And the operator--
and I want to show you

00:43:13.610 --> 00:43:16.930
that-- when photons
are exchanged,

00:43:16.930 --> 00:43:19.904
always transforms the
ground to the excited state,

00:43:19.904 --> 00:43:21.320
because a dipole
operator connects

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.140
the ground to the excited state.

00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:27.660
So therefore-- but we'll see
that all in the time evolution

00:43:27.660 --> 00:43:32.600
operator in the formal solution
that this dash line is actually

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:34.500
the ground state.

00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.650
And while it's not obvious,
what is this dash line?

00:43:36.650 --> 00:43:37.580
AUDIENCE: The excited state.

00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.038
PROFESSOR: It is
the excited state.

00:43:39.038 --> 00:43:42.050
The atom in the ground
state emits a photon.

00:43:42.050 --> 00:43:44.730
Therefore, the atomic
system has now lower energy,

00:43:44.730 --> 00:43:46.960
because a photon
has been emitted.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:50.480
But the character of this
state is now the excited state.

00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:58.810
So we will later see that this
means that in a perturbation

00:43:58.810 --> 00:44:01.280
analysis, we are
violating energy.

00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:04.390
We are violating energy,
because the real excited

00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:11.460
state is omega photon plus
omega atom, the resonant energy

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.190
for the atom.

00:44:12.190 --> 00:44:17.200
The real excited state is omega
photon plus omega atom higher.

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:21.560
So you will actually find that
in a perturbation analysis,

00:44:21.560 --> 00:44:25.590
this term has an energy
denominator, which

00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:31.490
is of resonant by
exactly this separation.

00:44:31.490 --> 00:44:34.720
And this term, because the
real count state is here,

00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.550
the virtual state here which
is the count state is here,

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:42.210
has actually the same energy
denominator as that state.

00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:43.790
And for this state,
of course, this

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:46.060
is something you've seen of
resonant light scattering.

00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.842
The energy
[? denominator ?] is there.

00:44:52.470 --> 00:45:04.050
So, OK.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:12.800
So I'll explain to you that
we involve virtual states.

00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:18.920
So when we have
virtual states, we

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:26.370
want to clarify what
is their energy.

00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:28.890
But we discussed that
already in the discussion.

00:45:28.890 --> 00:45:33.560
And what is the wave function,
ground or excited state.

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:39.450
Yes.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.700
So just to repeat it, when
we draw those diagrams,

00:45:54.700 --> 00:46:02.150
those diagrams show
the energy of the atom,

00:46:02.150 --> 00:46:09.080
but taking into account
the energy of the photon.

00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:14.790
In other words, if you
have a ground state,

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:18.820
and we absorb a photon,
the photon has disappeared,

00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:21.070
and the energy of
the atom is now

00:46:21.070 --> 00:46:22.820
the ground state and
the photon energy.

00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:24.780
And this is a dashed line.

00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:29.360
Similarly, when an atom emits
a photon in the ground state,

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.020
the photon is emitted.

00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:35.400
Therefore, the atomic energy
is lower than the ground state

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.980
by the photon energy.

00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.490
And we draw the
dashed line here.

00:46:39.490 --> 00:46:43.070
This is what we mean
when we say that is

00:46:43.070 --> 00:46:45.009
the energy of the virtual state.

00:46:45.009 --> 00:46:46.800
And this is what we
draw in those diagrams.

00:46:50.170 --> 00:46:53.660
By the way, yesterday
we had the CUA seminar.

00:46:53.660 --> 00:46:59.880
And the speaker was actually
talking about trapping atoms

00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.750
with quantum fluctuations.

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:06.380
And he conceded
explicitly Casimir forces,

00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.000
forces of the vacuum.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.780
And diagrammatically,
forces of the vacuum

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.880
come, because the ground state
atom emits a virtual photon

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.000
and reabsorbs.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.810
This is actually, I
will mention it later,

00:47:19.810 --> 00:47:21.270
the same diagram
is actually also

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:23.060
the diagram which leads
to the Lamb shift.

00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:26.810
These are all sort of when you
have atoms in the lowest state,

00:47:26.810 --> 00:47:29.450
and they interact with
the electromagnetic field.

00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:31.740
Well, if they interact
with the vacuum,

00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.140
they cannot absorb photon.

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:38.350
All we can do is emit a photon,
and this leads to this diagram.

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.780
But just to tell you that
you have to be careful,

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:45.020
yesterday's speakers
actually used this process.

00:47:45.020 --> 00:47:46.240
But he drew this diagram.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.930
He drew it in the
opposite way, which

00:47:48.930 --> 00:47:51.650
I think confused some
people in the audience.

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:54.430
The correct way is
to draw it like this.

00:47:54.430 --> 00:47:59.440
The virtual state for
vacuum fluctuations

00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.880
for the Lamb shift
for the Casimir force

00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.970
is below the current state.

00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:17.610
OK, so we have-- let me just
redraw those three diagrams.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:27.840
I want to now introduce
the time evolution.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.165
So I want to use those.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.235
Seems I'm running out of space.

00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:57.000
So we want to
introduce the time axis

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:04.830
for-- so we had this diagram.

00:49:04.830 --> 00:49:08.480
We had this diagram.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:21.100
And we had-- this
is a virtual state.

00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:22.290
OK.

00:49:22.290 --> 00:49:32.090
So those three
diagrams correspond

00:49:32.090 --> 00:49:33.340
to the following situation.

00:49:37.690 --> 00:49:42.860
If time evolves from
the bottom to the top,

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.010
we can now draw
the first process

00:49:46.010 --> 00:49:48.300
when atom in the
ground state first

00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.790
absorbs and then emits a photon.

00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:08.250
And let's label the second
photon in the purple color.

00:50:08.250 --> 00:50:12.260
So an atom starts out
in the ground state.

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:14.980
Then it reaches
the time where it

00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:17.860
interacts the
electromagnetic field.

00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:21.320
There is a photon
which propagates

00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:27.060
from earlier times to this
time, t equals t prime.

00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:30.940
At the time t prime,
the photon disappears.

00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:36.440
And the atom, which was
in the ground state,

00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:38.980
goes to the excited state.

00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:42.690
It may propagate in the
excited state for a while.

00:50:42.690 --> 00:50:48.470
And then it emits the photon and
is back into the ground state.

00:50:48.470 --> 00:50:52.730
So this is the temporal
diagram for this process.

00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:59.640
For the next situation,
we also start

00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.540
with an atom in
the ground state.

00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:06.980
But now we have the
situation that a photon

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.980
is emitted by the ground state.

00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:17.220
As a result, the atom
switches to the excited state.

00:51:17.220 --> 00:51:23.780
Strong violation of energy,
but possible for short times.

00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:31.780
Then there is a real photon,
which is now absorbed,

00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.030
absorbed by an atom
in the excited state.

00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:39.520
And that takes us back
down to the ground state.

00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:43.560
And finally, in
the third scenario,

00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:45.850
we have an atom in
the excited state.

00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:52.650
There is a real photon
which is absorbed

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:56.290
that switches the atom
into the ground state.

00:51:56.290 --> 00:52:03.210
And then the atom in the
ground state emits a photon.

00:52:03.210 --> 00:52:06.440
And as a result, it is
back in the excited state.

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:32.160
So let me just make a note
that when a ground state

00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:47.290
atom absorbs a photon, this
is the co-rotating term

00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:53.390
in the quantum description,
which a lot of you have seen.

00:52:53.390 --> 00:53:01.460
The opposite process of
emitting a virtual photon-- I

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:05.060
shouldn't say virtual photon.

00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:05.940
It's a photon.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:09.050
What makes it virtual
we will see later

00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:12.010
when we have the more accurate
mathematical formulation.

00:53:12.010 --> 00:53:14.660
So this is a
counter-rotating term.

00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:34.890
And we have used the rule
that every photon, which

00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:40.250
with a real or virtual-- every
photon which is interchanged

00:53:40.250 --> 00:53:42.950
with the atom
absorbs or emitted--

00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:48.910
changes the atomic state
from ground to excited.

00:53:48.910 --> 00:53:52.660
So an atom goes from the
ground to the excited state

00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:55.810
either by photon absorption
or by photon emission.

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:56.800
Both is possible.

00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:04.130
So whenever photon
appears or disappears,

00:54:04.130 --> 00:54:07.000
it changes-- let's say we
start in the ground state.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.030
We go to the excited state.

00:54:09.030 --> 00:54:15.060
And this is possible
by photon absorption--

00:54:15.060 --> 00:54:18.485
this is a co-rotating
term-- or emission.

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:27.490
What I've just said
reflects that when

00:54:27.490 --> 00:54:32.910
we derived the
dipole approximation,

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:40.330
that the essential term of the
dipole operator is of diagonal.

00:54:40.330 --> 00:54:42.110
The dipole operator
is an operator

00:54:42.110 --> 00:54:44.770
between calm and excited state.

00:54:44.770 --> 00:54:51.180
Therefore, it has those
two matrix elements.

00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:56.700
Whereas electric field
operator is the equation

00:54:56.700 --> 00:55:00.550
and annihilation
operator a and a dagger.

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:05.410
Or which is very elegant
if I use for the two level

00:55:05.410 --> 00:55:08.160
system a spin one
half description.

00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:11.030
And I use sigma plus
and sigma minus,

00:55:11.030 --> 00:55:12.890
raising and lowering operator.

00:55:12.890 --> 00:55:15.980
Sigma plus takes the ground
state to the excited state.

00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:19.090
Sigma minus takes the exciting
state to the ground state.

00:55:19.090 --> 00:55:23.230
Then in the fundamental
atom light interaction,

00:55:23.230 --> 00:55:25.770
we have those four terms.

00:55:25.770 --> 00:55:30.030
And now you see that
sigma plus takes the atom

00:55:30.030 --> 00:55:33.720
from the calm to
the excited state.

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.850
But sigma plus appears
both with photon absorption

00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:39.640
and with photon emission.

00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.866
So therefore, the
atom can-- this

00:55:41.866 --> 00:55:43.490
is what the quantum
mechanical operator

00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:46.430
tells us-- go from the
ground to the excited state

00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:51.170
either by photon absorption
or by photon emission.

00:55:54.992 --> 00:55:55.575
Any questions?

00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:01.834
Yes.

00:56:01.834 --> 00:56:04.567
AUDIENCE: So if we were
to look beyond the dipole

00:56:04.567 --> 00:56:09.289
approximation, would
we see transitions

00:56:09.289 --> 00:56:11.277
that leave the
[INAUDIBLE] state?

00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:22.700
PROFESSOR: Yes or no.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:25.270
What we need here is a
bilinear interaction,

00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:28.920
which has an raising and
lowering operator for the atom.

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.100
And here it has a
raising and lowering atom

00:56:31.100 --> 00:56:33.490
operator for the photon number.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:37.930
And it has the co-rotating
term where you raise here

00:56:37.930 --> 00:56:39.350
and you lower there.

00:56:39.350 --> 00:56:41.040
You lower here and
you raise there.

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:45.110
But it has also terms where you
raise the atomic excitation,

00:56:45.110 --> 00:56:47.470
and you raise the
photon number by one,

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:49.480
which of course violates energy.

00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:52.870
But the message I want
to give you is this

00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:54.250
is possible for short times.

00:56:54.250 --> 00:56:58.190
And this is exactly what the
quantum mechanical equations

00:56:58.190 --> 00:57:00.460
tell us.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:02.540
So the short answer
to your question

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:05.090
is, as long as we
describe the system

00:57:05.090 --> 00:57:09.100
by the dipole interaction,
or what we have even beyond--

00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.900
I'm not using a
perturbation argument.

00:57:10.900 --> 00:57:13.570
I'm writing down the operator.

00:57:13.570 --> 00:57:16.470
And this operator can
now effect the system

00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.700
to all possible orders.

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:22.060
So even the non-perturbative
strong coupling limit

00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:25.850
will always have products
of atomic raising operators,

00:57:25.850 --> 00:57:28.660
lowering operators with photon
raising and lowering operators.

00:57:32.790 --> 00:57:36.590
The little bit longer answer
is, some of what I'm telling you

00:57:36.590 --> 00:57:39.090
may be gauge dependence.

00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:46.810
If you work in the-- if you
use, not the dipole description,

00:57:46.810 --> 00:57:50.450
but you use the p
dot a Hamiltonian,

00:57:50.450 --> 00:57:53.850
this Hamiltonian
has a e square term.

00:57:53.850 --> 00:58:00.570
The e square term
allows the atoms

00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:04.420
to exchange two photons
at the same time.

00:58:04.420 --> 00:58:08.640
So in other words, in
the a square interaction,

00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:16.140
we may have a
vertex point in time

00:58:16.140 --> 00:58:19.280
where the atom interact
with the photon field

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:23.060
where two photons are exchanged.

00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:26.100
And then the rules
are different.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:28.770
So in that sense-- but
this is quite often

00:58:28.770 --> 00:58:30.950
when we give a quantum
mechanical pictures, which

00:58:30.950 --> 00:58:34.590
has terms, which nicely
shows the time evolution.

00:58:34.590 --> 00:58:36.670
And you think wow, yeah,
this is what happens.

00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:38.640
One photon at a
time, the atom goes

00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.370
ground, excited,
excited, ground state.

00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:41.590
And you have your picture.

00:58:41.590 --> 00:58:44.920
And it is fully consistent
with the exact quantum

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.420
mechanical result.

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:48.822
You may be able to get
the same result out

00:58:48.822 --> 00:58:49.780
of a different picture.

00:58:53.830 --> 00:58:57.202
That point will
actually occur again

00:58:57.202 --> 00:58:58.660
when we talk, for
instance, when we

00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:09.390
talk about density operators.

00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:12.960
A density operator is an
average of our quantum states.

00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.640
But you can get the
same density operator

00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:19.860
by averaging quantum states
in different basis sets.

00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:25.910
So if you get one picture out
of one specific basis set,

00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:27.642
it gives you the
correct intuition,

00:59:27.642 --> 00:59:29.350
it's a correct
description, but it is not

00:59:29.350 --> 00:59:32.168
the only possible description.

00:59:32.168 --> 00:59:33.102
[? Collin ?].

00:59:33.102 --> 00:59:35.390
AUDIENCE: Maybe the
thing, I don't know.

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:36.890
AUDIENCE: I think
what you're trying

00:59:36.890 --> 00:59:40.490
to get at is that picture
works as long as you can limit

00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:42.716
yourself to a two level system.

00:59:42.716 --> 00:59:44.810
Because that's
correct on a whole.

00:59:44.810 --> 00:59:47.010
Or is it like strong coupling?

00:59:47.010 --> 00:59:50.535
But as long as you can
identify the two level system,

00:59:50.535 --> 00:59:55.525
or I think the dipole versus
particle approximations

00:59:55.525 --> 00:59:59.517
[INAUDIBLE] an atom may have
transition probabilities

00:59:59.517 --> 01:00:03.010
to others, like from
an [INAUDIBLE] state.

01:00:03.010 --> 01:00:04.507
But--

01:00:04.507 --> 01:00:06.503
AUDIENCE: Actually,
I was just wondering

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:09.247
if it was possible to have
it like a transition matrix

01:00:09.247 --> 01:00:12.531
element to [INAUDIBLE] coupling
the ground state to the ground

01:00:12.531 --> 01:00:13.030
state.

01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.770
PROFESSOR: Yes.

01:00:13.770 --> 01:00:16.920
The e square operator
does that, because

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:21.206
in the other gauge,
which is pa, pa.

01:00:21.206 --> 01:00:25.450
p is in dipole operator.
p is the momentum operator

01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:26.550
for the atoms.

01:00:26.550 --> 01:00:29.776
And the p operator will
switch the atom from ground

01:00:29.776 --> 01:00:31.010
to excited state.

01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:34.820
a, the vector potential,
involves a and a daggers.

01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.730
So the p dot a term does
pretty much the same

01:00:38.730 --> 01:00:41.100
as the d dot e
term, because it's

01:00:41.100 --> 01:00:43.790
a bilinear product
of an operator which

01:00:43.790 --> 01:00:47.150
has an effect on the atoms and
has an effect on the photons.

01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.990
And it means you always switch
the quantum state in your atom

01:00:50.990 --> 01:00:53.430
and create or
annihilate the photon.

01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:56.380
But the a squared term--
it's just a square,

01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:58.350
it doesn't have a
p in front of it--

01:00:58.350 --> 01:01:06.820
will allow an atom in without
changing the state to create

01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:08.320
two photons, emit two photons.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:10.030
And then there's
probably a cross term

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:12.700
which means to absorb
and emit a photon.

01:01:12.700 --> 01:01:17.547
You will actually, in one of
your next homework assignments,

01:01:17.547 --> 01:01:19.380
you will actually look
at the a square term.

01:01:19.380 --> 01:01:21.650
And I think it's a very
educational problem.

01:01:21.650 --> 01:01:23.375
So you really see
that you have two

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:28.040
very different descriptions,
but the results fully agree.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:30.860
But this is already
an expert discussion.

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:34.660
Why don't we for now just hang
onto the dipole approximation.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.070
We have d dot e,
and we just learn

01:01:37.070 --> 01:01:39.790
what is inside the
dipole approximation,

01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:43.400
and what is an exact quantum
mechanical description using

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:45.670
the dipole approximation.

01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:49.650
But and then we can come
back to the discussion,

01:01:49.650 --> 01:01:52.730
is everything we
describe really real.

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:54.750
And while the answer
is, what is real

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:57.350
in quantum physics
is the final result,

01:01:57.350 --> 01:01:59.570
the intermediate
results, you have

01:01:59.570 --> 01:02:03.380
to say that this is
only one possibility

01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:04.725
to go to the final result.

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:23.765
OK, so we want to-- let me
just put in one more page.

01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:44.820
So what we want to do now is
we want to do a calculation.

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:47.080
It's a perturbative
calculation, but we

01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.200
can take it to all orders.

01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:51.480
So therefore it's
exact and general.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:58.720
We want to do a perturbative
calculation of transition

01:02:58.720 --> 01:02:59.220
amplitudes.

01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:17.020
And what I am following here
the discussion in atom photon

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:23.290
interaction on those pages.

01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:26.140
And the idea is the following.

01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:29.670
We have the Hamiltonian
for the atom.

01:03:29.670 --> 01:03:31.790
And then we have a
Hamiltonian which

01:03:31.790 --> 01:03:35.320
describes the transverse field.

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:48.000
And the interaction of
the transverse field

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.690
with the atoms.

01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:55.920
What we want to use is we
want to use the interaction

01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:02.980
picture, which is often
the nicest picture

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:08.380
to describe the effect of
the interaction between two

01:04:08.380 --> 01:04:10.570
systems.

01:04:10.570 --> 01:04:17.750
In the interaction picture,
you are transforming

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:22.480
from you Schrodinger
type e function

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:27.390
to wave function psi tilde.

01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:32.580
And those wave function
psi tilde include already

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:35.860
the dynamics of the
Hamiltonian H naught.

01:04:43.620 --> 01:04:50.760
So that means that all operators
in the normal Schrodinger

01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:56.270
picture become now operators
in the interaction picture

01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:59.430
by canonical
transformation, which

01:04:59.430 --> 01:05:05.195
involves the dynamics due to
the unperturbed Hamiltonian.

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:14.490
And so that's just
a reminder what

01:05:14.490 --> 01:05:16.610
the interaction picture is.

01:05:16.610 --> 01:05:20.800
And we are now interested what
happens in the interaction

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:26.780
picture to an initial
wave function psi of ti.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:29.860
This wave function already
includes the time evolution

01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:31.610
due to H naught.

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:35.240
So the only change now comes
because we have interactions

01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.220
with the electromagnetic field.

01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.950
So this allows us
now to focus only

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:42.419
on the relevant interactions,
the interactions we

01:05:42.419 --> 01:05:43.210
want to understand.

01:05:51.190 --> 01:05:55.950
And the formalism which is
used in atom photon interaction

01:05:55.950 --> 01:05:58.530
focuses on the time
evolution operator,

01:05:58.530 --> 01:06:01.960
which I'm sure all
of you have seen.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:07.330
So the time evolution
of our system,

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.510
how the wave function
involves from the initial

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:14.990
to the final time, is described
by the time evolution operator.

01:06:17.930 --> 01:06:20.370
I will come back to the
wave function later,

01:06:20.370 --> 01:06:26.020
but in order to derive the time
evolution of the wave function,

01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:31.360
it's at least convenient
to focus first

01:06:31.360 --> 01:06:33.120
on the time evolution operator.

01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.700
So in other words,
I want to show

01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:37.850
you a formal solution for
the time evolution operator.

01:06:37.850 --> 01:06:40.800
And once we know the
time evolution operator,

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.370
we apply it to
the wave function.

01:06:42.370 --> 01:06:44.619
And then we are talking again
about the wave function.

01:06:52.350 --> 01:06:58.140
OK, since the derivation
involves many equations

01:06:58.140 --> 01:07:02.050
and they are all printed in
the full beauty in atom photon

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:08.970
interaction, I decided to
use pre-written slides here.

01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:12.530
Also, most of it is
fairly elementary.

01:07:12.530 --> 01:07:17.360
The equations are complicated,
but the concepts behind them

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.540
are very, very simple.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:20.920
It's actually the
beauty of using

01:07:20.920 --> 01:07:22.490
a kind of a time
evolution operator.

01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:24.690
It's a little bit
mathematically formal,

01:07:24.690 --> 01:07:28.990
but it allows us to
express what is really

01:07:28.990 --> 01:07:32.160
going on in the solution
in very, very simple terms.

01:07:41.730 --> 01:07:44.460
So the goal is to do a
perturbative expansion

01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:47.300
for the time evolution operator.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:51.890
If we have no interaction
potential v, the interaction

01:07:51.890 --> 01:07:54.630
picture, nothing happens
in the interaction picture,

01:07:54.630 --> 01:07:56.380
and therefore, the
time evolution operator

01:07:56.380 --> 01:07:57.910
is a unity matrix.

01:07:57.910 --> 01:08:02.840
But if you have a coupling term
v, there is time evolution.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.130
And the time evolution
can be treated

01:08:05.130 --> 01:08:09.110
in lowest or in higher
orders in the perturbation.

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:12.495
And we want to use now
perturbation expansion, where

01:08:12.495 --> 01:08:14.640
we have correction
terms, which is

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:17.149
the first order, second
order, and nth order

01:08:17.149 --> 01:08:20.689
correction for time
evolution operator.

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:22.790
So what we simply
want to do is we

01:08:22.790 --> 01:08:25.580
want to do an
iterative solution.

01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:28.130
We want to find an iterative
solution for the time evolution

01:08:28.130 --> 01:08:28.630
operator.

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.240
The next two lines
is just a reminder.

01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.510
What is the differential
equation for the time evolution

01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:42.446
operator?

01:08:42.446 --> 01:08:45.029
Well, we are really just talking
about Schrodinger's equation.

01:08:45.029 --> 01:08:47.350
Schrodinger's equation
for the wave function

01:08:47.350 --> 01:08:49.850
turns into differential
equation for the time evolution

01:08:49.850 --> 01:08:50.979
operator.

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:53.630
Schrodinger's equation in
the interaction picture

01:08:53.630 --> 01:08:56.970
says that the time
derivative of the wave

01:08:56.970 --> 01:08:59.310
function in the
interaction picture

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:00.819
has nothing to do H naught.

01:09:00.819 --> 01:09:02.689
H naught has already
been absorbed

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:04.710
in the definition of
the wave function.

01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:06.939
So the time evolution in
the interaction picture

01:09:06.939 --> 01:09:10.890
only comes from the
interaction term.

01:09:10.890 --> 01:09:20.810
And now, if you write the
wave function at time tf

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:24.420
as the time evolved wave
function from the initial time

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:29.600
to the final time, then you
take the derivative here.

01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:33.220
You actually take a derivative
of the time evolution operator.

01:09:33.220 --> 01:09:38.130
And therefore, in one step,
from Schrodinger's equation,

01:09:38.130 --> 01:09:41.609
you find a differential
equation for the time evolution

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:43.710
operator.

01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:47.010
In other words, this is
now the operator equation

01:09:47.010 --> 01:09:48.880
for the time evolution operator.

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:53.640
And it's nothing else than a
100% rewrite of the Schrodinger

01:09:53.640 --> 01:09:54.140
equation.

01:10:02.180 --> 01:10:04.900
Interrupt me if
you have questions.

01:10:04.900 --> 01:10:08.580
This part should be--
we'll go through that

01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.400
for solely pedagogical reasons.

01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:13.920
And that means you should
really understand it.

01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:22.250
So this equation can
now be formally solved

01:10:22.250 --> 01:10:23.740
in the following way.

01:10:23.740 --> 01:10:27.310
Take this expression for
the time evolution operator

01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:31.790
and insert it in this equation,
and you find an identity.

01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:33.720
Of course, you haven't
really solved it,

01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:37.610
because you have the time
evolution operator expressed

01:10:37.610 --> 01:10:39.830
by the time evolution operator.

01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:42.150
This looks like a
circular conclusion,

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:43.960
which is just nonsense.

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.300
But if you inspect
it more closely,

01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:50.570
you observe that the time
evolution operator here

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:54.260
is expressed by the time
evolution operator multiplied

01:10:54.260 --> 01:10:59.370
with v. And if you now think
in an iterative solution

01:10:59.370 --> 01:11:01.590
that we want to express.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:04.110
We want to expand the
time evolution operator

01:11:04.110 --> 01:11:09.320
in the different orders in the
interaction parameter v. Then

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:15.250
you find actually
that if you are only

01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:19.210
interested in the first order
of the interaction operator,

01:11:19.210 --> 01:11:21.220
you can use the
[INAUDIBLE] order here,

01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:23.620
because you get one
more power of v.

01:11:23.620 --> 01:11:25.330
So that's how you
get the first order.

01:11:25.330 --> 01:11:28.610
If you want to know the second
order of the time evolution

01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:30.720
operator, you can
plug-in the first order

01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:32.150
on the right hand side.

01:11:32.150 --> 01:11:36.410
So therefore, you get
an iterative solution.

01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:38.710
The first order solution is one.

01:11:38.710 --> 01:11:41.120
The [INAUDIBLE] order solution
is the unity operator.

01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:45.120
The first order solution is by
just putting the unity operator

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:45.890
here.

01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:49.220
The second order solution
is by taking the first order

01:11:49.220 --> 01:11:51.480
solution, plugging
it in in here.

01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:53.980
And then you get two
integrals over the operator

01:11:53.980 --> 01:12:00.100
v. So in that sense,
we have formally

01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:09.000
solved the time evolution
of the system in all orders.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.524
So this is what
we get out of it.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:20.660
Yes, the equations
are getting longer.

01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.520
But the structure
is fairly obvious.

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:30.970
So you saw that the--
let me just flashback.

01:12:30.970 --> 01:12:34.130
The first order term
had a temporal integral

01:12:34.130 --> 01:12:38.650
over v. The second order term
has two temporal integrals

01:12:38.650 --> 01:12:45.130
over v. And there's a time order
in between tau 1 and tau 2.

01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:52.370
And the nth order term now
involves n temporal integrals

01:12:52.370 --> 01:12:54.987
where the times are
ordered in such a way.

01:13:03.610 --> 01:13:07.940
Now we want to go back to
the Schrodinger equation.

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:12.410
So we want to use this already
fairly complicated expression

01:13:12.410 --> 01:13:18.540
for the time evolution
operator and apply it

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.860
to the initial wave function.

01:13:20.860 --> 01:13:22.880
And we want to calculate
matrix elements

01:13:22.880 --> 01:13:26.090
between the initial wave
function and some other phi

01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:32.670
f, some other wave
function in a given basis.

01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:43.380
So we are also going back.

01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:45.130
I don't want to go
through too many steps.

01:13:45.130 --> 01:13:49.270
Here, we're also going back
to the original Schrodinger

01:13:49.270 --> 01:13:50.010
picture.

01:13:50.010 --> 01:13:53.150
So I've taken all
the tildes off.

01:13:53.150 --> 01:13:56.140
But you know the step
form the Schrodinger

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:58.590
picture to the
interaction picture

01:13:58.590 --> 01:14:01.740
was only taking out the
Hamiltonian H naught.

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:07.880
And the Hamiltonian H naught
for eigenstates phi i and phi f,

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:13.260
is simply a time evolution, e
to the e ei with a certain time.

01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.110
So all what this transformation
to the interaction picture

01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:21.080
gave us, it eliminated, at
least for a short while,

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.210
all of those phase
factors, which are simply

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:25.715
the evolution of
the eigenfunction

01:14:25.715 --> 01:14:26.840
in the Schrodinger picture.

01:14:47.460 --> 01:14:52.100
So let me look at a typical
term which we have right now.

01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:54.850
And you can't expect
something simpler

01:14:54.850 --> 01:14:57.325
than this, because this
is the general solution.

01:14:57.325 --> 01:15:00.200
It's an exact solution
to all orders.

01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:02.890
It's a summation over
terms to all orders.

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:06.410
And eventually the summation of
an infinite number of diagrams

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:09.270
is an exact solution.

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:15.090
So what we've got here is we
have an integral over n times.

01:15:15.090 --> 01:15:17.570
And the n times
are time ordered.

01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:22.650
This is the formal solution for
the time evolution operator.

01:15:22.650 --> 01:15:30.950
And that means that we
integrate overall times,

01:15:30.950 --> 01:15:34.420
but what it is under
the integral sign

01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:39.290
is a product of the
operator v at times

01:15:39.290 --> 01:15:42.510
tau 1, tau 2, tau 3, tau 4.

01:15:45.230 --> 01:15:50.240
Since we got back to the
Schrodinger picture, what

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:55.180
happens is between
times tau 1, and tau 2,

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:59.370
the particle simply evolves
with the phase factor

01:15:59.370 --> 01:16:03.530
given by the
Hamiltonian H naught.

01:16:03.530 --> 01:16:05.540
So the picture is the following.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:11.030
The time evolution operator
in the interaction picture

01:16:11.030 --> 01:16:24.760
is a product over the operator
v tilde at different times.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.100
If you simply plug it back
into the above equation--

01:16:28.100 --> 01:16:30.110
and you have to look at
it for a little while

01:16:30.110 --> 01:16:32.810
to see that everything
works out correctly.

01:16:32.810 --> 01:16:38.785
But what that means is then that
if you go to the Schrodinger

01:16:38.785 --> 01:16:42.210
picture and write down the
operator in the Schrodinger

01:16:42.210 --> 01:16:44.900
in the basis of
unperturbed eigenfunction,

01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:50.900
that you have products of
the operator v at times

01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:54.510
t1, tau 2, tau 3,
they're time ordered.

01:16:57.590 --> 01:17:00.400
And because we have left
the interaction picture,

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:04.400
you also get the propagation
with the phase factors

01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.850
given by the eigenenergies of
the unperturbed Hamiltonian H

01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:09.620
naught.

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.480
So therefore, you get
just an infinite number

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:16.840
of terms which have all
the following structure,

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:20.830
that the particle propagates
in its eigenstate.

01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:24.770
It reaches a vertex where
the interaction switches

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:27.520
the particle from one
state to the next.

01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:30.890
Then in the next state, which
may now be the excited state,

01:17:30.890 --> 01:17:33.850
we have propagation
in the excited state.

01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:37.560
Then the excited state is,
again, exchanging a photon,

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:41.090
has an interaction term,
and is switched to-- well,

01:17:41.090 --> 01:17:43.880
for the two level system, it has
to go back to the ground state.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:47.740
In a more general situation, it
goes to another quantum state.

01:17:47.740 --> 01:18:02.160
So therefore, what we
have exactly derived

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:06.640
is that the propagation,
or the time evolution,

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:12.940
of the wave function
is nothing else then

01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:14.590
many, many of those factors.

01:18:17.490 --> 01:18:21.060
And each of those factors
can be represented

01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.460
by a diagram like this.

01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:42.410
So let me just write down
what this diagram here

01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:45.010
means mathematically.

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:51.970
It means that initially, we
have a photon of energy epsilon,

01:18:51.970 --> 01:18:56.200
of polarization epsilon, wave
factor k, and a certain energy.

01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:59.080
And we have
particles in state a.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:10.970
That means that we get from the
initial time to the time tau 1.

01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:14.650
And tau 1 is the time
of the first vertex

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:20.970
of the first photon exchange,
that the wave function evolves.

01:19:23.850 --> 01:19:28.800
And it evolves with an energy
of the unperturbed Hamiltonian,

01:19:28.800 --> 01:19:31.450
which is the atomic energy.

01:19:31.450 --> 01:19:33.510
And we have one
photon h bar omega.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:39.860
At the time tau 1--
and this is when

01:19:39.860 --> 01:19:41.560
the diagram on
the left hand side

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:47.070
has a vertex-- we are now
bringing in the interaction

01:19:47.070 --> 01:19:50.880
operator, which
acts on the atom.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:55.100
It takes the atom from
state A to state B.

01:19:55.100 --> 01:19:58.640
And it changes the
state of the photon.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.690
In this case, a photon
with a certain wave factor

01:20:01.690 --> 01:20:06.500
and polarization
simply disappears.

01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:14.140
So this is now the time tau 1.

01:20:14.140 --> 01:20:18.610
The next Vertex is
reached at time tau 2.

01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:23.580
And between the time
tau 2 and tau 1,

01:20:23.580 --> 01:20:29.710
the system evolves according
to the Hamiltonian H naught.

01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:34.710
And the energy is now,
because we have no photon,

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:41.440
is simply the energy
of the atom in state B.

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:44.910
Then we reach the next vertex.

01:20:44.910 --> 01:20:48.350
We start with a state
B and no photon.

01:20:48.350 --> 01:20:52.190
The interaction
switches, as now I

01:20:52.190 --> 01:20:54.000
assumed we have more
than two levels.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.620
Two are state C. And we
have now a photon, which

01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:02.600
may be different, k
prime epsilon prime.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:08.410
Since we are now, for this
given example, I've selected n

01:21:08.410 --> 01:21:11.290
equals 2, something
which is second order

01:21:11.290 --> 01:21:12.790
in the perturbation.

01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:19.600
But that means now that
between the time tau

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:25.790
2 and the final tie-in for
the time propagation, that's

01:21:25.790 --> 01:21:27.340
now everything is done.

01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:29.300
Things propagate.

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:33.380
And the unperturbed
Hamiltonian H naught

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:36.010
gives us now a
phase factor, which

01:21:36.010 --> 01:21:40.580
reflects the energy
of the atomic state,

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:44.770
and the energy of
the photon in mode k

01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:49.510
prime epsilon prime with
energy omega h per omega prime.

01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:53.200
So in other words, I hope you
see that at the end of this--

01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:55.510
I mean, this is why people
have Feynman diagrams.

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:58.630
It's a complicated, involved
mathematical formulation

01:21:58.630 --> 01:22:00.270
with multiple integrations.

01:22:00.270 --> 01:22:03.330
But at the end of the
day, what we have derived

01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:06.772
is that the most
general solutions

01:22:06.772 --> 01:22:13.330
to all orders in the probation
is nothing else than a sum

01:22:13.330 --> 01:22:16.610
and integral over
diagrams like this.

01:22:16.610 --> 01:22:21.210
So when I depict it here, the
second order diagram, of course

01:22:21.210 --> 01:22:25.860
this has an exact
mathematical meaning.

01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:28.350
And what we have to
do is when we solve

01:22:28.350 --> 01:22:30.540
a quantum mechanical
equation, we

01:22:30.540 --> 01:22:33.330
have to now allow those
interactions, which

01:22:33.330 --> 01:22:37.910
happen at time tau 1 and tau 2,
to happen at arbitrary times.

01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:40.680
So therefore, we have
to sum over amplitudes

01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:44.162
by integrating over
times tau 1 and tau 2.

01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:49.890
So on Friday-- I
have to stop now.

01:22:49.890 --> 01:22:51.980
I think there's a
seminar right now.

01:22:51.980 --> 01:22:56.540
On Friday, I will show you
that with this description,

01:22:56.540 --> 01:23:00.720
we have actually captured
everything I explained to you

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:04.410
earlier-- those virtual
states, the emission

01:23:04.410 --> 01:23:06.890
of virtual or real photons.

01:23:06.890 --> 01:23:08.840
So everything that
which was maybe

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:12.180
qualitative at the
beginning of this section

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:15.340
has now a precise,
mathematical meaning.

01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:17.720
But that's what we do on Friday.

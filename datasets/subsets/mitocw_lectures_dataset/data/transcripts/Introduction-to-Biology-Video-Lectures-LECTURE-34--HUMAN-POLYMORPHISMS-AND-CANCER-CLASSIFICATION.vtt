00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Today is my last class with you.
Awe, I'm sorry, too. You guys are

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
a lot of fun. This has actually
been the most interactive 7.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
1 I've ever had. Usually there are
a couple of people who perk up and

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
say things, but you guys are great
because all sorts of people are

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
willing to contribute. So,
I've had a wonderful time and

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
it certainly seems like
you guys have learned a lot.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
What I'd like to do for my last
lecture is pick up again a little

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
bit like I did with genomics and
try to give you a sense of where

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
things are going. I always
like doing this because I

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
get to talk about things that
are in none of the textbooks that,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
well, I mean, it's just stuff that
many people working in the field

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
don't necessarily know. And
that's what's so much fun about

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
teaching introductory biology is
because it only takes a semester for

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you guys to get up to the point of
at least being able to understand

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
what's getting done
on the cutting-edge.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Even if you might not yet be
able to go off and practice it,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
you might need a little
more experience for that,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
but you'd be surprised,
it's not that much more.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Take maybe Project Lab and you'll
be able to start doing it already.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It's really wonderful that it's
possible to grasp what's going on.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And, in many ways, you guys may
have an advantage in grasping what's

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
going on because, as
I've already hinted,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
biology's undergoing this remarkable
transformation from being a purely

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
laboratory-based science where each
individual works on his or her own

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
project to being an
information-based science that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
involves an integration of vast
amounts of data across the whole

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
world and trying to learn things
from this tremendous dataset.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
And, in that sense, I think
the new students coming into

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
the field have a distinct advantage
over those who have been in it.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
And certainly the students who
know mathematical and physical and

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
chemical and other sorts of things,
and aren't scared to write computer

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
code when they need to write
computer code have a really

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
great advantage. So,
anyway, all that by way of

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
introduction. I want to talk about
two subjects today of great interest

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to me. One is DNA variation
and one is RNA variation.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The variation of DNA sequence
between individuals within a

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
population, and in particular our
population, and the other is RNA

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
variation, the variation in RNA
expression between different cell

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
types, different tissues.
And the work I'm going to talk

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
about today is work that I,
and my colleagues, have all been

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
involved in. And it's
stuff I know and love.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
So, feel free to ask questions
about it. I may know the answers,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
but what's reasonably fun about
these lectures is if I don't know

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
the answers it's probably the
case that the answers aren't known.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
So, that's good fun because
it's stuff I really do know well,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and I love. So, anyway, here's some
DNA sequence. It's pretty boring.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
This is a chunk of sequence
from, let's say, the human genome.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000
How much does this differ
between any two individuals?

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000
If I were to sequence any two
chromosomes, any two copies of the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
chromosome from an individual in
this class or two individuals on

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
this planet, how much would they
differ? The answer is that much.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
That's the average amount of
difference between any two people on

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
this planet. Not a lot. If you
counted up, it is on average

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
one nucleotide difference out of 1,
00 nucleotides on average, somewhat

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
less than one part in 1, 00
or better than 99.9% identity

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
between any two individuals.
Now, that is a very small amount,

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
not just in absolute terms,
99.9% identity is a lot,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000
but in comparative terms with other
species. If I take two chimpanzees

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
in Africa, on average they will
differ by about twice as much as any

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000
two random humans. And if
I take two orangutans in

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Southeast Asia, they will
on average differ by about

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
eight times as much as any
two humans on this planet.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
You guys think the
orangutans all look the same.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.000
They think you all look the same,
and they're right. So, why is this?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Why are humans
amongst mammalian

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000
species relatively limited
in the amount of variation?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Well, it's a direct result
of our population history.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
It turns out that the amount of
variation that can be sustained in a

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000
population depends on two things.
At equilibrium, if population has

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
constant size N for a very long
time and a certain mutation rate,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Mu, you can just write a
piece of arithmetic that says,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000
well, mutations are always
arising due to new mutations in the

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
population and mutations are
being lost by genetic drift,

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
just by random sampling from
generation to generation.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And those two processes, the
creation of new mutations and

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
the loss of mutations just due to
random sampling in each generation,

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
sets up an equilibrium, and the
equilibrium defines an equation

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000
there, Pi equals one over one
plus four and Mu reciprocal which

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
equation you have no need to
memorize whatsoever and possibly

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
even no need to write down. The
important point is the concept,

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
that if you know the number of
organisms in the population and you

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
know the mutation rate, those
set up the bounds of mutation

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
and drift, and you can
write down how polymorphic,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.000
how heterozygous random individuals
should be at equilibrium.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
That is if the population has been
at size N for a very long time.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Well, the expected amount
of heterozygosity for the

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000
human population -- Sorry.
For a population of size 10,

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000
00 would be about one nucleotide in
1300. We have exactly the amount of

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:11.000
heterozygosity you would expect
for a population of about 10,

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000
00 individuals. Yeah, but wait,
we're not a population of 10,000

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
individuals. Why do we have the
heterozygosity you would expect from

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000
a population of 10, 00
individuals? We're six billion.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000
It's a reflection
of our history.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Because remember I said that
was the statement about what the

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000
population heterozygosity
should be at equilibrium?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000
We haven't been six billion
people except very recently.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
The human population has
undergone an exponential expansion.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000
It used to be a relatively small
size, and then it very recently

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:52.000
underwent this huge exponential
expansion. If you actually write

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
down the equations, the
amount of variation in our

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000
population was determined by that
constant size for a very long time.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000
And then a rapid exponential
expansion that's basically taken

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
place in a mere 3, 00
generations, it's much too rapid

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000
to have any affect on the real
variation in our population.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
What do I mean by that? What's the
mutation rate per nucleotide in the

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
human genome? It's on the order of
two times ten to the minus eighth

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000
per generation. In a
mere 3,000 generations,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000
a tiny mutation rate like two times
ten to the minus eighth is not going

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000
to be able to build
up much more variation.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
So you might as well ignore
the last 100,000 years or so.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000
They're irrelevant to how
much variation we have.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000
The variation we have was set
by our ancestral population size.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Now, don't get me wrong.
Eventually it will equilibrate.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000
A couple million years from now we
will have a much higher variation in

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000
the human population as a function
of our size, but the population

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
variation we have today is set by
the fact that humans derive from a

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
founding population of about
10, 00 individuals or so.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.000
And that means that the variation
that you see in the human population

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000
is mostly ancestral variations,
the variation that we all walked

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.000
around with in Africa.
And, in fact, that makes a

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000
prediction. That would say that if
most of the variation in the human

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000
population is from the ancestral
African founding population then if

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
I go to any two villages around this
world, in Japan or in Sweden or in

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Nigeria, the variance that I
see will largely be identical.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.000
And that prediction
has been well satisfied.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000
Because when you go and look and you
collect variation in Japan or Sweden

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000
or Africa and you compare it,
90% of the variance are common

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000
across the entire world. Most
variation is common ancestral

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000
variation around the world, and
only a minority of the variance

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000
are new local mutations restricted
to individual populations.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000
This is so contrary to what people
think because there's a natural

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
tendency to kind of xenophobia,
to imagine that world populations

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000
are very different in
their genetic background.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
But, in point of fact,
they're extremely similar.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
So, anyway, there's a
limited amount of variation.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000
That's why we have such little
variation in the human population.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Now, that variation, humans have
a low rate of genetic variation.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Most of the variance that are out
there are due to common genetic

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000
variance, not rare variance. If
I take your genome and I find a

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000
site of genetic variation at the
point of heterozygosity in your

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
genome, what's the probability that
somebody else in this class also is

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
heterozygous for that spot? It
turns out that the odds are about

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000
95% that someone else in this
class will also share that variance.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000
So that the variance are not
mostly rare, they're mostly common.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000
And it turns out that some
of this common variation,

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
that is most of this variation is
likely to be important in the risk

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000
of human genetic diseases. So
human geneticists have gotten

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
very excited about
the following paradigm.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
If there's only a limited amount
of genetic variation in the human

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000
population, actually,
if you do the arithmetic,

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000
there are only about ten million
sites of common variation in the

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
human population, where
common might be defined as

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
more than about 1% in the population.
There are only ten million sites.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Folks are saying, well,
why not enumerate them all?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Let's just know them all, and
then let's test each one for its

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
risk of, say, confirming
susceptibility of diabetes or heart

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
disease or whatever? After
all, ten million is not as

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
big a number as it used to be.
We now have the whole sequence of

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000
the human genome. Why not
layer on the sequence of

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
the human genome all common
human genetic polymorphism?

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Now, that's a fairly outrageous
idea but could be a very useful one.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Some of these variance
are important, by the way.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000
We know that there are two
nucleotides that vary in the gene

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
apolipoprotein E on chromosome
number 19. Apolipoprotein E is also

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000
an apolipoprotein like we
talked about before with familiar

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000
hypercholesterolemia. But,
in fact, it turns out that

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000
apolipoprotein E is expressed
in the brain. And it turns out,

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:13.000
amongst other tissues, that
it comes in three variances,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:18.000
the spelling T-T, T-C and C-C
at those two particular spots.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
And if you happen to be
homozygous for the E4 variant,

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:27.000
homozygous for the E4 variant, you
have about a 60% to 70% lifetime

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
risk of Alzheimer's disease.
In this class 13 of you are

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000
homozygous for E4 and have a
high lifetime risk of Alzheimer's.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000
And it would be fairly trivial to
go across the street to anybody's

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:47.000
lab and test that. Now, I
don't particular recommend

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
it, and I haven't tested myself for
this variant because there happens

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.000
to be no particular therapy
available today to delay the onset

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
of Alzheimer's
disease. And, therefore,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000
I don't recommend finding out
about that. But a number of

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
pharmaceutical companies,
knowing that this is a very

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
important gene in the pathogenesis
of Alzheimer's disease,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000
are working on drugs to try to
delay the pathogenesis using this

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000
information. And it may be the
case that five or ten years from now

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:21.000
people will begin to offer drugs
that will delay the onset of

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Alzheimer's disease by delaying the
interaction of apolipoprotein E with

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
a target protein called towe, etc.
So, this is an example of where a

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
common variant in the population
points us to the basis of a common

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000
disease and has important
therapeutic implications.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
There are some other ones,
for example. 5% of you carry a

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
particular variant in your factor 5
gene which is the clotting cascade.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
It's called the leiden variant.
Those 5% of you are going to account

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000
for 50% of the admissions to
emergency rooms for deep venous

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000
clots, for example. The much
higher risk of deep venous

00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
clots. And,
in particular,

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000
there are significant issues if
you have that variant and you are a

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000
woman with taking birth control
pills. Some of you were at higher

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000
risk for diabetes, type
2 adult onset diabetes.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000
There's a particular variant in the
population that increased your risk

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000
for type 2 diabetes by about
30%. 85% of you have the high-risk

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000
factor, so you might
as well figure you do.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
15% of you have a lower risk, et
cetera. And one I'm particularly

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
interested in here, it
turns out that HIV virus gets

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
into cells with a co-receptor
encoded by a gene called CCR5.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Well, it turns out that if we go
across the European population,

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
10% of all chromosomes of
European ancestry have a deletion

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000
within the CCR5 gene. If 10%
of all chromosomes have that

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
deletion then 10% times 10%, 1%
of all individuals are homozygous

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
for that deletion. Those
individuals are essentially

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000
immune to infection from HIV.
They are not susceptible. It's not

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
through immunity, it's
through lack of a receptor.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Yes? You certainly can. It's not
hard. It's a specific known variant.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000
You could test
for it. Absolutely.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Now, of course, that only
helps the 1% of people who

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000
have that variant. But what
it did do was point to the

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
pharmaceutical industry that the
interaction between the virus and

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
that variant is essential. And
now companies are developing

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
drugs to block the interaction
with that particular protein.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000
And that tells you that it's
an important protein. Yes?

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Over the
whole world?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I just specified European
population for that one.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
That one, interestingly, is
not found at as high a frequency

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000
outside of Europe,
and no one knows why,

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000
whether that might have been due
to an ancient selective event or a

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000
genetic drift. By contrast,
the apolipoprotein E

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000
variant, at that frequency of about
3% of people being homozygous and

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.000
being at risk for Alzheimer's,
is about the same frequency

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000
everywhere in the world.
So, there's a little bit of

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
population variation in frequency.
Now, the HIV variant is found

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
elsewhere but at considerably
lower frequencies there.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000
And that's an interesting question
as to what causes that variation.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
So the notion would be, I've given
you a couple of interesting examples,

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000
but, look, there's only ten million
variants. Just write them all down.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Make one big Excel spreadsheet with
ten million variants along the top

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.000
and all the diseases along the rows,
and let's just fill in the matrix

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
and then we'll really, you
know, this is the way people

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000
think in a post-genomic era.
Now, could you do something like

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000
that? You would have to enumerate
all of the single nucleotide

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000
polymorphisms, or
SNPs we call them,

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
single nucleotide polymorphisms.
Now, to give you an idea of the

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000
magnitude of this problem, as
recently as 1998, the number of

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000
SNPs that were known in the
human genome was a couple hundred.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000
But then a project has taken off.
In 1998 an initial SNP map of the

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000
human genome was built here
at MIT that had about 4,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000
00 of these variants. Then
within the next year or so an

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
international consortium was
organized here and elsewhere to

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
begin to collect more of
these genetic variants.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
The goal was going to be to find
300, 00 of them within a period of two

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000
years. In fact, that goal
was blown away and within

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.000
three years two million of the SNPs
in the human population were found.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000
And as of today, if you go on the
Web, you'll find the database with

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000
about 7.8 million of the roughly ten
million SNPs in the human population

00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000
already known. Now, that
isn't all ten million.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
And it takes a while to
collect the last ones, you know,

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:07.000
collecting the last ones are
hard, but we're already the hump of

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000
knowing the majority of common
variation in the human population.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Not just a sequence of the genome,
but a database that already contains

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.000
more than half of all common
variation in the population.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
So, we could start building
that Excel spreadsheet.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Now, it turns out that it's even a
little bit better than that because

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000
if we look at many
chromosomes in the population,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
here are chromosomes in the
population, it turns out that the

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
common variance on each of those
chromosomes tend to be correlated

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000
with each other. If I
know your genotype at one

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
variant, like over at this locus,
I know your genotype at the next

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000
locus with reasonably high
probability. There's a lot of local

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000
correlation. So, instead
of looking like a scattered

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
picture like that,
it's more like this.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000
If I know that you're red,
red, red you're probably red,

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
red, red over here. In other words,
these variations occur in blocks

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
that we called haplotypes.
Here's real data.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Across 111 kilobases of DNA
there's a bunch of variants,

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:08.000
but it turns out that the
variants come in two basic flavors.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
98% of all chromosomes are
either this, this, this,

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
this, this or this,
this, this, this, this.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Then there tends to be sites of
recombination that are actually

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
hotspots of recombination where
most of the recombination of the

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
population is concentrated.
And you get a couple of

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000
possibilities here. So, the
human genome can kind of be

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000
broken up into these haplotypes.
Blocks that might be 20,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
30, 40, sometimes 100 kilobases long
in which within the block you tend

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000
to have a small number of haplotypes,
or flavors as you might think of

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
them, that define most of the
chromosomes in the population.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000
So, in fact, I don't actually
need to know all the variants.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.000
If they're so well
correlated within a block,

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000
if I knew this block structure I
would be able to pick a small number

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000
of SNPs that would serve as a proxy
for that entire block of inheritance

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
in the population. So,
what you might want to do is

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000
determine that entire haplotype
block structure of hwo they're

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
related to each other,
and pick out tag snips.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
And it turns out that in theory,
a mere 300,000 or so of them would

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000
suffice to proxy for most of
the genome. So, you might want to

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000
declare an international project,
and international haplotype map

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.000
project to create a haplotype
map of the human genome.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
And indeed, such a project was
declared about a year and a half ago

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.000
through some instigation of
scientists and a number of places,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000
including here. And this
is $100 million project

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000
involving six different countries.
And, it is already more than

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000
halfway done with the task,
and it's very likely that by the

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
middle of next year, we will
have a pretty good haplotype

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000
map, not just knowing all
the variation, but knowing the

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000
correlation between that variation,
being able to break up the genome

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000
into these blocks. By
the next time I teach 701,

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000
I should be able to show a haplotype
map of the whole human genome

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
already. That will allow you to
start undertaking systematic studies

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
of inheritance for different
diseases across populations.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
And in fact, people are
already doing things like that.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Here's an example of a study
done here at MIT like this,

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
where to study inflammatory bowel
disease, there was evidence that

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000
there might be a particular region
of the genome that contained it,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000
and haplotypes were determined
across this, and blah,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah. And this red haplotype

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.000
here turns out to confer high risk,
about a two and a half or higher

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000
risk of inflammatory
bowel disease.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
And it sits over some genes
involved in immune responses,

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
certain cytokine genes and all
that. And, things like this have been

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000
done for type 2 diabetes,
schizophrenia, cardiovascular

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
disease, just right now at the
moment, a dozen or two examples.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
But I think we're set for an
explosion in this kind of work.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000
In addition, you can use this
information to do things beyond

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
medical genetics. You
can use it for history and

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
anthropology as well. It
turns out rather interestingly,

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000
that since the human population
originated in Africa and spread out

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000
from Africa all the way around the
world arriving at different places

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:17.000
in different times, you can
trace those migrations by

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000
virtue of rare genetic variants
that arose along the way,

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
and let you, like a trail of
break crumbs, see the migrations.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
So, for example, there are certain
rare genetic variants that we can

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:35.000
see in a South American Indian tribe,
and we can actually see that they

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
came along this route because
we can see that residual of that.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000
In fact, we can do things with this
like take a look at Native American

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
individuals and determine that they
cluster into three distinct genetic

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
groups that represent three distinct
migrations over the land bridge.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:00.000
And, you can assign them to
these different migrations.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
You can do this on the basis
of mitochondrial genotype,

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
etc. You can also, for example,
determine when people talk about the

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
out of Africa migration, there's
now increasing evidence that

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000
there really were two, one that
went this way over the land,

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000
and one that went this way following
along the coast into southeast Asia.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000
And, it looks like we're now
beginning to get enough evidence of

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000
these two separate migrations by
virtue of the genetic breadcrumbs

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000
that they have
left along the way.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000
So, it's really a very fascinating
thing of how much you can

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000
reconstruct from looking at genetic
variation, both the common variation

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
that allows us to recognize medical
risk, and the rare genetic variation

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000
that provides much more
individual trails of things.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
None of this is perfect yet.
There's lots to learn. But I think

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
anthropologists are finding that
the existing human population has a

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000
tremendous amount of its own history
embedded in pattern of genetic

00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:00.000
variation across the world.
You can do other things.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000
I won't spend much time on this.
Well, I'll take a moment on this,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.000
right? There's some very
interesting work of a post-doctoral

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:13.000
fellow here at MIT named Pardese
Sebetti who has been trying to ask,

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
can we see in the genetic
variation in the population,

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
signatures, patterns of ancient
selection, or even recent selection

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.000
in the human population?
Now, hang onto your seats,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.000
because this will get
just slightly tricky.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000
But, hang on. It's only a couple
of slides. Here was her idea.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000
You see, when a mutation
arises in the population,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000
it usually dies out,
right? Any new mutation just

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000
typically dies out. But,
sometimes by chance it drifts

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
up to a high frequency.
Random events happen. But it

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000
usually takes a long time to do
that. If some random mutation happens,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000
and it happens to drift up to high
frequency with no selection on it,

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000
then on average it takes
a long time to do so.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
If you want, I could write a
stochastic differential equation

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
that would say that, but just
take your gut feeling that

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000
if something has no selection on it
and it's a rare event that'll drift

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:16.000
up, when it drifts up it's kind of a
slow process. It was a slow process.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Then over the course of time that
it took to drift to high frequency,

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
a lot of genetic recombination
would have had to have occurred many

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
generations. And the correlation
between the genotype at that spot

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
and genotypes at other
loci would break down.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.000
And there would only be
short-range correlation. So,

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:38.000
in other words, the amount of
correlation between knowing the

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000
genotype here and the genotype here,
maybe allele A here and a C here.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000
That is an indication of time.
It's a clock almost. It's like

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000
radioactive decay, right,
that genetic recombination

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
scrambles up the correlations.
And, if something's old, the

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000
correlations go over short distances.
But suppose that something happened.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Some mutation happened
that was very advantageous.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Then, it would have risen to high
frequency quickly because it was

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
under selection. If
it did so quickly,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
then the long-range correlations
would not have had time to break

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
down, and we'd have a smoking gun.
A smoking gun would be that there

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
would be a long-range
correlation around that locus,

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:22.000
much longer than you would
expect across the genome.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Things even out of this distance
would show correlation with that,

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.000
indicating that this
was a recent event.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000
So, we just measure across the
genome, and look for this telltale

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:39.000
sign of common variance that have
very long range correlation that

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:44.000
indicate that they're very recent.
So, a plot of the allele frequency,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.000
common variance, sorry, if something
has a common high frequency and

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:54.000
long-range correlation, you
wouldn't expect that by chance.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
So, something that
was common in its

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000
frequency and had long-range
correlation would be a signature of

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:06.000
positive selection. So
anyway, Pardise had this idea,

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000
and she tried it out with
some interesting mutations,

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
some mutations that confer
resistance to malaria,

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000
one well-known mutation causing
resistance to malaria called G6 PD

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
and another one that she herself
had proposed as a mutation causing

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000
resistance to malaria,
variants in the CD4 ligand gene.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
And to make a long story short,
both the known and her newly

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
predicted variant showed this
telltale property of having a high

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000
frequency and very
long range correlation.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Well that's very interesting because
she was able to show that each of

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:44.000
these mutations probably were
the result of positive selection.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
But what you could do in principle
is test every variant in the human

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:53.000
genome this way: take any variant,
look at its frequency, and compare

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.000
it to the long range correlation
around it, and test every single

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:02.000
variant in the human population to
see which ones might be the result

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:06.000
of long range correlation.
Now, when she proposed this,

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
this was about a year and
a half ago or two years ago,

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:12.000
this was a pretty nutty idea because
you would need all the variants in

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
the human population, and
you would need all this

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
correlation information.
But in fact, as I say, that

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
information's almost upon us, and
I believed that this experiment,

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
this analysis to look for all strong
positive selection in the human

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000
genome will in fact be done in
the course of the next 12 months.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000
So, I'm hoping by next year I can
actually report on a genome-wide

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000
search for all the signatures
of positive selection.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
Now, this doesn't detect
all positive selection.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000
It will detect sufficiently strong
positive selection going back pretty

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
much only over the 10,
00 years. When you do the

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000
arithmetic, that's how much
power you have. Of course,

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
10,000 years has been a pretty
interesting time for the human

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:52.000
population, right? The
time of civilization and

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000
population density,
and infectious diseases,

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000
and all that, and I think we'll
have an interesting window into

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:02.000
the change in diet. All
of that should come out of

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
something like this. So,
there's a lot of really cool

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.000
information in DNA variation
to be had. All right,

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000
that's one half. The other half of
what I would like to talk about is

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000
totally different. It's
not about inherited DNA

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000
variation. It's about somatic
differences between tissues in RNA

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000
variation. So,
let's shift gears.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000
RNA variation: let me start
by giving you an example here.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:36.000
These are cells from two different
patients with acute leukemia.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Can you spot the difference between
these? Yep? More like bunches of

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:49.000
grapes and all that. Yeah,
it turns out that's just a

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:56.000
reflection of the field of
view you have if you move over

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:02.000
to look like that. But
I mean, that's good.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000
It's just that it turns out that
that isn't actually a distinction

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.000
when you look at more fields.
Anything else? Yep? White blood

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.000
cells like different. They
look broken. There's more of

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000
them in this field of view. But
you look at 100 fields of view

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:26.000
and it turns out that's not either.
Well, the reason you're having

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000
trouble spotting any difference
is that highly trained pathologists

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000
can't find any difference either.
I generally agree there's no

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000
difference between these two if
you look at enough fields of view.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000
But you can convince yourself if
you look that you see things there.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.000
But these actually are two very
different kinds of leukemia.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000
And, these patients have to
be treated very differently.

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000
But, pathologists cannot determine
which leukemia it is just by looking

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000
at the microscope, it turns out.
This is the work of this man,

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Sydney Farber, namesake of the
Dana Farber Cancer Institute here in

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Boston, who in the 1950s began
noticing that patients with

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000
leukemias, some of them seemed
different in the way they responded

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000
to a certain treatment, and
he said, look, I think there's

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
some underlying classification
of these leukemias,

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
but I can't get any reliable
way to tell it in the microscope.

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000
And he put many years into working
this out, first by noticing certain

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:27.000
difference in enzymes in the cells,
and then people noticed certain

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000
things in cell surface markers,
and some chromosomal rearrangements.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000
And nowadays, there are a bunch
of test that can be done by a

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000
pathologist when a patient comes
in with acute leukemia to determine

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
whether they have AML or ALL.
But it turns out that you can't do

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
it by looking. You
have to do some kind of

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000
immunohystochemical test of
some sort in order to do that.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
So this is a triumph of diagnosis.
After 40 years of work, we can now

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
correctly classify patients
as AML or ALL. And they get the

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
appropriate treatment. And
if they don't get the right

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000
treatment, they have a
much higher chance of dying.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
And if they do get the right
treatment, they have a much higher

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
chance of living.
So, this is great.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000
There's only one problem with
the story. It took 40 years,

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000
40 years to sort this out.
That's a long time. Couldn't we do

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:26.000
better? Surely these
cells know what they are.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Surely we could just ask them if
they are. Well, here's the idea.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Suppose we could ask each cell,
please tell us every gene that you

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
have turned on, and the
level to which you have that

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000
gene expressed.
In other words,

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000
let us summarize each cell, each
tumor by a description of its

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.000
complete pattern of gene expression
to 22,000 genes on the human genome.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Let's write down the level
of expression, X1 up to X22,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.000
00 for each of the 22,000
genes of the genome. So,

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.000
ever tumor becomes a point in
22, 00 dimensional space, right?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Now clearly, if we had every
tumor described as a point in 22,

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
00 dimensional space, we ought to
be able to sort out which tumors are

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
similar to each other, right?
Well, it turns out you can

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000
do that now. These are gene chips,
one of several technologies by which

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000
on a piece of glass are put little
spots, each of which contains a

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
piece of DNA, a unique DNA sequence.
Actually, many copies of that DNA

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000
sequence are there. Each of
these is a 25 base long DNA

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000
sequence, and I can design this
so whatever DNA sequence you

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000
want is in each spot. The way
that's done is with the same

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:36.000
photolithographic techniques that
are used to make microprocessors.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.000
People have worked out a
chemistry where through a mask,

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
you shine a light, photodeprotect
certain pixels; the pixels that are

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
photodeprotected you can chemically
attach an A, then re-protect the

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000
surface. Use a light.
Chemically photodeprotect certain

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000
spots. Wash on a C.
And in this fashion,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
since you can randomly
address the spots by light,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
and then chemically add bases to
whatever spots are deprotected,

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
you can simultaneously construct
hundreds of thousands of spots each

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
containing its own unique
specified oligonucleotide sequence.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.000
And you can get them
in little plastic chips.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
And then if you want, all
you do is you take a tumor.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
You grind it up. You prepare RNA.
You fluorescently label the RNA

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000
with some appropriate fluorescent
dye. You squirt it into the chip.

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:31.000
You wash it back and forth.
You rock it back and forth,

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:35.000
wash it out, and stick it in a
laser scanner. And it'll see how much

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
fluorescence is stuck to each spot.
And bingo: you get a readout of the

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
level of gene expression. I
guess each spot, you should

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000
design it so that this spot has
an oligonucleotide complementary to

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
gene number one.
And the next one,

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000
an oligonucleotide matching
by Crick-Watson base pairing

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000
complementary to gene number
two and gene number three.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:00.000
So, if I knew all the genes in the
genome, I could make a detector spot

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
for each gene in the genome.
And of course we know essentially

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:07.000
all the genes in the genome.
So you can make those detector

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
spots and you can buy them.
So, you can now get a readout of

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
all the, I mean, this is
like so cool because when I

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
started teaching 701, which
wasn't that long ago because I

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
ain't (sic) that old still, the
way people did an analysis of

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
gene expression is they used
primitive technologies where they

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
would analyze one gene at a time,
certain things called northern blots

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
and things like that,
right? And, you know,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
you'd put in a lot of work and you
get the expression level of a gene,

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
whereas now you can get the
expression of all the genes

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000
simultaneously, and it's
pretty mind boggling that

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000
you can do that. How do
you analyze data like that?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
So, we still use northern
blots. It's true. So,

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
every tumor becomes a vector, and
we get a vector corresponding to

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
each tumor. So, this line
here is the first tumor,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000
the second tumor, the third
tumor, the fourth tumor.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
The columns here correspond
to genes. There are 22,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:06.000
00 columns in this matrix, and
I've shown a certain subset of

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000
the columns because these genes here
have the interesting property that

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000
they tend to be high red in the ALL
tumors, and they tend to be low blue

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.000
in the AML tumors, whereas
these genes here have the

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000
opposite property. They tend
to be low blue in the ALL

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000
tumors and high red in the AML
tumors. These genes do a pretty

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000
good job of telling
apart these tumors.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
So, here's a new tumor.
Patient came in. We analyzed the

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.000
RNA, squirted it on the chip. Can
somebody classify that? Louder?

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:45.000
AML. Next? Next?
Congratulations, you're

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000
pathologists. Very good.
That's right, you can do that.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000
It works. And in fact, in the
study that was done that was

00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.000
published about this, the
computer was able to get it

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000
right 100% of the time.
Not bad. So now you say,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
wait, wait, wait,
but you're cheating.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:12.000
You're giving it a whole bunch of
knowns. Once I have a whole bunch

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
of knowns it's not so hard
to classify a new tumor.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
What Sydney Farber did was he
discovered in the first place that

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
there existed two subtypes.
Surely that's harder than

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
classifying when you're
given a bunch of knowns. And

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000
that's true. So,
suppose instead,

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
I didn't tell you in advance which
were AML's and which were ALL's,

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
and I just gave you vectors
corresponding to a large number of

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000
tumors, do you think you would be
able to sort out that they actually

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:49.000
fell into
two clusters?

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Could you by computer tell that
there's one class and the other

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:57.000
class? Turns out that you can.
Now, I've made it a little easier

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.000
by not listing most of
the 22,000 columns here.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
But think about it. Every
tumor is a point in 22,

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
00 dimensional space. If some
of the tumors are similar,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
what can you say about those
points in 22,000 dimensional space?

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:18.000
They're going to be clumped
together. They're near each other.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
So, just plot every tumor as a
point in 22,000 dimensional space,

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
and your question is, do the points
tend to lie in two clumps up in 22,

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000
00 dimensional space? And
there's simple arithmetic you

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.000
can learn using linear algebra to
get some separating hyperplane and

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
ask, do tumors lie on one
side or the other? And,

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000
it turns out the procedures like
that will quickly tell you that

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
these tumors clump into two very
clear clumps. They're not randomly

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000
distributed. And so,
if you get these tumors,

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
and you do gene expression on them
and put the data into a computer,

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000
the amount of time it takes the
computer to discover that there were

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000
actually two types of acute leukemia
is about three seconds marked down

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000
from 40 years. That's good. So,
you can reproduce the discovery

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000
of AML and ALL in three seconds.
Now you know what the pathologists

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000
say about this. They
say, oh, give me a break.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.000
It's shooting fish in a barrel.
We know there was a distinction.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Big deal that the computer
can find the distinction.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
We knew that there was distinction
there. I know the computer didn't

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:30.000
know it and all that. Tell
us something we don't know.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000
That's a fair question. So
it turns out that you can ask

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:40.000
some more questions. You
can say, suppose I take now

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000
just the ALL's. Are
they a homogeneous class,

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
or did they fall into two classes?
It turns out that extending this

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
work, folks here were able to show
that we can further split that ALL

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
class. There was a hint that you
might be able to do so because

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.000
there's some ALL patients who have
disruptions of a gene called MLL.

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000
And this tends to be a
little more common in infants,

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
and tends to be associated
with a poor prognosis.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
But it was really very unclear
whether this was simply one of a

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000
zillion factoids about some
leukemia patients, whether this was a

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
fundamental distinction. So,
what happened was folks took a

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
lot of ALL patients, got
their expression profiles,

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000
and lo and behold it turned out
that ALL itself broke into two very

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.000
different clusters. This is
an artist's rendition of a

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:38.000
22,000 dimensional space.
We can't afford a 22,000

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
dimensional projector here, so
we're just using two dimensions.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
But, the two forms of ALL were
quite distinct from each other,

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000
and so actually ALL itself should
be split up into two classes,

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:54.000
ALL plus and minus, or ALL
one and two, or MLL and ALL.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.000
And it turns out that these
forms are quite different.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000
They have different outcomes and
should be treated differently.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000
It also turns out that a
particularly good distinction

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:12.000
between these two subtypes of ALL is
found by looking at this particular

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:17.000
gene called the flit-3 kinase.
The flit-3 kinase gene, whatever

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
that is, was of great interest
because people know that they can

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:28.000
make inhibitors against
certain kinases. And so,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:33.000
it turned out that an inhibitor
against flit-3 kinases,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:39.000
against this flit-3
kinase gene product.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
If you treat cells with that
inhibitor, cells of this type die,

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
and cells of this type are
not affected. So in fact,

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:54.000
there's a potential drug use of
flit-3 kinases in the MLL class of

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.000
these leukemias, and folks
are trying some clinical

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
trials now. So, not only
did the analysis of the

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
gene expression point to two
important sub-types of leukemias,

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:14.000
but the analysis of the gene
expression even suggested potential

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:19.000
targets for therapy. So,
I'll give you a bunch more

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
examples. I have a bunch
more examples like that there.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000
They are examples of taking
lymphomas and showing that they can

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:33.000
be split into two different
categories, examples of taking

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:38.000
breast cancers into several
categories, colon cancers.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Basically what's going on right now
is an attempt to reclassify cancers

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:47.000
based not on what they
look like in the microscope,

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:51.000
and based not on what organ
in the body they affect,

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:56.000
but based on, molecularly, what
their description is, because

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
the molecular description, as
Bob talked to you about with CML

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
and with Gleveck, turns
out to be a tremendously

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
powerful way of classifying cancers
because you're able to see what is

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000
the molecular defect and can
make a molecular targeted therapy.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
So, these sorts of tools are
quite cool, and I've got to say,

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
in the last year we've begun using
these expression tools not just to

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:30.000
classify cancers,
but to classify drugs.

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000
We've begun an interesting and
somewhat crazy project to take all

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:38.000
the FDA approved drugs,
put them onto cell types,

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000
and see what they do, that is,
get a signature, a fingerprint,

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
a gene expression description
of the action of a drug.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
And then we hope,
here's the nutty idea,

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
that we can look up in the computer
which drugs do which things and

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
might be useful for which diseases,
because we'd put the diseases and

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
the drugs on an equal footing.
All of them would be described in

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
terms of their gene
expression patterns. So,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
I'll tell you one interesting
example, OK? This is an interesting

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:14.000
enough example. I don't
even have slides for it yet.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:18.000
It turns out that these patients
with ALL that I've been talking

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000
about, some of the patients
with ALL will respond to the drug

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
dexamethasone. Some
won't. If you take patients

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000
who respond to dexamethasone,
and patients who are resistant to

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000
dexamethasone, and you
get their gene expression

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000
patterns, you can ask are there some
genes that explain the difference?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:44.000
And you can get a certain
gene signature, a list of,

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
say, a dozen or so genes that do a
pretty good job of classifying who's

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000
sensitive and who's resistant.
Then you can go to this database I

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000
was telling you about of the
action of many drugs and say,

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
do we see any drugs whose effect
would be to produce a signature

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:06.000
of sensitivity? If
we found a drug X,

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
which when we put it on cells turned
on those genes that correlate with

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:14.000
being sensitive to dexamethasone,
you could hallucinate the following

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
really happy possibility that when
you added that drug together with

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
dexamethasone, you might
be able to treat resistant

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000
patients because that drug could
make them sensitive to dexamethasone,

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000
and that you could find that
drug just by looking it up in

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.000
a computer database. So, we
tried it and we hit a drug.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:40.000
There was a certain drug
that came up on the screen,

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.000
yes? That's very much in the idea
too. We found a drug that produced

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
the signature sensitivity, and
tested it in vitro. In vitro,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:54.000
if you take cells that are
resistant and you add dexamethasone,

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:59.000
nothing happens because they're
resistant. If you add drug X,

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000
nothing happens. But if you add
both drug X plus dexamethasone,

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
the cells drop dead. It's
now going into clinical trials

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.000
in human patients. It turns
out drug X is already a

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
well FDA approved drug, so
it can be tested in human

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000
patients right away, so
it's going to be tested.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
So, the gene expression pattern was
able to tell us to use a drug which

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
actually had nothing to do with
cancer uses in a cancer setting

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
because it might do
something helpful.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Now, what's the point of all this?
We can turn up the lights because I

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000
think I'm going to stop the slides
there. The point of all of this,

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:41.000
which is what I've made
again, and I will make again,

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
because you are the generation
that's going to really live this,

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
is that biology is
becoming information. Now,

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.000
don't get me wrong.
It's not stopping being

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
biochemistry. It's going to be
biochemistry. It's not stopping

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:00.000
being molecular biology. It's
not stopping any of the things

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
it was before. 45:57
But it is also becoming

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:07.000
information, that for the first time
we're entering a world where we can

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000
collect vast amounts of information:
all the genetic variants in a

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000
patient, all of the gene
expression pattern in a cell,

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
or all of the gene expression
pattern induced by a drug,

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
and that whatever question you're
asking will be informed by being

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:26.000
able to access that whole database.
In no way does it decrease the role

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000
of the individual smart scientist
working on his or her problem.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.000
To the contrary, the
goal is to empower the

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
individual smart scientist so that
you have all of that information at

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
your fingertips. There
are databases scattered

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
around the web that have
sequences from different species,

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000
variations from the human population,
all of these drug database,

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:47.000
etc., etc., etc., etc. It's
a time of tremendous ferment,

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
a little bit of chaos. You
talk to people in the field,

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:53.000
they say, we're getting deluged by
data. We're getting crushed by the

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:56.000
amount of data. I don't'
know what to do with all

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
the data. There's
only one solution for a

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:02.000
field in that condition, and
that is young scientists because

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:05.000
the young scientists who come into
the field are the ones who take for

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000
granted, of course we're
going to have all these data.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000
We love having all these data.
This is just great, couldn't be

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:14.000
happier to have all these data.
We're not put off by it in the

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
least. That's what's going on.
That's what's so important about

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
your generation, and that's
why I think it's really

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
important that even though it's 701
and we're supposed to be teaching

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000
you the basics, it's
important that you see this

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
stuff because this is the
change that's going on,

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
and we're counting on this very
much to drive a revolution in health,

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000
a revolution in biomedical research,
and we're counting on you guys very

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.000
much to drive that revolution. It
has been a pleasure to teach you

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:43.000
this term. I hope many
of you will stay in touch,

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:48.000
and some of you will go into biology,
and even those of you who don't will

00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000
know lots about it and enjoy it.
Thank you very much. [APPLAUSE]

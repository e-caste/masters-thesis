00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:28.560
PROFESSOR: So today we're
going to continue our

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.050
discussion of capital markets.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.650
If you remember the introduction
from last time,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:38.350
what we talked about was we
talked about labor as an input

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.790
and where it came from.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.240
And these lectures are about
capitals and input, where it

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.760
comes from.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.820
We talked about the fact that
while capital, ultimately, is

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.880
machines, and buildings, and
things like that, what we

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.140
think about in this course,
we're going to think about

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.280
financial capital and what's
behind all the different kinds

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.160
of capital that businesses
use.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.940
We talked about peoples' savings
decisions as creating

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.810
a pool of capital from which
businesses draw.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.410
And then we talked about present
value and the notion

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:08.140
of considering the fact that
dollars in the future are

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.940
worth less than dollars today.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.130
So with that as background, what
we want to do now is talk

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.750
about how firms and individuals
should make

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.240
choices over time.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.040
We talked a couple of lectures
ago about how firms and

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.720
individuals make choices when
faced with uncertainty.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.790
So that was sort of a choice
across two different

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.740
states of the world.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.700
You could get hit by a car.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.460
You could not get
hit by a car.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.540
Now we'll talk about choices
across two different time

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.020
periods, today versus tomorrow,
and how people make

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.170
those choices.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.040
And the answer is going to be
pretty simple following what

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.250
we did last time, which is
whenever you're faced with two

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.560
choices that pay off at
different times, you just want

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.620
to choose the choice with the
highest present value.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.560
So if you're faced with two
streams of payments, you know

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.750
that you can't just
add them up.

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.880
What you need to do is you need
to add them up in a way

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.500
that gets present value.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.620
So, for example, consider the
example of a professional

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.370
athlete who's considering
two contracts.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:09.335
One contract pays $1 million
today, and one contract pays

00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:15.650
$500,000 today and $2
million in deferred

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.350
payments in 10 years.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.525
So that's the two contract
options facing the player.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:30.580
If you read it in the newspaper,
they would describe

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.630
this is a $2.5 million contract
and this as a $1

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.470
million contract.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.340
However, the newspaper is wrong,
because they haven't

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.560
accounted for the fact
that some of those

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.330
payments are deferred.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.730
So they're worth less.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:43.690
So how do we compare them?

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.580
Well, to compare them, we have
to take the present value of

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.100
these two streams. So the
present value of the first

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.810
stream is just $1 million,
because it's paid today.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:53.815
So putting it in today's
dollars,

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:55.260
it's worth $1 million.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.860
The second stream is worth, the
present value is $500,000

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:10.750
plus $2 million over 1 plus i
to the 10th, because it's

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.770
being paid in 10 years.

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.510
And actually here, I'm
going to not use i.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.330
I'm going to use r for the
real interest rate.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:18.420
Remember last time we talked
about how what really matters

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.550
is the real interest rate, the
interest rate you get minus

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.080
inflation, minus the costs of
price increases for goods you

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.450
have to buy with that interest.
So remember we want

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.450
to use the real interest
rate here.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.150
So I'll use r now.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.600
So, basically, whether this
second contract is a better

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.920
deal or not depends on what
the real interest rate is.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.340
So if r equals 5%, then the
present value of this second

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.230
contract is $1.73 million.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.220
So that is a good deal.

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.500
On the other hand, if r equalled
20%, if there's a 20%

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.760
interest rate as there was back
in the late '70s, early

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.030
'80s, then the present value
is $0.82 million.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.280
So it's not a good deal.

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.940
So the key is if you want to
ever compare two streams of

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.260
payments that pay off in
different times, you have to

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.339
bring them back to a comparable

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:18.940
unit, to today's dollars.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.380
And the way we do that
is by calculating

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.630
their present value.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.900
And this is a problem people
have. A common mistake that's

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.970
made is people don't
consider this in

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.680
evaluating streams of payments.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.550
So a classic example is when
you hear someone wins $100

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:37.540
million in the lottery.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.340
It's actually a lot
less than that.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.500
Because $100 million lottery
win, what it really is is $5

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:45.640
million a year for 20 years.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.480
And you have a choice.

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.760
You could take a lump sum now,
or you take the $5 million a

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.130
year over 20 years.

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.010
So basically, the $5 million
a year over 20 years is, of

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.500
course, worth a lot less
than $100 million.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.340
What's it worth?

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.810
Well, it's worth $5 million plus
$5 million over 1 plus

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.100
the real interest rate plus $5
million over 1 plus the real

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.380
interest rates squared plus
dot dot dot dot plus $5

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:18.400
million over 1 plus the real
interest rate to the 20th.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.920
So, for example, for an interest
rate of 5%, if r

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:28.290
equals 5%, this lottery is
really worth $65 million.

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.320
Now, that's still pretty good.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.910
But it's a lot less
than $100 million.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.430
When you hear a number about a
player's contract or a lottery

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:42.420
winning, you need to always
recognize that the effective

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.210
value is going to be lower than
what you hear on the news

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.010
because of the time payment
that takes place.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.675
Now whether that's a big
deal or not depends on

00:05:50.675 --> 00:05:52.300
the interest rate.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.740
So Victor Martinez just signed
with the Detroit Tigers for

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.410
four years and $50 million.

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.560
Now, he could have signed with
the Chicago White Sox for

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.170
three years and $42 million.

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:08.550
Or the Boston Red Sox
were offering.

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:09.925
So the Chicago White Sox
were offering three

00:06:09.925 --> 00:06:11.180
years and $42 million.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:13.290
Now, you might say that you
can't really compare those

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.610
two, because one is out
three years, and

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.330
one is out four years.

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.240
But the truth is the interest
rate right now is so low that

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.940
you can pretty much
compare them.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.690
Right now, the interest
rate you can get in a

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:24.670
bank is close to 0.

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.180
So, basically, if the interest
rate is 0, the present value

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:29.050
is the nominal value.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:31.060
So right now, you can sort
of compare players'

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.150
contracts like that.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.710
On the other hand, when the
interest rate is higher, you

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.940
can't do that comparison.

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.870
And, in particular, what you'll
hear a lot of times is

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.800
these contracts have very
deferred payments.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.630
So even for a low interest rate,
it's still worth a lot

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.750
less in the end.

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:49.900
So that's the key point to
remember when you hear values.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.660
It's to know that you have
to discount them

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.830
by when they happen.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.060
And that's going to depend on
how high the interest rate is.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:01.900
Now, this leads us directly to
the important implication of

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:05.330
present value which is how firms
and individuals make

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:06.580
investment decisions.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:15.750
So we've talked about firms
choosing a level of capital

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:16.910
and a level of labor.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:17.880
And we talked about in a simple

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:19.960
isoquant-isocost framework.

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.580
But, in reality, firms
don't really deal

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.430
with that simple framework.

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.860
In reality, for any given
investment decision, they

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.920
essentially want to compare the
cost of that investment to

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.810
the benefits of that
investment.

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:33.460
And that depends on
things like the

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.440
isoquants and the isocosts.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.710
But it also depends critically
on the time frame over which

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:39.780
that investment will pay out.

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.760
And what firms consider when
they make an investment

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.410
decision is the net present
value of that decision.

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:47.690
On net, what's the
present value?

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.870
Because often, for the
investment decisions, you have

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.830
to lay out money up front to
recoup that money later on.

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:56.940
So this adds an extra
dimension.

00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.040
Which is not just you're
adding up a

00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.350
stream of future payments.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.360
You're actually contrasting a
debit now versus credits in

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.100
the future.

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:08.140
And the math is the same, but
it's a little bit more

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:09.380
complicated.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:13.460
So the net present value of any
investment is going to be

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.160
the revenues from that
investment in period 0 minus

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:21.610
the cost of that investment in
period 0 plus the revenues

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.440
from that investment in the
period 1 minus the cost of

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:30.970
that investment in period 1 over
1 plus r plus dot dot dot

00:08:30.970 --> 00:08:35.440
dot dot plus the revenues in
year t minus the costs in year

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.700
t over 1 plus r to the t.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:45.430
So the net present value is
going to be a function of at

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.130
every year is the investment
making or losing money and

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:53.100
then adding those future gains
or losses up discounting by

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:55.210
when they occur.

00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.260
And the bottom line
is firm investment

00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.440
decisions are very simple.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:02.510
If this is greater than 0, then
it's a good investment.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.760
If it's less than 0, it's not.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:10.140
And this matters a lot, because
you'll often see

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.315
investments that have
cash losses up

00:09:13.315 --> 00:09:14.490
front and gains later.

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.770
In fact, that's sort of the
definition of investment.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.335
It's that you're investing some
money up front to yield

00:09:19.335 --> 00:09:21.960
returns later on.

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.260
So, for example, if you have an
investment with an upfront

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:29.620
cost of $100 in year 1, it's
going to cost you $100 in year

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:35.120
1 to buy some machine, and
you get no revenues.

00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:39.600
So it's minus $100 in year 1.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:50.440
But in year 2, you're going to
earn $200 from that machine

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.280
minus you're going to have
a $50 maintenance on the

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:57.710
machine, so $150 in year 2.

00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.920
So in year 1, you buy the
machine for $100.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:04.480
In year 2, the machine produces
some widgets which

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.915
you can sell for $200.

00:10:05.915 --> 00:10:08.010
But, along the way, you have
to maintain that machine.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:11.650
And that costs you
$50 in year 2.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:20.980
The net present value is minus
$100 plus $150 over 1 plus r.

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.650
That's the net present value.

00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:27.470
Whether that's positive or not
is going to depend critically

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:31.340
on what the interest rate is.

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.170
So the key thing is we want to
take that stream of payments,

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:37.850
positive or negative, and put
them in today's terms. Are

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.280
there questions about that?

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.620
But this raises the question of
well, what interest rates

00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.040
should a firm use?

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:47.440
So the firm has got to
make this decision.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.925
Should all firms just walk by
BayBank, or Fleet Bank, or

00:10:49.925 --> 00:10:51.300
whatever the hell
it's called now?

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.050
What is the big bank called?

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:54.780
Fleet, I guess.

00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:59.060
Should they walk by now and look
in the window and say the

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.820
interest rate is 1%, or
2%, 3% and use that?

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.420
What should firms do?

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:08.250
Basically, the key issue is that
different firms will have

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:10.680
different interest rates
that they want to use.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:16.230
Or firms will have different,
what we call, discount rates.

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:18.550
You can have a firm-specific
discount rate.

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.680
You can have a firm-specific
discount rate that firms might

00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:26.580
want to use.

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:30.290
And what's going to determine
that is going to be the

00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:32.960
opportunity cost of
money to the firm.

00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:42.570
What is the firm's next
best use of that

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:43.820
money they're investing.

00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.090
So, for example, let's say a
firm has a bunch of cash

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:51.340
sitting around.

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.550
Let's say the firm has $100 in
cash sitting around, and it's

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:01.120
trying to decide whether or not
to make this investment.

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.100
How do we decide on what the
opportunity cost on that

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.700
investment is, what the right
discount rate is to use?

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.455
How should the firm
think about that?

00:12:11.455 --> 00:12:14.260
If it's got the cash sitting
around, how should the firm

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.540
think about whether it
should invest $100?

00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:15.720
Yeah.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:18.671
AUDIENCE: Well, whether or not
it has some other place that

00:12:18.671 --> 00:12:19.448
it can invest it.

00:12:19.448 --> 00:12:21.340
Or it's just going to rot
in a safe somewhere.

00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:24.290
PROFESSOR: Well, at a minimum,
we can put it in the bank.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:27.560
So at a minimum, it can always
earn 1% or 2% of whatever

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.910
banks are paying now.

00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:32.530
But what you're saying
is right.

00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:37.210
It may also have other
investment opportunities.

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:39.270
So, in some sense, the
discount rate for any

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:42.350
investment opportunity is what
you could earn on the next

00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:44.480
best investment opportunity.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.290
So if I've got $100 sitting
around, and I've got a

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:50.570
guaranteed 10% I can make
somewhere, then if I decide

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:52.260
whether or not I should take
this investment, I should use

00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.100
a discount rate of 10%.

00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:57.400
If I can make 20% somewhere,
I should use 20%.

00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.690
So, in some sense, what you
want to do is you want to

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.660
stack up your investment
opportunities from worst to

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:04.030
best in terms of
rate of return.

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:08.780
And then you start at the top
of the list and ask, OK,

00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.170
discounting at the best
alternative opportunity, is

00:13:12.170 --> 00:13:13.830
this one worth it given
the steam of payments?

00:13:13.830 --> 00:13:16.650
And then work your way down the
list. So, basically, the

00:13:16.650 --> 00:13:20.560
key thing is that for any firm,
their opportunity cost,

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.030
their discount rate is the next
best thing they could

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:25.080
have done with the money.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:30.770
Similarly, if a firm doesn't
have the money and is deciding

00:13:30.770 --> 00:13:35.130
whether or not to borrow the
money to do this investment,

00:13:35.130 --> 00:13:38.620
then the discount will be the
cost of borrowing the money.

00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:40.720
Right now the bank only
pays 1% on your money.

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.990
But if you want a loan, you
still have to pay 4% for it.

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:49.520
So it may be that you could end
up in a situation where

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:55.550
your $100 doesn't really do
you that much good saved.

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:59.610
And it would cost so much to
borrow the $100, that it's

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.510
better to use the $100 that's
sitting around.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:03.526
So, basically, let's say you
have $100 sitting around, and

00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:05.700
you're trying to decide how
to finance its investment.

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.650
Well let's say you have an
alternative investment that

00:14:08.650 --> 00:14:10.590
yields 10%.

00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:13.890
What you do is you put the
$100 on the alternative.

00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:16.550
And then you say, well, should
I then borrow to finance this

00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:19.040
investment?

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.000
Well, I have to ask, is the
borrowing rate low enough that

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.350
this net present value
is positive?

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:26.780
So the firm wants to consider
all of its options it can do

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:28.730
with its money that it's
borrowing and consider a

00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:31.470
discount rate for each, which
is the alternative next best

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:32.720
use of the money.

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.090
Now it's not just
firms that make

00:14:36.090 --> 00:14:37.700
these investment decisions.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.120
People have to make these
decisions too.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.650
In fact, I faced one, a number
of years ago, when I was first

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:43.220
teaching this course.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:45.450
So it's good for me to work
it out in the context.

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:46.850
I was decided this just
about the time I was

00:14:46.850 --> 00:14:48.210
delivering this lecture.

00:14:48.210 --> 00:14:50.020
And here was my choice.

00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:52.000
Basically, I had to decide
on whether to invest in

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.860
insulation for my 100-year-old
house.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.110
I've got this old house, windy,
crappy, whatever, and I

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:00.650
had to decide whether to
invest in insulation.

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.790
And the math was that my heating
bills were costing me

00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:06.920
$2,000 a year.

00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.230
I was spending $2,000
a year in heat.

00:15:08.230 --> 00:15:09.000
It's a lot more now.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.440
Back then it was
$2,000 a year.

00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:19.050
My best estimate was that if I
insulated my house, I could

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:21.970
lower my heating costs by
about 25%, or about

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:31.000
minus $500 per year.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.970
But to do that insulation
would cost $4,000.

00:15:38.970 --> 00:15:43.890
So my question was, do I make
a $4,000 investment to lower

00:15:43.890 --> 00:15:47.200
my heating costs
by $500 a year?

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.860
Well, I know how to do that.

00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:54.602
I say, I take my $4,000, that's
a negative in year 1.

00:15:54.602 --> 00:15:56.450
So let's say there's no effect
in year 1 of the heating

00:15:56.450 --> 00:15:57.590
costs, because they're
putting it in.

00:15:57.590 --> 00:15:59.890
So the heating savings
start in year 2.

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.330
So then in year 2 I'm
going to save $500.

00:16:03.330 --> 00:16:04.530
But that I'm going to
have to discount at

00:16:04.530 --> 00:16:06.010
some interest rate.

00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:08.460
In year 3, I'm going to
save another $500.

00:16:08.460 --> 00:16:13.730
I'll discount that at some
interest rate, and so on.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:18.140
Now, the tricky thing about this
calculation is twofold.

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.170
What are the two things I still
have to figure out to do

00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:21.880
this calculation?

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.160
Yeah.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.658
AUDIENCE: The time frame that
you're going to spend in the

00:16:23.658 --> 00:16:25.080
house and the interest rate.

00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.940
PROFESSOR: One is the
interest rate.

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.030
Now, for that one, I have to
think well, if I had money

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:31.790
sitting around, what was the
next best investment

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:33.040
opportunity.

00:16:35.130 --> 00:16:37.390
This was the early 2000s when
the stock market didn't look

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:39.880
like a very good investment
opportunity.

00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.830
The next best was the interest
rates were probably on the

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:43.810
order of about 5% back then.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.770
So let's say I could have put
it in the bank at 5%.

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.500
But the other tricky thing
is how long will I

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:50.920
have the house for?

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:55.150
If I'm going to own the house
forever, or for long enough

00:16:55.150 --> 00:16:58.450
that it's equivalent to forever,
then I know I can

00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:05.930
just rewrite this as minus
$4,000 plus $500 over r.

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:15.660
So if the interest rate was 5%,
then that's minus $4,000

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:22.359
plus $500 over 5% or plus
$10,000 which is well above 0.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:24.440
So at a 5% interest rate, if I
was going to own the house

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.810
forever, this is a
great investment.

00:17:27.810 --> 00:17:28.220
Yeah.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.575
AUDIENCE: Wouldn't you also have
to consider how much it

00:17:30.575 --> 00:17:32.302
would add to the value of
your house when you

00:17:32.302 --> 00:17:32.930
attempt to sell it?

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:34.080
PROFESSOR: Excellent point.

00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.570
Even if I'm not going own the
house forever, it still might

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:38.160
be a good investment.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:42.040
Let's say I was going to sell
the house in two years, then

00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:49.590
it would be minus $4,000
plus $500 over 1.05--

00:17:49.590 --> 00:17:50.995
Well, let's say I was going to
sell it after two years.

00:17:50.995 --> 00:17:52.130
So this is the first year
and the second year.

00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.650
So you might say, well, this
is clearly a bad deal.

00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:58.270
I'm spending $4,000, and
all I'm saving is $500.

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.740
And that's in this future
where it's worth less.

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:03.020
But then the question is, how
much does it raise the value

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:04.410
of my house?

00:18:04.410 --> 00:18:09.230
In a perfect world, given that
my house will live on forever,

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:14.330
it should raise the value
of my house by $10,000.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:17.460
Because what I've done is
I've saved $500 forever.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:21.810
So whoever buys it after me
should be willing to pay

00:18:21.810 --> 00:18:24.400
$10,000 more for it.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.820
But the question is that
information, will that

00:18:26.820 --> 00:18:27.860
percolate down?

00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.260
Will people actually include
that in the value?

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.390
So in some sense, the decision I
had to make was, will I live

00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:36.670
there long enough that even if
the next people don't value

00:18:36.670 --> 00:18:37.890
it, I'll still end
up having the

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:39.280
positive net present value.

00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:41.830
If I lived there for more than
about 10 or 12 years, that

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:43.850
would be true.

00:18:43.850 --> 00:18:45.630
And the second thing is if I'm
going to live there less than

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:49.610
that, will the price go up
enough that the net present

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.250
value will be positive?

00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:51.970
I decided to do it.

00:18:51.970 --> 00:18:53.630
I've been there at least
10 years since.

00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:54.720
So it was a good decision.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:58.230
But this is exactly how
consumers face these kinds of

00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:59.350
decisions every day.

00:18:59.350 --> 00:19:03.620
Just as uncertainty affects
decision making of people

00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.690
every day, so does thinking
about streams of

00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:09.370
payments over time.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:10.690
Yeah.

00:19:10.690 --> 00:19:12.106
AUDIENCE: Did you leave
out the square on

00:19:12.106 --> 00:19:14.310
the $500 over 1+r?

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.060
PROFESSOR: Yeah.

00:19:15.060 --> 00:19:16.016
You're right.

00:19:16.016 --> 00:19:18.890
Good point.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:19.650
OK.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:24.230
so now another very interesting
application of

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:25.580
this that may be more
relevant to you.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.600
You guys aren't thinking
about insulating your

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.210
houses right now.

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:31.440
But your family has recently
thought about a

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.830
very important decision.

00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:36.000
It's not about investing in
physical capital, like

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.130
investing a machine,
but investing

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:40.540
in your human capital.

00:19:40.540 --> 00:19:43.110
An important theory due to
Gary Becker, Nobel Prize

00:19:43.110 --> 00:19:46.850
winning economist at Chicago,
was that just as we can think

00:19:46.850 --> 00:19:50.940
of firms buying machines as
investing in physical capital,

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.530
we think of people investing in
education as like building

00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.620
your human capital.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.260
You're spending money to
improve your long run

00:19:59.260 --> 00:20:01.696
productivity just like buying a
machine improves the firm's

00:20:01.696 --> 00:20:02.205
long run opportunity.

00:20:02.205 --> 00:20:04.210
So it's exactly the
same thing.

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:06.280
It's just instead of investing
in a building or a machine, we

00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.730
invest in you.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:10.800
And, likewise, human capital
investment decisions are

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.600
subject to the same net present
value considerations

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.630
that physical capital production
decisions are

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:18.040
subject to.

00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.210
Let's think about this with
an example from the book.

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:26.790
So imagine that if you don't go
to college, you're going to

00:20:26.790 --> 00:20:28.980
work for age 18 to age 70.

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:30.200
And if you do go to college,
you work from

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.725
age 22 to age 70.

00:20:31.725 --> 00:20:33.985
You get the extra year dinking
around Europe or whatever.

00:20:33.985 --> 00:20:36.750
No, that's right, 18
to 22, four years.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.270
So you either work from 18 to 70
if you don't go to college

00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:44.090
or 22 to 70 if you
do go to college.

00:20:44.090 --> 00:20:47.330
Imagine, moreover, that college
costs $10,000 a year,

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:49.590
obviously not MIT.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:53.410
Some state school, $10,000 a
year is what college is going

00:20:53.410 --> 00:21:02.460
to cost. And the cost of going
to college is twofold.

00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.080
One is you pay the
$10,000 a year.

00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:09.620
Second, you forgo earning
while you're in college.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:11.500
The benefit of going to college
is you learn a lot

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.540
more once you graduate.

00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:19.700
On average, at age 22, the
typical college educated

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:21.510
person-- once again, not MIT--
but the typical college

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:25.750
educated person earned about
$30,000 while someone with a

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:28.690
high school diploma only
earned about $20,000.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.540
So you earn a lot
more thereafter.

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:37.210
So, basically, the trade-off is
you pay tuition up front,

00:21:37.210 --> 00:21:40.220
and you lose earnings up front,
but you earn a lot more

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.620
starting at age 22.

00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.240
Well, how do we think about
whether that's a good

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.520
investment or not.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:47.590
Well, let's look at
Figure 22-1, the

00:21:47.590 --> 00:21:49.620
present value of education.

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.640
What you see is a diagram
of the net present value

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:54.210
calculation.

00:21:54.210 --> 00:22:00.860
So from age 18 to 22 there's
a huge cost, which is your

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.360
forgone earnings plus
the amount that you

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.950
had to pay to go.

00:22:05.950 --> 00:22:09.290
Then starting at age 22, there's
a net benefit, which

00:22:09.290 --> 00:22:10.950
is you earn more.

00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:13.040
Basically, whether the net
present value is positive

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:18.160
depends on comparing the shape
of these and discounting the

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:20.530
fact that the earnings you make
from going to college are

00:22:20.530 --> 00:22:22.110
worth a lot less.

00:22:22.110 --> 00:22:27.940
So what's striking here is that
basically if the discount

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.720
rate is more than 5.1%, it turns
out not to make sense to

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.910
go to college.

00:22:33.910 --> 00:22:36.040
It's pretty amazing, if
you think about it.

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.110
You earn 50% more if you go
to college, 50% more.

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:43.540
And yet if the discount rate is
more than 5.1%, which it's

00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:47.203
been, typically, in many years
in our society, it's going to

00:22:47.203 --> 00:22:50.870
end up not making sense
to go to college.

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:51.570
Why?

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:54.150
Because the upfront costs
are worth so much more.

00:22:54.150 --> 00:22:57.380
The upfront benefits of
excluding college are now.

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:01.820
And the benefits of your
education are distant.

00:23:01.820 --> 00:23:03.310
So, as a result, because
of net present value

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:07.680
considerations, unless the
discount rate is very low,

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.230
it's not going to make sense
to go to college.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.410
It turns out now, of course, the
discount rate is very low.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.650
Now we ask ourselves, OK, what
is the discount rate your

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:25.260
parents face when they
decide whether

00:23:25.260 --> 00:23:26.090
to send you to college?

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:27.010
Or maybe you faced it?

00:23:27.010 --> 00:23:28.590
Maybe you're paying for
your own college.

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:30.260
What's the discount
rate you face?

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.500
Well, once again, it's the
opportunity cost of the money

00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:37.710
you use to go to college and the
opportunity cost of what

00:23:37.710 --> 00:23:39.410
you could have done with the
money you made if you were

00:23:39.410 --> 00:23:40.660
working now at gap.

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:45.180
The opportunity cost of the
money you could have made, is

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.040
you could have saved that
at some interest rate.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:50.760
But the truth is whatever you
could have saved it at,

00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.230
nothing is yielding much
more than 0 right now.

00:23:53.230 --> 00:23:55.170
There's no investment that
yields anything.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:58.650
So the interest rate is very
low on that savings.

00:23:58.650 --> 00:24:01.900
Moreover, you had to borrow
the $10,000 a year and, in

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.040
your case, the $50,000 a year,
to come to college.

00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:11.710
And that's at the borrowing rate
which is still above 5%

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:12.600
even in this economy.

00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:13.060
Yeah.

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.860
AUDIENCE: Can you explain to me
what the discount rate is.

00:24:16.860 --> 00:24:20.143
PROFESSOR: Oh, the discount rate
is the interest rate in

00:24:20.143 --> 00:24:21.910
this net present value
calculation.

00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:24.450
So when you're considering
whether to go to college, it's

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:27.750
the rate at which you discount
those future extra earnings

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:28.970
that you're going to get.

00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:33.690
So the discount rate is your
version of the interest rate.

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:36.805
It's the opportunity cost, the
opportunity cost to you of

00:24:36.805 --> 00:24:38.380
what you could have done
with that money.

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.200
What you could have done with
the savings from working is

00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:41.980
basically nothing.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.840
It would have just sat
under your mattress.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.540
However, the money you had to
borrow to come to college,

00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:49.420
that you paid 7%, 8%.

00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:56.000
That's money that has a pretty
high discount rate.

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.300
That's money that's worth a
lot less in the future.

00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:00.520
So at the end of the day, with
today's interest rates, it

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.850
almost certainly makes sense
to go to college.

00:25:02.850 --> 00:25:05.420
However, when interest rates
are high, it might not.

00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:07.360
And that's an argument for why
the government may want to

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.370
subsidize student loans.

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.980
The government is in the
business of subsidizing

00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:13.150
student loans and making
student loans

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:14.510
artificially cheap.

00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:16.290
That's a pretty big government
expenditure.

00:25:16.290 --> 00:25:19.860
It's on the order of
$30 billion a year.

00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:20.860
Why is the government
doing that?

00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:22.620
Well, this table
tells you why.

00:25:22.620 --> 00:25:24.650
If the government thinks that
there's social benefits for

00:25:24.650 --> 00:25:27.670
having a more highly educated
population, then, essentially,

00:25:27.670 --> 00:25:30.250
by intervening to lower the
discount rate through

00:25:30.250 --> 00:25:32.900
subsidizing college loans, the
government can encourage

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:37.050
people to go to college.

00:25:37.050 --> 00:25:37.990
OK.

00:25:37.990 --> 00:25:39.240
Questions about that?

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.180
So that's how we think about
net present value in

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.800
investment decisions which is
basically to put everything in

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.215
today's dollars and then,
on net, ask if

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:52.740
it's positive or negative.

00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.130
Now, the other thing I want
to talk about, in terms of

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:57.250
government policy, and in terms
of important issues in

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:00.436
this area, is about increasing
savings.

00:26:00.436 --> 00:26:05.530
I want to talk about increasing
savings in the US.

00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.860
Why do we care about increasing
savings in the US?

00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.150
Why do we care about
that as a goal?

00:26:09.150 --> 00:26:11.330
After all, I said savings
is a bad.

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:13.150
Consumption is the good.

00:26:13.150 --> 00:26:15.140
Why do we care about savings?

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.750
Well, the fact is the
US government does.

00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:20.030
The US government spends
hundreds of billions of

00:26:20.030 --> 00:26:23.540
dollars a year encouraging
individuals to save in ways

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:25.450
I'll describe in a moment.

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:26.530
Why do they do that?

00:26:26.530 --> 00:26:32.200
Well, the reason they do that is
because savings becomes the

00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:34.620
engine for growth
in our economy.

00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:40.140
Basically, as savings goes up,
that increases the pool of

00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:42.960
capital available for
firms to draw from.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.960
In other words, that shifts
out the capital

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.210
market supply curve.

00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:55.980
In terms of the diagram that
we made last time of the

00:26:55.980 --> 00:26:57.980
capital market, that shifts out
the capital market supply

00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:01.280
curve or increases that
pool of capital.

00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.270
As the capital market supply
curve shifts out, what happens

00:27:04.270 --> 00:27:05.780
to the interest rate?

00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:07.490
It falls.

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:09.450
That leads the real interest
rate to fall.

00:27:09.450 --> 00:27:10.940
Because there's a bigger pool.

00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:12.530
It's cheaper to get from it.

00:27:12.530 --> 00:27:15.950
As a pool grows, it's cheaper
to draw from it.

00:27:15.950 --> 00:27:17.150
That lowers the interest rate.

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:20.940
What does a lower interest
rate mean for any given

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.060
investment to its net
present value?

00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:24.430
It means it's higher.

00:27:24.430 --> 00:27:28.080
In means that any given
investment has a higher net

00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.240
present value now.

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:32.720
Because a lower interest rate
means you might as well invest

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.420
instead of just putting the
money off to the future.

00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:38.490
And a higher net present value
means more investment.

00:27:43.330 --> 00:27:46.360
So more savings becomes
the engine of

00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:48.400
growth for our economy.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:50.860
Because savings promotes
investment.

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.220
When people save, it lowers
the price of borrowing.

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.870
Firms are more likely to borrow,
and they invest more.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:02.300
And so that's why savings
is so important.

00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:05.070
And this is basically a lot
of what Bob Solow won

00:28:05.070 --> 00:28:06.040
his Nobel Prize for.

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:08.420
A famous professor from MIT
won his Nobel Prize for

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:10.770
pointing out the critical
role in savings is

00:28:10.770 --> 00:28:13.690
an engine of growth.

00:28:13.690 --> 00:28:15.490
It's that basically savings
becomes the

00:28:15.490 --> 00:28:17.150
key engine to growth.

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:21.020
And as a result, society should
care about how much

00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:24.210
individuals save, not just
how much they consume.

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.470
And that's why savings
is so important.

00:28:26.470 --> 00:28:30.300
The problem is we don't save
a whole lot in the US.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.320
In China, for example, the
savings rate, depending on how

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:37.110
it's measured, is on
the order of 30%.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:39.140
So for every dollar people
earn in China,

00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:41.540
they save about $0.30.

00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:45.360
In the US, it's about 3%.

00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:47.630
For every dollar we earn,
we save about $0.03.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.020
It was negative for a while.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:49.880
Yeah.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:53.302
AUDIENCE: Are those rates
including taxes and other

00:28:53.302 --> 00:28:54.718
things that people
have to pay.

00:28:54.718 --> 00:28:57.080
So is it like revenue?

00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:02.110
PROFESSOR: Its a share of your
disposable income you save.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.605
The check you take home, how
much of it do you save, and

00:29:04.605 --> 00:29:05.690
how much of it do you spend?

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:09.380
US citizens spend about $0.97 on
every dollar we take home.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.270
Chinese citizens spend
about $0.70 on every

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.010
dollar they take home.

00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:14.730
You might have noticed that
China's grown a hell of a lot

00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.700
faster than the US over
the last 30 years.

00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:19.360
It's no coincidence.

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:22.640
They're basically building up
a stock of capital that's

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.840
allowing their firms to draw
on it at a cheap rate and

00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:27.910
invest. And that's why something
like 20% of all the

00:29:27.910 --> 00:29:30.920
world's cranes are in
Shanghai right now.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:34.410
Because they have a huge pool
of capital they can drawn to

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:38.020
build all of those new
buildings and invest.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:40.730
So this is a big problem
for our place

00:29:40.730 --> 00:29:42.120
in the world economy.

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.020
The US is falling behind in
the world economy, because

00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:45.510
we're not saving enough.

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:47.190
We're not building up
that pool of capital

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.550
that our firms need.

00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:51.920
As a result, there's a huge
public policy effort to

00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.620
promote savings.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.180
And, in particular, there's an
enormous amount of emphasis on

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:01.395
tax subsidies to retirement
savings.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.530
The basic idea here is that when
you put money in the bank

00:30:18.530 --> 00:30:21.510
to save for your retirement, the
interest you earn on that

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.760
money is taxed.

00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:26.330
The interest you earn on
that money is taxed.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.030
That lowers the rate of
return to savings.

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:33.870
And, assuming substitution
effects dominate, that means

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.530
you save less.

00:30:36.530 --> 00:30:39.530
So in today's system, since we
tax the interest you earn in

00:30:39.530 --> 00:30:43.470
the bank, you save less
people think.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:45.700
We still don't have quite
convincing evidence on that.

00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.400
But people usually presume
substitution effects dominate.

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.610
There's less savings partly
because we're taxing savings.

00:30:52.610 --> 00:30:54.370
And, as a result, there's
less investment.

00:30:54.370 --> 00:30:54.610
Yeah.

00:30:54.610 --> 00:30:56.710
AUDIENCE: When we're talking
about savings here, are we

00:30:56.710 --> 00:30:59.308
just talking about just
private savings?

00:30:59.308 --> 00:31:03.740
Or are we also concerned with
what the government is doing?

00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:06.900
PROFESSOR: Excellent question.

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:08.420
Let me actually come
back to that.

00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:09.690
Let me answer that, but I want
to come back to that.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:10.570
That's important.

00:31:10.570 --> 00:31:15.740
What we care about,
of course, is the

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.650
total net pool of savings.

00:31:16.650 --> 00:31:18.650
And if the government draws from
that, that's less money

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:20.120
that firms can draw from.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.080
So you're absolutely right.

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.560
We about the net level of social
savings which is people

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.260
plus government.

00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:26.600
If people save a lot, but the
government has a huge deficit,

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.870
that cancels out.

00:31:27.870 --> 00:31:28.880
And I want to come
back to that.

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.130
It's very important.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.220
This is a good point
you raise.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.430
We take these taxes.

00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:40.080
We tax your interest. That
discourages savings, but at

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.090
least it raises money
for the government.

00:31:42.090 --> 00:31:43.870
So on net, it's not clear if
it's a bad thing or a good

00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:45.100
thing for savings.

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.510
On the one hand, at least we get
money for the government

00:31:47.510 --> 00:31:49.250
which can reduce the
government's deficit.

00:31:49.250 --> 00:31:51.290
On the other hand, we discourage
your savings which

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:52.590
may reduce your savings.

00:31:52.590 --> 00:31:54.110
So on net, it's not clear.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:58.160
But, generally, the assumption
is that on net, total social

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.080
savings falls.

00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.130
But as that question points out,
that assumption relies on

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:05.600
two things.

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.540
The first one relies on the
substitution effects

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:08.820
dominating income effects.

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.870
And it relies on the
substitution effects being so

00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:13.850
strong that the reduced savings
because we're taxing

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:18.340
it exceeds the extra revenues
we get from taxing it.

00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:21.700
But under those two assumptions,
the government

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:25.860
might want to offer some tax
subsidies or try to offset

00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.500
this taxation of capital
income by offering tax

00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.950
subsidies to individuals.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:35.240
And the way we do that is we say
that you can save for your

00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:36.490
retirement tax-free.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:39.820
Actually, it's not tax-free.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:40.360
Let me say it again.

00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.420
We allow you to save for
your retirement on a

00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:42.670
tax-deferred basis.

00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:52.655
So, for example, we have
employer-provided pensions.

00:32:55.330 --> 00:32:57.260
Pensions are plans that
your employer sets up.

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:08.350
where you take part of your
salary, and that is not taxed.

00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.830
Instead it's saved.

00:33:09.830 --> 00:33:12.210
And when you retire, you
get that savings,

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:14.980
and then it's taxed.

00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:18.690
So, in other words, right now
MIT takes $2,000 from my

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.700
salary every year and
puts it aside.

00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:24.600
When I report my income to the
IRS, it's $2,000 lower.

00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.450
So I'm not paying taxes on that
even though I earned it.

00:33:27.450 --> 00:33:29.930
That money is in an MIT
pension account that's

00:33:29.930 --> 00:33:30.790
building up.

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:32.620
MIT has invested, and
it's building up.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:36.520
And when I retire, I'm going to
get that money and then pay

00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:39.270
taxes on it.

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:42.960
Now, you might ask yourself,
so what?

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.510
What the hell is the
advantage of that?

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:45.970
You pay taxes now or you
pay taxes later.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.070
Who cares?

00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:51.097
Why is that a benefit to me?

00:33:51.097 --> 00:33:53.259
AUDIENCE: Because the present
value of the money in the

00:33:53.259 --> 00:33:54.590
future is less.

00:33:54.590 --> 00:33:58.582
The after tax amount is going to
be less assuming that taxes

00:33:58.582 --> 00:34:01.780
don't rise by a substantial
amount in the future.

00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.000
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:04.740
Assuming tax rates
stay the same.

00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:04.860
Let's leave that.

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.780
The point is just as money in
the future is worth less than

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.270
money today, paying taxes in
the future is better than

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:13.300
paying taxes today.

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.340
So if MIT take the $2,000 aside
for me and saves it, and

00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:21.630
I pay taxes on it in 25 years
when I retire, that's 25 years

00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.710
with a 5% discount rate.

00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:24.719
That's nothing.

00:34:24.719 --> 00:34:28.580
25 years at a 5% discount rate,
those taxes are worth

00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:31.380
like 1/3 of what they are
if I pay them today.

00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:34.360
So basically by deferring
taxes, we are wealthier.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.090
Just like by deferring payments,
we're poorer.

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:46.560
We don't have the table here.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:48.480
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.040
PROFESSOR: What?

00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.290
No.

00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:54.040
That's OK.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.260
Let me just sort of explain
an example.

00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.980
Let me just do an example
here and explain that.

00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:06.100
So imagine you've got an
individual who's a

00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.500
70-year-old, so someone
about to retire.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:15.940
They are a 70-year-old, and
he earns $100 on his job.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.280
And he wants to save it for
1 year and then spend it.

00:35:22.970 --> 00:35:25.550
And he has two choices.

00:35:25.550 --> 00:35:29.615
He can put it in the bank or he
can have his employer hold

00:35:29.615 --> 00:35:33.670
it aside as a pension payment,
and he can get it next year.

00:35:33.670 --> 00:35:38.020
And let's say the interest
rate is 10%.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:52.930
And let's say his
tax rate is 25%.

00:35:52.930 --> 00:35:54.870
So the bank route,
what happens?

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:58.220
First of all, $100 he gets
is going to get taxed.

00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:02.050
So he's going to have $75
to put in the bank.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:03.240
He's going to put that
in the bank.

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.660
And that's going to
yield $7.50 in

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:07.000
interest after one year.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.530
But that will also be taxed.

00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:11.175
That $7.50 of interest
will also be taxed.

00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:22.170
He has to pay $1.88 in taxes
on that $7.50 of interest.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:32.490
So on net, he's going
to end up with $75,

00:36:32.490 --> 00:36:35.280
$82.50 minus $1.88.

00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.765
So he's going to end
up with $80.32.

00:36:41.765 --> 00:36:43.180
Is that right?

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.660
$80.22.

00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:51.040
So he's going to end
up with $80.22.

00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.490
Now, if instead he asks his
employer to hold it aside as a

00:36:53.490 --> 00:37:00.160
pension, then he gets the whole
$100, and that gets

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.660
saved at 10%.

00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:06.720
So he earns $10 of interest. So
at the end of the year when

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:08.090
he gets the pension
payment from the

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:11.900
employer, he gets $110.

00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:21.490
That is then taxed at 25%, and
he ends up with $82.50.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:23.580
He ends up with more money.

00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:26.215
Even though it's just paying
taxes one year later, he ends

00:37:26.215 --> 00:37:27.230
up with more money.

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:30.310
And the reason is because he
got to earn the interest on

00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:31.570
the taxes instead of the
government earning the

00:37:31.570 --> 00:37:32.860
interest on the taxes.

00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:34.660
Here, he pays taxes up front.

00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.990
So he has less to save. So
he ends up with less.

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:40.650
Here, by paying taxes later, he
gets to earn the interest

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:41.620
on that extra money.

00:37:41.620 --> 00:37:43.780
And he ends up with more.

00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:47.620
So by deferring taxes, he's
effectively richer.

00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:50.850
And this is a very
simple example.

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:53.620
If you did the same example,
and instead of making it 1

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:59.925
year, you made it 30 years, then
you'd end up with twice

00:37:59.925 --> 00:38:01.970
as much money if you go the
pension then if you go the

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:05.730
regular savings route, twice
as much money just from

00:38:05.730 --> 00:38:09.985
deferring taxation
for 30 years.

00:38:09.985 --> 00:38:11.800
You get taxed either way.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.570
It's just that you get to earn
the interest instead of the

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.155
government earning the
interest. Yeah.

00:38:17.155 --> 00:38:20.440
AUDIENCE: Can you earn interest
on a pension?

00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:20.720
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:23.410
So let's come to that.

00:38:23.410 --> 00:38:24.995
Let me make sure people
understand the math here and

00:38:24.995 --> 00:38:26.890
why it's a better deal.

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:27.360
OK.

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.440
Do you earn interest
on a pension.

00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:29.780
It's a good question.

00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.590
There is three ways that you
can have tax subsidized

00:38:32.590 --> 00:38:33.680
retirement savings.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.230
And let me go through
them clearly now.

00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:36.930
One route is the pension.

00:38:41.730 --> 00:38:45.360
Under a pension, your employer
takes money out of your

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:48.670
salary, saves it in some account
with your name on it,

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:51.420
but they invest it.

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:53.520
And then you get the money
when you retire.

00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:56.390
An alternative, which firms
are slowly moving to, is

00:38:56.390 --> 00:39:00.550
401(k) accounts, which you've
all heard of by now.

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:03.770
401(k) accounts are just like
pensions, except you control

00:39:03.770 --> 00:39:06.290
the investment of the
money, not the firm.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:08.570
So under a pension account, your
employer takes money out

00:39:08.570 --> 00:39:12.520
of your salary, puts it aside,
and invests it as he likes,

00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.270
and you get the return
when you retire.

00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:17.250
A 401(k) account is the same
thing except you decide how

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:19.990
much to take or the employer
decide how much to take, and

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:23.330
you decide how to invest it.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.998
And then you get the return
at the end of the day.

00:39:24.998 --> 00:39:26.280
But the tax treatment
is the same.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.002
Yeah.

00:39:27.002 --> 00:39:29.362
AUDIENCE: Isn't it also one's
defined benefits and one's

00:39:29.362 --> 00:39:30.130
defined contribution.

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:33.010
PROFESSOR: Well, within this,
within pensions, there's two

00:39:33.010 --> 00:39:35.250
kinds of pensions.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:39.800
There's defined benefits and
defined contributions.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:41.780
We can think of this as old
style and new style.

00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:43.960
Defined benefits is what the
auto companies and the steel

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.180
companies had.

00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:46.490
It's dying away.

00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:49.600
A defined benefit pension is one
where you don't actually

00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.540
get an account from
your employer.

00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:53.120
They just take money
out of your salary.

00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:55.200
And then when you retire, they
pay you some amount which is

00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.780
unrelated to what
you put away.

00:39:56.780 --> 00:39:58.410
It's related to something like
how long you worked at the

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.320
company and what your
wages were.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:02.490
So defined benefit pension is
they literally define the

00:40:02.490 --> 00:40:05.510
pension benefit you get.

00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:07.600
And it's got no direct relation
to how much money

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.190
they took away on your behalf.

00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:12.070
It's related, instead, to what
you earned and how long you

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:13.070
worked there.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:15.480
A defined contribution pension
is what I described.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:17.310
It's literally an account
with your name on it.

00:40:17.310 --> 00:40:18.940
And that's what most
pensions are now.

00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.620
Almost any firm you guys will
work for will have a defined

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.885
contribution pension, which is
one where there's literally an

00:40:24.885 --> 00:40:27.300
account with your name on it.

00:40:27.300 --> 00:40:29.650
And most of you will have
401(k)s where you actually

00:40:29.650 --> 00:40:32.700
control the investment.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:37.140
And then finally, the
last option is IRAs.

00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:39.420
That's not the Ireland
thing, but

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.100
individual retirement accounts.

00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.640
These are accounts which
operate outside

00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.360
the employment setting.

00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:50.490
You can literally set up your
own pension, effectively, by

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.590
taking money, putting
it in the bank, and

00:40:52.590 --> 00:40:53.850
calling it an IRA.

00:40:53.850 --> 00:40:55.140
The thing about IRAs
is IRAs are not

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.220
special investment vehicles.

00:40:56.220 --> 00:40:58.280
They're just a label for
savings that you do.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:41:00.000
Any kind of savings
can be an IRA.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.260
You can have gold in your IRA.

00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.090
You can have cash in your IRA.

00:41:03.090 --> 00:41:04.770
You can have whatever you
want in your IRA.

00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.420
Any kind of investment
is an IRA.

00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.370
What an IRA means is you say to
the government, this money,

00:41:10.370 --> 00:41:15.280
up to $5,000 a year, don't
tax me on now.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:16.720
I'm going to put it in a
specially labelled bank

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.370
account, and you'll tax me
on it when I retire.

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.570
So it's just like a pension, but
you set it up on your own.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:23.820
And the firm is not involved.

00:41:32.210 --> 00:41:34.340
Let me just say something
on the IRA.

00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.100
If you're not wealthy, if your
income is below about $75,000

00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:40.470
a year, it operates just
like I described.

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:42.990
If you are wealthy, if your
income is above about $75,000

00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:46.230
a year, then you can't get
the tax break on the IRA.

00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:48.410
So the IRAs are really more
focused towards lower income

00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:50.490
populations.

00:41:50.490 --> 00:41:54.540
Now, here's an interesting
question that you all face.

00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.550
You're going to get jobs
in a couple of years.

00:41:57.550 --> 00:42:00.100
And your employers are going
to offer you pensions, or a

00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:02.020
401(k), and you can
set up an IRA.

00:42:02.020 --> 00:42:03.450
And you're going to have
to decide, do I want

00:42:03.450 --> 00:42:05.740
to do that or not?

00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.380
Now, what are the
considerations?

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.450
Well one consideration is what
I mentioned last time, which

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:11.860
is that savings earlier in
your career is a lot more

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.550
beneficial than savings
later in your career.

00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:17.060
The second advantage, of course,
is that there's the

00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:19.770
tax break which, of course,
the earlier you do it, the

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:21.060
more valuable it is than
the later you do

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.100
it by the same logic.

00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:25.380
On the other hand, there's a
huge disadvantage to these

00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:26.970
forms of savings.

00:42:26.970 --> 00:42:30.400
You can't get them
until you retire.

00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.170
If you take them out before
you retire, you pay a tax

00:42:32.170 --> 00:42:34.710
penalty on them.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:37.120
So this trade-off when you think
about setting these up

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:40.380
is you only want to put in money
you're sure you're not

00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:42.930
going to need until
you retire.

00:42:42.930 --> 00:42:44.300
So it's a good idea
to set these up.

00:42:44.300 --> 00:42:47.270
It's a good idea to take
advantage of this tax breaks.

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:50.810
But, in doing so, you have
to remember that there's

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:52.460
different kinds of savings, and
there's different needs

00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:53.760
for savings.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.995
You can't put savings for
a house in these.

00:42:55.995 --> 00:42:58.750
You don't put savings in case
you lose your job in these.

00:42:58.750 --> 00:43:00.980
These are for savings which you
can honestly say I won't

00:43:00.980 --> 00:43:02.350
need for 30 years.

00:43:02.350 --> 00:43:04.160
And that's the trade-off.

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:06.420
You should do it early and
as much as you can.

00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.990
But you should also recognize
that you don't want to leave

00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:10.050
yourself with no money in
the bank to do this.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:11.890
Because then, if you lose
your job, there's

00:43:11.890 --> 00:43:14.500
nothing to draw on.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:19.130
And that's how one sort of
thinks about these things.

00:43:19.130 --> 00:43:19.410
Yeah.

00:43:19.410 --> 00:43:23.370
AUDIENCE: So you said there
was a tax penalty if you

00:43:23.370 --> 00:43:24.360
[INTERPOSING VOICES] early.

00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:26.835
Is that greater than the tax
rate that you would normally

00:43:26.835 --> 00:43:27.330
pay on them?

00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:29.820
Because then, even with
that penalty--

00:43:29.820 --> 00:43:31.440
PROFESSOR: It depends on how
long you have the money in.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:33.660
If you have it in for 20 plus
years, even with the tax

00:43:33.660 --> 00:43:34.960
penalty, it's a good
idea to do it.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.790
But if you're going to have
it for five years,

00:43:35.790 --> 00:43:36.828
it's not worth it.

00:43:36.828 --> 00:43:38.920
AUDIENCE: So it's bigger than
a tax [INAUDIBLE PHRASE].

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:39.850
PROFESSOR: Yes.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:42.190
It's 10% of the balance.

00:43:42.190 --> 00:43:44.430
You pay 10% of the balance
for the tax.

00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:47.220
So, basically, whether that's a
good thing or not depends on

00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.970
how long the money's been in
there and what the forgone

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:49.520
interest rate is.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:51.630
But for a short investment, it's
going to be a bad idea.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:53.375
If you have an IRA for 20 years
and then have to take it

00:43:53.375 --> 00:43:54.350
out, it's still a better
deal then having

00:43:54.350 --> 00:43:55.600
not put it in there.

00:43:57.990 --> 00:44:01.620
One last point about a 401(k)
that's very interesting.

00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:04.750
Basically, in the theory I've
taught you in the last two

00:44:04.750 --> 00:44:09.245
lectures, what determines your
savings is the interest rate.

00:44:09.245 --> 00:44:11.470
If the interest goes up and
substitution effects dominate,

00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:12.570
you save more.

00:44:12.570 --> 00:44:14.280
If it goes down,
you save less.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.880
But, in fact, in the real world,
savings is determined

00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:19.620
by lots of other factors that
economists are just starting

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.040
to think about and model.

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.650
One which you've know for a
long time, of course, is

00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:23.860
precaution.

00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:26.250
The bigger risk you face in
your life, the more you'll

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.100
want to save. So, for a given
interest rate, we've found

00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:31.080
that individuals who face
greater risk in

00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:33.670
their lives save more.

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.960
Likewise, we found that
government programs which

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.190
protect you from risk cause
you to save less.

00:44:40.190 --> 00:44:41.720
So this is another tricky
thing with government

00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.060
programs. On the one hand, we
like government programs like

00:44:44.060 --> 00:44:47.870
unemployment insurance or social
health insurance that

00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:50.330
protect us in case we lose
our job or get sick.

00:44:50.330 --> 00:44:52.490
We have to recognize the social
costs of those programs

00:44:52.490 --> 00:44:54.000
is people save less.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.930
And that's less savings equals
less investment.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:59.290
So precaution is one reason
why people save.

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:01.410
But there's other factors which
fall in the realm of

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.500
behavioral economics, which I've
mentioned earlier in this

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.010
course, which drive why people
save. And this is one of the

00:45:06.010 --> 00:45:07.320
most important economic
findings in the

00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.280
last couple of decades.

00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:13.250
Studies of firms that change the
structure of their 401(k)s

00:45:13.250 --> 00:45:15.040
in a particular way
that shouldn't

00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.370
matter but does a lot.

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:20.900
So for most firms, when you go
decide to join the firm,

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:22.220
they'll say, here's a
benefits package.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:22.840
You can sign up.

00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:23.880
You can sign up for
health insurance.

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:26.870
You can sign up for
life insurance.

00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:29.780
You can sign up for a 401(k).

00:45:29.780 --> 00:45:30.940
And that's the way
it usually goes.

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:34.245
And we typically see, as a
typical large firm, is with

00:45:34.245 --> 00:45:38.350
new employees there's about a
25% sign-up rate for 401(k)s.

00:45:38.350 --> 00:45:42.380
And over the next 10 years,
that grows to about 70%.

00:45:42.380 --> 00:45:43.350
So people don't join
right away.

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:46.200
They join slowly.

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:48.850
Some firms experimented with
changing the contract in a

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:52.500
very small way that should not
matter in this course.

00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.720
They've instead said,
welcome to our firm.

00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:57.690
You are now signed up for the
401k unless you tell us you

00:45:57.690 --> 00:45:59.440
don't want that.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:01.050
Now, that's the same thing.

00:46:01.050 --> 00:46:04.510
I can sign up or I can tell them
I don't want to be in.

00:46:04.510 --> 00:46:06.300
Those are identical things.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.660
It's just a question
of the default.

00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:09.210
It's just a question of the
default that I have to say

00:46:09.210 --> 00:46:12.680
affirmatively yes or I have
to say affirmatively no.

00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:15.250
What they found when they
switched, is the initial

00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:21.890
sign-up rate from 401(k)s went
from 25% to 75% simply by this

00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:22.890
relabeling.

00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.060
Simply by shifting the default,
you've got an

00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:27.800
incredible change in
people's behavior.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.440
And what this says is that
economics is about more than

00:46:30.440 --> 00:46:31.340
things like interest rates.

00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:33.520
It's about more than prices.

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.240
In this course, economics
is all about prices.

00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.350
I talked about it in
the first lecture.

00:46:37.350 --> 00:46:40.360
But in the real world, we bring
psychology into it.

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.980
Economics is about more
than just price.

00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.140
It's about important
behavioral factors.

00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:46.880
And this says that important
policies that there may be a

00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.120
much more significant policy
than spending all this money

00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:52.330
on tax subsidies and raising
the government deficit.

00:46:52.330 --> 00:46:55.070
These tax subsidies, by the way,
add up to on the order of

00:46:55.070 --> 00:46:57.940
$200 billion a year that
we spend on these.

00:46:57.940 --> 00:47:00.040
So that's $200 billiion a year
that we're increasing the

00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:03.100
deficit by to have these
tax subsidies.

00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.680
What if, instead, we got rid of
them all and just defaulted

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.330
everyone to 401(k)s.

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:11.660
We'd probably raise savings more
and potentially save the

00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.000
government a lot of money.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.780
So, basically, the point is that
we have a lot of tools at

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:18.370
our disposal besides prices.

00:47:18.370 --> 00:47:20.160
And our government policy makers
have to be thinking

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:21.250
about those.

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:23.480
OK so let me stop there.

00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.270
Thank you all for coming.

00:47:24.270 --> 00:47:25.640
Have a great Thanksgiving.

00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.820
And we'll come back after
Thanksgiving and talk about

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.070
equity and efficiency.

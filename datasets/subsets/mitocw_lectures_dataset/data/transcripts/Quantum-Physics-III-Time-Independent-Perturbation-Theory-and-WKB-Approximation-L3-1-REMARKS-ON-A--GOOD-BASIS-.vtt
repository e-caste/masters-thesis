WEBVTT

00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:03.940
PROFESSOR: We have already
begun with the degenerate

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.430
perturbation theory.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.730
And we obtained
the first result--

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.010
perhaps the most
important result--

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.640
already.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.700
It came rather quick.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.340
And let me review what we had.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.820
So we were talking
about the Hamiltonian

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.750
H0 that had degeneracies.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.640
And we were now interested to
see what the perturbation does

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.380
to those degenerate states.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.330
What does it do to its energies?

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.030
What does it do to
the states themselves?

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:46.310
So we called that degenerate
subspace the space V capital N.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.230
And the rest of the state
space of the theory was V hat.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.830
For those states in
the degenerate space,

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:01.970
we use a label n for being an
n-th state or having energy En.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.850
They all have the same energy,
unperturbed energy, En0.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.100
These are the states.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.430
And with k running
from 1 to n-- these

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.450
are a basis of linearly
independent states

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.410
that span the
degenerate subspace.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.780
So that's our
degenerate subspace.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.940
And then, the rest of the
space is the space V hat.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.630
And it's spanned by states
that we call p0's, we

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:33.540
used to call them.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.120
And the notation
is good that allows

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.260
you to distinguish,
with two labels, states

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.710
in the degenerate subspace
and, with one label, a state

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.380
in the rest of the space.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.470
The rest of the space can
also have degeneracies

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.520
that wouldn't matter.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.600
You see, when you do
non-degenerate perturbations

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.980
theories, because
you are focusing

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.980
on a single,
non-degenerate state,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.100
it's not that you're
focusing on a theory in which

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.720
every state is non-degenerate.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.360
Non-degenerate
perturbation theory

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.440
means focusing on a
non-degenerate state

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.990
of a general spectrum.

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.400
Same thing with degenerate
perturbation theory.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.930
You focus on a particular
non-degenerate space.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.200
Whether there are other
non-degenerate spaces

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.670
doesn't matter.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.090
They will be
treated as the rest.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.420
And that makes your life simple.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.530
So we had our
perturbative equations

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.800
assume that we were going
to find states nk that

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.020
depend on lambda.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.460
And they would have energies
Enk that depend on lambda.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.450
And looking at the
Schrodinger equation,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.300
we found an expansion
in which this state

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.490
is the state n0 plus lambda
n1 plus lambda squared n2.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.430
And this energy is En0
plus the first corrections

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.390
plus the second corrections
and those things.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.710
So these were our equations
that probably by now, they're

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.560
starting to look
pretty familiar.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:23.160
And as usual, we say that
a correction to a state

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.620
doesn't receive corrections.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.110
We can work in a
convention where

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.170
it doesn't receive
corrections proportional

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.300
to the original state.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.870
This could be reabsorbed
into normalization.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.730
So that was the setup.

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:48.100
And we said we would calculate
things using three steps.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.820
And the first step was to act
with those unperturbed states

00:03:54.820 --> 00:04:00.670
on the order lambda equation,
so lambda to the 1 there.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:03.680
The first equation
is always trivial.

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.100
So we acted in this equation.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.710
And these states are
killed by this operator

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:15.730
because they are
states of energy En0.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.350
And therefore, you get the
right-hand side equal to 0

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.720
when you have the n0l.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.460
And we discovered that the
consistency of our expansion

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.710
requires that the chosen basis--

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.500
because, after all,
you chose that basis.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.180
Nobody gave it to you.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.790
If you have a
degenerate subspace,

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.630
you can take any set of
linearly independent vectors

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:47.800
that are orthonormal,
and that's a good basis.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.760
It's not a uniquely
defined basis.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.050
But in the chosen basis
that you're working with,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.830
it must happen that
the perturbation

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.235
is diagonal-- delta lk.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.700
And therefore, the first
order perturbations,

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.280
when you take l equal to k, is
given by this matrix element

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.640
between nk and nk.

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:26.650
So this is a key result,
and our first result

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.800
that in the degenerate
subspace, either you

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.600
choose a basis that diagonalizes
the perturbation to begin with,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:42.610
or you compute the matrix delta
H in that degenerate subspace

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.770
and then work and
diagonalize it.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.630
So either way, you do it.

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:53.590
So I want to make a couple
of remarks on this thing.

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:02.440
First remark is a terminology.

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:09.610
We can say that the degeneracy
was lifted by the perturbation.

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:11.770
And that's a great
thing if it happens.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.280
We'll comment more.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:27.350
It's a very nice thing if it
happens, the degeneracy lifted.

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.450
And you have the
intuition what happens.

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:34.200
You have these states are
all here of the same energy.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.720
And then, if the
degeneracy is lifted--

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.370
these are four states-- then,
suddenly, one, two, three,

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.710
four, as lambda
changes, they split.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:49.650
So their energies start
to become different.

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:51.680
And that depends
on the first energy

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:57.170
corrections being different for
every single one of the states.

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:07.910
So this means that Enk1
is different from Enl1

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:09.410
for the l-th state.

00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:12.440
And for the k-th state, the
first energy corrections

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:17.930
are different for all
k different for l.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.970
So for any two states that you
pick, from the list of your N--

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:29.940
capital N states there--

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.760
for any two states
that you pick,

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:34.440
their energies
must be different.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.610
And then, the
degeneracy is lifted.

00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.360
And that means that
you've found what

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.530
we will call a good
basis, a basis of states

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:52.160
that diagonalizes delta H.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:56.990
And already, the
states have split.

00:07:56.990 --> 00:08:01.970
You can now follow each of
them and see what happens.

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:06.320
You know what is
a preferred basis.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.850
So this is nice.

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.510
And so this is our first remark.

00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:17.786
Degeneracy is lifted
when this happens.

00:08:17.786 --> 00:08:19.160
And this is the
case, we're going

00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:23.690
to assume, for the
rest of the discussion,

00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:25.730
for the first part
of the lecture,

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:27.740
that the degeneracy is lifted.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:30.950
And then, we'll try to find
the correction to the state.

00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:36.880
Let me comment that our first
order shifts that we have

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.400
found-- these eigenvalues--

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:49.240
are valid even if the
degeneracy is not lifted.

00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:02.650
The second remark
has to do with a rule

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:06.040
to help you do this stuff.

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:09.760
This will be very useful
in about a week, when

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:13.670
we apply some of these
things to the hydrogen atom.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.440
So first matter of notation--
some people use this,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.230
I kind of like it--

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:37.770
a basis in VN that diagonalizes
delta H is called a good basis.

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:49.590
So good, bad-- it's kind of
easy to relate to those things.

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:50.450
So it's good.

00:09:50.450 --> 00:09:52.450
It gives you the answer.

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:55.090
So we'll call it a good basis.

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:02.140
So here comes a question
that you want to answer.

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:07.000
Typically, you have some
basis that you like.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.830
And you have a delta H.

00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:14.100
Now, you can say, OK, do
I know that delta H is

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.620
diagonal in this basis?

00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:18.240
Maybe I don't.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:19.840
So what can I do?

00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:22.740
I can diagonalize it and check.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.650
But sometimes, there
is a better way,

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:31.510
and it helps you explain why
the matrix delta H is diagonal.

00:10:31.510 --> 00:10:33.280
So this is a shortcut.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:36.120
It's a conceptual
idea that you can

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:41.700
check that delta H is diagonal
without diagonalizing it.

00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:43.380
So here it is.

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.060
So here's the rule--

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:49.560
"rule."

00:10:52.810 --> 00:11:12.240
If the basis vectors are
eigenstates of a Hermitian

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:19.870
K with different eigenvalues--

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.150
so so far, what am I saying?

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:30.270
I'm bringing up a new operator.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:34.780
Somebody gives you
another operator K--

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:36.210
Hermitian.

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:38.430
And then, you check
that, after all,

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:43.980
for this Hermitian operator,
the basis, or the basis vectors,

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:50.240
are eigenstates of that operator
and with different eigenvalues.

00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.460
All of them have
different eigenvalues.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:56.070
[MUMBLING]

00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:10.470
And K commutes with delta
H, then the basis is good.

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.770
Basis is good.

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:23.530
Now, first time I heard this--

00:12:23.530 --> 00:12:25.990
I still remember--
it seemed to me

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:27.820
like a very complicated rule.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.681
Just diagonalize
and forget about it.

00:12:30.681 --> 00:12:31.180
No.

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:34.520
But it actually is very helpful.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.040
So let's explain this rule.

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:46.380
So K with delta H is equal to 0.

00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:50.190
So let's assume we
have two eigenstates.

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:53.540
So "proof" here.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:59.180
Two eigenstates-- n0p and n0q.

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:16.410
And the K eigenvalues are
lambda p and lambda q that

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:19.140
are different from each other.

00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.890
So we said that the
basis states are supposed

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:28.590
to be eigenstates of
this Hermitian operator K

00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:31.090
and all of them with
different eigenvalues.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:35.490
So here, I wrote two states
that are part of our basis.

00:13:35.490 --> 00:13:39.330
And I say that K eigenvalues
are lambda p and lambda q,

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:42.600
and they are different
from each other.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.350
So far, so good.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:52.820
So then we can form
the following--

00:13:52.820 --> 00:14:01.120
n0p, the commutator of K
with delta H with K or K

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:07.640
with delta H n0q.

00:14:11.890 --> 00:14:16.170
Consider that matrix element.

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:22.800
Since we say that K commutes
with delta H, this must be 0.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.950
That operator that we've put
in between the states is 0.

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:33.220
So this is 0 because this is 0.

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:36.060
But on the other hand,
let's expand this.

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:38.050
This is a commutator.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:43.290
So you have K times delta
H minus delta H times K.

00:14:43.290 --> 00:14:46.410
Since it's a Hermitian
operator, the first term

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:49.620
K is near this state.

00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:53.070
And being Hermitian,
you get the eigenvalue

00:14:53.070 --> 00:15:06.230
of 8, which is lambda
p n0p delta H n0q.

00:15:09.370 --> 00:15:12.100
That's from the first term.

00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:16.000
And the second term is a
minus the delta H on the left.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:27.570
So you get the
minus n0qp delta H.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.980
And the K acting on the right
this time gives you lambda q.

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:48.700
So this is equal to lambda
p minus lambda q times n--

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.360
it's the same factor
for both terms--

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:55.060
delta H n0q.

00:15:59.851 --> 00:16:00.350
OK.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:03.710
So that matrix element
has been evaluated.

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:07.640
And it's now equal to the
product of the difference

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.530
of eigenvalues times the
matrix element of delta H.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:16.430
But here, we know that
this product must be 0.

00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:22.550
But since the two
eigenvalues are different,

00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:24.680
this factor is not 0.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:29.060
So the only possibility is
that the second factor is 0.

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:31.820
And you have shown,
therefore, at this moment,

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:42.140
since this is 0, this
implies that the n0p delta H

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:50.120
n0q is equal to 0 whenever
p is different from q.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.900
And that's exactly
the statement that all

00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:58.760
the off-diagonal elements
of delta H are 0.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:02.630
So indeed, it has
been diagonalized.

00:17:06.569 --> 00:17:11.180
Or you can, without
diagonalizing the delta H,

00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:13.130
you can say, oh,
look at this basis.

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:14.510
This basis is good.

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:18.619
Because there is this operator--
many times it will be angular

00:17:18.619 --> 00:17:21.680
momentum, lz, it
may be other thing--

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.589
for which all the states
have different eigenvalues.

00:17:24.589 --> 00:17:26.839
And it commutes
with a perturbation.

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:29.600
So you look for an
operator that commutes

00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:35.930
with a perturbation for
which your basis vectors

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:38.650
may be eigenstates.

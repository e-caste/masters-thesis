WEBVTT

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.550
I'm the head
instructor for 15.662,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.800
How to Secure the American
Dream for the Next Generation

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.040
Workforce.

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.840
I'd like to take a
little time to tell

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.650
you a little bit
about myself and why

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.760
I'm offering this course.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:27.170
I've been studying,
and teaching,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.930
and working on issues
about the nature

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.140
of work for the last 40 years.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.460
I've never been more concerned
about the future of work

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.220
than I am right now.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.440
I'm concerned about the need
for more jobs, better jobs,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.240
for you and for all people
in the next generation.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.600
And so I think we can work
together in this course

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.280
to explore how you can
address these issues

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.170
and secure your future as well.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.960
So let me tell you a little
bit about my background

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.310
so you can understand
where I'm coming from.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.209
I grew up on a small
family farm in Wisconsin.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:08.180
We learned at a very
early age the importance

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.410
of working together,
the value of hard work,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.140
and the satisfaction that comes
from doing a job very well.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.910
My father only had an
eighth grade education,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:22.420
but he told all of us, my
brother and my sisters,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.270
get as much education
as you can so that you

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.190
can get an occupation and a
career that is better than what

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.150
farming will be in the future.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.460
That was clearly the best
advice I could have ever gotten,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.470
and it worked.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.280
Here I am, many years
later, an MIT professor,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.340
thanks to a good education
from the schools in Wisconsin

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.720
and from the University
of Wisconsin.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.440
So in my professional
life I've been

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.050
fortunate to work with a
wide variety of business,

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.560
and labor, and government
organizations over the years,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.450
and I've been a
constant advocate

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.690
for improving relations
at the workplace,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.600
for getting people
to work together,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.230
to think about how the
workforce is changing,

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:06.760
and how they need
to change to meet

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.500
the conditions of the
economy, and the society,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.500
and the workforce that
we find ourselves in.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.760
And so that's what I want
to do in this course:

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.220
to engage you, the next
generation workers, and those

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.200
of us in the baby boom
generation who still care

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.110
about these issues
and want to make

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.810
a contribution to
a discussion of how

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.350
we can improve the workplace.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.900
And I want to especially
learn and listen from you.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.710
I'm engaged in writing
a book on this topic,

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.260
and I want to get your
ideas so you help shape

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.040
how we're going to change,
how we're going to adapt,

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.640
and how we're going to create
the workplace of the future.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.160
I'm Barbara Dyer, president and
CEO of the Hitachi Foundation

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.720
and senior lecturer at MIT
Sloan School of Management.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.130
The Hitachi Foundation
focuses on the role

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:59.190
of business in society,
with a particular emphasis

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.120
on how businesses create
social and economic value

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.120
in the pursuit of profits.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:11.080
We'll be talking about start up
companies and their motivation

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.170
to create a real
benefit for society,

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.750
and we'll be talking some
about traditional businesses,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.840
more long term businesses, and
the ways in which they create

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.520
social value and
environmental value,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.950
and the lessons that can be
learned across the spectrum,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.070
from early stage businesses
to later stage businesses.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.340
I'm Zeynep Ton.

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.550
I'm an adjunct
associate professor

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.710
at MIT Sloan in the
Operations Management group.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.170
I will tell you about how
we can create companies

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.160
that deliver great value
to their investors,

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.990
good jobs for their
employees, and great value

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.540
to their customers
all at the same time.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.300
I'm Christine Riordan, a Ph.D.
Student at MIT's Institute

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:56.480
for Work and
Employment Research.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.350
I am going to be talking to
you about how labor unions are

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:04.070
reinventing themselves, and how
new forms of worker advocacy

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.360
can help support your
aspirations for work.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.189
I'm Francesca Cicileo,
an undergraduate at MIT.

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:12.730
I'm going to tell
you more about what

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.510
our generation, the
so-called millennials,

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.130
say are their goals and
aspirations for work,

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.930
and their version of
the American dream.

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.230
Hello, my name's John McCarthy.

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.250
I'm a postdoctoral fellow here
at MIT's Institute for Work

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.690
and Employment Research.

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.690
I'm going to be talking
to you about freelancing

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.610
work, including new
technology-mediated work

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.330
arrangements that are springing
up across the economy.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.830
We're going to look at some
of the positive and negative

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.720
aspects of these
work arrangements,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.130
and also talk about how work
institutions might emerge

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.130
to ameliorate some of the
negative aspects of these work

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.280
arrangements.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.120
So I hope we will learn
together, and then

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.890
let's take our lessons and
our message to the broader

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.970
audiences, to future
leaders, in this country

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.020
and around the world.

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:26.945
DENNIS FREEMAN: So
hello and welcome.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.766
As I mentioned last
time, we're essentially

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:33.640
done with the course.

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.370
We've done all the
theoretical underpinnings.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.080
What remains is to talk about
two important applications

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.420
of Fourier, in fact
some applications that

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.620
are very difficult to do if we
didn't have Fourier analysis

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.920
and in fact quite
simple to think about

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.830
once we have Fourier analysis.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.934
So today I'm going to
talk about sampling.

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:56.350
We'll spend this lecture and
the next lecture on sampling.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.060
And then the following two
lectures will be on modulation

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.300
and we're done.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.170
So we're almost done.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.030
So we've talk about
sampling lots in the past.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.370
In fact, it was on the
very first homework.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.470
That's in fact I think
one of the strong points

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.100
of this course is that we
regard continuous time signals

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.960
and discrete time
signals on equal footing.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.100
And part of the goal is to be
very comfortable to convert

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.720
back and forth, because
both representations are

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.890
so important.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.604
We see CT coming up
in fundamental ways,

00:01:32.604 --> 00:01:34.770
because a lot of the things
that we're interested in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.160
are systems based on physics,
and that's just the way it is.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.060
Physics works in continuous
time by and large.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.950
However, because of
digital electronics,

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.130
we like to process things
with digital electronics,

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.650
because it's so inexpensive.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.290
So for that reason, we
want to go back and forth.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.630
And what we'll see
today is that when

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.090
we think about system
levels, when we think about

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.000
signal level conversion,
Fourier transform is the key.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.040
So keep in mind
we've already thought

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.430
about how you would convert
a CT system into a DT

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.340
representation.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.400
We did that back in
about Homework 3 or so.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.830
So what's special today
is thinking about--

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.450
rather than thinking
about systems,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.040
thinking about signals.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.710
And as you can imagine,
there's enormous reasons

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:21.570
why you would want to
think about signals

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.670
from a digital point of view.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.610
Virtually all the things that
you play with all the time

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:27.930
are digital.

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.780
So you think about
audio signals,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.550
they're now stored digitally.

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.340
Thing about pictures, digital.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.872
Video, digital.

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:40.330
Everything on the web, because
there's no other way the web

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.250
can work.

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.650
If it's on the
web, it's digital.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.210
So there's just
an enormous reason

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.630
why we would like to understand
how to take a continuous time

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.370
signal and turn it into a
discrete representation.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.940
This is just motivation.

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.700
We tend to think
about common signals

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.620
that we deal with
everyday as though they

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.000
were in continuous time,
continuous space, same thing.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.650
We think about
things like pictures

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.810
as though they were continuous.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:08.680
They aren't.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.930
Anybody who has a
digital camera knows

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:16.000
that if you zoom in enough,
you see individual pixels.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.980
They are not continuous
representations.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.090
They're discrete
representations.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.610
Even some kinds of
pictures that are ancient--

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.360
well, ancient by your
standards at least.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.780
Even well-known kinds of
pictures like newsprint,

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.890
in an underlying sense, they
are discrete representations.

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.960
So what's showed
here is a picture

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.800
of a rose and a halftone
image of the type

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.410
that would be printed
in a newspaper.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.760
And if you zoom in,
you can see this--

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.650
so if you zoom into
this square so you

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.840
can see this better, this,
which is not really continuous,

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.540
I'm showing it on a
digital projector,

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.700
it's actually got pixels too.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.890
But the pixels are small
enough for the time being

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:07.220
I'm going to ignore that.

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:10.655
So consider this continuous
even though it isn't.

00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:13.030
And you can see the discrete
nature of this one much more

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.530
clearly.

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.190
In fact, the halftone
pictures that you

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.160
see in a newspaper are not
only discrete in space,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.750
but they're discrete
in amplitude,

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.970
because they're
printed with ink.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.850
Ink comes in two
flavors, ink or no ink.

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.090
So they are a binary
representation in intensity

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.060
as well.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.910
And we'll talk about that a
little bit more the next time.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.180
So in order to have a complete
digital representation,

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.220
you need to think about not only
sampling in the time or here

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.290
the space dimension,
but also sampling

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:54.480
in the voltage or the
amplitude dimension.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.540
Even the highest resolution
picture you have ever seen

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.990
is digital.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.560
So this refers to the
completely ancient technology of

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.640
how do you make a digital print?

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.270
So a very high-quality
picture is

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:11.910
made from an emulsion of some
sort of a chemical, originally

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.680
silver bromide.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.930
The idea was that you
had very small crystals

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.440
of silver bromide that
could be reduced by a photon

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.680
to turn them into silver metal.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.710
And the idea was that
exposure to light

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.770
would therefore convert
silver bromide to silver.

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.670
And then developing meant
washing away the silver bromide

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:35.400
salt that remained
that was not converted,

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.350
leaving behind the
silver that had.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.570
And that was the basis
for the chemical reaction

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.400
that gave rise to pictures.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.700
The point being that even
there, these crystals

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.670
are on the order of
a micron in size,

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:50.680
and they're either on or off.

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.010
So even there it was
a sampled version.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:59.430
And if it weren't enough,
everything you've ever seen

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.510
is sampled, because that's
the way your eye works.

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:06.270
Your eye has individual cells
that either respond to light

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.070
or don't.

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.940
There's about 100 million
rods, about 6 million cones.

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.510
So every image you have
ever seen is sampled.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.520
So one question is--

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.470
and it's such a good sampling
that you don't even notice.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.610
But maybe that's because you're,
well, unaware, to be polite.

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.420
So think about, how
well sampled is it?

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.680
So I know that this picture is
sampled, because I can come up

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.690
and I can see the
individual pixels.

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:47.150
I can see a little
grid of pixels.

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:52.630
There's 1,024 by 768.

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.720
I want you to think about how
well your eye is sampling that

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.810
by thinking about
whether or not you should

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:03.070
be able to see the
pixels from where

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:09.350
you're sitting based on the
sampling that's in your retina.

00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:14.060
So look at your
neighbor, say hi.

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:17.840
Figure out whether you have
enough rods and cones to see

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.580
individual pixels or not.

00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:55.780
OK.

00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:59.050
Does anybody-- so who can tell
me a way to think about this?

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.520
Or who can tell me the answer?

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.430
Do you have enough rods and
cones to sample the pixels

00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:04.030
on the screen?

00:09:04.030 --> 00:09:04.770
Yes?

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:05.339
AUDIENCE: No.

00:09:05.339 --> 00:09:06.130
DENNIS FREEMAN: No.

00:09:06.130 --> 00:09:07.276
AUDIENCE: I can't see them.

00:09:07.276 --> 00:09:08.900
DENNIS FREEMAN: You
can't-- you cannot.

00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:09.580
AUDIENCE: I don't
see the pixels.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:09.880
DENNIS FREEMAN: OK.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.860
Well, that could be
because you don't

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:13.496
have enough rods and cones.

00:09:13.496 --> 00:09:15.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:16.412 --> 00:09:18.160
AUDIENCE: I have
slight astigmatism.

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:18.951
DENNIS FREEMAN: Ah.

00:09:18.951 --> 00:09:19.520
Astigmatism.

00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.157
Is that a rod and cone problem?

00:09:21.157 --> 00:09:22.490
AUDIENCE: That's a lens problem.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:23.510
DENNIS FREEMAN:
That's a lens problem.

00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:26.470
So maybe you have enough rods
and cones and not enough lens.

00:09:28.785 --> 00:09:31.410
There's actually another reason
you might not be able to do it,

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.540
besides rods, cones, and lenses.

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:35.520
AUDIENCE: Your brain.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.530
DENNIS FREEMAN: Brain.

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.710
There's even another one.

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:38.210
OK.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.800
We're up to-- there's
another reason why

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.130
you might not be able to do it.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.308
Rods, cones, lenses, brains.

00:09:47.308 --> 00:09:49.688
AUDIENCE: Photons.

00:09:49.688 --> 00:09:51.720
AUDIENCE: Photons?

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.720
DENNIS FREEMAN: Photons.

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.740
That's an interesting thought.

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.870
I think you could probably
pull that off, yeah.

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:59.390
The number of photons-- if
the lighting were low enough--

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:01.550
your eyes are very sensitive.

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.970
You can see-- you can see--

00:10:04.970 --> 00:10:09.360
you can report a difference
with one photon, one.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.730
It's pretty little.

00:10:10.730 --> 00:10:13.110
It's kind of the limit, ? right?

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:14.372
Yeah?

00:10:14.372 --> 00:10:16.830
AUDIENCE: It's so far away
that I can't see the pixels.

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:19.454
DENNIS FREEMAN: It's so far away
that you can't see the pixels.

00:10:19.454 --> 00:10:20.290
But why?

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.562
Is it because you don't
have enough rods and cones,

00:10:22.562 --> 00:10:24.020
because your lenses
are screwed up?

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:25.484
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.170
DENNIS FREEMAN: So you might
be using your rods and cones

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:33.770
for different things.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:37.390
Your cones are focused in an
area called the fovea, right?

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:40.120
So one way you could improve
that would be to look at it.

00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:48.140
Can somebody think of something
besides rods, cones, lenses,

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:50.610
and brains?

00:10:50.610 --> 00:10:52.740
Can somebody think of
convolution lecture

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:58.750
with some sort of application
that we did in convolution?

00:10:58.750 --> 00:10:59.500
No, of course not.

00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:03.050
That was more than
10 lectures ago.

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:08.430
In convolution, we looked at
the Hubble Space Telescope

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.720
and we looked at a microscope.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:11.478
Yes?

00:11:11.478 --> 00:11:14.710
AUDIENCE: There's going to be
tons of particles in the air,

00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:15.210
so--

00:11:15.210 --> 00:11:16.751
DENNIS FREEMAN:
Particles in the air.

00:11:16.751 --> 00:11:18.960
That was something that
happened in Hubble.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:22.680
So smoke-filled
rooms, that's bad.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.110
From the Hubble experiment,
from the Hubble lecture

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.360
we talked about how there
was a point spread function

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.680
associated with diffraction.

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.630
And there's also a
diffraction limit because

00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:33.713
of the size of your pupil.

00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:39.250
Because you're looking
through a narrow aperture,

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.269
that limits the
resolution as well.

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:43.060
But let's get back to
this, rods and cones.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:44.351
You have enough rods and cones.

00:11:44.351 --> 00:11:47.110
How you do that?

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:50.761
How do you think about whether
you have enough rods and cones?

00:11:50.761 --> 00:11:51.260
OK.

00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.020
Step 1, look at
the previous slide.

00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:56.436
What was the important
thing on the previous slide?

00:11:56.436 --> 00:11:58.210
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:01.319
DENNIS FREEMAN: Three microns
per rod and cone, right?

00:12:01.319 --> 00:12:03.360
So rods and cones are
separated by three microns.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:06.720
So what do I do with that?

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:09.430
How do I compare rods and
cones three microns to this?

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:14.520
Anybody remember
anything about optics?

00:12:17.420 --> 00:12:20.059
So I have this big lens, right?

00:12:20.059 --> 00:12:21.850
And we have the eye on
one side and we have

00:12:21.850 --> 00:12:23.620
the object on the other side.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:28.330
And we need to map
some retina over here

00:12:28.330 --> 00:12:31.395
to some screen over here.

00:12:31.395 --> 00:12:33.520
What's important to do--
what's the important thing

00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.228
to do in the map?

00:12:38.271 --> 00:12:39.982
Oh, come on.

00:12:39.982 --> 00:12:41.690
Do you all remember
going to high school?

00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.290
No.

00:12:45.290 --> 00:12:46.580
OK.

00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:50.607
So if you have a lens, rays
go straight through a lens

00:12:50.607 --> 00:12:51.690
without being bent, right?

00:12:51.690 --> 00:12:53.270
That's one of the
rules for lenses.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:56.325
So that is enough information
actually to tell us the map.

00:12:56.325 --> 00:12:58.450
The map through a lens is
so as to preserve angles.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:05.050
So if we figure out
how closely spaced

00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:07.450
are the rods and
cones on this side,

00:13:07.450 --> 00:13:10.997
that'll give me some
angle that I can resolve.

00:13:10.997 --> 00:13:12.580
And the question is
whether that angle

00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.350
is bigger or smaller
than the angle that's

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:15.680
required to resolve the pixels.

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:22.450
So the angle-- so if we make
a small angle approximation,

00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:25.600
say that theta is on
the order of sine theta,

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:31.360
then the spacing between these
is like three micrometers.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.660
The distance between the lens
in your eye and the retina

00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:37.690
is on the order of, say,
three centimeters, something

00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:39.570
like that.

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:43.280
So that's the angle at your eye.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.190
And the question is,
how does that compare

00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:46.855
to the angle at the screen?

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:55.360
And so the screen, this
is like three meters.

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.650
But the pixels, there's
1,024 pixels in that range.

00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:09.430
And this distance is like 10
meters, something like that.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.620
So the question
is whether or not

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:13.930
the angle subtended
by the pixels

00:14:13.930 --> 00:14:16.630
is bigger or smaller
than the angle subtended

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:20.260
by the rods and cones, right?

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.710
That's the issue.

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:24.850
And so if you work
that out, the angle

00:14:24.850 --> 00:14:26.890
between the rods and cones
is on the order of 10

00:14:26.890 --> 00:14:29.270
to the minus 4 radian.

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.990
And the angle between
pixels is on the order

00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:34.700
of three times that.

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.340
So a couple of
interesting things.

00:14:36.340 --> 00:14:44.710
You have enough rods and cones
to see it, but only barely,

00:14:44.710 --> 00:14:47.200
by a factor of three, roughly.

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.640
I'm not worrying
about the fovea.

00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.690
The fovea has more.

00:14:52.147 --> 00:14:53.730
So this is just a
crude approximation.

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:57.720
I'm not worried about
your eyeglasses.

00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.080
But crudely speaking, you
have enough rods and cones

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.930
to resolve the pixels and
another factor of three or so,

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:07.050
which means, for example, that
making a projector with three

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:11.450
by three times more
pixels makes sense.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:15.270
And making one that's got 100
times 100 times more pixels

00:15:15.270 --> 00:15:15.770
doesn't.

00:15:18.035 --> 00:15:19.410
And that's the
kind of thing we'd

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:20.910
like to work out
when we're thinking

00:15:20.910 --> 00:15:25.170
about discrete
representations for signals.

00:15:25.170 --> 00:15:28.050
How many samples do you need?

00:15:28.050 --> 00:15:28.920
OK.

00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.750
So what we'd like to
do today is figure out

00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:34.230
how sampling affects
the information that's

00:15:34.230 --> 00:15:36.650
contained in a signal.

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:39.330
We'd like to sample a signal--

00:15:39.330 --> 00:15:41.240
so think about the
blue signal here

00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.680
and think about the red samples.

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:45.020
We'd like to sample
a signal in a way

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:47.480
that we preserve all of the
information about that signal.

00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.160
And as you can see from
the example that I picked,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:56.780
it's not at all clear
that you can do that.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.960
In fact, if you look
at the bottom picture,

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.550
I have coerced two signals to
follow on the same samples.

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:08.110
So the green signal is
the cos 7 pi n over 3

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.710
and the red signal is
the cos pi n over 3.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:16.070
And they all go through
the same blue samples.

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.600
The same blue samples is shared
by both of those signals.

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:26.940
So it's patently obvious that
I cannot uniquely reconstruct

00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:28.220
a signal from the samples.

00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:31.660
That's absolutely clear.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:36.700
It's also clear by just thinking
about the basic mathematics

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.970
of signals.

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:42.190
A CT signal could move
up and down arbitrarily

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:45.550
between two samples.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:47.290
How could you possibly
learn information

00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.810
about what happened
between the samples

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.670
by looking just at the samples?

00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.170
So it's not at all
clear that you're

00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:56.520
going to be able to do this.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.100
So let's take the opposite
tact, which is to say,

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:01.190
let's assume I only
have the samples.

00:17:01.190 --> 00:17:03.890
What can I tell you about what
the signal might have been?

00:17:03.890 --> 00:17:09.099
What's the relationship between
the samples and the signal?

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:10.480
And the way to
think about that--

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.849
one way is to think about
something that we will

00:17:12.849 --> 00:17:15.339
call impulse reconstruction.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:18.099
If I only had the
samples, what could I

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:22.660
do to reproduce a CT signal?

00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:25.839
The simplest thing I
might conceive of doing

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:32.680
is replace every sample
with some non-zero component

00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.900
of the CT representation.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.790
So I only have
samples up here at nT,

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:43.890
so generate a new CT
signal that contains

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:48.640
the information in the
samples, that is to say x of n,

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:51.370
which means I only
have an integer

00:17:51.370 --> 00:17:59.370
number of non-zero elements
in the CT representation.

00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:03.020
So in order to make that signal
have a non-zero integral,

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.570
the things I represent
each sample with better

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.780
be an impulse,
otherwise I would have

00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:13.664
finitely many non-zero points
in a finite time interval,

00:18:13.664 --> 00:18:15.080
and the integral
over the interval

00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:17.150
would be 0 always, right?

00:18:17.150 --> 00:18:18.687
So I have to use impulses.

00:18:18.687 --> 00:18:20.270
So the simplest thing
I could do would

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:22.130
be to take every
one of these samples

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:26.780
and replace it by an impulse
located at the right time,

00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:31.790
so put the n-th one at
time t equals n cap T,

00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:34.190
put it where the
sample came from,

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.650
and scale the weight
to be in proportion

00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:39.170
to the amplitude of x of n.

00:18:39.170 --> 00:18:41.420
That's kind of the simplest
thing I could possibly do.

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:43.250
That's called impulse
reconstruction.

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:45.110
And then lets ask
the question, how

00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:52.520
does the x that I started with
relate to this xP, this impulse

00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.352
reconstruction thing
that I just made?

00:18:55.352 --> 00:18:57.560
And as you might imagine
from the theory of lectures,

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.860
that relationship is
going to be simple, right?

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:04.440
So think about, what am I doing?

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:07.235
I'm trying to think about
I started with x of n--

00:19:07.235 --> 00:19:10.400
I started with x of T, sorry.

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.570
I turned that into samples.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:17.750
I turned that into xP of t.

00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.600
And now I'm trying to
compare those two signals.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.440
That's the game plan.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:26.990
So think about x of P
from the previous slide.

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:30.020
It's weighted impulses
shifted in time

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.100
to the appropriate place.

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:40.770
This x of n was derived by
uniform sampling of x of t,

00:19:40.770 --> 00:19:41.970
so x of n was x of nT.

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:50.750
And since this impulse is
0 everywhere except where

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:54.970
the argument is 0,
it doesn't matter

00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:59.490
whether I call this thing
nT or T, same thing,

00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:05.100
because the impulse only
looks at t equals nT.

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.220
So whether I call it
nT or t is irrelevant.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:12.210
If I call it t, then
this part has no n in it

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.390
and I can factor it outside and
I just get an impulse train.

00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:21.440
And not too surprisingly,
xP is just the product--

00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:27.290
this signal is just this signal
multiplied by an impulse train.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:37.460
So if I derive xP by
multiplying by an impulse train,

00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:39.220
your knee-jerk
reaction is to say--

00:20:42.090 --> 00:20:43.380
multiply by an impulse train?

00:20:48.310 --> 00:20:50.060
AUDIENCE: Sounds like
a Fourier transform.

00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:52.670
DENNIS FREEMAN: Sounds like a
Fourier transform somewhere.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.770
If I multiply in time
by an impulse train,

00:20:54.770 --> 00:20:59.250
what do I do in
Fourier transform land?

00:20:59.250 --> 00:21:01.490
Convolve, right?

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:04.650
Multiply in time,
convolve in frequency.

00:21:04.650 --> 00:21:07.370
So if this was my
original x, this thing,

00:21:07.370 --> 00:21:11.860
if this is the
transform of that thing,

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.120
and if this is the transform
of my impulse train--

00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.580
transform of an
impulse train in time

00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.820
is an impulse
train in frequency.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.140
The impulses in frequency
are separated by omega

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.810
s equal to 2 pi over t.

00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:31.890
And the amplitude is equal
to omega s, 2 pi over t.

00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:34.800
So there's space and have an
amplitude, both the spacing

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.430
and the amplitude are
2 pi over t, right?

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:43.131
And if I'm multiplying
in time x times P,

00:21:43.131 --> 00:21:45.270
I convolve in frequency.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:48.780
So this is my answer.

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.590
What's the relationship
between x and xP?

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:55.710
It's multiplied in time
by an impulse train,

00:21:55.710 --> 00:22:00.660
or it's convolved in frequency
with an impulse train.

00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:04.020
So the answer how
does xP relate to x,

00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.730
it looks very similar
for some frequencies.

00:22:08.730 --> 00:22:10.410
But there's a lot
more frequencies.

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:14.090
Not too surprising.

00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:15.180
I multiply by impulses.

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.990
Impulses have all
frequencies, right?

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:23.040
So what I've done
when I've sampled it,

00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.100
if I think about the sampled
signal being represented

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:30.960
in CT as the multiplication
by an infinite impulse train,

00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:36.180
I've introduced new
frequency components

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.800
to the Fourier representation.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:39.450
That's the main message.

00:22:39.450 --> 00:22:42.600
This slide is today's lecture.

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:46.530
The way we can think
about sampling in time

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:48.881
is as convolution in frequency.

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:53.300
OK.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.326
So let's think about
that a little more.

00:22:55.326 --> 00:22:57.200
What I just talked about
was the relationship

00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.451
between the Fourier
transforms of x and xP.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.510
But the goal is to
think about the samples.

00:23:05.510 --> 00:23:09.320
So what's the relationship
between the DT, the Discrete

00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:14.780
Time Fourier transform
of the sampled signal,

00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:18.560
and the continuous time Fourier
transform of this impulse

00:23:18.560 --> 00:23:19.550
reconstruction?

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:24.810
So I've already for you--

00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:26.670
I've compared the frequency--

00:23:26.670 --> 00:23:29.220
the Fourier representations
of these two.

00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:32.220
As an exercise, you compare
the frequency representations

00:23:32.220 --> 00:23:33.270
of those two.

00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:35.640
And figure out if any of
these are the right way

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.479
to look at it.

00:23:37.479 --> 00:23:38.520
So look at your neighbor.

00:25:15.370 --> 00:25:17.500
So which one best
describes the relationship

00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.240
between those Fourier
representations?

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.490
Number 1, 2, 3, or
none of the above?

00:25:27.881 --> 00:25:28.380
OK.

00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.690
So 100%, I think.

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:36.960
So easier question, is
x of e to the j omega--

00:25:39.470 --> 00:25:46.430
x of e to the j omega, so this
one, x of e to the j omega,

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:51.840
is that a periodic or
aperiodic function of omega?

00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:53.289
AUDIENCE: Periodic.

00:25:53.289 --> 00:25:54.330
DENNIS FREEMAN: Periodic.

00:25:54.330 --> 00:25:55.079
What's the period?

00:25:59.679 --> 00:26:01.470
What's the period of
x of e to the j omega?

00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:09.698
What's the period
of e to the j omega?

00:26:09.698 --> 00:26:11.189
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:14.670 --> 00:26:17.280
DENNIS FREEMAN: So I'm hearing
about the three not quite

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.230
correct answers.

00:26:19.230 --> 00:26:21.750
They all kind of have
the right stuff in them.

00:26:21.750 --> 00:26:24.000
What's the period
of e to the j omega?

00:26:26.794 --> 00:26:27.960
What's the period of cosine?

00:26:33.195 --> 00:26:35.482
What's the period of cosine?

00:26:35.482 --> 00:26:36.265
AUDIENCE: 2 pi.

00:26:36.265 --> 00:26:37.140
DENNIS FREEMAN: 2 pi.

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:39.431
Thank you.

00:26:39.431 --> 00:26:39.930
OK.

00:26:39.930 --> 00:26:42.870
So this one's periodic in 2
pi, so x of e to the j omega

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.630
is periodic in 2 pi
because e to the j omega

00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.250
is periodic in 2 pi, right?

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:51.180
How about xP of j omega?

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:53.340
Is that periodic or aperiodic?

00:26:57.330 --> 00:26:59.690
xP of j omega.

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:03.890
xP is the signal that I got when
I multiplied in the time domain

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.430
x of t times p of t, p of
t being an impulse train.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:09.470
Take an impulse train times
the time domain signal,

00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:10.780
and that's how I got xP.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.240
And then xP is the
transform of that.

00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:19.549
Is the transform of xP
periodic or aperiodic?

00:27:19.549 --> 00:27:20.340
AUDIENCE: Periodic.

00:27:20.340 --> 00:27:21.381
DENNIS FREEMAN: Periodic.

00:27:21.381 --> 00:27:23.764
What's a period of xP?

00:27:23.764 --> 00:27:25.612
AUDIENCE: 2 pi over T.

00:27:25.612 --> 00:27:28.070
DENNIS FREEMAN: 2
pi over T precisely.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:32.470
So this one is
periodic in omega.

00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:41.090
2 pi-- I shouldn't
write it that way,

00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:45.850
I should say that
the period is 2 pi.

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:53.190
And here, the period of
omega is 2 pi over T.

00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:55.620
So what's the relationship
between omega and omega?

00:27:58.570 --> 00:28:01.180
In order to make a function--

00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.070
in order to make a
function that is similar,

00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:11.120
we're going to have to
have omega is omega over T.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.016
OK?

00:28:12.016 --> 00:28:14.140
We're going to have to
convert the units of capital

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:17.930
omega, which are radians, into
the units of little omega,

00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.620
which is radians per second.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:25.067
So we need a time in the bottom.

00:28:25.067 --> 00:28:27.400
And if you want to be a little
bit more formal about it,

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.620
you can just write
out the definitions.

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:30.760
I did this last time.

00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.490
This was from two lectures ago.

00:28:33.490 --> 00:28:35.989
So here's the definition
of the discrete time

00:28:35.989 --> 00:28:37.030
Fourier transform, right?

00:28:37.030 --> 00:28:38.530
You take the samples
and weight them

00:28:38.530 --> 00:28:41.650
by e to the minus j omega n.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.710
Here's the definition of
the CT Fourier transform,

00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:50.340
where I've substituted
xP of t is this thing.

00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:56.770
It's a string of impulses,
each weighted by x of n.

00:28:56.770 --> 00:28:59.694
And then I interchanged the
integral and the summation.

00:28:59.694 --> 00:29:02.110
And I don't worry about whether
it's going to work or not.

00:29:02.110 --> 00:29:04.443
You have to take a following
course, Course 18, in order

00:29:04.443 --> 00:29:07.390
to figure out whether that
makes sense or not, but it does.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:12.830
So I interchange the order and
then the end part factors out

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:18.010
and this just sifts out
the value of omega--

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.410
the value of t and nT.

00:29:20.410 --> 00:29:22.600
So I replace then
this t with nT.

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.220
The integral goes away.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:27.280
And I end up with something that
looks almost exactly like that,

00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.230
except that capital
omega has turned

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:33.930
into a little omega times T.

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.390
So the discrete time
Fourier transform

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:41.350
is just a scaled in
frequency version

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:45.570
of this impulse-sampled
original signal.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:51.586
So the impulse reconstruction
is related to the Fourier--

00:29:51.586 --> 00:29:53.710
the Fourier transform of
the impulse reconstruction

00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:57.930
is related to the Fourier
transform in samples

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.650
by scaling frequencies that way.

00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.800
So those representations
have the same information

00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:11.610
precisely, except for
the scaling of frequency.

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:14.010
The period in the
bottom waveform is 2 pi.

00:30:14.010 --> 00:30:20.280
The period in this one
is 2 pi over capital T.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.035
So the answer to the
question then is easy.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.160
The original question
was, under what

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:30.320
conditions can I
sample in a way that

00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:33.650
preserves the information
in the original signal?

00:30:33.650 --> 00:30:37.820
Well, this diagram makes
it relatively clear.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:40.340
If the original x was just
one of these triangles

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:47.860
and xP is the periodic
extension of that, then so long

00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:53.180
as the periodic extensions
don't overlap with each other,

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:59.890
I can derive x from xP by
simply low-pass filtering.

00:30:59.890 --> 00:31:01.810
Throw away the
frequencies that got

00:31:01.810 --> 00:31:04.520
introduced by the convolution
with an impulse train.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:11.060
So as long as the
frequencies don't overlap,

00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.210
as long as there's a clean
spot here where there's nothing

00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:17.290
happening, as long
as the frequencies

00:31:17.290 --> 00:31:20.650
of the periodic
extensions don't overlap,

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:24.160
then I can sample in
a way that contains

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.660
all of the information
of the original,

00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:31.570
so long as when I'm all
done, I low-pass filter.

00:31:31.570 --> 00:31:34.550
That's called the
sampling theorem.

00:31:34.550 --> 00:31:37.900
So the sampling theorem,
which is not at all obvious

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.640
if you don't think about
the Fourier space--

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:44.760
if you only started with the
time domain representations

00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:46.440
that I showed in the
first few slides,

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:49.320
it's not at all
obvious that there even

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:53.220
is a way to sample in an
information-preserving fashion.

00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:54.840
But what we've just
seen is that it's

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.200
really simple to think about
it in the Fourier domain.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.390
Thinking about it in the
Fourier domain gives rise

00:32:00.390 --> 00:32:02.550
to what we call the
sampling theorem, which

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.070
says that if a signal
is bandlimited--

00:32:05.070 --> 00:32:07.680
that has to do with
this overlap part--

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.180
if the signal is
bandlimited that

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.490
means that all of the
non-zero frequency elements

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:16.380
are in some band of frequencies,
nothing outside that band.

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.690
Outside some band, I don't
care what the band is,

00:32:18.690 --> 00:32:22.680
but outside that band, the
Fourier transform has to be 0.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.920
If the Fourier transform
is 0 outside some band,

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:29.070
then it's possible to
sample in a way that

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:35.100
preserves all the information
so long as I sample fast enough.

00:32:35.100 --> 00:32:38.900
So if the original signal is
bandlimited so that the Fourier

00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:45.350
transform is 0 for frequencies
above some frequency omega m,

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.410
then x is uniquely
determined by its samples.

00:32:49.410 --> 00:32:52.250
Uniquely means that
I can do an inverse.

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:54.000
So it's uniquely
determined by the samples

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.050
if and only if omega s,
this is sampling frequency,

00:32:59.050 --> 00:33:01.030
which is 2 pi over t--

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:05.130
that's the period of
the impulse train.

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:12.910
So if 2 pi over t exceeds
twice the frequency of the band

00:33:12.910 --> 00:33:14.170
limit.

00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:16.480
We'll see in a minute where
the factor of 2 comes from.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.630
The factor of 2 comes
from negative frequencies.

00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:22.600
So the sampling
theorem says that there

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.760
is a way for a certain
kind of signal.

00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:26.950
Signals that are
bandlimited can be

00:33:26.950 --> 00:33:31.610
sampled in a way that
preserves all the information.

00:33:31.610 --> 00:33:32.980
So here is a summary.

00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.920
If you sample uniformly-- that's
not the only kind of sampling

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:39.312
we do in practice, but it's the
basis of all of our theories

00:33:39.312 --> 00:33:41.770
for the way sampling works, so
that's the only one we're do

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:42.940
in 003.

00:33:42.940 --> 00:33:45.910
But just for your
intellectual edification,

00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:48.640
there are more sophisticated
ways to sample.

00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.784
And in fact, that's a
topic of current research.

00:33:51.784 --> 00:33:53.200
But for the time
being, we're only

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:55.210
going to worry about
uniform sampling.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:57.700
If you sample a signal
uniformly in time,

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.920
that is every capital
T seconds, then you

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:05.920
can do bandlimited
reconstruction,

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:10.330
which means that replace every
sample with an impulse weighted

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:13.750
by the sample weight
and spaced in time

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:17.110
where it would have come from.

00:34:17.110 --> 00:34:20.380
Then run it through an
ideal low-pass filter

00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:23.710
to get rid of the stuff
that high frequency copies.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.020
And what comes out
will be equal to that,

00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:29.110
as long as you've satisfied
this relationship,

00:34:29.110 --> 00:34:33.340
that the frequencies that
are contained in the signal

00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:36.600
must be less than the
sampling frequency over 2.

00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:41.139
OK.

00:34:41.139 --> 00:34:42.909
So what's the implication
of the sampling theorem?

00:34:42.909 --> 00:34:44.199
Think about a
particular problem.

00:34:44.199 --> 00:34:46.490
We can hear sounds with
frequency components that range

00:34:46.490 --> 00:34:48.100
from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz.

00:34:51.739 --> 00:34:55.520
What's the minimum-- what's
the biggest sampling interval T

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.632
that we can use to retain all
of the information in a signal

00:34:59.632 --> 00:35:00.340
that we can hear?

00:37:03.725 --> 00:37:04.600
So what's the answer?

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.640
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6?

00:37:12.011 --> 00:37:12.510
OK.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.720
A sort of shrinking
number of votes and sort

00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.470
of a shrinking number
of correct votes.

00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:20.950
So it's about 75%.

00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:24.010
The only tricky part really
is thinking about frequencies.

00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:28.191
So I told you frequencies in
the commonly used engineering

00:37:28.191 --> 00:37:28.690
terms--

00:37:28.690 --> 00:37:30.370
I told you that we
hear frequencies

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:33.747
from 20 to 20,000 hertz.

00:37:33.747 --> 00:37:35.830
In this course, we usually
think about frequencies

00:37:35.830 --> 00:37:38.100
as omega radian frequency.

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.530
Hertz are cycles per second.

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.690
There's 2 pi radians--

00:37:44.690 --> 00:37:46.290
hertz are cycles per second.

00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:53.260
Radian frequency is cycles
per second radians per second.

00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:57.424
There's 2 pi radians per cycle.

00:37:57.424 --> 00:37:58.340
OK.

00:37:58.340 --> 00:37:58.840
Sorry.

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:00.460
I screwed that up.

00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:02.980
Hertz is cycles per second.

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:05.230
Omega is radians per second.

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:09.100
The conversion is 2
pi radians per cycle.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:11.452
So we need to have--

00:38:11.452 --> 00:38:12.910
the highest frequency
in the signal

00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:14.980
has to be smaller than the
sampling frequency divided

00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:15.480
by 2.

00:38:18.952 --> 00:38:20.410
The highest frequency
in the signal

00:38:20.410 --> 00:38:26.330
is 2 pi fm, if f is
frequencies 20 to 20 kilohertz.

00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:31.204
And the sampling frequency
is 2 pi over capital T.

00:38:31.204 --> 00:38:32.870
So you clear the
fraction and figure out

00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:36.820
that T has to be smaller
than 25 microseconds.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:39.850
OK.

00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:43.690
So the idea then is
that there's a way

00:38:43.690 --> 00:38:50.190
of thinking about any signal
with a finite bandwidth--

00:38:50.190 --> 00:38:52.720
there's a way of
sampling using uniform

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:55.420
sampling so that you can
sample that signal without loss

00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.950
of information.

00:38:56.950 --> 00:38:59.324
All you need to do is
figure out how frequently

00:38:59.324 --> 00:39:00.240
you need to sample it.

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.987
Yes?

00:39:01.987 --> 00:39:02.945
AUDIENCE: Implications?

00:39:02.945 --> 00:39:05.932
A signal is not badlimited.

00:39:05.932 --> 00:39:07.890
DENNIS FREEMAN: If a
signal is not bandlimited,

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:08.681
you have a problem.

00:39:08.681 --> 00:39:10.970
AUDIENCE: Is it
possible to [INAUDIBLE]?

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.700
DENNIS FREEMAN: So the
question is, to what extent--

00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.420
is it possible to sample a
signal that is not bandlimited?

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.570
So that's the next topic.

00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:26.370
So the question I'm
going to address now

00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:29.160
is, well, what happens if you
don't satisfy the sampling

00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.450
theorem?

00:39:30.450 --> 00:39:32.430
What if there are frequency
components that are

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:36.820
outside the admissible band--

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:42.455
the admissible region
of frequencies?

00:39:42.455 --> 00:39:43.830
So to think about
that, I'm going

00:39:43.830 --> 00:39:48.760
to think about this as
a model of sampling.

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.976
So I think about--

00:39:49.976 --> 00:39:54.420
and the value of the model
is that it's entirely in CT.

00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:56.880
It gets confusing
when you mix domains

00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:00.000
and you have to compare
this kind of a frequency

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.230
to that kind of frequency.

00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:05.250
So what I'm going to do is
think about it entirely in CT

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:08.130
by making a model of
how sampling works.

00:40:08.130 --> 00:40:12.120
Sampling is equivalent to take
the original signal that you're

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:14.780
trying to sample, multiply by
an impulse train showed here.

00:40:17.490 --> 00:40:21.240
You get out this xP thing
that we've been talking about.

00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:23.550
And then run that through
an ideal low-pass filter.

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.290
And if this comes out
looking like that,

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:31.872
then the sampling preserves
all of the information.

00:40:31.872 --> 00:40:33.580
Now what I want to do
is think about what

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:37.462
happens when I put in a signal
for which that doesn't hold.

00:40:37.462 --> 00:40:39.420
So let's start with the
simplest possible case.

00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.910
Let's think about
a tone, so a signal

00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:46.130
that contains a single
frequency components.

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:51.040
So I'm representing that by a
cosine wave, cosine omega o T.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.570
So I'm representing that by
two impulses, Euler's equation.

00:40:55.570 --> 00:41:00.430
And I'm thinking about some
sampling waveform, where

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:02.920
I'm looking at it here in
frequency, so the spacing is

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:07.420
2 pi over T. And if the
frequencies in the signal

00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:10.300
are smaller than 1/2 of
the maximum frequency omega

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.587
s, everything should work.

00:41:12.587 --> 00:41:14.170
And you can sort of
see in the Fourier

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:16.390
picture what's happening.

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.730
When I convolve
these two signals--

00:41:18.730 --> 00:41:22.140
I multiply in time, so I'm
convolving in frequency.

00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:24.670
When I convolve this
with the impulse train,

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:32.390
this impulse brings this
pair of frequencies here.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:36.330
But this impulse brings
this pair up here.

00:41:36.330 --> 00:41:39.990
And then this one brings
this pair up here.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:41.630
So I repeat.

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:45.540
So I get a repetition
then of the original two

00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:49.341
at integer multiples of omega s.

00:41:49.341 --> 00:41:49.840
OK.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.180
So if I low-pass filter
then with the red line,

00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:52.930
everything's fine.

00:41:52.930 --> 00:41:54.804
I end up with a signal
with the output that's

00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:58.530
the same single as
the input, no problem.

00:41:58.530 --> 00:42:02.240
What happens, however,
as I increase frequency?

00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.410
Same thing.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.540
The originals are
reproduced here.

00:42:05.540 --> 00:42:08.880
The modulation by this
brings this up to here.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:11.100
The low-pass filter
still separates it out.

00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:13.960
The problem is here.

00:42:13.960 --> 00:42:19.760
Now I'm running into trouble,
because the original signal

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:24.936
fell right on the edge of
my limit, omega s over 2.

00:42:24.936 --> 00:42:26.310
And the problem's
even more clear

00:42:26.310 --> 00:42:27.890
if I go to an even
higher frequency.

00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.720
So now, this component
is coming out here,

00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:34.662
which is outside the box.

00:42:34.662 --> 00:42:36.120
The thing that's
happening, though,

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.320
is that convolution
with this guy

00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:42.570
is bringing in an element
that is spaced by omega s

00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:45.450
and is now inside the box.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:46.280
That's bad.

00:42:49.060 --> 00:42:50.710
Everybody see what's happening?

00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:53.790
So I'm just studying what
happens as I have one frequency

00:42:53.790 --> 00:42:55.890
and vary the
frequency-- if I have

00:42:55.890 --> 00:42:57.360
a tone at a single
frequency and I

00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:00.330
vary the frequency
of the tone, as long

00:43:00.330 --> 00:43:04.020
as the frequency is inside
my limit, omega s over 2,

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:06.080
I'm fine.

00:43:06.080 --> 00:43:08.760
The low-pass filter
reconstructs the original.

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:13.110
But something bizarre
happens whenever I'm outside.

00:43:13.110 --> 00:43:16.829
And to see what's going
on, it's easiest to see

00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:18.870
what's going on by making
a map between the input

00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:22.470
frequency and the
apparent frequency,

00:43:22.470 --> 00:43:24.580
the apparent frequency
of the output.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.370
So what happens if I'm
at a low frequency,

00:43:27.370 --> 00:43:29.580
I'm on a linear relationship
between the input

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.230
frequency and the output.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:35.390
The output reproduces
the input exactly.

00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:38.420
And you can see as I'm
increasing the frequency,

00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:41.750
I'm just sampling this
function at a different place.

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:45.106
But when I go higher, it
appears as though the frequency

00:43:45.106 --> 00:43:45.605
got smaller.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:53.430
We call that aliasing.

00:43:53.430 --> 00:43:56.500
This is a question to get you
to think through aliasing.

00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.800
But in the interest of
time, because I have a demo,

00:43:59.800 --> 00:44:02.570
I'll leave this for
you to think about.

00:44:02.570 --> 00:44:05.230
So the question is,
thinking about what's

00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:08.350
the effect of aliasing and
where do the new frequencies

00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:11.380
land relative to the
input frequency--

00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:13.600
they have this funny
folding property.

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:16.885
And the effect of the folding
property kind of wreaks havoc.

00:44:20.010 --> 00:44:26.250
So I'll skip this for now
and just jump to the idea

00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:28.650
that the intuition
that we get by thinking

00:44:28.650 --> 00:44:31.620
about single frequencies carries
over to complex frequency

00:44:31.620 --> 00:44:32.830
representations.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:36.390
So now what if my message, what
if my input had this triangular

00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:39.890
frequency Fourier
transform, rather than

00:44:39.890 --> 00:44:42.840
just a single spike?

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:45.360
And so I'm sampling
it as showed here,

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.830
so this is my impulse
train and frequency.

00:44:47.830 --> 00:44:51.780
And as before, the message gets
reproduced at integer multiples

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.960
of omega s.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:58.020
And as long as the bandwidth
of the message is small enough,

00:44:58.020 --> 00:45:01.050
I can put the red
low-pass filter

00:45:01.050 --> 00:45:07.140
to eliminate the copies
from the periodic extension,

00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:10.700
and I get an output
that's equal to the input.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.390
The problem is
that if I increase

00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:18.440
the bandwidth of the
input, as I increase

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:21.050
the bandwidth of the
input, the margin

00:45:21.050 --> 00:45:26.450
between the base signal
and the periodic extension

00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:28.430
gets smaller.

00:45:28.430 --> 00:45:34.900
And if the bandwidth gets too
great, they begin to overlap.

00:45:34.900 --> 00:45:38.520
So now if I low-pass
filter this signal,

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.430
I pick up the desired
blue part of this,

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:44.670
but the undesired
green part of that.

00:45:44.670 --> 00:45:47.940
And the result is
that the signal is not

00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:50.820
a faithful reproduction
of what I started with.

00:45:50.820 --> 00:45:54.420
Same sort of thing happens if
I hold the message constant

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:57.800
and change the
frequency spacing.

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.350
As long as I sample with
big enough frequencies--

00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:02.000
that is small enough times.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.240
There's an inverse relationship
between frequency and time.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:08.210
If the frequency is big enough
so the times are short enough,

00:46:08.210 --> 00:46:12.084
I can reproduce what
the signal looked like.

00:46:12.084 --> 00:46:18.400
But now if I change the
sampling to happen slower,

00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.590
I start to get aliasing.

00:46:20.590 --> 00:46:22.570
So it's exactly analogous.

00:46:22.570 --> 00:46:25.780
So that means that if
you have a fixed signal,

00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:28.210
there's some minimum
rate at which you

00:46:28.210 --> 00:46:32.860
have to sample it in order
to not lose information.

00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:34.870
So what I want to do
now is demonstrate that

00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:37.220
by thinking about music.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:42.430
So I have a cut of music that
was originally taken from a CD,

00:46:42.430 --> 00:46:44.830
so it was sampled
at 44.1 kilohertz.

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:48.620
That's standard CD
frequency sampling.

00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:55.000
And I've re-sampled it
at 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.130
And I'm going to play
what happens when I

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:01.717
do these various re-samplings.

00:48:01.357 --> 00:48:01.870
OK.

00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:05.930
Some you may have been able
to tell the difference.

00:48:05.930 --> 00:48:09.590
So the idea is
that by decreasing

00:48:09.590 --> 00:48:11.930
the rate at which I'm
sampling it in time,

00:48:11.930 --> 00:48:15.140
I get fewer samples in the total
signal, which makes it easier

00:48:15.140 --> 00:48:17.540
to store and increases
the amount of stuff

00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.730
that I could put
on a given medium.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.500
That's good.

00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:24.020
Problem is, it
doesn't sound as good.

00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:28.160
So every step down this
path resulted in 1/2

00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.650
the information of
the previous one,

00:48:30.650 --> 00:48:32.540
which means that I could
double the capacity

00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.260
of your MP3 player.

00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:40.250
But there was distortions
added because of this aliasing

00:48:40.250 --> 00:48:44.150
problem, because some of
the frequencies at the lower

00:48:44.150 --> 00:48:49.850
sampling rates were too large
to be faithfully reproduced

00:48:49.850 --> 00:48:51.950
by the sampling.

00:48:51.950 --> 00:48:55.970
They got moved, they got
aliased to the wrong place.

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:58.659
That gives rise to sounds
that are inharmonic

00:48:58.659 --> 00:48:59.450
and they sound bad.

00:49:08.190 --> 00:49:11.640
So this just recapitulates what
we were seeing in the demo.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:15.930
I started out barely having
enough bandwidth to represent

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:17.750
the original signal.

00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:22.550
And as I made the sampling
frequency smaller,

00:49:22.550 --> 00:49:27.290
making the distance
between samples bigger--

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:30.770
as I made the frequency
of the sampling smaller,

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:33.830
I started to get overlap, and
that's what sounded funny.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:37.160
So the slower I sampled, the
more overlap and the funnier

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.210
it sounded.

00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:40.370
So the question
is, what can you--

00:49:40.370 --> 00:49:41.960
how can you deal with that?

00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:46.790
One way you can deal with that
is what we call anti-aliasing.

00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:50.870
So it's very bad if you put
a frequency into a sampling

00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:55.400
system where the frequency
is too big to be faithfully

00:49:55.400 --> 00:49:58.580
reproduced, because it comes out
at a different frequency that

00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.480
cannot be determined
from the output alone.

00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.730
So how can you deal with that?

00:50:03.730 --> 00:50:07.660
One way you can deal
with it is to pre-filter,

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:12.960
take out everything that could
be offensive before you sample.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.780
That's called anti-aliasing.

00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:22.040
And the result is not faithful
reproduction of the original.

00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:24.530
But it's at least
faithful reproduction

00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:29.410
of the part of the band
that is reproduced.

00:50:29.410 --> 00:50:32.910
So it's not distortion-free.

00:50:32.910 --> 00:50:36.420
The transformation from the
very input to the very output

00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:37.410
is not--

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:39.420
there's not a unity
transformation,

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:41.430
because you violated
the sampling theorem.

00:50:41.430 --> 00:50:46.180
But at least you don't alias
frequencies to the wrong place.

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:47.850
So the result t--

00:50:47.850 --> 00:50:52.206
I'll play without anti-aliasing,
with anti-aliasing, without,

00:50:52.206 --> 00:50:53.996
with, without, with.

00:52:03.390 --> 00:52:03.935
OK.

00:52:03.935 --> 00:52:07.400
So the final one didn't sound
exactly like the original,

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.250
but at least it wasn't grating.

00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:12.822
So the idea, then, is just
that sampling's very important.

00:52:12.822 --> 00:52:14.780
And by thinking about it
in the Fourier domain,

00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.720
we get a lot of insights that we
wouldn't have gotten otherwise.
